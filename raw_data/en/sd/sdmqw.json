ASDREWS PREFACE THE subject of Incubation, which has hitherto received merely cursory notice from English wiitere, is of interest to modern readers for two reasona. In the first place, the practice\u2014designated without ambiguity in German as \" Tempelschlaf,\" i.e.. Temple-sleep\u2014 is one which, in virtue of its origin, belongs to paganism, but is countenanced and encouraged in the twentieth century by two of the chief sections of the Christian Church And secoudly, it produces results which have much in common with hypnotic cures and the achievements of Christian Science. The aim of the present work is to give an historical sketch of the development of the practice of Incubation from the earliest times down to the present day. While pursuing this research, I held a Scholarship in History from tlic Cnrnegie Trust for the Universities of Scotland, and I must here acknowledge my in\u00ad debtedness to the Trust for this opportunity of post-graduate study. My obligations to previous students and travellers are obvious.

Incubation in Pagan Temples I, Introduction IN the ancient science of divination, four working methods were commonly practised. Revelations of the future were deduced from natural portents, from the flight of birds, from entrails of sacrificial victims, or from dreams. It was the fourth way that had, for obvious reasons, the greatest vogue. Belief in the sig\u00ad nificance of dreams baa always been widespread, and the supernatural authority attached to them by the ancients needs no demonstration. From Pharaoh's dream downwards there are recorded many illustra\u00ad tions of the importance with which they were regarded not only by the ignorant and superstitious, bat b; pbiiosophical thinkera. The philosophy of dreams, as they were regarded in the fourth century B.C., was held to be that in sleep the sou! was freed from the body so that it could soar into spiritual regions, and commuae with divine beings. Accordingly, memories of what bad passed in sleep were to be cber^hed as divine revelations granted to the soul. The science of oneiromancy was the subject of much study, Artemidoros of Epbesus has five books of Oneirocntica, where he attempts some explications and relates many instances of dreams. Dreams are divided by him into five classes, of which the fifth is the most 2 INTHODDCTION important for divination. That is the class of chrematismoi or oracles. The division given by Artemidoros is found again in Macrobius, Sotrinium Scipionis (i, 3), where the following definition of an oracle is given;\u2014\" It is a ease of an oracle when, during sleep, a relative, or other sacred or authoritative person, or a priest, or even a god, declares openly what ia going to happen, or not to happen, or what must be done or avoided.'' Two other kinds of dreams worthy of interpretation are given\u2014the vision, and the somnium or dream proper. In the vision, a person sees what is going to happen in exactly the way in which it will take place, and the somnium is a dream so complicated and obscured by figures that it cannot be understood with\u00ad out interpretation. Incubation was the method by which men sought to entice such dreama. Visions, in which a revelation regarding the future was given by a god or a divine messenger, would be precious and greatly to be desired by those who believed in their infallibility. Naturally people would seek for divine guidance in distress and difficulty, and out of their efforts to obtain it arose the practice of incubation. Suppliants approached the god by sacrifices and performance of rites best calculated to win his favour, and then in the place most likely to be visited by the deity, either the temple, or the appointed sleeping-hall, lay down to sleep awaiting a divine visitation. The gods in whose temples incubation was practised wore chthonian deities, heroes who had gone down into the earth and were invested with her powere. Two of the chief faculties of the earth were the power INTRODDCTIOK 3 of sending dreams, and the gift of healing. As a giver of dreams she is apostrophised in the Hecuba of Euripides (1. TO) :\u2014\" O Lady Earth, sender of black- winged dreams,\" The healing powers of the earth were expressed in the production of herbs that gave life or death, and were tr.msniitted to the chthonian gods who had entered into her. The combination of these two faculties brought it to pass that the temples of these deities were the centres of medical divination, obtained through incuba\u00ad tion. Illness was the most frequent motive for con\u00ad sultation; hence the primary aspect of incubation is medical. But the gods were not consulted solely on account of disease. In any case of difficulty or distress incubation might be tried. PausaniaB (iii. 26. 1) relates how the Spartan Ephors during state crises were in the habit of consulting the incubation-oracle of Ino-Pasiphaai at Thalamai. Other instances of non-medical consultation are recorded In the Orations of Aristides and elsewhere. The object of the practice was to meet with the deity in sleep, ask questions, and receive answers. The suppliant was not always successful. It might be that no visitation came to him, the dream might be un\u00ad intelligible, or he might fail to interpret it correctly. Artemidoros, in Ondrocritica (iv. 22), gives his views of the instructions sent by gods who have been invoked through incubation. The paragraph is entitled \" Con\u00ad cerning Prescriptions.\" \" Too will find the prescriptions of the gods either simple and containing no enigma, for the gods pre\u00ad scribe ointments, plasters, food and drink, by the same names as we use; or when the gods do speak in enig-i INTHODUOTJON mas, their enigmas arc quite clear. For example, a woman who had inflammation of the breast thought that she was suckled by a sheep. She was cured by a plaster of the herb sheep's-tonftue; the composition of the plant's name showed the connection between the herb and the sheep's tongue. Do not decide your dream from one conjecture, so that yoa do not fall into error and appear foolish. For example, a man who was ill thought he saw a person called Feison. This was interpreted as meaning great safety and security, and also it was said he would live ninety-five years after the first appearance of Peison. Nevertheless the man who had seen the vision died during the same illness, for Peison had appeared to him carrying sweet oil. Sweet oil is baleful in the case of illness, because of its connection with dead bodies.\" Dcubner, in his treatise De Incubatione (ch. i.) shows the existence of a certain similarity of characteristics in dreams which have come during incubation, as recorded in the ancient writers. The Orations of Aelius Aristides relate with great detail the accompanying circumstances and effects of numerous dreams, and these are conhrmed by many other cases. In the second Sacred Oration (p. 414), he says of Asklepios : \" A voice come to me by night, saying,\" and (p. 4-20) \" A voice came in a dream.\" The bearing of a voice was a common sensation. Plutarch, De Genio Sni-rntis (221. relating the experi\u00ad ences at oracle of Trophonios, says : \"A voice of SOUK' one unseen spoke to him\"; and Pauaanias (ti, 39) of the same oracle says : \" Soaie-INTRODUCTION 5 times the suppliant has a vision, and at other times he hears something.\" -In P'iiATcl.''' Kleomenes, he says about the oraiMe of-Pasiphaai at Thalamai : \" A voice ame from the temple telling.\" And of Serapis, Arran {Anab. vii. 26) says: \" A voice came from the god.\" lamblichus, De Mysteriis (iii. 2), si>eakiDg of heaven\u00ad sent dreams, describes one of the sensations thus : \" Then a mysterious and incorporeal atmosphere surrounds them as they lie, such as does not touch their eyesight, but affects thiir other senses and sensibilities, murmuring in the entrance and penetrat\u00ad ing everywhere without touching anything, working wonderful works to rid them of suffering of soul and body.'' This atmosphere is mentioned by Plutarch, in De Genio Socratis, regarding Trophonios. \" He (Timarchoa) said he heard faintly a rushing noise aiming from above his head and causing a pleasant sound.\" A mystical light is often recorded as appearing to the sleepers. In Aristides' Orations many instances occur, Telesphoros (ii. 419.10) and Isis (ii. 424 16) both appear to him with shining lights. He sees the throne of Asklepios blazing with fire (ii. 438.25), and while he seems to be walking in the (-trwts of Athens, a bright light descends upon his bead\u2014an iucident which he takes as a portent of the future (ii. 466.2). Plutarch, De Gen. Soc. (22 p. 590), says \" Looking up he saw the earth nowhere, but islands shining vrith gentle fire.\" The god who appears to the dreamer, does so in an abrupt manner, and this is expressed in the word 6 IfJTRODDCnON iifilaTrurdaL. It is uscd of Asklcpios in the Epidaurcp.. Li:.,Rerapia the of A^wllo in OneirocrMca of Artemidoros, of Trophonios in the Vita Apoho)i:i lA Philosrratos, and of various other deities. The disposition of the god is felt to be kind and conciliatory. In an inscription of Epidauros (No 8) Asklepios is recorded to have smilingly jested De Is. ct Osir. {29}, says: \"If the name of Serapis is Egyptian, I think it must mean grace and kindness,\" The god is said to be of handsome and imposing appearance, and to be youthful. Asklcpios, according to an Epidaurian inscription (No. 25) appeared to a woman on the high-road in the form of a handsome man. Plutarch, in Sulla (17), says of Trophonios' \"They said he appeared like to Olympian Zeus in beauty and stature,\" An inscription of Epidauros (Ko 17) says: \"A young man of handsome appearance put a drug on his toe.\" Tacitus, in the Histories (iv. 83), states: \" The Egyptians relate that, in sleep, there appeared to King Ptolemy a young man of remarkable beauty, and supernatural form.\" Sweet odours emanate from tlie deities. Aristides (ii. 403) says : \" From the aegis (of Athena) came a very sweet odour,\" And of Protesilaus, Philostratos, Heroica (673, p. 141), says : \" Prom him there came an odour sweeter than autumnal myrtles.\" The gods disappeared suddenly, which is expressed in the words difiav^S ylyvtcrSai or atcoTctTttrQat. Incubation was a practice of great antiquity. Traces of its primitive beginnings are probably to be detected INTRODUCTION 7 in the description which Homer gives of the Selloi or Helioi, \" The prophets of Zeus of Dodona, who sleep on the ground and wash not the feet.\" But the earliest literary evidence of incubation as part of a cult ritual ia found in Aristophanes, who, in the Ploutos, describeB the temple-sleep in an Asklepieion. The temples of Asklepios were the chief centres of incubation, and we shall now proceed to consider in detail the practices therein. n. Incubation in the Cult of Asklepios EPIDAUROS ORIGIN AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE CULT OF ASKLEPIOS, \u2014Asklepios belongs to the Panhellenic, not to the Olympian, circle of deities. His cult was of compara\u00ad tively late origin, and came first into prominence in historical times. When Zeus was \" king of gods and men,\" Asklepios was no deity, merely a hero. In the epic of heroic times, he figures as a skilled physician. Homer mentions him as a pupil of Cheiron, and instructor of his two sons, Machaon and Podaleirios, who sailed to Troy from Thessaly. From the Eoiai and a Pythian Ode of Pindar, the oldest genealogy of Asklepios is deduced. His father was Apollo, his mother Koronis, daughter of Phlegyas, who dwelt in Thessaly. Asklepios was entrusted to Cheiron for his education. He proved so apt a pupil that not only did he work wonderful cures, but raised the dead to life again. This power brought on him the wrath of Zeus, and he was smitten by a thunder\u00ad bolt. Then came his apotheoais, and thereafter he took rank among the chthonian deities, as his most im\u00ad portant attribute, the serpent, testifies. But be was discinguished from the other chthonian gods in that he was honoured chielly, throughout historical times, as the divine physician. He received from his father, Apollo, this special province, the art of healing, which belonged to the chief god of divination. This tradition re[ircKc>TitR the close connection that existed between divination and the ancient art of medicine, and it is ErlDAUBOS 9 noteworthy that at Epidauros, Apollo Maleatos was worshipped along with Asklepios. Asklepios waa a wonder-worker, a saviour from troubles and diseases, and, owing to his timely efficaciousness, his euit grew great, so as to surpass all othei^ in the extent of its infiuence, during the first centuries of the Christian era. From the medical chthonian deity of the ancients, he became the al\u00ad mighty saviour and ruler of all, who is lauded in the Sacred Orations of .-Velius Anstul^'^, Thessaly was accepted as the cradle of the cult, and in The^aly Trilkka was the oldest centre, and enjoyed high renown both in ancient times, according to Strabo, and in the historical centimes, for mention of its fame ia found in Herondas, Pausanias, and in Isyllos, the poet of Epidauros. From Thessaly, the worehip of Asklepios spread into the Peloponnese, and through his amalgamation with original Peioponnesian divinities, there arose a new group of traditions as to his origin, according to which he was appropriated as a native of various parts of the Peloponnese, The Spidaunan legend given by Isyllos in the paean found during the excavations, makes Phlegyas a man of Epidauros, and that city the starting-point of the cult. The temples that were erected for the worship of Asklepios were scattered far and wide. Eoscher (p. 623) calculates that there were as many as three hundred and twenty, while Thraemer* gives evidence for one hundred and eighty-aix before the time of Alexander. It is believed that the sick were healed in nearly all of these temples, but three, in Panly-WisBowfl\u2014Jaifeptos, p. 1677. 10 INODBATION IN THE CULT OF ABKLEPIOS particular, were famous for their cures\u2014Trikka, Kos, and Epidauros. Pergamoa, too, in later times, was much frequented and rivalled Epidauros in popularity, but the latter always held the position of most distinctioQ as the ancient and favoured sanctuary of the god. THE TEISPLB AT EPIDAUROS.\u2014^The excavations which were begun at Epidauros in 1881 under the direction of M. Kavvadias, have brought to light not only the ruins of the buildings and the plan of the Temple, but many offerings with their dedications and some inscriptions. Thus we can judge both of the establishment and of the methods of treatment pursued therein, aa well as of many ritnal details. This gain of knowledge would be valuable in any case, but is all the more precious because literary descriptions of Epidauros are very scanty. The brief account given by Pausanias (ii. 27) is the fullest in any ancient writer. The whole Epidaurian territory was sacred to Asklepios, but his sanctuary was a considerable dis\u00ad tance from the city, about two and a half hours' journey. The Temple stands in a plain surrounded by bills, on one of which was the sanctuary of Apollo Miilcatos. From the inscriptions we team that the whole Temple was sacred to Apollo Maleatos and to Asklepios. It is not known whether Asklepios ousted any other god from this salubrious situation, or even whether the worship of Apollo was anterior to the worship of Asklepios there. All the evidence points to the supremacy of Asklepios, and the success of his heal\u00ad ing powers is seen in the rapid growth of the Temple, and in the magnificent buildings that have been ex-BPIDAOBOS 11 cavated. The Temple itself dates from the beginning of the fourth century B.C., and must have replaced an ancient structure, which had proved inadequate to the needs of the progressive cult. The worship of Asklepios is known to have been carried on at Epidauros from the beginning of the fifth centuiy, and from then, if not from earlier times, it was famous for its health-miracles and cures. At the present day the site of the Temple is attractive. Driving from the village of Ligourio, one loaches in a quarter of an hour the green little plain where the sacred precinct is. High hills, unusually well-wooded, circle round the plain, and promiuent on the hill-side to the south-east can be descried the theatre, the finest that Greece can boast. The road passes between the stadium and the Temple and goes on to the theatre. From the higher seats, half-way up the hill, one has a splendid view over the whole temple precinct. Straight in front is the Eatagogion, an immense square building, with four court-yards surrounded by little cells, numbering in all one hundred and forty. It was probably used as a caravanserai for the pilgrims at festival times, and belongs to the Roman period- To the left are the gymnasium and the baths, and farther to the north is the Temple itself, of which only the foundations remain. Behind it are the porticos, and to the left the Tholos. This is a circular building attributed to Polykleitos the younger. The purpose for which it was used is a debated question. One sees a maze of circular walls, with two concentric series of columns. The floor was paved with flagstones, and in the centre was a well or pit. Kavvadias^ believes that ^'lepov Tov 'Aa-KXtjirlov.\u2014See Q6X.0S. 12 INCUBATION IN THE CULT OP ABKLBPIOS it was used for rites and sacrifices connected with the ceremony of incubation. What these rites were ia unknown, but in one inscription they are mentioned as \"the usiiiil proceedings.\" The Tholos belongs to the fourth century, when building activity was greatest at Epidauros. To tin- same period are ascribed the temple, the ilnatre. and the porticos. The stadium was used as early as the fifth century. The Eirtond i>eriod of important additions to the Temple was under the Roman Emperors. During the last century of the Republic, the Temple bad suffered many depredations. Plundering raids were begun by Sulla, and it is seen from the excavations that buildings were destroyed as well as treasures stolen. But the former splendour was restored after the middle of the second century A.D. Pauaanias tells (ii. 27) how Antoninos, a member of the Roman Senate, effected restorations and built many new edifices. To him were owed the Baths of Asklepios and the Temple of the Epidotai, amongst other additions. It is open to doubt whether this Antoninos is the Roman Emperor, Antoninus Pius, who uas donor to many temples in Greece and Italy, From a computation of dates, made by Gurlitt in his work on Pausanias, it seems probable that the patron of Epidauros was a private Roman eitizeri of wealth, jMety. and a weak conatitufion, who had benefited by residence at the Temple. These restorations and additions were followed by others, and while the Temple wua restored after its former design, the additions were of the usture of modern improvements, which were necessitated by the hygienic regime prescribed for the patients. New reservoirs had to be constructed to give a nuisl plentiful EPIDAUBOB 13 water-supply, for baths were amongst the leading features. It is said that the best idea of the establish\u00ad ment at this later date can be got from a comparison with modern baths, such as Marienbad. THE INSCRIPTIONS OF CuRES.\u2014The tame of the Temple, its grandeur and magnitude, as well as its riches, were due to a deep-rooted faith in the healing powers of the god. This faith must have arisen from experience, and been tested by experience, and is in itself the best evidence that practical assistance was received at Epidauros by those who appealed to the god. The nature of this assistance, which has always been a problem to authorities on the origin of medicine, has been shown under a new light during these excavations, and in particular by the discovery of the stelae of inscriptions containing a list of cures. These tablets clearly belong to those mentioned by Strabo and Pausanias, for the contents correspond to the descriptions of these writers. Strabo, speaking of Epidauros, says (ii- 53) : \" The Temple is always full of patients and of stelae that have been set up with the cures inscribed on them, just as in Xos and Trikka,\" And Pausanias, also referring to Epidauros (ii. 27) ; \" Stelae have been erected within the precincts. In ancient times they were numerous, aud six were left in my time. On them were inscribed the names of men and women, cured by Asklepios, and also the diseases from which they suffered, and the method of cure. The writing was in the Doric language.\" And in ii. 36 Pausanias says: \" Hal ike is deserted in our time, but was inhabited once, and the word Halikos occurs in the 14 INCUBATION IN TIIK CULT OF ASKLEPIOS tablets of Epidauros, on which are inscribed the cures of Asklepios. I do not know any other writing worthy of note where there is mention of the city of Halikc or of the people of Halike.\" The place where these stelae were discovered is a building near the Temple of Asklepios and to the north of it. Eawadias* identifies this building as the Abaton, which is the name given in the inscriptions to the place where the suppliants lay down to sleep in expectation of a divine visitation. The foundations of its walls and pillars were discovered in the excavations of 1883, and it ia seen to have consisted of two long colonnades or porticos, closed on the north side by a wall, and open on the south, with an arcade of pillars. The first portico, which runs parallel to the Temple, is of one storey; the second, adjoining it and extending westwards, is of two storeys. Within the first colonnade at the east end has been found an ancient well, 55 feet deep, judged to be the sacred well of Asklepios, which figured so prominently in the cult. It was also within this same portico, and near the well, that were found the inscriptions we now have, and it can be seen from the bases of others which are still preserved in the original position that this was where the tablets, mentioned by Pausanias, had been erected. The second portico is not on a level with the first owing to the formation of the ground. The lower storey is in basement, while the upper floor adjoins the first portico. The basement was closed by a wall on ' Op. fif S:'' 'A/3arov. BPln.\\UROB 15 the south, had an entrance-door, and contained stone seats. The upper part was open on the south side with pillars and was divided into two parts length\u00ad wise. Probably the second portico was an extension of the first, and of later date, its construction being necessitated by the growing need for more accommo\u00ad dation. The only guide to the position of the Abaton is given by Pausanias (ii. 27) where he says: \" Beyond the Temple is the place where the suppliants sleep.\" The site of these two colonnades corresponds to his description, and, i n addition, Eawadias finds other reasons for the identification. He is of opinion that the inscriptions would be set up for public view in the place where the cures had been effected, and that the second well used in the treatment would be a necessary adjunct to the Abaton. Further, the colonnades bear a strong resemblance to a building in the Asklepieion at Athens, which also contains a sacred well, and which is believed by some to be the House of Incubation. The conclusion to which Kavvadias comes as to the identity of the Abaton has been disputed by Holwerda (Atken. ^fittheil., vol. 27), He points out that, pre\u00ad sumably from its name, the Abaton was a place of secured privacy, and, therefore, would be closed in all round. According to Pausanias, it was used as a dormitory, and in one inscription it is called the enkoimeterion, or dormitory. With reference to the discovery of the inscrijttions in the portico, he urges that they would more reasonably have been placed in a building for the reception of patients during the day, when the suppliants to the god 16 INCUBATEON IN THE CULT OF ASKLEPIOS would have time and light to be impressed with the divine wonders, than in the sleepmg-hall, which they entered at night-f^l!, and left at dawn. The well of sacred water would be used for cleansusg and purifying rites, but Holwerda submits that there is greater probability that these took place, not in the Abaton, but before the entrance of the patient therein. He refuses to take the resemblance to the Athenian building as a proof, for there is no documentary evi\u00ad dence as to the identity of the Athenian colonnades, and he expresses the belief that this building in the temple at Epidauros was used for the reception of patients during the day. In tiie inscription of Apellas, the phrase occurs: \"I must take a walk in the upper gallery.\" The only upper storey in the temple build\u00ad ings suitable for a walk is in these porticos. The Abaton has, then, still to be identified, and Holwerda finds it in the square building south-west of the temple which KavMidias describes as the priests' dwelling-house. It consists of a central court round which are small rooms, shut in so as to insure pri\\aey, and dates from the fourth century. In the north-west corner stands an ancient altar, which Kavvadias believes to hav<' belonged to the old temple. No conclusive proof of the identity of the Abaton can be given, but the existence of smiilor porticos in the same relation to the temples at Athens and Kos is a strong support to the view that the porticos were the scene of incubation. Leaving the question of the Abaton, we come to the inscriptions' found in the porticos. They are inscribed ' C.I.O. IV. B51-3. EPIDAUROS 17 on large atone stelae, and give forty-four cases of cure. The translation of the text is as follows ;\u2014 STELE I. God and Good Fortune. Cures of Apollo and Asklepios. 1. Eleo was with child for five years. After these five years of pregnancy, she came as a suppliant to the god and slept in the Abaton. As soon as she left it and got outside the temple precincts, she bore a son who, immediately after birth, washed himself at the fountain, and walked about with his mother. In return for this favour, she inscribed on her offering: \" Admire not the greatness of the tablet, but the divine power, in that Kleo was with child for five years, until she slept in the Temple and the god cured her,\" 2. A three-years' daughter. Ithmonike of Pellene came to the Temple to ask for offspring. She fell asleep and saw a vision. It seemed to her that she asked the god for a daughter, and Asklepios said that she would conceive, and that he would grant her any\u00ad thing else she asked. She answered that she had need of nothing else. But she remained with child for three years, until she returned to petition him about the birth. She fell asleep, and had a dream. She thought that the god asked her if she had not obtained from him all she had asked, since she was enceinte; she had added nothing about the birth, when he had inquired if she wished anything further, and had said he would grant her it too. But since now she had come to ask him the favour, he would accord it to her. Then she hastened to leave the Abaton, and gave birth to a man-child when she was outside the sacred precincts. 18 INCUBATION IN THE CULT OP ASKLEPIOS 3. A man, whose fingers, with the exception of one, were paralysed, came aa a suppliant to the Temple. While examining the temple tablets, he expressed incredulity regarding the cures and scoffed at the in\u00ad scriptions. In his sleep he saw the following vision. He thought that he was playing at dice near the Temple, and as he was going to cast the dice, the god suddenly appeared, seized his hand and stretched out his fingeiB. When the god stood aside from him, the patient thought he could bend his hand and stretch out all his fingers one by one. When be had stretched them all out, the god asked him if he would still be incredulous as to the contents of the inscriptions on the tablets. He answered that he would not, and the god said to him : \" Since formerly you did not believe in the cures, though they were not incredible, for the future your name will be ' The Unbeliever.' \" When day dawned, he left the sacred hall cured. \u00a9 Ambrosia of Athens, blind of one eye. She came as a suppliant to the god. As she went round the Temple, she laughed at sonic of the cures, thinking it incredible and impossible for the lame and the blind to be healed by merely seeing a vision. In tier sleep she had a dream. She thought that the god appeared to her, and said that he would cure her, but that in payment she must dedicate a silver pig to the Temple, as a memorial of her senaelessness, Aftei saying this, he cut the ball of the injured eye, and poured in some drug. When day came, she left the Temple cured. 5. A dumb boy came aa a auppliant to the Temple to recover his voice. When he had performed the preliminary sacrifices, and fulfilled the usual rites, the temple priest who bore the sacrificial fire, turned to BPIDArEOS 19 the boy's father and said : \" Do you promise to pay within a year the fees for the cure, if you obtain that for which you have come?\" Suddenly the boy answered, \" I do.\" His father was greatly astonished at this, and told his son to speak again. The boy repeated the words and so was cured, 6. Pandaros, a Thessalian, who had marks on his forehead. He saw a vision as he slept. He thought that the god bound the marks round with a head-band, and enjoined him to remove the band when he left the sacred ball, and dedicate it as an offering to the Temple. When day came, he awoke and took off the band. His face had been cleansed of the marks, and he dedicated to the Temple the band, to which the marks were transferred from his forehead, 7. EchedoTos received the marks of Pandaros in addition to those which he already had. He had received money from Pandaros to offer to the god at Epidauros in his name, but he failed to deliver it. In his sleep he saw a vision. He thought the god appeared to him, and asked if he had received any money from Pandaros to place as an offering in the Temple. He answered that he had received no such thing from him, but if he were healed, he was willing to offer to the god an image with an inscription. Thereupon the god fastened the head-band of Pandaros round his marks, and bade him take off the band when he left the Abaton, and wash his face at the fountain, looking at himself in the water. When day came, he lift the Abaton, took off the head-band, on which the marks were no longer visible, and saw his face with his own marks and those of Pandaros in addition. 20 ISCLBATIOK IN THE CULT OF ASKLEPIOS 8. Euphanes, a boy of Epidauros. While suffering from stone, be fell asleep. He thought that the god appeared and asked him : \" What will you give me if I cure you?\" \"Ten dice,\" be answered. The god laughed and said to him that he would cure him. When day came, he left the sacred hall cured, 9. A man who was so blind that, of one of his eyes he bad only the eyelids left, came as a suppliant to the god. Some of those in the Temple said it was folly to think that he could recover his sight, when one of bis eyes had not even a trace of the ball, and its socket was completely empty. As he slept, he saw a vision. It seemed to him that the god prepared some drug, then openiug his eyelids jxiured it into them. When day came, he departed with the sight of both 10. The Goblet. A porter was going up to the Temple conveying various utensils, aud he fell when he was about a mile distant from it. On getting up, he opened his bag, and saw that the vessels within had been broken. \\\\'he[i he realised that the goblet, from which his master was iitcustomed to drink, was also broken, he was in great distress, and sat down to try to fit t,he pieces together again. But a passer\u00ad by saw him and said: \"Foolish fellow, why waste your time repiecing a vessel which even Asklepios of Epidauros could not put to rights again?\" The other, hearing this, put the pieces back in the bag and went on to the Temple. When he got there, he opened the bag, and brought the goblet out of it. and it was entin'iy whole. He related these livings and doings to his master, who, on hearing them, dedicated the goblet to the god. EPIDAUROS 21 11. Aischines, while the patients were sleeping, climbed up a tree and tried to see over into the Abaton. But he fell from the tree on to some fencing, and his eyes were injured. In a pitiable state of blindness, he came as a suppliant to the god, and in his sleep was healed. 12. Euippos had had for six years the point of a spear in his cheek.

But Nikanor got up, pursued him, and so was cured. 22 INCUBATION IN THE CULT OF ASKLEPIOS (Ij) A man had his toe healed by a serpent. He was suffering dreadfully from a malignant sore in his toe, when the servants of the Temple took him outside and set him upon a seat. When sleep came upon him, a snake issued from the Abaton, and healed the toe with its tongue, and thereafter went back to the Abaton. When the patient woke up and saw that he was healed, he said that he had bad a dream that a beautiful youth had put a drug upon his toe. 18. Alketas of Halika. This blind man saw a vision.

Heraieus of Mytilene. He bad no hair on hia head, but an abundant growth on his cheeks. He was ashamed, because it made him the objoet of laughter. He fell asleep, and the god, by anointing his head witb some drug, succeeded in producing hair thereon. 20. Thyson of Hermion, a blind boy. While wide\u00ad awake, he had his eyes cured by one of the dogs in the Temple, aud went away healed. STELE II. 21. Arata, a woman of Lakedaimon, suffered from dropsy. She remained in Lakedaimon, while her mother went to sleep in the Temple and saw a vision. She thought that the god cut off her^daughter's head, aud hung up her body in such a way that her throat was turned downwards.

His blindness was cured by Asklepios. But because he did not send the fees for his treatment to the Temple, he was made blind again. So he came back to the Temple, and in his sleep was again healed. 23. Anstagora of Troizen. She had tape-worm, and while she slept in the Temple of Asklepios at Troizen, she saw a vision. She thought that, as the god was not present, but away in Epidauros, his sons cut off her head, but were unable to put it back again. Then they sent a messenger to Asklepios asking him to come to Troizen. Meanwhile day came, and the priest actually saw her head cut off from the body. The next night Aristagora had a dream. She thought the god came from Epidauros and fastened her head on to her neck. Then he cut open her belly, and stitched it up again. So she was cured. 24. Afislokritos, a boy of Halika, under a rock. He saved himself from shipwreck, and swam to dry land. The place was surrounded by rocks, and he was unable to leave it. Thereafter his father, after seeking in vain for him everywhere, had recourse to Asklepios on behalf of bis son, and slept in the Abaton, He had a dream. He thought that the god led him to a certain place, and showed bim that there was his son. He left the Abaton, quarried through the cliffs, and found h^ son, who had been there for seven days. 25. Sostrata, a woman of Pherai, was enceinte for a year. As she was in danger, she came to the Temple, carried on a litter, and slept there. But when she saw no clear vision, she went back home. 94 INCUBATION IN THE CULT OF ASKLEPIOS However, by the way, near a place called Komoi, she met a man of fine appearance, who, on inquiry, learned from her attendants their failures. He told them to set down on the ground the litter in which they were carrying Soatrata, and then he cut open the sick woman's abdomen, and brought out from it a great quantity of worms, enough to fill two diahes. Thereafter he stitched her up again, and so the woman was cured. He revealed to her that he was Asklepios, and enjoined her to send the fees for her treatment to Epidauros. 26.

A man had an abdominal abscess. He saw a vision, and thought that the god ordered the slaves who accompanied him to lift him up and hold him, so that his abdomen could be cut open. The man tried to get away, but his slaves caught him and bound him. So Asklepios cut him open, rid him of the abscess, and then stitched him up again, releaaiog him from his bonds. Straightway he departed cured, and the floor of the Abaton was covered with blood. 28. Kleinates of Thebes and the Hee. He had lioe on his body in great numbers.

As he was walking about in a waking state, one of the geese in the Temple bit his feet, making them bleed, and so he was cured. According to the orthography and the form of the letters, thrae inscriptions cannot be anterior to the middle of the fourth century B.C., nor posterior to the third century B.C. But it must not be 28 INCrBATION IS THE CULT OF ASKLEPIOS inferred that they all relate to contemporary practice. On the contrary, it is probable that the great majority of cases date much farther back than the time of their inscription on the tablets. The case of Aristagora (No. 23) is a proof of this, for her story is related by Hippys of Rhegion, a historian who wrote during the Persian wars. Also the anonymity, which is characteristic of so many of the cases, con\u00ad firms this view. If particulars of identity had been obtainable, the beneficiaries would not be described as \"a man,\" or \"a woman\"; such vagueness was undesirable in view of the fact that these cures were to serve the purpose of strengthening faith in the god. Other cases, again, may belong to the time when they were inscribed. For example, in No. 28, the article is used before the name Kleinates, which ^ows that it deals with an individual known at the time. In all probability these inscriptions were compiled by the priests, who could draw the subject-matter from the traditions of the Temple, and from offerings deposited by grateful patients, on some of which there would be inscriptions giving the facts, as in case No. 1. Thus the cures might range from oldest traditions to the most recent achievements of the fourth century B.C. The date of the inscriptions ia the same as that of the colonnade in which they were found, and this coincidence leads to the belief that the compilation was considered as an opportune addition to the new build\u00ad ing, and was carried out by the temple ofBcials to spread abroad the fame of the cult, and to increase faith in the god's healing |x>wers. iNfiTuvnoN AS EBPRKSKNTUD IN THE INSCRIPTIONS.\u2014 A certam uniformity is characteristic of these in-EPIDAUROS 29 scriptions. The act of incubation, which the suppliant performs, and the divine response to it present similar featiu-es in almost all the cases. The patient, seeking the god's help in his trouble, lies down to rest in the appointed hall, and during the n^ht there comes to him a visitation from the god. In the majority of cases, the god appears in person, and by some simple act, or surgical operation, effects the cure. Nest morning the patient leaves the Abaton sound in life and limb, content to have fulfilled the purpose of his visit to the Temple. The variety of troubles, ailments, and disablements in the inscrip\u00ad tions that remain to us, is great. A large proportion of them eonaists of what are called incurable diseases. Cases of blindness are of most frequent occurrence, and the eyesight is restored by the applica\u00ad tion of some ointment, or by the mere touch of the god's hand. Paralytics and lame men regain their powers by some similar simple act, while abseeraes and other serious internal disorders are set right by divine surgery. But amongst the cases marked by this uniformity of system, there occur a few of singular characteristit^. The uniqueness of the experience of Aristagora (No, 23) gives the story a fabulous air, and it should probably be considered as a tradition of the Asklepios cult, arising from the rivalry between the two temples of Troizen and Epidauros. No. 25 also is peculiar. The cure is not effected at the Temple during incubation. After spending a fruit\u00ad less night in the Abaton, Sostrata was returning home, when she was accosted by a man of fine presence, who performed an operation there and then, and cured her. 30 INCUBATION IN THE CULT OF ASKLEPIOS The only other case of a cure performed away from the Temple is No. 21, when the mother, leaving her daughter ill at home, goes to the Temple, and in a vision sees her being treated for dropsy. On her return, she finds that her daughter is restored to health, and that she had seen a similar vision. One of the inscriptions (No. 10) deals not with a human patient, but with a broken vessel, which is made whole again, and No. 7, instead of relating a cure, tells of a punishment inflicted for seeking to defraud the god. The gift of prophecy which belonged to Asklepios is recorded in No. 24. A man who has lost bis son is directed by the god, during incubation, to the place where he should find his son- Prophetic activity ranks far behind the healing powers of Asklepios as a source of his renown; nevertheless the two functions were closely connected in him as in the other chthonian deities, and it is noteworthy that one of these inscrip\u00ad tions records an instance of a prophetic oracle. In four of the cases, the god did his work by proxy, his agents being some of the sacred animals maintained in the Temple. Two patients, while in a waking state, were cured by temple dogs, and other two by a ser\u00ad pent. At Epidauros, both dogs and serpents were considered sacred to Asklepios and kept in the Temple, Dogs were kept also in the Asklepieion at Athena, at Rome, and at Lebene in Crete, and according to an inscription, dogs were fed on sacrificial cakes at the Temple of Asklepios at the Piraeus. The serpent was the special symbol of the god, and as auch was a fitting representative for him in the work of healing. A peculiar kind of harmless yellow snake was found at Epidauros, and it was adopted as an attribute of EPIDAUROS 31 the cult. In founding colonies for the worship of Asklepios, one of these serpents was sometimes sent as a representative of the god; for instance, at the foundation of the Temples of Kos, Rome, and Epidauros Limera. The process which the suppliant to Asklepios had to carry out is stated with marked simplicity in these inscriptions, but it cannot be doubted that it was costly to the patients and was accompanied by rites and sacrifices. No. 5 is the only case where there is mention of these ceremonies, but judging by the temple buildings and the number of priests and ser\u00ad vants, we can obtain some idea of their complexity. The usual ceremonies mentioned in No. 5 probably con\u00ad sisted of preparation by the priest through instruction, rites, and sacrifices, all calculated to increase the suppliant's faith, and dispose him to be in an impres\u00ad sionable frame of mind, before incubation. To the particular sacrifices we have no direct cine. At Trikka, it is related in Isylloa, the suppliant sacrificed to Apollo before entering the sacred sleeping-hall, and it is prob\u00ad able that at Epidauros, too, Apollo was approached in worship. When the preliminaries were over, and the suppliant's wish had been granted, he had to pay for the gift of health. The iatra, or doctor's fees, required to be disbursed, and they were stringently exacted. Seven of these inscriptions mention them, and Asklepios himself deigned to impress upon his patients that they must be paid. Punishment was inflicted on those who sought to evade payment. Two instances are given of blind men, whose sight had been restored, but was lost again, owing to failure in this resj^ct; they recovered it only when they satisfactorily paid 32 INCUBATION IN THB CULT OF ASKLEPIOS the full dues. In another case, before the work of healing was done, a promise was exacted that payment would be forthcoming. Probably there was no fixed sum. A distinction would be made between rich and poor patients. It is recorded that a boy was allowed by the god to escape payment altogether. A similar distinetion was made in the thank- offerings dedicated to the god. In some cas^ these were suggested or demanded by Asklepios in the vision, aa in No. 4, when Ambrosia was ordered to dedicate a silver pig. The offering was usually made according to the suggestion of the priests, who would advise it as a means of winning the god's favour or of showing gratitude for benefits received. The Temple was full of these votive offerings, which date from the beginning of the fifth century B.C. They varied from humble earthenware vessels to the most valuable treasures, and even some of the temple buildings were erected as thank-offerings, as, for example, the Baths of Antoninus. The extent and magnificence of the Temple tell of a plentiful revenue, accruing from earliest times, and no small part of this revenue was drawn from health-miracles. Pausanias (x. 38) tells of one, Phalysios of Naupaktos, who through gratitude for eyesight restored, gave two thousand gold stateiB (\u00a31900) to the Temple of Asklepios. It is, then, clear that at the Temple benefits were bestowed on men, for which they were willing to pay handsomely. But the manner in which these benefits were conferred is a matter of dispute. The inscriptions relate briefiy and simply divine miracles. The patient, after the preliminaries were ended, betook himself to the sleeping-hall, and there was passive in the hands BPIDAUHOS 33 of the god, who appeared in person and wrought the work of healing. This description of the works of Asklepios is found only in these inscriptions, but they are strongly supported in the Ploutos of Aristophanes, which gives a true, satirical picture of the practice of incubation at the beginning of the fourth century B.C, Ploutos, the god of riches, has been deprived of his sight by Zeus, so that he could not distinguish between the just and unjust, and during incubation his sight is restored by Asklepios, The following passage narrates hia experiences at the Asklepieion, either in Athens, or at the Piraeus (v. 634) :\u2014 \" Karion\u2014As soon as we approached the god with him who then was the most miserable of men, but now blessed and happy above all, first we took him to the water and then gave him a bath. Wife of Chremylos\u2014Truly he was fortunate\u2014an old man bathed in the chilly water. K.\u2014^Then we went to the precinct of the god. When our wafers were laid on the altar, the preparatory sacrifices made, and our cake in the flame of Hepbaistos, we laid Ploutos down on a couch, as was right, and we all put straight our matt!e^ses. IV.\u2014Were many others seeking the aid of the god? K.\u2014Yes, one Neokleides, who is blind, but surpasses in stealing men who can see; and many others suffer\u00ad ing from all sorts of diseases, WTien the servant of the god put out the lamps, and told us to go to sleep and keep silent if we heard a noise, all of us lay down quietly. I was unable to sleep, for I was distracted by a pot of porridge which stood a little way off from the head of an old woman. 34 INCUBATION IN THE CULT OF ASKLEPIOS and I longed to creep up to it. Then looking up, I saw the priest carrying off the cake and figs from the sacred table. Thereafter he went round all the altars in turn to see if any cake was left behind. Then he consecrated them into a bag. I, thinking there was great piety in the proceeding, got up and went for the pot of porridge. W.\u2014Didst thou not fear the god, audacious man? K.\u2014Ay, indeed I feared him, leet he should get to the porridge-pot before me, with his chaplets. His priest it was who showed us bow,\" Then Karion describes how the god appeared with bis daughters, laso and Panakeia. \" K.\u2014Straightway I covered myself for fear, and he went round examining carefully the ailment'; in turn. Then a boy brought him a stone mortar and pestle and a medicine chest. 11^,\u2014Of stone? K.\u2014No, not covered up, K.\u2014Through my cloak, which had, in truth, not a few holes. Firat of all he began to pound the ointment for Neokleides, putting in three heads of Tenian garlic. Then he crushed them in the mortar and mixed them with fig-juice and squills. Then he sprinkled on Sphettian vinegar, and anointed his eyelids, turning them up, BO that the pain was greater. Neokleides, screaming and crying, tried to rush away, but the god laughed and said ; ' There now, sit plastered over, so that I may keep you from going and perjuring your\u00ad self at the Assembly.' l\"^-\u2014How patriotic the god is, and how clever! ff-\u2014Thereafter he sat down by Ploutos, and first touched his head; then took a clean towel and wiped his eyelids. Panakeia wrapped his head and all his face in a purple cloth. Then the god whistled, and two serpents, of prodigious size, rushed out from the Temple. W.\u20140, ye friendly gods! A'.^And these two crept gently under the purple doth and licked his eyelids round about, it seemed to me. And before you could drink ten measures of wine, lady, Ploutos stood up a seeing man. I clapped my hands for joy, and wakened my master. The god at once disappeared and the snakes with him into the Temple. Those who were lying near Ploutos began to con\u00ad gratulate him, you may imagine, and they kept awake the whole night tiU day dawned. And I praised the god very highly that he had speedily made Ploutos to see and Neokleides more blind than ever.\" The story of Karion confirms the Epidaurian inscrip\u00ad tions. Ploutos goes through preliminary ritea and ceremonies, and at night sleeps in the Temple. Then a nocturnal visit is paid by the god, and by the divine touch, with the assistance of two sacred serpents, the patient recovers his sight. Evidently the reputation which Asklepios enjoyed as a worker of miracles, and which is made known in the inscriptions, was so well established as to be a subject for popular satirical comedy at Athens. We thus know that the cures were declared to be miracles, but we do not know to what extent they were miracu-36 INCUBATION IN THE CULT OF ASKLEPIOS loua, or what was their connection with the art of medicine. To judge from the Epidaurian inscriptions and from Aristophanes, the medical art was not practised at the Temple. The god wrought miraclC'^ of healing, and the Temple had need only of priests and servants for the accompanying rites. Of these priests we find mention in many of the temple inscriptions. There were the chief prie.st, and a second one, called the Fire- bearer, of almost equal rank, and the third was a temple-servant, the iiakoros or Nakoros. But apart from these ministers of the cult, would there not be a staff of skilled physicians and sui^eons, who were willing to play the part of the divine visitor? M. Kavvadias* takes the view that the medical art was not practised during the first few centuries of the Temple's prosperity. These inscriptions, in hia opinion, along with the confirmation of the Ploutos, convey to us the method of treatment. He asserts that divine miracles were wrought, miracles such as have occurred at viuious times in men's experience, and such as do occur at Lourdes and in certain Christian churohes. He quotes recent instances of temple miracles at Athens and the Piraeus, where two paralysed girls were cured in visions which came to them during sleep in the churches. Further, he rejeets the idea that a comedy was played during incubation, in which a human physician took the part of the god. This might have been carried on by the priests to increase faith and reverence, if the cases treated had been oi-dinary complaints, but in view of the fact that they are iiio.-;tly ' incurable' ' Op. eft., oh. IV.' EPID.4UR0S 37 diseases, such as blindness and paralysis, it would be impossible to maintain that opinion. This view of the question is opposed by Tbraemer,' He considers that these inscriptions are not to be taken as statements of the method of contemporary practice. It is impossible to identify the beneficiaries, and the cases should be regarded rather as pious legends, in the same category as the mythological cures of Asklepios, found in Pindar and other writers. The inscriptions would be erected for the edification of the patients, but the treatment they themselves received would be on different lines. He holds that the art of medicine was practised in the temples of Asklepios from the earlieat times, and that the methods of later centuries were merely a develop\u00ad ment of the original treatment, and not a complete transformation, as Kavvadias maintains. As evidence for bis argument, he takes the frag\u00ad mentary inscription (C. 1. G. Vol. IV. 954) found at Epidauros and belonging to the third or second century B.C. It was inscribed on a votive offering, and is as follows:\u2014 \" For before coming into thy hands and into those of thy children, O Asklepios, I was prostrate under a baleful dise^e, with chest trouble and no power in my hands. But thou, 0 healer, didst persuade me to raise this offering and so live free from disease.\" The fact of the offering being made before the cure shows, for Tbraemer, that the day of miracles was past, and as confirmation of this, he takes the passage in the Gurculio of Plautus, where Cappadox, being in ' INCUBATION IN THE CDLT OF ASKLEPIOS ill-health, spends a night in the Temple of Asklepios. The passage is as follows :\u2014 Cappadox comes out of the Temple, after a night of incubation, and says (v. 216) : \" I am determined to depart now from this Temple, since I see it is the resolve of .^sculapius to do nothing for me and to refuse me healing. My health is waning, my affliction waxing greater.\" After convereation on his symptoms he asks Palinurus : \" Could you make a guess if I were to tell you what I dreamt in my sleep last night? Palinurus\u2014Oh, I am the only man learntd in divination. Why, the interpreter asks me for advice, and all keep by the answer I give them.\" After further talk the dream is told. \" Cappadox\u2014Last night I seemed to see in my sleep Aesculapius seated far away from us. He did not come near me, nor seem to set any value upon me.\" Palinurus advises him thus: \" Make peace with Aesculapius lest a great eril should befall you, aa has been [wrtended in your sleep.\" The Greek play, from which Plautus derived the Curculio, was wi'itten soon alter 303 B.C, and thus the style of incubation would be representa\u00ad tive of the beginning of the third century B.C. Tbraemer interprets the passage as implying that suppliants to the god did not expect from temple-sleep a supernatural healing but divine counsel. His interpretation can be disputed, for all Cippadox says is that the god did not approach him, or take notice of him. We are not told what would have happened if he had been successful in obtaining divine aid, It is just as possible that Cappadox was expecting a miracle to be wrought, as advice to be given. The evidence for this period of incubation is very scanty, and no absolute conclusions can be drawn from It. Fragments of two more of Pausanias' stelae (C. /. G. IV. 953, 953a) have been found at Epidauros, but they convey no new information. The inscrip\u00ad tions are to the effect (1) that Alexander of Crete being cured, contributed a mina of silver to the Temple of Asklepios; (2) that a man, blind of one eye, being cured, contributed money to the treasury of Asklepios. The third stele, which is of a different thickness, records the case of a woman, and in it incubation is mentioned, but the particulars cannot be deciphered. A fourth stele of inscriptions has been recently dis\u00ad covered, and in 1903 was published by M. Kavvadias.' It was not found in the Abaton as the other columns were, but near the Propylaea of tlie Temple. It seems to have been used aa the threshold of a doorway, and was probably trans\u00ad ported from the Abaton in the Middle Ages. It is in a very imperfect state, broken in two, and only legible towards the end, but its dimensions and the form of the letters are the same as those of the first two stelae. It certainly contained a long list of cures by Asklepios, similar to those of the other columns. Towards the end we can read of a certain Heraklcitos of Chios, who came to the Temple, and slept and saw a dream. The rest ia indecipherable. Also one Pamphanis of Epidauros had a cankerous sore in ' MSanga dos malady 40 INCUBATION IN THE CULT OF ASKLEPIOS his mouth- He slept and had a vision. It seemed to him that the god opened his mouth . . and cleaned out his mouth. Prom this he became well. These fragments that are legible show that this stele also did not relate cures w rought by medical treatment. It was still a question of divine miracles. INCUBATION IN ROMAN TIMES.\u2014The doubt which exists as to methods of treatment in the early period of the Temple's activity disappears as we approach Rinnan times. Both from epigraphic and literary evidence we can form a clear idea of incubation as practised in these later days. One of the fullest accounts is given in the inscription of M. Juhus Apellas, found at Epidauros. It dates from the second century A,D. , and the text is as follows (C. I. G. IV, 955) :\u2014 \" Cure of M. Julius Apellas; inscribed in second half of 2nd century, A.D., by himself, at Epidauros. In the priesthood Apellas of Idrias and Mylasa, was sent for by the god, for I was a chronic invaUd and suffered from dyspepsia. In the course of my journey the god told me in Aigina not to be so irritable. When I reached the Temple, he directed me to keep my head covered for two days; and for these two days it rained. I was to eat bread and cheese, parsley with lettuce, to wash myself without help, to practise running, to drink citron-lemonade, to rub my body on the sides of the bath in the bath-room, to take walks in the upper portico, to use the trapeze, to rub myself over with sand, to go with bare feet in the bath-room, to pour wine into the hot water before I got in, to wash EPIDAUROS 41 myself without help, and to give an Attic drachma to the bath-attendant, to offer in public sacrifices to Asklepios, Epione, and the Eleusinian goddesses, and to take milk with honey. When for one day I had drunk milk alone, the god aaid to put honey in the milk to make it digeetible. When I called upon the god to cure me more quickly, I thought it was as if I had anointed my whole body with mustard and salt, and had come out of the sacred hall and gone in the direction of the bath-house, while a small child was going before holding a smoking censer. The priest said to me: ' Xow you are cured, but you must pay up the fees for your treatment.' I acted according to the vision, and when I rubbed myself with salt and moistened mustard, I felt the pain still, but when I had bathed, I suffered no longer. These events took place in the tirst nine days after I had come to the Temple. The god also touched my right hand and my breast. The following day as I was offering sacrifice, a fiame leapt up and caught my hand, so as to cause blisters, Tet after a little my hand was healed. As I prolonged my stay in the Temple, the god told me to use dill along with olive-oil for my headaches. Formerly I had not suffered from headaches, but my studies had brought on congestion. After I used the ohve-oil, I was cured of headaches. For swollen glands, the god told me to i^e a cold gargle, when I consulted him about it, and he ordered the same treat\u00ad ment for inflamed tonsils. He bade me inscribe this treatment, and I left the Temple in good health and full of gratitude to the 42 INCUBATION IN THB CULT OP ASKLEPIOS In the above inscription the later method of incuba\u00ad tion is detailed. It is maintained by Thraemer that this is the only method, and that it was merely an extension and development of the primitive treatment. Kavvadias, on the other hand, dibtiiigujshes two separate periods in the cult at Epidauros. The ancient inscriptions he takes as relating the early methods, which were rendered impossible by the rapid growth of scepticism. People refused to believe any longer in mu'acles, and as faith is the first essential for the suc\u00ad cess of the supernatural, new methods had to be devised, if the Temple was to be supported by popular favour as in times past. The work of healing had now to be carried on by medical science and hygienic treatment, while, for evident reasons, the cult bad to be preserved. Thus we find a com\u00ad bination of therapeutics and religious worship. The treatment is still by temple-sleep, but now the god does not save by personal action. He points out the way to salvation. Dreams were sent and tokens given to the suppliant, and an interpretation of these had to be made. According to the interpretation the patient pursued what seems to have been in many cases a long and tedious process of cure. The simplicity and reassuring certainty of the ancient inscriptions have disappeared, and instead of all being righted by the laying-on of a healing hand, the patient had to follow out carefully a couree of treatment and submit to a strict regime. The usual measures prescribed were hot and cold baths, all sorts of bodily uiid {jyiniiastie exercises, dietary regulations, frequent bUH'ding, and the application of drugs and ointments. Such treatment necessitated lengthy residence at the EPIDAUROS 43 Temple, so that it became a kind of hydropathic whither crowds flocked in search of health. To the success of the treatment, which in itself was hygienic, the healthy situation of the Temple, and the health- giving \\\\aterd of the sacred well would largely contribute. The infiuence of the priesthood was in these later times of the greatest weight. Practically everything lay in their hands, for their interpretation of the dreams was necessarily accepted as a divine inspiration. They also had it in their power to act on the patient's mind, so that certain dreams came to him, and according to Aelius Aristides, they sometimes asserted that they themselves had received a dream for a certain supphant which he must act upon. This ia a phase of incubation which is dealt witb in connection with the Plutonia. The Sacred Orations of Aristides give a graphic picture, with profuse details, of the existence of thoae who sought health at these resorts. He narrates his own experiences, and although bis must have been an exceptional case in respect of duration, he would necessarily follow the ordinary methods of incubation. There is a striking parallelism between parts of his narrative and the inscription of Apellas. The cases were of the same hysterical, dyspeptic nature, and the same methods were pursued. Aristides visited many different temples of Asklepios, where the practices were on similar lines to those of Epidauros. The details of his experiences and the treatment to which he submitted will be seen from the following resume of hi'^ Sacred Orations. nL Incubation in the Cult of AND METHOD OF WRITING.\u2014The Sacred Orations were writlen several years after Aristides' recovery from his long illness, which lasted 17 ycara and is calculated to have begun in 144 A.D. He survived the earthquake of 180 A.D,, and is supposed to have died about 185 A.D. In four passages of the Orations, he mentions that he writes at an indefinite number of years after the cures, and it is supposed that be did so in 175, in the consulship of Salvius Julianue, \u00a7316. ' So long after, I cannot give details.\" \u00a7319. \" What I did with the geese, I do not know after the lapse of so many years.\" \u00a7324. \"I cannot give the true sequence of the dreams after the lapse of so many yeare.\" \u00a7291. \" Now after so many years, and so long a time, visions in dreams foree me to put these mattera before the world,\" This lapse of time would account for his obscurity on many points, and for his disconnected narrative. Only for a few paragraphs of his first Oration does he give a continuous nequeiice of treatment as he carried it out day by day, Ho ilevotew more space to what he calls the wonderful parts of hia experience, for the details of which he can refer to bis notes. For, from the very beginning of bis illness, the god had urged him to record the details. At Pergamtw ig324) the god urged him to write, saying : \" It is fitting for you to discourse like Socrates, Thucydides, and Demosthenes,\" And ABISTIDES' ORATIONS 45 \u00a7291; \"This was the first of Asklepios' injunctions. And I recorded the dreams, dictatmg when I was unable to write myself.\" The vision of \u00a7361 was thus dictated, so that the detaila are esact, according to his notes. \u00a7292: \"Ail that happened at Pergamos no man could relate, but if anyone wishes to know the details of our dealings with the god, he must consult my notes and the record of the dreama. He will find there cures of all kinds, conversations, speeches at length, all sorts of visions, prophecies and oracles about all sorts of things, some in prose and others in verse, and an unimaginable number of things calling for gratitude to the god,\" But many of these notes had been lost during the years of his restless travt^! (\u00a7291), and in the first year of illness he had b^n too weak to think of recording. BEGINNING AND GENERAL CHARACTER OF ILLNESS.\u2014 He began to suffer on hia journey to Rome. Travelling in winter-time he caught a chill at the firat. At the Hellespont he suffered from earache, and a storm causing diSicultiea of transport with ensuing hardships, brought on fever, asthma, and toothache. Arrived in Rome he had severe internal sufferings, shivering fits, and want of breath. Treatment by Roman doctors only aggravated his sufferings, and he determined to return home by sea. A stormy voyage n^e him worse. When at last he arrived in Smyrna, which hereafter was his headquarters, the doctors and \" gymnasts \" gathered round him, and were astonished at the varied nature of the disease\u2014r^v jrotKsAiav T^S voa-ov. They could do nothing but send him to the hot baths between Smyrna and Klazomenai. Here it was that Asklepios, the saviour, first began to make revelations 46 INCUBATION IN THE CULT OF ASKLEPIOS to him. The first order was to go with bare feet in the severe wintry weather. At this time the wDr^t of his troubles was want of breath, \u00a7292, and choking in the throat, and his nerves were also upset. Indigestion was his constant enemy, accompanied by fever, sleeplessness, and excessive perspiration. He was affiicted also with numberless complications, \u00a7303. He gives a detailed account of his symptoms, when he was sure he was on the point of death. Toothache and earache continued to trouble him from time to time, and he seems also to have suffered from rheumatism and lumbago, \u00a7357, being unable to endure movement. \u00a7313 gives a detailed account of what seems to be a kind of fit, or convulsion, of the body. According to Sopater, be was an epileptic. TREATMENT AT PEHI;AMOS\u2014BATHS, ETC.\u2014.\\fter a year and some months at Smyrna, Asklepios sent him to Pergamos. On the first night there, \u00a7293, the god appeared to Aristides\" attendant under the form of Salbios, a visitor to the Temple, spoke to him about Aristides' writings, and called them Sacred Orations. Then be gave prescriptions for Aristides' cure\u2014such as balsam-juice to be used on leaving a hot bath for a cold one, and soap, a mixture of raisins and other ingredients, also other prescriptions, which Aristides omits in order to come to the wonders of his cure. He stayed in a g.tte-houae of a priest at the Temple, washed in the sacred well, and anointed in the open- nir, all according to the command of the god. He says he would soon have been restored to health, had he ARISTIDES ORATIONS 47 not yielded to the advice of friends and followed their counsels instead of those of Asklepios. Then all went wrong. But when he kept to the ordere of Asklepios all was right. His health was bad about the time of the winter-equinox. It was a stormy day. The god ordered him to rub himself over with mud and wash in the well. That night he was told to wrap himself over witb mud, etc., and run three times round the Temple. It was a north wind and keen frost. He did as Asklepios ordered, then bathed at the well, and found himself in fine condition. But a companion who imitated him had a paralytic spasm, and could scarcely be restored to heat. Another day of winter, he had to cover himself with mud and sit in the temple-hall of Zeus, Another time, he was told to rise from a bed of fever, and clad only in a linen garment, go out and wash in the well. He felt no cold, though the water was icy. The astonish\u00ad ment of the spectators at these baths was very great. Therefore, surely .\\ristides' was an unusual course of treatment. River-bathing was ordered from the first, \u00a7301. He was confined to bed, in the priest's house, with fever and stomach troubles and countless complications. Asklepios ordered bleeding to the amount of 120 litres, which .Aristides interpreted as meaning a large quantity, for all the priests agreed that they had never heard of such an amount. When this bleeding was proceeding, the god ordered a bath in the Kaikos. He rose, took off his woollen wraps, and walked to bathe. The bath gave him an indescribable relief. These cold baths in rigorous weather with a north wind blowing, are a common prescription. He men-48 INCUB\\TION IN THE CULT OF ABKLEPIOB tions one at Smyrna, and a third at Pergamos, when he had long been too weak to leave the house. A crowd of friends looked on with astonishment. The pleasant\u00ad ness of the water was marvellous, for it was a stormy day. After the bath, a delightful heat pervaded his body (\u00a7295). Another time at Smyrna, he was sent to bathe in the river. It was the depth of winter, and extra hard wintry weather. A doctor prophesied paralysis for him if he bathed. But \" full of heat from the sight of the god,\" he jumped in at the deepest part and had an agreeable bath. The onlookers cned out the praise of Asklepios. Aristides was renewed in health and vigour by this bath, and often repeated the treatment. \u00a7323. A bath in sand was ordered, and he cheerfully complied. \u00a7367. A cold bath was given as a cure for rheumatism. It was cold autumn weather and he was unable to move. In a dream he rcceived a message to run ton stades and take a cold bath at the end. He ran the ten atadcs, against a stormy north wind, had an enjoyable bath in the river, and for a few months after enjoyed good health. As great a \"Paradox\" was the journey ordered (\u00a7349) at a time when he was greatly troubled with his throat. The doctors had advised the greatest care and gargling. The god made him do a long journey with sand and dust blowing in his face and irritating his throat. At the end he sacri\u00ad ficed to Zeus Olympics in the Temple at his paternal home, and found himself much better in health. Horse-oxerciso was also ordered by a dream which he had while staying at his native city of Hadriani. He was in a weak state of body, exhausted by digestive troubles. His dream was that he was alone on a raft ARISTIDES' ORATIONS 49 in the Egyptian Sea, and Zosimos, his attendant, appeared to him in hia difficulties, with a horse on land. Aristides got to land somehow, and mounted the horse. Then he found himself in the schools of Alexan\u00ad dria, and was delighted to hear children reciting verses which he had composed in honour of the god. The interpretation of this dream was that he went in for riding on horseback and benefited greatly thereby. \u00a7314. Once at hia father's house at Hadriani, he was alarmingly ill with high fever and severe pain. The doctors could do nothing. He fell asleep and had a dream that he must visit the house of his foster- parents. He arose, mounted a horse, and rode there and back, about a stade. On his return, his ailments had disappeared. PROPHETIC VISIONS.\u2014\u00a7294. At Smyrna, Aristides received a prophecy from the god as to the duration of his illness. Asklepios appeared to him along with the Klarian Apollo, called Kalliteknos, of Pergamos,. and reckoning on his fingers said, \" ' Thou shalt have ten years from me, and three from Serapis,' and by the placing of his fingers the thirteen seemed to be seventeen.\" This vision took place in the fourth year of illness; hence the number seventeen. References to this prophecy are found in three passages of the Sacred Orations, and in his Eulogy to Asklepios, \u00a738, he says: \" To some people the god even foretells times and seasons. And this we ourselves know.\" This prophecy of the duration of his illness is one of the few cases of waking vision. The god himself says, \"This is not a dream (6vap) but a waking vision 50 INCUBATION IN THB CULT OF ASKLEPIOS \\nrap ).\" Occasionally he mentions the fact of sleep. Thus, \u00a7349, he was unable to sleep for dyspepsia, but during the day, he says, just enough sleep was granted him to conceive what he did conceive, namely, the dream that he proceeds to relate. \u00a7298. He describes the sensations which a visita\u00ad tion of the god produces. \" In this way the absinth was revealed in the most evident manner, and like countless other things, told of the presence of the god. It was as if one thought he could touch and see him when he came; aa if one were between sleeping and waking, and wished to behold him, and were afraid he would depart before; as if one were all attention and were listening, sometimes in a dream, sometimes in a.' waking vision; as if one's hair were standing on end, and as if one were shedding tears of joy and felt light-hearted;\u2014but what man could describe this state? Those who are initiated can understand and sympathise.\" \u00a7274. He distinguishes between waking visions and sleeping. \" Each of our days, as each of our nights, has its story, if anyone were willing to recount the events or tell of the providence of the god, how he sometimes made revelations openly in his own person, and at other times in messages conveyed by dreams, when it was possible for me to find sleep.\" \u00a7333. He expresses the idea that abstraction is necessary for converse with the god. \" Once I heard the following opinion given as to divine converse and intercourse. He said that the mind must be removed from the actual circumstances, and if that were done, it could consort with the god, and by this intercourse would soar above the human state. In this there is .ARISTIDES' OR.ATIONS 51 nothing marvellous, neither the fact that superiority produces intercourse with the god, nor that intercourse produces superiority.\" One instance wherc the god seems to hiive appeareii to him in bodily form is \u00a7289, also a prophetic vision. Zosimos, his attendant, was at a distance from him and feit ill. Aristides himself was in the greatest extremity, and each was more distressed at the other's illness than at his own, \" The god appeared to me and I took hold of his head with one hand after another, begging him to save Zosimos. The god refused. Again taking hold of him in the same way, I begged him to consent. But he refused. A third time I took hold of him and tried to persuade him to consent. He neither refused nor agreed, hut kept his head bent neither one way nor the other, and said to me words which are applicable in such cases. I remember them, but think it unnecessary to set them forth. After saying these things, he consented to give his help. One of the things he said was, ' Take care!' The sequel to this vision was that Zosimos recovered unexpectedly from that illness. According to what the god had told me, he had used barley and lentils as medicine. He lived four months longer.\" The s^ond sequel was the death of Zosimos, \u00a7317. A prophecy had been given to Zosimos that he would live as long as the cow lived in the field. This was interpreted to mean, he must not eat beef. At the time of his death it was said he had sacrificed a heifer, and that this had been fatal to him, along with the chill which caused his death, \u00a7290. He had gone off to visit and care for a sick friend against the orders of Aristides, who had been warned by Asklepios in a 62 INCUBATION IN THE CI'LT OF ASKLEPIOS dream not to let him go. His death followed from ai. chill. So the god had really cared for him according to the first vision, and his death was due to his dis\u00ad obedience. The vision of Athena, \u00a7300, is the second instance of a waking vision, clearly stated as such. After the time of the prophecy had been fulfilled, a plague broke out in Smyrna, 162 A.D. Aristides had been in good health, but fell a victim to it, and was in a dangerous state of bilious fever. While lying awake in bed he seemed to have a dream in which Asklepios and Athena appeared. Athena was in beauty and height like Pheidias' statue, and held the aegis, which seemed waxen. She was visible only to Aristides, for when he tried to point her out to his two friends and his attendant present, they could not see her, and began to fear for his sanity. At last they noticed that his strength waa being restored, and he communicated to them the words the goddess spoke to him, to the effect that, like Odysseus, he must hold out. \"Then the idea came to me to use Attic honey as a medicine, and I got rid of the biliousness.\" A course of medical treatment followed, with strict diet, of which he mentions goose liver and pork. He made a slow recovery, and was not wholly rid of the fever until the day when one of the best of the younger members of his household died. He recognised the prolongation of his life as a gift from the god who had taken the young life in his place. This idea of exchange of a soul for a soul and a body for a body finds expression in another passage, when Aristides does not fail to recognise the divine provi\u00ad dence in taking another soul in his place, \u00a7331. ARISTIDES ORATIONS 53 While at Smyrna he got the news that Philumena, the daughter of his foster-mother, waa very ill. He started to visit her, sending on a doctor. On the way he was caught in a severe storm and took refuge in the temple of Apollo, where be was detained for several days by dreams. Besides these dreams, he had, while sacrificing, a vision of a divine deliverer. An augur inquired if the deliverance was for ever, or merely a delay, but no clear answer was forthcoming. Meanwhile the death of the girl was announced, and all recognised that some deity was at work. This was even clearer from the sequel. Aristides had a dream that the father of the girl recorded the oracles about her, and that within her body, as in the case of victims used for augury, was the revelation of her fate. In this record occurred also the name of Aelius Aristides, and a statement that her soul was given for his. She was the sister of the boy whose death was mentioned in the last instance. Another case of prophecy is recorded, \u00a7294, when the god told him he must die three days after At the same time he gave him proofs of the truth of the oracle and also directions as to how to save himself. These consisted in sacrifices and sacred rites, and the dedication of his ring to Telesphoros. MEDICAL TREATMENT.\u2014The medical treatment to which Aristides was subjected is subordinated in his record to the wonders. In his Eulogy to Asklepios, \u00a738, he says: \"Truly the wonderful plays the leading part in the visitations of the god. He makes one man drink gypsum, another hemlock, while another has to strip and wash in cold 64 INCVBA'IiriN IN THB CULT OF ASKLEPIOS water, when you would think he needed heat. I myself have been honoured in this way. He has stopped catarrh and chills by river and sea bathing; he has cured |)rorttration with long walks; when I have been without food for some time he has added purging, and when I have been unable to breathe, I have been told to read and write.\" The ordinary hygienic measures ordained by Asklepios were cold water bathing, bleeding, anointing with mud or sand, walking with bare feet, exercise in the open air, and riding. The medicinal remedies suggested by the god are varied and curious. \u00a7315. He took nuts, figs, and dates, with bread, as emetics, and used for the digeation a compounded drug which Asklepiakos, a doctor, had given bim. This was replaced by another of four ingredients which he had to take after food. It was a mixture of Philon, and seemed agreeable to him now when the god had ordered it, though before he could not endure even the smell of it. He says that he cannot recount the numberless drugs the god ordered. He was strictly dieted aa befitted a dyspeptic, and various changes were made from time to time. \u00a7297. Absinth with vinegar was prescribed; \u00a7283, eggs were ordered and herbs; \u00a72f>8. honey and acorns as emetics. Wine was once forbidden, then allowed in moderutiun. He was allowed no animal food, exee|>t poultry, no vegetables, except lettuce and wild herbs (t/. the cure of Apellas), no sweets or fish. When suffering from toothache he got the following remedy from the god :\u2014\" To burn the tooth of a lion, cut it up and use it as a aoap, and wash out the mouth ARISTIDES' ORATIONS 55 with it. Then add pepper for the sake of heat, and lastly use as a soap Indian com.\" \u00a7328. -Another cure for toothache he finds in delivering a speech. A dream urges him to exercise oratory at a time when he can scarcely open his mouth for pain. After reading a discourse he finds the pain has vanished. \u00a7 1S7. .-V curious treatment of a tumour is recorded. Some time before the god had warned him to guard against dropsy. A tumour appeared later in an un\u00ad accountable way, and the doctors washed to take drastic measures to remove it. Asklepios bade him bear with it, and Aristides held out against all entreaties for four months. The god meanwhile prescribed such difficult exercise as promenades with bare feet, and riding on horseback. Then his attendant and he had the same dream, to rub on a drug of which one ingredient was salt. This done, the tumour disappeared, to the amazement of the doctors and friends. To complete the cure, egg was rubbed on by order of the god, and it was completely healed. \u00a7311. A sore throat was treated. He had to put on a plaster of cinnamon all round, and with that make a journey of 240 stades. He was able to endure the thirst both ways, and felt just like one going to a bath in the town. INTERPRETATION OF THE DBEJIMS.\u2014The method Aristides used to interpret the divine communications is left in obscurity, and the connection between the dream and the conclusion he draws from it ia not explained. \u00a7280. \" I dreamt that a bone was sticking in my 56 INCUBATION IN THE CULT OF ASKLEPIOS throat, and I had the idea of having myself bled, I did it and improved in no small degree.\" \u00a7300. The vision of Athena suggested Attic honey as a purgative. \u00a7275. \" After this dream I had an idea of taking a bath, yet not quite free from doubt.\" He determined, however, to bathe, and suffered severely for it. \u00a7285. A ease is given of a second vision sent to ex\u00ad plain a doubtful point in the first. He dreamt he was in Smyrna and was eating a fig, when an augur told him there was deadly poison in it. He hastened to take an emetic. When he awoke, he was not sure whether to interpret this dream to mean he should take an emetic or should fast, for there was said to be poison in the other figs also. So he asked the god for a clearer vision. He fell aaleep and dreamt he was in the temple at Pergamos, and told Theodotos that he was fasting, whereupon Theodotos tried to dissuade him from it. \u00a7318. He asked the god for a confirmatory sign, for he was doubtful how to act. He had been told before to keep his hands from off cows, and now waa ordered to sacrifice an ox. He had scruples about doing so. However, in answer to his appeal, a bright light Sashed on to the sacrifice, and he took courage and went on with it, \u00a7298, Sometimes the interpretation of the dream is quite simple, as here, when the drinking of absinth is clearly indicated by the introduction of that drug into the dream. \u00a7333. The sequence is hardly logical when he dreams about Lysias and is freed ( tAv^ ) from ARISTIDES' ORATIONS 57 tertian fever The benefit may be attributed to the verbal coincidence or to the good action of Lysias. Or, in \u00a7351, he dreams of the Clouds of Aristophanes, and next morning rain falls. The event is mentioned as a sequel to the dream, but, though subsequent, may not have been consequent. DREAMS ABOUT ORATORY.\u2014At tunes it seems as if his own thoughts were used as material for the dreams and converted into the god's opinions\u2014for example, iu the many flattering allusions to bis own brilliancy and oratorical powers which occur in the dreams. \u00a7360. He is set beaide Plato. \u00a7333. He is given the same place in oratory as Alexander the Great in war. \u00a7\u00a7281, 283. He consorts on familiar terms with the Emperors, and favours them with readings. \u00a7324. His practice of oratory was begun at the instigation of Asklepios. He had been commanded in a dream to deliver a speech, though he was suffering from want of breath, A friend told him that he knew of a similar case, where the patient bad been cured by the perspiration caused in the attempt to speak. So Aristides made an attempt, and that was the beginning of his orations. He further received encouragement from the orator Rosandros in a dream, in which he recalled Plato and Demosthenes. \u00a7327. His splendid powers as an orator made him think he received direct inspiration from Asklepios, In his speech to Asklepios he acknowledges the gift of oratory received from him. \u00a7309. He delivers a speech at Epheaus, then takes 58 INCUBATION IN THE CULT OF ASKLEPIOS a cold bath, and says : \" The onlookers marvelled no less at the bath than at the speech. Both were from the god.\" \u00a7328. He had been inspired while in Rome to write a complete (}aean to Apollo, though he had had no practice in the art \u00a7333. He had an inspiration in his sleep for a dedicatory epigram. \u00a7354. Hia orations were always highly successful. On this occasion he attracted great crowds while his opponent had an audience of seventeen only. \u00a73G1. He had a vision about his future glory. He dreamt he was at Athens and a brilliant flash struck his hair from the right side. This was said to signify glory. In the convereation preceding this portent, Aristides had expressed the opinion that true glory for men lay in their written works. PLACE OF INCUBATION,\u2014There is obscurity as to where the incubation took place. In only a few inatances does he mention where he was when the dream came to him. \u00a7307. According to a dream he took up his position between the doors and the gates of the Temple at Pergamoa. \u00a7309. Asklepios ordered him to take hia rest oil over the Temple, in the open air, or by the sacred torch of the god. \u00a7311, lie reposcti in the shrine of the aavioura. \u00a7340. ' 1 lay in the presence of the god and he gave me a wonderful dream \"\u2014 which he relates. \u00a7353. Ho passed the night in the Temple under the lamp. .-VRISTIDES OB.-VTIONS 69 RELATIONS WPTH PRIESTS.\u2014Aristides dealt directly with the god himself. The priests had secondary positions, but often figure as counsellors. ^398. Aristides was accustomed to relate bis dreams to the priest in whose house he stayed at Pergamos. Sometimes a priest had a dream about hiin. \u00a7312. A priest told Aristides that he was suffering from consumption. A priest came afterwards, and said that he had heard the god saying that Aristides had catarrh and consumption, and that his stomach was cured\u2014this without knowledge of the revelation to Ans tides. \u00a7297, A priest had a dream that Aristides should take absinth with vinegar, and Aristides had one to the same effect. \u00a7314. ArL-itides had been told in a dream to use a royal thing, from a woman. The priest explained that this must be an unguent lately deposited by a noble woman at the feet of Hygeia. He procured it and received great relief in his throat and back. Other people had dreams about Aristides. Neritos, one of his attendants (\u00a7312) told him that he had a dream in which the god told him that Aristides' bones and musclfi must be replaced by new ones. When he saw the distress this caused Neritos, he explained that there must take place a great change in Aristides' body, and he told him to recommend the use of olive-oil without salt. On another occasion (\u00a7288) Zosimos has the same dream as Aristides on the same night. \u00a7322. When they were at the famous Temple of Poimanon in Mysia, a farmer who did not know of Aristides dreamt about him. 60 INCUBATION IN THE CULT OF ASKLEPIOS \u00a7334. Epagathos, a faithful and godly old attendant, dreamt that he heard the following words about Aristides\u2014\"For him will the mother of the gods care.\" So Aristides.adopted the name of Theodores, considering himself, bis body, life, and power of speech, a gift from the god. RELATIONS WITH DOCTORS.\u2014There is constant mention of doctors. His attendant Zosimos was skilled in medicine (\u00a7290). But Aristides recognised the god as the only authority, and following his counsels against those of the doctors, though at the same time maintaining friendly relations with them. \u00a7286. Aristides had a vision as to the nature of his illness which he related to the doctor, who at once recognised the right d^gnosis of the case. He pro\u00ad claimed Asklepios to be the true healer, and proceeded to consult him on further points, \u00a7311, Aristides mentions a renowned doctor of Pergamos, called Satyros, who told him to stop the bleeding to which he waa submitting, and to apply a plaster he gave him. .-\\ristides kept the gift, but refused to stop the bleeding, which the god had ordered. Later on, at Lebedos, he thought he would apply the plaster, and did so, with dire results. The god declared that he had brought on consumption. \u00a7288. The doctors were forced to admire the healing powers of the god, when he made the tumour disappear by applying a drug. \u00a7295. The doctora look on with astonishment at the winter-baths in the river. MISCELLANEOUS DREAMS.\u2014Aristides became so ac\u00ad customed to the help of dreams that he consulted the god on all kinds of subjects. ARISTIDES' 0R.\\TI0NS gj \u00a7346. An estate of his was seized by enemies. By the help of the god he gained access to the governor and recovered his property. \u00a7293. He was caught in a storm by sea on h^ way to Chios. Amid the universal alarm, he called, \" 0 Asklepios,\" and all were saved. At night the god told him it waa fated he should suffer shipwreck, and that W\"as the cause of the events. \u00a7329. He was saved from a storm by the god, who persuaded him to remain at Delos in spite of the wishes of the crew. All recognised the divine pro\u00ad vidence when a terrible tempest set in, \u00a7323. He was saved from the plague by Athena and Asklepios, \u00a7318. He was saved from an earthquake by being sent to Mt. Atys, which escaped the upheaval in 151 A.D. \u00a7356. He asked for a sign when it was the proper time to approach the governor and present a petition. And he received it. \u00a7338. He was saved from holding ofSce. Severos, the governor, had decided he should be guardian of the peace for a certain town of Mysia. Aristides asked for help to escape this, and got a Delphic verse in answer \u2014\" I and the white maidens shall care for that.\" The white maidens proved to be letters from the Emperors, which freed him from necessity to serve. But Severos determined to give him an bonoraiy position as niler, and he had again to get the god's help. By the influence of the secretary he was released. \u00a7345. He escaped holding the priesthood of Asia by accepting the priesthood of Asklepios. 62 INCLBATION IN THE CULT OF ASKLEPIOS Aristides had cause for gratitude in all this varied assistance, and is not sparing in the expression of it. His habitual title for Asklepios is Saviour or Lord. \u00a737. \" Asklepios is he who has guided and directed all. Saviour of the Umvetse, and guardian of the immortals, or in the language of tragedy, the steers\u00ad man at the helm.\" CONNECTION WITH SERAPIS AND ISIB.\u2014\u00a7294. The prophecy of his connection with Serapis was that he had three years to serve with him. \u00a7319. Serapis appeared with Isis and .\\sklepios, and there was a striking inter-resemblance. Then after the death of Zosimos, Serapis appeared with a pruning-knife, and proceeded to cut away defile\u00ad ments from round Aristides' face, and to make it seemly. Later came a vision from the chthonian gods that it would be better for him not to grieve so much for the dead. He had another vision of ladders over and under the earth, and saw things unrecountable. He learned the power of the god, how Serapis was able to convey men wherever he wished without chariots or bodies. He knew that he must sacrifice to Serapis, and had (\u00a7320) another sign of this when he met two geese aa he left the Temple of Isis after sacrificing to the two deities of the Temple. \u00a7319. Isis demanded an offering of two geese. He had difficulty in procuring them as there were only two geese in the place. The ow-iur hud been told, he said, by Isis, to keep them for Aristides \u00a7344. When Aristides was in difficulties about escap\u00ad ing election to office, he reeeived oraclea from Isis and Serapis that the affair would be successfully concluded, and that he would be on good terms with his enemies. IV. Incubation in the Cult of Asklepios ROME AND LEBENE THE TEMPLE OF AESCCL.\\PIUS ON THE TIBER ISLAND,\" \u2014To the same period as the Ajjellas case and the Orations of .Aristides, that is, to the second century A.D., belong the four inscriptions^ of cures found on the Tiber Island at Rome. On this island a temple of Aesculapius stood, the most ancient, and also the most important, in the neighbourhood of Rome. Both temple and cult were entirely Greek. The worship of Aesculapius does not seem to have been subjected to any process of nafurahsation at Rome. Its adoption was direct from Greece, and the new branch kept the same forms as the parent-stem. The tradition of the temple's foundation, which is well authenticated, is given by Valerius Maximus, who took it from Livy. In 293 B.C., the Sibylline books advised the summons of the Greek god Asklepios, on account of continued plague. An embassy was sent to Epidauros, as chief centre of the cult, and they brought back the healer in the form of one of the sacred serpents. As they sailed up the Tiber, the serpent landed on the island, thus choosing the site for the temple. A similar legend is found in Pausanias (iii, 23. 6), concerning the foundation of another offshoot from Epidauros\u2014the temple at Epidauros Limera. \u00bbBeanier\u2014/.'/; Tih6rine. INCUBATION IN THE CULT OF ASKLEPIOS He relates that a state embassy was sailing from Epidauros to Asklepios at Kos, and touched at Epidauros Limera. A snake that was on board ship escaped, and went down into the earth not far from the sea. \"So on account of this portent aa well as dreams, they determined to remain and found a colony there. Where the snake went down into the earth stand the altars of Asklepios, and an olive-grove grows round about.\" The Tiber Island, where the serpent is said to have landed, is now called the island of San Bartolomeo, and is reached by the bridge of Quattro Capi. On it stands a little monastery with a garden of orange and myrtle trees, und attached to the monastery is the large hospital of the Fate Bene Fratelli, belonging to the brothers of San Giovanni di Dio. It may- be con- jectored that the isolation of the site, which makes it admirably adapted for the modern hospital, accounted also for the foundation of the temple of Aesculapius, likewise the resort of the sick. The temple is now replaced by the church of San Bartolomeo, built in the eleventh century. 'Some relics of the temple are seen in the church. The monolithic cohiums and two bases of pillars seem to come from antiquity, and in the middle of the altar steps is a well, the pecuhar position of which shows that it must have existed before the foundation of the church. In all probability it had been the sacred well of Aesculapius, and was respected by the Christians when they succeeded to the pagana. The most interesting sign that remains of the ancient sanctity attached to the island is the fragment of the original decoration which is still to be seen when the water of the Tiber ia low. .Vt the aoutb-east end of BOMB 65 the island, ahncrat at the point, one descends a little wooden staircase at the side of the morgue, and finds there traces of antiquity. To recall tlie coming of the divine serpent, the island was given the form of a trireme, but the work has been almost wholly destroyed by the swift Tiber floods. Still at this point one sees blocks of tufa going deep down into the sand, and supporting eight layera of travertine. This represents the side of a ship. On it are vestiges of a human bust\u2014some hair and the shouldere are clearly distinguishable\u2014and beside the bust is a staff round which a serpent coils, Aesculapius no doubt was here represented. Farther along is an ox head without eare or horns. Besnier dates the work in the middle of the fii^t century B.C. It is not known to what extent the island was thus decorated, but small traces of stone work have been found at other parts. In the centre of the island stood an obelisk of imperial times, repre\u00ad senting the ship's mast. Its fragments are now in the museums. No sign has been found of the existence of porticos in coimeetion with the temple, but apart from the fact that they are an ordinary adjunct to Asklepieia, their presence is attested by passages from various authors. Livy (ii. 5) mentions temples and porticos on the island, and Plutarch (Popl. 8) says: \" This island is now sacred for the city. It has temples of the gods and porticos.\" As in the other temples they would serve as sleeping-places for the suppliants to the god. The numerous ex-voto inscriptions found at Rome and iu the neighbourhood show that Aesculapius waa worshipped at different places in the surrounding 66 INCUHATI0N IN THB CULT OF ABKLBPI08 district, such as Tibur and Caieta, as well as at Some. But the introduction of the cult was not followed by striking succeas. The Roman temple did not prove a rival to the Greek, It seems, on the contrary, never to have risen above a certain level of insignificance. Aristides the Orator, and the Panegyrist of many sanc\u00ad tuaries of Asklepios, makes no mention of the Roman temple, although he visited the city. From the ex- voto inscriptions it appears that its devotees were chiefly slaves and freedmen, the only notable name associated with the cult being that of Antoninus Fins. The following inscriptions' are examples of the dedications on votive offerings given to the Roman Aesculapius :\u2014 A. To the saviour Asklepios, Nikomedes, as thank- offering for life preserved. This fair image of the son of the divine healer, boy new-bom, thou bast devised and wrought for mortals, 0 Boethos, as a memorial for posterity of thy skilful craft, Nikomedes dedicated it as an offering for deUverance from dire disease, and as a monument of ancient handiwork. B. To the king Asklepios, as thank-offering for life preserved, Nikomedes, doctor of Smyrna. Such as waa the yoang child who was bom to Phoibos of the flowing locks by the daughter of Phlegyas, 0 healer Asklepios, is the statue of fine work which Boethos has wrought for thee with his skill. In this temple thy servant has dedicated it to be seen as a thank-offering for life preserved, since by thy counsels he has been rescued from illness\u2014a small gift of thankful praise, such as mortal men give to show their gratihide to the gods, ' C.I.O. IU. 687*. The above inscriptions were found near Trajan's Baths, and belong, probably, to the second or third century A.D. In The Tiber Island a small stand of marble, the base of a silver offermg, was found vrith the following inscription on it. The name of the dedicator, Julianus, and the shape of the letters make it probable that it belongs to the time of Augustus. It tolls that the object supported by this stand was an image of the or^tn cured by the god, and runs thus' :\u2014To Asklepios, the great god, the saviour and benefactor, saved by thy hands from a tumour of the apicen, of which this is the silver model, as a mark of gratitude to the god ; Neochares Julianus, a freed- man of the imperial household. Many other dedications have been found both in Latin and Greek, and they show, by the messages they convey and by their similarity to the votive offer\u00ad ings of other incubation temples, that the practice was carried on at Rome. They tell us, however, nothing about the method. For this our only guide is found in the four inscriptions of cures belonging to the Tiber Island. The marble slab on which they were written was lost at the time of the Renaissance, but the text is known from copies. The following is the translation from the Greek* :\u2014 1. At thi', time the god made a revelation to Gaius, a blind man, that he should approach the holy altar and there do reverence; then go from the right to the left, and place his five fingers on the altar; then raise his handennd lay it on his own eyes. He could see ' Besnier\u2014!.'/(\u00a3 Tihirine, p. 213. 'C./.O. 5B80. 68 IKftJBATION IN THB CULT OP ASKLEPIOS clearly, and the people stood by and rejoiced to see these great powers working in the time of the Emperor Antoninus. 2. Lucius suffered from pleurisy and had been despaired of by all. The god made a revelation to him that he should go and lift ashes from the triangular altar, and mix them with wine, and lay them on his side. He was saved, aud he offered thanks publicly to the god, and the people rejoiced with him. 3. Julianus suffered from hemorrhage and had been despaired of by all. The god made a revelation to him that he should go and lift from the triangular altar some pine-cones, and should eat them with hoi]e\\ for three days. He was saved, and he came and gave thanks publicly before the people. 4. The god made a revelation to Valerius Aper, a blind soldier, that be should go and take the blood of a white cock along with honey and compound an eye-salve, and with it anoint his eyes for three days. He regained his sight, and went and gave thanks pub\u00ad licly to the god. The Emperor mentioned is either Caracalla or Antoninus Pius; therefore the date ia the second century A,D. The inscriptions are closely allied to the Epidaurian cures. They are inspired by the same spirit, but their method is different from that of the two classes treated above\u2014the ancient miracle cures and the Ajwllas inscription. The closest parallel to them is found in the two fragmentary inscriptions discovered in the village of Miamii, in Crete. They belong to the sanctuary of .Asklepios at Lebene, ijijiich was greatly frequented by the Cretans, according to Philostratos (Vita Apoll. iv. 34). .LEBENE.\u2014The Lebene inscriptions differ in That of Poplios Granios is spaced widely, with titlo-lines, and is divided into two distinct para\u00ad graphs. Inscription I,, on the contrary, has its three parts closely connected by a participial constmction in a concise form. The explanation seems to be that the inscription of Granios is the original lotive inscription, while the other is one of a series collected for the benefit of the Temple visitora, like those at Epidauros. Remnants of pre\u00ad ceding and succeeding inscriptions can be traced on the stele. INSCRIPTION I.^ A certain woman (name obliterated) gives thanks to the saviour Asklepios. She had an inflamed ulcer on her little finger, and was cured by the god, who ordered her to bum and grind down an oyster-shell and apply it. Then to anoint the finger with rose-ointment, and mallow with olive-oil. So I was cured. I beheld the great powers of the god in sleep, and he bade me inscribe my visions. INSCRIPTION II.^ To Asklepios. Poplios Granios. According to command. I had had a cough constantiy for two years, and the whole day I was bringing up suppurating matter, when the god took in hand to cure me. He gave me an herb, eruca, to take after fasting, and Italian pepper to drink; fine meal with hot water, then a powder from the ashes of the altar with holy 'Alh. Miahta. CULT OF ABKLEPIOS wator; then an egg and pine-resin; next black piteh, next the iris plant with honey, then a quince The rest of the inscription is fragmentary. Apart from the mention of publicity which is peculiar to the Roman inscriptions, the form of the two sets is, to all intents and purpcmes, identical. In brief, there is a combination of rational cure with mystic rites, Tho god does not cure personally as in the ancient miracles, but gives the patient guidance by dreams. The treatment, however, is not similar to the dietary and hygienic measures of Apellas or Aristides. Myotic medicaments are prescribed and the exact ingredients detailed in the dreams. It is an open question whether the efficacy of these drugs was a negligible quantity, or whether they served some therapeutic purpose. If they were useless parapher\u00ad nalia, then the cures must be explained as faith miracles. Gauthier, in his Rdcherche Historique sur I'Exercice de la MMicine takes the view that these cures are to be explained independently of hygienic and thcrn]>entie treatment. They would be effected by the powerful influence of the imagination on the nervous system, and by the unlimited confidence which the patients reposed in remedies that they believed to be advised by a god. The first of the Roman inacriptiona may be explained in thia way. It is a simple faith-miracle. A blind man recovers his sight through conveying the sacred power of the altar to his eyes by touch. Some of the ancient Epidaurian inscriptions were of the same nature. On the other hand, the first Lebene inscription might be called a semi-rational cure. Ointment is pre\u00ad scribed for an ulcer without ceremonies, and its healing LEliENB 71 properties would be intensified by the faith of the patient. The prescriptions tor the other cases appear to have a deeper significance. They are not rational cures nor simple faith-miracles. Rather they are tinged with the mysticism of nmgic rites. A symbolic system is conveyed in the ingredients, which stand in special connection and relationship with the cult. Deubner' proves a close connection between these tokens used as medicaments and the prescriptions given in the papyri dealing with ancient magic, aud it seems beyond doubt that these inscriptions of the Asklepios cult express a certain symbolism. The second Roman inscription prescribes asbea mixed with wiue for pleurisy, and the second Lebene inscription includes ashes as one of the remedies for the cough. The ashes in both cases were to be taken from the altar, and therein lay their efficacy as a sacred healing medium. Wine, which was to be mixed with the ashes, was much used in the rites of the chthonian gods and the cult of the dead. Frequent mention of it is found in the Magic Papyri of Kenyon and Wessely. In the third case, pine-cones are prescribed to be taken from the altar, and thus they would be sacred like the ashes. The fact that they were to be found on the altar makes it probable that they were a usual offering to the god, and they are certainly connected with the cult, for Pausanias (ii. 10), giving a description of the Asklepios of Sikyon, work of Ealomis, says : '\" The god had in the other hand the fruit of the cultivated pine.\" Honey, which was to be taken with the pine-cones, was much used along with wine and nulk in chthonian worship, and is frequently mentioned iJe/nciii.,ch.a. 72 INCUBATION IN THE CULT OP ASKLEPIOB in the Magic Papyri. The length of the treatment is likewise given in a symbolic way, for the number three had special magic properties. In the fourth inscription, an eye-salve is prescribed to cure blindness. The ingrediente, here too, have a connection with the cult. The blood of a white cock waa to be mixed with honey and applied for three days. Honey and the number three both occurred in the previous inscriptions. The cock was, like the serpent, an animal sacred to Asklepios, and it is well known how Sokrates, in the Phaido, just before death, says that he owes a cock to .Asklepios. White was a favourite colour for sacrificial animals and in magic rites, according to the Papyri. A salve, such as thia, made of blood and honey, is found in Wessely's New Greek Magic Papyri, p. 93. The prescription is as follows: \"Invocation. Prayer to the star Aphrodite. The blood and fat of a white dove, raw myrrh and boiled wormwood : make together a salve and sacrifice . . .\" The dove was sacred to Aphrodite as the cock to Asklepios, and the use of collyria or salves in magic and chthonian rites is of frequent occurrence. It is clear from the above that a certain intimate relationship must have existed between the rites of ancient magic and the heahng art as practised at the centres of incubation in connection with chthonian gods. Another passage from the Magic Papyri (43.694) supports this doctrine. It details the ceremonies to be performed when invoking Asklepios before incuba\u00ad tion, and the translation is as follows : \" Taking a lizard from the water, leave it in lily oil until it dies. Then cut the ring off from the Asklepios at Memphis from the iron chain and throw it into the hly oil, and when thou consultest the oracle, take the ring and point it to the north, saying these words seven times : ' Menophoi, 0 thou who art seated on the cherubim, send me the true Asklepios without any hostile roaming sprite.\" Then take the censer where thou art going to sleep, and offer up three grains of frankincense and turn thy finger round in the frankincense smoke, saying these words seven times : ' Chanaps; oaeikps; oaklusiphtha; 0 lord Asklepios, appear.' And do thou wear the ring on the forefinger of the right band.\" V. Incubation in the Cult of Asklcpios ATHENS AND KOS THE TEMPLES OP ASKLEPIOS AT ATHENS AND Kos. \u2014Athens and Kos were two of the most important centres of the cult of Asklepios, but in neither of the sanctuaries have any clues been found to solve the problem of incubation. The Athenian Asklepieion has been excavated on the south side of the Acropolis, between the theatre of Dionysos and the Odeon. A short description of the sanctuary is given by Pausanias (i, 21. 4), and this site agrees with his account. The buildings are situated on a long terrace divided into two small terraces, On the eastern terrace one can clearly distinguish the foundations of the temple, to the east a large altar, and behind a long colonnade. This colonnade corresponds to the porticos at Epidauros, and waa in all probability the Abaton. Traces of a stair\u00ad case have been found, so that, as at Epidauros, it was a two-storeyed building. At the east end, next the Dionyaiac theatre, a door in the back of the portico leads into a grotto hollowed out in the rock, where there is a sacred well. It is wtill used as a shrine, and a picture of the Virgin with votive candles is worshipped. The situation of the portico nfzainst the Acropolis wall, facing south, made it a salubrious place for the patients who came to sleep there. It can be seen that the colonnade was paved with Hymottian marble, which shows that its dato ia not ATHENS 75 earlier than the fourth ccntuiy B.C., nor can it have been much later, to judge from the excellence of the masonry. The date of the foundation of the temple cannot be determined, but an inscription (C. /. A. II. 1649) gives a lengthy account of the bringing of the god from the Peloponnese, of the foundation of the sanctuary, and of the subsequent alterations. This inscription dates from the beginning of the fourth century B.C., so that it is seen that the temple must have existed in the fifth century B.C. On the second terrace have been excavated buildings similar in many respects to those on the first, and while Girard' takes these to be duplicates, either of earlier or later date, of the Asklepieion, Kohler^ considers that they form the sanctuary of Themis. In support of his theory Girard brings forward an inscription (C. I. A. II. 1, Addenda, 489 b) which speaks of an ancient temple and of a later one, but no inscriptions have been found to give conclusive proof. Nor have we any record of the cures performed in the temple. The only account of treatment is the literary evidence given in the scene of the Ploutos, which has been quoted above. The grateful patients may have inscribed their cures as at Epidauros, Trikka, and Kos; at least they agreed with the suppliants at theae other temples in the nature of the votive offerings dedicated to the god. An inscription (C. I. A. II. 835-6) gives a list of such offerings, and their variety is great, indicating a clientele from all classes. There were baa-reliefs, statues, images of parts of the body, and hymns in honour of the god. 'L'Aetlepieion fTAthenee , p. 6. ^Athai. MiUhal. IL 256. 76 INCUBATION IN THE CULT OF ABKLEPIOS The priest was regarded as a servant of the god, and the temple was not a hospital but a shrine, so that the priest did not figure openly as a doctor. Whether he had skill in medicine is open to discussion. Inscrip\u00ad tions giving a priest's duties make no mention of hia share in the cures. In one inscription iC. I. A. II, 1. Add., 453 b) the phrase occurs -.roiKad'iKaimjv^fiipay 7ivo/neVtts Stpajrtiui. The reference is to one of the reasons for honouring the jiriest in whose favour the decree was given. If Qtpairtias referred to the cures, then it would prove that the priest had a share in them, but the word is used of temple service, such aa the priest was bound to give, and such aa is described in the Ploutos as the duty of the priest. Kos.\u2014The same dearth of inacriptiona dealing with incubation that we have remarked at Athens, is found again in the still more celebrated temple at Kos. It is indisputable that Kos was an incubation centre, although as yet no inscriptions have been found describing the methods. The close connection which existed between Kos and Epidauros would be sufficient guarantee of the fact. In historic times, Kos received an embassy w ith sacred serpents from Epidauros (Pans. hi. 23), and whether Kos was thus a colony of the great Asklepieion, or had before received the cult from Thessaly, this much is certain, that the supremacy of Epidauros was recognised by Kos. One inscription' shows that incubation was practised in the island. Beneath the relief of an eagle stand the words, \"Hekataios, according to a dream.\" It was found in the deme Haleis. ' PfttoD and \"Bicka\u2014IniCTipt. of Cot, No. 34S. Kos 7T The temple of Asklepios in Kos has not yet been completely excavated, as at Epidauros, but during 1902 and 1903 important discoveries were made by Herzog, who was carrying on the work. At the time of his firet visit to the island in 1898, he was of opinion that the site of the temple waa to be located in the plain to the west of the ancient town. He excavated there and found the ruins of a Roman house. The only clue in ancient writers to the position of the Asklepieion is given by Strabo and Aristides, who speak of it as \" in the neighbourhood of the city.\" Paton,' who visited Kos before Herzog, put forward the surmise that the ancient temple of Asklepios stood near the ruined convent called Jlavayla riji Tdpa-ov, which is situated on a hillside near tbe Turkish village of Kermeti, about haK an hour from the town of Kos. Sections of massive pillars and many marbles were found on this site, and on the hill-side above are red- water and medicinal springe. Herzog began to excavate above this convent in October, 1902, and the results of researches have verified Paton's conjecture. The great temple^ stands on a terrace on a slope of the Mil, and all its visible stracture has been of white marble. It is surrounded by porticos, and a marble flight of steps leads down to the lower terrace. On this stand two other temples, a great altar, and a semi- drculor fountain, into which flowed a spring of water. Near by is a large open square, which probably served as a resort for the suppliants to the temple. Of these two temples on the lower terrace one is 'Op.eU.,p. 136. 'Biv. ArcJUol. 19W. Remach, p. 127 78 INCUBATION IN THE CULT OF ASKLEPIOS supposed to have been the ancient Asklepieion, and the other to belong to the Roman period. The great temple on the higher terrace dates from the beginning of the second century u.c., and inscriptions have been found ranging from 3U0 B.C. to the third century A.D. The temple was probably destroyed by the earthquake of 554 A.D. Among the pieces of sculpture already excavated are a fine head of the god, and some serpents. Most of the inscriptions deal with the great games, which were celebrated every four yeara. Two decrees of the third century A.D. have been found, expressing the grati\u00ad tude of other cities for the services of doctors who had come to them from Kos. This shows that the medical school of Kos maintained the position of im\u00ad portance to which it was elevated by Hippokrates, In Pliny (N.H. 29.4) wc read: \"The subsequent history (of medicine), strange to say, waa enveloped in darkest night until the Peioponnesian War, when it was brought into the light of day by Hippocistes, who was born in Cos, a powerful and famous island, sacred to A(;sculapius. It is said that he copied out the inscriptions which it had been the custom for tht^e cured of disease to inscribe in the temple of the god, telling the help they had received, so that thereafter similar treatment might be used; and, a? Varro in our day believes, the temple was Ihereaftei biumed, and he instituted the medicine which is called clinical,\" And in StiBbo (p. 657) : \" They say Uiat Hippo\u00ad krates carried out his dietetic meiiaiires in accordance with the cures exposed to view there (at Kos).\" In another passage (ii. 63), Sirabo classes the votive inscriptions of Kos witli those of Epidauros. KOS 79 As the recent excavations have given us no informa\u00ad tion regarding these inscriptions, we can only con\u00ad jecture their nature from the ancient writers. There is no evidence to lead us to believe that miracles, auch as are recorded in the Epidaurian inscriptions, were performed also at Kos. Epidauros may have owed its pre-eminence in those early times to the miraculous powers of the divinity. At Kos it would seem that prescriptions were given to those who practised incubation, and those Hippokrates may have studied, thus connecting the divine with the lay medicine, which he developed so greatly that Kos waa for long the leading medical school. VI. Incubation at the Oracle of Amphiaraos AmphiaraoB ranks among the chthonian deities of prehistoric times. The chief centre of his cult was Oropos, where the Amphiareion is seen to have been a splendid temple, deserving the renown it enjoyed. In central Greece and the Peloponnese Amphiaraos was highly honoured, but, by a curious limitation, his sphere did not extend further. In the east and west Amphilochos, traditionally son of Amphiaraos, took his place and was practically identical with him. In the cult of Amphiaraoa his medical powers had special prominence. He was worahipped as a prophetic hero, a giver of oracles and diviner of dreams, and was consulted chiefly with regard to sickness and disease. Aa a healing god he was honoured from early times to late, and it is evident that he was closely connected with Asklepios, the chief healer. From the cures of Oropos, from a headless statue and a relief, we see that the two gods were portrayed by the same type, and on the reUef Hygeia, who figures as daughter of Aaklepioa, stands by Amphiaraos. Extensive excavations have been made since 1884 at the sanctuary of Amphiaraos near Oropos. From the ruins that have been found, it is judged that the building belongs to Macedonian or early Roman times. About seventy yards to the east of the temple stood a large colonnade, which is taken to be the sleeping- hall where incubation was practised. In the centre of the colonnade was a large square room. Round the walls of this room have bcou found stone supports for AJ1PHIAR.\\0S 81 benches, forty-five of which are preserved, while there were fifty-three in all. Thia central part was probably the dormitory mentioned in the inscription (G.I.G.G.S. No. 235) which relates many of the temple rules and regiihitions. and is believed to have been inscribed in the fourth century, between 420 and 350 B.C. The test is given by Wiliamowitz,' and the translation is as follows :\u2014 The priest of Amphiaraos shall go to the temple when winter is past until the time for ploughing comes, and shall not leave it for more than three days. He shall remain in the temple not less than ten days each month. And he shall compel the temple servant to attend to the sanctuary according to the rules, and to look after those who come to the temple. If anyone, either a stranger or a townsman, com\u00ad mit an offence in the temple, the priest shall impose a fine not exceeding five drachmas, and shall take security from the person fined. If he pay the money in the presence of the priest, he shall consign it to the treasury. The priest shall impose a penalty of not more than three drachmas, if any one of the strangers or townsmen in the temple suffers a private injury; and in the more important eases the judgments shall be given where the laws appoint in each case; summons shall be made on the same day in the court of offences in the temple, and, if the accused does not yield, the trial shall be completed on the next day. All who are about to be treated by the god shall give a preliminary offering of not less than nine obols of standard silver, and shall put it into the treasury in presence of the temple servant. 'Htrmtg, XXI. p. 91. 82 AMPH1.4RA06 The priest, when present, shall pray over the sacrificial victims, and shall lay them on the altar; when he is absent, the eacrifieer himself shall pray over his own sacrifice; m public sacrifices the priest must officiate. The skin of all animals sacrificed in the temple. Anyone is free to sacrifice whatever he wishes, but he must not carry the flesh outside the precincts. Those who sacrifice must give to the priest out of each sacrifice the shoulder, except when there is a festival, and then he shall take a shoulder from the public sacrifices. . The auppliant goes to sleep obedient to the rules. The temple-servant shaU write down the name of the sleeper and the name of his city when he pays in the money, and the writing on the tablet shall be exposed to view in the temple for those who wish to see it. In the dormitory, the men and women sleep in different parts, the men in the part to the east, and the women in the jiart to the west of the altar. In the above inscription it is unfortunate that the lines dealing with the actual process of incubation are indecipherable. All we learn is about the allotment of the east side for men, and the west for women. The rest deals with rules for the priest's duties, for payment of fees and registration, and for the preliminary sacrificial rites and ceremonies. It is noteworthy that the choice of victim is left to the suppliant\u2014a liberty which is in direct contrast to the express commands and usual distinctions of black and white, male and female, made by most AMPHIARAOS 83 deities. Pausan^ (ix. 19) gives a parallel in the worship of Artemis at Aiilis : \"It is said that at Aulis the Greeks had not a favouring gale, and that when the fair wind did spring up suddenly, every man sacrificed to Artemis whatever he happened to have, male and female animals indis\u00ad criminately, and from that time it has continued to be a nUe iu Aulis that all victims are lawful.\" It is to be calculated from the inscription that the supphant held a sort of sacrificial feast after the ceremony. Only the shoulder had to be given to the priest; the rest he could keep for himself, hut the consecrated flesh must not be taken outside the pre\u00ad cincts. Hence the necessity for a Homeric banquet on the sacred ground, at which the pious pilgrim would prepare his own meal, and feast to the glory of the god whose suppliant he was. A more comprehensive account is given by Pausanias (i. 34) of the ceremonies in connection with the oracle of Amphiaraos. He says that Amphiaraos was wor\u00ad shipped near Oropos, and that his renown waa due to hie power of prophetic dreama. \" Near the temple is the spring of Amphiaraos, which it is not right to use for purification or for washing the bands. But whoever is cured of disease in consequence of an oracle has to throw silver or gold coins into the water. It it said that Amphiaraos arose from it a god . And first, those who came to consult the oracle of Amphiaraos are accustomed to purify themselves, sacrifice to him and to all whose names [are on the altara]. After the completion of these preliminaries, they sacrifice a ram, and spreading its skin down they sleep on it, and await the manifestation of a dream.\" 84 AMPHIARAOS The first point in the ntcs was the preliminary sacrifice which was considered as an act of purification, and which is found to be a customary prelude to incuba\u00ad tion. Mention of it is made in one of the Epidaurian inscriptions (No. 5) when the same word (rpoffvardai) is used. This was followed by a second sacrifice. A ram was offered up just before incubation. Similar sacrifices were made m the rites of Trophonios. There was first a preliminary one, and then on the night before consultation a black ram was sacrificed over the pit of the Agamcdes, The black colour of the victim and the position in which the sacrifice was made, showed that the offering was to a hero, not a god. In Pausanias (v. 13) a similar sacrifice to Pelops as a hero is related. After the sacrifice of the ram to Amphiaraos, the suppliant spread the ram skin, and slept on it awaiting the pro\u00ad phetic dream. In Daunia the same ceremonies were performed in connection with the oracles of Kalchas and Podaleirios. Strabo (vi 284) relates that \" shrines of heroes are shown at the hill in Daunia called Drion. There is one of Kalchas at the top of the hill. Those who consult the oracle sacrifice to him a black ram and sleep on the skin.\" And in Lycophrou, with Tzetzes' note, we learn that the men of Daunia slept on sheepskins by the tomb of Podaleirios, and received oracles from him in sleep. In Italy, at the ancient oracle of Faunus, as described in Aeneid (vii. 81) and Ovid's Fasti (iv. 649), a sheep was sacrificed, the skin spread on tiie gi-ound, and the inquirer slept on it awaiting the oracle in a dream. The prevalence of the usage is due to a belief that the skin of a consecrated victim exorcised a sanctifying AMPHIARAOS 86 and protective influence. Other rites, such as the making of shoes from the skins, originated from the same supierBtition. Fra.;er, in his Pausanias, gives an instance in modern times from Pinkerton's Voyages (Hi. p. 610), where a Scottish Highlander is said to have passed the night wrapped in a cow's skin, awaiting an oracle. Further ceremonies in the consultation of Amphi\u00ad araos consisted in the observance of abstinence and certain dietary restrictions. Philostratos (Vita Apoll. ii. 37) says : \" The priests receive the suppliant to the oracle (Amphiaraos), and restrain him from food one day and from wine two days.'' Fasting is the ceremony of moat frequent occurrence in connection with oracles. It produced a certain state of mind which was believed to be conducive to dreams. At Acharaka, the priests left the patients several days without food at the Plutonion, according to Strabo (xiv, 650). Wine was forbidden, as Philostratos explains, because of its disturbing influence on the senses. Another probable restriction was laid on beans. In the Geoponici (ii, 33) we find: \"And first Amphiaraos abstained from beans on account of hia prophetic gift of dreams,\" And in a fragment of the Amphiaraos of Aristophanes: \" Thou who revilest that finest of relishes, the bean,\" The explanation, as given by Plutarch (Sympos. viii. 10) is that beans were believed to act in a special way on the mind, so that dreams were checked. No further details are to be gathered of the rites preceding the consultation of Amphiaraos. After the oracle had been given and the cure effected, it was customary to offer up a model of the healed 8G AMPH1AEAO.S part of the body, according to the inscription (/. G. S. 303). it is probable that this custom, which was also practised in the temples of Asklepios, arose from a more ancient one, by which, before the healing, an image of tlie uiemlier to be healed was hung up in the neighbourhood of the god's statue, as a sort of guide for the deity. In the inscription of the temple regu\u00ad lations wc are told that certain fees had to be paid, and Pausanias mentions the further duty of throwing coins into the sacred well, after cure. This last rite has been widely practised in a thanksgiving for restored health, both in ancient and modern times, PUny (Epist. viii. 18) tells that coins were still to be seen lying at the bottom of the Clitumnian spring; and Suetonius, in his Augustus (p. 57), says that all ranks at Rome annually threw money into the lake of Curtius in fulfil\u00ad ment of a vow for the health of Augustus. Seneca (Quaest. Nat. iv. 2) gives a reference to Egypt, where at certain festivals the priests threw money into the Nile. In modern folk-lore water-rites play a large part. Everywhere holy wells are to be found, and various ceremonies connected with these. Cornish people still drop into their holy wells offerings of pins, nails, rags, expecting from the waters cures for diseases and omens from their bubbles as to health and marriage, \" At Rome,\" says Frazer,^ \" there still is the Fontana di Trevi, into which people throw coins in the belief they ensure their return to the city. The spring of St. Morand in Brittany is believed to possess the property of curing fever; patients must resort to it fasting and without s|Joaking. Not many years ago coins were ' P,.,i^ II 476. AMPHURAOS 87 thrown into it. Now they are put in the poor's box,\" The spring of Amphiaraos, doubtless, proved a good substitute for the commonplace offering box, and after dropping the coins, as required, into it, the suppliant had completed the ceremonies connected with this act of incubation, and was free to depart. Vn. Incubation as practised at the Oracle of Trophonios The ceremonies of incubation at the oracle of Tro\u00ad phonios resemble in many respects thoae of the Amphiareion, but there is one great difference between the two. At the Amphiareion the act of incubation itself waa by simple temple-sleep, while the suppliant to Trophonios had to descend into the depth of the earth and there meet with the god. We have evidence that the intercourae which there took place waa by means of dreams, so that Trophonios ia to be ranked as an incubation-oracle, Cclsus (Apud. Grig. vii. 35) classes Trophonios with Amphiaraos and Mopsoa, who both appeared in dreams, and Tertullian names him among incubation-oracles. Also Plutarch, De Genio Socratis (p. 22), supports this view in the account of the sen\u00ad sations experienced by Timarcbos when consulting Trophonios. \" He said he went down into the shrine and lay a long time without quite knowing whether he was awake or dreaming.\" Several authore relate the proceedings in connection with a consultation of Trophonios; amongst them the chief are Strabo, Philostratos, and Plutarch, and the fullest account is given by Pausanias (ix. 39). The oracle of Trophonios was situated at Lebadeia in Boeotia, and the shrine was of mysterious formation, somewhat similar to St. Patrick's Purgatory in Ireland. There was an artificial chasm in the earth, into which the suppliant was let down by a ladder. Once at the bottom, he saw a narrow aperture through which he TROPHONIOS 89 had to pass. Pausanias describes the descent thus : \" He lays himself on bis back on the ground, and holding m his hand barley-cakes kneaded with honey, he thrusts his feet first into the hole, and follows himself, endeavouring to get his knees through the hole. When they are through, the rest of the body is immediately dragged after them and shoots in, just as a man might be caught and dragged down by the swirl of a mighty and rapid river. , . They return through the same aperture feet foremost \" The gaseous exhalations, together with the potions and preceding rites, may be taken as an explanation of the supernatural phenomena, or, at least, of the stupefied state of the suppliant when he issued from the god's abode. The statue of Trophonios by Praxiteles had the characteristics of Asklepios, according to Pausanias, who also says that Trophonios and Hercyna might be taken for Asklepios and Hygeia. This resemblance, as in the case of Amphiaraos, shows a close connection with Asklepios, and also the prominence of medical powers in the cult. Medical consultations at Lebadeia dated at least from the middle of the fourth century B.C., and as at Epidauros, a sanctuary of Apollo stood near by. The ceremonies of incubation, given by Pausanias from his own experience, are as follows. First he gives the preliminaries to consulting the oracle : 1. The suppliant must pass a certam number of days in the house of the Good Daimon and Good Fortune. 2. He must submit to purification. 3. He must abstain from hot baths, and must bathe in the river Hercyna, 90 TROPHONIOS 4. It is probable that fasting was imposed. Ter\u00ad tullian says that fasting was appointed for those who were going to practise inculi.itian at the oracles, and in the Trophonios of Kratinos this line occurs: \"To take food or indulge in sleep is not allowed.\" In the same play three kinds of fish are forbidden. 6. He must sacrifice to Trophonios and various other gods- This was the general sacrifice, which was made also in the case of Amphiaraos, and from which the priest told if the god was propitious. 0. It was followed by the sacrifice of a black ram over the pit, to .Vganiedew, on the night before con\u00ad sultation. According to the inwards of this sacrifice, the priest decided whether the suppliant might go down to Trophonios or not. For the significance of the black ram, compare the similar sacrifice to Amphiaraos. When the sacrificial rites were satisfactorily ended, the real ceremonies of consultation began. 1. On the night of consultation, two boys, called Hermae, thirteen years of age, took the suppliant to the river Hercyna, anointed him with olive-oil, and bathed bim in the river. With this we may compare a ceremony practised at the Charonion of Aeliaraka, according to which boys and youths, stripped and anointed with oil, took a bull and led it to the mouth of the grotto. 2. The suppliant was taken to the two fountains of Forgetfulnesa and Memory, wherefrom he had to drink. The action of certain waters on men's minds was well-known to the aneienta. Philostratos (Vit. Apoll. ii. 37) confirms this ceremony and adds: \"I could TROPHONIOS 91 mention many famous oracles among Greeks and bar\u00ad barians, where the priest, after partaking of water, gives utterance to the sayings from the tripod.\" 3, The suppliant was shown the god's statue which was hidden from the vulgar gaze, and he did worship to it. The purpose which the ceremony served is clear. The god who appeared to the suppliant would be the same in form as the deity of the statue. 4. The suppliant had to put on a linen tunic, a ribbon girdle, and shoes, such as the natives wore. Philostratos says that the tunics were of white linen, and Maximus of Tyre (14. 2) says a red cloak was worn over them. Linen garments were considered to be favourable to dreams. Philostratos quotes Apollonios (viii. 7. p. 309) who always wore linen garments and had much intercourse with oracles and deities :\u2014\" It is a sign of purity to pass the night under a linen garment, and dreams too bring prophecies of more worth to such as live like me.\" The ceremony of wearing linen was probably introduced from the Egyptian cult of Serapis, according to Bouch^- Leclereq.^ Great care was observed in the matter of foot-wear, for shoes came in contact with the holy place and could not be used in ordinary life. Hence, as Frazer* points out, in many popular shrines a stock of old clothes and shoes are kept for the convenience of worshippers, who retiiiii them after their devotions are over. In the procession at the .Andanian mysteries in Me.-ienia,^ the sacred women were not allowed to wear ' BiMmrt <U la Divmalion, III, 321. > Dittenberger\u2014S^(o3e Ineer. Oraee. 388. 92 TROPHONIOS shoes, unless made of felt, or the skins of victims that had been sacrificed. Then came the descent into the sacrificial cave. Pausanias does not relate what took place during the interoourse vrith the god. He merely says : \" The future is not revealed to all in one and the same way, but to one it is given to see, and another to hear.\" In the De Genio Socratis of Plutarch (p. 22) we find a lengthy account of the senaations of one Timarehus who consulted the oracle, but even the author does not seem to put much faith in his story. It might pass for the wanderings of a chloroform patient. The last act that Pausanias relates before the descent is the holding of honey-cakes in the hands. These were to be thrown to the serpents at the entrance of the cave to appease them and allow the supphant to pass in safety. Philostiatos also records this proceed\u00ad ing. Honey-cakes were a usual offering to infernal deities. In the Aeneid (ii. 42) Aeneas throws them to Cerberus, to allow him to get past, and barley-cakes kneaded with honey were offered to Sosipolis, a native Elean spirit (Paus. vi. 20). The length of time after that act up to the suppliant's return to the upper regions varied, and the actual visions are unknown, but we can judge of the intensity of the experiences by the exhausted and stupefied state of the suppliant, who is said always to have returned in a state of fear and to have lost the power of laughter. Immediately after his return the priests made him relate his vision, and he was compelled to record it on a tablet to be dedicated to the temple. Then still in a state of teiTor, he was taken bock to the house of Good Fortune, where he was allowed to return TROPHONIOS 93 to his normal condition. Payment was also demanded by Trophonios. According to an insci-iption found at Lebadeia (C.I.G.G.S. 3055) all who consulted -the oracle had to pay a silver coin into the tieasury and offer ten cakes of the value of a drachma apiece. The same inscription gives a list of those who had done so. Vni. Incubation at the Plutonia and Oracle of Dionysos THE PLUTONIA.\u2014The worehip of Pluto as a medical divinity was a branch of the cult which developed in later times. The god of the lower world was the sender of death, and, consequently, in his hand lay the life of mortals. To bim they had to appeal when the dread of approach\u00ad ing death assailed them. Thia aapect of the worship of Pluto was probably imitated from the cult of the Egyptian god Serapis, and by Serapis Pluto was over\u00ad shadowed. In .Asia Minor his position was best assured. Strabo (xiv. p. 650) gives accounts of three centres of incubation which were called Plutonia or Charonia indiscriminately. After Strabo no other writer mentions them. The natural inference is not that they became extinct as shrines, but that the name of the presiding deity waa changed, and that Pluto was supplanted by Serapis whose fame was gieater. The firat of theac three Plutonia deacribed by Strabo was situated near the city of Acharaka, on the road lietween Tralles and Xysa, in the valley of the Maiander, where there was a giove and temple of Pluto and Kore, and a remarkable grotto, the Charonion, situated above the sacred grove. The god was con\u00ad sulted by sick people through the medium of priests, who lived m the village near the grotto, and with whom the suppliants lodged. These priests personally con\u00ad ducted the dealings with the deity. They practised incubation for the patients, and prescribed the cures PLUTONIA 95 according to their own dreama. Sometimes the patients were allowed to dream for themselves, but they always had recourse to the priests for the interpretation and for guidance how to act. The wide extent of the priesthood's power is the chief point to be remarked in this section of incubation. Their control over the suppliants waa well asaured, for they allowed no liberty of incubation, such as we have seen to be the rule in the temples of Asklepios. This new method was due to the infiuence of Egyptian incubation, and traces of it are found even in the Asklepios cult. Although Aristides usually performed the act personally and independently, he relates in the second of the Sacred Orations (p. 466) how his attendant had a visitation in a dream from the god, who gave him instructions for the proper regime which Aristides had to follow. Restnc- tions similar to those enforced at Acharaka were made in the Temple of Isis at Tithorea. Pau\u00ad sanias (X. 32) says that there was no admission to the shrine except for those whom Isis herself favoured with an invitation in a dream. He adds that the same was done by the nether gods in the cities on the Maiander, and that they sent visions in dreams to whomsoever they wished to enter their shrines. The second Plutonion in the valley of the Maiander, mentioned by Strabo, was at Limon, where there was a sacred cave said to reach to Acharaka, although many stades distant. It is inferred that the practices here were similar to those at Acharaka. The third was at Hierapolis. The neighbouring hot baths were connected with the Plutonion according to Strabo, a fact which shows that the consultations were 90 PLUTONIA frequently of a medical nature, so that the baths would form part of the treatment prescribed. The following account is given by Strabo (xiii. iv. 14) of this shrine of Pluto : \" The Plutonion is a small cavern under a crag of the overhanging hill, large enough to hold a man and of great depth. In front of it is a square enclosure, about sixteen inches in extent. This is full of thick misty vapour, so that the ground can scarcely be seen. The atmosphere is not injurious, if one goes round about the enclosure, for in calm weather the air is pure, and the vapour remains inside the precinct. But death comes at once to any living creature that enters therein. Bulls, that arc taken within, fall down and are dragged out dead, and we oureelves have sent m sparrows which fell down at once suffocated.\" Here, too, there were special ministers of the cult who acted, most probably, like the priests of Acharaka. Strabo tells that they alone were able to penetrate within the sacred enclosure without succumbing to the vapoure, a feat to be attributed either to antidotes or divine providence. DIONYSOS.\u2014From Pluto to the chthonian Dionysos ia a short step. Both belong to the infernal regions, and the two eultn have much the same aspect. Dionysos ia the symbol of the earth's powers, and is in close association with Apollo. .\\s son of the earth he acts by the chthonian mode of inspiration by dreams. At Eana in Macedonia (bete was a shrine either of Pluto or Dionysos, wherc the oracle worked by incuba\u00ad tion. \\\\'e learn this from an inscription of imperial times, given by Heuzey, in the Mission Archiol. de MacMoinc (luac. N, 120) :\u2014 DIONYSOS 97 \" To the god and lord Pluto, and to the city of Eana, T. Phlaonios Leouas, having seen the god and the temple, dedicated this tablet at his own expense ac\u00ad cording to a dream through Achcrontios, the curator.\" For the suppliant the god was Pluto, but the proximity of Thrace makes a connection with Dionysos very.probable, for in Thrace the Dionysian cult was all-prevailing. Here too, evidently, the priests or curators performed incubation for the suppliants. Similarly at Amphikleia, in Phokis, there was a medical oracle of Dionysos, where the priests practised incubation, and not the suppliants. Pausanias (x. 33) gives the following account of it: \" (At Amphikleia) rites are celebrated in honour of Dionysos. There ia no entrance into the shrine, nor any visible statue. It is said by the Amphikleians that the god prophesies for them, and rescues them from diseasi^. He cures through dreams the diseases of the Amphikleians and their Deighbours, and the priest is a prophet, and as a medium gives oracles from the IK. Incubation In the Cults of Isis and Serapis ISIS.\u2014In the religion of Egypt Isis figured as chief goddess, She was mother of Horoa, the sun-god and ruler of all, and wife of Osiris, while she herself was worshipped as supreme goddess of nature and magic arts. By her possession of deadly and life-giving herbs of the earth, and by her magic spells, she was arbiter of life and death, and thus one of her principal functions was that of healing. A tradition was maintained that Isis was the discoverer of the heaUng art, and that she appeared in dreams to her patients from the beginning of her activity as a goddess. Diodoros (i. 23) gives the following account of her faculties :\u2014 \"The Egyptians say that Isis discovered many health-giving remedies, and was gi-eatly skilled in medical science. Therefore, when she became im\u00ad mortal, she took special pleasure in the healing of mortals, and in sleep gave help to those who sought it, manifesting herself clearly and conferring benefits on thoae who begged for them. ;\\s proof of this they gave not myths, as the Greeks do, but plain facts. They say that almost the whole world is their witness, for men vie with each other in honouring the goddess for her healing v^itations. They say that in sleep she appears and gives help to the sick in their diseases, and heals in a marvellous way those who obey her. Many who had been given up by doctora on account of the gravity of their illness have been saved by her, and many who had lost their eyesight, or the use of some part of their bodies, have been restored to their former state when they have had recourse to the goddess.\" If the above account were to be taken literally, it would mean that the activity of Isis as an iatromantic oracle reached far back into the obscure centuries, and that incubation had been an Egyptian practiie from early tunes. The importance of the r6le of Isis in medical science cannot be denied, but Weleker' refuses to credit her with the position assigned by Diodoros. He considers that the priesthood established such a tradition at a late date in order to strengthen faith in the new practices of their health-oracles by fortifying them with the assurance of antiquity. He believes that only under the Ptolemies did Isis begin to rank as a goddess of healing, that is, when her cult became con\u00ad nected with the new god Serapis, It may be that then, for the firat time, the practice of incubation became general in Egypt, but as a healing goddess Isis had been honoured for many centuries before. In Ebers Papyrus, which dates about 170O B.C, references are found to Isis as a medical divinity. It contains for- mnliB by which she was to be invoked to save the sick aa she had saved her son Horos. A remedy is noted which was \" prepared for Ra by Isis herself, to rid him of headache.\" Such references as these show that the tradition given by Diodoros was no late invention of the priest\u00ad hood. Medicine had been a sacred science of long development in Egypt, and the coimeetion of Isis with it aa presiding goddess was an article of religious belief. But th^rigin of Egyptian incubation remains obscure. 'JiUitKSchriften,lU. pp. 97-100. 100 ISIB It is possible that it may have been introduced into Egypt from Greece. and adopted as an adjunct to the art already practised. This adoption would involve modificationa in the Greek method, for medicine was practised on other lines in Egyptian temples. In Greece, that is in the early times, temple-sleepers ex\u00ad pected special personal treatment with remedies for their own particular cases, but the Egyptian priests treated their patients according to fixed and unvarying prescriptions purporting to be of divine origin, and they would continue their original methods, while em\u00ad ploying incubation as an accessory. Hence it would seem that there were two stages in the development of incubation. In the first stage, Greek methods were introduced into Egypt, where they developed along national lines. The second stage came by the trans\u00ad ference of Egyptian deities to the Greek world, when the practices of Egypt influenced and modified the incubatiiin in Greek cults. Until about the seventh century B.C., Egypt was a vague geographical expresoion for the Greeks, but then travellera began to explore, and Egyptian oracles became known. The firat was Ammon at Kyrene, and there Isis also was worshipped. The cult of Isis was one of the few foreign cults that flourished in Greece. The goddess was introduced into .Athens and Corinth by trading merchants, and there her first temples stood. From an inscription found at the Piraeus, we learn of the erection of a temple to Isis before 333 s.c. This inscription is a decree granting land to the merchants of Citium tn raise a teniple to Aphrodite, for it was necessary to obtain j-wrmission from the Athenian demos, if a foreign god was to have a temple on ISIS 101 Athenian soil. The text ia as follows :\u2014\" The people have decided to grant the merchants of Citium the nght of acquiring a piece of land to found a temple of Aphrodite, in the same way as the Egyptians have founded the temple of Isis,\" At Corinth there was a similar early introduction of the goddess, and from Corinth the cult was carried to Phlius, but it was not until the time of the Ptolemies that Isis becajne a popular Greek diviniiy. The rapid and late growth of her cult was due to her conjunction with the new god Serapis, and together they were worshipped throughout the Greco-Eoman world as oneiromantic gods of great healing powers. They were the only two prophetic deities of Egypt that were successfully hellemsed. SERAPIS.\u2014An Alexandrian god, like his city he was Greco-Egyptian by nature- Bouch^-Leclercq' describes him as \" a Greek body haunted by an Egyptian soul.\" Various traditions strive to explain the origin of the god, which is somewhat obscure, and the account of his dual nationality. Tacitus and Plutarch agree in saying that the worship of Serapis began under the Ptolemies. They give the stoiy that an unknown god appeared to Ptolemy I. in a dream, and told him to seek his image in the Pontus. I'tolemy heard that at Sinope there was a sta.tue of Zeus-Hades which corresponded to the description. The Sinopians were compelled to yield the statue, and it became at Alexandria that of the new god Serapis. Thus Serapis would be a Greco- Alexandrian deity. But critics assert that Serapis must be an Egyptian god, the Asar-Hapi of Memphis, 102 BGEAPIB while Krall, in Tacitus und der Orient, reconciles the two theories by saying that Zeus-Hades was taken from Sinope by Ptolemy I, and then confounded with the Egyptian Asar-Hapi. A passage in the Anabasis Alexandri of Arrian seems to contradict this account. In Book vii. 26 we find the following:\u2014\"The king's chronicles state that Menidas, and Beleukos, sleeping in the teni|>lf of Serapis (at Babylon), asked the god if it were best for Alexander to be brought to the k-mple and to supplicate the god to heal him. And a voice came from the god saying that they should not bring him to the temple, for it would be better for him to remain where he was. These things his comrades reported, and Alexander died not long after, for that was after all for the best.\" The story, if correctly rendered, would imply that there was a temple of Serapis at Babylon, where incubation was practised in the time of Alexander. Some eritie-^, amount whom is Welcker, take it as a simple anachronism on the part of Arrian, but Krall asserts, that the god desiguuted m the passage is Bel- Zipur, a Baal of Babylon. This Baal was identical with Zeus-Hades of Sinope, who became Serapis. \\iid thus the god who played a part in the death of Alexander afterwards became the Serapis of Alexandria, so that there is no real toiuradiction of the theory. Serapis was presented to the world as an iiitromantie deity, working through incubation. His attributes and function were highly complex. According to Bouch^- Leclercq, \"under his nome were collected the debris of numerous divine personalities worn out by time,\"^ ' Op. eU. lit. 37S SERAPIS 103 He rose to be supreme as Zeus, and he is lauded by Aelius Aristides for the universality of his benefactions, for he benefited the soul by bestowing wisdom, according to that writer, and the body by bestowing health, while his readiness to grant requests made him so \\ridely popular. It was to his power of medical divination that Serapis owed the great fame he enjoyed. In this respect, as well as in his attributes and position in the theogony, he bears a close resemblance to Asklepios, and Isis is his accompanying goddess, as Hygeia figures along with Asklepios. The connection of the Isio- Serapic cult with that of Asklepios is shown in many ways. The deities are seen together on coins, their temples are in close proximity, inscriptions unite their names, and dreamers, such as Aristides, receive joint visitations from them. The temples of Isis and Serapis grew to surpass in number and fame those of any other god. .\\n.sTiiles mentions forty-two in Greece alone, and traces of the cult have been found in many distant countries. To this great vogue of the Isio-Serapic cult is to be attributed the extent to which the practice of incuba\u00ad tion spread in the Greco-Eoman world during the first centuries of the Christian era. The custom was of primitive origin as we have seen, but what we deal u ith now is the later growth, and it is to be remarked how the features of this later growth show the influence of Egypt. The two most promment characteristics which distinguish late from early incubation are the secrecy observed and the nse of the priest as a medium of communication with the god. Egyptian priests had their own way of making the god speak, and the hellen-104 SERAPIS ised oracles of Egypt carried on Egyptian methods in Greece. From the sanctuaries of the Egyptian gods they spread into Greek cults. The practices at the Plutonia in Asia Minor have already been noted, and in turn Egyptian influence is plainly marked, when we compare the two. The most magnificent Berapeum in Egypt was at Alexandria, but we have no account of ite healing work\\ Strabo speaks of the sanctuary at Kanobos, one hundred and twenty stades from Alex\u00ad andria, in the following passage (xvii. 1,7):\u2014 \"At Kanobos ia a temple of Serapis, which is venerated with deep reverence, and which brings to pass cures so that even most distinguished men heUeve and themselves practise incubation, or do so through others. Some inscribe the cures, and othera the virtues of the oracles of the place.\" We note here, as always in the later incubation, the position of the priest as intermediary between the suppliant and the god, for, judging by the practices at other temples of Serapis, we conclude that the inter\u00ad mediaries mentioned in the passages must be membere of the priesthood, appointed for the purpose. This view is confirmed by what we know of the customs at Memphis, where stood the oldest Egyptian temple of Serapis. An inscription given by Egger in the R^vue Archdologique (1860) proves the existence of an incubation-centre there. It is as follows ;\u2014\" I, Aristyiles, dedicated this lamp-lighter, considering that I fare ill at the god's hands, for though I have followed the dreams of the temple, I have not been able to obtain health from him.\" An account of dreams given at this oneiromantic oracle of Memphis is found in a papyrus (Letronne, SERAPIS 105 Papyri Grecs du Loui-re) where a Greek, who had long been in the service of the temple, has written a kind of journal. It dates from about 164 A,D., and the writer is supposed to belong to the guild of professional mediums, who practised incubation for the suppliants, and who were called Katochoi, They were an institution at Memphis, and traces of their existence are found at other oracles. Pausanias (x. 33) speaking of the iatromantic oracle of Dionysos at Amphikleia says;\u2014 \" He communicates cures to the Amphikleians and their ne^hbours in dreams. The priest acts as the god's mouthpiece and gives oracles as a katocbos.\" The word is used to express the idea of a person possessed or inspired by a divinity so that his state and function were similar to that of a modem medium. Such were the priests at the Plutonia, and in the temple of Asklepios it has been noted that the priests some\u00ad times acted in this way. The only full account which Pausanias gives of the Isio-Serapic cult in Greece is in connection with the temple of Isis at Tithorea. It was the chief sanctuary of Isis in Greece, and it is to be inferred that Serapis shared in the worehip, for inscriptions have been found at the place, attesting the sale of slaves to Serapis. The following in his description (x. 32) : \u2014 \" About forty furlongs from the temple of Asklepios is an enclosure and shrine of Isis, the noblest of all the sanctuaries made by the Greeks for the Egypt^n goddess. For the Tithoreans deem it unlawful to dwell round about it, and there is no admission to the shrine save for those whom Isis herself has favoured with an invitation in a dream. The same thing is 106 SERAPIS done also by the nether gods in the cities on the Maiander. They send visions in dreams to whom\u00ad soever they w iah to enter their shrines. In the teiritory of Tithorea, festivals are held twice a year in honour of Isis, one in spring and one in autumn. Two days before each festival, the persons who are free to enter the shrine clean it out in a certain secret way, and whatever remains they find of the sacrificial victims, which were east in at the previous festival, they always carry to the same spot and bury there. The distance of this spot from the shrine we judged to be two furlongs. That is what they do to the sanctuary on the firat day. On the next day the hucksters set up booths of reeds and other improvised material, and on the last of the three days they hold a fair for the sale of slaves and all kinds of cattle, also garments aud silver and gold. After noon they betake themselves to sacrificing. The richer people sacrifice oxen and geese, the poorer folk sacrifice geese and guinea fowl. But it is against the custom to use swine, sheep, and goats for thia sacrifice. Those whose duty it is to burn the victims and bring them into the shrine must wrap the victims in bandages of linen, either common or fine linen; the mode of dressing them is the Egyptian. All the animals sacrificed are led in procession. Some convey the victims into the shrine, othera set fire to tho booths in front of it and depart in haste. They say that onco, when the fire began to bum, a profane fellow who had no right to go down into the shrine, rashly entered it out of curiosity. The whole place seemed to him full of spectres, and scaroely had SBEAPIS 107 he returned to Tithorea and told what he had beheld when he gave up the ghost. I have heard a similar stoiy from a Phoenician, He aaid that the Egyptians hold a festival for Isis at the time when she is in mourning for Osiris, At that time the Nile begins to rise, and it is a common saying amongst the natives that it is the tears of Isis that cause the river to rise and water the fields. At that season, I was told, the Roman governor of Egypt bribed a man to go down to the shrine of Isis at Coptus. The man who \\\\as thus sent returned from the shrine, but after he had told all that he had beheld, he, too, immediately expired. Thus it appears to be a true saying of Homer that it is ill for mankind to see the gods in bodily shape.\" In the above passage the prominence of Egyptian ways is noteworthy. Admittance to the ahiine was a apecial privilege, regulated nominally by the goddess who would act through her j^ervant the priest. Sacrifices were offered in the Egyptian fashion, and the secrecy of the shrine, as well as the punishment con\u00ad sequent on profane curiosity, was in accordance with Egyptian ideas. The same idea of mystery is found in another passage of Pausanias (ii- 13), where he tells how at Phlius, while the statues of Dionysos and Apollo were open to view in their temples, the image of Isis was only to be beheld by priests. PART n. Incubation in Christian Churches during the Middle Ages I. &itroduction IT ia probable that Christianity in supplanting paganism found the work comparatively easy so far as the Olympian go^ were concerned. Their aloofness from the practical affaira of man tended to alienate their worshippera, and it was a simple matter to cast off allegiance- A harder task awaited the new religion when it sought to d^possess the chthonian deities whose general beneficence and gifts of healing had bound them closely to the people. Worshippers were attracted and their devotion intensified by tangible benefits conferred and help given in times of stress. The faith thus practically engendered ajid rewarded proved a stubborn barrier to the onward march of Christianity. Paganism made its last stand in the temples of Serapis and Asklepios, and their powers of resistance were due to the cures performed under their auspices in the name of the god. In this struggle for supremacy over the ancient deities, the followera of Christ met the pigans on their own ground and adopted their tactics. Temples were replaeed by churches, where Christ was worshipped aa 110 INTRODUCTION the Benefactor, the Saviour, and thi Healer of mankind. These became centres for health-cures, wrought by Christ through some one of His saints, whose per\u00ad sonality varied according to the district, and miracles of healing were performed in such great numbere as to ensure the popularity of the churches. It is thin side of Christian work which shows most clearly the influence of paganism. Many of the ancient customs were retained because they were found to be the best means to the end, but they were covered with a transparent mask of Christianity, It was no longer the deified heroes, known as chthonian gods, that were honoured as miracle-workers, but Chri-..tia!i ^ints, who had been pre-eminently virtuous men, and after death had received the semi-deification of sainthood. Still there was no great gulf between the two types of agents. The methods were so similar, as vrill he shown later, that we are led to regard the saints as successors of the heathen gods. This point of view receives strong support from Deubner.' He traces a connection between St. Cosmas and St. Damian, the chief doctor-saints at Constantinople, and the Dioscuri, who formerly had an incubation-temple in the same place, and with whom St Cosmas and St. Damian were confounded by Greek client^j. In Egypt St. Cyrus and St. John supplanted, according to the chronicler, a local demon Menuthes, who is identified by some with Isis. It is no far-fetohed conclusion to suppose that the similarity in ideas and practices of such churches and temples arose from a Christianising of the pagan shrines and the retention of the former methods in order to suit the customs of the clientele. ' Dt /ftcufc. oh. Iv. INTRODUCTION 111 Owing to the indefiniteness of the records with which we have to deal, the question of chronology is left in a somewhat vague state. Roughly speaking, the first ten centuries of the Christian era form the epoch of the miracles which are detailed afterwards. The majority belong to the sixth and seventh centuries, but there are similar instances in the tenth and in the third and fourth centuries, so that in point of time the practices were continuous. There is no gap, lint rather an overlapping between the two periods. While the Catholic Church sought to enforce unity, she could not check the tendency to local variations. In the narratives of the saints' works, God is acknow\u00ad ledged as chief over all, and as the source of the miracles, but since prayer was made to the saint as intercessor, he naturally became identified with the deity, and his was the prominent place as protector and patron. Local characteristics and superatitions figured in religion as much as in the times when each district had its own patron\u2014Zeus, Athena, or Artemis. The great difficulty which the student of religious practices encounters is the legendary character of the chronicles from which he has to draw his information. It is impossible to take any particular story as tlie basis of a theory. It may really be a tradition con\u00ad cerning some heathen god which has been transferred to the saint; or even if the story ha^ been founded on historical events occuning in Christian times, yet by reason of exaggeration and amplification it may be unreliable. The most trustworthy chronicles are, of course, those of personal experiences, but here again inaccuracy arises from the subjectivity of the writer's point of view. He does not profess to write a statis-112 INTRODUCTION tical or exhaustive account of the saint's doings. He gives a series of narratives, selected according to hia personal opinions and aims. This subjectivity is most evident in the account of St, Fides by Bernard of Angera.' He relates only a few instances to illustrate the medical side of her work, preferring the stories which show how quick she was to punish wrongdoers- Prominence is given by all writera to cases of con\u00ad version, and to the care which the saints bestowed on men's souls aa well as on their bodies. Although it is impossible to assert the exact extent of the medical department in the Christian churches' work, yet there is sufficient proof that the custom of incubation was a widespread and popular one during these later centuries, as it had been in former times. It can be traced throughout Europe, and in Asia Minor and Egypt, flourishing in all parts as did the cult of Serapis. The number of churches at Byzantium, in which this custom was carried on, is large, for this city where the Dioscuri and Amphiaraos had healed the sick was made the metropolis of saints. We know of six churches of St. Cosmas and Ht. Damian; the famous church of St. Michael stood at Sosthenium, a suburb; the churches of Ht. Cyrus and St. John, and of St. Therajxin, were all situated at Byzantium, and all were famous for health-cures through incubation. St. Cosmas and St. ]!)anuan were worahipped in many parts of the world. Especially renowned were their churches at Rome and at Kaufburg in the country of the Suevi, and througlmut Gaul \\arious of theu: relics were cherished. St. Cyrus and ^^^t. John, another pair of medico-saints, had their chief church near 'St. f'tiff -Ed. A, BouiUot. INTRODUCTION 113 Alexandria, a great centre for the healing of the sick. St, Michael's cult pervaded all Europe, We know of incubation in connection with it both at Rome and Byzantium, In Asia Minor, too, the archangel was popularly worshipped, and at Seleucia in Isauria we find St Thekla working through incubation. In Gaul various saints were cherished as patrons and physicians. Gregory of Tours tells of incubation in connection with St. Martin' at his church in Tours, and with St. Julian' at Arvernus; and we have records of St. Fides' at Conques in Eouergue, and of St. Maximinus^ at Triives. In Britain, too, there are traces of the prac\u00ad tice of incubation. Bede tells how St. Peter appeared to Archbishop Laurence at Cambridge, in the church of St. Peter and St. Paul, which had been built by Aedelbert in 613, and was oi high authority in the land. The passage'' is as follows :\u2014 \" When Laurence was about to leave Britain, he bade a bed be prepared that night in the church of the blessed apostles, Peter and Paul, in which after many teara and prayera to the Lord on behalf of the state of the church, he laid his limbs to rest, and the blessed chief of the apostles apiwared to him.\" Thia is clearly a case of incubation where the supphant wishes to consult about a difficulty. Also, we read* that in the same church a paralytic was cured aa he slept at the tomb of St. Letard, who was buried there. Thua from Britain to Asia Minor, in Gaul, ' Dr. VirtiillbuA H Marfmi. Ecclii. ii. 6 'ActaSand. (ebr. iii. p. JTO. 114 INTRODDCTION Germany, Italy, Greece, and Egypt, the practice of incubation waa prevalent. The methods of the later period of pagan incubation are found to a great extent unchanged at the shrines of Christian saints. The prominence given to vigils and prayers is noteworthy. Fasting was often combined with them, as they were jierformed at the tomb or before the image of the saint. The ritea by which pagan suppliants were prepared for incubation went on the same lines, and produced a similar state of mind. Three kinds of incubation must be distinguished. First, there is incubation in the voluntary sense, when the suppliant, after some preliminary ceremonies, lies down in the church with the intention of sleejnng and receiving a visitation from the saint whom he has invoked. Second, when the suppliant falls asleep, sometimes, it is stated, by chance, and at other times the saint is said to send sleep to him, and while asleep he has a vision which gives him the help or guidance required. This may be termed involuntary incubation. Third, when the suppliant, by fasting, vigils, and prayers, gets into a certain soporific state of mind and has a divine visitation. This third class figures largely at the shrines of saints; but whether the cures are to be attributed to self-suggestion, hypnotism, or divine interference is an open question. Miracles brought about in these three ways are per\u00ad formed by the aamt at his shrine or in his church. The methods ai-e not naturally exclusive. The prac\u00ad tices were carried on side by side in the same place and in the name of the same saint, and it is often diflScult to distinguish in which state the miracle has happened. Ancient writers laid no stress on such INTRODUCTION 115 differences, and did not seek to draw the distinctions or to mention if the suppliant were sleeping when he was cured. Some cu^es, however, are always found to correspond to the ancient types of paganism. As in the heathen temples, the visions are of two distinct classes. First, there are visions during which the patient is healed by the saint: either an operation ia performed or a healing hand is sufficient, and the sick man wakes up cured. Second, the celestial visit\u00ad ant appears and gives directions for the cure. He may prescribe a remedy or order a certain mode of action. A third kind of miracle which frequently occurs may be included in the firat class, but owing to its indefinite nature it is unimportant for our subject. The patient is often said to be healed merely by presence iu the holy church. These are the instantaneous cures which are characteristic of modern miracle centres such as Lourdes. The firat class of miracles contains cases which form remarkable parallels to the narratives of the Epidaurian inscriptions. For example, the cure of the dropsical woman in the Encomium of St. Therapon (\u00a720), which is given in detail further on, recalls forcibly the works of Asklepios. Also, in the miracles of St- Cyrus and St. John (No. G2), an incubation patient, passing the night in the church near Alexan\u00ad dria, describes a scene which resembles the story of Karion in the Ploutos of Aristophanes. The majority of visions belong to the second class. Prescription-cures were the chief feature of the later fsgan period, and the predominance was continued in the Christian churches. It is noteworthy that the remedies have in most cases a clear symbolic signifi-116 INTRODDCTION cation. As iu the temples of Asklepios sacred ashes were ordered to be taken from the holy altars, so the suppliant to St, Therapon or St. Cyrus had to cure himself by the application of wax from the chureh candles or lamps. The general character of the diseases cured is the same as that given in the pagan records. The accounts are not exhaustive, so that htati.sties would be useless, but the prominence of blindness, lameness, and para\u00ad lysis is striking. The saints are not baffled by \" in\u00ad curable \" diseases, but t[u-M: are rather their speciality. A special feature of Christian churches was the cure of demoniacs. People with certain symptoms resem\u00ad bling those of epilepsy or lunacy were believed to be possessed by evil spirits, and were taken to the hoiy church, where the demons would be driven out by the Saviour. The belief in actual demoniac possession was so firm that writers say they saw the evil spirits leaving the man when the saint drove them forth. Whether we identify demomaca with lunatics, or hold with antiquity that there was a special irruption of otherwise bodiless spirits, the fact to be dealt with is that Christian churches became an asylum for people so afflicted. The Canons of the Fourth Council of Carthage (90-92) show that the cure of demoniacs was a regular practice in the churches. The exoreists were bound to lay their hands on them each day, while they lived in the church and had to sweep it out daily. The temples of .Asklepios and Serapis became, as we have seen, health-resorts where crowds of invalids and valetudinarians stayed, waiting for restoration of health, during an indeBnite period which sometimes extended to years. Some churches of the saints-INTRODUCTION 117 developed into similar establishments. It is clear from many of the records that sick and infirm people came for a sojourn at the church with the intention of waiting till they were cured. The length of their stay might be weeks, months, or years. Such a system of residential patients implies the maintenance of a large establishment. Hospices and baths adjoining the churches are frequently mentioned in the narratives, and great crowds came to invoke the saints, filling the hcffipiees and sacred buildings, The presence of demoniacs, too, must have necessitated further accomo\u00ad dation. We read of a demoniac chained to a stair\u00ad case in the church along with many others, waiting for divine aid.' In these eatabliahmcnts, which must have resembled the temple buildings at Epidauros, with the chnrch as centre, servants, attendants, and religious officials would have many duties to fulfil, and in the more important churches their numbers must have been great. Mention of attendants on tlie sick and the demoniacs is made occasionally, and church officials figure in some of the stories. The priests or monks had naturally the important role, taking the part of the pagan priests. The absence of scepticism in the records, all of which are written by devotees, prevents us from gauging the extent of their duplicity or getting any clue to their contrivances. The question of the genuineness of the miracles must be left aside. The stories show us the priests discharging three functions. First, they are caretakers and attendants of the sick and insane. Second, they act as inter\u00ad mediary priests, praying for the afliictc'd and by their intercession obtaining healing for them. Likewise ' Sl. Maximinui, \u00a77. 118 ISTRODCTCTION they perform the usual church services. Third, they are exorcists of demons. At the church of St. Maximinus this function is prominent. The \" Brothers\" act as exorcists and pray for the departure of evil spirits. Presumably similar work was done at the church of St. Therapon, where demoniacs were taJion in charge. n. St. Cosmas and St. Damian i and Damian' suffered martyrdom at Aegae iu Gilicia in the third century A.D. According to the tradition, they were doctora of Arabian race who tra\u00ad velled over the world curing the sick and preaching Christianity. In the consulship of Diocletian and Maximianus in 2S7 A.D., they were put to death and buried at .Aegae. Soon afterwards their bodies were transferred to the neighbourhood of Cyrus in Syr^. The chief church of these saints was at Constantinople. It was already famous in 516 A.D. Procopius relates that Justinian was cured in this church, which he thereafter restored. It waa built in the time of Theo- dosius Junior, and was situated in the Zeugma or Ceraticum. Gregory of Tours* gives a brief r^sum^ of the saints' powers and methods in the following passage :\u2014 \"The twins, Cosmas and Damian, doctora by pro\u00ad fession, they became Christians, dispelled the infirmities of the aick merely by the merit of their virtues and by the intervention of their words. After suffering various torturer, they joined the immortals and showed many miracles to men below. Any man who prayed, inspired by faith at their tombs, at once received medical treatment. Some say that they appeared in vision to the sick and told them what to do. If these carried out the advice, they went away cured- I have heard many particulars, but I think it ^ Acta Sonet, iv. Sept. p. 438-499. ' Lib. in Oloriam Martyr. \u00a797. 120 ST, COSMAS AND ST. DAMIAN would be tedious to give them, and I consider that what I have said is sufficient. All who prayed in faith departed healed.\" The miracles of Kt, Cosmas and St. Damian which are recorded were wrought in the church at Byzan\u00ad tium. The author is unknown, and the date of the writing cannot be ascertained, but it belongs to either the sixtli, fifth, or fourth centuries A,D. The resem\u00ad blance between theae miracles and the Epidaurian cures is so great that an attempt has been made to trace a connection betwcn the saints and the pagan god Asklepios, who was worahipped at Aegae. But St, Cosmas and St. Damian are localised as miracle- workers at Byzantium and not at Aegae, so that if any connection exist, it must be with some Byzantine god. Deubner' connects them with the Dioscuri who healed through incubation at Byzantium. Hesycbios Miles (15 E.H.G. iv. 149) says :\u2014\" The temple of the Dioscuri, Castor and Pollux, (was constructed by Byzas) on the altar of Semestri and at the confluence of the river, and in it release from suffering came to men.\" Dreams are not here mentioned, but in a scholium on Persius (ii. 56) we find :\u2014\" In the temple of Castor and Pollux, interpreters of dreams are usually kept to expound purely and clearly men's visions.\" Thus the temple must have been used for incubation. Further in tho same passage we read :\u2014\" When the Romans were suffering from a pestilence, Castor and Pollux told the people in dreams by what remedies they would he cured,\" The temple at Byzantium was in all probability used for rich people, like the temple at Rome. Further, ' De Ineub. p. 76. ST. COSMAS AND ST. DAMIAN 121 Deubner shows that the Greeks who cnnie to Byzan\u00ad tium were apt to consider St. Cosmas and St, Damian as their own gods, Castor and Pollux, A Greek is healed in tho church of the saints, converted by them, and shown his error in believing that he was being cured by Castor and Pollux. This relationship between the pagan and Christian twin-doctors can only be sug\u00ad gested, for there is no positive proof that St. Cosmas and St. Damian took up and carried on the work that the Dioscuri had been doing in Byzantium. As we study the miracles in detail, we see the deep imprint of paganism in the practices. The theory waa Christian. aainta, Cosmas and Damian, were con\u00ad sidered as Bubordinate^ of the most high (jod, with whom they interceded for men, and whose will they carried out. Repeatedly in the miracles they are described as the servants of God, and tJieir powers of intercession are frequently nientiuiieii. This theory of relationship to the Supreme Power is illustrated in an extract from the life of St, Theodore (\u00a773), Bishop of Galatia, where the worehip of Cosmas and Damian was popular, Theodore fell ill one day, and when despairing of recovery, he bad a vision of St, Cosmas and St. Damian. They promised to intercede for him with the King, when he explained his grief at having to leave his flock so soon. On their return, the saints brought with them a youth like an angel of surpassing glory, who said that the Lord and King was pleased to grant longer lease of life. He then departed, and St. Cosmas and St. Damian told Theodore to rise and care for the souls of others. Another cure, in which God was the central figure, overshadowing the doctor-saints, was wrought for a 122 ST, COSMAS AND ST. DAMIAN man who had an ulcer in his finger (\u00a7204). He went to the church at Byzantium seeking for healing, and there \"God manifested Himself invisibly to him,\" through the prayers and intercessions of Cosmas and Damian. The ulcer gradually healed. In the great majority of cases the saints appear alone as agents of God when invoked. Particulars of the visions are scanty, but in a few cases the appear\u00ad ance of the visitant is described. Naturally the dreamer saw them in the semblance of their images (\u00a7\u00a773, 219), or in the guise of some acquaintance. \" Cosmas came one day clothed in a cloak, in the likeness of Gaudioaus, a monk \" (\u00a7188). This monk, afterwards Bishop of Scythia, was known to the patient, and, he adds, \" I knew him well, since it was not an illusion, nor was I sleeping.\" Here is a clear case of a vision which came to the patient\u2014iTrap, i.e., in a waking state. In other cases the word \" invisible \" is used of the action of the sainte in healing. \" The saint laid a hand on his and thus invisibly healed him\" (\u00a7192), and \"God mani\u00ad fested Himself and declared Himself invisibly to him \" \u00a7204). The belief in a divine invisible presence ac\u00ad counts for these statements. But the most frequent visitation was that which came in sleep to a suppliant practising incubation. The church was the regular and official place for this incubation. \" Co&mas and Damian appeared to her in the church according to their custom in a vision \" (\u00a7198). and \" Since miracles of this kind were performed every liaj, constant crowds of sick people came to the church,\" i.e., at Byzantium (\u00a7192). A man w itii a fistula on the thigh was. after ST. COSMAS .\\XD ST. n.^Ml.^N 123 long suffering, advised to go to the church of Cosmas and Damian. They appeared to him at his home and said, \" Come to us. Thou wilt be healed.\" He obeyed, and hia cure followed (\u00a7176). In some cases presence at the church was not es.>,en- tial cither for a visitation or a cure. The recovery of St. Theodore through the help of the saints (\u00a773) took place at his home ; Justinus (\u00a7185) is visited and cured in Scythia; a Phrygian woman (\u00a7219) has visitations from the saint, and receives medical treatment. This last story is remarkable in several respects. Con- stantine, a soldier of Constantinople, married in Phrygia while at the wars. His wife suffered from an ulcerated breast. Constantine was a devout wor\u00ad shipper of St. Cosmas and St. Damian, and spoke of their healing powera to his wife. By night she had a visit from them, and they promised to cure her. When she awoke and described the apparition to her husband, he recognised them from her description which tallied with his images of St, Cosmas and St. Damian, A second and third time the visitation was repeated, and active measures were taken for her cure. During the second visit they asked the woman her symptoms, and told her to open her mouth. One of them put his finger in, and blood flowed out. In the morning she was cured. The third time they appeared they told her to anoint hereelf with wax from the light over her head, and she would suffer no ill thereafter. The medical treatment which these two saints gave was either of an active nature\u2014ranging from mere touch to a surgical operation; or it took the form of a prescription. In the above story both kinds of treat\u00ad ment figure. Instances of simple touch arc found in 124 ST. COSMAS AND ST. DAMHN \u00a7\u00a7 192 and 209. \"The saints laid their hands upon the man and cured him.\" A more complicated process is the surgical operation in \u00a7220, where the resultant scar is given as proof of the authenticity of the tale. Sometimes these accounts of miraculous feats of surgery performed on a sleeping patient by divine hands have a strong flavour of tradition, but although the details cannot be guaranteed, they are interesting for two reasons. First, they show that a certain sur\u00ad gical activity was commonly attributed to the saint?; and secondly, they form an interesting parallel to the ancient cures in the Epidaurian inscriptions. One of the most curious of these i~torie.^ is attached to thi church of St Cosmas and St. Damian in the Via Sacra at Rome. An official of the church had his whole leg consumed by cancer. While sleeping, he saw Cosmas and Damian approaching him with oint\u00ad ment and instruments, A curious conversation took place between the saints. One asked the other where they could get flesh to fill up the space made by the amputation. The other recalled the fact that an Ethiopian had that day been buried in the cemetery. They went and brought the dead man's hip to give to the sick man, and his hip they conveyed to the cemetery. The patient woke up well and whole. He told his story, and when tliey w.nt to the cemetery. they found that the Ethiopian had the patient's hip instead of his own, Another oixration f \u00a7189) was per\u00ad formed on a dropsical man. The fluid was allowed to run out, and then his body was healed up again. The second form of medical treatment was the pre\u00ad scription of remedies by the saints. The following ore a few examples ol then diitelie measures. A man ST. COSMAS .\\ND ST. DAMIAN J25 with hemorrhage was told to cease eating flesh and to eat cakes made with flour (\u00a7195). A woman (\u00a7198) received a prescription of herbs for a pain in her breast. She had to drink laser mixed with pennyroyal. She waa cured, but the writer adds, \"The virtue of the saints cured the disease, and she made use merely of the names of the herbs.\" The belief, therefore, waa that the power of the prescription did not lie in the healing properties of the remedies, but that the cure was wrought by faith. The relations existing between the lay-doctors and the churches, as centres of healing, were characterised by a spirit of rivalry. In almost every case the uniform statement is made that the doctors of medicine had been consulted, but that their skill had been of no avail. The sick man then had recourse to the divine healers, and iu so doing met with opposition from the regular practitionera. Sometimes the doctors are in\u00ad volved in the cures. A woman with an ulcerated breast (\u00a7216) refused to allow her doctor to perform the oiieration, and said she would consult St, Cosmas and St. Damian. He laughed and told her she would return in a worse state of health. But she went in faith. The doctor then had a vision of the saints, who told him to go to the church and cut the woman's breast at the pkce they indicated, and then to apply a medicament which they gave him. He obeyed, in contrast to his former mockery, but found that the operation had already been performed, so that he had only to apply the medicament. Again we read (\u00a7194) of the doctors being summoned to the church to cure an internal disease. Their efforts were unavailing, and then CosmE^ and Damian allowed the man to recover. 126 ST. COSMOS AND ST. DAMUN whereupon he gave thanks to the saints for his recovery, amidst the discomfiture of the doctors. One patient takes his doctor with him to the church as nurse-attendant iJ;209j. The saints appeared to him, and said they would cure his charge. This they did by mere touch, Another case (\u00a7216) occurs where the saints appeared to the doctor as intermediary, and another prescription (\u00a7195) is given not to the sufferer but to some [xirson who was probably a church-official. The victories of the saints over demons receive special comment. Evil spirits were regarded as the originators of diseases, and in healing men the saints routed the demons. A youth (\u00a7192) was reduced to debility by a demon and \"prayed night and day at the church to be released from the demon,\" The saints set him free. An ulcerated breast (\u00a7216) is attributed to a demoniacal attack, and similarly a church ofiicial is said to suffer from various diseases sent by a demon (\u00a7225). Sick people who visited the church were accustomed to await healing for weeks or months. Xo mention ia made of hospices or accommodation for the sick, but the church roust have resembled oiher establishments where cures were given, for St. Cosmas and St, Damian often tarried some time before they had piiy on the suppliants. One man (\u00a7175) lay for a year in the church, and miother (\u00a7225) spent seven months there before flie healers came to him. Funds must have been forthcoming for the maintenance of this hospital. The mercenary aims of the saints are not obtruded on our notice, although gifts acted as spura to the healere. A man, suffering from arthritis (\u00a7149), promised Cosmas and Damian a waxen offering and recovered his health. ST. COSMAS AND ST. D.'.MIAN 127 He forgot his promise, but was reminded by a return of his sufferings. He then fulfilled his vow, and at once was cured. More efficacious was the action of a woman who had a paralysed arm. She offered up a wax offerii^ and received healing straightway. At the chureh of the saints at Kaufburg in the coun\u00ad try of the Suevi, donations are a prominent feature in the miracles. These incidents are, however, of later date. The church was begun in 1496, and the first entry dates 1628. Pronaisea and vows were made in almost every case, and were various in nature\u2014masses, service, candles, tapers, images, and money. A story is given of two men who were both ill. While one pro- mi^d a gold ducat and received healing, the other made no offering and was not cured. in. St. Therapon The miracles of St. Therapon are recorded by a writer whose identity is unknown. Deubner,' reasoning from the style of writing, assigns the I'^nmmium to the beginning of the seventh century A.D. It thus would belong to the same period as the miracles of St. Cyrus and St. John by Sophronios, In two passages (\u00a7\u00a710, 28) we find a topical reference in which the martyr is entreated to help the Christians at this time of stress. \" Have pity now on the Christians hard pressed round about by the heathen, or, rather, share their troubles and save the city in which thou hast come to dwell \" (\u00a710). Byzantium was besieged by land and sea in Cy2(i A.D,, and the Persian king was at Chalcedou. There is every probability that this waa the crisis to which the writer refers, and the Encomium may date from this year. The account is a contemporary history. The stories are not drawn from tradition or historical data, but from present-day events. One miracle (\u00a724) was %vitne3sed by the writer himself along with many other people, and his aim throughout is to relate occurrences for which he can vouch. The general character of his work is thus summed up (\u00a71) :\u2014\" Great is the collection of stories before me, for from all quarters I have poured into my ears tales which do not mislead or attract the mind by a fine, narrative style. but which derive their credibility from the personal nature of the experiences. For our subject does not concern dead affaira, the antiquity of which permits the rci order to deal with what is past and gone in a 'De Incub., p. 1^. ST. THERAPON 129 persuasive rather than truthful manner. The miracles which we record have been wrought on living men.\" In addition to the two sources already mentioned, some of the stories may have been derived from records in the church. The Italian demoniac (\u00a712), who was cured, had his experience inscribed on wax tablets, in all probability according to a cii=toni of the place. The church where the relics of St. Therapon reposed was in Byzantium, but its exact site cannot be located. Therapon had been a Cyprian monk, then bishop, and had been buried in the island. But on the invasion of the Saracens, his relics were conveyed for safety to Byzantium, and plact^ in the church of the Mother of God (\u00a710). Among the many churches nf the Virgin at Byzantium, there was a famous one in the district of Blachernae, and evidence points to this as the site of the church of St. Therapon. A vague clue is given in the story of the demoniac (\u00a712). While sleeping somewhere in the district of Blachernae, he had a vision telling him to go to the church of the Mother of God, called Elaia. His cure, which took place there, is attributed to St. Therapon. The account is as follows :\u2014 \"A certain man of Italian nationality, Florinus by name, was possessed by a legion of demons, and was going to hurl himself down from the wall of Blachernae on to the ground. He was stopped by some people who noticed hia state of perturbation, and he was put under guard. When three hours had passed, he seemed to be rid of the demons, for his trouble was abating. Later he spoke sensibly to his guards, and when released from hia bonds, lay down quietly and was at 130 ST. THERAPON rest. About midnight a vision came to him giving this message : ' Go to the church of the Mother of God called Elaia. For there you will be healed of your affliction.' When day came, he ventured to tell the viaion, and he was conveyed by those whom he told of it. He had only stepped on the basement of the church when his body was wrenched and twisted, and he had a violent convulsion. Then be gave an un\u00ad intelligible shriek, and was much enraged against those who held him. Lastly, he fell down prone on the floor, and remained speechless for several days. As he fell down, the horrible demons were put to flight by the visitation of the martyr, just like a pig by a blow, and as they departed, they had the appearance of smoke in the air. So he was completely cured of his trouble, and gave glory to Him who had wrought the cure through the saint. He remained for several days, and reeeived in vision the assurance of his cure. Then rejoicing he set forth for his own people, and wrote on wax tablets the celebration of his trouble and his release,\" On analysing this story, we find that Florinus has converae with the saint three times. The first time he had been taken by his rescuera to a certain place, where he paased the night and had an incubation- vision. Thence the same people, obeying the instruc\u00ad tions of the vision, took him to a \" house of prayer.\" where he was cured by the saint. Thirdly, he had another vision assuring him of his cure. The name Elaia is unknown. The most plausible conjecture is that his rescuera were servants of the church, where It was usual to deal with demoniacs, and that all took place within the sacred precincts of the church of the ST. THERAPON 131 Virgin where St. Therapon was worshipped. The chapel called Elaia would thus be part of the great church of the Mother of God at Blachernae, This church became one of the famous centres of health- miracles at Byzantium. \" All who were physically dis\u00ad tressed or troubled in soul, or were wasted by periodic and violent fevers, and who betook themselves to this divine hospital, were first rid of their spiritual afliction, and so received physical perfection. For such I take to be (jod's method of healing. First he cures the sick man's soul, by which it is right that the body be trained, then to the body too he gives perfection, so that the completion be not faulty in any respect, but that the individual may again enjoy perfection, as from nature or a remodelling\" (\u00a719). This statement of the divine method in healing men's bodies is in accord\u00ad ance with the records of other saints. The aim of the martyr was \" to perfect souls day by day and bring bodies to perfection, ao that through him believers might attain to the perfect man \" (\u00a71). The practice of incubation at the shrine of St, Therapon, as related in the Encomium was of similar character to that at other churches. There are the usual two classes of miracles. First, the cases in which the cure is performed by the martyr, and, secondly, the cases in which the martyr appears and gives certain instructions for the cure. To the first class belongs the story of the dropsical woman C\u00a720), which is similar to some of the Epidaurian inscriptions and to one cf the cures of St. Cosmas and St. Damian (\u00a7189). \" A woman suffering from dropsy waa laid do^ in the place. She saw the holy man opening up her toes; then she awoke, for she had been asleep when she 132 ST. THERAPON was treated by the martyr. On awakening, she at once bent down to her feet, and saw below water mixed with pus and blood flowing from her feet like a stream. When this was once fully discharged, her body was free from disease and the dropsy had left her,\" Then the writer commente on the number of cases which rcceived like treatment from St. Therapon, and which he has not space to recount. Thus the relative pro\u00ad portion of the two classes of miracles cannot be deter\u00ad mined. .A dumb and paralysed man (\u00a721) al^o receives personal treatmt nt from the saint. He had a vi~,inii of the saint anointmg him with sacred ointment. On awakening he found himself cured. Another man who had an ulcer thought he was cured in sleep by the application of a salve. He saw the saint and awoke healed in the morning. Only one instance of the second kind of vision is related (\u00a716). A decarch of military rank, whose body was terribly distorted, had recourse to the saint and re\u00ad mained in the church for several days. Then he heard an \" unseen voice \" telling him to have himself onointed with olive oil \" by an official of my church.\" This was done, and the man was straightway healed. The mention of a church-official acting as ministrant to the sick is noteworthy. The use of the word \" unseen \" pointe to an incubation-vision, for it occura in other eases of the same kind. For example, in the miracles f^t St, Cosmas and St, Damian (\u00a7\u00a7192, 202) the epithet \" invisible \" ia applied to the miracle- worker; and when Timarchus consults the oracle of Amphiaraos,' he is addressed by \" some one not seen.\" Other ronuukable cases of miracles given in the i/Je(/rii, 5\u00ab..22,p. 091. ST. THERAPON 133 Encomium are the following. Theodores (\u00a716), a paralytic, lay in the church for thirty days. \" He saw the wonder-worker giving him bread and a goblet full of pure wine. He was rising up, as it seemed, to receive it, and leapt up; in truth, he started up shout\u00ad ing and praising God.\" It is clearly implied that thia cure was effected during incubation. The expression TO SoKtiy\u2014as It seemed\u2014is in direct opposition to iv UXijfti'p\u2014m truth\u2014i.e. a sleeping vision opposed to the waking state. Prolonged prc>sence in the church often preceded the miracle of healing. A woman, suffering from cancer (ST?), remained in the church continuously for forty days, fasting and lying on the ground. Then she was freed from the disease by the saint, in a mysterious manner, the writer says. A gradual cure was wrought on Anastasios (\u00a715), who had a withered hand. \" He reached the haven of peace (i.e., church of St. Thera\u00ad pon), and fixed his hopes upon the saint. For nine days his soul was calm, and so full and perfect did his body become, that when the feast of the Nativity drew near, he was able to work with both his hands.\" The length of the patient's stay in the church was variable. One man with a bent body (\u00a719) had to stay some time in the \" healing-house of the martyr \" before he was cured, while a second man suffering from the same complaint did not require to be long in attendance upon the saint (o'u TTOXXSV n-poo-eSpiwv iSi-qBij) but at once on entering he had pity shown to him, and departed healed. The writer records one miracle of which he was a witn^s (\u00a724). A man had been beaten by soldiers until he was half-dead. Late in the evening he was 134 BT. THERAPON taken to the church, and all wlio saw him, amongst whom was the writer, despaired of his recovery. \" But the martyr cured him during the night, and, when day came, sent him away healed, while we, seeing what had been done, were filled with wonder.\" One case of punishment (\u00a722) is found in the Encomium. \"Occasionally the saint gave affliction instead of health for the sake of salvation. For ex\u00ad ample, a woman came to the church to pray. She found there a little child possessed of an evil spirit which was being expelled from bim. The woman thought it was a jest and laughed. The saint sent the demon into her, and for five days she was posses-^ed, then she was cured.\" IV. St. Thekla St. Thekla' was worahipped at Seleucia, chief town of Isauria. Her life and miracles are recorded in two books by Basil, Bbhop of Seleucia, who was a special protege of the saint. She herself was of literary tastes, and the citation of a line of Homer by a patient won her favour so that she was willing to heal him (mir. 24). Naturally she encouraged Basil in his literary work. She appeared to him (mir, 16) when he was becoming negligent, and by look and gesture showed him how pleased she was with what he had already written. At other times (mir. 27) she would appear to him by night, and show him certain boolra that would help him in his work. This relationship and the impressionable nature of the man forcibly recall Aristides the Orator who received similar patronage from Asklepios. Basil firat gives an account of the life of Thekla, and of her connection with St. Paul. She settled in Seleucia, where Sarpedon, a Greek demon, had a strong hold on the people. She fought against his influence, and by her miracles gained the supremacy. After a life of usefulness the end came thus (Bk. I. p, 122):\u2014\" Living she sank down and entered into the earth. Thus glory was given to God through her, and the earth was rent for her. In that place the holy altar has been set up, and for all suffering and for all infirmity she sends forth from thence sources of cures so that the place is a medical centre for all people.\" ' Basitios\u2014De Vila ac Miraadis disae Theeiat. 136 In Thekla we recognise the Christianised Greek chthonian god. .\\ human being, after a life of special sanctity and beneficence, is shielded from ordinary death and enters into the earth, thereupon becoming deified. Thus it was with Amphiaraos, who, like Thekla, was believed to send forth his healing powera from the earth. Sarpedon, whom Thekla replaced, was also a chthonian god, associated with Apollo at Seleucia, according to Diodoros (32. 10. 2). Thekla did not succeed in completely suppressing Sarpedon, for mention of his activity is found in some of the miracles. The cure of Oba (mir, 2), a heathen woman with a lame foot, waa first attempted by Sarpedon, then achieved by Thekla. The conversion of the patient follows. Aristarchos, a sophist (mir. 26), is despaired of by all, but cured by Thekla. He is, how\u00ad ever, not converted from his impiety, but peraists in giving the honour to Sarpedon, who had told hini to have recourse to the martyr. For this ingratitude he apparently receives no punishment. A noteworthy point in St. Tbekla'a work is the absence of mercenary motives. No mention is made of payment exacted, or even of voluntary offerings, except in mir. 8, where it is stated that quantities of birds of various kinds were kept in the open temple- court. Among them were swans, geese, pigeons, aud Egyptian birds, which had been dedicated to the saint as viitive-offerings. It must be supposed that more valuable contrihutious were sometimes given, although not exacted, for the powera of St Thekla proved more than once of inestimable benefit to the community aa well as to individuals. When tho whole city (mir. 9) was afflicted with a disease of the eyes, and no remedy ST. THEKLA 137 could be found, the saint appeared by night to some one in the church, and ordered all to use the water of her sacred fountain. This effectually cured the city. Another time all the animals of the town were seized with a mysterious disease. Thekla caused a fountain to spring forth neat a little chapel sacred to her. By drinking this water the sick were cured. The sacred water again appeare as a remedy in mir, 22, when a horae is cured of paralysis by a draught. It is unquestionably a fact that incubation was prac\u00ad tised at the shrine of St- Thekla. It was the custom of the martyr to appear by night to supplants who had come to her church to sleep (mir. 24). Alypios, whose life was despaired of by doctors, had recourse to St. Thekla, and was saved in the following way :\u2014\" The martyr appeared by night to him, as is her custom with the sick, in her own semblance, and asked from what disease he was suffering and what he wanted.\" His answer in a verae of Homer\u2014\" Thou knowest, and why should I tell one who knoweth?\"\u2014conciliated the saint and she smiled, delighted both with the man and the verse. Giving him a small pebble from her hand, she told him to fasten it on his neck as a charm against disease. Alypios clasped it in his hand, but when he awoke his hands were empty. Then he thought he had merely had a dream. But the fulfilment came, for his son entered, a short time after, with a pebble of exactly the same description, which he had picked up by the way. His father seized it in both hands, and was cured of the disease from which he had so long suffered. Several of the miracles make express mention of the fact that the vision appeared to the suppliant in sleep. 138 BT. THEKLA but there is also a ease of a waking vision. The martyr (mir, 3) comes to the man when he is awake\u2014 wrap ovK ovap, A cure by touch ia described once (mir. 27). It is a personal experience of the author. He waa suffering from ear-ache, and thought he would be prevented from speaking at the saint's festival which was ap\u00ad proaching. But by night she appeared to him, took hold of his ear, and pulled it. Thus he was cured. The apparitions of St. Thekla seem more usually to have conveyed prescriptions of remedies. A woman (mir. 2) was ordered to rub herself with dust taken from the holy shrine, and Aristarchos (mir. 26) was told to anoint himself with the oil of the church-lamps. The sacred symbolism of the medicaments is evident. V. St. Michael The cult of St. Michael was one of the most widespread in Europe and Asia Minor. No com\u00ad prehensive record of the archangel's miracles exists, but attached to several of his chief churches are legends and tales which show that incubation had a prominent place in his worship. At Constantinople there were churches of St. Michael from the fourth century A.D. The most cele\u00ad brated of his shrines stood at the ancient Sosthenium, which came to be called JMiehaelium. Constantine the Great was advised in a dream to build it. The story of the apparition of St. Michael to Constantine ia given by Nicephorus Callistus.' The place got the name of Sosthenium from the Argonauts, who had been fight\u00ad ing against Amycus, king of that district. They had suffered defeat, when a man with eagle's wings appeared to them and prophesied victory. The pro\u00ad phecy waa fulfilled, and in gratitude they raised a shrine and statue at the spot in honour of the apparition, Thia was the shrine which Constantine visited. While he slept there, he had a vision of a man in the likeness of the statue, who declared himself St. Michael. When the Emperor awoke, he resolved to raise a church and altars to St. Michael, thus ousting the original pagan god. The identity of the latter cannot be positively asserted. The name was given to indicate a saviour god. Maury^ comes to the 50. Rtv. Arehid. ri. p. 150. 140 ST. MICHAEL elusion that the deity was either Apollo Jasonios or Serapis, but he has no sure grounds of proof- The utmost that can be asserted is that the god was of the nature of great medical divinities, and that incubation was practised at the shrine up to the time of Con\u00ad stantine, The temple, thus Christianised, became famed for apparitions of the archangel, and incubation remained a practice of the place. Nicephorus proceeds to teU how \"anyone incurring sore misfortune, inevitable danger, terrible suffering, or incurable disease, found most speedy relief, on praying there to the god. It was believed with good reason that the holy Archangel Michael appeared there, and made the place one of healing. Therefore the men of old called it Michaelium.\" A similar account of the cures performed there is given by Sozomenus,' who adds a particular example\u2014 the case of Aquilinus, a contemporary of his own. Aquilinus was suffering from a form of yellow fever, and doctors were powerless to effect a cure. He was unable to take food for a long time- \" When nearly dead, he ordered his servants to take him to the house of prayer, saying that either be would die there, or be rid of the disease. A divinity appeared to him by night as he lay there, and ordered him to mix with his food a drug made of honey, wine, and pepper. This cured the man of his disease. And yet, according to the terms of their profession, the hot potion seemed to the doctors to be opposed to the man's symptoms.\" The opposition to the divine healing methods on the part of the doctora ia to be noted. Another case, given ' JScdti. Hia., ii. 3. ST. MICHAEL 141 by Sozomenus, tells of the conversion of a doctor who, although he was a Christian, did not believe in the power of the Cross. He had a disease of the feet, and when he was in the church, a vision of the Cross came to him and he was cured. Thus he waa convinced of its power. The former instance is a case of in\u00ad cubation, where the deit} gives a prescription of medi\u00ad caments, which effect the cure, not because of their own power to heal, but through the divine virtue. The second case does not mention incubation, although probably the vision came in that way. In Asia Minor the chief church of St. Michael was at Chonae or Colossae' in Phrygia, where the arch\u00ad angel made several apparitions, according to the tra\u00ad ditions of tile church. Miracles were frequently wrought there, but no account of them is preserved. We know of the existence of a sacred fountain beside the church, which is always found in the cult of St. Michael. Similarly the church on Mt. Tumba,^ now Mt. St. Michel, in the north of France, was renowned for miracles of healing, in which a sacred fountain figured. Blind, lame, and deaf men, as well as demoniacs, were restored to full posaesaion of their powera at this church. Another legend of an apparition of St. Michael is connected with the church on Mt. Garganus* in Apulia. The archangel appeared and claimed the cave at the top of the mount as sacred to himself. It is believed to have been the site of the ancient oracle of Kalchas. There a church was built in the sixth century. Near 'ActaSanct. WL-jit vii,, hepl. vii., gxvii. 142 ST. MICHAEL by flowed the sacred fountain, to which a glass drinking-vcBsel was aJlaehed. By drinking from it fever patients were cured. In countless other ways, we are told, the sick were healed, but details are totally missing. This chureh on Mt. Garganus was a favourite resort of pilgrims, on whom were wrought many miracles, especially at the Feast of the Saint. An account of such a pilgrimage is given by Cavaglieri, writing about 1680. The miracles were still continued at that date, for he states that \" Almighty God docs not cease to honour the church of St. Michael with miracles\" (\u00a720), VI. St. Cyrus and St. John .\\ eulogy' of St. Cyrus and St. John, with an account of seventy of their miracles, was written by Sophronios, patriarch of Jerusalem- He himself died about 640 A.D., and in his narrative he often mentions as his intimate friend Bishop John of Alexandria, who held the see from 610-620 A.D. Sophronios left Egypt about 619, on the invasion of the Peraians, therefore his work must date in the second decade of the seventh century. Further, at a certain date the relics of the saints were transferred to Eome to save them from the depreda\u00ad tions of the Saracens. In the codex which records an account of the transference, the date is given as the reign of Honorius and Arcadius. This is evidently an error for Heraclius and Pope Innocentius, for at the time Sophronios wrote, it is certain that the relics of the saints were treasured at Menuthes, a village near Alexandria, and were worshipped there by all nations, as he often says. In 634, Egypt was occupied by the Saracens, and to thia year the transference, which cannot be disputed, may be assigned. Thus the work\u00ad ing of miracles at Menuthes cannot have continued long after Sophronios compiled his narratives. He expressly states (\u00a731) that he writes a contem\u00ad porary, not an ancient, history. \"We do not give a record of ancient miracles or an account of things which were done a long time before, so that we are not shielded by a lapse of time, and infidels cannot repudiate our stories. Nay, we write what has been ' Sophronioa, fit DiudtmSS. Ci/n el Johanjwt. Sjiicil Rom. liL 144 ST. CVRUS AND ST. JORN done in our own time, some of which things we our\u00ad selves have seen, and some we have heard from others who saw them. Also, the majority of those who were afflicted and cured still survive in our time, and behold the light of the sun, and are witnesses to our truth, and themselves relate with their own mouths these things for the glory of God and the honour of the saints- Some have gone to heaven and have been freed from the troubles of this life, after themselves telling their exiierieneea to many, and leaving aa trusty witnesses of our narratives those who aaw and heard.\" The miracles which he had to draw upon were, he tells us (\u00a731), like an unbounded sea, in which the seventy which he gives were but drops of water. This huge mass of material was not found in written records, for in \u00a71 he says :\u2014\" On account of a disease of the eyes I had recourse to the martyrs Cyrus and John, and stayed at their chureh. While beholding the multitude of euros, I was anxious to find records to tell of the works of the martyrs and to proclaim abroad some of their precious miracles. But I found nothing of this kind, except only two small homilies of Cyrillus, the great champion and herald of truth, and I was stimulated by on irresistible impulse.\" While claiming the originality of fir^t-hand narra\u00ad tives for his niiraiies, Sophronios allows that there is a parallelism between them and those of Cosmas and Damian. In S30 he mentions, after relating the cure of a paralytic, that a similar miracle was said to hove been performed by Cosmas and Damian, the co-doctors and co-inailyis of tyrus and John. Similarly the cures of a paralytie. a dumb woman, and a Jewish ST. CVRLS AND ST. JOHN 145 woman were found identical in the works of both. Sophronios gives his explanation thus :\u2014\" No one need be surprised if the saints perform the same miracles, for from one source, namely, Christ our God, Cyrus and John, aud Cosmos and Damian, drew their eurea, and each haa and honours one Master, Him who grants us the cures through them and works the many won- dera-\" But a great similarity in attributes and methods, as well as acts, would suggest that Cyrus and John were initiated in imitation of the great medical brothers, Cosmas and Damian, who, as healers of the sick, had priority of time as well as of name. The bodies of Cyrus and John had first reposed in the church of St. Mark. It is not known whether this church was at Alosandria or at Canopus, where the saints suffered martyrdom. In the reign of Theo- dosius Minor (\u00a724), Bishop Cyrillus transferred them to the village of Mi'nuthes, near Canopus, where a mighty demon had appeared, by name Menuthes. She was a woman in form, and began to prophesy and cure disease, or rather, says Sophronios, to tell lies and cause diseases by phantasies. Thus dreams had their part in the practices of Menuthes aa a goddess of heahng. She belonged, therefore, to the category of Greek medical divinities, who cured disease through incubation, and gave oracles. The connection with Isis has been suggested by Deubner.' An inscription^ speaks of an Isis of Menuthes, and Strabo* mentions the practice of incubation carried on near Canopus in the worehip of Serapis. An intimate connection must have existed between the cults. ' De Incub. p. l!ll. 'C.I.G. iii. 468:f6, = Strabo, XVII, !, 17, 146 ST, CVRUS AND ST. JOHN This demon, Menuthes, was working ravogcs among the Christian flock, and Cyrillus prayed for its destruction. By night as he slept an angel appeared, and told him to transfer the martyr from St. Mark's Chureh to the shrine of the holy evangelists, which the governor Theophilos had built in the village of Menuthes, where the heathen goddess was worshipped, Cyrillus, judging that the angel referred to the pair of saints as united together, transferred both Cyrus and John. Installed in the church at Menuthes, they put the demon to flight and left her shrine desolate. Her temple and altar were buried in the sand, and no mention is made of any resistance to the triumphant Christians. As in the supplanting of the heathen idol, BO in their work of healing, the saints were considered as repre\u00ad sentatives and subordinates of the Supreme Power. In mir. 1 they are called \" the only helpers after God,\" and in mir, 4 '' the mighty-doctore of the city to whom the Saviour had given their powers.\" In mir. 36 the saints promise the patient to intercede with (5od for his recovery, if he obeys them, and in mir. 42 they explain :\u2014\" We are not masters of the healing !irt . . Christ is dispenser and guardian . . we offer intercession for all alike, and Christ decide whom we shall cure.\" Thus in many cases a condition of cure is converaion to Christianity, Mir. 12 relates how a rich man, Julianus, was paralysed by a magic potion. He was a heretic, and for this double infirmity, moral and phy\u00ad sical , the martyrs effected a cure. His father appealed to Cyrus and John, and they visited the sick man often by night, telling him to join the Chureh of Christ. ST- CYRrS .KSD ST. JOHN 147 He was obstinate in refusing, but as his sufferings always increased, he yielded at last and confessed his error. Then he was heoled. Two cases are given (mir. 37 and 38) where the patient joins the Christian Church and is cured, but reverts to his former heresy. The saints are not tricked, but renew the illness, and the second cure is given only on condition of fidelity. Converts to Christianity were apparently the chief aim of their work. Their unmercenary nature receives frequent comment, and they share with Cosmas and Damian the epithet anargyroi. Men come to them after long and expensive treatment by ky doctors, to whom they have given all their money. Then they have recourse to the saints, \"doctors who demand no fees\" (mir. 6). A rich man and a poor one (mir. 24) are cured alike by Cyrus and John, \" powerful doctors who need not money, nor cure the sick for gold.\" In mir. 69 the case of a blind Roman is given, who had no money to pay doctors and, therefore, \" sought a doctor who would be skilled in medicine and yet not require money, and not only that, but who would support the patient.\" This he found at the church of Cyrus and John, where, as he lay at the door, he would be supported by the charity of visitors to the church. This practice of free cures was naturally detrimental to the prosperity of the lay doctora, and their opposition to the saints was only to be expected. The lay prac\u00ad titioners and the divine physicians formed rival camps, and the former mocked at the latter, refusing to believe in the efficacy of the divine power of healing. In mir. 15 Sophronios says that he will relate the cure, so that the doctors cannot mock at the powers 148 ST. CYRl S AND ST. JOHN of the saiiits, saying that some Hippokrates or Galen worked the cure ; and mir. 30 tells of a doctor who was a Christian, but refused to believe in the powers of the saints, asseiting that they cured by medical art and not by a divine virtue. The story of his confe^ion is then given. In the majority of cases we are told that the patient haa first been treated by the lay doctora, but that they have been unable to cure him. For example, Theodores has visited his doctors of the city. \" But as he went, so he returned, having gained nothing except the knowledge of their incapability. He knew that none of them were of any avail against his disease, and giving up hope of being released and saved by them, he turned to the martyra Cyrus and John, who are the leal helpers powerful to save, and he lay down in their shrine, awaiting their help\" (mir. 27). Although cures were performed at the church of Cyrus and John from unmercenary motives, voluntary offerings were naturally accepted. Thanksgiving in this practical manner cannot have been uncommon, although littie mention of it is made in this account by Sophronios. In mir. 29 a rich woman is cured, and we are told that she gave many oblations in token of her gratitude. .\\ rich man from Palestine was restored to health. \" He departed joyfully to make a temple for the saints at Charagmata, his native city, as he had promised, dedicating it to his --aviours \" (mir. 68). The speediness of his cure is exceptional, and the saints, or temple offlciols, unmerceuiiry though they were, moy have been influenced by the munificent promise, which had evidently been made to them boforehimd. In mir. 48 a Thoban receives healing ST. CVRUS AND ST. JOHN 149 and is told to go to his native town, plant a vine in the name of the saints, and share it with them. He had to bring their share to the temple each year to he divided among the sick. Offerings in money and kind would be necessary, for the church must hove been a costly establishment to mamtain, and we may conjecture from its prosperity that, though not exacte.l, they were forthcoming, and that, as in other churches, patients when cured did not fail to show their gratitude according to their means. Sophronios does not give any consecutive account of the establishment that was maintained at the church, but stray phrases in the miracles throw some light upon this point. We read in mir. 9 of \" the multitudes of rich people who lay at the shrine of the martyrs where all sorts of diseases were cured \" ; and of the baths of the saints which often figure in the cures, aa in mir. 47 and 52. In mir. 37 the suppliant had to sleep in \"the holy sacristy of the church, where all the visitors stay who cannot find another place on account of the crowd of sick who are within.\" The church was the place for incubation, and the sick people lay on mattresses or low couches, which are often mentioned as Stromnai or Stromata. The work which a crowd of sick people involved was increased by the length of time they remained in the church before receiving the cure. A few, such as the rich man in mir. 58, were cured at once, but it is more usual to find that the patient stayed months and years before the saints had pity on him. We find that this variation gives rise to complaint. A man, in mir. 42, was cured on the night of his arrival. Three women complained that they had been waiting 160 ST. CYEDS AND BT. JOHN a year. Why cure the newcomer and not them ? The answer of the martyrs has already been given\u2014^that Christ decides whom they should cure. In mir. 48 the man dwelt at the church for two years, and mir. 69 gives the case of a blind man who remained for eight years at the temple-door and then recovered sight. A reason is given for delay in curing. The lapse of time would attract the attention of more people, and a greater number would be informed by the miracle (mir. 41). It stands to reason that there must have been a regular staff of attendants, membera of the priesthood, probably, who were kept busUy employed in earing for the sick. Only once do we find express mention of them. In mir. 56 we are told that the patient gave no little trouble to those who had the task of caring for the sick people in the church. Further, we often find mention of an oikonomos, the head official of the church, and of a deacon, his subordinate, who would both be under the bishop. Servants were also necessary for menial tasks. In mir. 49 a man has tried to defraud the church of offerings entrusted to him to deliver. A demon is ^eiit into him as punishment, and he is kept as a temple servant, and has to clean out the church twice daily. The record of miracles by Cyrus and John leaves no room for doubt that incubation was practiced in the worship of the saints. In the majority of the cases we find special mention of the fact. The patient is often described aa sleeping before the tomb of the saints when the vision appeare, as in mir. 42; or it is said that the saints led him to sleep (mir. 21) so that he might have a vision. And sometimes, as in ST. CYRDS AND ST. JOHN 151 mir. 34, the suppliant, after weeping and praying the greater part of the night, is sent to sleep by the saints in order that they may visit him. Further, in mir. 62, we have a close parallel to the vision of the incuba\u00ad tion patient in the Ploutos of Aristophanes. While passing the night in the church, he saw the martyrs going through the lines of sick people and approaching each individually and giving cures to each. It was a custom for women who desired offspring to betake themselves to the Asklepieia, and a similar custom seems to have prevailed at the shrine of these aainta. For a woman, praying for her aon, says (mir. 34), \" Other women who have not children and have re\u00ad course to thee, bear offspring.\" The visions which came to the sick in the church of St Cyrus and St, John were of two kinds. First, those in which the saints appeared and performed the cure- Second, those in which they prescribed a remedy, which the patient on awakening applied. The former class contains few ci^es. No surgical operations are performed, A demoniac (mir, 14) had a vision of the saints as he slept in the church, and was told by them to rise and go home, for they had driven away the evil spirits. Cases which belong to this class generally contain a statement to the effect that they are exceptional. A blind man (mir. 69) had his sight restored thus :\u2014\" They touched his eyes and did not order him to use medicaments.\" Similar statements are the following :\u2014\" They did not perform this through a vision, or give orders as was their custom to do, but when they had decreed that the boy should be cured, his cure was performed openly\" (mir, 41). \"Nor was he bidden do something, as are all sufferers who 152 ST, CYRUS AND 8T. JOHN stay in the temple because of their diseases; neither did be eat anything, or bring anything out by hia month; he only saw the saints after his recovery, and they said, ' See, we have rescued you from your sufferings, and you no longer suffer as you have done up to now.' \" In the first class comes the ease of a woman (mix. 33) who, when on her way to the church of St, Cyrus and St. John, fell from her ass and broke her bones- She recognised this to be the work of an evil spirit, and determined to continue her journey to the shrine. When she arrived, the saints appeared to her by night as doctors. She said to them that it was bard that they who were healers of the sick should cause her this disaster when she was in good health. He who seemed to be master and leader, viz., Cyrus, smiled and said to his pupil to come and free her. The pupil struck her on the cheek. She thought that some one had really struck her, but on returning to consciousness, found the vision fled and herself healed. In this case sleep is not expressly mentioned, but the word imp, really, implies its opposite 6yap, so that it is an incuba\u00ad tion vision. Another kind of visitation is a compromise between the two classes. The saints appear, and are supposed themselves to give the remedy to the sick person. One man received a dried fig to eat, during a sleeping vision, but on awakening he was surprised to find he had no fig in his hand. However, one waa discovered in the bed. This he ate, and was cured. Elpidio (mir. 2.^1 was given a myrtle in wine to drink. After she awoke, she drank it, and was cured- Isidores (mir. 4) was visited, not in a dream but in a waking vision, ST. C^RrS .^ND ST- JOHN 153 by the martyrs, and given a piece of lemon, which cured him. Punishment was given to Mennas (mir. 39) in sleep, and he awoke to find himself racked with pain and \"as if he had been really (Swap) beaten, he had weala which testified to the martyr's will.\" The second class of miracles is by far the greater, and the divine prescriptions which are detailed show much variet}, As we have previously noticed, especially in the miracles of St. Cosmas and St. Damian (\u00a7198), the medicaments were not considered aa powerful to heal in themselves, but as a means for conveying the virtues of the saints. A demoniac (mir. 57) is freed from the evil spirit by applying a prescrip\u00ad tion given to him by the saint--. The prescription waa to anoint h^ body with roasted calf's fleah, pounded down among wine. \" The evil spirit did not flinch before the medicament; it was the decree of Cyrus and John that it f^red.\" The remedies prescribed were, then, merely symbols, and of these symbols sacred wax and sacred oil are the most frequently used. Fifty per cent, of the prescriptions contam one or other of thoae aacred emblems. A plaster is prescribed for scrofula (mir. 1) to be made of sacred wax mixed with bread. Again for indigestion (mir. 1) oil and wax were to be taken from the church. For a broken leg (mir. 3), for deformities of the limbs (mu-- 7, 22, and 50), for gout (mir. 36), oil and wax from the temple lamps had to be used as an ointment. A was-salve (mir. 70) made from one of the candles on the sacred tomb is prescribed for a disease of the eyes. In other prescriptions we find various ingredients. A plaster made of honey and aisamos mixed with 151 ST. CYRUS AND ST. JOHN biscuit (mir. 6) is given for a fistula on the thigh, and again for the same complaint, citron leaves (mir. 61). A case of cataract (mur. 51) is cured by the application of Bithynian cheese with wax. Biscuit ia prescribed for dropsy (mir. 20). A woman fell and hurt her hand (mir. 9), and waa told to sponge it with mareotic wine and apply fiah-flcah. For lameness (mir. 43) salted quail ia given as an ointment; for paralysis (mir. 55) roasted figs mixed with wiue; and green leaves cured liver-complaint (mir. 61). A man who had been poisoned (mir. 68) w as saved by a concoction of lentils, which was used as a plaster and was also eaten. Baths were frequently prescribed (mir. 9, 47, 62). Holy water cured cataract and paralysis (mir. 2 and 39). A dumb Phoenician (mir. 64) was told in sleep by the martyra to drink water. \" They did not give the order in words, for he could not hear, but by nods and showing of the liquid.\" He awoke, drank the water, and was cured. The appearance of the martyra in the visions is often described. Cyrus had been a monk (In Laudeni Jll) and appeared habitually in monk's attire, while John, who had been a soldier, usually wore a military cloak- This statement la confirmed by several of the visions, which give further details in some individual cases. .\\t times both martyrs appear as monks, and the gentleness of their demeanour is remarked. They came as \"monks in ahining garments, and looked gently and mildly at Ihe patient\" (mir. 31), and sometimes they appeared aa priests (37 and 38). To Sophronioa himself (mir. 70) they came aa monks. Cyrus resem\u00ad bled the spiritual father and master of Sophronios who WHS in the leinple at the time, and John wos like ST, ciars AND ST, .iiniN- 155 one Peter of Alexandria, Prefect of the Pretoriana, and wore a miUtary cloak. They returned after a few daya, both wearing monka' stoles. Cyrua, as the older, waa leader, and John was his subordinate. Three instances are given in which the auppliant refuses to believe that what he has seen is a real viaion of the saints, but declares it to be an evil phantasy, and therefore does not carry out the instructions con\u00ad veyed to him. Tn each case the orders of the saints bordered on the ridiculous, and this comic element may account for the incredulity with which the suppliant received the vision. One man who was suffering from headache (mir. 18) was told to go to a certain door of the church and strike the fii^st person whom he met. The order was given three times before he obeyed. A soldier met him and returned the blow by a h stroke of his stick on the man's head, thus curing him. Theodoros (mir. 27) was told to swallow an asp, but he also refused to believe in the good faith of the vision. The third time the saints varied their command, and told him to eat whatever he found at the founta He did so, and in the cucumber, which he found the was hidden an asp. He swallowed half, without being aware of its presence, and it rid him of the poison. The experiences of an incredulous doctor are given in mir. 30. He became paralysed, and as a last resource betook himself to the saints. As he slept, they came by night and reproached him for his stupidity, com\u00ad manding him to take the pack-saddle of an ass and carry it on his shoulders. At mid-day he waa to go round the temple saying, \" I am stupid and mad,\" He thought it was a phantasy and not a genuine dream, but it was repeated a second time, and a bell was added 166 ST. CYRUS AND ST. JOHN to bis decorations. A third time he prayed for healing, and the same answer was given. He then was con\u00ad vinced of the genuineness of the apparition, and was cured on fulfilling the saints' commands. Twice the saints are said to appear not in a dream but in a waking viaion. In the one case, they gave the patient a piece of lemon (mir, 4); in the other, Zosimos, a paralytic (mir. 52), prayed for three days, and then was told to go and wash in the bath. His bearers left him on the mattress at the side of the bath. \" Then Cyrus appeared to the aick man in the form of a monk, not in a dream, as he appears to many, but in a waking vision, just aa he was and is repre\u00ad sented. He told the patient to rise and plunge into the warm water. Zosimos said it was impossible for him to move, but when the order was repeated, he shd like a snake into the bath. When he got into the water, he saw the saint at his side, but when he came out, the vision had vanished.\" Healing by a mysterious method is brought about for a cancer patient (mir. 19). Stephanis stood before the shrine, weeping and praying, and suddenly she waa healed of her disease, by the touch of \" visible hands,\" and not by unseen medicaments by which it was the custom of the s,niits to heal the sick. There were many witnesses of this cure, for it was daytime. Prom their report Sophronios learned the story. The saints appeared at other places besides their church. Sometimes they \\isit people at their homes, to bid them come to the church v9 and 29). They are supposed to be ubiquitous (mir. 60) and to know all things- They rescued from drowning a steward of their church by making the winds to cease (mir. ST. CVRL'S AND ST. JOHN 1.57 8). For the curing of disease, however, the church was the centre, and there the prescriptions and in\u00ad structions were issued in dreams. Many instances of the punishments which were meted out to wrong-doers are given by Sophronios. A rich woman of .Alexandria (mir. 29) had blasphemed against the saints, and while doing so one day, she bent down and could not rise up straight again. The saints appeared to her in sleep, and said they would euro her if she came to their church- She did so, and in spite of her former unbelief she was cured. The saints had their reward in the many valuable offerings she gave them, with a generosity the more remarkable as her benefactora were also believed to be the first cause of her trouble. Theodoros (mir. 31) waa struck blind for acting sacrilegiously in the church, but his sight was restored after three days. A heathen (mir. 32) pretended to be a Christian, but did not deceive the saints when he sought a cure for iraralysis. In a vision he was reproached with intent to defraud, and then he took the sacrament in insincerity, seeking still for healing. A demon seemed then to possess him, and he waa taken home to die. Another heathen, who waa blind, received his sight (mir. 38) after a profession of Christianity, but then fooliahly confided to a temple- servant that, when he returned home, he would go back to the faith of his fathera. The same night the martyra appeared, and told him to take a bath, after which he became blind again. He promised then to remain faithful, and his aight was restored. Two Egyptians (mir. 49) who were bringing offermg from two women to the church, appropriated to themselves the gifts, which were a sum of money and a. pig. On returning 158 ST. CYRCS AND ST. JOHN home, tho one became paralysed and the other a demoniac. They w (.iit back in penitence to the church, and while the one was cured on paying up the money, the other was not freed from the evil spirit, but was kept as a servant in the church. vn. St. Julian, St. Martin, St. Maxiininus, St. Fides ST. JCLL\\N.\u2014At .\\rvernus was a church built to guard the tomb of St. Julian. Miracles of heal\u00ad ing were wrought there by the martyr, bringing widespread fame to the church. Near by, on the spot where JulUn had been wounded, flowed a sacred foun\u00ad tain, the watere of which possessed healing properties. Blind men, fever patients, and demoniacs were restored to health by drinking of it. In the church itself cures were performed on paralytics, lame and blind men, and all kinds of sufferers, Gregory of Tours' gives an account of some of these miracles which took place in his own time. The narra\u00ad tive is a contemporary one, and not without personal touches. He himself was cured of a headache (\u00a725) by the water of the fountain ; and his brother (\u00a724) when suffering from a fever, held vigils at the tomb, and then asked that dust from the tomb be hung round his neck. When this was done the fever left him. The story is similar to a case of incubation in which a prescription for cure is given, proving to be the necessary remedy. The difference is between volun\u00ad tary incubation and vigils, and is not so great as it appears, for the patient's mind has been prepared in the same way to be receptive of visions. A great number of the cures related by Gregory belong to the vigil class; others, again, were performed in sleep. >De VirmOmS. Jviiani. 160 BT. JULKN Another relative of Gregory was benefited by the saitit (\u00a723), His uncle, who afterwards became bishop, got a thorn in his foot and could not extract it. He prostrated himself at the saint's tomb, and then after his vigils returned to bed and slept. On awaking he rose up without pain and found the splinter in the bed. He considered this aa a miracle wrought by St. Julian, and it was his custom to display the scar in order to demonstrate the saint's power, Gregory gives one story of a sleeping vision with full details (\u00a79). It is a case of involuntary incuba\u00ad tion. The following is hia account:\u2014\" Fedamia, a paralysed woman, who could not move any limb with\u00ad out pain, was brought by her relatives to the holy church that she might receive alms from donors. She passed the Sunday night in the portico which adjoins the holy chureh, while the devout faithful celebrated holy vigils, and she slept a little while lying on her couch. Then she was seized and chidden by a man in a vision. He asked why she was aiisent when the others were holding nocturnal services to the glory of God. Her answer was that she was weak in all her limbs, and could not walk into the church. It seemed as if she were carried by the man who had sjioken to her, and taken to the tomb, while she spoke in her sleep, A quantity of chains seemed to foil on to the ground from her limbs. The sound awoke her, and she felt that she had regained'full power of her limbs. Than she rase from her couch, and to the astonish\u00ad ment of all entered tho church crying nut thanks. Some say she was accustomed to tell the appearance of the man who had spoken to her. She said he was tall in stature, brightly clothed, of great elegance, and of ST, MARTIN 161 a cheerful countenance. He had yellow hair, was quick in gait, free in voice, bland of address, and his skin shone witb a whiteness surpassing the lily's, so that of the many thousands of men she had seen, none was like to him. It seemed probable to many that the blessed martyr had appeared to her. The woman was cured after eighteen years of illness.\" ST. ]MARTI>\".\u2014In the town of Tours, the church of St- ilartin was a centre of health-miracles. Gregory' gives some account of the works of the saint, mentioning one or two instances of personal experience. The majority of his stories are not cases of voluntary incubation, but all types of miracles are given without particular distinc\u00ad tions being made- The case of Veranus (Bk. ii. \u00a74) is one of incubation. He had suffered from severe gout for a year, when he was taken by his master to the shrine and deposited at the feet of the saint. He lay there for five days, and on the sixth day fell asleep- In sleep he had a vision, and awoke completely cured. St- Martin is found to act in conjunction with St-. Julian.^ A blind woman came to the church of St. Martin and lay prostrate for three days. Then in a dream she received a message from the saint, who said to her, \" If you desire to receive your sight, go to the Church of St. JuUan.\" The activity of St. Martin was not confined to his church at Toura- He was worshipped at a small chapel called the Cellula Condatensis, and there also he healed the sick- Vinastis, a blind man (ii. \u00a723), had been in the habit of giving alms to the poor at thia chapel 'i>3 VtrtulSfOii B. Mariini. = -De Virtviiims S. Jidiant. \u00a747, p. 583. 162 ST. MARTIN and of praying before the aacred couch. While pray\u00ad ing he fell asleep. A man appeared to him in a vision, and told him to go to the church of St. Martin and there he would find full healing. He did so, and re\u00ad covered his sight. Another man fiii. \u00a723), who had been deprived by fever of speech and hearing, lived for six yeara on alms at this Cellula. One Sunday night while sleeping he saw the whole floor flooded with light, and had a vision of a man in priest's garments, who touched him, laid the cross on his forehead, and said, \"The Lord make thee whole. Rise, hasten to the church and give thanks to thy God.\" Afra (ii. \u00a731) received her cure partiy at home and partly at the church. She had lost the use of her limbs through fever. An old man appeared to her by night, and touched all her limbs gently. In the morning she found her feet and one hand cured. Another day, she was instructed, during sleep, to go to the holy church of St. Martin. At midnight, when she was keeping vigil, the other hand was healed. No detailed description is given of the appearance of St. Martin in the visions. Sometimes he is an old man, again he is dressed in black garments, and has white hair (\u00a740); in ^56 he weara purple and carries the cross; again he is dressed as a priest and carries the croas (iii. \u00a723); on another occasion he appears smiling, with a happy countenance, carrying his usual armour. One case is given (ii. \u00a756) which resembles the Epidaurian inscription where the woman is cured on her way home from the temple. The Christian woman had paralysis of the fiiifjera, and visited the church, but was not successful in finding healing. On her way ST. MASIUINUS 163 home, she slept a night near the river le Cher, and as she slept, a man clothed in purple and bearing the crosa appeared to her, and said, \" Now thou wilt be healed in the name of the Saviour Jesus Christ-\" Then he took her hand and put his fingere between here. She awoke to find herself cured. ST. MASIMINCS.\u2014Near the town of Treves stood a monastery, built by Constantine the Great, who dedicated it to St. John the Evangelist. Its widespread fame was derived from the miracles which God showed unto men through his ser\u00ad vant St. Maximinus.' In the fourth century, Maximinus had been bishop of Treves, succeeding Agricius about 332 A.D. The date of his death is given as 349, and he was buried in the church of this monas\u00ad tery. Gregory of Tours^ writes of him thus :\u2014\" Near the towm of Treves, in the outskirts, rests St, Maxi\u00ad minus, the mighty advocate of that people with the Lord, and at his tomb glorious miracles are often wit\u00ad nessed.\" He then proceeds to relate the punishment of a man who committed perjury over the tomb of the saint in the beginning of the seventh century. Two records of these miracles are extant. The first belongs to the eighth century, and is by an anonymous writer. The second is written by Sigehardus, a monk of the ninth century. They show that incubation was a practice in the church at Treves, and in the worship of St- Maximinus. Charles Martel (\u00a712 p. 24) was seized with fever, and lay at death's door, when a vision appeared to him. The apparition declared himself to be St. Maximinus, 'Acta Sand. Miii., ,, p. 19. \" De Gloria Con/eaaorum. Ch 93. 164 BT, JiAzmmos and bade the sufferer go to his tomb at Trfeves for healing. Charles hod himself conveyed to the tomb, and there fell asleep, A second time the apparition came to him, saying, \"I have supplicated the Lord for you that you may be saved.\" The king awoke from sleep and found himself in excellent health. He showed his gratitude to the saint by bestowing gifts on the church. The saint appeared in viaion at other places besides his church. A man, who was staying at the house of Wenilo, a servant of the church (\u00a721 p. 30), suffered agony with erysipelas in the foot- For two days and nighto he did not cease calling upon St. Maximinus for succour. The pain grew less on the third night, and he fell asleep. Then St. Maximinus appeared and asked him why he had so lamented. On hearing of his sufferings, the saint told him to send for some oil from the lamp which hung before the altar, and with it anoint his foot. The man awoke, called Wenilo, and sent him to fetch the oil. After anointing him\u00ad self with it, he was cured of the disease. This is an ordinary case of a sleeping-vision during which a pre\u00ad scription of the usual symbolic nature is given. St. Maximinus, as patron-saint, was ready to save those who called upon him. Once during a terrific storm (\u00a714 p, 24) a ship was in danger of being wrecked, when one Ibbo prayed to St, Maximinus to help them. Thereupon he had a \\-ision of a man bright as the sun, who went over the sea before the ship and said, \" Be not afraid.\" The storm ceased, and all were saved. Prayers and vigils at the tomb brought healing also. A priest (\u00a722 p, 30) whose eyes were affected, found himself cured in the morning ST. MAXIMINUS 166 after a night passed in prayer at the tomb, A blind man (\u00a78) came from Beneventum to Treves because of advice given him by St. Peter in a vision. He recovered his aight after prayer at the tomb. A woman with a withered foot (\u00a710) was healed during the night after peraistent prayer. Therafter mention is made of the frequency with which such miracles were performed on blind men, lepere, paralytics, and other diseased people. Especially was St Maximmua noted for the cure of demoniacs. On his feast-days great numbere of men and women were freed from evil spirits. Some were cured at once on entering the chureh, and the most difficult cases did not baffle the saint. King Pepin sent one of his clerks all over the countiy to get release from an evil spirit, but he sought in vain until he came to St. Maximinus, who cured him at once. Mention is made in several passages of the ' Brothers ' or monks who worked at the church amongst the sick and demoniacB, They prayed for the patienta (\u00a7\u00a711, 15), their prayers were heard and healing given. We read of \"those who are occupied with the sick\u00ad beds in the open air \" '^ p- 26), whose duties tocluded the care of demoniacs, kept in bonds under strict sur\u00ad veillance. The church seems to have been used as a sort of asylum for the insane, who were kept there until some mii^cle released them from the evil spirit. The Brothera acted as exorcists and tried to drive out these spirits. Two women who were possessed (\u00a76 p. 26) came to the church, but the Brothera could effect nothing. They were then taken to the holy crypt, where they at once fell asleep, and when they awoke the spirits had left them. Another demoniac (\u00a77) 166 ST. MAXIMINUS managed to escape his guards aud break loose. He descended to the crypt where he waa met by one of the church officials. The latter seized a rod which lay in the ctypt and struck the madman with it. He fell asleep as if tamed by the blow, and woke up cured. Several instances of signal punishment of vfrong- doing and impiety are given. A Duke Gisilbertus (\u00a713. p. 28) oppressed the Brothera, who appealed against him to their patron-saint. He appeared in a vision to the Duke and upbraided him, beating him on the side and shouldera. Then he disappeared. When the Duke awoke, the marks of the blows were visible. The beating had the desired effect. The Duke went to Treves, restored stolen property, and gave many gifts. Eusticus (\u00a715 p. 24) was punished for audacious scep\u00ad ticism. When he entered the church he saw the lamps moving of themselves, and said, \" Verily ye are cheats, who say that St. Maximinus works these, while ye do it by your own devices.\" Straightway he was pos\u00ad sessed of an evil spirit and brought near to death. Then he was taken to the tomb, and through the prayers and supplications of the servants of God, he received full healing. ST. FIDES.\u2014The worahip of St. Fides,* a virgin martyr, was carried on in her church at Conques in Bouergue, where her tomb was famous for miracles. When twelve yeare old, 303 A.D., she had suffered martyrdom at the town of Afjin. whence her body was stolen and con\u00ad veyed to the monastery at Conques. According to a narrative poem, thia transference was a recent event in ' Liber Miraoulonim Sand* Fidi\u00bb. Ed. A. Booillet. ST. FIDES 167 883 A.D. Pilgrimages to Conques then took place from all quartere. The account of the saint's miracles is written by one of these pilgrims, Bernard of Angera, who wrote about 1012 A.D. He professed to have col\u00ad lected the most remarkable of the miracles, and with\u00ad out being able to go into chronological detaila, he vouched for the truth and accuracy of his stories. Some of them he received verbally from the beneficiaries. This was the case in the firat miracle he relates, and also in the ninth. The latter was wrought on a blind girl, while Bernard was sojourning at the chureh. She had been holding a vigil at the tomb, when suddenly she was able to see. A further personal touch is the cure of the writer's brother (iii. 13). He was released from great pain after the invocation of Bernard to St. Fides on his behalf. Besides these instances, other chronological facta are given to the effect that certain events took place three years before, or some other short space of, time. The miracles are thus con\u00ad temporary history of the tenth century and the beginning of the eleventh. The chureh was renowned for the healing of the sick. Pilgrims came especially for the feast-day of the saint, and passed the night in vigil and prayer before the golden image of St. Fides, while the monks chanted a solemn devotional service. Then on the following day the image was carried round in procession, and during its passage many wondera were wrought. Some of these are narrated by Bernard (ii, 4 20), The dnmb were made to speak, the blind to see, and the paralytics to walk, as the image passed along through the country. All the year round, cures took place in the church. The treatment of the sick was a daily pro-ST. FIDES ceeding. One night just before Bernard's arrival, eleven sick people were restored during different visions. But Bernard does not seek to give promin\u00ad ence to this curative phase of the saint's work (i. 9). He devotes himself rather to relating the punishments which befell those who sought to defraud St- Fides in any way, or he narrates the more unusual works, such as the resuscitation of men and animals, or the release of prisoners from captivity. It is, however, with the medical aspect that we have to deal, and while there is a paucity of detail in Ber\u00ad nard's Book, yet we have a number of instances where the saint was said to visit the patient in sleep, and either give a prescription for the case, or herself perform the work of healing. So the church at Conques may be considered to be another centre of Christian incubation, and that practice to belong to the worship of this saint- Aa we have hitherto found in Christian incubation, prayers and vigils have the prominent part, and sleep or a quiescent state usually comes unsought. Volun\u00ad tary incubation is also found. The story of a Norman (iii. 6) is an example of this. He had lost his sight while sleeping in the open air, and he determined to visit varioua oraclea of the saints. Pome was reached, and at the shrine of some saint whose identity is not given, prayer was offered up. In sleep he received the answer that he must go to St. Fides for cure- Not knowing where the church of the saint waa situated, he neglected the warning. For two yeara he remained at home blind, and then bethought himself of St. Fides. At Conques he prayed firat, and thereafter sought sleep- In the vision which came to him, two lovely birds ST. FIDES 169 seemed t-o fly towards him and fix two candles in bis eyes. On awakening, he went to the altar and prayed again, -\\s he rose, a sudden pain shot through Jiis head, and blood gushed from his eyes. Then his sight was restored, and in gratitude he offered up a du(^t to the saint. The following is another case of cure in the church- A soldier (iv- 10) was wounded in the arm and lost the use of it. He went to Conques, and held vigils before the tomb; then he fell asleep. In sleep he heard a voice telling him to rise up and make the sign of the cross. After a third telling, he arose astonished, and raised his hand. Then he awoke, and recognised that he was cured. The first miracle that Bernard relates contains a somewhat similar cure, which was told him by the beneficiary himself. Witbert had his eyes put out by a cruel master, as he was returning from the feast of St- Fides at Conques. A dove or a magpie picked up the eyes all streaming with blood, and carried them back to Conques. Witbert remained bUnd for a year, but the day before the vigil of the saint's feast, as he slept, be had a vision of a fair young girl who told him she waa St. Fides, and bade him go to Conques, and buy two candles, one of which was to be placed on the altar of the Saviour, and the other on her own. That done, he would regain his sight- He obeyed, and then lay down before the golden image of the martyr. About midnight he thought he saw bright gems like laurel berries being fixed in his eyes. Then he slept, and when he awoke his sight was restored, and his eyes were in their sockets. Whenever, as in the above story, the appearance of the heavenly visitor is described, it is that of a young 170 BT. PIUBS girl about ten yeara old, clad in golden armour and of great beauty. So she appeared to Gerbert, a soldier, (i. 2) whose eyes had been torn out. He remained eight daya and nights in the country without food, wishing to starve to death. On the laat night a maiden of great beauty appeared to him, and seemed to put in hia eyes with her fingera. When he awoke, he was atill blind, but he resolved to go to Conques. He stayed at the hospice there, and aftor praying at the church for several days, he recovered his sight. Blindness is the infirmity which is cured most frequently according to Bernard's account. A blind girl (i. 9), along with her mother, passed the night in the chureh holding vigils, and together ^vith them were many othera similarly engaged- In the firat wateb the girl recovered her sight, to the astonishment of all. The visitations of St- Fides were not confined to the church. .Many cures are related which were performed elsewhere, and the beneficiary afterwards made a pilgrimage to the church to show gratitude by prayera and gifts. A soldier (ii. 7) received a gash with a sword on the face, so that the bones were visible and the face was divided up. He resolved to go to St. Fides, and while he slept by night after his resolve, tho saint appeared to him in her beauty, and laid a healing finger on hia face, and put her palm under his chin, so that the face closed and healed up. He awoke, and found his face perfectly healed. Gerald, another soldier, (iv. 17) was wounded in the side, and through neglect the wound putrefied. While sleeping by night ho thought he loy before the altar of St. Fides on the Hoor, and St. Fides come to him carrying a ST. FIDES 171 rod in her hand. She touched the sore with the rod, and the blood gushed forth, covering the floor. She told him to give thanks to the Saviour and praises before her ow-n tomb. When he awoke, he recalled the words of the \"holy physician\" (sancta medico), and found that the wound had been opened and the poison expelled, so that his cure was effected. St. Fides figures as a patron saint. She came to ielp her devotees in distant parts, when they were in distress, and she sent swift punishment on all who sought to injure them or herself. Her pro\u00ad tecting influence was dominant, and she was a respecter of persons. A certain soldier who worahipped her (iii. 23) brought three dumb men at different times to the church, and tbey received the gift of speech by his intercession. She gave special care to the soul as well as to the body. Gerbert (i. 2) was forced to remain in the church and serve her, leading a virtuous life. instead of returning to his former occupations. Especially do we remark that this saint prized gifts. She demanded rings and other precious gifts (i. 18) from her suppliants, and would not be cheated of her dues. PART in. The Practice of Incubation durir^ Modem Times I. Introduction In Greece at the present day it is not uncommon for the devout auppliant to have recourse to incubation as a means of approaching the powera of Heaven, The antiquity of the practice, which is a relic of the country's much-prized past, gives it a firm standing, and the success often attached to it ensures its wide popularity among a credulous and impressionable people. In Italy, tero, the custom, introduced in pagan times from Greece, stiE prevails, as we shall see, to a considerable extent in the south, where Greek influence was strongest- Modern incubation is a clear survival of the ancient usage. The essential identity of the two practices has already been shown in the section dealing with the medieval sainta, and incuba\u00ad tion at the present day is a direct continuation of the custom of the Middle Ages. Sixteenth century travellers attest the existence of the practice after the records of the sainta have stopped, and the modern tourist may acquire first-hand knowledge of this cere\u00ad mony by witnessing in person the act of incubation at some festival of the Church. 174 INTRODUCTION As in the early centuries of Christianity, the local saints figure most prominently, and acting as the agents of God they sometimes obscure the Deity. The Ponagia, or Virgin, holds the firat place of power and influence, playing the [^rt of the pagan goddesses. She has moat often the attributes and character of Isis, but Aphrodite and Demeter also appear in her. Then there are numerous patron saints, possessed of special powers, to whom the peasants betake themselves when in trouble. Those churches which are fortunate enough to possess the relics of a saint have a clear claim upon thot saint's beneficence. Other local saints show their origin in their names, which are slightly varied forms of the names of certain pagan gods or goddesses, or are derived from the functions which they are supposed to perform. For example, St. Artemidos is worshipped in Keos, and St- Dionysios in NaxoB. Thia suggests at once Artemis and Dionysos, and the connection seems established when we find that the pagan attributes have been transferred to the saints. Dionysos was bom in Naxos, according to tradition, and the island was one of the chief centres of his worahip. Now the modern Naxiotes' relate a Christian myth, explaining how the first wine was made by St. Dionysios. .Vrtemis* was worshipped as the Child Rearer, and St. Artemidos is the protector of ailing children in the islands. They are often brought to some church of his, and left there under his care. St. Therapon, the Healer in Mytileue, shows his function in his cures deafness\u2014'AKOVIJIOI, KW^OKTIS, deafness. Saints such as these have been created and are now supported by the Greek Church for tho same reason that many pagan customs were retained under different forms in the new religion. The people required sub\u00ad stitutes for tho old gods, and most important for them were the iora,l deities. Their place was taken by the Saints and the Madonna, whose powers are as varied as were those of their predecessors. Some have a particular department of good work in which they are supreme. St- Nicholas, for instance, presides over the sea, and to bim as their patron sailors make their vows and offerings before and after a voyage. Many of the saints show their beneficence in all kinds of distress, if they are petitioned in the fit and proper way- The chief practical help which a patron saint can give is in healing the aick, and it is with then- therapeutic work that we have now to deal. When a devout Greek is so ill that doctors are of no avail, or when he disdains human medical skill, he begs the aid of the Madonna or of one of the saints, and his means of doing this is the act of incubation. The modern practice is essentially the same as that which we have deacribed at the shrines of the samts in the early centuries of Christianity. Briefly, the patient passes a night in the church, and during sleep he has a vision of some heavenly peraonage. In the morning he awakes cured. He believes himself that his disease comes from some supernatural agent, and must be overcome by supernatural means. The nature of these cures is much debated. There PoIitee\u2014AcATKii', 188.% p. 1. 176 INTBODUCTION can be no doubt that people, through all the centuries, have been cured, and still are being cured of disease in ways which ore independent of ordinary medical treatment. While making allowance for much trickery and exaggeration which naturally are introduced into a practice so adapted for deception, we cannot set aside all health-miracles with the explanation that they were manipulated by the priests. It is more in accordance with the facts to relegate the cures to the same category as hypnotic or magnetic curea, the miracles of Notre Dame de Lourdes, or de lo Saiette, and the faith-cures of modem Christian Science. The nature of the diseasi:, has remained in the same general type throughout the three periods. Blindness, paralysis, and insanity are the chief afflictions which are successfully treated in these so-called miraculous way^. The cur^ are of a psychological, rather than physiological, character, ,and whatever is elTected must be through the influence of mind on matter. The modern cures by hypnotism arc proof of the possibilities of the power of mind- influence, or the power of suggestion. Suggestion, whether emanating from the hypnotiser or from some niiitcrial cause or object, resolves itself into self-sugges\u00ad tion, and the final action is that of the patient's own mind on his body. The preliminary rites and cere\u00ad monies of the pagans, and the devotions which precede the Christian cures, serve as a means of magnetising tho patient's mind so that it acts on his body. The ancient miracles of Epidauros must be set apart aa unique in a class by themselves, but in the other cures the presence of a supernatural agent is not sufficiently definite to warrant belief- Hypnotism or magnetism can claim similar cures, without ascribing to them any I.NTRODDCTION 177 miraculous elements. The difference is only in the method of obtaining the cure, and one of the methods is incubation. Incubation at the present day is practised in two ways- The supphant may go to the church inde\u00ad pendently, on any day of the year, and pass one night or several nights in the church, performing whatever rites and ceremonies he individually may think proper and pleasing to the particular aaint whose help he invokes- Or he may take iiart in some annual panegyris or festival on the saint's day, and along with the other pilgrims pass the night in the church. Each chnrch has one or two days, the feast of its patron saint, set aside for its panegyris, and if it is an incubation centre, then that practice is performed as part of the celebrations. The belief prevails that the Virgin and the Saints are more accessible on their feast days. They are thought to descend to earth then, and confer favours on their suppliants. Naturally it is at their churches that they alight in their descent from heaven. The festivals are thus the popular occasions for all supplications to be offered, and, where the saint is famed for healing powers, crowds of sick people throng bis church seeking to reach him through incubation. Cases of independent incubation are of frequent occurrence in Greece and Asia Minor, Attached to them ia a simplicity which distinguishes them from the ceremonies at festivals. An instance of the simple, ancient incubation was witnessed by Le Bas' in the church of the Maritza Monastery in the north of the Peloponnese. Entering the church, he found there a ' S^vue Archiokgiqiie\u2014lSii\u2014l. p, 283. 178 INTRODUCTION woman with her baby in her arms. Her bed was laid before the altar, and she had come to pass the night, hoping that the Virgin would appear to her in a dream, and tell her of a cure for the sickness of the child. Parallel cases will be found in the particulara of the various churches which I give later from first-hand knowledge, In primitive country churches, such as the barn-like buildings which I visited in Boeotia, Arcadia, and Argolis, the practice is this simple temple- sleep. Thither the pcasanto resort when in distress, either bodily or mental. Especially lunatics are taken to the churches for cure. The frequency of this treat\u00ad ment for insanity in the Middle Ages has already been discussed. The same idea as to actual possession by a demon still prevails, and the priest exorcises the patient with the Cross, the Scripture, or some other symbol of the divine power, seeking thus to overcome the evil spirit which has entered into the patient's mind. Often the lunatic is left in the church for a long period. Sometimes, as in the Middle .^ges, he is kept chained to a pillar, while his relatives pray for him, and the priest reads the Scripture in order to expe! the demon. \"^ One feature of the practice of incubation is the use of sacred emblems. I have already shown how it developed in the early Christian Church. Any rehcs of a saint, or holy dust, watej, or oil, played a large part in the cures, and amulets sanctified in some way by the aaint were much used. The same belief in mediuma of the divine power is current to-day. Numerous instances of it can be seen in the everyday life of Greeks or Italians, and of all superetitiously religious peoples, but at festivals where incubation is IXTRODBCTION 179 practised it ia especially evident. Sacred pictures, the most precious of which are attributed to the hand of St. Luke, take the first place as efficacious healing influences. -\\s a rule they have been discovered in a miraculous way. The Madonna or a saint has ap\u00ad peared to some individual in a vision and has instructed him to dig for the picture, which, when brought to light, has been fotmd to possess miraculous powers of healing. Such, for example, are the pictures which I afterwards describe at Tenos, Mytilene, and Megas- pelaion. Bodies, bones, and any relics of saints are other most powerful mediums. In Corfu, incubation before the shrine containing the body of St. Spiridion is believed to give effective healing. The skull of St, Seraphim at Dobo in Boeotia has \" wondrous power in driving away all kinds of evil.'\" Xear Canea, in Crete, is the monastery of St. Eleutherios,* where a piece of the true Cross, enclosed in an iron crucifix, is cherished. Any demoniac who kisses it is said to be completely cured. It is a common custom to use earth or oil from the sacred building, and commonest of all is the use of holy water. The sanctuaries of Asklepios had sacred wells, which played, as we have seen, a prominent part in the cures. Healing centres at the present day also have auch springs and wells, which are sometimes identical ^vith those of the pagan temple, and sometimes have been discovered in a miracnlons viaion which invests them with therapeutic powers. Throughout Greece holy wells are found attached to almost every church or monastery where incubation is practised. They are especially numerous ' Leake\u2014Narthf.m Greece, ii. 51. ' Vs,eh\\es\u2014Trai-:h in CreU, i. 8. 180 INTRODUCTION in Cyprus and Crete. Ten miles east from Hierapetra in Crete are the fountain and cave where St, Paul preached and baptised. The water still cures sore eyes.* At festivals these springs are much frequented, and their use is combined with the other methods of healing. The festivals are in this respect, and also in their other chief characteristica, reproductions of the ancient gatherings which the pagan Greeks held periodically in honour of their various gods. The days set apart are times of holiday and rejoicing for all con\u00ad cerned. Dancing and feasting goes on in the villages, after due worehip has been paid to the saint. The ceremonies and services are attended punctiliously and reverently, and devotion is particularly deep on the part of thoae who have some favour to ask. They prepare themselves in that way for incubation. At night the special suppliants sleep in the church and await divine revelations while the others are merry\u00ad making in the village. Each little church has Its feaat- day, when the neighbouring peasants visit it. The large churches hold great festivals, to which come pil\u00ad grims from all parts. The panegyris of Tenos, which I describe later, is the greatest festival of the Greek Church. Pilgrims flock to it from Egypt and Turkey. In the same way, the games at Epidauros in honour of Asklepios were attended by pilgrims from all coun\u00ad tries. The namea on the votive tableta show how the god distributed his favoure far and wide. At Epidauros, too, the suppliants spent the day in pious preparation and the night in incubation. Then when they awoke in the morning, some were found to be cured. When the festival was over, the votive offer- \" Pwhley\u2014JVoi'ri* in C>;le. ii. 260. ISXRODnCTION 181 ings were given, according to the discretion of the donore. To-day nothing is demanded, but it is a work of piety to give to the Church as much as one's means allow. The amazing quantity of votive offerings to be seen in the churches attests the faith and gratitude of the people. Another point of resemblance exists between the temples of Asklepios and the modem healing churches. The Asklepieia developed in many instances into health resorts, where sick people stayed for lengthy periods, worshipping and practising incubation, in hope of cure. Some of the Greek churches encourage similar courses. In particular I mention afterwards the latrissa in Laconia and the church at Balukli, near Constanti\u00ad nople. Eotmd about Pamassos also the practice is prevalent. Sick people come to the high-lying village of Arachova, and visit the church every day to pray, and sometimes pass a night in incubation. Curea take place occasionally after a stay of this description. The Jerusalem monastery near Daulia on Parnassos receives sick people in this way. They reside in the monastery, and give their aervicea to the monks, until they can go away restored to health. I now give particulars of various incubation centres in Greece and Italy, with details of the practice as it is carried on in modem times. n. Italy, Sardinia, Austria The south of Italy is a land of superatition. In the churches, which arc regarded as the dwellings of those miracle-workers, the Madonna and Saints, traditions and practices of pure paganism are upheld. This Magna Graecia, where Isis, the giver of health to the sick, was once popularly worshipped, is now pervaded by the cult of the Madonna as Healer. The two divinities, the Egyptian mother-goddess and the Chris\u00ad tian Madonna, bear the closest resemblance to each other in attributes and powers. Like the Panagia in Greece, the Madonna of the Eoman Church succeeded to the position of Isis, and this inheritance accounts, to some extent at least, for the prominence given to the healing power of the Madonna in the south- Countless churehea have special shrines of the Madonna as Healer. Proof of the faith which her powera inspire is seen in the array of votive offerings which adorn the walls, altars, and pillars. To take an example\u2014^in the church of Santa Chiara in Naples, there is a humble altar on the left as you enter, dedicated to Santa Maria della Grazia. Insignificant and devoid of beauty as it is, to some it has been the chief attraction in this magnificent church, for here they can have access to the Gracious Madonna, Prayera for health and other special favours arc heard at this shrine and are ful\u00ad filled. The grateful beneficiaries then give some votive offering in token of their thankfulness. .Vt this altar these take the form either of on unage of the Madonna, or of a representation of the act or process of deliver-ance. There are several models of the Virgin hanging round the altar, and about fifty small pictures, crude representations of the healing of the sick. The general type is a brilliantly-coloured daub, portraying a sick person in bed, one or two relatives, as mourners, in tearful attitudes at the bedside, and above a heavenly visitant, ready to perform the act of healing- Most often the pictures are of sick children with their parents. Other votive offerings commonly seen in the churohes of Italy represent the part of the body that has been healed. In the church of La Gancia at Palermo, the altar of the Madonna is hung round about with numer\u00ad ous offerings. Among the most prominent are legs, feet, arms, modelled m pink wax flecked with several red spots, to indicate wounds.' Many long dark plaits of hair hang among the limbs, and the wall is adorned with pictures of invalids iu bed, of railway collisions, shipwrecks, assassinations, and burning accidents, in all of which the Madonna has appeared as Saviour. It is unnecessary to dwell upon the survival of the pagan custom of ex-voto gifts as seen in these offerings. Identical offerings have been found in many pagan temples. Eepresentations of parts of the body and plaits of hair were among the most common gifts to the deity. In the neighbourhood of Naples the cult of the Isis- Madonna is especially popular- AH the year round, devotees may go to the churches, practise incubation there, and offer prayers in hope of receiving f avoura, but success ia believed to be most certain at festival times. Each church has at least one day in the year when pilgrimages come to it, and processions and festal per-184 ITALY formances after the ancient style are held. One of the most interesting and most elaborate of these festivals is held at the church of the Madonna of the Baths near Scafati.' During Ascension week it is visited by great numbera of pilgrims, amongst whom are many aick people. These invalids, cripples, paralytics, etc., come with the purpose of sleeping in the church, aa near as possible to the Madonna's picture. As in the temples of Isis, they hope to get revelations in dreams and thus obtain healing. Other methods of cure are tried. One hour distant from the church are the famous baths. On Ascension Day the priests begin bathing and baptismal ceremonies, for which so many make the pilgrimage. The watera are believed to possess healing powers, and miraculous cures are said to occur frequently. Another Madonna church, the goal of popular pil\u00ad grimage in the neighbourhood of Naples, is the Santa Maria of the Bow, near the village of St. Anastasia. The feast days occur three times a year, at Easter and Pentecost, and on 8th September. The cult origin\u00ad ated four hundred years ago, and the Madonna became famous for her miracles of healing, punishment of wrongdoing, and preservation in time of danger, such as plague and earthquake. The present chureh is a large domed building. The interior is covered with the usual style of votive offerings, memorials of people who have been at the point of death, and have been cured by the Madonna's intervention, Eecorda of the chief miracles of healing are kept in the church. Saumartino' in his official pamphlet gives the names ITALI 185 of over a hundred cases of cure. Lame and blind chil\u00ad dren and adulte have been cured by presence in the church before the sacred image. The miraculous pic\u00ad ture of the Madonna and Child is kept in the inner\u00ad most sanctuary, and is spoken of in rapturous rhetoric by the pnest. On some of the walls crutches and bandages are seen fixed up as offerings, telling of actual cure. To the right of the great altar are piles of little coffins, offered by grateful parents whose children have been restored to health by Santa Maria. In 1629, it is recorded that a child who had died \\\\ as resurrected in the chureh. His coffin is still pointed out, high up among the others. Demoniacs, also, are said to be cured. To them is applied the sacred oil from one of the chnrch lamps. Usually in the Isis-Madonna cures some medium is employed, and simple incubation does not suffice, although it precedes the cure. Hence the prominence of sacred pictures in the churches, or of some other sanctified symbol. Besides the churches which are the scene of popular festivals, there are scattered throughout the south of Italy many smaller churches, where incubation is often practised in a quiet and unceremonious way by a chance pilgrim at any season of the year. Anyone who is in a state demanding miraculous help may have recourse to one of these churches, and may choose the way he deems best for obtaining it- Incubation is one of the favourite means in vogue among the half-Greek inhabitents of Calabria and the south. By passing a night before the shrine, they hope to win the favour of the Madonna or the Saint, who will be more ready to come to their help there than in their own homes. The Cathedral in the littie town of Amalfi is one 186 ITALY example of a church of this description. It is dedicated to St. Andrew, and a statue of the saint, said to be the work of Michael Angelo, though the execution belies it, stands in the crypt. This crypt is the ancient chapel under the cathedral, and in it the actual incu\u00ad bation takes place. The statue of St. Andrew stands in the centre, and at his feet is a little locked shrine, in which a miraculous stone is kept. On certain feast daya, three or four times a year, the shrine is unlocl^d, and a high dignitary of the church examines the stone to see if its miraculous powers are in working order. Occasionally the stone responds to the priest's test and exudes a drop of oil. Similar miraculous oil has been found at Heracleo-' In the metropolitan chureh there stands the tomb of St, Glyceria, Oil drops from the marble of the tomb in a miraculous way, and is used for healing purposes. At Amalfi the oil, when found, is of the greatest sanctity, and is used to benefit the sick who come to the crypt. There they often pass the night, and in sleep have a vision of the saint- In the morning they are cured by a touch of the miraculous oil, \\\"oiive pic\u00ad tures are hung up here as in the other churches. One recorda an attested case of incubation during 1902- It is the picture of a boy, over whom a buteher's cart is passing. The horse is galloping madly, and the boy is directly under the wheels. On ^th June, 1902, Umberto Casaese, a native of Nola, aged 13, fell out of the cart in Amalfi, and the wheel went over him, injuring hia face and body to a terrible extent. He was carried into the crypt, in this mangled condition, and having slept there one night, iu the moruii^ he Dallas null Cavel\u2014VoyagBi and TramU in Iht Lttvnt, p, 275-IT.U.Y 187 was quite cured after a touch of the miraculous oil. He left the church with full powera of limb and body. .411 superatitions regarding sacred oil, water, amulets, etc., are encouraged by the Church in the south of Italy, and the natoral disposition of the people, ever ready to believe in the miraculous, receives support from the priesthood. It is a source of profit for them to have credulous and superstitious worahippers, and great trade ia done in precious relics and charms. But apart from such adjuncts, the ancient practice of in\u00ad cubation stands out clear in Italy. It is otherwise in Sicily. The influence of miraculous picture, curative hot-springs, and wonder working amulets has caused incnbation to disappear. Trede^ professes to have found the practice at Mareala. The church of St. John has been built over the tomb of the Cumaoan sibyl, and the place might well serve as the seat of an oracle. But in recent yeara the church h^ fallen into disrepair and has now been entirely shut up. Houel' describes the church, and says that on St. John's Eve people went to consult the oracle. In the middle of the church two staitcases descend to the grotto, where there is a well. The suppliants drink the water, and after a cry. Echo answera, and they take thia as the oracular response. The leading idea of incubation is that the saints descend to earth to help and heal, particularly on their feast days. This belief is also traceable in many of the curious practices which are kept np in outlying districts- St. John the Baptist is thought to be especi\u00ad ally ready to help in this way. On the eve of his festival it is believed that he sends abroad mysterious beneficent virtues into the waters and flowers, and those who duly perform the rites and ceremonies may benefit therefrom. In certain villages of Calabria Citeriore' they say that on St. John's Eve the sick go down to the sea-shore, where there is a small chapel. In it they pass the night, and at dawn strip and rush to the sea, returning to perform certain sacred rites. They believe that on that day the water is endowed with special medicinal power by the infiuence of St. John. Similar practices are common in Sardinia. In the village of Bdttida,^ on the same evening, those who wish to ask a favour from St. John go on their knees for thirty metres to his chapel. Arrived at the door, they say in a loud voice : \"St. John, I have come for the favour you know of.\" Then they rise up, go down to the stream, always in devout silence, and there plunge in. After this mystic ablution, they return home, still observing the rigorous mle of silence. At Gavoi, another village of Sardinia, silence is also en\u00ad forced. Suppliants go at night to seek favoura, and pass the night in the chapel in prayer. The Sardinians celebrate numerous festivals through\u00ad out the year, at which the peasants' costumes provide the most wonderfully picturesque spectacle. Proces\u00ad sions with dancing and music are the chief part of the programme, and the pilgrims sleep either in the church porches or in the churches. Sick people come for healing, and practise incubation at several of the festi- ' Arckivia per Archivio, op. eit. vals of the island. In particular, the practice ia carried on at the feast of St. Cosmos and St. Damian, cele\u00ad brated at their church between Founi and Mamoiado; at the feast of S. Francesco, on 5th May. near Nuoro ; during the novena of the Madonna Gounari near Nuoro, in August; and at the feast of S. Efisio Pula near Cagliari, at the beginning of May. The same idea of the healing god entering into nature prevailed amongst the ancient Germans.' They be\u00ad lieved m only one healing god, Wotan-Odin. He had no intermediary priests, and was worshipped on the open hills in sacred places called Odinsacker, The cult was of the simplest, the forerunner of the open-air treatment. Odin was the god of light and warmth dis\u00ad pelling disease and demons. Sick children were laid out for his cure on the roof-tops, ^[en and women made pilgrimages to the hiUs, in search of healing. Water- cures were also pationised. Baths drove out demons. The suppliants offered sacrifices and went in silence, barefoot, before dawn. Money offerings were also given. Coins were dropped into the sacred well for the water-spirits. Survivals of these ancient customs are still to be found. At Mariazell, in Styria, incubation is practised at the prraent day. The church, a large buildmg with tour towers, is visited by 200,000 pilgrims each year. The attraction is a nairacle-working image of the Vir\u00ad gin, carved in lime-tree wood. It was given to the place in 1157, and now is enshrined in the inner sanc\u00ad tuary amongst rich silver offerings. The sick pilgrims come to worehip it, and sleep either in the church ' Uopt\u2014IfeilgOUer K. Heiht&Uen do Allertums, p. 54. 190 AUSTRIA or in the open-air near the church. Miraculous heal\u00ad ings, performed in the name of the Madonna, fre\u00ad quently take place, and there is a special spring of water for the cure of sore eyes. in. The Festival at Tenos The chureh of the Evangelistria, our Lady of the Annunciation, at Tenos is the scene of the chief annual festival of the Greek Chnrch, celebriited on the day of the Annnnciation, 2oib Maroh (o.s.). .\\ second great festival takes place on 15th August, -Assumption Day, at the same place. The saottity which attaches itself to these festivals is not derived from the antiquity of the chnrch or from old religious traditions belonging to the place. As a sacred island Tenos is yet in its childhood. Still, the close proximity of Delos, the Centre of the pagan religion, gives support to its claims to sanctity, for it seems as if some transference of sacred associations had been effected. Delos, where a wealthy town once flourished, with the mighty temple of Apollo among other smaller temples, whither from all parts used to come the greatest pilgrimage of the Greeks in their greatest days, where the theatre and stadium were scenes of splendid festivities, is now a little deserted island, and the ruins of its temples are being brought to light by excavators. Across a narrow stretch of the blue Aegean lies the gleaming white town of Tenos, with the church of the Virgin prominent in the background. In the faith of the modern Greeks this church takes the place of Apollo's temple in Delos. It is the Mecca of Greek religion, and every devout Greek desires to visit it once before death. The pilgrimages at these two festivals are the greatest in importance and multitude of any that are organised by the Greek Church. Their popularity is widespread. 192 THB FESTIVAL AT TENOS for pilgrims come to Tenos from Egypt, Asia, and Turkey, as well as from all the islands, and countries of the mainland. Yet a century ago Tenos was un\u00ad known in the religious world. The origin of the great sanctity now possessed by the island, and of the foun\u00ad dation of the church, belongs to the year 1821, when the War of Independence was begun. Some people still believe that a mysterious connection exists between the success of the war and the Madonna of Tenos, and regard her as a Liberator of Greece. It began with the common story of a dream and a sacred picture, which accounts for the foundation of so many Greek churches. In that year, one of the islanders, while sleeping, had a vision of the Panagia. She told him to go to a certain place outside the town and dig until he found her picture. He obeyed, but found nothing. His vision was confirmed the following year by a nun. Three times the Panagia appeared to her in sleep, and gave a similar command. The repetition of the racaaage perauaded the chief prieat that it waa of divine origin, and he instituted a search for the sacred picture. On the site designated in the visions were found the ruins of a chapel of St. John and a deep well, which now provides the holy water of the church. The cha|)el of St. John had been burned in 1200 by the Saracens, and it is probable that it stood on the site of an ancient temple, for many old marbloa were found during the excavations. Thus the site had long been sacred. Here the Bishop built a small chapel, which is now the crypt of the larger church, and is known as the Chapel of the Well or of the Discovery. It was finished in 1823, and just aa till' building was almost completed, one of the work-THE FESTIVAL AT TBNOS 193 men found the long looked for picture. It was much destroyed, for during the excavations, it had been cut in two. and had previously been burned, so that it presented a black and charred appearance. Still, they welcomed it as a masterpiece by St. Luke, though they could distinguish only the heads of the Panagia and the Archangel (jabriel. From the time of its discovery miracles were attributed to it. Plague was raging on the island, and by means of the picture many cures were wrought, and the plague was stamjied out. The picture was believed to be sent from heaven by the direct agency of the Panagia for the benefit of the Teniotos and of all the world. The rational explana\u00ad tion of its presence is not hard to seek. Like the well, it had belonged to the ancient church of St. John. The discovery of the picture gave new impetus to religious zeal and to liberality, and the building of the large chureh was begun. This is the church of the Evangelistria, which to-day ia the richest in Greece. Built of marble quarried on the island, it has an im\u00ad posing square frontage, with a tall campanile, and a wide double stairway leading to the entrance door. Inside are many rich adornments and votive offerings of the greatest value and othera of the humblest description. The sacred picture lies on one of the many shrines which stand in the church. It is enclosed in a glass case and only the heads, little black objects, of the Madonna and the Archangel are visible. All the rest is covered with silver and precious atones, so that the effect is of the greatest richness. In front of the church and at the two sides are large square courte, surrounded by wide porticos, which are used as 194 THE FESTIVAL AT TENOS sleeping-places for the pilgrims. The little chapel of the well is the holy of holies. Over the door is an inscription telling that this waa the place where the discovery was made. Entering, one finds it a long narrow crypt. On the left, near the door, is the spot, marked by a shrine, where the picture was found. Farther up is the sacred well. Other shrines stand along the walls, and at the top is an altar of the Aladonna. Several crypts open off this chief chapel. They are used for various ceremonies, such aa the baptism of the numerous babies brought to the festival- Many of the crypta provide a lodging place for family parties of pilgrims. The whole establish\u00ad ment of the church is necessarily large, for the pilgrim\u00ad ages bring multitudes of people. In former yeara the average was 45,000, but ihis year only about 15,000 people came. The decrease was not due to waning popularity, but to the fact that many were detained at home by the parliaiiU'iitary elections which were then being held. The whole week of the Annunciation is a festal time in Tenos, Every day boats bring their loads of pil\u00ad grims. Steamers come from Athens, Egypt, Smyrna, and Constantinople, and little ca!ques convey the neigh\u00ad bouring islandera. The chief events take place on the eve and the day of the Annunciation. By that time all have arrived, and the little village of Tenos is transformed into a busy metropolis The pilgrims wear gala attire, and the gay costumes of the peaaonts who throng the courtyards make a bright and attractive picture amid the white marble of the buildings. The approach to the church is by a narrow flagged street, the Sacred Way of Tenoa. At the festival it is lined THE FESTIVAL .^T TEKOS 195 with booths, where one can buy all sorts of curios and souvenire. In the central court of the church are other booths, presided over by priests. For small sums they sell silver Madonnas or crucifixes; or if gratitude for health restored has to be expressed, one can have silver eyes, hearts, legs, and arms in any quantity. These festive scenes, however, may be witnessed in other parts of Greece at the time of local festivals. The chief interest attached to this gathering at Tenos lies in the healing of the sick, which is the special feature of the pilgrimage. The sacred picture exercised from the beginning miraculous curative powera, the belief in which is deep-rooted in the minds of the Greeks. They still show the love of processional display which gives rise to such pilgrimages, and they keep also the impressionable minds of their forefathera, who had recourse to the temples of healing gods in times of sickness. All devout sufferers appeal to the Madonna of Tenos to help them. If they cannot leave home, they make some vow in order to entice her help away from the church, or they may send their relatives to the festival to intercede for them there, as the Madonna is believed to be more accessible at her chureh and on her feast-day- Those who at all are able join the pilgrimage, and, as the boats unload, many mvalids are dragged on shore and conveyed up the Sacred Way. On the morning before Annunciation Day this year, the pilgrims could be seen making their way to the church. Among them were cripples, armless and leg\u00ad less, half-rolling up the street; blind people groping their way along; men and women with deformities of every kind : one or two showing the pallor of death on their faces were being carried up on litters. These 196 THE FESTIVAL AT TENOS evidently were coming to Tenoa as a last resource, when doctors were of no avail. Other pilgrims were ascending after their own fashion, according to vows they had made. One woman toiled laboriously along on her knees, kissing the stones of the way, and clasping a silver Madonna and Child, Last year her daughter had been seized with epilepsy, and she vowed to carry in this way this offering to the Madonna of Tenos if she would cure her daughter. The girl recovered and the mother now with thankful heart was fulfilling her part of the The evo of Annunciation Day is the time when the Panagia is believed to descend among the sick and work miraculous cures upon them. Then all the patients arc gathered together in the crypt or in the upper church. The Chapel of the Well is the popular place for incubation. There is more chance of mira\u00ad culous cure there than in the church. The little crypt can accommodate only a comparatively small number, but they are packed together as tightly as possible. From the entrance up to the altar, they lie in two lines of three or four deep, with a passage down the middle large enough for only one person. Down this narrow way two streams of people press the whole evening. They worship at the shrines along the wall, purchase holy earth from the spot where the picture was discovered, drink at the sacred well, and are blessed by the priest at the altar. The cripples and the sick desiring healing have been engaged all day m auch acts of worship; they have received bread and water from the priests in tho upper church, paid homage to the all-powerful picture, offered their caudles to the THB FESTIVAL AT TBNOS 197 Madonna, and all the time sought to endue themselves with her presence. Now at night, still fixing thek thoughts on her, and permeated by this spirit of wor\u00ad ship, they settle down to sleep in order that she may appear to them in a dream. The atmosphere of the crypt with such a crowd ever present can be imagined, and it is no wonder that a kind of stupor seemed to be the general state of the people who were lying awaiting cure. Later on they fell asleep. The usual kinds of diseases were repre\u00ad sented among the pilgrims. The general type remains the same as in the inscriptions of Epidauros. Blind men and cripples, paralytics ond epileptics, and deformed people of every kind, were the most pro\u00ad minent. Insane men and women were also brought for cure. As I passed through the Chapel of the Well, a demoniac woman was standing by the shrine of the Discovery. She became suddenly violent and buret out upon the byatandera. Her raving was calmed by one of the priests, who silenced her by holding up the crucifix before her. In the upper church similar scenes on a larger scale were being enacted. Those who had been un\u00ad able to find room in the crypt were installed for the night round the various shrines in the great church. Some were lying face downwards on the floor, seeking to inhale the sacred air coming from the crypt below. They believed it to be specially beneficial for the eye\u00ad sight, but nothing except religious enthusiasm could have distinguished it from poisonous gases. The idea at the root of the whole performance is simply the ancient act of incubation. The Panagia would visit them, her trae followers and worahippers, as 198 THE FESTIVAL AT TEKOS they lay piously in the church whither she was wont to come on her feast-day. She would appear to them in a vision, give them her blessing, and in the morning they would joyously awake and find themselves cured. Disappointment, of course, awaits the vast majority, but on the evening of the vigil all are filled with hope. They know the precedents of former yeare, how such things have happened to some fortunate people among the pilgrims every year. Usually eight or nine miracles take place, and lists of them are published for distribution, but this year the ofBcials of the church decided to stop printing the list, because it has been said that it was used as an advertisement, and reflected unfavourably upon the disinterestedness of the church. The church records contain accounts of the miracles which now amount to many hundreds. They are practically all of the type I have described\u2014cure during a vision while incubation was practised. For example, the case of a man from Moldavia is on record. He had become paralysed during a nighf-watch, and the doctora could effect no relief. He was taken to the Chapel of the Well, and when asleep he thought he heard a voice telling him to arise. He awoke, thought it was a dream, and fell asleep again. A second time he heard a voice, and saw a white-robed woman of great beauty entering the chureh. In his fear he rose and walked about. His recovery was so complete that he could walk iu the procession round the town the following day, Tenos has always been especially famed for the cure of blindness. The records show a great preponderant of miracles on blind men, and at the present-day festivals one sees how many sightless people are led THB FESTIVAL AT TENOS 199 up for incubation. Also, the number of votive eyes exceeds that of other parts of the body. Thia year one of the miracles that took place was a cure of bHndneas. On the Friday morning I saw a blind man, a Greek, who was totally unable to see. He spent tho day in acts of devotion to the Panag^, and aU night he lay in the Chapel of the Well along with the other pilgrims. As he slept, he dreamt that the Panagia came to him, and blessed him, touching his eyes with her hand. Then he awoke, and found that his eye\u00ad sight had been restored, and he could see as other men. Mediums of cure, such as holy water or aacred earth from the crypt, are often used. The records tell of one Nicholas, from Asia Minor, who injured an eye while working at marble. He went to the church, wor\u00ad shipped the picture, and deacended to the crypt. While bathing his eye with holy water, a piece of marble fell out and he was cured. A woman of Tenos, who was blind, heard of the miracles wrought by the picture, and went to the church full of faith. She there recovered her eye\u00ad sight by special favour of the Virgin. It is a custom of the pilgrims to kiss the glass case which covere the picture, and then to rub the glass with a small piece of cotton-wool. This serves thereafter as an amulet, and is beHeved to have great curative powers, especially for the eyesight. An Athenian had lost the sight of both eyes, and came to Tenos in search of cure. He lay in the church before the picture, and near him was an insane woman. She said that she saw sweat running off the picture. The man told her to wipe it, and then anoint his eyes. She did so, and they were both cured. Other cures have been wrought with 200 TIlE FESTIVAL AT TENOS the sacred oil from the church lamp. Pilgrims often dip their handkerchiefs in the oil, and keep them as charms against sickness. The morning after the night of incubation is a time of rejoicing tor the favoured few, but it is the saddest sight of all to see the cripples, and paralytics, and the other sufferers being conveyed down the Sacred Way, which they had ascended in hope so short a time before. Still, one more chance of cure remains. At 10 a.m. on Annunciation Day a great procession takes place. The Archbishop and priests start from the church, and make the round of the town, bearing the holy picture. First comes the Archbishop, and behind him one of the chief priests, who carries the precious burden. As they descend the stairway in front of the church, on all the steps are lying cripples and aick people, who wish the holy men to cure them by passing over- The Archbishop carefully plants a foot on each as he goes down. This carpeting of human bodies extends for some distance down the Sacred Way, The belief which is cherished in the benefits ac\u00ad cruing from a pilgrimage to Tenos is clearly visible in the multitude of votive offenngs which adorn the church, and in the flourishing state of the church finances. No compulsory charge is levied on pilgrims who receive benefit in the church- .\\s in the temples, it ia left to their own discretion. One aees the hum\u00ad blest offerings and the very richest, given according to the means of the donor. The fine marble well which stands in the court was the gift of a grateful Turk. Inside the church are quantities of silver voti\\e offer\u00ad ings. The number of these gets so great that regularly they are melted down, and used for the upkeep of the THE FESTIVAL AT TENOS 201 chnrch. Poor girls offer up their hair, the long plaits which have been their chief pride. Money also is collected, and all the pilgrims contribute to some extent, if they wish for blessing to come to them from the pilgrimage. IV, The Greek Islands MYTILENE.\u2014^In the Greek islands many of the most primitive customs aie prevalent at the present day. The isolation of the inhabitants prevents them from becoming quickly modernised. Tenos, with its great festival, I have already described. In Mytilene* a simi\u00ad lar panegyris ia held. In former years its importance was as great as that of Tenos, but the latter has now taken the first place in church festivals, and the renown of the Madonna of Lesbos has faded. Still pilgrims to the church of Ayassos come in crowds on Assump\u00ad tion Day, and many cures are performed- Ayassos is situated on the slope of Mt. Olympos in the south-east of the island. The church is large, and round about are little cells for the lodging of pilgrims. A wooden picture of the Virgin is the centre of attrws tion. On the eve of the feast-day the pilgrims pass the night in the chureh, lying on mattresses and rags. In the morning the picture is carried round amon^ them as tlii>y lie there. The priest steps on the people as he carries the picture, and extends to them healing virtue. In the church is a large collection of votive offerings for recovery from sickness. In other parts of Mytilene also, miraculous cures are performed,* St, Therapon, whose name deuotes healing powers, is a patron saint of the island. Newton,' in the middle of last century, visited a 'BB app,, p. 3*9-little chapel of St Therapon near Acherona, and found that It wos the custom for the sick to remain there three or four davrf. The priest performed mass for them, and they passed the time iu prayer and sleep, \\Vhen health was successfully recovered, the patient, on leaving, hung up a rag from his clothing on a tree near the chapel. Newton saw the bush covered with old shreds of clothes. At the present day the chapel and tree are scenes of similar rites. It is believed that here was the site of the Asklepieion, St. Therapon the Healer taking the place of Asklepios. The hanging of rags on a tree or bush as a token of a malady left behind, or as a sign of the suppliant's desire for cure, is a widespread custom. It arises from the belief that an evil can be transferred from oneself to an inanimate object, by the agency of a rag. Disease is regarded as something hostile and concrete that must be expelled. Travellers have noted the custom in various parts of Greece and Asia Mmor. It forms part of a curious religious rite at Tekekioi in Upper Macedonia.' On St. George's Day a pilgrimage is made to a sacred stone. Near the stone is a thorn tree which is adorned with rags of all colours, left by ffiick people who have been cured there. In Athens, mothers bring their children to the church of St. Manna, undress them there, and leave behind the clothes, thinking to leave also the disease. In Samoth- raee, Conzc- has noted the survival of many old auiier- stitions in connection with the numerous little churehes which are built on ancient sacred sites, and amongst '^Jour. HeUeii. Studies, V. 21, EvaoB\u2014J/ycennean Tru wtd Pillar Chk. ' Btiat a-ri/lhrai. Mtera. these customs is preserved that of hanging on the rocks near the church parts of the clothing of sick people who These offerings are to be distinguished from the es- voto which are dedicated after release from disease. Clothes are sometimes offered up after the god has granted the cure. Amongst the Chaldeans,' in the Tugari country, a woman, when ill, makes a vow to offer up one or more dresses upon recovery. When she gets well, she takes the gifts to the church, and hangs the clothes up there. The transference of disease to an inanimate object is believed to be effected also by means of threads. They are used especially for fever cases. In the little church of St. John at Athens, numerous examples can any day be seen. It is a rectangular building enclosing a column which projects through the roof. Great sanc\u00ad tity IS attributed to thia pillar, and on it waxed threads, black, red, and white, are fixed in great numbers. They are stuck there by people who have prayed to the aaint to cure some friend or relative of fever. The legend relates that St. John himself instituted the cuatom before ho died, in order that the cure of fevers, which he had carried on in life, might be continued by him after death. In Kariiathoa^ a priest tiea a red thread round the neck of a fever patient. His friends take it off in the morning and tie it to a tree, thinking thereby to transfer the disease. The custom is found also in Crete,^ Two firat-bom children, called Maria, bind a thread on the neck of 'Ainfliworth\u2014rmneft iH Aiia iliaar, ii. 255. ' I'uliifs\u2014AtXTtov, ISS.!, p. 1. MYTILENE 205 the fever-patient. Then one takes it off and fastens it round a tree, while the other asks her what she is binding. She answera that it is the fever of the patient. Three times question and answer are repeated, and thereafter they depart and expect a complete re\u00ad covery. In the north of M}tilene there ia another church to which pilgrimages are mode. This is the church of St. Michael at Mandam&dos.' The panegyris is held at Easter, and many people come to receive healing from the Archangel. The church haa aquare courtyarda sur\u00ad rounded by the little cells which are usually found where incubation is practised. At the festival time they are filled with pilgrims- Sick people visit the church at other seasons also. Two monks and a nun care for the sick. The attraction is a little black image of St, Michael, made of piaster. It is invested with miracu\u00ad lous powers of healing the sick. When Mr. Eouse visited MandamAdos, there were two votive coins fixed on its forehead. This practice of offering money to the deity by sticking coins on his statue was in vogue amongst the ancients. Lucian' tells of a Cretan statue round which obols were lying, while to its limbs were fixed silver coins and plate, the thank-offerings of people who had been cured of fever. In the monastery of Zambika on Rhodes, Newton* saw people sticking gold coins on to the faces of saints during the Eaater festival. Also in Mytilene, at St. Michael's monastery near Acherona, he saw a picture of the Panagia to which was affixed a Turkish coin, ' British School Anntuii, 1893-9S. Roiwe\u2014iesftiw. ' Philopiewks\u2014Ed. Frankfort, p. 248. Traetls in the Levant, i. 182. 206 CYCLADES and attached to the pu ture was a littie silver hand with a list of names of persons who had been cured. This is a modern parallel to the list of Epidaurian cures- Coins are often used iu this way as a means of con\u00ad sulting an oracle. At Chalchis in Euboea, coins are applied to the sacred pictorc in the church of St. Paraskevi.' If they stick firmly, the wish of the con\u00ad sultant is granted; if they fall, he will be disappointed. Similarly, Wheler^ saw in Corfu a miraculous picture of the Madonna which is consulted by people who wish to be informed of their friends' safety. If these are alive, the money sticks to the picture, but drops down if they have died. By either way the priest acquires the coins. THE CYCLADES.\u2014The inhabitants of the lesser Cyclades keep np many of the ancient super\u00ad stitions and beliefs, and seek to obtain cures of diseases by the primitive methods. Incuba\u00ad tion ia a common practice, and often attached to it are other rites and ceremonies. In Seriphos,^ the monastery of St. Michael is visited by the sick. Bent tells of a woman who was cured after remaining there for forty days. She was believed to be under the in\u00ad fluence of the Nereids, who figure prominently in the superstitions of the islanders. They are held reapons- ible for ailments of children who fall iU without clear cauae. A coinnion cure for a sick child, who is believed to hove been struck by the Neieids, is to take him to the church and leave him there, so that the saint may BodiJ\u2014CWonifl Biiil iMre of Modtrn Grteee, p. 154, ' Journey into Orteet, p. 30.

The cure is heroic, but if the child dies, it is believed to be the working of God's will, and not the fault of the treatment. In Keos and Andros children are taken to the church, stripped there, and then dressed in new clothes which have been blessed by the priest. The church of St. Katharine, on Kimolos,\" has a predouB picture of the Panagia as Leader, which is credited with the faculty of curing insanity. Bent, when visiting the church, saw a madman who had been brought to pa^ the night in the church. His friends were zealously praying to the Virgin for him, but no improvement in his condition could be observed. CYFHUS.\u2014The island of Cyprus is famous for the great number of springs to which are attributed healing virtues. Beside them has often been built a small chapel dedicated to a saint. Thither pilgrims resort and pass the night, after due devotions to the saint. At the same time they seek to benefit themselves by using the holy water. Near Ammochostos,' for example, is one of the best- known of these springs. The large Byzantine church of St, Barnabas has a little chapel beside it, in which IS the grave of the saint, and also a mineral well much frequented by sick people. The water is believed to have great healing properties. It comes up through the floor of the chapel, where the patients sleep. When they depart cured, they hang part of their clothing on the walls aa a votive offering, 'Op. at., p. 61. 'Q!i.cil.,-p.il. Eosa\u2014Jflsefreisen, iv. IB, 208 THE IONIAN ISLANDS At the monastery of Hagios Neophytos incubation is practised at the present day. The monastery' stands in a well-watered valley on the slope of the Pano- Orodhea and is surrounded by olive and orange groves. On the opixiaite side of the valley is a small chapel where the sick pilgrims, who come in great numbera, practise incubation. This chapel, which is approached by a staircase built on the face of the cliff, was origin\u00ad ally the cavc-dwelling of the Saint who gives his name to the monastery. One can see a coffin-shaped bed excavated in a recess of the rock. Into this bed the pilgrims climb, and turn round thrice. At the foot of the cliff is a holy well with heaUng properties. CORFU.\u2014Each of the Ionian Islands has its special saint who acts towards the inhabitants as protector and healer In Kephalenia St. Gerasimo is all-powerful, in Zante St Dionysios, and in Corfu St. Spiridion, The town of Corfu contains a large church dedicated to St. Spiridion,* whose tomb is there. His body lies in a silver sarcophagus. A hideous mummy can be seen. It is believed to be the body of the saint in a state of miraculous preservation. Many superatitions are still attached to this mummy-saint. On his festi\u00ad val day, 25th December, the sick are laid in the street. BO that the procession may pass over them, and they may be cured When they come to the church to practice incubation, and are unsuccessful in obtainiag a cure, the priest says that the saint is away from his chapel, out on the sea helping sailora in distress, -As a proof, when he returns from this mission of mercy, ' Hiigjirth\u2014/itoia Cfpria, p. 21. Tuokerniiiii\u201477i\u00ab 209 they d^play sea-weed and other signs of his voyage which he has brought back- South of the town of Zante is a small chapel which contains the bones of St, Dionysios,^ He continues to work miracles, as he did in bis life-time. He either appears to sick people in his church, seni^ dreams to sleeping suppliants, or cures by a touch of the rehcs. He has three feast-days, when he is most ready to hear auppHcationa and confer favoura. At the December festival parents often pass the night with their sick children in the church. They seek to coax the saint with offerings, and each December he receives a new pair of sho^. The old pair is cut into pieces, which are distributed as amulets of great curative powera- BHODBS,\u2014On the north-west coast of Rhodes is situ\u00ad ated the village of Kremastos, An annual festival is held there on Assumption Day and on the ninth day after that date. It is the moat important feaat of the Virgin held in the island at the preaent time. In the first half of the nineteenth century the great panegyris of Rhodes waa held at Lindos in the south, and health-miracles were performed there. To-day one can still aee in the church of the Panagia votive offer\u00ad ings which attest the fact. But about forty years ago a murder was committed during the riotous festivities, and the priests resolved to discontinue the festival at Lindos and transfer it to the monastery of Spous, about two hours distant from the town. At Spous the fes\u00ad tival did not flourish long. Disorderly proceedings again made it impossible to continue the celebrations, ' Schmidt\u2014iJie Insd Zakynthoa. 210 RHODES and from that time the panegyris of the Panagia has been held at Kremastos, Every year great crowds attend. Not only do islandera come, but from the mainlond also pilgrims assemble, and amongst them are Turks and Jews, who seek to be cured by the Christian Panagia. The church has been re-built lately, and, as at Tenos, rooms are provided round about for the accommodation of the pilgrims. They sleep either in these rooms or in the church, and twice daily worship the sacred picture, which is possessed of miraculous powers. In some cases a long stay of several months is made before the feast day, when the pilgrim hop^ to have his devo\u00ad tion rewarded. The miracles are of the same nature as at Tenos, and an official list of them is kept at the chureh, where the votive offerings also show the nature of the cures. I shall take one example of a miracle which occurred three years ago. A deaf and dumb man stayed at the church for four months, duly performing the religious rites. On the feaat day he was cured. During his sleep on the previous night he saw in a dream a darkly- dressed woman, who told him he would be cured the next day. At the feast he suddenly cried out: \" Glory to God,\" and so found he had recovered his speech. V. The Mainland of Greece -\\RoOLiS-\u2014In the little country chapels scattered throughout -Argolis, incubation is occasionally prac\u00ad tised, and miracles of healing are wrought at the time of the panegyris. East of Tiryns ia a Mt. St. Elias. On the top of it stands a small chapel, to which a pilgrimage ia made on 20th July, the saints day. Sick people join the pilgrimage, and ascend to the chnrch to spend the night in hope of receiving divine healing. Near Nauplia is a large church of the An\u00ad nunciation, where incubation is practised. Thefcstival, on 26th March, is largely attended, particularly by blind people, for eyesight has often been restored by the Panagia on that day. In the same district there is another church to which sick people, and especially lunatics, are token. It is a small white monastery of the Virgin, half-way up the Larisa, the acropolis of Argos. The festival is held on the 20th November, and the sick pass the night in the church. Those who are fortunate enough find themselves cured in the morning, ARCADIA.\u2014The Panagia has another white monastery on the side of a rocky mountain in Arcadia, between Tripolis and Mantinea, On the 15th August the fes\u00ad tival takes place, and hundreds of sick people make the pilgrimage each year, but out of the crowd only seven or eight receive healing. AcHAiA.\u2014The largest and richest monastery of Greece is situated in the north of Achaia, two hours' 212 ACHAIA ride from the town of Kalavryta. It derives its name of Megaspelaion from the huge cavern in which it is built. The situation is romantic and picturesque. Standing on the face of a precipice 3tX) feet high, the monastery looka down from a great height on a narrow ravine of remarkable beauty. A miraculous picture brings pilgrims to thia remote place. They come to worship it at the festival on 15th August, and the sick practise incubation in the chapel. The picture was discovered by Euphrosine, a princess of Constantinople, who lived in the village on the opposite side of the valley. Crudenesa is its chief characteristic aa a work of art, but like the similar picture at Tenoa, it is attri\u00ad buted to St. Luke. Euphrosine found it in the cavern beside a well, where now there is a small shrine of the Virgin, with a picture suspended above. The miraculous picture itself stands in a special shrine in a corner on the right-hand side of the church. It ia surrounded with silver and precious stones, and only the black heads of the Madonna and Child are visible. At the time of my visit, a long silver arm waa suspended above, the votive-offering of some sick person who attributed his cure to the Panagia. The number of people who come to this monastery is not large, for there ia no accommodation for crowds. After performing due devotions and worahipping at the picture-shrine, the sick aupplianta go to pass the night in a side-chapel, which ia entered by a separate stairway. It is divided into an inner shrine and an outer room, where the patienta sleep. There is not apace for more than half-a-dozen people, and rarely more than three or four come at the same time. During the night those suppliants who are favoured with a PHOCiS AND BOETIA 213 vision see the \\'irgin before them. She blesses them, and in the morning they wake up cured. The monks say that especially paralytics and people with nervous affections are successfully cured. PHOCIS AND BOEOTIA.\u2014Another great monastery of Greece is that of St. Luke of Stiria^ in Phocis, On 25ih Jnne the panegyris of the saint is held, and a large gathering from all parts assembles at the monas\u00ad tery. Amongst them are many sick people, who sleep during the night in the church where is the tomb of the saint. St. Luke Stiriotes lived in the ninth cen\u00ad tury, and wrought many miracles during his lifetime. After his death his relics continued to work miracles, and a monastery and chureh were built in his honour at the tomb. In the 17th centnry, Spon and Wheler visited the monastery, and they relate that cures were frequent and successful. The place of incubation in their day was a covered room dedicated to St. Sopito between the large church and a smaller chapel of the Virgin, Now incubation is practised at the tomb in the church. St. Luke is noted for the cure of demoniacs, who recover their reason while practising incubation at his tomb. Lepers and blind people also are frequently cured. A small sarcophagus is shown in the church as the original tomb of the aaint, and on each aide of it is a marble slab which miraculously exudes ointment. This ointment is believed to be possessed of great thera\u00ad peutic virtue. The neighbourhood of Mt. Parnassos has several other churches where the custom of incubation is preva- ' ScbnltE and Bamsley\u2014Monaitery of St. Lale at Sliriii. 214 LACONIA lent. At the Jerusalem monastery near the village of Daulia, on the slopes of the mountains, sick people, who have been given up as incurable, go to reside, and sleep every night beside the sacred pietiire. During the day they serve in the monastery, dedicating themselves to the Panagia, until she sees fit to cure them. Some\u00ad times their devotion is rewarded and they depart with health restored. In the little village of Arachova, perched 4,000 feet up in the valley of Delphi, the church of St. George is the scene of many miraculous cures. It is a large building with a campanile, and inside are the ordinary shrines and pictures. A screen shuts off the east end of the church. It is covered with pictures of various saints, and most prominent among them is a glaringly new picture, in a rich gilt frame, of St. George killing the dragon. This crude work of art is highly prized by the natives on account of the hnposkig frame It is the votive offering of a Hussian, who came a para\u00ad lytic to Arachova in July, 1905. He spent several weeks praying and sleeping in the chureh, ond departed completely cured. The festival of St. George is held on 23rd April, They have three days of dancing and feasting, and at night all suppliants bring their ruga and sleep round the shrines in the chureh. Every year many of the sick are found to be cured when morning LACO-\\I,\\.\u2014Near Sjarta is the ruined Franco-Turkish fort of Miatra, Half way up tho citadel, which rises to 2000 feet, ia the large church of the Pontanaasa- Its tall campanile looks down on the lovely valley of the Eurotas. Thia church was visited by Pouqueville' p, \u00ab* LACONIA 215 in tbe beginning of last century. He tells how the sick were brought daily and laid at the door of the church, so that the worshippera passing by might indicate to them the remedies which would restore them to health. Only melancholia and insanity were thus cured miracu\u00ad lously, for these maladies were attributed to the devil's influence. Begular incubation is now practised in the church. The sick frequent it in great numbers, and are cared for by tihe nuns who dwell in the church. These nuns say that the sick people, when sleeping in the church, have a dream of the Madonna, and when they awoke they are found to be cured of all disease. In connection with the church is a sacred well, the watera of which are believed to be curative. A votive picture, which hangs to the right of the altar in the church, represents this well. A man lies asleep or dead. Above him is the fountain at which many people are drinking, while others are pouring water from it on the man's breast. Throughout Laconia there are other centres of in\u00ad cubation. At the village of Anavryti near Sparta is the monastery of the Panagia Phaneromene. The story of its foundation is the usual one of a discovered picture. In obedience to a command conveyed in a dream, a monk dug and found this picture. Now he keeps the monastery, and flourishes on the proceeds of the festival. It is held on 9th February, and sick people come to pass the night in the church. Cures of disease take place after they have thus practised incubation. In Cynuria, at the chureh of the Panagia Elono, there is a yearly festival, also frequented by sick people. 216 BALDKLl They drink from the sacred fountain, and sleep in the church. Some miracles are wrought each year. The largest monastery in Laconia is the Hagioi Tesserakontes, near Therapne. The festival on March 22nd is a great event in the district, and pilgrims come from long distances to attend it. Incubation is prac\u00ad tised in tbe church, and miracles of healing are per\u00ad formed on blind people, cripples, and paralytics especially. Another centre of cures is the church of the Panagia latrissa (the Doctor Madonna) which stands on the ridge of Mt. Taygetos, one day's ride from Sparta. It is a little chapel, and has a court with cells all round it. In these cells the invalid pilgrims stay. Many consumptives come, and combine ancient and modern methods of cure. They practise incubation and pray regularly to the Panagia in the church, and at the same time they have open-air treatment, breathing the fine mountam air. After a aummer spent thus, they are often cured, and the Panagia receives the credit. It is noteworthy that on the other side of the ridge there is a regular sanatorium for consumptives. BALUELI,\u2014A similar health resort exists for the Greeks of Constantinople at the church of St. Mary- at-the-Well, at Balukli. It stands half a mile from the Silivri Kapusi, and was built by Justinian the Great out of materials left over from the building of St. Sophia, The holy well was discovered in the time of Leo the Great, and has been famous since that date for miraculous cures. It is in the crypt below the church, and is reached by a flight of steps, Cups are provided, and the water is cool and good. The crypt BALDKLI 217 is a primitive Kurhaus for those who come to Balukli in search of health. The groves of trees and the plea\u00ad sant country make it a favourite resort. The visitors drink the holy water, frequent the church at the time of prayera, and occasionally sleep for a night in it. Then cure sometimes comes to them. A special crowd attends at the festival time on the Friday of Greek Easter week. VI. Cyzicus The district of Cyzicua in the north of Asia Minor shows many relics of paganism. Shrines of heroes and gods, now chapels of saints, are scattered over the country. The worship of the Archangel Michael is prevalent, and we have already seen that incubation is a part of bis cult. In pagan days, also, it would seem that incubation was a common practice of the district. Near Mihalliteh, half-way between Brusa and Cyzicus, a votive tablet,^ referring to the subject, was found. It is an ex-voto to Zeus Hypsistos of the thunderbolt. Above is Zeus, sceptre in left hand and thunderbolt in right, and the eagle at his feet. Before bim is a lighted altar, and to the left stands Hermes with a caduceus on hia right shoulder. Between the gods is a high triangular object, probably an offering. Below is a man lying down. He must be the dedicator, and in his dedication he says that he makes the offering at his own expense, according to command\u2014which is the usual formula for a command given in a heavenly vision. His position points to the fact that he received the command in a dream, Zeus Hypsistos was worshipped as a healer, and probably he saved the man's life when he was in danger of being struck by a thunderbolt. If we may infer from this tablet thnt incubation was practised at thia place, it is of importance for the sub\u00ad ject, because at the present day there is a church of ' Lo TlM ot WMidioBtaa\u2014Vo^/as* m Aiit Miaturt, p. 274. cizicus 219 St. Michael in the neighbourhood where the practice is regularly carried on. This is the church of the village of Ulubad on the river Bhyndakos- Nothing is known of Ulubad before Byzantine times when it was called Lopadion, but it may be identified with the Heroes' Fort on the Ehyndakos- The church is small and insignificant, and is dedicated to the Arch\u00ad angel Michael- It is said to have been built two hundred years ago, and was visited in the middle of last century by Macfarlane* who found incubation going on when he entered- Before the altar screen two littie children were lying stretched on mattresses. The boy had fallen from his horse and injured his knee-cap. The little girl was suffering from inter\u00ad mittent fever. They lay there all day and all night without any change for the better. The father of the boy explained that -irant of money prevented him from sending his child to a doctor at Constantinople. At the present day similar ceremonies are performed. The festival is held on 6th Septemi^r, and pilgrimages are then made to the church- The holy well is much used for ablutions, and special homage is paid to a sacred picture of the Mf^onna. A copy of this picture is lent out occasioimlly for the benefit of sick people who are unable to a)me to the church. A specml feature of this church at Ulubad is the cure ol insanity. Madmen are often brought there by their relatives, and left chained to a beam, in the hope that the Madonna or St. Michael will restore their mental equilibrium. If no cure is vouchsafed, then the case ia given up as hopeless. Another centre of incubation is the church of Syk^, 1 Twliey amd Us Dutiny, i 410. 220 CYZICDS a large village one hour west of Mudania, on the site of Cacsarea Germanica, The church stands on the crest of a hill overlooking the sea and the island of Kalo- limno, and is dedicated to the holy Taxiarchs. St. Gabriel, however, does not appear in practice. Only St, Michael is worshipped. The church is said to have been built in the 8th century by Ckjnstantinua Porphy- rogenitus. CoveP visited it in the 17th century and found that miraculous cures of disease were effected at that time in the church. Macfarlane saw this church at the same time that he visited Ulubad. He learned that health miracles through incubation were commonly performed, and the church was especially noted for the cure of demoniacs. The priest told him that tbe friends of an insane man had to bring him on a mattress, and lay him before the altar, leaving him two or three days and nights under the care of the saints and priests. They ascribed the cure, which waa sometimes successful, to the sanctity which pervaded the atmosphere, and to the calming influence of a pic\u00ad ture of St. George of Cappodocia which they usually hung up in front of tbe patient. .'\\t the time of Macfarlane's visit no sick people were in the church, but a patient was expected, and the mattresses, which were hired out, were being aired in preparation. The church was said to be patronised by Turks also, and cures were sometimes wrought on insane Mohamme\u00ad dans. At the present day it is both affirmed and denied that Turks come to the church for cure, but, if true, it is not without parallel. Turks come to the Greek festi\u00ad val at Tenos, and the marble fount-ain, which stands in the court and is used for purifications, waa the votive .MS-!, Mua. 22914. offering of a Turkish who waa cured of paralyse when worahippmg the aacred picture. The pilgrimage to Syke is held on 6th September, and people join it from all parts of the country, even from Constantinople. The church ia frequented by the sick at other times also, but the cure does not come in one night. The patients have to make a prolonged residence on fasting diet, usirally for forty days, in the western chapel, but the period is variable. As in the Middle Ages, the priest reads the Scriptures to them and to the lunatics, who are kept in a side room. A door with a grating leads from the church into this room, where the maniacs are kept chained up. A third church of this kind in the district is the Panagia Phanerom^n^ at Kapu Dagh- The village replaces the ancient Dindymene. A festival is held on 22nd May, but incubation is practised all the year round. As at Syke, the ordinary period of stay in the church is forty days, but a man at the church asserted this year that he had himself looked after o chained lunatic for three months. The cure is effected by placing the sacred picture, a large and heavy one of the Madonna, in the patient's hands while the priest reads the gospel. The picture is said to produce contortions in the patient but not to hurt him. This treatment is especially efficacious for lunacy. One informant said that he himself had seen a bent woman of thirty-three years made straight by this treatment. She was also hump-backed, but waa not cured of that. The son of a Turk was cured of blindness, and the father cornea every year to give thanks, but does not become con\u00ad verted to Chriatianity. Gbemlek, on the Sea of Marmora, is the modern 22Si CYZICUS town on the site of Cius, an ancient city of Bithynia, At tbe church of the Panagia Pbanerom^n^ there incubation is now practised. Sick people come at any time of the year, and remain in the church for the usual period of forty days, observing a fasting diet. A miraculous picture of the Virgin is believed to effect the cures. The church of the Assumption at Isnik possesses another of these miraculous pitturcs of the Virgin. Isnik is situated on Lake Isnik, on the site of Nicaea in Bithynia. To this church lunatics are frequently brought, and are left for three days and nights on fasting diet. If they are inclined to be violent, they are chained to marble columns in the south aisle. Two other churches of this neighbourhood are men\u00ad tioned in Covel's manuscript. Of the church of the Panagia at Montania he says: \"There was a poor man with sore eyes had brought his bed and lay in the nave of the church to make his devotions to the Panagia in order to effect a cure.\" And at Trepejick; \" There are more Greekes there and they boast a little church there dedicated to Michael as it hath been ever since the Apostle's time; upon his feast day, all the people round about, some Turkes as well as tireiJies, repair thither for cure of most diseases which there especially is said to be cffectuall.\" The treatment of lunatics in these churches ot Cyzicus resembles that given in the monastery of St. Naum in Macedonia.' The monaster;- is sitoatod at the south end of Lake Ochrida, six houre south of the village of Ochrida, and it provides hospitality for tra- ' M. A. WnlLoi - Through Mnevdonia to the Albanian Lai-a. vellere. St. Naum founded it in the eighth century. The cure of lunatics gives it its chief fame. They are brought from all parts of the countiy, and are subjected to the following rigorous treatment. For forty days they are kept in strict confinement and fed on bread and vinegai\", administered once every twenty- four hours. Each day they are brought to sit for a certain length of time on the tomb of St Naum, while the priest reads a portion of the gospel to them. The monka assert that this treatment never fails.
