Daniela Salvemini, Ph.D., FASPET William Beaumont Professor and Chair, Department of Pharmacology and Physiology Professor, Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Neuroscience Director, Institute for Translational Neuroscience, Saint Louis University School of Medicine Fellow, Saint Louis Academy of Science Fellow, National Academy of Inventors Research Interests: Over 30 million people in the U.S. alone suffer from chronic neuropathic pain. Treatment for these patients is very difficult and current medications are limited by severe side effects and poor efficacy. Novel non-narcotic analgesics are needed. My lab uses state-of-the-art multidisciplinary approaches to unravel molecular pathways through which injury produces changes in the peripheral nerves and the central nervous system that lead to the transition of acute to chronic pain. We are also interested in understanding how opioids such as morphine, cause increase pain sensitivity (a phenomenon known as opioid-induced hyperalgesia) and analgesic tolerance (which refers to a loss of opioid efficacy) known to limit opioid's efficacy and contributing to over-prescription and abuse. Our overarching goal is to identify novel non-opioid based targets for therapeutic intervention for the treatment of neuropathic pain ultimately impacting the lives of patients afflicted with this debilitating disease. This translational approach has led to the identification of several targets, some of which are in clinical development and others in clinical trials. Willis K. Samson, Ph.D., D.Sc. Professor and Vice Chairman of the Department of Pharmacology and Physiology Director of School of Medicine Biomedical Sciences Graduate Programs [willis.samson@health.slu.edu](mailto:willis.samson@health.slu.edu) 314-977-8677 Doisy Hall, R423 Research Interests: Central Control of Metabolism, Reproduction and Cardiovascular Function., G Protein-Coupled Receptors, Pituitary Function, Ingestive Behavior Michael Ariel, Ph.D. Professor, Saint Louis University School of Medicine, Professor, Department of Pharmacology and Physiology Professor, Center for Anatomical Science and Education [michael.ariel@health.slu.edu](mailto:michael.ariel@health.slu.edu) Schwitalla Hall, M335A 314-977-8050 Research Interests: My lab studies sensory information processing using a unique in vitro preparation of an intact brain. That brain tissue is removed from a pond turtle that is extremely resistant to the damaging effects of anoxia. Natural stimulation is presented to attached sense organs (the retina in the eye, the cochlear of the inner ear and the ampullae of labyrinthine semicircular canals in the temporal bone) while recording electrophysiological responses from brainstem neurons. The sensory responses are also measured in physiological media that lacks oxygen to evaluate the brain's ability to encode environmental cues during a turtle's wintering under the surface of a frozen pond in its prolonged cold season. These experiments reveal mechanisms of brain processing and the extent to which such processing is diminished during anoxia each winter. Christopher Arnatt, Ph.D. Assistant Professor Department of Chemistry Assistant Professor of Pharmacology and Physiology [chris.arnatt@slu.edu](mailto:chris.arnatt@slu.edu) Monsanto Hall, 112 Research Interests: The core theme of Dr. Arnatt's research revolves around using organic chemistry to decipher cellular processes and disease states. He has illustrated that by using bioorganic techniques, modern synthetic organic chemistry can be applied to make small molecules that are targeted toward any specific process or protein, which can significantly impact their study. Specifically, he is developing novel small-molecule chemical probes and fluorescent probes to help study biological systems. His research for the next five years will focus on nuclear proteins and DNA modifications as they pertain to cancer and stem cell biology. Andrew A. Butler, Ph.D. Professor [andrew.butler@health.slu.edu](mailto:andrew.butler@health.slu.edu) 314-977-6425 Schwitalla Hall, M325A Research Interests: My research interests are in the general area of the integrative physiology of obesity and diabetes. I have published original research articles on the role of melanocortin receptors expressed in the nervous system. The \"central nervous melanocortin system\" is the canonical neural circuit that integrates signals of energy balance secreted from adipose tissues, the GI tract and pancreas to govern appetite and metabolism. My research has contributed to our knowledge of two melanocortin receptors expressed in the nervous system, one of which (MC4R) is a target for developing drugs against obesity., My current research focuses on a novel \"micropeptide\" involved in the control of liver metabolism and healthy aging of the nervous system. Proteogenomics has identified over a thousand small open reading frames (sORF) encoding proteins less than 100 amino acids in size. We identified a micropeptide named adropin. Our research focuses on the role of the micropeptide in regulating glucose and fatty acid metabolism in the liver and skeletal muscle. We are also investigating whether this micropeptide is a potential lead for developing treatments for cognitive impairment associated with aging and metabolic disease. Anutosh Chakraborty, Ph.D. Associate Professor [anutosh.chakraborty@health.slu.edu](mailto:anutosh.chakraborty@health.slu.edu) 314-977-6480 Schwitalla Hall, M467A The prevalence of obesity has increased globally and in the US. Obesity and type-2 diabetes also greatly increase the risk of various other diseases, such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease/steatohepatitis (NAFLD/NASH), osteoporosis, atherosclerosis, neurodegeneration, and cancer. Pathways that reduce body fat and insulin resistance are being targeted to treat these diseases. The long-term goal of my lab is to define the mechanisms of these processes for rational drug development. A related goal is to identify and validate novel targets in these diseases. We discovered the inositol pyrophosphate biosynthetic enzyme IP6K1 as a novel target and type-2 diabetes. Thus, pharmacologic inhibition of IP6K1 should improve human health by boosting metabolism. The ongoing research is to determine cell- and tissue-specific mechanisms by which IP6K1 causes metabolic diseases and to develop IP6K1 inhibitors to treat these diseases. Moreover, we identified several other novel proteins such the E3 ubiquitin ligase Ube4A that regulate obesity, insulin resistance and NAFLD. Studies are ongoing to 1) determine cell-specific role of Ube4A in metabolic diseases; 2) identifying targets and regulators of Ube4A and deciphering their role in these diseases and 3) development of Ube4A activator compounds for the treatment of obesity and NAFLD/NASH. C. Chrivia, Ph.D. Professor [john.chrivia@health.slu.edu](mailto:john.chrivia@health.slu.edu) 314-977-6486 Doisy Hall, R420 Research Interests: The overall research interest of my laboratory is to understand mechanisms regulating transcription of genes. In particular, we are interested in understanding the role that chromatin structure plays in this process. Using biochemical and molecular biology approaches, we are examining the ability of the SRCAP chromatin remodeling complex to regulate gene expression. One conclusion of our recent studies is that the SRCAP complex regulates transcription, in part by depositing the histone variant H2A.Z into nucleosomes and, in part, through an unknown activity. On going studies suggest this activity may be due to the ability of SRCAP to recruit the transcription elongation factor pTEFb to promoters. A second interest of the laboratory is to determine if targeted disruption of SRCAP function can be used to control growth of some tumor cells. Vincenza Cifarelli, Ph.D. Assistant Professor [vincenza.cifarelli@health.slu.edu](mailto:vincenza.cifarelli@health.slu.edu) Interests: The contribution of endothelial dysfunction in the development of the immuno-metabolic abnormalities associated with obesity and metabolic syndrome. Her interdisciplinary research program investigates how blood and lymphatic vasculature regulate the gut-adipose tissue axis. Her studies aim to provide a plausible original therapeutic strategy for treating obesity by targeting the intestinal vascular and lymphatic endothelium, which recent studies indicate to be an important regulator of body fat distribution, visceral fat deposition and inflammation during diet-induced obesity. Ian de Vera, Ph.D. Assistant Professor [ian.devera@health.slu.edu](mailto:ian.devera@health.slu.edu) 314-977-6400 Schwitalla Hall, M471 Research Interests: Our lab focuses on drug discovery targeting orphan nuclear receptors. Using a combination of high-throughput biophysical screening, LC-MS, NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography, our goal is to find new drugs for various pathological conditions, such as cancer and neurological disorders. Our lab specializes in a diverse arsenal of biophysical techniques to determine the affinity, thermodynamics and kinetics of nuclear receptor-ligand interactions, which will guide the design of drug analogues. These techniques include multidimensional protein scanning fluorimetry and cell-based techniques. Using a metabolomics approach, we identify possible endogenous ligands that bind orphan nuclear receptors, and subsequently map their binding site and characterize the dynamics of the interaction using structural elucidation techniques, such as X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy. We also perform in silico molecular docking of ligand libraries to determine which drug-like molecular scaffolds fit into the pocket, which could corroborate the positive hits identified in the high-throughput biophysical screening. Timothy Doyle, Ph.D. Associate Research Professor [timothy.doyle@health.slu.edu](mailto:timothy.doyle@health.slu.edu) Doisy Hall, R417 Research Interests: We study the and signaling mechanisms (e.g,. glutamatergic signaling, neuroinflammation and nitro-oxidative stress) common to the development of cognitive impairment, chronic pain of various etiologies and opioid-induced tolerance and hyperalgesia (OIH) to identify and develop potential novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of these largely unmet medical needs. We use a number of molecular, biochemical, proteomic and cellular methods to identify transcriptional and signaling changes within peripheral and central nervous tissues and cell culture models.

We are particularly interested in the ability of purines to initiate and/or modulate the innate immune response in these cells, with particular emphasis on the role of ATP and P2X7 receptor ion channels. We use a range of techniques, including voltage-clamp electrophysiology (to study transmembrane currents), patch-clamp photometry (to quantify changes in intracellular calcium), immunocytochemistry, and methods of molecular biology.

Koyal Garg, Ph.D. Associate Professor of Biomedical Engineering Assistant Professor of Pharmacology and Physiology [koyal.garg@slu.edu](mailto:koyal.garg@slu.edu) Biomedical Engineering, 2005 Research Interests: Our primary objective is to develop innovative strategies for the regeneration and rehabilitation of functional muscle tissue in cases of traumatic injuries, with a specific focus on volumetric muscle loss. To achieve this goal, we are pursuing a regenerative approach that involves the use of multifunctional biomaterials that enhance muscle regeneration and function. These biomaterials are composed of chemically cross-linked extracellular matrix proteins and are processed in various forms such as biosponges, hydrogels, micro-particles, or nano-particles, depending on the specific application. These biomaterials not only provide mechanical support but also deliver growth factors, pharmaceuticals, stem cells, and exosomes to targeted areas, suppress immune responses, and act as a substrate for host cell infiltration and proliferation. Furthermore, we are exploring rehabilitative strategies, including neuromuscular electrical stimulation, to improve muscle mass and strength. Ongoing studies are exploring the combined application of regenerative and rehabilitative strategies to maximize their effectiveness. Check out my [lab Luigi Giancotti, Hall Research Interests: The research interest of our laboratory is to understand mechanisms regulating acute and chronic pain. Opioids such as morphine are the most effective analgesics for treating many forms of chronic pain. Unfortunately, the pain-relieving action of morphine is often diminished following chronic administration requiring increased doses. This complex cycle represents a critical barrier to the quality of life of these patients due to the resulting over-sedation, reduced physical activity, constipation, respiratory depression, high potential for addiction, and other side effects. Other currently used analgesics for the management of chronic neuropathic pain, including tranquillizers, antidepressants, antipsychotics, anticonvulsants are barely effective and have unacceptable side effects. Identification of novel analgesics for the management of chronic pain would represent a breakthrough approach addressing a large unmet medical need. Well-characterized animal models of both acute and chronic neuropathic pain are employed in our studies to address this important clinical need. The broader implications of our findings may open a new frontier in both acute and chronic pain management, thus alleviating the socioeconomic consequences it causes. Ajay K. Jain, M.D., DNB Associate Division Chief, Director, M.D./Ph.D. Program, School of Medicine Associate Professor of Pediatrics, Pharmacology and Physiology Section Head, Pediatric Nutrition Medical Director, Pediatric Liver Transplantation, Division of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, SSM Health Cardinal Glennon Children's Medical Center Saint Louis University Associate Professor of Pharmacology and Physiology [ajay.jain@health.slu.edu](mailto:ajay.jain@health.slu.edu) 314-577-5647 Research Interests: My research interests include pediatric liver diseases and nutrition. Our lab evaluates strategies targeting liver and gut injury noted in short bowel syndrome (SBS), which results from bowel resection or lack of functional gut. Enteral nutrition (EN) cannot sustain nutritional needs, and such patients require intravenous nutrition through a process called Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN). TPN is used worldwide as a common and critical therapy in SBS and its use has grown enormously over the last few decades. Despite being a lifesaver, complications in SBS, include life-threatening and potentially fatal liver and gut injuries. While the etiology of such injury is likely multifactorial, recent evidence, including our results, point to an alteration of gut-derived signaling, due to a lack of EN (luminal contents) as occurs is SBS driving such injury. We hypothesize that in SBS, a lack of EN disrupts the normal enterohepatic circulation of bile acids (BA), resulting in inadequate activation of gut Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR) and a decreased synthesis of Fibroblast Growth Factor 19, which regulates hepatic bile acid (BA) synthesis, lipid and glucose homeostasis. Thus, restoration of FGF19 or enteral gut FXR agonists in SBS would mitigate injury. Our data also suggests that during TPN (lack of EN) there is a decrease in Glucagon-like Peptides (GLPs). While GLP-1 regulates insulin, glucose homeostasis and hepatic steatosis, GLP-2 is a known gut tropic protein. Since GLPs are modulated via the G protein-coupled receptor TGR5 we hypothesize that a lack of TGR5 regulation in SBS drives injury and such can be prevented by dual GLP-1/GLP-2 therapy and by gut TGR5 activation. Additionally, further implicating the role of luminal signaling, we have noted significant alterations in the gut microbial colonies in SBS animals on TPN. Since gut microbes can transform primary BA (FXR ligands) to secondary BA (TGR5 ligands), microbial shifts can modulate FXR-FGF19, TGR5-GLP signals and alter key hepatobiliary receptors, transporters contributing Mark Regulation, Renal Denervation as a Treatment for Hypertension, Stress Responsiveness, Responses to Psychostimulants, Sensory Neuroscience, Pain Modulation Grant Kolar, M.D., Ph.D. Professor Pathology Oxygen Transport, Erythrocyte Biology, All Aspects of Respiratory Physiology, Extreme Environments of Heat, Cold, and High Altitude, Sepsis, Septic Shock, Acute Lung Injury, Immuno-Pathophysiology of Multiple Organ Failure, Cytokine Biology, Host Defense Functions of the Lung Heather Macarthur, Ph.D. Professor Department Liaison to the Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion [heather.macarthur@health.slu.edu ](mailto:heather.macarthur@health.slu.edu) 314-977-6456 Schwitalla Hall, M328 Research Interests: Vascular Control and Dysfunction in Hypertension and other Disease States.

We incorporate several computations such as molecular modeling and docking techniques, virtual screening, data analysis and physical property descriptors to design new compounds as potential bioactive molecules. We then employ modern state-of-the-art organic synthesis techniques to synthesize these new molecules and test them with our biology collaborators. This is often an iterative process with this design-synthesize-test cycle being repeated several times to arrive at molecules with the desired profile for a given target. We also synthesize tool compounds and probes that can be used by biologists to study various pathways and mechanisms. The overarching theme of research in the Walker Lab is the design and synthesis of new bioactive molecules to address important biology questions.
