Our Psychiatry Residency Program offers an innovative and exciting didactic and clinical/experiential base for training. Faculty and residents work together, balancing clinical service and education. We have a patient base that is diverse in every way: ethnoculturally, socioeconomically, and by clinical service (private, public sector, community, etc.). This variety ensures that our residents will be able to practice psychiatry anywhere with anyone. Our Mission: HEAR Diverse Training Sites Our residents encounter a wide variety of patient populations and systems of psychiatric care. Our affiliate institutions: [Parkland Health & Hospital System](http://www.parklandhospital.com/), one of the nation's premier public county hospitals [William P. Clements Jr. University Hospital](http://www.utswmedicine.org/hospitals-clinics/zale-lipshy/), a UT Southwestern hospital [Dallas Veterans Affairs Medical Center](http://www.northtexas.va.gov/index.asp), one of the VA's academic flagship centers [Children's Health Dallas](http://www.childrens.com/), a private tertiary care pediatric hospital [Metrocare Services](http://www.metrocareservices.org/), an innovative public-private community psychiatry system - University of Texas Arlington and University of North Texas Student Mental Health We involve every resident in each setting in a coherent plan that balances patient care and education. Diversity of settings allows residents to care for the widest possible range of patients by diagnosis, ethnic background, socioeconomic status, and location. Residents must be eligible to rotate at each of our clinical training sites. Most sites require proof of COVID-19 vaccination, and some sites do not allow for exemptions to this requirement. [Psychiatry Residency Program Structure](https://www.utsouthwestern.edu/education/medical-school/departments/psychiatry/education-and-training/residency-program/postgraduate-years/) We follow the requirements of the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education ( [ACGME](https://www.acgme.org/specialties/psychiatry/overview/)) and provide rotations through different centers of care across the four postgraduate years (PGY) designed to: - establish identity and competence as a physician and ability to manage medical emergencies, primary care, and fundamentals of psychiatric assessment and treatment ( [PGY1](https://www.utsouthwestern.edu/education/medical-school/departments/psychiatry/education-and-training/residency-program/postgraduate-years/pgy1.html)) - consolidate identity and competence as a psychiatrist and ability to diagnose and manage acute presentations of all major areas of psychopathology in ethnically and socioeconomically diverse patients ( [PGY2](https://www.utsouthwestern.edu/education/medical-school/departments/psychiatry/education-and-training/residency-program/postgraduate-years/pgy2.html)) - deepen understanding of diagnosis and formulation and develop competence in long-term management of psychiatric illness ( [PGY3](https://www.utsouthwestern.edu/education/medical-school/departments/psychiatry/education-and-training/residency-program/postgraduate-years/pgy3.html)) - consolidate skills, pursue specific interests and passions, and begin to develop specific expertise ( [PGY4](https://www.utsouthwestern.edu/education/medical-school/departments/psychiatry/education-and-training/residency-program/postgraduate-years/pgy4.html)) We constantly look for ways to support our residents because we believe patient care is best provided by psychiatrists who have balanced and satisfying lives. Our vigorous [Psychiatry Residents Organization](https://www.utsouthwestern.edu/education/medical-school/departments/psychiatry/education-and-training/residency-program/life/psychiatric-residents-organization.html) runs many activities: \"Families\" program, social activities, weekly lunch meeting, yearly retreat day, regular movie nights. Our residents are leaders in initiating support programs for underrepresented minority residents, Muslim residents, and LGBT residents through the HEAL program ( [Housestaff Emerging Academy of Leaders](https://www.utsouthwestern.edu/about-us/administrative-offices/faculty-diversity/students-trainees/heal/)). T-Group, an unstructured Training Group that emphasizes mutual support, problem solving, and experiential learning about small group processes, is an important source of peer support led by experienced group therapists. Our residents have access to the UT Southwestern Resident Wellness and Counseling Center and low-fee psychodynamic psychotherapy at the Dallas Psychoanalytic Center. [Psychiatry Residency Committees and Task Forces](https://www.utsouthwestern.edu/education/medical-school/departments/psychiatry/education-and-training/residency-program/life/task-forces.html) With our [Internal Medicine-Psychiatry Combined Residency Program](https://www.utsouthwestern.edu/education/medical-school/departments/internal-medicine/education-training/im-psychiatry-residency/), residents have an unparalleled opportunity to create and grow the culture of combined practice at our premier academic medical center! We offer a 5-year combined residency program with 30 months each of internal medicine and psychiatry. The UT Southwestern [Neurology-Psychiatry Combined Residency Program](https://www.utsouthwestern.edu/education/medical-school/departments/psychiatry/education-and-training/neuro-psych-residency/) is an ACGME-accredited, 6-year combined residency training program conferring board eligibility in both neurology and psychiatry upon completion of the program. The UT Southwestern [Triple Board Program](https://www.utsouthwestern.edu/education/medical-school/departments/psychiatry/education-and-training/triple-board.html) trains diverse physician leaders and prepares them to treat and advocate for the most complex child and adolescent patients with co-occurring and intertwined physical and mental health problems. Graduates are board-eligible in Pediatrics, Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, and General Adult Psychiatry and are prepared to practice in any one of them. We also have three Psychiatry Residency Tracks that allow applicants to match at the same time into both General (Adult) Psychiatry training and the special area of focus. The [Child and Adult Psychiatry Combined Track](https://www.utsouthwestern.edu/education/medical-school/departments/psychiatry/education-and-training/residency-program/child-track.html) allows applicants to match at the same time into both Adult and Child/Adolescent Psychiatry. The [Research Track](https://swlxwsvauthprd1edu.swmed.edu/education/medical-school/departments/psychiatry/education-and-training/residency-program/postgraduate-years/tracks.html) prepares residents for a future as a principal investigator in translational research. The [Rural and Public Mental Health Track](https://www.utsouthwestern.edu/education/medical-school/departments/psychiatry/education-and-training/residency-program/rpmh-track.html) includes special seminars at Metrocare Services Center for Education and Research and progression of public psychiatry clinical experiences that prepare the resident to become a future leader in public mental health. Additionally, many of our general psychiatry residents use their elective time in postgraduate years 3 and 4 to participate and achieve distinction in one of our seven established [Areas of Concentration](https://www.utsouthwestern.edu/education/medical-school/departments/psychiatry/education-and-training/residency-program/postgraduate-years/concentrations.html): Educator; Global and Cultural Psychiatry; Interventional Psychiatry; Mental Health, Policy, and Law; Psychotherapy; Transitional Age Youth; Women's Mental Health. Our patients cannot flourish if they are not part of a supportive community. Therefore, advocacy for our patients is an important part of our identity. We are committed to training psychiatrists who are expert in the brain, mind, and social systems; are highly capable at working in teams and care systems; meet each patient with dignity and the desire to listen; and feel supported by our training community and in turn support each other. We believe this training can only happen in a community that is dedicated to diversity and inclusion and that pursues social justice and health care equity through vigorous anti-racism efforts.
