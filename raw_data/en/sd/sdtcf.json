Both Healing and Counselling/Coaching is helpfull for those seeking personal and/or Spiritual development. My healing room is at present in Hastings Hawkes Bay, but I do offer Phone Counselling Countrywide as needed. The form of Counselling I offer is called Progressive Counselling which is about healing the past in order to be in the present and move forward in life through blocks/challenges. Natural Spiritual Healing works well alongside Counselling because so often relaxation and stress management is needed also. See website for full description at www.healingtherapies.co.nz.

It is a state rather than a creed. \" (unknown) | WHAT IS NATURAL SPIRITUAL HEALING? | - Natural Spiritual Healing is an ancient Divine science, an intuitive art of balance which utilizes Universal Healing Energy. This energy is directed by the trained attuned Healer into your body's natural healing mechanism to find balance in MIND BODY and SPIRIT. - Natural Spiritual Healing is a complimentary therapy. I work alongside doctors' recommendations, diagnoses and medication. Healings also work well alongside other therapies or bodywork but is a complete therapy in it's own right. WHAT CAN I EXPECT IN A HEALING SESSION? - All Healings begin with a thorough consultation in which we discuss how you would like the Healing to help you. I also answer any questions you may have about the Healing. If needed we look into how you can empower yourself in Healing in your life through suggestions and tools which may be helpful to you. - After the consultation you lie fully clothed on the healing table (if you are able otherwise a chair healing is possible) covered in a cozy blanket. You will then receive exactly what you need from the healing. - Most people experience Healings as being very relaxing and find the benefits far reaching. DO YOU HAVE TO HAVE A FAITH TO RECEIVE HEALINGS? - No. Anyone with any faith or non beliefs benefit from Healings. It helps to believe in the Healing but it isn't necessary. HOW CAN HEALINGS HELP? - When we are balanced we feel, heal and cope in the best possible way. - Research suggests that 85% + of what people go to the doctor for has an emotional or stress related component. Healings bring healing into the root cause of dis-ease or challenges, reduce stress by helping to bring you back into balance and consequently you feel more relaxed. - Healings can be a great preventative measure against stress, injury or illness. The aim is maintaining balance and vitality. Healings top up your energy levels. - Healings purify your energy field helping to clear negative or heavy energy. - Healings strengthen your higher self relationship opening up what is meant to be possible for you and in your life. - Healings are holistic there is no limit to how you can be helped. WHO BENEFITS FROM HEALINGS? - Everyone and anyone! Babies, children, teenagers, adults of all ages and those ready to pass on (transitions, stress, challenges, illness, shock, injury, grief whether major or minor can affect anyone). EXAMPLES OF WHY PEOPLE COME FOR HEALINGS. - Because they want to treat themselves to a mind, body and spirit pamper! - Because they feel something isn't quite right or want more out of life. - For support during stress, shock, change or transitions .....puberty, relationship issues, pregnancy, marriage, menopause, shifting, job change or loss, death, aging and dying. - For help with hormones, skin conditions, menstrual or gynaecological difficulties, pregnancy, infertility, candida, chronic fatigue, asthma, digestive disorders, arthritis, problems with muscles, broken bones, tendons or the skeletal system, cardiac disorders, cancers and more...nothing is too big or small all can be helped. - To help reduce potential complications prior to surgery and to help speed up recovery. - For help with addictions, depression and other mental problems. HOW OFTEN WILL I NEED HEALINGS? - This depends on the individual need. Usually people will have an initial appointment and we (you and I) intuitively make the next. For some that will be weekly for a time, for others they may only need 4-6 weekly 'maintenance' healings to keep everything flowing nicely. Other clients choose to ring me as they feel they need an appointment. "}
