Health problems related to a needs assessment includes baseline data collected from research journal articles and other health related agencies. The health pandemic is prioritized by identifying target populations in the United States who have been affected by autoimmune diseases, vaccine damage, and high levels of inflammation [1-5].

Autoimmune disease is a health pandemic affecting many individuals in the United States [4,6]. Major obstacles related to the health problem include: 1. diagnosis is difficult, 2. understanding about the health problem by allopathic doctors is limited, and 3. understanding how to heal the health problem is difficult when practitioners do not have the knowledge or training necessary to address the problem [6]. Symptoms related to autoimmune disease intersect many specialties and can affect every organ in the human body. Allopathic medical training offers minimal education regarding the health pandemic [6]. Allopathic medical training offers minimal education regarding the health pandemic (AARDA, 2020). In addition, practitioners trained in the allopathic business model are unaware of treatment advances that are not known throughout various specialty areas [6]. Typically, beginning symptoms can be unspecific and intermittent before the disease advances to an acute stage [4,6]. Additional challenges such as a limited amount of research conducted on the topic is typically limited in scope and disease-specific [4,6]. This challenge adds to the misinformed and uneducated nature of allopathic practitioners [6]. Furthermore, an increased crossover between research projects and information sharing regarding various autoimmune diseases is necessary [6]. Adapted from DrJockers.com (n.d.). The 7 major factors causing autoimmune conditions. https://drjockers.com/7-factors-causingautoimmune- conditions/ Autoimmune disease is a significant health pandemic and spans throughout many races, cultures, and groups within in the United States (NIAID, 2017). Clustering of the disease can be found in families and groups of individuals with close relationships and similar lifestyle choices and dietary habits [4]. Knowledgeable and educated health practitioners are needed who understand how to balance immune system activity and who can address the health pandemic. More research is needed in this area to educate health practitioners and the public regarding how to heal the body and raise immunity through integrative, holistic, and functional medicine practices such as Chelation and IV nutrient therapies to remove heavy metals as well as targeted diet and nutrition remedies [8]. Health discoveries in these areas and practices have made autoimmune research an encouraging area for new discovery [4]. According to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID), the debilitating and chronic complexity of these vast array of diseases result in a diminished quality of life and rising medical costs causing burdens on patients, families, and communities. Reports indicate that more than 80 diseases develop because of the body's immune system assaulting its own tissues, organs, and cells [4]. Frequent autoimmune diseases consist of systemic lupus erythematosus, type 1 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, and rheumatoid arthritis [1-5]. Other autoimmune diseases are more difficult to diagnose [9]. Many autoimmune diseases are caused by toxic environmental exposures and infections [4]. Additionally, herbicides such as Monsanto's Glyphosate in the food supply, high levels of heavy metals in the body, and poor diet lacking nutritional benefits to raise immunity and balance Ph are other variables negatively affecting individuals dealing with autoimmune diseases [8]. Patients commonly suffer years before being diagnosed with an autoimmune disease and allopathic providers do not know how to cure or heal these diseases[9]. Commonly, allopathic practitioners prescribe lifelong pharmaceutical treatments only in an effort to manage some symptoms. In the United States, autoimmune diseases collectively affect more than 24 million individuals and an additional eight million with auto-antibodies blood molecules indicating a high prediction for developing autoimmune disease [9]. According to beliefs held in the allopathic business model, autoimmune diseases are affecting more individuals for unknown reasons [9]. Moreover, the causes of these diseases continue to be a mystery to allopathic providers [9]. According to the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (2020), autoimmune diseases tend to be more common when the following environmental exposures are present: Agricultural chemicals and pesticides, Mercury exposure, Environmental pollutants, and A multitude of diet and nutrition problems leading to a lack of important vitamins and nutrients such as Vitamin D and many others [9]. Dietary micronutrients have been found to improve the health of patients with autoimmune diseases [9]. Since most allopathic providers have not been properly educated and trained regarding autoimmune diseases, inflammation [4], and diet and nutritional medicine, also called functional medicine, practitioners in the allopathic business model do not have the tools, knowledge, or the certification to address these problems. Chelation and IV nutrient therapies require homeopathic and naturopathy certification to legally administer and practice. Most allopathic providers are lacking the board certified credentials and medical training in this area of medicine. In addition, allopathic providers believe there are no cures [4] and commonly prescribe unnecessary pharmaceutical drugs that cause many additional harmful side effects. Allopathic practitioners have not been trained [4] or certified to understand what causes autoimmune diseases or how to heal the pandemic facing a vast number of Americans. Treatments are available for many autoimmune diseases that do not involve harmful, toxic pharmaceutical drugs or unnecessary surgery. Healing can be found through integrative, holistic, functional medical practitioners who are knowledgeable, educated, and certified to address and heal autoimmune diseases. Health practitioners conduct a needs assessment to aid in identifying gaps in services and resources in areas where groups and individuals in a community might be at a greater risk for poor health outcomes and health disparities. Data related to health behaviors and outcomes, access to health services, socioeconomic status, and demographics can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the assets and needs of communities [10-11]. Public health policymakers and change agents can use a needs assessment tool to determine developing health challenges, to identify hard-to-reach or hidden populations, and to identify where individuals are not obtaining services to address health needs [10- 11]. As a foundation, health practitioners can use the strengths of a community to aid in improving health for target populations. An example of how healthcare practitioners can use a needs assessment could involve addressing the pandemic of autoimmune diseases in the United States.

Gluten intolerance is really GLYPHOSATE POISONING. https://redoubtnews.com/2017/07/gluten-monsantoglyphosate- poisoning/ A needs assessment can involve the use of intervention mapping to aid in identifying health challenges and disparities within a community or target population. Intervention mapping involves the following key steps: Conducting a problem analysis or needs assessment. Identifying what needs to be changed. Determining who needs intervention. Creating change matrices with targets linking: Secondary behaviors and performance targets with behavioral determinants, and Determining beliefs that need to be addressed by a behavioral mediation. Choosing intervention methods based on theory with matching behavioral determinants. Targeting beliefs that have been identified. Translating into practical applications that help target populations and individuals make positive behavioral health changes. Incorporating methods and practical applications into a coordinated health intervention program. Preparing for choosing, implementing, and sustaining a health intervention initiative in real-life situations. Developing assessment methods to conduct process and effect assessments [10-11]. Adapted from Mcleod, B. (n.d.). Introduction to intervention mapping - PowerPoint PPT presentation. https://www.slideserve. com/benedict/introduction-to-intervention-mapping. The key to lasting healing is knowing the right information and the right healers, doctors, and scientific researchers. Wisdom is life changing and saves lives. In addition, turning off the fear-based Big corporate media and learning about how one can take personal action in his or her life to create a lifestyle of healing and change rather than a lifestyle of weakness, dependency thinking, fear, and misinformation is critical to health and wellbeing.

Program Objectives & Goals Health educators and shareholders can design program interventions that benefit changes in health behavior, health literacy, and overall health and wellbeing of patients with autoimmune disease. A comprehensive health education and promotion program for autoimmune patients can involve the following components: Interpreting and analyzing multiple and comprehensive collected health data concerning interests and needs in cultural and social environments. Differentiating behaviors that hinder and foster wellbeing. Determining essential requirements needed for a health education intervention based upon data obtained. Gathering, analyzing, describing, and reporting information regarding disease, health, and delivery of healthcare services. Selecting and recruiting shareholders. Constructing logical sequence and scope plan. Formulating measurable objectives. Executing the plan. Selecting media and methods appropriate for the plan. Analyzing and revising the plan as needed. Selecting and using counseling techniques and adjusting for individualized needs of patients. Assessing program achievements and objectives. Interpreting results. Inferring implications for future program planning [9,10,17-18]. The role of affective and learning experiences is critical in health education, promotion, and behavioral change [10,17-18]. Self-evaluation and self-motivation is integral in strengthening experiential learning opportunities [10,17-18] The trust and confidentiality of patients suffering from autoimmune disorders can be established by health educators and shareholders maintaining a scrupulous do no harm code of ethics that notoriously and consistently has been lacking in the allopathic and pharmaceutical business model. Before starting any intervention, the integrative medical team of health practitioners involved in the healing process must conduct a full medical evaluation for each patient, which includes obtaining full medical records, blood work, and interviewing the patient in detail. The interviews must involve questions pertaining to what the patient puts on the body, in the body, and what the patient is surrounded by in his or her daily environment to assess diet, physical activity, toxins in the environment, and deficiencies that may need to be addressed in the intervention. Once a full medical assessment has been conducted, the integrative medical team of health practitioners can develop an individualized intervention plan based upon the patient's needs and deficiencies that must be addressed. Various symptoms exhibited by patients with autoimmune disease can include, but are not limited to, irritability and stress, chronic pain, menstrual disorders, headaches, digestive issues, and chronic disease. Essential elements of healing autoimmune disease can include colon hydrotherapy to: eliminate chronic constipation; aid the body to facilitate waste elimination; aid the body to increase energy; aid the body to detoxify; and aid the body to reduce cravings for sugar addiction and other unhealthy processed food cravings (Fontes & Stawicki, n.d.) [19]. Colon hydrotherapy can aid with the following symptoms: frequent illness, pain in joints, low-back pain, gas, bad breath, body odor, chronic fatigue, bags under the eyes, inability to sleep, depression, brain fog, thyroid disruption, diabetes, migraines, stress, hormonal imbalance, constipation, and weight gain (Fontes & Stawicki, n.d.)[19]. A colon that is unhealthy strains the kidneys and overloads liver function (Fontes & Stawicki, n.d.)[19].Toxicity builds up and creates additional health challenges (Fontes & Stawicki, n.d.)[19].A colonic protocol is a safe and effective way to eliminate waste and toxins from the body without harmful pharmaceutical drugs (Fontes & Stawicki, n.d.)[19].In addition, unblocking Qi-energy flow in the body by facilitating detoxification with acupuncture aids the body in healing (Fontes & Stawicki, n.d.)[19].In addition, unblocking Qi-energy flow in the body by facilitating detoxification with acupuncture aids the body in healing (Fontes & Stawicki, n.d.)[19]. Adapted from Fontes, M., & Stawicki, M. (n.d.) [19]. Natural medicine and detox. https://naturalmedicineanddetox.com/ Remedies to aid in detoxification and raising the body's immunity can include intravenous (IV) therapies such as: Vitamin C IV therapy heals and promotes immunity; Ultraviolet blood irradiation cleans blood of bacteria, fungus, and virus; Ozone therapy heals and promotes immunity; Myers' cocktail IV therapy provides the body with essential vitamins and minerals; Hydrogen peroxide IV therapy cleans the body of bacteria, fungus, and virus; Chelation IV therapy removes heavy metals [20-22]; B-12 injections heal and promote immunity; and Nutritional IV's provides the body with essential vitamins and minerals lacking in diet (Fontes & Stawicki, n.d.) [19]. Common metal poisoning can include mercury, lead, cadmium, and arsenic. Toxic heavy metals can be absorbed by the body through: environmental factors, industrial exposure, water pollution, pharmaceuticals and allopathic medicines, X-ray machines, and plastic food containers, pots, and pans improperly coated with toxic manufactured materials [20,21,23-24]. General symptoms of heavy metal poisoning can include, but are not limited to, the following: full body or some parts of the body in chronic pain, joint pain, dizziness or vertigo, exhaustion, feeling tired all the time, low energy, shortness of breath, tingling in hands and feet, nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, chills, weakness, and vomiting [20-24]. Mercury poisoning symptoms can include: trouble walking, vision changes, nerve damage in feet and hands, speech and hearing difficulties, weakness in muscles, and lack of coordination [20-24]. Lead poisoning symptoms can include: loss of developmental skills in children, memory loss, fatigue, headaches, anemia, loss of appetite, high blood pressure, irritability, sleep problems, aggressive behavior, and constipation [20-24]. Arsenic poisoning symptoms can include: muscle cramps, unusual heart rhythm, spots on skis such as lesions and warts, swollen or red skin, and diarrhea, vomiting, or nausea [20-24]. Cadmium poisoning symptoms can include: muscle pain, breathing problems, and fever [20-24]. Chelation therapy is an extremely effective therapeutic for removing heavy metals from the body, aiding in the repair of arteries damaged by chemicals in the bloodstream, and removing excess calcium [20]. Chelation is best known for treating heavy metal poisoning, although it can also be used as a treatment for circulatory disorders and heart disease [20]. Furthermore, chelation therapy enhances the body's ability to flow blood more efficiently and easily [20]. Chelation has afforded patients a successful and effective manner to heal heart disease rather than invasive harmful heart surgery [20]. Furthermore, chelation can be used as a treatment to avoid limb amputation for diabetics, reduce high blood pressure, and alleviate angina [20]. Chelation therapy can benefit the following conditions: Peripheral vascular disease, Intermittent claudication, Diabetic complications, Peripheral neuropathy, Hypertension, Cerebrovascular disease, Slow healing wounds, Memory disorders, Detoxification therapies for heavy metals, and Cardiovascular disease [20]. With an impeccable record of safety, and over the last 50 years, many suffering individuals chose chelation for a broad spectrum of circulatory health challenges [20]. \"A review of 40 published and 30 unpublished studies involving over 25,000 patients who underwent EDTA chelation demonstrated that 87 percent benefited from this therapy [20]. Other ways to kill pathogens in the body include ultra violet blood irradiation therapy and ozone therapy, which involve therapies that add oxygen and ozone to the blood and passing the blood through an ultra violet light to kill viruses, parasites, fungus, and bacteria. These therapies aid in healing many chronic autoimmune diseases and autism. Find a holistic clinic, naturopathy doctor, or integrative doctor in your area and ask about these life-changing therapies. \"Major Autohemotherapy (or MAH) is a type of IV therapy in which your blood is first withdrawn from your vein into an IV bag, and then mixed with medical ozone. After your blood and ozone are mixed together in the bag, the mixture will be dripped back into your vein. As a result, no Ozone actually enters your bloodstream. Rather the biological byproduct of the external mixing of your blood with ozone (ozinides, etc.) are actually creating the healing effect\" (Tringali-Health.com (2020) [25]. Ozone improves mitochondrial function and efficiency. Ozone makes red blood cells more elastic and flexible. Ozone kills bacteria, fungi, mold, and viruses. Ozone stimulates the production of Tumor necrosis Factor. Ozone stimulates increased levels of Interferon levels. Ozone stimulates the production of white blood cells (Tringali-Health.com (2020)[25]. MAH can be used as a therapy for the following health problems: Tinnitus (vascular only) Acute hearing loss (vascular only) Low Immunity Infections (viral, bacterial, fungal) Eye Diseases especially retinopathies (shingles) Herpes simplex and herpes zoster Hepatitis B and C Asthma and COPD Diabetic Circulatory Disease Post Stroke Dementia and Cerebral Vascular Disease Peripheral Artery Disease Heart and Vascular Disease Auto Immune Disease Osteo and Rheumatoid Arthritis LYME Disease Chronic Allergies Chemical Sensitivities Fibromyalgia Chronic Fatigue and CF Autism (Tringali-Health.com (2020) [25]. Five essential elements for successful detox include the following: drainage, elimination, nutrition, inflammation, and detoxification (Fontes & Stawicki, n.d.)[19]. Healing the body's microbiome is essential because 60% of the body's immunity is in the intestinal track. Healing a leaky gut related to pesticides and Glyphosate poisoning in the food supply is essential to a healthy microbiome. Knowledgeable integrative healthcare practitioners can educate patients and explain how this type of healing is accomplished. Furthermore, addressing diet, nutrition, and essential vitamins and minerals lacking in the patient's profile must be targeted factors in an individualized intervention plan to heal autoimmune disease (Figure 10). Adapted from Five Seasons Functional Medicine. (2019) [26]. What is intestinal permeability (leaky gut)? https:// fiveseasonsmedical.com/leaky-gut/Key areas that must be included in a personalized intervention plan involve aiding the body's elimination processes by detoxing heavy metals, waste, toxins, and pesticides with targeted and integrative therapies. Moreover, the integrative medical team will address building the body's immunity based upon what essential vitamins and minerals are lacking from the patient's diet by prescribing a specific nutrition regime, herbs, plants, roots, fruits, nuts, and spices with targeted individualized integrative therapeutics. A focus on education regarding probiotic foods is necessary as well. Food has the power to cure or kill. Food is medicine and can be used to build a better immune system. An integrative medical team can aid autoimmune patients in removing toxins from the body, reducing unhealthy cravings, building the body's immunity, and educating about diet and nutrition. Adapted from Fontes, M., & Stawicki, M. (n.d.)[19]. Natural medicine and detox. https://naturalmedicineanddetox.com/ Who should evaluate? When working with autoimmune patients, various evaluators and evaluations are required. For example, participatory evaluation can involve various shareholders and activities. Primary responsibilities involve evaluation of professionalism, ethics, leadership, management, communication, advocacy, research, evaluation, implementation, planning, capacity, and needs [27]. Integrative health practitioners, health educators, and auxiliary health providers play specific and varied roles in the participatory evaluation, diagnosis, prescribing, documenting, and follow-up procedures for patients suffering with autoimmune disease. Leaders and shareholders in healthcare seek ways to strategically and continuously advance and refine processes to improve patients' overall satisfaction and experience, reduce costs, and improve patient care [28-30]. Project management competencies in healthcare have become significantly critical from a business perspective in the healthcare sector because these aptitudes aid in controlling costs, managing risk, and improving project outcomes [28-30]. When project management techniques and methodologies are applied in program design, shareholders are better equipped to plan, organize, and execute tasks in a systematic manner to maximize resources and achieve tangible objectives [28-30]. To conduct project management in a successful manner, involving appropriate shareholders contributing in distinctive roles with specific responsibilities can be planned and executed by the following roles and duties: Program manager plans, manages, and executes the program by engaging shareholders. Program sponsor is involved in a senior leadership manner and administrates support and guidance while making essential decisions. Program team involves individuals contributing to the implementation of the program. Program shareholders involve individuals impacted by the program's outcome or those who administer and supply resources and services [28-30]. Adapted from Frieden, T. R. (2010)[31]. A framework for public health action: The health impact pyramid. American Journal of Public Health, 100(4), 590-595. Phase one involves initiating the program. Phase two involves planning the program. Phase three involves executing the program. Phase four involves closing the program. Successful project management involves mindfulness of regulations, processes, privacy, quality, and patient safety [29,30]. When conducting a needs assessment, it is necessary to have clarity regarding what one is evaluating, why one is evaluating, and for whom one is evaluating. These details are critical for shaping an evaluation tool that can be effective. Assessment of program effectiveness can involve three distinct processes, which include: (1) process evaluation, (2) impact evaluation, and (3) outcome evaluation [32-35]. Process evaluation involves the documentation and tacking of the process of a program's implementation [33]. Evaluation of process aids shareholders in observing how impact and outcome of a program was accomplished [18,32-33,35]. The objective of evaluating a process is centered on the quantities and types of: delivered services, recipients receiving services, resources needed in the delivery of services, challenges experienced, and whether challenges were successfully addressed and resolved [33]. Furthermore, process evaluation aids in understanding infrastructure and program management processes to decide whether the program was able to deliver its promised objectives and goals [33]. Impact evaluation involves cause-and-effect analysis using precise methods to examine outcome changes associated with specific interventions used in the program [33,35]. This type of evaluation examines what might have happened without the intervention by designing quasi-experimental or experimental studies involving treatment and comparison groups [33,35]. Impact evaluations serve to provide accountability determining how well and whether the program achieved its mission. Furthermore, impact evaluations aid in answering program design questions related to which approaches, among various that were used, were the most effective. Impact evaluations should be used: to test innovations in program design, pilot programs, when intervention will be replicated and scaled in other settings, when the intervention is untested, and if results of the intervention could influence important policy-making decisions [33,35]. Outcome evaluation is commonly desired by foundations and assesses whether a program was effective in producing change. This type of evaluation queries for different questions and measures what happened to individuals participating in the program and the extent to which participation in the program affected their lives [34]. Outcome evaluations measure program effectiveness in generating change. Process evaluations aid shareholders in understanding how a program's impact and outcome was achieved [34]. Impact and outcome evaluations measure how well and whether objectives of the program were delivered [33-35]. The discussion examined a health pandemic affecting a growing number of individuals in the United States. Health problems related to a needs assessment included baseline data collected from research journal articles and other health related agencies. The health pandemic was prioritized by identifying target populations in the United States who have been affected by autoimmune diseases, vaccine damage, and high levels of inflammation [1-5]. A needs assessment can be administered to target populations via small groups, in-person, in-clinic, or online consultations as well as online curriculum modules. Furthermore, the discussion explained program objectives and goals for a health education and intervention program for autoimmune disease patients. In addition, a comprehensive project management intervention strategy and implementation plan was summarized. How to monitor and evaluate the intervention plan was described. Finally, the role of program evaluators was addressed. Eleven graphics were included throughout the document. "}
