The book was SO GOOD that I read it twice and wrote this \"book report\" post for parents who were interested but not yet committed to reading it (because we have very tight schedules!) These tools help caregivers support their children in navigating difficult experiences using... Alright, you are a new parent, or maybe you are a seasoned parent. Your days are long and your nights (of rest) are short. But the good part is that you can take a few key steps to ensure that when you are awake you have the energy you need to keep up with the little ones. And more importantly for those zzz's you are getting, lets make them count! Your diet is the most foundational, most important, most crucial part of your wellness plan. And for many of you, this may be the furthest thing... Everyone experiences anxiety at some point in their life. It can act as a motivator to help achieve goals, increase awareness of stressful situations, and even help to protect us from potential danger. But when children feel anxious, is it normal? Anxiety can be a normal part of your child's development as they move through the different ages and stages of their life. Some fears are natural, and can help your child protect themselves. For example, if your child were playing in a field, and saw... What is a wart, anyway? You're tickling your child's food and you notice a spot that is not like the others. It's hard, grainy, a bit like a knot of skin and it might have some black or brownish speckles to it. Plantar's warts are found exclusively on the feet and might cause pain while walking, especially when they are large in size. Plantar warts are caused by a type of human papilloma virus (did you know there are more than 100 types of HPV?) that specifically targets the skin of th... I did a bad thing. I Googled. Annika is due for her 12 month appointment in a few days and she's been speaking a couple of words (and rapidly picking up more it seems). I know that's pretty normal, but I wanted to find out how many words other kids are speaking at that age and whether or not she was \"advanced\" for her age. Bad Mom. First of all because I should not be comparing. Secondly because \"advanced\" or \"gifted\" children aren't \"b... If I had a list of FAQ's (I should!), this would be at the top of the list: What kind, and how much milk should my toddler drink? And, the answer I always give is that any milk (other than breast milk) after the age of 12 months should be considered a beverage, and not a primary source of nutrition. It's understandably confusing, given the importance of milk in the Canadian and US Food Guides. But, is milk, as a food group really necessary for health? Many would say \"n... A healthy summertime treat your kids will LOVE! Blueberry lemon popsicles make a cool treat for hot summer days, plus they're full of Vitamin C and antioxidants! To make, combine the following ingredients in your blender: 1 cup blueberries fresh juice from 5 lemons, be sure to strain out the seeds 1/4 cup maple syrup or honey (you can use more or less to taste to adjust the tartness) 3 cups of water Blend thoroughly until the blueberries liquefied. Freeze in popsicle trays or BPA-free pops... Water intake is critical for many body functions, but it's especially important for optimal brain health. It's so important that the human body can't live more than a few days without it. Water makes up to about 60-65% of your child's total weight (up to 75% for infants). That's a lot of water! Children are more likely to become dehydrated than adults because they lose more water through their skin. They also lack awareness of how much fluid they need to consume to stay hydrated. On t... What is Celiac Disease? Celiac disease (also called Celiac Sprue and Gluten-Sensitive Enteropathy) is an autoimmune condition that is triggered by contact with gluten, a protein found in some grains like wheat, rye, and barley. Autoimmune conditions are immune reactions where the body starts to attack its own tissues. In the case of celiac disease, the antibodies that are produced cause damage to the small intestine. The exact cause of celiac disease is not known, but like many things it seems t... Irritable bowel syndrome is a functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorder that affects children and adults. It is estimated that 5-20% of children may develop IBS, with symptoms such as: Tummy pain, Bloating or visible abdominal distension Excessive gas Diarrhea Constipation Many parents are eager to find a dietary solution to IBS, and a low FODMAP diet is worth considering. What are FODMAPs? FODMAP stands for Fermentable Oligosaccharides Disaccharides Monosaccarides and the... What do trampolines, lemons and red clovers have in common? They can all help your kids get rid of chemicals in their bodies. Pound for pound, children are exposed to more toxins than adults are because they eat more, breathe more, and have a greater skin surface area. More toxins get into their bodies and their immature organ systems make them more susceptible to damage (infants are 10x more susceptible and children 3x). Toxins can easily be found in our water, food, air, personal car... What kid doesn't love a squeezey packet. My 5 year old still asks for them. And I have to remind her that those are for little children (she is a big girl after all). When I first saw those as a new mom, I thought, oh wow, how fun. And of course I also thought, oh wow, how wasteful. Sometimes I am my own pain in the you know what. The reality of being me is that anytime I evaluate something I would like to add into my life, I need to know how \"wasteful\" it is and how much damag... Bedroom monsters can be a serious medical condition contributing to fear, insomnia, irritability and fatigue. Bedroom monsters frequently occur in closets, dark corners, under beds and cribs, or behind lamps and dressers. How do you know if your child suffers from bedroom monsters? The symptoms typically present as reluctance to go to bed, frequent night-time wakings, and the child verbalizing the presence of monsters. If left untreated bedroom monsters can pose a serious threat to quality o... As you may have heard, food is our best medicine. When you or your child are ill you definitely want to get the best foodpossible, but what are these mysterious healthy foods to eat while you're sick? Go for foods that are easy to eat but pack a good nutritional punch. It is important to stay hydrated while ill, so make sure the patient gets plenty of liquids such as: water, coconut water, broths, soups, watered down organic juices (I suggest half water/half juice). If you are having a h... A note from your editor: here at Naturopathic Pediatrics we strongly support breastfeeding as the optimal way to nourish infants. When breastfeeding is not possible and donor milk is not available we want to give families accurate information to help them choose the right breastmilk substitute. This article below is a Sponsored Post by Kabrita USA. Ashley Weber, ND shares some commonly asked questions and corrects some misinformation about formula ingredients. This article is intended fo... If you're at all familiar with my practice, you'll know that I'm a huge advocate of baby led weaning (BLW). For the several years I've been offering workshops in addition to counseling patients and families in my office on the ins and out of BLW for the past several years. My interest in BLW was piqued after we my first daughter was born. We had such success with it that we subsequently used it to introduce food to our twins who were born in 2010 When as... From Cheerios to goldfish, it seems the default snack in America today is the refined carbohydrate. Refined carbs quickly turn into sugar in the body, making them a poor choice for satiating hunger, creating balanced energy, or delivering much nutritional value. Furthermore, most refined crackers and breads contain gluten, which is known to irritate the nervous system. In addition to gluten sensitivity, many children nowadays also have trouble with dairy products, which can crease inflammation ... As I discovered this summer, gluten-free dehydrated meals are extremely hard to find and very expensive (unless you want to live on jerky and spongy freeze-dried scrambled eggs). But good food doesn't need to be expensive or unhealthy - here are some of my favorite recipes that I tried out this summer. I bought most of the dehydrated ingredients on Amazon.com, where you can get good deals if you're prepared to buy in bulk. Harmony House Foods now has a backpacking kit fil... Why is it that when I walk into a day care snack time, I see kids eating pretzels, goldfish, crackers, or other variety of simple carb loaded with salt and almost void of nutrition? Why, when kids gain the ability to feed themselves, do we swap their pureed veggies, fruits, meat, and grains, for crunchy, salty, refined white flour products in a plastic bag? Sure, I know that it's easier. But is it even a conscious choice anymore? Or have we all been lulled into forgetting the ... To help you decide whether Elimination Communication is right for your infant or toddler, this post dissects the what, when, and how of elimination communication.... The \"Standard American Diet\" The classic American kids' menu is generally the same at all restaurants: grilled cheese sandwich, chicken nuggets and fries, macaroni and cheese, or pizza, and a juice box. In far fewer restaurants, kids' menus may provide apple slices or carrots. This is now becoming more common even of international cuisine where these typical Americanized \"kid foods\" are showing up on menus simply due to the the demand of what children are eating. Moderation i... Are you struggling with behavioral issues in your child? Have you ever wondered if blood sugar control is affecting them? So often I see a parent come in with a child who needs behavior modification - and the schools of course want something to be done about it. I get it! Schools are over populated, with not nearly enough teachers to students. Their job has become a large mix of behavior management and teaching. What I don't get, is the lack of awareness of how much this behavior modif... As parents, we often spend a lot of time thinking about our parenting decisions, especially when it comes to food choices. As a parent, I know I've worried when one of my children hasn't eaten enough, or only wants toast for days on end. And, as much as I want to feed them healthy food, I also want to raise them to trust their cues and instincts so that they choose foods that are also pleasurable and satisfying. Why? Because learning to really trust their instincts when it comes t... Last week I wrote about Mom blogs and how they make me anxious with their beautiful, picture-perfect families and super-Mom stories. Over this past week I heard from several other parents who have said they identify with my Mom-guilt. This week I am dealing with the fact that I'm not perfect. (I hope that's not what you're looking for when you read my blog, because I can't deliver that. But I can be honest.) I'm not perfect. I don't have the flawl... This is an exciting event in a new parent's life, but it can feel overwhelming and produce anxiety. There are different ways to introduce solid foods, and each method has ardent supporters and vehement detractors. Five different sources may give you five different \"best\" or \"only\" ways to do it. My goal is to provide clear information based on the latest scientific research. Evidence regarding solid food introduction is evolving as new research takes place. Some information you find is... Editors note: A big thanks to Dr. Cori Burke for tackling the incredibly broad topic of nutritional deficiencies in children. This is a huge topic, and she has wisely split it into multiple sections. Stay tuned for more in this series! A quick note and comment: Naturopathic Physicians are sometimes criticized for over-diagnosing \"nutritional deficiencies,\" or for excessively prescribing vitamins and supplements. It is always very important for physicians to have a conve... Could your child have a B vitamin deficiency? This article is the second in a series all about nutritional deficiencies. In these articles I will discuss some of the most common vitamin and mineral deficiencies seen in children and adolescents. I will also explain the lab tests that can be used to comprehensively assess your child's nutritional status. If you missed it, here is Part 1: Vitamin D. First, let's recap why vitamin and mineral deficiencies happen. Common Causes of Nutrient Defici... Update from Dr. Erika: I want parents to understand that this article is not meant to place blame, or to make parents feel guilty in any way for giving their children Tylenol. I also want parents to understand that development of autistic spectrum disorder is a multifactorial process. There is no \"one\" trigger for autism. Rather, it is a combination of genetic and environmental factors that contribute to the development of autism. Tylenol is only one of these factors. ... ele... Mommy blogs make me anxious. Especially the crunchy, granola, happy, hippie, healthy Mama blogs. You know, the ones tagged antivax, homebirthing/waterbirthing, GAPS diet, elimination communication, EBF, baby-wearing, co-sleeping, baby-led weaning or unschooling. The ones with eight or nine beautiful, artsy photographs of their trendy kids frolicking in fields of blissful childhood. What's wrong with me? I'm a naturopathic physician. A naturopath. I love all things natu... According to research by the CDC (Center for Disease Control) \"Childhood obesity has more than doubled in children and quadrupled in adolescents in the past 30 years.\" Findings from 2012 found that 'more than one third of children and adolescents {in the United States} were overweight or obese.\" Issues with excess weight have long-term implications. It has been found that 30% of obese adults first developed weight problems in childhood. Likely Causes of Childhood Obesity: 1. Lack of hea... These yummy paleo banana blueberry muffins are a healthy morning treat for the whole family. They are grain-free, gluten-free, and dairy-free, with just the right amount of sweetness. Even the pickiest of eaters will be sure to enjoy them. Because they are made with almond flour, almond butter, and eggs they also have a good amount of protein. These muffins are a favorite in my house and I hope they will become a favorite in yours too! Makes 15-18 muffins Ingredients: 3 very ripe bananas, peeled... We've recently just overcome the \"picky eater\" stage at our house, and I've also been counseling a number of parents about how to add variety to their child's diet. Here's a typical scenario I hear about: \"My child used to be such a great eater. She'd eat anything and everything we gave her. Now, we rotate between a handful of foods, and often end up making something just for her to ensure that she's eaten something. I feel like a shor... For a lot of my patients, eating breakfast can be a real challenge. Many people say they aren't hungry until later in the day. Others say they don't have time to fit in breakfast on top of getting ready, packing lunches, feeding pets, and getting out the door. Kids - teens especially - are also swept up in the crazy-hectic pace of the morning. Some families can't afford breakfast for their kids, adding an extra challenge. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, approximately 8... The first part of this series talked about WHY EATING BREAKFAST IS SO IMPORTANT FOR KIDS. Eating the most important meal not only improves concentration and academic performance, it reduces the risk of weight gain, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. If you have a child struggling with ADHD you may also want to check out Healing your child from ADHD What to Eat: Ditch the Carbs and go for Protein! In America, we tend to reach for breakfast foods that are high in carbohydrates, such as cereal... We have a policy in our house: if a banana turns spotty or brown, it gets peeled and put in a glass container in the freezer. These frozen bananas come in handy for smoothies and peanut butter banana ice cream, an all time favorite among kids and adults alike. Ingredients: 4 ripe bananas 2 tablespoons organic peanut butter (preferably creamy) (Yep, just two ingredients!) Directions: Peel bananas and place in a plastic freezer bag or container. Freeze for 2+ hours. You can also slice them, for... This last Saturday I had the wonderful pleasure of teaching a short class on imaginative play at Walking Stick Toys here in Missoula. Walking Stick Toys is an awesome toy store dedicated to selling all natural wood, wool, silk and cotton toys - toys that are healthy and stimulate the imagination! I love it! For those of you who missed the class, or want a refresher, here are my notes: Intro: Why play? Play is a fantastic way to learn. Play engages the brain in a way that no other act... As a naturopathic doctor specializing in pediatrics, I run a lot of food panels that test for food sensitivities. Why? Because I know that health starts with food, first and foremost, and more times than not, the symptoms I see most commonly arise because of an imbalance in the gut. Kids are notorious for having positive results show on their food sensitivity panels for dairy and eggs. I see both dairy and eggs come up elevated for sensitivity in as many as 7 out of every 10 symptomatic kiddos I... {This is a re-post Dr. Erika originally wrote for Mothers Organic Health. Check 'em out!} We've all got 'em: things that we know aren't good for us, but we do anyways. The Frappuccino addiction, potato chip binges, sushi in excess (that's a lot of mercury!), the chocolate bar dependency, energy drinks, or the extra cocktail we know we shouldn't have. Smoking, obviously, is a huge one, and is especially challenging to quit because of the physiologic addiction. But did you know t... Lorem also known as tinea pedis, is caused by a fungus. Because fungi like to grow in warm, damp, dark climates, the infection often strikes in athletes, who tend to have sweaty feet stuck in tight-fitting shoes for long periods of time. The rash can affect non-athletes as well, however, and can also be spread from person-to-person via unwashed clothes, shared towels, and even contaminated floors. The scaly, itching rash typical of athlete's foot can appear between the toes (most c... A few years ago, most of us didn't even really know what gluten was. But now, almost all of us know someone or have at least heard of someone who avoids gluten, and gluten free options have become mainstream in a lot of places. Gluten gets blamed for all sorts of maladies: constipation and diarrhea, runny noses, rashes, and even behavioral problems. So, is it the gluten? What is gluten? Gluten is a mixture of proteins found in some grains. It IS present in wheat, rye, semolina, (dairy-free) are terms that many people are now familiar with, it is not always clear why and when to avoid these foods and even if just these two are enough. The anti-inflammatory (AI) diet (and there are many versions of this) is not just one thing, but really a spectrum of dietary guidelines wher... I'm not a \"supplements\" doctor. I know many naturopathic patients who have had the experience of coming home from a visit with a bagful of pills and potions. I really try not to do that. My long-term goal as a physician is always to treat the underlying cause so we can permanently restore health. When that happens my patients no longer need to be on a supplement regime, they can use diet and lifestyle to maintain their health. (With maybe an occasional multivitamin and probiotic ... Springtime celebrations across cultures share the theme of resilience & renewal. Children have a natural ability to 'bounce back' when they encounter significant challenges and parents can play a critical role in helping to further develop this skill. When resilient kids are faced with life's obstacles, they can use them to spring forward. As parents, we are accustomed to focusing our caring attention towards the little people that surround us. So much so that, we oft... What is Vitamin B6? Vitamin B6 is a water-soluble vitamin known as pyridoxine. The active coenzyme forms of vitamin B6 are called pyridoxal 5 phosphate (PLP) and pyridoxamine 5 phosphate (PMP). Vitamin B6 performs a wide variety of functions throughout the body in these active coenzyme forms. It is involved in over 100 enzymatic reactions, many of which are a component of protein metabolism and to a lesser degree in carbohydrate and fat metabolism. Vitamin B6 is necessary for hemoglobin formatio... For teens, acne breakouts can be a huge deal, affecting not just their skin but also their emotional well being. Teens who suffer from acne are more likely to also experience low self-esteem, anxiety, and depression.1 And the rates of acne in the U.S. are increasing, with an estimated 50 million people currently affected by the condition.2 What Causes Acne? Acne is often a sign of deeper imbalances in health. Although the exact cause of acne is not entirely understood, it appears that some peopl... Does the idea of your child sleeping through the night feel like a frustrating daydream? Most parents struggle with bedtime at some point in their kid's lives. Insomnia is unfortunately common in people of all ages and it effects about 20% (i.e. 1 in 5) of children ages 5 to 12.[i] Up to 50% of kids will experience sleep issues during childhood.[ii] How Much Sleep Do Kids Really Need? Both sleep quality and quantity are important, because this is the primary time when the body rests and restor... Lorem id ele... Last week, on a beautiful walk along the river here in Missoula, I had a good talk with another Mom. We talked about life, kids, and Dr. Google. My new friend conveyed her thoughts on how helpful Google has been, and how she has found many more answers on the internet than in her doctors office. I've had hit and (many) miss experiences looking things up for Annika in the early months after she was born, so we talked about that a little as well. While we were talking I though... Studies show that children and adolescents with ADHD have significantly lower plasma and blood concentrations of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), especially omega-3s.4 This has led researchers to investigate the relationship between supplemental omega-3s and the attention and behavior problems associated with ADHD in children.4 Some data suggests mild improvements with combined omega-3 and omega-6 supplements, while others show positive effects on cognition in children who are omega-3 defici... Are you looking forward to back to school time, but dreading packing lunches every night or in a rush before your child leaves for school? How about putting children in charge of packing their own lunch? Teaching children how to pack their own lunch is a valuable lesson for a few reasons: it's a great way to teach them how to create a well-balanced meal, bringing a lunch can save money and make sure they are getting proper nutrition, and putting them in charge of this task also creates ... One of the best ways to help your little one and yourself is through the use of therapeutic massage. I often suggest Tummy Massage (or to be technical, abdominal massage) to my patients and their parents. Tummy massage can be helpful in a few different ways: a gentle tummy massage for your infant can help to soothe them and also help gently stimulate their gut to move along gas that may be causing them undue pain. Older children and adult patients greatly benefit from abdominal massage to help s... Most folks have heard by now that women need folate / folic acid, one of the B vitamins, to grow healthy babies. Women who do not consume adequate folate run a much greater risk of having a baby with a neural tube defect (NTD). The neural tube closes very early in pregnancy (28 days from conception), so the folate must be consumed from conception, or, ideally, before conception. For this reason, the United States and other countries require fortification of cereal grains with folic acid (a syn... Beige Syndrome Does your child suffer from the \"Beige syndrome?\" Toddlers are the population most affected by this common affliction. This disorder can cause vitamin and mineral deficiencies, behavioral problems, and may predispose to frequent colds and ear infections. How do you know if your child has \"Beige Syndrome?\" Take a look at their plate: is it all beige? Have they eaten nothing but crackers, crustless bread, cheese, hotdogs and milk all day? If so, then your chil... Over the past several years, I have been working with school age children in the classroom, and I have had the opportunity to teach nutrition, digestion, and elimination to the second graders of my husband's class three years in a row now. This is a lot of fun, and and we all learn a lot. As a class project, one group wrote a book about an imaginary trip through the digestive system. Here is the transcript: \"Second Grade Digestion Adventure!\" It was a normal day in second grade.... People take multivitamins because they are supposedly healthy. While I regularly prescribe vitamins and supplements for specific reasons, I do not recommend that everybody take a multivitamin. Moreover, I have been shocked at the poor quality of the ingredients in many children's multivitamins. Children have such delicate, developing neurological systems that it is imperative that if you are giving them vitamins, they must be high quality. Below is the ingredients list for a common multivitami... Packing healthy lunches that kids will eat can sometimes be tricky. Many factors make it even more difficult: conflicting dietary advice, financial and time restrictions, food sensitivities or strong preferences, and school lunch policies. Our family faces all of the above issues, and has found an approach that works. We are gluten- and dairy-free, and we also exclude peanuts. (For everyone's olfactory comfort!) School lunches are obviously not an option. Throw into that a tight budget a... Sleep does wonders for our bodies....if you are getting enough! Sleep helps to regulate the endocrine system, improve immune function, decreases inflammation, and replenishes the nervous system. We all know how we feel when we get enough sleep.....like a million bucks. So why not work your sleep routine, to get the most out of the sleep you are getting. Melatonin is a hormone that regulates our sleep-wake cycle. It is mainly secreted by the pineal gland when it is dark out (when one s... I recently saw a video shared social media that praised a mother for strictly keeping her kids away from sugar. I won't post it here, but it labelled her as the \"Anti-Fat Mom\" and the person that shared it suggested we should all try and be more like her. Ok, this got me all fired up and I've got a LOT to say about this! We need to end fat phobia. Bodies come in all shapes and sizes, largely determined by genetics. The research is pretty clear that diets don't work, especial... Apparently vanilla yogurt may help improve your mood. Researchers looking at how mood affects your food choices, and how your food choices influence your mood, gave participants various yogurts. Apparently, the low fat vanilla yogurt performed the best for improving mood. But what researchers noticed is that all yogurts had a positive effect on mood. What caused this improvement in mood? Was it the sensory experience.....or possibly the perception of something delicious? Or maybe "}
