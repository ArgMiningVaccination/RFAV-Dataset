Good health was the natural and God-given condition of humankind. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), with a pedigree of several thousand years, conceptualizes every aspect of the body and its functions radically differently from anything found in Western biomedicine. Therapeutically conservative, anthroposophical medicine concentrates on qualitatively evaluating each individual person's multidimensional body and self in illness, and on supporting with minimal intervention the innate capacities of the body/self in healing. Anthroposophy is a philosophical system developed in the early years of the twentieth century by Austrian philosopher Rudolph Steiner. Encompassing many areas of human endeavour-education, agriculture, musical and artistic expression, business, medicine, and others-anthroposophy takes a spiritual and phenomenological view of human beings and their relationship to nature and the cosmos.
