Sometimes referred to as naturopathy, natural medicine is an alternative therapy that promotes the body's self-healing systems. Natural Medicine Natura medicine also known as naturopathy uses natural remedies that have been used for centuries. [Plant based medicines](https://www.raowellness.com/a-new-study-supporting-a-plant-based-diet/), or herbal medicine, play a large role in naturopathy. Individuals incorporate herbal medicines in their health care according to their unique needs and goals to preserve their well-being.

Shakthi (Shuk-thee) means Strength, Empowerment, and Agent of Change. Frequently Asked Questions We value the importance of the relationship between the doctor and the patient. That is why Dr. Jyothi Rao has taken the time to answer some of the most commonly asked questions at Shakthi Health & Wellness. [View our FAQ page here.](https://www.raowellness.com/ask-dr-jyothi-rao/) The History of Natural Medicine Natural medicine is a practice that has existed for thousands of years. Documented examples of early indigenous peoples of North America, ancient China, and ancient Egypt demonstrate the use of plants to treat various medical conditions. These herbal therapies have been used across several cultures around the globe. As science and the application of medicine have improved the uses of these plants have become more effective. The ability to extract and modify plant ingredients allows patients to be treated with natural remedies instead of relying on pharmacological approaches. More recently, natural medicine has seen medical advancements when utilized for emergency medicine, surgical interventions, and pathology. What Is A Natural Medicine Doctor? Conventional medicine focuses on treating symptoms, instead of recognizing the intertwined network of the body's systems. Natural medicine values the critical role of this intertwined relationship and focuses treatment on this concept. Natural medicine therapies involve treating the body, the mind, and emotions to promote the healing process. Patient treatment revolves around whole-body wellness as opposed to a specific area or specific illness. Natural Medicine physicians (NDs) are licensed primary care doctors who are trained to diagnose illnesses and prescribe medications. Natural medicine doctors are required to participate in a doctoral residency program accredited by the Council on Naturopathic Medical Education (CNME). Their education and training are similar to conventional medical school but also incorporate training in clinical medicine, homeopathy, nutrition, and botanical medicine. Individuals must pass the two-part national board exam, Naturopathic Physicians Licensing Exam (NPLEX) which incorporates biomedical science and traditional clinical medicine. It is important to differentiate between a licensed ND and a naturopath provider (who can neither officially diagnose nor prescribe). These titles are not interchangeable and should not be treated like they can be. For doctors of natural medicine, the belief is that because muscles, bones, and nerves are interconnected, the body's systems are also connected. And maintaining this structured alignment is crucial for optimized vitality and self-healing. Natural medicine doctors encourage the body to restore its inherent healing ability instead of clinical therapies that suppress symptoms. These physicians who are accredited and licensed in natural medicine are able to perform physical examinations, diagnostic testing, dietary assessments, and request laboratory tests. Natural medicine providers evaluate these tests and evaluations and establish and adapt therapies to treat their patients. Examples Of Natural Medicine Therapies Natural medicine treatments are more than just the incorporation of plants and tinctures. Some of these therapies include: - Acupuncture: Our body's systems are all run by a path of nerves and veins that move our body fluids and signals from one place to the other. This energy (known as Qi in many Eastern medicines) can get blocked, and that blockage can cause health issues. Acupuncture answers this issue by using sterilized needles placed in key meridian points of those networks. These areas being stimulated help your body release that blockage and promote your body's natural ability to heal itself. - Detoxification practices: Our environment from the places we work to our own systems often finds itself overburdened by things that could end up being toxic. From chemicals to an overload in natural minerals and vitamins can cause health concerns. So, finding a way to remove those toxic elements can help individuals find a clearer path to their health and wellness. There are many detoxification processes that can be done using natural remedies from teas to a change in diet. We will work with you to find the right path for you. - Stress reduction: Stress may well be one of the biggest root causes of a lot of health concerns. So, finding techniques to reduce stress in a natural way could help alleviate a lot of current and future health issues. We offer stress reduction treatments like LET therapies, amethyst bio mat therapy, and Infrared Sauna treatments. These all use natural - Homeopathy (the use of natural substances to trigger the body's self-healing abilities): Your body is designed with systems that are meant to heal itself. But there are natural remedies like plants and minerals. We offer consultations that will help you find a natural way to enhance your body's defenses and that works the rest of your integrative medical treatment plan. This can include teas as well as vitamin IV therapy. - Herbs: One of the biggest parts of natural medicine is the use of plants and foods as a form of treatment for illness and health issues. Utilizing the natural compounds in certain herbs and spices can be beneficial to boost the functionality of your body's systems. We utilize herbal remedies as a less intrusive aid to make a more comprehensive integrative medical treatment. - Nutrition/Nutritional counseling: Food is where we get our nourishment and the vitamins and minerals we need for our bodies to function properly. That is why addressing your diet and the food you are eating can in fact help address health issues at their root. We have licensed nutritionists on hand to help our patients create diets and look into the way the food they eat interacts with their system. Not only will we create a meal plan and dietary guidelines that could help you feel better, but we will continue to help educate you about the importance of nutrition on your health with onsite classes and lectures. - Exercise therapy: One of the most natural forms of medicine is movement. Moving your body gets your systems moving properly and also is a great form of detoxification. The sweat that comes from getting your body mobbing is a natural detoxification process your body is built with. So, including exercise therapies in your integrative medicine plan like yoga could help build a better wellness path for you. - Psychotherapy: Psychotherapy is a treatment that is collaborative that relies on a relationship being built between the patient and the psychologist. Psychotherapy is talk therapy that allows the patient to be able to work through their problems. Oftentimes many physical illnesses are caused by stress and mental traumas and this is a natural way to find ways to cope or tools to use to cope with these mental traumas. Rooted in a deep history, natural medicine has proven beneficial for many patients as a treatment option. Based on traditional philosophies and the biochemical healing properties of herbs, the use of natural therapies promotes total body wellness. This encourages the prevention of illness and stimulation of the body's inherent self-healing functions. Naturopathy is a branch of treatment under an [Integrative Medicine](https://www.raowellness.com/whole-body-approaches/what-is-integrative-medicine/) medical approach. Many integrative medicine physicians recognize the complex networks existing in the body and the need to treat the whole person (body, mind, and spirit). It is incredibly beneficial for many to incorporate natural medicine therapies with Integrative Medicine practices because it does not discount the scientifically established benefits of either. This approach allows patients to attack the cause of their underlying disease while attempting to restore whole-body wellness.

Contact us Patient Testimonials I started by seeing Dr. Sudhir Rao for my Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy (RSD) Syndrome. I had an accident in July 2010 that caused nerve damage in my ankle. After treatments and surgery, it spread up the entire left side of my body. The only way to describe how you feel is by saying you're a human pinball machine ? you just never know where the pain is going to be that minute. I had asked about acupuncture because someone had told me that it worked for them. I was at the point of trying anything to lessen the pain because it was getting worse every day. - Susan Doyle I am actually a relatively healthy 50-year-old woman. I try to eat well and exercise, but I (like many) felt the creep of age in the form a subtle pounds and decreasing energy. Dr. Rao helped point me in the direction of the correct detox program for me (Core Restore!) as well as the supplements I needed to boost my metabolism and increase my energy! I still need to eat what works for me and avoid the things that don't, and I still have to exercise every day, but my clothes fit better and I have more energy!! - Shakthi Patients I came to see Dr. Rao with symptoms of chronic fatigue, abdominal pains, depression, and weight gain. I had seen a couple other doctors and they had found that I had very high inflammation levels and over 15 food allergies/sensitivities. They wanted me to just take prescription drugs, but I wanted more than a quick fix. I wanted my health and my life back! When I scheduled the appointment, I was surprised how by helpful Kelly was on the phone. I didn't know the details of my insurance coverage and Kelly offered to call my insurance for me. I've never had anyone at a doctor's office do that before. - Anna Smoot After visiting the Shakthi website and reading other patient testimonials, I was curious about the wide variety of treatments that were available. I have a very slow metabolism, was fatigued, had insomnia, back pain, and just didn't feel as well as I wanted to in general. I had more allergic reactions and respiratory issues in the preceding months before coming to see Dr. Jyothi Rao. I had completed three courses of prednisone while under the treatment of my traditional doctor and was fed up with that cycle and was looking for another path. - Debbie Helman I was given the gift of Dr. Rao's primary care for Christmas in 2016. I didn?t take advantage of it until March of 2017. My mindset at the time was negative. I had heard about changing eating habits and I felt that I liked the foods I was eating and I was nearly 70, so why change now? After meeting with Dr. Rao and hearing her suggestions, I said I would take it one small step at a time and see what happens. - Linda J. I was in the worst shape of my life with depression and anxiety. I had given up. Shakthi provided me with a manageable plan that included supplements, diet, and an exercise program that has transformed my body and given me a new outlook on life. Perhaps the most surprising outcome was learning how to be healthy and have a good relationship with my body. I am now more productive, energetic, and focused. The fog that had been clouding my thoughts has lifted. - Shakthi Patient What To Expect Natural Medicine Doctors Meet Our Doctors [Our team](https://www.raowellness.com/integrative-medicine-specialists/) is composed of skilled medical professionals who are highly knowledgeable in the practice of natural integrative therapies.
