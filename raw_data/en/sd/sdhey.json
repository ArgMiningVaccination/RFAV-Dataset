All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States Preface The U.S. government has long been at the fo refront of shaping th e internati onal policy agenda and establishing instituti ons like the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, T uberculosis (TB), and Malaria, which make the world safer for America's citizens by improving h ealth and producing more stable societies in other countries, and more humane for millions of people facing heavy disease burdens. The United States has worked with other nations to create Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, which played an important role in reducing mortality from vacc ine-preventable disease (a major contributor to the Millennial Development Goals). Working with philanthropies, the United States has also supported the creation of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, which has brought the world to the brink of declaring permanent victory over the polio virus. Furthermore, U.S. industry, foundations, and nongovernmental orga nizations have been on the frontlines in responding to global health emergencies and advancing the res earch and innovation that has helped curtail the world's most dangerous pathogens. Collaborative international efforts, especially strengthening the capacity of national health systems, are essential to prevent and prep are for an array of threats, from infectious disease pandemics to the silent killers of chronic noncommunicable diseases. The committee grappled with striking the right balance in fulfilling its mandate to examine the United States' role on the future of global health while refl ecting that the United States\u2014as a member of the global community of states\u2014has common challenge s and lessons to learn from others to influence our future. The committee prioritized global health challenges with the potential for catastrophic loss of life and impact on society and the economy\u2014su ch as pandemics, persistent communicable diseases (HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria), and noncommunicable diseases (cardiovascular health and select cancers)\u2014as well as areas where signi ficant U.S. investment has created gains that should be consolidated and sustained\u2014such as promoting women and children's health, building capacity, and global health innovation and implementation. The Committee on Global Health and the Future of the United States conclude d that the U.S. government should maintain its leadership position in global health as matter of urgent national interest and as a global public benefit that enhances Ameri ca's international standing. While additional investment is required, more money alone is not the answer. The report offers 14 significant recommendations to strengt hen U.S global health programs, recognizing that many other areas are worthy of attention. In order to maximize work toward the prioritized global health challenges (chapters 3 to 6) the co mmittee focused on how to better leverage U.S. resources by doing business differently, especia lly through the use of improved research and development processes and digital health (chapter 7), smart financing mechanisms to maximize returns on U.S. investments (chapt er 8) and demonstrating leader ship within the global health architecture and governance (chapter 9). We would like to thank the members of th e committee for their devotion of time and energy to this project. It wa s a privilege and a pleasure to work with our fellow committee members, to learn from them in their respective ar eas of expertise, and to engage with them in hearty discourse about the issues at hand. Many other experts also gave generously of their time and expertise to contribute to our information gathering, and their contributions are deeply appreciated.

All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States PREP UBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS S-1 Summary By investing in global health over the next 20 ye ars, there is a chance to save the lives of m illions of children and adults. Beyond these health benefits to individuals, global heath is directly linked to economic productivity and gr owth worldwide. According to the Lancet Commission on Investing in Hea lth, the return on investments in global health can be substantial\u2014 as the benefits can exceed the costs by a factor between 9 and 20, for low-income and lower middle-income countries, respectively. Worldwide, investing in core capacities to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease outbreaks through the development of multidisciplinary \"One Health\" systems focused on the interface of human and animal health can result in an estimated savings of $15 billion a nnually from the prevention of outbreaks alone. In light of these benefits, as well as the continual emergence and reemergence of infectious diseases and the growing threat of antim icrobial resistance, a sustaina ble commitment to global health security is an imperative for all nations. The United States has long been a leader in global health, incl uding through such high- profile programs as the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR); the President's Malaria Initiative; the Global Fund to Fight AIDS , Tuberculosis, and Malaria; Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance; and more recently the Global Health Security Agenda. However, resources are not unlimited, and the case for continued commitment must be made. Against the backdrop of the influential legacy of the United States on the glob al health stage, the new administration is now faced with the choice of whether or not to ensure that gains in global health\u2014won with billions of U.S. dollars, years of dedication, and strong programs\u2014are sustained and poised for further growth. THE CASE FOR CONTINUED COMMI TMENT TO GLOBAL HEALTH The tremendous growth in international travel and trade that has occurred over the last several decades heightens the urgency of continued investments in global health. The resulting increased interconnectedness of the world and interdependency of countries, economies, and cultures have brought improved access to goods and services, but also a variety of health threats. Foreign assistance is often considered a type of charity, or support for the less fortunate. Although this can be true for the poorest and most vulnerable populations, the majority of such aid, especially when direct ed toward health, is an investment in the health of the recipient country, as well as that of the United States and the world at la rge. This investment motivation for the United States is two-pronged\u2014to secure protection against global health threats and to promote productivity and economic growth in othe r countries. While the burden of infectious diseases rests predominantly with low-income c ountries, these diseases represent global threats that could have dire consequences for any count ry, including the United St ates, in terms of both human and economic costs. Approximately 284,000 d eaths were attributed to the 2009 H1N1 influenza outbreak, for example, and 2 million excess deaths are projected for a future moderate influenza pandemic. In only a few short months in 2003, the outbreak of se vere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) cost the world $40-$54 billio n, while in 2014, the United States alone Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States S-2 GLOBAL HEALTH AND THE FUTURE ROLE OF THE UNITED STATES PREP UBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS committed $5.4 billion in response to the Ebola outbreak, $119 million of which was spent on domestic screening and follo w-up of airline passengers. The increasing prevalence of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) also has negatively affected global economies, threatening societal gains in life expectancy, productivity, and overall quality of life. The produ ctivity losses associated with disability, unplanned absences from work, and increased accidents incur costs as much as 400 percent higher than the costs of treatment. Research also has shown that i nvestors are less likely to enter markets where the labor force suffers a heavy disease burden. Thus, healthy populations are important on multiple levels. Investing in human capital contri butes significantly to economic gr owth, prosperity, and stability in countries and creates more reli able and durable partners in th e world. This strategy has proven successful, as evidenced by the fact that 11 of the top 15 trading partners of the United States are former recipients of foreign assistance. In this context, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine were charged with conducting a consensus study to identify global health pr iorities in light of current and emerging global health threats and challe nges and providing recommendations to the U.S. government and other stakeholders for increasing responsiveness, coordina tion, and efficiency in addressing these threats and challenges by establishing priorities and mobilizing resources. With support from a broad array of federal agencies, foundations, and private pa rtners, an ad hoc 14- member committee was appointed to carry out th is task over the course of 6 months. RECOMMENDATIONS Based on a rigorous and evidence-based consensus process, committee members formulated a set of 14 recommendations that, if implemented, will deliver a strong global health strategy and allow the United States to maintain it s role as a global health leader (see Table S- 1). 1 The arguments supporting these recommendations are summarized in the section below on four priority areas for action. TABLE S-1 Committee Recommendations and Corresponding Actions Recommendation Actions 1 Improve international emergency response coordination. 2 Combat antimicrobial resistance. 3 Build public health capacity in lo w- and middle-income countries. 4 Envision the next generation of the Pr esident's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. 5 Confront the threat of tuberculosis. 6 Sustain progress toward malaria elimination. 1 The full text of these recommendations can be found in Chapter 10 of the report.

Four Priority Areas for Action The landscape of global health is vast, and with new and sometimes disparate priorities across the health sector, considering each i ssue or disease in its own silo can be counterproductive. Such a narrow perspective hinders the ability to leverage investments in other programs and adapt resources from existing prog rams when a new threat arises. Thus, while prioritization of resources is necessary, it is al so essential to embrace more holistic, system- focused concepts of integrati on, capacity building, a nd partnership to achieve results more comprehensively. With this understanding, the comm ittee identified four priority areas for global health action that it believes, if addressed, will result in the greatest pos itive effect on global health. 1.Achieve global health security In the last 10 years, outbreaks of potentially pandemic influenza, Mi ddle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), Ebola, an d most recently Zika have threatened populations around the world. In each case, gl obal and national responses, including those of the United States, have been reacti onary, uncoordinated, ineffective, and highly costly. Absent the establishment of fu ndamental public health protections and preparedness capabilities at home and abroad, the world will never be ready to prevent, detect, and respond to such outbreaks. A solid commitment in the form of a sustainable mechanism for addressing these global threats is a critical need. The committee urges the administration to create a coordinating body within the U.S. government with the authority and budget to develop a proactive, cost-effective, and comprehensive approach to preparedness for and response to internati onal public health emergencies. In addition, the committee calls for continued investme nts at the national level\u2014and increased investments at the international level\u2014to im prove capabilities to confront the growing and alarming threat of antimicrobial resi stance. Finally, the U.S. government should strengthen preparedness and response capacity in low- and middle-income countries through training and information exchange efforts (see Recommendations 1, 2, and 3).Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States S-4 GLOBAL HEALTH AND THE FUTURE ROLE OF THE UNITED STATES PREP UBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 2.Maintain a sustained response to the con tinuous threats of comm unicable diseases Dedicated efforts of national governments, foundations, and the gl obal community have resulted in millions of lives saved from AIDS , tuberculosis (TB), and malaria, yet all three diseases continue to pose immediate and longer-term threats to the health of populations around the world. More than 36 m illion people are living with HIV, with 2 million new infections occurring each year. TB disproportionately affects the poorest populations of the world, killing 1.4 million each year, while dangerous resistant strains are becoming more prevalent and easily spread. The mortality rate due to malaria hasdecreased by more than 60 percent in the la st 10 years, but those infected can lose 25 percent of their family's income as a resu lt of their lost productivity, affecting the prosperity of the society at large as well. The committee believes that a sustained focus on HIV/AIDS and malaria and a reevaluation of the commitment to fighting TB are imperative to prevent reversal of the gains ach ieved in the last few decades and avoid the further spread of resistant strains for a ll three diseases (see Recommendations 4, 5, and 6). 3.Save and improve the lives of women and children Efforts to save the lives of women and childre n across the globe have historically been an important focus for the U.S. government. A lthough child and maternal mortality rates have decreased since 2000, each year nearly 6 million children die before their fifth birthday, and more than 300,000 women die from pregnancy- and childbirth-related causes. The vast majority of these deaths are preventable. The committee urges the U.S. government to continue its commitment to th is survival agenda but also expand it to incorporate early childhood development as a key element. If curre nt survival-focused programs can be complemented by a strong multisector focus on childhood development,the committee sees an opportunity to foster heal thy families, resulting in turn in resilient societies and growing economies (see Recommendations 7 and 8). 4.Promote cardiovascular health and prevent cancer Infectious diseases often captivate the media, but an equally importa nt concern is rising rates of NCDs, such as cardiovascular dise ase (CVD) and cancer, in countries around the world, regardless of income level. The cost s of managing these diseases are rising as well. CVD alone is projected to cost the world $1 trillion annu ally in treatment costs and productivity losses by 2030. However, because of their historical focus on infectious diseases, many health systems in low- and middle-income countries are not adequately equipped to care for patients with NCDs. The need to fill these gaps often goes unmetbecause of other priorities, but their preven tion and treatment can be built into existing platforms for other areas, such as HIV/AIDS or maternal and child health. The committeecalls for improved mobilization and coordination of private partners at the country level and across the U.S. interagency community to implement strategies proven to ensure the highest impact. These strategies include targ eting CVD risk factors, early detection and treatment of hypertension and cervical can cer, and immunization against vaccine- preventable cancers (see Recommendation 9).Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States SUMMARY S-5 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Maximizing Returns on Investments in Global Health To have the greatest effect in the above priority areas, the committee identified three cross-cutting areas for action to maximize the returns on investments, achieve better health outcomes, and use funding more effectively: (1 ) catalyze innovation through both the accelerated development of medical products and integrated digital health infrastructure; (2) employ more nimble and flexible financing mechanisms to leve rage new partners and funders in global health; and (3) maintain U.S. status and influence as a world leader in global he alth while adhering to evidence-based science and economics, measur ement, and accountability (see Recommendations 10 through 14). Achieving true improvements in global health will require changing the way global health business is conduc ted to better enable innovation. Adequately protecting U.S. citizens at home and abroad necessitates not only investment in U.S. infrastructure, but also continued awareness of global issues and active e ngagement in the intern ational global health arena. Many of the events and elements of the changing global health landscape described throughout this report have crea ted an environment for a centralized and comprehensive strategy for U.S. global health diplomacy. To these ends , a change in approach and long-term visioning across the various U.S. agencies involved in glob al health will be necessary, with an emphasis on integration and partnership. The committee wishes to emphasize that strong collaboration and cooperation among donors, national governments, nongovernmental organizations, and private companies will be essential to achieving the propos ed global health goals. Health effects extend far beyond the health sector, and addressing them will therefore require cross-sectoral interaction and synergy. While existing multilateral institutions continue to be crucial, engaging in new and more productive partnerships with other donor governments and the private sector can augment multilateral networks and lead to more succ essful outcomes moving forward. These joint investments should be geared toward harmonized approaches to global public goods and general global health goals shared by all co untries. Finally, to have the grea test effect, all global health work should incorporate essentia l principles of community incl usion and cultural competency. CONCLUSION The United States cannot ignor e the reality that the heal th and well-being of other countries affect both directly and indirectly the health, safe ty, and economic security of Americans. For many years, strong bipartisanship has backed U.S. engagement in global health, with active support from the faith community, private industry, f oundations, and civil society. To sustain the proud U.S. legacy in global healt h, the committee encourages the administration to focus on the above key areas and cross-cu tting opportunities a nd to implement the recommendations set forth in this report. Th e committee believes that implementing evidence- based interventions, modifying country engage ment strategies, expl oring new investment mechanisms, and taking a more proactive and system atic approach to global health priorities will make the U.S. government's current efforts in gl obal health more efficient and cost-effective. The United States must preserve and extend its le gacy as a global leader , partner, and innovator in global health through forward- looking policies, a long-term vi sion, country and international partnerships, and, most importantly, continued investment. Doing so wi ll not only lead to improved health and security for all U.S. citizens but also ensure the sust ainable thriving of the global population. Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Growing forces for globalization have increased the interconnectedness of the world and the interdependency amongst countries, econo mies, and cultures. Monumental growth in international travel and trade has brought im proved access to goods and services for many, but such growth carries with it an ongoing and ever-present global threat of zo onotic spillover and infectious disease outbreaks, including in recent years avian influenza, Ebola, Zika, and chikungunya. This threat intensifies each year in the face of diminished budgets, especially when considering the corresponding increase in ur banization and population density worldwide. Simultaneously, noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) have continued to grow in prevalence and impact on economies, threatening societal gain s in life expectancy and quality (WEF, 2017). Many countries now face a rising burden of NCDs such as cardiovascular disease and cancer, while still trying to eliminate such diseases as tuberculosis (TB), malaria, and human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS). Unfortunately, many health care systems in these countries are not designed to care for noncommunicable diseases and current infrastructure lacks a focus on integrated care, a properly trained workforce, and effective population-level policies\u2014elements that can significantly improve these serious health burdens. Over the last few decades, the United States has significantly contributed to global health successes in key priority areas, such as HIV/AIDS , malaria, research and development for health security threats, and saving the lives of mothers and children, as illustrated in Table 1-1. Even more recent commitment is evident through the creation and dedication of the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA) and efforts to combat antimicrobial resistance (AMR) at the national and international levels. While the world's atte ntion is easily captured by infectious disease events like Ebola or Zika, it is al so important to address the burdens of chronic diseases plaguing populations and adversely affecti ng their economic growth. Identifyi ng cross-cutting solutions to address all facets of health is necessary for sustainable progress. The gains bought with billions of U.S. dollars are poised to be sust ained and grown, or phased down and lost. A loss of focus in key priority areas\u2014responding to disease outbr eaks; sustaining gains in HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria; ignoring the health of women and childr en; or disregarding the growing imperative of the NCD burden\u2014would be a tremendous opportunity loss for the United States and humanity. 1 The Millennium Development Goals are \"The world's time-bound and quantified targets for addressing extreme poverty in its many dimensions - income poverty, hunger, disease, lack of adequate shelter, and exclusion - while promoting gender equality, education, and environmental sust ainability. They are also basic human rights-the rights of each person on the planet to health, education, shelter, and security\" (Millennium Project, 2006). Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

HISTORICAL CONTEXT FOR THIS STUDY For decades, the United States has been involved in foreign aid and glob al health in some capacity. Various efforts and programs were expa nded following the creation of the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) in 2003 and the President's Ma laria Initiative (PMI) in 2005. Since the establishment of these two initiatives, along with the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria in the early part of the 21st century, the field of global health has seen tremendous growth and has evolved through a proliferation of nonprofit and private foundations, with a keen interest in and commit ment to improving the health of vulnerable populations around the world. While these changes we re occurring over the past two decades, the National Academies of Sciences , Engineering, and Medicine c onducted two consensus studies on this topic, charged with advising future gove rnment leadership on areas of prioritization within the growing field of global health.

All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States INTRODUCTION 1-3 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Past Institute of Medicine Reports on Global Health Twenty years ago, the Institute of Medicine's (IOM's) Boar d on International Health was commissioned to produce the firs t report directly addressing the United States' interest in and commitment to improving human health on a global scale. The report, America's Vital Interest in Global Health: Protecting Our People, Enhancing Our Economy, and Advancing Our International Interests (1997), construed global health as \"h ealth problems, issues, and concerns that transcend national boundaries, and may best be addr essed by cooperative actions\" (IOM, 1997, p.2). Twelve years later, an independent committee was formed by the IOM Board on Global Health to prepare a new report, The U.S. Commitment to Global Health : Recommendations for the New Administration (2009), to advise the incoming Obama administration. The 2009 committee was tasked with assessing U.S. efforts in global health and making recommendations about future priorities a nd opportunities to improve health worldwide, while also protecting and promoting U.S. interests. Due to the breadth of the statement of task and the time constraints of the study, the comm ittee's approach was to focus on the directions needed for the future. The committee was not able to conduct an in-depth review of these two previous reports and the progress made since thei r release. However, several themes from those reports emerged in initial discussions to in form the committee's deliberations, with some outlined in this chapter (see Appendix A fo r more detail on the previous IOM reports' recommendations and the advancements in global health since their release). The IOM's 1997 report America's Vital Interest in Global Health showed that, even 20 years ago, there was an appreciation for th e interconnectedness of the world and the interdependency of the United Stat es with other countries. As the report underscored, \"the direct interests of the American people are best served when the United States acts decisively to promote health around the world\" (IOM, 1997, p.2). Al so included in that report were calls for better structuring of market ince ntives for the needed developmen t of critical medical products, an area that the global health community still struggles with today. Since then, however, the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Prepared ness and Response established the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) through the 2006 Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act, 2 which incentivizes the private sect or to collaborate, develop, and ensure surge capacity for drug and vaccine manuf acturing through cost sharing mechanisms and partnerships with the U.S. government. Th e U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Priority Review Voucher program, established in 2007 (Ridley, n.d.), also spurs development by allowing for expedited FDA review of certain ty pes of new drugs (e.g., products to treat Ebola became eligible in 2014). Additionally, with th e recent launch of the Co alition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation in January 2017, it is clear this need for drug and vaccine development in an uncertain market is still a priority and will require international public- and private-sector collaboration. The 2009 IOM report The U.S. Commitment to Global Health followed an explosion of global health programs and an increase in to tal global health funding between 2000 and 2008. To generate and share knowledge, as well as build ca pacity, the report called upon the U.S. research sector to collaborate with gl obal partners, establish information sharing networks, and support academia and health systems in low-and middle- income countries (LMICs) through country-led workforce development and the creation of national health plans (IOM, 20 09). Progress in health research collaboration since 2009 includes the Partnerships for Enhanced Engagement in 2 Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act, Pub. Law.

Additionally, the formation of the medi cal education partnership initiative and nursing education partnership initiative, developed through the PEPFAR program to address the severe workforce shortage of health workers in high-burden HIV/AIDS countries, has enhanced workforce capacity (see Chapter 4). Perhaps the most notable recommendation of the 2009 report was to improve coordination across the U.S. government by creating a White House Interagency Committee on Global Health, chaired by a senior official designat ed by the president, to be tasked with leading, planning, prioritizing, and coordinating the budget for major U.S. government global health programs and activities. This concept was implem ented through the launch of the Global Health Initiative (GHI) in 2009 by President Obama. Ho wever, with an initiative spanning so many agencies and health areas, its success depended on strong authority and budget given to the GHI organizers. Unfortunately, it received neither , and by 2012, the committee found that GHI had little more than a Web presence coordinating priority area global hea lth programs. Though full U.S. government interagency coordination and cooperation in global health was not realized in the past 10 years, many smaller-sca le coordination efforts have been successful, such as Feed the Future, PEPFAR, PMI, and most recently the GHSA. The committee feels that coordinating efforts within a manageable scope with dedi cated funding, leadership, and accountability is feasible and should be a key consideration as the new administration looks to the future to shape U.S. global health programs. STUDY CHARGE, A PPROACH, AND SCOPE In follow-up to the 1997 and 2009 IOM reports on global health priorities, a broad array of stakeholders sponsored the National Academie s of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine to conduct a similar consensus study to review change s in the global health landscape over the last 10 years and assess future priorities. In additi on, this expert committee was tasked with making recommendations on how to improve responsivene ss, coordination, and efficiency within the U.S. government and across the global health field. Finally, the committee was charged with guiding the new administration, as well as other funders and globa l health actors, in setting future priorities and mobilizing resources (see Bo x 1-1 for the full statement of task). Federal sponsors of this study included the Merck Foundati on, the National Institute s of Health (NIH), PEPFAR, the Rockefeller Foundation, the United St ates Agency for International Development (USAID), the U.S. Food and Drug Administra tion, BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company), and Medtronic, demonstrating the diversity of entiti es that understand the importance of global health issues and trends. The recommendations that th e committee has developed are far reaching and applicable to multiple agencies and stakehol ders, including nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), private-sector companies, and national ministries of hea lth in other countries. However, as the U.S. government maintains its role as a leader in global health, the committee directs many of these recommendations to the new admi nistration and federal agency leaders and hopes the U.S. government will continue to lead thr ough action, and in partne rship and collaboration with the numerous public and private stak eholders on the global health stage.

Reflective of this and of the opport unity presented by a new administration, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine will convene an ad hoc consensus committee to reassess and update the public- and private-sector roles in contributing to and deriving benefit from improved global health in its broadest sense\u2014 meaning, health beyond health care. The U.S. Commitment to Global Health and its predecessor, the 1997 IOM study titled America's Vital Interest in Global Health: Protecting Our People, Enhancing Our Economy, and Advancing Our International Interests , both influenced public and private funding and the shaping of priorities for global health. While these reports resulted in many improvements, some of their recommendations are yet to be fulfilled. The committee will begin its task by reviewing where the two prior reports resulted in more effective investments in global health initiatives and where recommendations were not taken up. The committee will then assess the current global health landscape and how it has evolved over the last 8 years. After reviewing these issues, the committee will offer conclusions and recommendations to guide the new administration, as well as other funders and global health actors, in setting future priorities and mobilizing resources. The committee will also review U.S. governmental external leadership and internal coordination of the global health enterprise and offer recommendations on how to improve responsiveness and efficiency. The audience for this report will include the private sector (in the United States, other industrialized countries, and developing countries), the U.S. and foreign governments, and international organizations. Beyond demographic trends, the committee will consider relevant global changes over this period, including increased forces for globalization that foster the movement of people (including health care workers), microbes, food, and pharmaceuticals, increasing America's interdependency with other countries; aspects of globalization that increase the opportunities and challenges associated with greater global engagement in medical research and development; the 2015 culmination of the timeframe for the Millennium Development Goals and the initiation of the era of the Sustainable Development Goals; the commitment to an AIDS-free generation; the commitment to quality universal health care; the increasing privatization of health care delivery in many parts of the world; achieved and likely advances in technology and health systems design that could improve the potential for disease prevention, recognition, response, and eradication; technological advances that could raise the potential for naturally occurring and manmade biological agents to accidently or intentionally spread beyond national borders; the growing frequency of global infectious disease epidemics affecting health and family welfare, trade, migration, and security; the growing global epidemic of antimicrobial drug resistance and the lack of a Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Two of the meetings included information- gathering sessions from sponsor representatives a nd additional subject area content experts. The agendas from these two meetings can be found in Appendix C. To better understand the challenges and successes of programs implemented in other countries, the committee also distributed an information gathering request vi a SurveyGizmo to 12 USAID health directors and 40 CDC country directors, asking respondents to give qualitative re sponses to questions regarding their work with U.S. global health pr ograms (see Box 1-2).

The wide range of health conditions that afflict the globa l population was investigated in the 2015 Global Burden of Disease Study, which found that 315 conditions contributed to the majority of global disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) 4 in 2015 (Kassebaum et al., 2016). The same study identified 79 behavioral, environmental, occupational, and metabolic risk factors to health that can be addressed (Forouzanfar et al., 2016). Beyond specific disease and risk factors there is increasing recognition of the influence of climate change and the environment on global health. While these challenges are all important, the committee has decided to focus this report on areas it believes the United States can have th e most immediate and substantial impact, given the limited resources available. The committee focu sed on areas that met three specific criteria: (1) areas that the United States has existing investments and deep expertise, (2) areas that are identified as high priority by cu rrent efforts such as the Sustainable Development Goals and the Global Burden of Disease Study, (3) and areas where specific interventions with strong evidence have been identified. By focusing the analyses and recommendations the committee hopes that it enables U.S. government agencies to optimally de ploy scarce resources to interventions with the greatest potential impact to improve health outcomes in a cost-effective manner. Though this report was not able to highlight every major global health issue, the committee emphasizes that the omission of certain t opics is not meant to understate their critical nature. Sectors such as mental health and subs tance abuse, environmental health (including food safety, air pollution, and water and sanitation is sues), refugee health, and health workforce 4 The burden of disability associated with a disease or di sorder can be measured in units called disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). DALYs repr esent the total number of years lost to illn ess, disability, or premature death within a given population.

In fact, the global burden of mental illness accounted for up to 13 percent of global DALYs (Vigo et al., 2016), and injuries resulted in approximately 8.5 percent of global deaths in 2015 (Wang et al., 2016). Sustaining a health workforce will be important as well. Populations are growing, and health systems are struggling to keep up. In fact, the World Health Organization estimates the world will be short 12.9 million health care workers by 2035 (WHO, 2013). This shortage could have serious repercussions, which the committee acknowledges as a pressi ng issue in all countries. As the United States continues to reform health care and medical and public health professional education, it will need to work multilaterally to better unders tand the causes and effects of workforce reduction in health care. Despite the focused approach proposed in this report, the committee also strongly believes the United States has an important lead ership role to play in shaping policy across global health challenges\u2014even when specifi cally resourced operational programs are not possible. For example, helping to shape the polic y debate on the role of climate change on global health is absolutely critical in light of recent experiences such as the Zika virus. The effects of climate change on health will be felt in the fo rm of malnutrition, drought, extreme temperatures, worsened air quality, and infectious disease spillover\u2014and mitigation of these effects will require work well beyond the health sector, necessitating multidisciplinary collaboration and action (USGCRP, 2016). As such, the committee recogni zed that an effort on climate change and health would require work and expertise outside the scope of this study, but agrees a multidisciplinary investigation is needed. Across th e global health landscape, experts in the U.S. government should continue to participate and shape the discourse on these important topics. ORGANIZATION OF THE REPORT Throughout this report are references to changes that are required for the United States to better participate as a leader in global health in the 21st century. While acknowledging that much progress has been made in the field in the past 10 years, the committee believes there is still much to be done. This report presents the committee's findings, conclusions, and recommendations for future global health priori ties of the U.S. administration and its global health partners. The structure of the report reflects the two key themes motivating the investment in global health by the United St ates: securing against global thr eats and enhancing productivity and economic growth. The final section on Maximizi ng Returns is cross-cutting as its contents encompass methods that should be applied to all of the focus areas within this report (see Figure 1-1).

Life expectancy has risen worldwide, child survival has almost doubled, and the global community has turned the tide of deadly diseases. Yet, at the same time, the spread of urbanization, the sp eed of global travel and the movement of goods, increased consumption of animal protein, and climate chan ge have facilitated the emergence and rapid spread of infectious diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndr ome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), pandemic influenza, Ebola virus, and Zika virus (Burkle, 2017). Additionally, drought, famine, war, and country conflicts have led to international humanitarian and refugee crises , creating unstable conditions in which radical ideologies and diseases can thrive (WEF, 2017). Historically, the United States has made major investments in global platforms and initiatives th at have largely enabled containment of threats like infectious disease before they reach th e United States and promoted global security, stability, and prosperity. Examples of such investments include human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficienc y syndrome (HIV/AIDS) treatm ent, infectious disease surveillance and response, vaccine development, and maternal and child health improvement. These investments have also benefited U.S. busin esses both in terms of enabling a growing base of healthy, prosperous customers, as well as en suring the safety of U.S. multinational operations around the world, and facilitated th e continued leadership of the United States in research and development in biomedical sciences and tec hnologies (Daschle and Frist, 2015; Lima, 2013; Wagner, 2015). However, competing priorities and demands on government funding create an imperative for the United States to examine the economic bene fits of investments in global health for the economy, national security, innova tion, and global standing. Shifts in global economies and private sector engagement are changing the natu re of these investments (Sturchio and Goel, 2012). In the past decade, many countries that ha ve historically received foreign aid have begun experiencing economic growth and rising middle cl asses. This growth has allowed traditional aid recipient countries to expand their tax base. In fact, through taxati on and mobilization of domestic resources, the funds co llected between 2000 and 2014 in s ub-Saharan Africa rose from $100 billion to $461 billion (Runde and Savoy, 2016). The growth of many multinational businesses has also forced business executives to adopt a more global perspective regarding long-term planning, workforce development, and safety. As a country plans for both its own future and that of the world, a prudent step is to assess current investments and adapt them to reflect these global changes. A lthough great progress has been achieved toward the completion of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) 1 since their launch in 2000, there are still 1 The Millennium Development Goals are \"The world's time-bound and quantified targets for addressing extreme poverty in its many dimensions\u2014income poverty, hunger, disease, lack of adequate shelter, and exclusion\u2014while Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States 2-2 GLOBAL HEALTH AND THE FUTURE ROLE OF THE UNITED STATES PREPUBLICATION DRAFT: UNCORRECTED PROOFS unfinished agendas. The transition in 2016 to the multidisciplinary Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) illustrates the continued commitment to end poverty, save the planet, and ensure prosperity for all. There is a chance to save the lives of millions of children and adults by investing in global health over the next 20 years (Jamison et al., 2013). Furthermore, investing in health has benefits beyond saving lives and is cons idered to have made th e largest contribution to sustainable development (Jamison et al., 2016) . According to the Lancet Commission on Investing in Health, achie ving a grand convergence in global health by 20352\u2014reducing infectious disease, maternal, and child deaths down to universally low levels within a generation\u2014is estimated to produce benefits that would exceed th e costs of investment between 9 and 20 times for low and lower-middle-income countries, respectively3 (Jamison et al., 2013; Yamey et al., 2016). This chapter identifies the benefits of globa l health investment for the United States, discusses the current spending of the United States on global h ealth programs, and explores opportunities for future investment based on trends affecting health such as globalization, the SDG agenda, and private sector involvement. WHY GLOBAL HEALTH FUNDING PROTECTS U.S. INTERESTS There will likely always be a demand for U.S. support when it comes to disaster relief and humanitarian efforts because the U.S. respons e system excels at logistics and operations. But disaster response must be complemented by inve stment in programs and countries during steady state times\u2014acknowledging the pub lic health mantra of \"An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.\" Money spent on improvements to infrastructure, workforce training, and response systems\u2014both in the United States and abroad\u2014protects Americans from threats such as emerging infectious diseases or bioterror a ttacks. Such investments help to build everyday resilience so communities are prepared for all types of disasters, whether they take the form of a bus crash, an active shooter event, or an Ebola outbreak. Similarly, invest ing in the development of countries around the world thro ugh partnerships and capacity bu ilding can help foster stable economies with sufficient opportunities for their citi zens, discouraging them from feeling forced to flee their country. Stable countries with gr owing middle class populations are more likely to become trading partners and to purchase U.S. goods; 11 of the top 15 U.S. trading partners are former recipients of U.S. foreign assistance programs (InterAction, 2011). Moreover, beyond just trading partners, the shared burden of noncommu nicable diseases (NCDs) around the world is a strong justification for health and scientific partnerships that ca n lead to shared solutions to common problems. Many aid-recipien t countries suffer from similar health burdens to those in the United States, such as hypertension, cancer , poor maternal health, or depression. promoting gender equality, education, and environmental sust ainability. They are also basic human rights-the rights of each person on the planet to health, education, shelter, and security\" (Millennium Project, 2006). 2 Achieving convergence would require significant increases in health spending in low- and lower-middle-income countries\u2014$30 billion in low-in come countries and $61 billion in lower-mi ddle-income countries in 2035. Expected economic growth, together with other sources of revenue, such as ta xes on tobacco and removal of subsidies on fossil fuels, will enable low- income countries to finance most of this agenda on their own, while middle-income countries will easily be able to leverage resour ces domestically (Summers and Jamison, 2013). 3 This estimate was found using a full income approach, wher e income growth plus the value of life years gained in that period results in a change in a country's full income over a time period. This accounts for the omission of reduced mortality risk in typical gross domestic product (GDP) measures to give a more complete picture (Summers and Jamison, 2013).

All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States INVESTING IN GLOBAL HEALTH FOR AMERICA 2-3 PREPUBLICATION DRAFT: UNCORRECTED PROOFS The reasons for U.S. investment in globa l health are numerous, but with so many competing priorities, limited resources dictate prioritizati on. However, providing foreign assistance through overseas development aid (ODA), a nd acting in the best interest of the United States can often be accomplished simultaneously. Th e recent change in administration in the U.S. political system is a chance to pause and take a more holistic view of each of the elements of current global health investments as part of an in terconnected system. In this process, it is critical to consider the longer-term consequences that wi ll arise from near-term decisions on the future of investments in global health. EXISTING U.S. GLOBAL HEALTH SPENDING Since 2000, U.S. funding for global health has grown from $1.7 billion to $8.47 billion in 2009 (Salaam-Blyther, 2013), increasing on an average of 19.53 percent per year. The 2009 Institute of Medicine (IOM) report U.S. Commitment to Global Health called for an increase in the budget for global health programs, urging the U.S. government to invest $15 billion annually in global health by 2012, of which $13 billion should be directed toward the MDGs and $2 billion toward NCDs and injuries. Unfortuna tely, the timing of th e Great Recession of 2008 likely impacted this call for ac tion, and while funding did increas e slightly, annual U.S. global health funding continued to hover around $10 bil lion from 2009 to 2015 (Valentine et al., 2016), with approximately $6.5 billion dedicated to global HIV/AIDS efforts (KFF, 2012).4 Compared to prior years, annual growth in global hea lth spending has only b een 1.6 percent between 2010 and 2016 (IHME, 2017). The most recent budget request from Pres ident Obama for FY2017 included $10.3 billion in total funding for global health programs (V alentine et al., 2016). According to Valentine and colleagues, within the international affairs budget, most of the global health funding ($8.6 billion) in the FY2017 request is provided thr ough the Global Health Programs (GHP) account at the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and the U.S. Department of State, including funding for the Presid ent's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and the President's Malaria Initiative. For a full breakdown of the GH P account, which does not include global health money spent by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) or the U.S. Department of Defense, see Figure 2-1. In its an alysis of the global health budget, the Kaiser Family Foundation noted that Congress has approve d higher funding levels fo r global health than those in the president's budget request for each of th e past 4 fiscal years. However, whether that trend will continue is unclear. 4 Appropriated U.S. funding for global health between 2009 and 2016 fluctuated: $8.46 billion in 2009, $9.016 billion in 2010, $8.86 billion in 2011 (Salaam-Blyther, 2013), $9.8 billion in 2012. $9.6 billion in 2013, $10.2 billion in 2014, $10.2 billion in 2015, and 10.2 billion in 2016 (Valentine et al., 2016).

SOURCES: KFF, 2016; NIH, 2017. Perceptions of U.S. Global Health Spending The American public approves of the United St ates taking a leading or major role in solving international problems, as revealed by a 2016 Kaiser Family Foundation survey of Americans on the United States's role in globa l health (Hamel et al ., 2016). Striking though, is that half of Americans think the United States is spending too much on foreign aid, until they learn that foreign aid spending is just 1 percen t of the budget (Hamel et al., 2016). Global health spending, specifically, was only about 0.26 percent5 of the budget in 2016. On average, survey participants estimated foreign aid spending at 31 percent of the budget (Hamel et al., 2016). After being informed of true foreign aid expendi tures, \"7 in 10 Americans believe that the current level of U.S. foreign spending on health is too little or about right\" (Hamel et al., 2016). While the United States contributes greatly to global aid, other donor countries are just as critical to ensuring robust development assi stance in health across the globe . In fact, the United States actually contributes a lower percentage of its gross national income (GNI)6 than other high- income countries, with ODA at only 0.17 percent of GNI for the United States\u2014below the levels of other high-income countries such as Germ any, Sweden, or the United Kingdom, and well below the United Nations target of 0.7 (see Figure 2-2). Additionally, 75 percent of Americans surveyed think th e United States should give money to multilateral health organizations, such as the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria; Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance (Gav i); the United Nations; and the World Health Organization (WHO), to improve hea lth in other countries. These fi ndings indicate that there is broad recognition of the advantages of leveraging the different stre ngths of these organizations to complement the United States' stre ngth as a bilateral donor (Hamel et al., 2016). As the role of foreign assistance in global health continues to shift in the coming years, it will be essential to consider the importance of other national gove rnments and global play ers as partners in providing development and health aid, and the pote ntial of synergized e fforts towards shared global goals. 5 Global health spending as a percen t of the budget was calculated by using 2016 enacted global health funding ($10.2 billion) from Valentine et al. (2016) and total spending ($3.9 trillion) from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO, 2017). 6 Gross national income is the sum of a country's gross domestic product plus net income received from overseas (OECD, 2016).

Leveraging Globalization for Improved Global Health Despite the increase in risks of food secu rity, air pollution, and infectious disease outbreaks, globalization has driv en innovation for the health a nd business sectors. Increased international trade leads to global competiti on, which improves the quality of products and enhances the focus on the customers, creati ng markets in previously inaccessible places. Similarly, sharing data and study results across c ountries and regions, aided by advancements in digital technology, can accelerate the elimina tion and eradication of global diseases and contribute to new solutions and health impr ovements. In November 2016, a Chinese group became the first to inject a person with cel ls that contained edited genes using the groundbreaking CRISPR-Cas9 technique (Cyran oski, 2016). This novel technology has the potential to revolutionize the treatment of diffe rent types of cancers, and competition between countries is expected to further fuel pr ogress, similar to the race to the moon. The United States is likely to benefit from such innovations that a ddress pressing health challenges, beyond the race to master gene editing. Average body mass index and rates of homicide and child and maternal mortality are higher in the United States. than any other high- income country (Kontis et al., 2017 ). Moreover, life expectancy for Americans is projected to stagnate in coming years. There ar e opportunities to learn from othe r countries in order to reverse these trends; global health actors often solve problems in resource-constrained environments, so the solutions are locally appropriate and fiscally sustainable. The concept of \"frugal innovation\" has recently been embraced by many business leader s as they expand globally, and see resource constraints as an opportunity instead of a liability , resulting in attempts to embed frugality into the company's fundamental structure (Radj ou and Prabhu, 2014). This new way of thinking could provide many opportunities fo r applying global health lessons to challenges faced in the United States. For example, the mobile phone-based service m-Pesa has solved the problem of limited bank account access to help Kenyans make payments through mobile phones (CBS News, 2015), which has seen extraordinary use and success since its creation. The concept has recently been specifically applie d in a health context through a new program called M-Tiba that helps customers set aside money for health care needs, similar to how a health savings account works (PharmAccess Foundation, 2015). This coul d be adapted to certain health payment contexts in the United States to make health care payments more user-friendly. On a broader scale, the organization Global to Local, founded in 2010 in King County, Washington, identifies strategies that have be en proven effective in other countries and applies them to some of King County's most diverse, underserved populations (G2L, 2013). Additionally, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation created a grant program in 2015 th at funds organizations to gather evidence from other countries to improve community par ticipation and decision making in local health systems, and then bring and adapt these findi ngs to United States (RWJF, 2015). Globalization presents the United States with many opportunities to be at the forefront of global health, with an eye for bidirectional informati on flow and lessons learned.

All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States 2-8 GLOBAL HEALTH AND THE FUTURE ROLE OF THE UNITED STATES PREPUBLICATION DRAFT: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Sustainable Development Goals Improvements in health outcomes cannot be ach ieved by the health sector alone. This is one of the key lessons learned th rough the past decade of global health efforts and progress, including the recent outbreaks of Ebola and Zi ka. Health is the common denominator woven through sectors such as energy, transpor tation, and agriculture , and only through a multidisciplinary \"health in all policies\" approach can there be sustainable progress toward global health goals. Reflecting th e interdependence of sectors a nd the implications for future development, the SDGs were put forward on Ja nuary 1, 2016, to supersede the MDGs ending in 2015 as a nonbinding international agreement to ha rmonize the three interconnected elements of economic growth, social inclusi on, and environmental protection needed to promote sustainable development (UN, 2016). While the SDGs built on the MDGs created in 2000, this new era of international cooperation shifts the vision and goals beyond those simply focused on health, and toward improving the environment, energy, economic growth, and social justice. With 17 goals and 169 targets, the Sustainabl e Development Agenda is too large for any one entity to successfully address and requires a multisectoral effort. To ensure success, government bodies along with financial institutions , capital markets, and private companies, will need to be engaged in bringing the Sustainabl e Development Agenda to fruition. Blending funds from donor organizations, governments, and private debt and equity offers the best chance for achieving these lofty and critical developm ent goals (Nathan, 2017). Moreover, disruptive innovation and new methods of engagement and i nvestment will be necessary to deliver on the development agenda. But a framework for operati ons is lacking; although the global economy is predicted to grow to almost $100 trillion by 2021, th e delivery system of goods and services is outdated and it is coming up short both in terms of protecting the planet and protecting positive social outcomes for those in need (Kharas and McArthur, 2017). Considering these factors, and the positive and negative health effects of increasing globalization, the United States must base its efforts on multidisciplinary collaboration and implementation to continue to be a leader in global health for the next decade. LOOKING TO THE FUTURE: HOW TO BETTER INVEST U.S. FUNDS The United States has an opportunity to th ink more creatively about the methods and mechanisms used to finance global health effort s, particularly as grea ter emphasis is placed on leveraging funding from other gove rnments and increasing engageme nt of private financing. A number of approaches can be considered for optimizing limited U.S. government resources to achieve the global health goals, thereby ensuring a safe homela nd and a strong trade network. In 2014, the Organisation for Economic Co-operati on and Development (OECD) Development Assistance Committee reported th at 17 percent of U.S. fore ign aid was provided through multilateral institutions, while 83 percent was pr ovided bilaterally (Nelson, 2015). While this trend is similar to the global allocation of resources, some do nor governments conversely prefer multilateral channels. For example Sweden directed an average of 60 percent of its development assistance for health towards multilateral cha nnels between 2010 and 2015 (Yamey et al., 2016). Congress will continually be faced with the question of whether to provide aid bilaterally or multilaterally, and although each option has its advantages and disadvantages, the global transitions underway should inform this decisi on. Bilateral aid gives donors more control over how their money is spent, and it allows donor countries to align development assistance with broader strategic foreign policy objectives. C onversely, multilateral channels can sometimes Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

World Bank aid fi gures include both conce ssional and nonconcessional commitments by the International Development Association and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development SOURCES: Birdsall, 2015, and Ce nter for Global Development (CGD), using data from the International Monetary Fund and the Developmen t Assistance Committee of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Similarly, the World Bank and other mu ltilateral development banks (MDBs) have typically only participated in global health in an ad hoc fash ion, through provision of emergency financing during various crises in recent years. Yet, they are also uniquely positioned to meet current demands for global public goods, and through a shift in purpose, MDBs could expand their missions to encompass leadership on these issu es that require a global shareholder base to respond collectively (Birdsall and Morris, 2016). In fact, a high level panel on the future of multilateral development banking recommended th at the World Bank promote global public goods critical to development as its major priority. This woul d be achieved through the creation of a new fund with a separate governance structur e set up to disburse $10 billion annually in grant resources towards programs that cannot be eas ily structured as country operations (Birdsall and Morris, 2016). Thus, there are important roles for different actors, and through an overarching examination, donor countries, reci pient governments, regional MDBs, and the World Bank can identify strengths and weaknesses of different approaches. In addition to directing funding towards multilateral channels, donor governments can help countries increase domestic financing, or domestic resource mobilization (DRM). These methodological considerations will be important to examine as the next administration reviews the current U.S. commitment toward unfished ag endas such as communicable diseases including HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria, and long term investments in maternal and child health. Domestic Resource Mobilization Recent growth projections from the Internati onal Monetary Fund show an increase of 3.5 percent globally in 2017, slightly lower than previous estim ates but still showing a recovery trend worldwide. Emerging market and devel oping economies are estimated to be slightly higher, with 4.6 percent growth in 2017 (IMF, 2016). This gro ss domestic product (GDP) growth is expected to continue in coming years, whic h will provide further support for greater DRM. Coupled with the use of sound fiscal policies, GDP growth will result in a large portion of countries graduating from DAH and beginning to fund health n eeds through their own domestic resources (Bhatt et al., 2015). Moreover, with th e conclusion of the MDGs and creation of the SDGs in 2016, the focus is now broadening from reducing infectious disease and child mortality to the more challenging, cross-disciplinary goals of strengthening health systems and collaboration across sectors. With these tr ends in mind, many donors are working to support recipient governments as they transition health pr ograms from DAH to DRM. This also reflects a shift towards even greater country ownership of their own health priorities and programs, which will inevitably translate into long- term benefits for citizens of reci pient countries as they tailor the programs to their specific needs. However, many low-income and fragile state countries will still depend on traditional sources of humanitari an aid and development assistance to support Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States INVESTING IN GLOBAL HEALTH FOR AMERICA 2-11 PREPUBLICATION DRAFT: UNCORRECTED PROOFS their health programs, and conti nued support of these programs will be critical to ensure their progress is not lost. While this transition to DRM occurs, more DAH can be directed towards the global functions and public goods of gl obal health. Multilateral institu tions, such as The Global Fund and Gavi, are well positioned to deliver great return on investment. Directing more money toward these institutions pools global resources and leverages ec onomies of scale that can be much more responsive to global health needs. Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) may also stand to benefit from increased fund allo cation to multilateral institutions, because such countries cannot independently produce the global public goods that thos e institutions can, such as research and development, knowledge sharin g, market shaping, and management of cross- border externalities (Sch \u00e4ferhoff et al., 2015). Importantly, pu rsuing these elements of global public goods will be advantag eous to all countries. Leveraging the Private Sector In addition to increasing levels of DRM with partner countries, the private sector will be a critical partner in this next stage of global health and deve lopment. An article from the 2017 World Economic Forum annual meeting argued that advancing the cross- sectoral SDGs is a business imperative and transformational change should be undertaken from an ecosystem perspective, explaining \"the longe vity of companies the world over is predicated on the increased access and usage of financial services by those at the bottom of the pyramid\" (Nathan, 2017). The U.S. government has begun to do this in a more strategic manner, through partnerships in other sectors such as Power Africa or Feed the Fu ture within USAID. For example, Power Africa aims to \"crowd-in\" private energy partners in LMICs and, since their inception in 2013, now have over 130 companies involved with a projec ted investment of approximately $40 billion. However, through this partnership and private sector focused model, they ha ve kept direct costs to the agency to only $76 million for FY2016.8 Chapter 8 discusses financing models in more detail, but to emphasize the importance, the co mmittee asks the reader to truly consider throughout the report, how to maximize public, priv ate, and social sect or dollars to spur economic growth and build stronge r communities globally (Nathan, 2017). THE UNITED STATES AS A GLOBAL CITIZEN As many common global health challenges ha ve coalesced over the past decade, including the growing burden of NCDs and poten tially pandemic infecti ous disease outbreaks, several international agreements have been put into effect, committing political efforts and support towards improving health and life for all. As a long-time leader within the global community, the United States is a signatory on thes e agreements, such as th e International Health Regulations (2005), the SDGs, and the Sendai Fr amework for Disaster Risk Reduction. Whether constituted as global action plans, frameworks, goals, or regulations, these agreements further emphasize the need and motivation for the global community to come together to advance the health and wellbeing of each nation's citizens. It should be the continued duty of the United States to both follow and support these global, forward-looking, collaborative efforts. 8 Personal communication with Matt Rees , Power Africa, November 10, 2016.

This point is demonstrated by the Director of National Intelligence's inclusion of the threat of pandemics and other health hazards in the U.S. intelligence community's worldw ide threat assessment every year since 2009,1 including 2016, the most recent year in which that report was available (Clapper, 2016). The U.S. Army recently estimated that if a severe infectious disease pandemic were to occur today, the number of U.S. fatalities could be nearly dou ble the total number of battlefield fatalities sustained in all U.S. wars since the Ameri can Revolution (GAO, 2017). In the last 13 years alone, the world has seen many infectious dise ase outbreaks\u2014such as su dden acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), influenza A virus subtype H1N1, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), Ebola, and Zika virus\u2014 all of which presented serious risks to the health security of countries around the world. Ye t when such public health emergencies occur, funds to combat them are released in a sporad ic and disjointed manner, in amounts far greater than would have been needed fo r prevention and preparedness. In response to the Ebola outbreak in 2014, for example, Congress appropriated $5.4 billion (Kates et al ., 2015), $1.1 billion of which was spent domestically (Epstein et al., 2015), representing 120 percent of the approximately $900 million in total annual appropria tions for building public health and health care preparedness capacity. 2 As of the release of this re port, both MERS-CoV and Zika continue to smolder beneath the surface with small-scale outbreaks, but ther e is no vaccine or treatment available should either erupt into a full-fledged epidemic in a populated area. The poten tial for the use of manmade biological weapons in ac ts of terrorism is an ongoing threat as well. While global crises have largely been avoided to date, the lack of a strategic approach to these threats could have grave consequences. If th e system for responding to such threats remains reactionary, the world will not always be so lucky. Instead, strong public health infrastructure and preparedness systems are needed, along with a clear commit ment from the U.S. government to drug and vaccine development. Yet in the face of compe ting priorities, funding for these purposes is often the first to be cut because of a failure to apprec iate these threats and their potential consequences. Swift and proactive strategic action is needed now, before one or mo re of these threats rise to the surface and outpace the world's ability to respond. 1 Intelligence reports for each year can be found in the archives, located here: https://www.dni.gov/index.php/newsr oom/testimonies/179-congressional-te stimonies-2009 (accessed March 15, 2017). 2 This percentage was calculated by using fiscal year 2016 amounts of Public Health Emergency Preparedness program funding ($660 million) and Hospital Preparedness Program funding ($255 million) as the preparedness amounts.

It th en outlines the human and economic costs of failing to take action to address these security challenges. The third section describes current global health programs and commitments, and why they ar e inadequate to meet these challenges. The chapter then presents the committee's vision of a new approach to global health security, focused on building preparedness capacity in the United States and abroad, ensu ring sustainable funding for these efforts, and creating an environment fo r proactive research and development aimed at enhancing the nation's preparedne ss and response capacity. The fi nal section presents a summary and recommendations. THE GLOBAL HEALTH SECURITY IMPERATIVE The World Health Organization (WHO) defines global health security as the \"activities required . . . to reduce the vulnerability of peopl e around the world to new, acute, or rapidly spreading risks to health , particularly those that threaten to cross internati onal borders\" (CDC, 2016d). To adequately address the risks to global health securit y, however, it is necessary to understand the inherent vulnerabilities encomp assed by this definition. Today's domestic and regional health crises are increasingly influenced by widely interrelated global changes and forces defined by climate change; loss of biodi versity; rapid unsustaina ble urbanization; and scarcities of water, food, and energy (Burkle, 2017). More precise threats include zoonotic spillover or the emergence of new infectious diseases, pandemic influenza, and growing antimicrobial resistance. Exacerbating the risks re sulting from these threats are vulnerabilities such as degraded public health infrastructure, vu lnerable supply chains for health and medical products, and fragile nation states. This section reviews these various threats and vulnerabilities, which are summarized in Table 3-1. TABLE 3-1 Health Threats and Vulnerabilitie s Associated with Globalization Threat Global Impact U.S. Impact Zoonotic diseases and spillover From 2000 to 2010, zoonotic diseases caused $200 billion in indirect economic losses (World Since 1999, West Nile virus (WNV) has infected an estimated 3 million people (Petersen et al., 2013), Bank, 2010). Additionally, more than 2.5 billion cases and 2.7 million deaths can be attributed to the top 56 zoonoses (Gebreyes et al., 2014). resulting in approximately 43,000 illnesses due to its asymptomatic nature (Cahill et al., 2017). Costs of WNV in the United States are estimated to be $56 million per year (Barrett, 2014). Antimicrobial resistanc e (AMR) At the current rate of development of drug resistance, losses of 10 million lives per year and a cumulative loss of $100 trillion in global economic output by 2050 are projected (Review on Antimicrobial Resistance, 2016). In the United States, AMR results in 23,000 deaths and $55-$70 billion in economic losses annually (PCAST, 2014) Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States GLOBAL HEALTH SECURITY IS NATIONAL SECURITY 3-3 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Pandemic influenza A moderately severe influenza pandemica would result annually in 700,000 deaths and a cost of $570 billion (due to income loss and mortality) globally (Fan et al., 2016). An influenza pandemic in the United States would result in 89,000-207,000 deaths and an economic loss of $71.3-166.5 billion (Meltzer et al., 1999). Weak public health infrastructure and protections b The Zika virus, spread by Aedes mosquitoes,c emerged in Brazil in 2014 and spread rapidly to 26 neighboring countries, infecting up to 1 million people (Petersen et al., 2016). Zika's estimated cost to Latin America and the Caribbean was $3.5 billion in 2016 (World Bank, 2016c). Once eradicated from 18 countries in 1962, Aedes aegeypti saw a resurgence due to public health complacency and failed vector control (Whitman, 2016). Aedes aegeypti is found in the southern region of the United States, meaning these states are also at risk for Zika. Mosquito surveillance and control efforts in the United States are implemented in a patchwork manner at the state and county levels (Schmidt, 2016). The urgency of combating Zika led to a $1.88 billion request by President Obama, yet appropriations were delayed by 7 months (Wexler et al., 2016b). Unfortunately, the delay led to more Zika cases, and as of March 1, 2017, 5,074 cases of Zika had been confirmed in the continental United States (CDC, 2017a). Supply chain vulnerabilitie s During the 2014 Ebola outbreak, high demand for personal protective equipment (PPE) was met with low inventory and capacity, and manufacturers struggled to meet the need. As a result, many countries in west Africa had to consider splitting deliveries over time (UNICEF, 2014). A shortage of saline solution, an essential product for U.S. hospitals, occurred in 2014 as a result of recalls from the few U.S. manufacturers and weather issues. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had to begin importing the solution from Germany, Norway, and Spain to alleviate the need (FDA, 2016), as the lack of access to saline can be a death sentence for dialysis patients (Dembosky, 2014). Fragile states/ conflict zones Although Nigeria had been declared polio free in 2015, conflict with Boko Haram in its northern region prevented the establishment of proper surveillance programs, and four types of wild polio viruses were found in 2016. Because polio is highly contagious, public health officials had to initiate a massive campaign to vaccinate millions of children across west and central Africa (Beaubien, 2016). Costs of this campaign have yet to be estimated. The U.S. government is currently the largest donor to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI), with a commitment of $228 million in fiscal year 2016. This funding has contributed to significant gains in reducing polio endemicity (KFF, 2016). However, state fragility is a barrier to polio eradication, and results in a need for continuous U.S. investment due to the ongoing threat. Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

For perspective, seasonal influenza causes 250 -500,000 deaths per year (WHO, 2016c). b Public Health infrastructure is considered to include safe water and sanitation, as well as community preventive programs (e.g., vector control, vaccines). c Aedes mosquitos are widespread throughout the tropics and transmit other arboviruses, such as chikungunya, dengue, and yellow fever. The principal vector for Zika, Aedes aegypti , is widely distributed throughout the Americas (Petersen et al., 2016). Zika has also been found to be spread by mother-to-child transmission, sexual activity, and blood transfusions (Schmidt, 2016). Rapid Urba nization and Loss of Biodiversity: Zoonotic Spillover The trend toward urbanization is accelerating as individuals l eave less prosperous agrarian jobs in rural regions to pursue better opportunities in cities. Wh ile this rural-to-urban migration is not a new phenomenon, it has been accelerated by globaliza tion: in 1950, only 30 percent of people worldwide lived in urban area s, but by 2014, this proportion had risen to 54 percent, and it is expected to grow to 66 pe rcent by 2050 (UN, 2014). The number of megacities (cities with populations of 10 m illion or more), most of which are in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), is also proj ected to grow, from 28 to 41 in the next 15 years (UN, 2014). And as highlighted in the U.S. intelligence communi ty's worldwide threat assessment, Asia and Africa are urbanizing more rapidly than any other regions (Clapper, 2016). While urbanization is an indi cation of economic growth and opportunity, it also reduces biodiversity through habitat loss, fragmenta tion, and biological homogenization (McKinney, 2002; Pauchard et al., 2006). Since 2000, the global community has witnessed numerous outbreaks of diseases such as SARS, Ebola, Marb urg, hantavirus, and avian influenza, as a result of human impacts on biodiversity (COHAB Initiative, 2010). Almost of all of these outbreaks were due to infectious disease spillover, which occurs when an immunologically na\u00efve population comes in contact with a reservoir population that has a high pathogen prevalence. In addition to loss of biodiversity, urbanizati on and high population density can create an environment in which infections such as tubercul osis (TB) can thrive; more virulent strains of evolve (Pongsiri et al., 2009); antimicrobial resist ance occurs (Allen et al., 2010); and the rapid spread of disease becomes possible. While the majority of the disease burden in past outbreaks has fallen on developing countries, increases in human mobility have incr eased the distances and accelerated the speed over which microbes can travel (Labonte et al ., 2011). Thus, despite the global community's efforts to conquer communicable diseases in the poorest regions of the world, it has witnessed the reemergence of known and the emergence of new diseases. SARS is the most notable recent example of the amplification of the spread of disease enabled by today's increased interconnectedness. The first case of SARS was identified in th e Guandong province, China, in November 2002 (CDC, 2013b), and by May 2003, the di sease had spread to 30 countries on 6 continents (WHO, 2017b). Pandemic Influenza A persistent theme of the health security conversation is the thr eat of an influenza pandemic. Unlike seasonal influenza, a pande mic influenza virus results from a dramatic mutation in the virus. In the 20th century, th ree major influenza pandemics occurred\u2014in 1918, 1957, and 1968\u2014causing millions of deaths a nd wide-scale economic disruption. The 1918 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States GLOBAL HEALTH SECURITY IS NATIONAL SECURITY 3-5 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS pandem ic alone resulted in approximately 50-10 0 million deaths (3-5 percent of the global population at the time) (Jeffery and David, 2006), and is cited as the most devastating epidemic in recorded history (see Annex 3-1 at the end of this chapter). However, even less severe pandemics could pose a threat to the global community, as evidenced by the two multicountry influenza pandemics that have occurred since 2000 (the 2005 H5N1 pandemic and the 2009 H1N1 pandemic). The 2009 H1N1 pandemic resulted in approximately 284,000 deaths worldwide (Viboud and Simonsen, 2012). The fre quency with which influenza pandemics have occurred in the past suggests that an influenza pandemic is likely to occu r again (see Box 3-1 for a description of China's current H7N9 outbreak). Regardless of severity, the scale of morbidity and mortality for any influenza outbreak is unpredictable. Thus any potential outbreak pos es a continued national security threat and necessitates a strong public he alth approach (including im munization infrastructure and surveillance) in addition to continued research into vaccines and other medical tools that can mitigate their impacts from the outset. Yet progress on a universal influenza vaccine has been a hope for years (Influenza: Perspective on curr ent season and update on preparedness, 2013; Vergano and Szabo, 2011), and it is increasingly di fficult to maintain private-sector interest in the development of annual season al influenza vaccines (Ridley et al., 2016), as well as to foster high vaccination rates. For example, only 10 states vaccinated at least half of their population against the seasonal flu during the 2015-2016 flu seas on (Segal et al., 2016) . Yet even as robust seasonal flu vaccination remains out of reach, dir ect medical costs of seasonal flu for the U.S. population are estimated at $10.4 billion annually, with projected annual lost earnings estimated even higher at $16.3 billion (M olinari et al., 2007). BOX 3-1 Case Study: H7N9 Outbreak in China First detected in 2013, a new wave of H7N9 infections began in October 2016 in provinces of China, signaling a surge exceeding that of previous years, with 555 cases and 179 deaths reported as of March 31, 2017. While the disease in birds had previously been a low-pathogenic strain, making it difficult to detect sick birds, China's agriculture ministry has said that a highly pathogenic form of the virus has been detected at live-bird markets in Guangdong province for the first time. In addition, a virus sample that could be resistant to Tamiflu has been identified. Among the most recent surge of 304 patients, 144 (or 47 percent) had been exposed to poultry or live-poultry markets, but 11 had experienced no clear exposure, and investigations are still in progress to understand transmission routes for those cases. While WHO still believes common exposure to poultry is likely, human-to-human transmission in certain clusters has not been ruled out. Since 2013, there have been a total of 1,222 laboratory-confirmed cases of H7N9. SOURCES: Schnirring, 2017a,b. Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

AMR is usually attributed to overuse a nd inappropriate use of antimicrobi al drugs, in addition to the growing issue of substandard or counterfeit drugs (Kelesidis et al., 2007). Regardless of its cause, resistance inevitably arises when pathogens become exposed to the drugs used against them. This means that use of antibiotics in livest ock feed and agriculture can also contribute to the development of resistance (Littmann and Vi ens, 2015). As resistant microbes are found in people, animals, food, and water, they can spre ad from animal to person and from person to person. Globalization and increase d migration, travel, and trade ha ve substantially increased the risk of AMR around the world, as signified by the fact that resistance is found in every country (WHO, 2016a). Multidrug-re sistant tuberculosis, for example, a particularly vexing public health issue, has been seen in South America, Ea stern Europe, and across the African and Asian continents (WHO, 2016b). Likewi se, at the M\u00e9decins sans Fronti\u00e8res hospital in Amman, Jordan, half of all wound infec tions among patients arriving from the war in Iraq and Syria are resistant to antibiotics (MSF, 2014). In the United States, 2 million people experience infections that are resistant to the antimicrobials comm only used to treat them, and 23,000 people die each year as a result of such infections (CDC, 2013a) (see a recent example in Box 3-2). Globally, 700,000 annual deaths are attributed to drug-resi stant infections (Review on Antimicrobial Resistance, 2014). In addition to its human costs, the oc currence of resistance has major economic implications at the community, country, regi onal, and global levels (World Bank, 2016b). For example, AMR not only directly affects health care systems by draining workforce capacity and increasing the costs of hospital stays and second-line drugs (Long et al., 2010), but also compromises the progress achieved in reducing the bur den of critical infectious diseases, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), TB, and malaria (as explored more in Chapter 4). Furthermore, according to The World Bank, failing to contain AMR would jeopardize achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030, as well as reverse the poverty reduction and economic growth attained through the effective use of antimicrobials (World Bank, 2016b). BOX 3-2 Case Study: A \"Nightmare\" Bacterium in Nevada A female patient in her 70s in Washoe County, Nevada, arrived in the United States in early August 2016 after an extended visit to India. She was admitted to an acute care hospital on August 18 with a primary diagnosis of systemic inflammatory response syndrome, likely resulting from an infected ri ght hip seroma likely due to a previous procedure performed outside of the United States. Investigators say the infection was caused by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), a multidrug-resistant organism associated with high mortality. While CRE infections are not new to Nevada or the United States, what was new in this case was that the infection was resistant to all available antimicrobial drugs. Further testing of the resistance mechanism identified the presence of New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM-1), an enzyme that directly breaks down a powerful class of antibiotics and is also highly mobile, meaning that it is transferred easily between bacteria. Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States GLOBAL HEALTH SECURITY IS NATIONAL SECURITY 3-7 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Doctors tried 14 different types of antibiotics to treat the infection, but none were successful. Further testing of the organism showed it was resistant to 26 different antibiotics, including many last-resort options, leaving t he doctors with no treatment possibilities. The patient developed septic shock and died in early September 2016. While NDM-1 CRE infections are rare in the United States, this patient had been in India for 2 years previously and had been hospitalized there multiple times. This was also the case with a Swedish patient in whom NDM-1 was discovered in 2009, who had also been hospitalized in India. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that more than 9,000 health care-associated CRE infections occur each year in the United States, and agency labs have confirmed at least one type of CRE in health care facilities in 44 states. SOURCES: Chen et al., 2017; CIDRAP, 2017. The global health challenge of AMR, lik e m any others emphasized throughout this report, cannot be solved by governments alone; priv ate-sector involvement will be critical to achieving success. In January 2016, the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and diagnostics industries signed a declaration on combating AM R, committing to investing in research and development aimed at meeting public health need s and to improving access to high-quality and new antibiotics for all (IFPMA, 2016). Support from all country governments in creating a sustainable market for the products of these e fforts and in implementing measures to prevent further development of resistance will also be cr ucial. Yet unless the United States can mobilize resources and action to address th is problem internationally as well as domestically, success will not be realized. Having reviewed some of the prio rity emerging global health threats, the section will now continue by articulating underlying vulnera bilities that can exacerbate the threats for the United States. Public Health Infrastructure To prevent threats such as those described in the previous sections, the United States and the global community need to support appropriate public health measures, including access to clean water and sanitation, food safety, and robus t immunizations campaigns. Given that not all health security events can be prevented, however , there is also a need for preparedness and response capacity in the event of an outbreak. Well-built and -maintained public health infras tructure geared toward both prevention and preparedness is the first line of defense against health threats. Furthermore, activities related to prevention, epidemic investig ation, and control require a s ophisticated level of decision making and resource coordination (Burkle, 2006). Yet, nations across the world, including the United States, have failed to invest in the necess ary infrastructure and capacities. By sacrificing prevention and preparedness, nati ons have inevitably compromised the ability of public health systems to respond rapidly to health threats. Th ese globally shared deficiencies became evident during the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak and the 2 003-2004 H5N1 outbreak, and again during the 2014 Ebola outbreak (GHR F Commission, 2016). Over the past decade, public health funding in the United States has remained flat at the federal level, but has been cut at drastic rates at the state and local leve ls (Levi et al., 2015a). During 2012, 48 percent of all local health departments reduced or eliminated services, with immunization, maternal and child health, and emergency prepar edness being the program areas Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States 3-8 GLOBAL HEALTH AND THE FUTURE ROLE OF THE UNITED STATES PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS most affected (Levi et al., 2015a). Similarly, de dicated public health and health care emergency funding has been steadily decreasing during the last decade (see Figure 3-1). FIGURE 3-1 Public health emergency preparedness and hospital preparedness program funding by year, 2005-2016. NOTE: HPP = hospital preparedness program; PHEP = public health emergency preparedness. SOURCES: Boddie et al., 2015; Levi et al., 2015b; Segal et al., 2016. Recent memoranda on health security from the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security to the new administration and Congress stress the importance of building sufficient surge capacity in the U.S. health care system to provide clinical car e during epidemics and catastrophes. The memoranda also emphasize build ing public health infrastructure with the expertise and technology to pr ovide earlier warning of outbr eaks and disasters (Inglesby and Cicero, 2017). While the implementation of such a system can be resource-intensive, it also can reap crucial rewards. Uganda, for example, was able to respond effectively to three outbreaks of Ebola (between 2007 and 2013) and one outbreak of Marburg (in 2014) because of the public health infrastructure it built af ter experiencing an Ebola outbreak in 2000, the largest in global history until 2014 (CDC, 2014, 2016f; GHRF Commissi on, 2016). Likewise, Nigeria was able to respond rapidly to its 2014 Ebola outbreak becaus e of a preexisting polio surveillance structure and emergency operations center, as well as trained field epidemio logists. The country was able to rapidly shift the target of these capabilities from polio to contain the Ebola outbreak in Lagos, a city of 21 million people, to just 19 cases and 7 deaths (WHO, 2014b). To ensure a strong health system, it is esse ntial to continually support key public health programs. Public health suffers from the \"out of sight, out of mind\" phenomenon; consequently, success often goes unnoticed and results in compl acency. When this happens, funding is cut and programs are scaled back, which often results in the resurgence of an infectious disease that was previously under control.

To illustrate Box 3-3 desc ribes the examples of dengue and yellow fever resurgence in Brazil, malaria resurgence in Venezu ela, and polio resurgence in conflict zones. BOX 3-3 Case Studies of Infectious Disease Resurgence Dengue and Yellow Fever resurgence in Brazil: Brazil spent much of the 20th century trying to eradicate the Aedes aegypti mosquito, responsible for carrying dengue fever, yellow fever, and now the Zika virus, understanding that the threat of multiple diseases could thereby be addressed. Brazil declared success in 1958 and again in 1973, but given the regional territory of the mosquito, long-term eradication was not possible without concurrent effort in all of the Americas, and Brazil's success did not last. Mosquito control services were drastically reduced in the 1990s, and in 2002 Brazil suffered the worst outbreaks of dengue fever in its history. Eventually, the Zika virus followed. Furthermore, as the result of a combination of relaxed mosquito control, low immunization rates for yellow fever (only 46 percent in 2015), and other factors, Brazil saw a resurgence of yellow fever in February 2017, which has become one of the worst outbreaks the country has seen since the 1940s. Many are now concerned that the outbreak could spread to cities and become an urban phenomenon, possibly spreading to other countries in the region. Malaria resurgence in Venezuela: In 1961, Venezuela was certified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as having eliminated malaria, 9 years ahead of the United States. However, economic turmoil in Venezuela led to a resurgence of the disease not just in remote wooded areas but across the entire nation. Because of this economic turmoil, people resorted to working at gold mines (where mosquitos and malaria thrive) and then returned to urban areas after being infected. This pattern was compounded by shortages of medicines and cessation of preventive interventions, such as spraying, in the cities, allowing malaria to be passed from infected individuals to others. While this represents a daunting problem for Venezuela, it also poses a threat to neighboring countries. Polio resurgence: WHO launched the Global Polio Eradication Initiative in 1988, with the goal of achieving eradication by 2000. By 2003, most of the 126 polio-endemic countries (the exceptions being Afghanistan, Egypt, India, Niger, Nigeria, and Pakistan) had been able to eradicate the disease. Sadly, the breakdown of interventions in Nigeria resulted in the resurgence of polio there, which eventually spread to 21 other countries, 13 of which were reinfected after previous elimination of the disease. Continued spread was eventually contained because of immunization efforts. Now, polio remains endemic in only three countries: Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan. While polio eradication is still technically feasible, budgetary constraints and fatigue can endanger success. Most important, efforts in these three countries are threatened by conflict.

For everyday needs, the me dical and public health sectors have come to rely on a just-in-time delivery system. Less a deliv ery system than an inve ntory strategy, such a system aims to supply a small amount of products as needed. The resul ting limited stockpiles of medical products are the most notable aspect of th is vulnerability, and the supply chains for these stockpiles only contribute to the problem. The United States, for example, currently imports 75- 80 percent of the raw materials for drugs meant for the U.S. domestic market (GAO, 2007), which increases susceptibility to the effects of a public health emergency should an outbreak occur in an exporting country. S upply chain issues are not limited to raw materials, but also apply to widely used medications themselves. A 2009 study, for example, found that 100 percent of 30 identified essential generic life-saving medicines 3 were manufactured overseas\u2014mainly in India or China\u2014with long supply chains and no significant stockpiles. In the event of a pandemic in these countries or a disruption at any point along these supply chains, U.S. hospitals would lose the ability to provide these drugs to patients (Osterholm and Olshaker, 2017). Similarly, according to a 2016 re port by the Trust for America's Health (TFAH), 40 percent of states lack back-up medical supp lies to cope with a pandemic in fluenza or other major outbreak should their supplies be low (Segal et al., 2016). Because of the just-in-time delivery system, many health care systems can be one local suppl y breakdown away from an emergency for their patients. Box 3-4 provides examples of the eff ects of these limitations in supply chains during previous public health emergencies. BOX 3-4 Examples of Stockpile Shortages and Supply Chain Breakdowns 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak: Nurses in Canada experienced shortages of N95 masks, most of which had been shipped to Asia. As the main manufacturers of the masks (3M and Kimb erly-Clark) lacked existing stockpiles, nurses instead had to use less-protective masks. 2014 Ebola outbreak and personal protective equipment (PPE): The need for highly robust PPE, the thousands of cases, and high levels of panic as every hospital tried to prepare for incoming patients caused the demand for adequate PPE to outpace the supply. While Dupont, Kimberly-Clark, and 3M increased their production in an effort to keep pace with the demand, the capacity to meet the need was lacking. Furthermore, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention spent $2.7 million on PPE supplies for the United States, even though there were only a handful of cases in the country, exacerbating shortages for those fighting the outbreak in West Africa. Hinshaw and Bunge, 2014; Northam, 2014; Wysocki and Lueck, 2006. 3 The list of 30 drugs was based on responses from hospital pharmacists about what drugs were absolutely needed in their specialty. These included insulin, heparin, nitroglycerine, albuterol, and various other drugs and antibiotics (Osterholm and Olshaker, 2017). Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States GLOBAL HEALTH SECURITY IS NATIONAL SECURITY 3-11 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS As evidenced by the examples in Box 3-4, the su pply chain systems currently in place are not always capable of meeting a surge in dema nd. Because ensuring surge capacity and adequate stockpiles will likely result in financial losses for manufacturers, governments must incentivize them to do so. For example, Canada purchas es flu vaccines from manufacturers annually\u201410.4 million in 2013 (The Canadian Press, 2014)\u2014to ensure the production of a reserve supply (Public Health Agency of Canada, 2017). The U.S. Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response has begun to take similar action through its partnership with the Centers for Innovation in Advanced Development and Manufacturing, focused on assisting in addressing the shift in vaccine production capabilities overseas by the biopharmaceutical industry (see Chapter 7). However, this vaccine in itiative addresses just on e part of the problem; and additional solutions are needed even for su ch items as saline, gloves, masks, and other routine health supplies. Fragile States Threatening Global Successes Despite the political and public health progress achieved in many countries, the governments of some LMICs have become so ine ffective that these countries are considered failed states. Violence and war threaten the stabil ity of their region and the world, including the progress of global health successe s such as immunization and infectious disease control. The 2017 World Economic Forum Annual Risks Report identifies involuntary large-scale migration as the second most likely global ri sk of concern. The nature of this risk has been demonstrated in Syria, where conflict has driven migration to neighboring countries, transferring pressures to already weakened economies, fueling radicali zation and violence, and demonstrating the consequences of ignoring such challenges (WEF, 2017). Of particular relevance in the present cont ext, the occurrence of conflict and war often results in the destruction of a health system a nd its public health interventions, creating an ideal environment for diseases to spread unchecked (Michelle et al., 2007). 4 Prior to the current civil war in Syria, for example, its vaccination rates were among the highest in the Mediterranean region\u2014at above 90 percent (Alw an, 2015). In 2014, however, polio, measles, and pertussis resurged in Syria and spread to Iraq, threaten ing public health in both countries. When such resurgence occurs, it can require drastic responses, since as long as cases exist anywhere in the world, such diseases will constantly be a th reat to everyone. Even those who have been vaccinated are at risk given the need for herd immunity for vaccinations to be fully effective (Fine et al., 2011). As another example, as a result of recent conflict and war in Yemen, that country launched a major polio vaccination campai gn in February 2017 because of fears that the disease would reappear, even though the country was declared polio-free in 2009. Given the real dangers posed by state fragility and conflicts, the global community has an imperative to take action. However, a response all too often is launched after an emergency has occurred\u2014a pattern that needs to end. According to Frederick Burkle of the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative, 4 Regions of the world that have been particularly affect ed by conflict in recent years ar e the Lake Chad region in Africa and the WHO Mediterranean Region. Conflict caused by Boko Haram near Lake Chad has raised concerns by officials about polio resurgence. Countries in the WHO Mediterranean Region, which consists of the Middle East and North Africa, have been struck by conflict and wars, but most of thos e affected are inaccessible to aid and medical supplies, but a hotbed of disease resurgence (Alwan, 2015).

(Burkle, 2017, p.2) U.S. leadership plays an important role in s upporting healthy societies abroad. However, the effects of state fragility on security and pr ogress in global health warrant early and swift intervention. The costs of failing to support global health, especi ally in terms of basic public health protections, can be high. Finding: Wide-ranging threats to global health security in fluenced by resource scarcity, rapid urbanization, and inadequaci es in stewardship of medications are poised to exploit the vulnera bility of all countries, including the United States. These threats range from infectious diseas e spillover to pandemic influenza, to antimicrobial resistance, and are exacerba ted by such vulnerabilities as degrading public health infrastructure, weak medical supply chains, and fragile states. THE COSTS OF INACTION Failure to act to address the threats and vul nerabilities detailed above has severe human and economic costs, many of which have been demonstrated throughout previous outbreaks and emergencies. Human Costs Since 2009, the world has witnessed multiple re gional and global outbreaks of diseases whose effects could have been mitigated had better prevention and preparedness measures been in place. Following the H1N1 outbreak in 2009, CDC led an internationa l research team that examined the global death toll from the pa ndemic; the team's estimate was 284,000 deaths worldwide due to H1N1 directly. In addition, the virus indirectly caused 201,200 respiratory deaths and another 83,300 deaths due to car diovascular disease (Roos, 2012). In another example, as of April 2016, 11,325 people had died in the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa (CDC, 2016a), and if the outbreak had unfolded in any nearby megacity, the death toll would have been far higher. Moreover, an additional 10,623 people were estimated to have died from other causes in the three Ebola- affected countries during the outb reak, simply as a result of the chaos and reduced availability of services (Parpia et al., 2016). This latter figure represents an almost 100 percent increase in deaths that occurred simply because the health system had to halt or reduce all other services to focus its attenti on on Ebola, reversing progress on many diseases and health issues because of the lack of surge ca pacity. Looking to future threats, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research, even a moderately severe influenza pandemic could lead to 2 million or more excess de aths worldwide (Fan et al., 2016). Economic Costs Past outbreaks have illustrated that the ec onomic losses they cause can far exceed the costs of preventing them. For example, the erad ication of smallpox worldwide led to benefits Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

The costs of infectious disease outbreaks are likely to rise, m oreover, as such outbreaks become more fr equent as a result of expanding travel and trade, as well as environmental changes (P ike et al., 2014). The costs are only partially attributable to treating and contro lling the disease itself; additional costs result from panic and the \"worried well\" flooding hos pitals and stripping pharmacies of medical supplies. Indeed, panic can have more of a negati ve effect on an economy than an outbreak itself, as evidenced by the discourse in the United States during the Ebola outbreak. Once an Ebola patient had been diagnosed in the United Stat es and $5.4 billion in response funds had been allocated, $1.1 billion was spent on domestic resp onse, including public health studies, state and local laboratory capacity, state and local preparedness, and domestic migration activities (Epstein et al., 2015). Of this amount, $119 million was spent just on domestic quarantine activities, including screening at five ma jor U.S. airports, medical cons ultations, investigations of potentially sick travelers, and follow-up (C DC, 2015a). And while commendable efforts were made by thousands of federal, state, and loca l government workers (White House, 2015), it is important to keep in mind that this domestic ally-focused $1.1 billion was disbursed in response to only four cases nationwide.5 The amount spent likely would have increased greatly if the number of cases had risen even to 10 or 20. Following the SARS outbreak in 2003, which last ed less than 1 year, global costs of the pandemic were assessed to be $40-$54 billion (Jonas, 2014a; McKibbin, 2004). According to a World Bank policy research paper, the four most affected economies in East Asia (China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Singapore) experienced estimat ed gross domestic product (GDP) losses of $13 billion (Brahmbhatt and Dutta, 2008). Similarly, Guinea, Liberia, and Si erra Leone together were projected to suffer a crippling loss in fore gone economic growth in 2015 as a result of the Ebola epidemic. After positive GDP growth in 2013 in all three countries, 2014 saw Guinea's GDP growth drop from 4 percent to 0.1 percent and Li beria's from 8.7 percent to 0.7 percent, while Sierra Leone's GDP growth declined from 4.6 percent in 2014 to -21.5 percent in 2015 (World Bank, 2016a). Many of these economic lo sses could have been prevented had a more resilient health system capable of preventing and dete cting outbreaks been in place (World Bank, 2015). In addition to determining the cost of past out breaks, it is important to examine models of future outbreaks to better inform policy and pl anning. The projected economic impact of an influenza pandemic ranges from $570 billion per year , including the intrinsic value of lives lost prematurely and illness suffered (Fan et al., 2016), 6 to $2 trillion7 in direct costs, worker absenteeism, and disruptions in business (Burns et al., 2008). The Bottom Line Infectious disease outbreaks clearly impose te rrible costs in terms of human suffering and mortality, as well as economic costs that threat en progress and stabilit y in countries around the 5 This number does not include cases of patients who became sick while working in West Africa and returned to the United States for treatment. 6 This study, conducted by the National Bureau of Economi c Research, estimated the effe ct of a moderately severe pandemic (one with a mortality rate of less than 10 SMUs, where 1 SMU corresponds to 735,000 deaths). The costs include expected income losses and th e intrinsic value of lives lost and illness suffered (Fan et al., 2016). 7This study, conducted by the World Bank, estimated the cost of a moderate influenza pandemic (one that would reduce global output by more than 2 percent). The cost s included are direct costs, worker absenteeism, and disruptions in business (Burns et al., 2008). Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Given the human and economic to ll repeated time and again, the question then arises of how many more such outbreaks must occur before the global community acknowledges this as a threat that warrants taking sustainable action and musters the collective will to do so. Finding: The committee believes that these threats will only become more prevalent, due to global changes such as urbanization, resource scarcity, population growth, and environmental ch anges, resulting in high human and economic costs. THE CURRENT GLOBAL COMMITMENT Even as increasing globalization is making the world ever more vulnerable to infectious disease outbreaks\u2014whether due to natural, accidental, or intentional causes\u2014thereby threatening national and global security, methods of distributing global aid are changing. While U.S. development policy has remained focused on U.S. aid as a way to build prosperous nations, it has become increasingly clear that, to achieve be tter health for their peop le, recipient countries no longer want to be considered be neficiaries of bilatera l aid, but rather part ners in multilateral groups (Birdsall and Leo, 2016). Given that no si ngle nation can be protec ted if other nations remain unprepared to count er biological threats, 8 the United States has a unique opportunity to capitalize on this shift in the nature of desired re lations. It should move to encourage partnerships and cross-sector coordination focused on achieving the shared goal of security from infectious disease threats for all people. To fully understand the importance of this commitment, one must first know the history that contribut ed to the need for such investment of U.S. resources abroad. The International Health Regulations The International Health Regulations (IHRs), which replaced the International Sanitary Regulations in 1969, were updated in 2005 following the global SARS outbreak to reflect the rapid expansion of international trade and touris m. While WHO had developed the vision for this update in the late 1990s, the 2003 SARS pandemic brought increased attention to the need to shift from halting diseases at national borders to finding and halt ing them at their source. This revision helped strengthen capacity and c ooperation in many countries. However, the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, which served as the first true test of the revised IH Rs, revealed continued vulnerabilities in public health capacities at all levels, lim itations in scientific knowledge concerning response, difficulties in decision ma king under uncertain conditions, complexities in international cooperation, challenges in communi cation among experts and with the public, and shortcomings of WHO deci sion making (WHO, 2011). Unfortunately, as of 2014, only about 33 percent of the 196 WHO member countries were in compliance with IHR core capacities (Katz, 2016). Thus, there exists an imperative for robust information sharing, monitoring, and resp onse capacities both in the United States and abroad\u2014where most infectious disease outbreaks originate\u2014to enable pr oper preparation for the next and perhaps more dangerous outbreak. Ma ny experts have recommended working toward an international consensus framework to fulfill th e obligation of Article 44 of the IHRs. Such a 8 Executive Order No. 13747, Advancing the Global Health Security Agenda to Achieve a World Safe and Secure from Infectious Disease Threats, 3 C.F.R. 13747.

The Global Health Security Agenda To ensure that countries around the world would meet IHR core capacity requirements for public health emergencies, the U.S. governme nt, along with international partners, launched the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA) in February 2014. Originally a 2-year, $85 million commitment (Morrison, 2014), support for the GHSA increased as a result of the Ebola outbreak. Now supported by one-time supplemental funding9 (Frieden, 2016) of $1 billion (GHSA, 2017), the GHSA seeks to improve national-level capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease threats, and it has established 11 action packages10 to achieve these goals (CDC, 2016c). Rather than creating a new stra tegy aimed at health security, the GHSA builds on existing U.S. strategies that provide for cap acity building, technical assistan ce, and commodity support. Where the GHSA is novel, however, is in its coordination of these strategies and its elevation of global health security to senior-l evel attention (Holgate, 2014). Building Epidemiological Capacity In line with the GHSA's mandate of building workforce capacity, fostering the development of a cohort of public health expe rts with knowledge of th e salient science and policy can help with early detection of and res ponse to outbreaks. If this capacity building is done in a sustainable manner, a full transfer of U.S., Canadian, and European public health responders will not be necessary whenever an outbreak occurs. During the 2014 Ebola outbreak, the strong public health capacity in Nigeria\u2014encompassing tr ained field epidemiologists and an active and functioning emergency operations cent er (previously supporting polio surveillance)\u2014 managed to successfully monito r 900 people through deployment of the country's established team of field epidemiologists while also enga ging community leaders and members (Courage, 2014; Frieden, 2014). The Field Epidemiology and Tr aining Program (FETP) develops expertise in detecting diseases locally and preventing them from spreading globally. The program has trained more than 3,100 epidemiologists in mo re than 70 countries since 1980 (CDC, 2016e), and has been based in Nigeria since 2008. In 2013-2014 alone, African FETP graduates responded to more than 100 outbrea ks, including Lassa fever in Ni geria, polio in Cameroon and Nigeria, and monkeypox in The Democratic Repu blic of the Congo (CDC, 2015b). This program is also supported by the GHSA, which, through its action package on workforce development, saw the establishment, expansion, or participation of 17 countries in FETP programs to increase the number of disease detectives (GHSA, 2017) (see Box 3-5). Continued support of 9 The GHSA is partially fund ed by leftover Ebola emergency funds in the fiscal year (FY) 2015 Omnibus Package (Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015, Public Law No. 113-235, Title VI, 113th Congress), which became redirected but expire in FY2019 (Segal et al., 2016). 10 The GHSA's Action Packages are cat egorized into three domains: Preven t, Detect, and Respond. Under the Prevent Domain are the Action Packages for Antimicr obial Resistance, Zoonotic Disease, Biosafety and Biosecurity, and Immunization. Under th e Detect Domain are the Action Packag es for National Labo ratory Systems, Real Time Surveillance, International Reporting, and Wo rkforce Development. Under the Response Domain are the Action Packages for Emergency Operation Centers, Multisector Rapid Response, and Medical Countermeasures/Personnel Deployment (CDC, 2016c).

BOX 3-5 Country Examples of Field Epidemiology Training Program (FETP) Deployment Since the Launch of the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA) Pakistan: Outbreaks of such childhood diseases as measles, diphtheria, and pertussis can be prevented with vaccines but remain common in parts of Pakistan. When outbreaks occur, they are particularly dangerous to children. Between January and March 2016, Pakistan's Field Epidemiology Training Program graduates responded to four distinct outbreaks of vaccine- preventable diseases across five provinces. Disease detectives investigated the reasons for low vaccination coverage and initiated a campaign that provided vaccinations and health awareness sessions, helping to contain the outbreaks and protect thousands of people, including children. Uganda: The United States has been strengthening Uganda's public health laboratory and surveillance systems; training disease detectives; and supporting Uganda's Public Health Emergency Operations Center (PHEOC), first established in 2013 for outbreak preparedness and response. In March 2016, the quick activation of the PHEOC, enhanced laboratory and diagnostic capacities, and disease detectives from the FETP helped the Ministry of Health contain a yellow fever outbreak and rapidly establish a surveillance and specimen referral system to identify potential new cases. The response efforts were substantially improved relative to the 2010 yellow fever outbreak, when it took more than 40 days just to diagnose the disease correctly. SOURCE: GHSA, 2017. Concerns for the Future of the GHSA The GHSA i s financed by one-time suppl emental funding, which will run out by 2017 (Frieden, 2016), and there is concern about what will happen thereafter. In surveys administered to CDC country directors and comments made by high-ranking government officials (GU GHSS and HGI, 2017), strong support for the continuati on of the GHSA has been expressed. Although an executive order signed by President Ob ama in November 2016 called for the GHSA's advancement and established long-term policy obj ectives for the United States to build on its achievements (Rice, 2016), there is no guarantee as to its future direction. Global health security requires stable s upport systems for preparedness and response capacity in LMICs. Sustained funding by the glob al community is impera tive to support this capacity and prevent the reversal of the progr ess that has been achieved. Following the west Africa Ebola outbreak, multiple high-level panels and commissions were charged with identifying needed WHO reforms (described furthe r in Chapter 9). These groups also highlighted the need for countries to partner with WHO to ensure that they can implement the core capacities necessary to comply with th e IHRs, with the goal of having every government develop and publish concrete plans by 2020 (Gostin et al., 2016). Meeting this need wi ll require continued Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

The GHSA is a valuable initiative that has been able not only to coordinate the vast array of U.S. programs in global health security but also to create transparent and mutually accountable means for countries around the world to assess their own capacities. While it is hoped that capacity-buildi ng efforts will eventually be assumed by national governments, until then, the umbrella of programs supported by the GHSA and the focus of global health security itself requires continuous funding. Absent this concerted effort to ensure the development of resilient he alth systems in LMICs, capable of preventing and responding to emergencies, the risk of another Ebola-like epidem ic remains a very real threat to all countries around the world. Efforts to Combat Antimicrobial Resistance In 2014, recognizing the growing threat of AMR and its national and global implications, President Obama signed an executive order on co mbating antibiotic-resistance bacteria (Obama, 2014). This executive order formed the basis of the National Strategy for Combating Antibiotic- Resistant Bacteria (White House, 2014b) and esta blished a federal interagency task force for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria.11 Among its functions, the task force was asked to submit a 5-year National Action Plan incorpor ating the recommendations of the report on combating antibiotic resistance of the Pres ident's Council of Advi sors on Science and Technology (PCAST) (PCAST, 2014). In addition, the task force co -chairs were charged with establishing the Presid ential Advisory Council on Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria (PACCARB) to provide advice and guidance for their work. While the PACCARB acknowledged that important steps have been taken to achieve the milestones outlined in the National Action Plan, its initial assessment identified overarching issues and generated recommendations for further improvement. Goal 5 of the plan\u2014\"Improve international collaboration and capacities for antibiotic-resistance prevention, surveillance, control, and antibiotic research and devel opment\"\u2014has particular relevance to global partnerships, (PACCARB, 2016) and PACCAR B therefore made recommendations for improving international collaboration and capacity that include Improving measures of effectiveness by identifying outcome indicators, ensuring resources commensurat e with supporting the goals, expanding the number of countries involved, leveraging the expertise of nongovernme ntal organization (NGO) assets, broadening the scope of One Health, and expanding engagement around research and development. Up to 30 percent of drugs sold in LMICs have been found to be counterfeit, an issue that represents a significant risk for the development of AMR (Cockburn et al., 2005). The U.S. government has made efforts to stem the flow of substandard and counterfeit pharmaceuticals by 11 The task force is co-chaired by the secretaries of defe nse, agriculture, and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and made up of representatives fr om the U.S. Departments of State, Justice, Veterans Affairs, and Homeland Security, as well as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Agency for International Development, the Office of Management and Budget, the Domestic Policy Council, the National Security Council, the Office of Science and Technology Policy, and the National Science Foundation.

The U.S. Agency for International Development (USA ID) has entered into a number of partnerships in hopes of reducing the number and availabil ity of counterfeit drugs. Perhaps th e most important of these is with the U.S. Pharmacopeial Convention\u2014the Promoting the Quality of Medicines Program. This program operates in 28 countries and has b een able to assist 17 countries with quality monitoring and surveillance (USP, 2017a,b). Buildi ng on such partnerships could help combat the significant threat to the supply chain of pharmaceuticals posed by counterfeit drugs. Additionally, embracing the One Health appro ach across sectors can help not only in optimizing the use of resources but also in impr oving the effectiveness of interventions aimed at promoting health in humans, animals, and the en vironment. The One Health approach recognizes that human health is closely related to the health of the environment and of animals. Given that 6 of every 10 infectious diseases in humans are spread from animals, the One Health approach aims to encourage collaborative efforts of multiple disciplines working locally, nationally, and globally to achieve the best health for people, animals, and the environment (CDC, 2017b). This approach is implemented in gl obal activities such as the GHSA and the use of animal-human interface officers at CDC's Global Disease Detecti on sites (CDC, 2016b). While there has been progress toward Goal 5 of the National Action Plan, there remain challenges that hinder its full realization, including difficulties in providing incentives for the development of diagnostics and therapeutics. Howeve r, a particularly critic al barrier is the lack of sufficient funds to advance the AMR age nda. Although Congress appropriated $1 billion in FY2016 for combating AMR, the overwhelming ma jority of that funding was earmarked for domestic spending, with approximately $835 million being allocated to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) (Cabezas, 2016). U.S. hospitals certainly deserve and demand high levels of proper stewardship and infection control, but unless preparedness and surveillance capacities are built and sustained in ternationally, AMR will continue to threaten U.S. citizens regardless of how prepared U. S. hospitals may be. The example presented previously in Box 3-2 highlights how rapidly ba cterial pathogens can spread and how important it is to invest in these capacities globally. World leaders committed to uniting in the fight against AMR at a high-level meeting on AMR held at the United Nations (UN) in Se ptember 2016, only the fourth time that the UN General Assembly has met to discuss a health issue. This high level of political commitment provides a unique opportunity to develop and implement a coordinated global strategy for addressing the problem (UN, 2016). The committ ee concurs with the initial assessment of PACCARB and underscores the critical need to accelerate this work to ensure that milestones and deliverables of the National Action Plan are realized. Annex 3-2 provides additional detail on efforts to combat AMR and the National Action Plan. Finding: The growing threat of antimicr obial resistance resu lting from poor stewardship, weak surveillance systems, and a lack of potential new therapeutics will be a major threat to the entire global community\u2014in terms of both lives lost and impacts on the global economy\u2014in the next 10 years.

By virtue of their unpredictability and global effect, infectious di seases remain a perpetual challenge for the global community (Fauci and Morens, 2012). Since 1997, each U.S. pr esidential administration has been faced with an emerging or reemerging infectious disease that assumed high political priority, including HIV/AIDS, H5N1 influenza, SA RS, MERS-CoV, Ebola, and Zika (Fauci, 2017). More recently, AMR received high-level attention from the UN as a global crisis (UN, 2016), and, as described earlier in Box 3-1, the largest out break of influenza A (H7N9) to date is currently occurring in China (Iuliano, 2017). Whether the challenge is at tributable to limitations of the design and methods employed or the vision and funding for programs being t oo short-sighted and ad hoc, the United States needs to reorient programs and platforms to truly protect U.S. citizens, at home and abroad, from threats to their health and safety and the corresponding economic consequences. This reorientation needs to fo cus on preparing to prevent and preparing to respond, both of which require strong coordina tion and innovation while building resilience across all sectors. Preparedness and Disaster Risk Reduction The first need is for intentional stewards hip of a true preparedness agenda. Building strong public health systems becomes more difficult each year with declining funding. The United States needs to take a more proactive appr oach to being prepared and reducing the risk of public health emergencies. Mitigation Through Building Capacity Parallel to this shift of focus on adequate and forward-looking funding, capacity building and outbreak prevention need to be prioritized. Since the Ebola outbreak, numerous reports have been written that advocate for building country cap acity and creating resilie nt health systems in developing countries to enable better responses in the futu re. Domestically, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) began shif ting its priorities from disaster response to mitigation and prevention, finding that for every do llar it invests in mitiga tion, it saves 4 dollars in response (MMC, 2005). The agency now has begun incorporating in centives into its frameworks and funding for localities that can de monstrate investment in mitigation. This same concept can be applied to investme nts in global health security through a lens of disaster risk reduction (see Box 3-6). Effective strategies fo r comprehensively building resilient health systems in low-resource settings remain elusiv e. However, disaster risk reduction (DRR) can make it possible to address the challenge incremen tally through such goals as increasing health workforce capacity and building resilience. BOX 3-6 Disaster Risk Reduction Disasters often follow natural hazards. A disaster's severity depends on how much Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States 3-20 GLOBAL HEALTH AND THE FUTURE ROLE OF THE UNITED STATES PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS impact a hazard has on society and the environment. The scale of the impact in turn depends on the choices people make for their lives and for the environment. These choices relate to how food is grown, where and how homes are built, what kind of government the nation has, how its financial system works, and even what is taught in schools. Each decision and action either makes people more vulnerable or more resilient to disasters. Disaster risk reduction (DRR) is the concept and practice of reducing disaster risks through systematic efforts to analyze and reduce the causal factors of disasters. Reducing exposure to hazards, lessening the vulnerability of people and property, wisely managing land and the environment, and improving preparedness and early warning for adverse events are all examples of DRR. SOURCE: UNISDR, 2016. The 2015 Sendai Fram ework for Disaster Risk Reduction calls for investing in DRR for resilience through cost-eff ective measures that can save li ves, reduce losses, and enhance economic and social well-being (UNISDR, 2015). Such measures include strengthening the design and implementation of inclusive policies through engagement with the community, such as by improving access to basic health care, food security, housing, and education, with the goal of eradicating poverty (UNISDR, 2015). Also necessary is coherence across systems and cooperation among the academic, scientific, govern mental, and private sectors to promote capacity building. Viewing these e fforts through a lens of DRR can synergize existing programs, create opportunities for partners hip, and lead to greater system s capacity in a country. Through such partnerships as the GHSA, it is more cost-effective to invest in building resilience and preventing outbreaks than to respond once an epidemic is out of control (World Bank, 2012). Supporting this concept, an in ternational commission released a report in 2016 calling for building health system core capacities in devel oping countries and aligning them with the SDGs to better respond to health em ergencies (GHRF Commission, 2016). At Home and Abroad In addition to building capacity at the source of an outbreak, achieving global health security for the United States will require a robus t U.S. infrastructure to detect and respond to biological threats, whether natu rally occurring, accidental, or intentional. Yet, a 2016 report issued by TFAH states that over th e past 15 years, one-third of funds for health security and one- half of funds for health care system prepare dness have been cut. In 2002, for example, health emergency preparedness funding was $940 m illion, and by FY2016 it had decreased to $660 million (Segal et al., 2016)\u2014this despite the constant emergence of threats that the U.S. health infrastructure has often just barely avoided. Similarly, annual funding for health care system preparedness has been reduced to just $255 million nationally, an amount intended to support every hospital in the country in being prepared for disasters. As noted earlier, these preparedness amounts are moderate, yet whenever public health emergency or outbreak occurs, large amounts of funding are directed toward response. Indee d, the money the United States has spent on just five outbreak responses since 2005 exceeds the combined spending on public health and health care preparedness capacity building efforts in that same time period (see Figure 3-2).

NOTE: HPP = Hospital Preparedn ess Program; 2016; BARDA, 2007; Kate 2015; et al., 2015b; Obama, 2009; Segal et al., 2016; White House, 2014a. A report from the Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Bi odefense recommends that public health emergency preparedness cooperative agreements fo r state and local infras tructure be funded to authorized levels or the president's request , whichever is higher (Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense, 2015). Although this recommendati on was implemented through the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016, neither President Ob ama nor Congress returned funding to levels that existed following the 2001 anthrax attack s (Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense, 2016). The committee believes that now more than ever, sustainable and adequate funding is needed to build readiness into public health and health care infrastructure, and that appropriate funding levels for this purpose are those that were in pl ace in the initial years of the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Response Act of 2002. This assessment is supported by those of other experts who call for funding levels to return to FY2006 levels, or roughly $1 billion (Watson et al., 2017). Finding: Funding for preparedness has decr eased dramatically since the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Response Act was enacted in 2002.

A Well-Coordinated Response Although strong and prepared health systems, bot h in the United States and abroad, are of paramount importance for identifying and contai ning the next outbreak, some level of response capability will always be nece ssary. As discussed above, however, the funding needed for response can be reduced by investments in prev ention and preparedness. The direct costs of treating just two Ebola patients in the United St ates at the specialty center in Nebraska, for example, were estimated at more than $1 million (Gold, 2014). If mitigation and prevention efforts can halt an outbreak at the source, before it extends beyond a regi on, these costs are less likely to be incurred. For the United States, the current approach to or ganizing response is inadequate, and a better system for disbursing response funds is long overdue. U.S. Interagency Coordination During the Ebola outbreak, the United States co ntributed key resource s and critical global leadership in a time of crisis. However, many su ggestions have been made since then for how better to execute such a massive response. First, ther e currently exists no response framework to guide agencies during this type of internati onal event (similar to FEMA's domestic National Response Framework); thus, there is no clear lead er for the United States in an international health emergency. Creation of an internati onal response framework would provide a command structure and an awareness of roles and responsibilities for the agencies involved, including the blending of international and domestic responses. The success of a U.S. response is dependent on the strengths of each agency working in paralle l\u2014the logistics of the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD); the policy of HHS; the coordina tion and international authorities of the State Department; the country-level knowledge of USAID and CDC; and the wealth of expertise from the private sector, NGOs, and academia. The Ebola re sponse initially was ch aotic and lacking in coordination until the White House a ppointed a czar to direct it. Although this was a step in the right direction, there were pitfa lls that could have been avoi ded from the beginning. Moreover, simply selecting a czar every time a new out break occurs prevents the development of a longitudinal knowledge base that can be drawn on in future public health emergencies. The 2016 report of the Blue Ribbon Study Pane l on Biodefense also identifies this problem with the overall U.S. strategy, and cal ls for a Biodefense Coordination Council in the office of the vice president (Blue Ribbon Study Pa nel on Biodefense, 2016). As of the release of this report, that recommendation has yet to be implemented. Echoing this need for high-level coordination, other experts have recommended a de dicated leadership pos ition and office to lead health security efforts (Watson and Watson, 2017). Options to this end include creating a department or office in one of the agencies involved in a res ponse or creating an interagency working group. However, challenges arise with resp ect to the politics of such a coordinating role and the authority needed to drive a massive, mu ltifaceted response. USAID's Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) assumes this co ordinating role for the U.S. response during nonhealth emergencies, such as earthquakes and fami nes in other countries, but typically is not activated for health emergencies (although a di saster assistance res ponse team [DART] was deployed during the 2014 West Africa Ebola outbreak) (Gavi, 2014). Expanding the mandate of OFDA and the DART capability could be a mechan ism for the necessary coordination. Yet given Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Finding: Although multiple agencies bring unique expertise to a U.S. government-led response, it is difficult to coordinate an urgent plan during a crisis without strong leadership, a we ll-defined chain of command, and an adequate budget. Sustainable Funding Though preparedness has proven a difficult agenda for which to compel resources, once an emergency does occur, funding, often in large amount s, is directed retroactively to that issue. By this point, most of the damage has already been done, and clinicians, epidemiologists, researchers, and other stakehol ders are scrambling to catch up with the emergency. The nation simply cannot afford to stand by while critical f unds to fight these outbreaks are held back. After 7 months of disagreement and delay in approving President Obam a's request for $1.9 billion in Zika funding, for example, Congress finally approved $1.1 billion with the passage of the Zika Response Appropriations Act of 2016 12 (Wexler et al., 2016a). Until then, agencies were forced to shift funds from other accounts for Zika-related activities, including borrowing from the Ebola supplemental funding and from CDC's state-leve l emergency public health care preparedness account (Epstein and List er, 2016; Kodjak, 2016). Many experts have called for a standing publ ic health emergency fund. The committee agrees with this recommendation; however, it is important to understand that this funding would be reserved for response activit ies only. Multiple respondents fr om the information gathering conducted by the committee (explained in Chapter 1) reported that global budgets for fighting diseases such as TB and malaria can lapse when large-scale outbreaks occur because money is redirected. A lack of secure funding for outbreak response prevents\u2014and, the committee believes, sometimes reverses\u2014progress in othe r global health arenas. Money to address an outbreak once the United States is in response mode is important and necessary, but carving it out of existing pools of funds dedicated to impor tant ongoing health issues would be imprudent, and could even seed the risk for a separa te future outbreak. In a 2016 letter, PCAST recommended that Congress establish a public health emergency response fund13 of at least $2 billion, modeled after the U.S. Disaster Relief Fund for FEMA (PCAST, 2016). FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund is funded annually, and unuse d funds from the previous fiscal year are carried over to the next. The recommended publ ic health emergency response fund would likewise consist of funds that w ould carry over across years and could be replenished by routine and emergency appropriations. Access to the fu nds would be contingent on the express authorization of the President or the joint agr eement of the secretaries of HHS and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) (PCAST, 2016). The committee, along with other 12 Zika Response Appropriations Act, H.R. 5243. 2016. 13According to the PCAST letter, \"There is a Public Health Emergency Fund that was authorized in 1983 and placed at the disposal of HHS, but it has not been replenished since 1993, despite repeated national level infectious disease emergencies. In addition to being moribund, it is specific to HHS and therefore more na rrow than what we propose here. There is also a Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund. This fund is used by the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Respon se to fund some preparedness activities, but it has not been used as a contingency or reserve fund\" (PCAST, 2016).

Finding: When an emergency does occur, funding for response is mired in bureaucratic processes, so that the funds are not available in a timely manner, but are often eventually releas ed in amounts that far outwe igh what is requested to prevent the emergency. Innovation Agenda: Getting Ahead of the Pathogens Budget caps and annual appropriations have challenged global health research and development funding, which in turn can compro mise agencies' ongoing efforts when they are forced to plan the development of critical medical products just 1 year at a time. Additionally, for such diseases as Ebola and Zika and othe r emerging threats, funding for research and development of critical medical products, incl uding vaccines and ther apeutics, is highly reactionary. Unless money is invested up front, researchers and agencies will constantly be scrambling to get ahead of an outbreak, and indust ry will always consider the risks of becoming involved. Like the challenge of an timicrobial resistance, these pr oblems cannot be solved after a threat has emerged. The Public Health Emergency Me dical Countermeasure Enterprise Successfully developing and procuring vaccine s and drugs that are needed during an outbreak will require forward thinking and explor ation of unique solutions that may not be risk- free. To help coordinate the efforts of th e federal government, in 2006 HHS established the Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasur e Enterprise (PHEMCE). Its mission is to coordinate efforts related to medical countermeas ures with all interagency partners. Led by the Office of the Assistant Secretar y for Preparedness and Response, core members include CDC, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the U.S. Department of Veterans Affair s (VA), DoD, DHS, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). The PHEMCE has made mu ch progress since its inception, but because of its focus on preparedness, its scope does not encompass all global health research and development. Thus questions remain around information sharing re lated to rare or noncommunicable diseases (global health research and development is explored further in Chapter 7). Additionally, opportunities remain for improved communication and coordination even within the focus on medical countermeasures. The 2016 letter from PCAST calls in the near term for a new interagency entity charged with planning, coordination, and overs ight of national biodefense activities, including developmen t of a national biodefense strategy (PCAST, 2016). Creation of this entity would further encourag e information sharing related to re search priorities and areas of synergy for agencies involved in the development of medical countermeasures. Leveraging Assets from the U.S. Department of Defense A 2016 analysis led by Duke Global Health Institute found opportunities for using what works well more effectively and identified DoD's medical research capabili ties as having greatly underutilized potential for global health research and developm ent (Yamey et al., 2016). In particular, DoD has both Army and Navy overseas laboratories in key strategic locations that Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States GLOBAL HEALTH SECURITY IS NATIONAL SECURITY 3-25 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS facilitate international research collaboration, lab oratory diagnos tics, and surveillance. Because of their focus on locally relevant diseases and their reliance on locally hired research personnel, these laboratories have become integrated into pu blic health efforts of the host nations, and can be assets in capacity building in those countries (Peake et al., 2011). To realize this potential, some have called for longer tours of duty at th ese laboratories and better communication with the academic and private sectors (Peake et al., 2011). The increase in defense spending pledged by the current administration\u2014perhaps as much as $500 billion (Tiefer, 2016)\u2014presents an opportunity to leverage DoD's research capacity to improve global health research and development. This idea was echoed at a 2015 workshop held by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine on rapid me dical countermeasures response, and further highlighted by DoD's involvement in the developmen t of an Ebola diagnostic test that became the first to receive emergency use authorization for use with U.S. citizens (BioFire Defense, 2014). While DoD's mission is to protect mili tary personnel, many of its research and development efforts can be leveraged to prot ect the civilian populat ion, both domestic and international. The Importance of Proactive Partnerships The U.S. government plays a key role in pr omoting research and development for global health. While funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and DoD is critical for research on the basic science of emerging infect ious diseases, Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) funding is filling a vital gap. In addition, FDA ensures safety and efficacy throughout the research a nd development process. However, governments alone cannot be responsible for driving the gl obal health research and development agenda forward, as the vast amounts of money required for the development of vaccine and therapeutics far outstrip the available government resour ces (see Table 3-2 for funding levels).

Partnerships are vital; the private sector is and will continue to be a key player, but it needs to be included from the initial design stage of projects and be viewed as a partner, not just a source of funds. The newly launched Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), for example, supported by the governments of Germany, Japan, and Norway plus the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the Wellcome Trust, is investing $540 million to finance and coordinate the development of new vaccines to protect against infectious diseases, and views industry partnerships as a co rnerstone operating principle (C EPI, 2017). Chapter 7 explores market incentives for accelerat ing research and development fo r medical product development in more detail, but these types of public-private pa rtnerships and alternative business models are critical to making progress in many of these comple x global health areas that lack a clear market. Finding: Sufficient progress has not been made on the development of vaccines and diagnostics to successfully prevent, detect, and respond to these threats. No system exists to support this developmen t beyond the interagency Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise and the good will of industry partners, which is not a sustainable model. Reducing Impacts of Disaster through Emergency Response Capacity in Low- and Middle- Income Countries For LMICs, simple and cost-effective interven tion strategies can reduce the effects of acute disasters. Emergency response capacity may a ppear to be a secondary priority in LMICs, but there are simple interventions that can build their resilience as well as their capabilities for emergency response. The implementation of the pr eviously explained DRR principles, aimed at enhancing capabilities to minimize the impacts of mass casualty events and natural disasters, is a crucial need in all of these count ries. In fact, more than 5 milli on people die each year as a result of injuries worldwide\u20141.7 times the number of fatalities that result from malaria, TB, and HIV/AIDS combined (WHO, 2014a). More than a quarter of these deaths are road fatalities (WHO, 2017c), which occur predominantly in LMICs (Ning et al., 2016 ; WHO, 2009). Thus these countries have a great unmet need for building trauma response capac ity. Meeting this need will require the combined efforts and capabilitie s of research funding or ganizations, professional societies, NGOs, ministries of health, and gove rnments. Regardless of whether injuries are caused by traffic crashes, earthquakes, or terrorist attacks, there are low-cost opportunities for increasing emergency response capacity to all hazards. While equipping these countries with functional modern trauma hospitals may not be feasible, providing basic training in essential surgical skills, expanding the workforce with the capacity to respond to trauma, and enabling more robust and rapid information sharing are co st-effective options that can help reduce the burden of injury and reduce mortality during a di saster (Acerra et al., 2009; King et al., 2015; Mock et al., 2012). Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States GLOBAL HEALTH SECURITY IS NATIONAL SECURITY 3-27 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Increasing Trauma Capacity Through Training Close to 2 million lost lives\u2014one-third of all deaths due to injury deaths\u2014 in LMICs could have been saved in 2008 by training a workfo rce to im plement inexpensive, basic trauma care (Mock et al., 2012). Training nonphysicians in prehospital tria ge, for example, allows for the appropriate allo cation of health care resources to re spond to injuries as well as emergent diseases. Improving and standard izing care at the prehospital level has the potential to significantly decrease mortality at the earliest stages of disaster response. These basic needs can be met by educating the workforce and disseminating guidelines and standardized protocols of car e to create elementary but cost -effective systems of emergency and trauma care. The WHO Essential Trauma Ca re Project could be us ed to provide first responders with minimal training in simple life- saving care (Acerra et al., 2009; Mock et al., 2006). LMICs, in collaboration w ith such institutions and agencies as DoD, NIH, and USAID, are poised to design and implement programmatic interventions and capa city-building programs tailored to the local and regional needs of poor communities and thereby develop more resilient health systems. A Role for the U.S. Department of Defense DoD recognizes the logistical impossibility of maintaining force readiness entailing continuously deployed medical facilities in all vu lnerable regions of the world. Understanding this limitation, DoD has achieved tremendous gains in trauma care on the battlefield over the last decade that have had a dramatic impact on survival rates among warfighters (Mabry, 2015). Deployed medics and physicians often are depend ed upon to operate outside of their areas of expertise (NASEM, 2016), a task-s hifting approach that can be applied in low- and middle- income settings. Thus, with the ultimate goa l of saving every injured warfighter on the battlefield, DoD has developed a rapid and nimble learning health system. Through an approach termed \"focused empiricism,\"14 it has identified interventions that work, and then adapting its clinical protocols to rapidly implement this new evidence. This knowledge, however, does not always transl ate back to civilian health systems. Accordingly, a 2016 National Academies report was commissioned to advise the United States on how better to integrate the expertise and ev idence from DoD into HHS and civilian hospitals. The authoring committee of that report found that prehospital military trauma care is often more advanced than what U.S. civilian emergency me dical services protocol s allow (Elster et al., 2013; NASEM, 2016). Just as that committee identified an opportunity for disseminating DoD knowledge to the U.S. civilian health system, th ere is also an opportunity for knowledge gained from operating in austere conditions to be shared and implemented around the world. Some key lessons from military health operations include using pain medications, such as ketamine, in the prehospital st age to minimize pain and postin jury mental health sequelae (NASEM, 2016). Ketamine has been found to be an extremely useful anesthetic in the global 14 As defined by a recent National Academies report (NASEM, 2016, p.6), \"Focused empiricism is a concept embraced by U.S. military medical lead ership to capture its approach to pr ocess improvement under circumstances in which 1) high-quality data are not available to inform clinical practice changes, 2) there is extreme urgency to improve outcomes because of high morbid ity and mortality rates, and 3) data collection is possible (Elster et al., 2013). A key principle of focused empiricism is using the best data available in combination with experience to develop clinical practice guidelines that, through an iterative process, continue to be refined until high-quality data can be generated to further inform c linical practice and standards of care.\" Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States 3-28 GLOBAL HEALTH AND THE FUTURE ROLE OF THE UNITED STATES PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS south because of its applicability in low-res ource settings without acce ss to electricity for ventilators or oxygen and its ease of administration by nonanesthetists. As shown by the military, it is also often used off-label as an analgesic and makes surgeries such as Cesarean sections possible in many austere environm ents, leading WHO to designate it as an essential medicine. Combat gauze, a clotting agent used to stop bl ood loss more quickly, is another important life- saving advance used in the military, which has b een found to be associated with a 93 percent survival rate (Ran et al., 2010). An easy and co st-effective intervention, combat gauze could be adopted by responders in LMICs. Inspiring the Stop the Bleed campaign in the United States, military first responders also carry proper tourni quets for hemorrhage control when assessing for evacuation to a higher-level facility. A st udy following the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing found that prehospital response to extremity exsanguination was inadequate, and that better transfer of information on techniqu es and tools from the battlefiel d is needed (Ki ng et al., 2015), which could be accomplished through proper use and administration of tourniquets. This same observation applies to global hea lth programs and platforms. The lessons learned from the battlefield abou t injury assessment, triage, and emergency care can be used to dramatically improve trauma care in LMICs. Building this capacity in U.S. partner countries would be benefi cial not only for citizens of thos e countries but also for U.S. citizens traveling abroad. It al so would support DoD interests ab road, as maintaining a civilian trauma system\u2014especially during conflict\u2014is an obligation of the military that helps it achieve its own strategic objectives. The better such a sy stem functions, the fewer injured civilians will require treatment in military field hospitals. These efforts already occur, as the military understands the benefits of engaging with pa rtner nations and building and supporting their health system capabilities (DHA, n.d.). In a rece nt example, U.S. Navy sailors provided Kenyan soldiers tactical combat medical training, incl uding basic cardiopulmonary resuscitation; first aid; techniques for stopping massive bleeding; and the use of tourniquets, splints, and compression (DeNault, 2016). Similar training was provided to Ugandan soldiers as well (McDonald, 2015). Conducting workshops for local co mmunities that provide such training can improve their ability to mitigate their burden of injury and trauma, as well as increase their readiness for disaster and build resilience. These types of trai ning opportunities and information exchanges could become more prevalent thr ough increased communication between DoD, the U.S. Department of State, and countries' militaries or ministries of health, or through USAID in health systems-building activities. Finding: An emergency response workfor ce can be developed through traditional public health training programs; rapid and nimble implementation of emerging evidence and best practices for providing e ffective and efficient health care; and leveraging the knowledge base developed in other networks, such as the U.S. military. SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS Wide-ranging threats to global health security influenced by resour ce scarcity, rapid urbanization, and inadequacies in stewardshi p of medications are poised to exploit the vulnerability of all countries , including the United States (Clapper, 2016; GAO, 2017; WHO, 2016a). These threats range from infectious di sease spillover to pandemic influenza, to antimicrobial resistance, and are exacerbated by such vulnerabilities as degrading public health Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States GLOBAL HEALTH SECURITY IS NATIONAL SECURITY 3-29 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS infrastructure, weak m edical supply chains, and fragile states. It is critical for the United States to realize the severity of these th reats and to take proactive meas ures to combat them by building capabilities and protections in a su stainable and cost-effective manner. However, health preparedness systems and infrastructure (in the United States and abroad) are drastically underresourced (Boddie et al., 2015; Levi et al., 2015b). As a result, levels of preparedness are decades behind where they should be, making it difficult to meet the massive needs that arise when an emergency occurs. Funding for preparedness has decreased dramatically since the Public Health Security and Bioterrori sm Response Act was enacted in 2002. In fiscal year 2016, funding for the Publ ic Health Emergency Preparedness Program decreased from an initial level of $1.03 billi on in 2003 to $660 million (Levi et al., 2015b; Segal et al., 2016) and funding for the Hospital Prepared ness Program decreased from an initial level of $515 million in 2004 to $255 million (Segal et al., 2016). Yet, once an emergency does occur, large amounts of funding are releas ed, but typically not in a time ly or systematic manner. For example, during the Ebola outbreak in 2014, whic h involved just four U.S. cases, the United States spent $1.1 billion on domestic response (Epstein, et al., 2015), more than 120 percent of the nation's entire annual budget fo r capacity building for health preparedness systems. Airport screening and follow-up of potentially sick passengers alone incurred costs totaling $119 million (CDC, 2015a). However, in response to the Zika virus the following y ear, the funding response was much different. After 7 months of disagreem ent and delay in approving President Obama's request for $1.9 billion in Zika funding, Congre ss finally approved $1.1 billion with the passage of H.R. 5243 15 (Wexler et al., 2016a). Until then, agencies were forced to shift funds from other accounts for Zika-related activities, includi ng borrowing from the Ebola supplemental funding and from CDC's state-level emergency public h ealth care preparedness account (Epstein and Lister, 2016; Kodjak, 2016). Moreover, although multip le agencies bring unique expertise to a U.S. government-led response, it is difficult to coor dinate an urgent plan during a crisis without strong leadership, a well-defined chain of command, and an adequate budget. Finally, sufficient progress has not been made on the development of vaccines and diagnostics to successfully prevent, detect, and respond to these threats. No system exists to support this development beyond the interage ncy Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise and the good will of industry partners, which is not a sustainable model. Adequately protecting U.S. citizens requires strong capabilities to dete ct the potential for a pandemic, ensure the availability of need ed medical products, and provide the necessary capacity in the nation's hospitals and health departments. Conclusion: The current system for addressing health security threats described in this report is inadequate. A proactive, comprehensive approach would be more cost-effective and generate higher return s than ad hoc reactionary responses to individual events as they occur. The former approach can be enabled through the development of cross-cutting platforms and a targeted systematic investment strategy (discussed in Recommendations 12 and 13 in Chapter 8) can enable this needed approach. Simultaneously, there is a need for improved coordination during an international public health emergency that combines the knowledge, networks, and assets of domestic and in ternational health emergency response within the relevant U .S. government agencies and empowers action and decision- making through dedicated leadership and funding. 15 Zika Response Appropriations Act, H.R. 5243. 2016.

As a result, levels of preparedness for health departments and hospitals are decades behind where they should be, making it difficult to meet the massive needs that arise when an emergency occurs. Addressing these inadequate fundi ng levels is a crit ical priority. Conclusion: An important positive step to improve rapid response capacity would be to implement the recommendation of the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology to establish a public health emergency response fund, with adequate funding in pla ce, to be used only for res ponse activities in declared public health emergencies. Conclusion: To ensure that the drugs, vaccines, diagnostics, and devices critically needed to address health security threats are devel oped and available, a critical medical product development fund is required. This fund would support long- term, stable research and development to engage industry, academia, and other partners in the development of medical pr oducts for high-priority threats (based on the listing of the Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise). Recommendation 1: Improve Internationa l Emergency Response Coordination The administration should create a c oordinating body for international public health emergency response that is accountable for international and domestic actions and oversee preparedness for and responses to global health security threats. This body should have its own budget, experience with handling logistics, and the authority n ecessary to coordinate players across the government at the deputy secretary le vel. This coordinating body should do the following: Oversee the creation of an International Response Framework to guide the U.S. response to an international health em ergency. Through this framework, this body would coordinate and direct activiti es involved in international response and preparedness, but would not duplicate functions already established in the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Preventi on, the U.S. Agency for International Development, or the Department of Defense. Oversee three separate funding stre ams, dedicated to investments in preparedness, emergency response, and critical medical product development.The Office of Management and Budget sh ould conduct an analysis to determine the appropriate levels for these three funding streams, commensurate with the associated risk, understanding that predic table and timely funds for these three purposes are critical.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States GLOBAL HEALTH SECURITY IS NATIONAL SECURITY 3-31 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Align and coordinate e fforts with effective multilateral organizations to reduce duplication and promote efficiency in bu ilding capacity and resilience in other countries. The growing threat of antimicrobial resist ance resulting from poor stewardship, weak surveillance systems, and a lack of potential new therapeutics will be a major threat to the entire global community\u2014in terms of both lives lost and impacts on the global economy\u2014in the next 10 years. While there has been progress toward Go al 5 of the National Action Plan, there remain challenges that hinder its full realization, including difficulties in providing incentives for the development of diagnostics and therapeutics. Howeve r, a particularly criti cal barrier is the lack of sufficient funds to advance the AMR agenda. While funds have been appropriated in recent years towards domestic efforts, there is very li ttle money for international activities focused on AMR. Yet, with up to 30 percent of drugs being sold in LMICs found to be counterfeit (Cockburn, et al., 2005; WHO, 2011b), there is a need for focused attention on safeguarding legitimate pharmaceutical supply chains that can co mplement a \"One Health\" approach to ensure proper stewardship of antibiotic s and robust communication across the human and animal health sectors (CDC, 2017b), thereby re ducing the spread of AMR. Conclusion: A coordinated and dedicated gl obal effort to addre ss the threat of antimicrobial resistance is needed, with a focus on countries experiencing a high incidence. Conclusion: It is essential to remain engaged and coordinated with domestic and international stakeholders, including the World Health Organization, the United Nations Secretary General's Committee on Antimicrobial Resistance, and the Global Health Security Agenda. Recommendation 2: Combat Antimicrobial Resistance The U.S. Department of Health and Human S ervices, the U.S. Department of Defense, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) should continue to invest in national capabilities and accelerate the development of international capabilitie s to detect, monitor, report, and combat antibiotic resistance. Efforts to this end should include the following: Enhance surveillance systems to ensure th at new resistant microbial strains are identified as soon as they emerge. Assist low-income countries in improvi ng infection control and antimicrobial stewardship. USAID should leverage current supply chain partnerships with other countries to strengthen antibiotic supply chains, t hus reducing the use of illegitimate antimicrobials and improving drug quality. Incentivize the development of therapeutics (including alternativ es to antibiotics), vaccines, and diagnostics for use in humans and animals.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States 3-32 GLOBAL HEALTH AND THE FUTURE ROLE OF THE UNITED STATES PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS While many low- and middle-income countries function in low-resource settings during steady-state times, disasters can plunge these coun tries into even more challenging and austere circumstances. While modern infr astructure often is not feasible in these countries because of high costs, smaller-scale steps entailing pro cess innovation can be taken in communities to improve their ability to respond to disasters. Whether responding to more slowing evolving public health emergencies such as disease outbrea ks or more immediate injury events such as road traffic accidents, earthquakes, or terror attacks, having a properly trained workforce in accordance with the principles of disaster risk reduction can lead to safer and more resilient communities. Such a workforce can be develope d through traditional public health training programs; rapid and more nimble implementatio n of emerging evidence and best practices for providing effective and efficient health care; and leveraging of the knowledge base developed in other networks, such as the U.S. military. Enabling the right systems capacity to reduce risk, respond, and then iterate and innovate can allow for greater progress in a s horter period of time. After many years of insufficient siloed and ad hoc investments, this type of systems approach, information exchange, and country coinvestment and partnership would be a welcome change. Conclusion: Simple yet effective strategies exist for reducing the risk of disaster for communities around the world. Employing the principles of disaster risk reduction when developing capacity for health care preparedness and response provides a framework for continuous le arning and its itera tive application to health care delivery systems. Recommendation 3: Build Public Health Capa city in Low- and Middle-Income Countries The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prev ention, the National Institutes of Health, the U.S. Department of Defense, and the U.S. Agency for International Development should expand training and information exch ange efforts to increase the capacity of low- and middle-income countries to respo nd to both public health emergencies and acute mass casualty disasters. This trai ning and information exchange should encompass core capacities such as surveill ance, epidemiology, and disaster and injury care response, as well as enhanced capabilities to improve communication and information pathways for the disse mination of innovative findings.

The war and the influenza pande mic were closely intertwined, and as a result, the disease spread globally and affected almost every country involved in the war. In addition to its global reach, the pandemi c had a number of unique characteristics. Rather than appearing in the familiar annual pattern of influenza, the 1918-1919 pandemic took place in three waves that occurre d in quick succession, the first of which was in the spring of 1918. While identifying a point of origin for the pandemic is difficult given that it appeared to spread simultaneously thr oughout Europe, Asia, and North America, evidence suggests that it emerge d in the United States (Barry, 2004) and spread to Europe when the United States entered the war (Byerly, 2010). During the first wave, illness rates were high, but death rate s were close to normal. The second wave, occurring in the fall of 1918, spread the disease globally and was highly fatal, likely a result of the crowded conditions in training camps and trench warfare that enabled the virus to evolve. The third phase occurred in early 1919, and a lthough less deadly, continued to spread the disease. The occurrence of three pandemic wa ves in such quick succession was unprecedented, as was the age group the pandemic uniquely affected: young adults. Typically, the highest influenza mortality ra tes occur among the very young and the very old. However, the 1918-1919 pandemic also h eavily affected those aged 20-40, an age group in which half of the deat hs during the pandemic occurred. Although 675,000 Americans were among the dead, the legacy of the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic has receded from memory in the United States, such that historians call it \"America's forgotten pandemic\" (Gar rett, 2007). This fading from memory is dangerous considering that learning from the pa st is instrumental in adequately preparing for the future. That the pandemic likely originated in the United States, moreover, serves as a reminder that such threats can emerge anywhere. Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

The 2009 US-EU Summit Declaration established a Transatlantic Taskforce on AMR to strengthen collaboration between the United States and the EU in prom oting the adequate use of antimicrobials for animal and human health, implementing preven tion strategies in hospital and community settings, and developing new an timicrobials (TATFAR, 2014). In 2014, the 67th World Health Assembly (WHA) requested that the World Health Organization (WHO) director general de velop a global action plan to address the growing threat of AMR. In a tripartite co llaboration with the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) and th e Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations (UN), and embracing the One Health approach, the World Health Organization (WHO) developed the Global Action Plan on AMR with the technical support of its Strategic and Technical Advisory Gr oup on AMR (STAG-AMR) (WHO, 2015). This global action plan outlines five strategic objectives with corresponding actions for Member States, the Secretariat (composed of WHO, OIE, and FAO), and international organizations and other partne rs. The five objectives are 1.to improve awareness and understanding of AMR through effectivecommunication, educati on, and training; 2. to strengthen the knowledge and evidence base through surveillance and research; 3.to reduce the incidence of infection through effectiv e sanitation, hygiene, and infection prevention measures; 4.to optimize the use of antimicrobial me dicines in human and animal health; and 5.to develop the economic case for sustaina ble investment that takes account of the needs of all counties and to increase investment in new medicines,diagnostic tools, vaccines and other interventions. WHO called on Member States to devel op national action plans aligned with these global plan objectives within 2 years of the plan's endorsement by the WHA in May 2015. WHO, in collaboration with FAO a nd OIE, prepared a manual to guide the development or refinement of these nati onal plans and a monitoring and evaluation framework to help countries track the progr ess of the implementation of their national plans. As of the release of this report, only 31 countries ha d shared their national action plans for AMR with the WHO library, with only a few months remaining until the deadline in May 2017 (WHO, 2017a).

The plan outlines in detail objectives; subobjectives; Year 1, Year 3, and Year 5 milestones; performance metrics; and implementation timelines for each goal in th e National Strategy. These goals include the following: 1.Slow the Emergence of Resistant Bacteria and Prevent the Spread of Resistant Infections. 2.Strengthen National One-Health Surveill ance Efforts to Combat Resistance. 3.Advance Development and Use of Rapi d and Innovative Diagnostic Tests for Identification and Characteriza tion of Resistant Bacteria. 4.Accelerate Basic and Applied Rese arch and Development for New Antibiotics, Other Therapeutics, and Vaccines. 5.Improve International Collaboration a nd Capacities for Antibiotic-Resistance Prevention, Surveillance, Control, and An tibiotic Research and Development. As required by executive order, the Task Force for Combating Antibiotic- Resistant Bacteria submitted a report (P ACCARB, 2016) assessing the progress made toward the proposed milestones for each of the National Action Plan goals after the first 180 days of the plan's release. That report identified key actions taken to advance each of the five goals. For goal 1, the report noted that both huma n and animal health stewardship efforts were under way: the Centers for Medicaid & Me dicare Services revise d the participation requirements for inpatient and long-term care facilities to include antibiotic stewardship programs, and the U.S. Food and Drug Admi nistration (FDA) amended the veterinary feed directive (VFD) regulations to a llow the use of a VFD drug only under the supervision of a licensed veterinarian. For goal 2, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in collaboration w ith FDA, launched the AR Isolate Bank, a repository of samples of well-characterized re sistance bacteria profiles. This repository will serve as a data source for industry and academia for the development of new diagnostics and treatment. For goal 3, the Natio nal Institutes of Health (NIH) invested more than $11 million to support the first year of research for nine projects aimed at developing rapid diagnostic tool s for resistant bacteria. Goal 4 proved to be one of the most challenging, as the pipeline for antibio tic development is quite small, with very limited incentives for industry. Nevertheless, the U.S. government continues to support discovery and early-stage development of new drugs. Finally, for goal 5, the U.S. government worked closely with internationa l partners to support implementation of WHO's Global Action Plan on AMR through its work with the Globa l Health Security Agenda (GHSA) AMR Action Package. Sp ecifically, the GHSA AMR Action Package supports the development of national action pl ans; the development and strengthening of surveillance and laboratory capac ity; and the development of new treatments, diagnostics, preventive measures, and systems to prolong the effective use of current therapies.

In 2002, AIDS was the leading cause of death worldwide among people ages 15-59, and more than 30 million pe ople worldwide were infected (UNAIDS, 2016a). Although HIV/AIDS is no lo nger necessarily a death sent ence, and people living with HIV/AIDS are able to treat it as a chronic dis ease, there is still no vaccine and no cure. With 2 million new infections, 1.1 million deaths, a nd 36.7 million people living with HIV in 2015, there is a clear need for heightened attenti on (UNAIDS, 2015d). TB, often an overlooked danger, saw 10.4 million new cases in 2015 and 1.4 million deaths1 worldwide (WHO, 2016c). In the United States alone, 9,557 cases of TB o ccurred in 2015. Although this was a 64.2 percent decrease from 1992, it was a 1.6 percent increase from 2014 (CDC, 2016a). Multiple strains of TB are resistant to one or more medications, with very few new drugs under development to address them. Finally, malaria continues to pl ague many countries, with 212 million new cases causing 429,000 deaths globally in 2015 (WHO, 2 016d). Although malaria is rarely carried by mosquitoes in the United States, it is a constant threat to many U.S. travelers, international employees, and military members visiting and wo rking in other countri es. HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria have a huge detrimental effect on the aff licted countries, making it difficult to foster growing economies and pr ogressive societies. HIV/AIDS Beginning in the early 2000s, the HIV/AI DS pandemic and the global attention it received resulted in a great deal of funding and research toward finding drugs and other treatments and helping those with HIV improve th eir quality of life. Becau se of these concerted efforts by the global community, about 18.2 million people living with HIV now have access to antiretroviral therapy\u2014a major f eat, considering that just 16 years ago, fewer than 1 million people had access (HHS, 2016). This increased access is a testament to the power of collective action, as the global target of 15 million peopl e receiving HIV treatment by 2015 was reached 9 months ahead of schedule (UNAIDS, 2015c). As a result of these efforts, new infections decreased globally by 35 percent between 2000 and 2015, and AIDS-related deaths decreased by 42 percent between 2005 and 2015 (UNAIDS, 2015a). Such an accomplishment is due in large 1 There were 1.8 million TB deaths worldwide in 2015, but 0.39 million of these occurred among people with an HIV infection. When an HIV-positive person dies from TB, the underlying cause is classified as HIV in the International Classification of Disease Systems (ICD-10th Revision) (WHO, 2016c).

All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States 4-2 GLOBAL HEALTH AND THE FUTURE ROLE OF THE UNITED STATES PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS part to the availability of sustainable funding, which is infrequently a ccessible for infectious disease efforts. The story of the HIV/AIDS pandemic is still fraught with tragedy. Despite this success, people in sub-Saharan Africa continue to face the highest burden of disease worldwide, with 69.5 percent2 of people living with HIV and 65.2 percent3 of new infections occurring in that region in 2015 (UNAIDS, 2016a). Additionally, progress with in vulnerable populations has been slower in sub-Saharan Africa than other parts of th e world, with adolescent girls and young women at disproportionate risk: AIDS is the leading cau se of death among women of reproductive age (UNAIDS, 2015c). Global progress is also precarious ly at risk, as only 60 percent of people with HIV know their status, and the remaining 40 perc ent still need access to HIV testing services (HHS, 2016). That people under th e age of 25 frequently do not know their HIV status and that there are now 200 million people between 15 and 24 y ears of age in sub-Saharan Africa creates the potential for the pandemic to surge out of control again (PEPFAR, 2016a). The global community and U.S. government's enthusiasm to end the AIDS pandemic has led to the establishment of lofty targets. Curre nt global strategy is guide d by the 90-90-90 agenda of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/ AIDS, which, by 2020 aims to have 90 percent of people living with HIV knowing their status ; 90 percent of people with diagnosed HIV infection receiving sustained antiretroviral treatment; and 90 percent of all people on antiretroviral treatment having viral suppre ssion (UNAIDS, 2014a). To support these goals, funders have crafted their own strategies. For example, The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB, and Malaria Strategy 2017-2022 to End Epidemics aims to maximize the impact of its investments through finding differentiated appr oaches for diverse country cont exts, increased alignment, and planning for sustainability of programs that tackle the disease (The Global Fund, 2016). The global monetary support for HIV/AIDS programs now totals about $19 billion annually, dwarfing funding provided for any ot her single disease. In 2015, $10.9 billion\u201457 percent of the total\u2014 came from domestic, in-country sources (AVERT, 2017; UNAIDS, 2016b). However, donor sources contribute in a variety of ways, especially for low-income countries that still heavily rely on external ai d to finance their HIV response, with 44 countries relying on 75 percent or more of interna tional assistance in 2014 (AVERT , 2017). Private funding accounted for $618 million in fiscal year (FY) 2014 (Kates et al., 2016). The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), which is responsible for the U.S. government's response to global HIV, contributed $5.22 billion in FY 2016 to bilateral HIV/AIDS programs,4 to Fund5 million toward TB/H IV programs (PEPFAR, 2016b). This funding has remained stagnant for se veral years, forcing the PEPFAR program to make difficult decisions in priorities as more patients are put on lif elong treatment regimens. 2 In 2015, 36.7 million people were living with HIV glob ally, 25.5 million of whom were in sub-Saharan Africa. These figures were obtained by selecting \"People living with HIV\" as an indicator (UNAIDS, 2016a). 3 In 2015, 2.1 million new HIV infections occurred globa lly, 1.37 million of which we re in sub-Saharan Africa. These figures were obtained by selecting \"New HIV infections\" as an indicator (UNAIDS, 2016a). 4 Funding for bilateral HIV/AIDS programs covers funding for bilateral funding programs and regional programs in addition to contributions to the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, the In ternational AIDS Vaccine Initiative, microbicides, and National Institutes of Health AIDS research (PEPFAR, 2016c). 5 This is the total U.S. contribution to The Global Fund.

Initially, it was a true emergency response at a time when entire generations in Africa were dying, leaving behind 14 m illion orphans and vulnerable children (PEPFAR, 2016a). One of PEPFAR's strengths from its inception was its use of senior- level leadership to monitor and coordinate its interagency efforts to drive change. The program shifted to Phase II under the Obama administration once the crisis had abated; it maintained a focus on saving lives but placed greater emphasis on sustainability through partnership frameworks and mutual acco untability. PEPFAR most recently shifted to Phase III, directing attention to what is likely to be the most challenging phase: getting the pandemic under sustainable control (PEPFAR, 2012a). As of September 30, 2015, PEPFAR has supported antiretroviral treatm ent for 9.5 million people and has reduced the number of new infections in its focus countries from 2.58 million in 2003 to 1.48 million in 2015 (PEPFAR, 2017a). With so many individuals dependent on the PEPFAR program for life-saving treatment and the dangerous potential for regression gi ven the rapid youth popul ation growth in many PEPFAR countries, there is an ethical imperative that PEPFAR be continued. Furthermore, more people are living with HIV/AIDS today than when the program st arted in 2003 (UNAIDS, 2016a), demonstrating the need for continued investment. The sustainability of an ongoing program like PEPFAR demands occasional realignm ent and shifting of priorities, as well as changes in the way it operates while maintaini ng its prior humanitarian commitments. Such changes should reflect the cha nges in the pandemic and various microepidemics (i.e., small- scale, community-level epidemics) as the disease continues to evolve. BOX 4-1 The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) Achievements to Date The influence of PEPFAR has been profound, th anks to many years of bipartisan support from Congress. In addition to providing 11.5 million people with life-saving drugs, preventing 2 million babies from being born with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and halving the adult death rate in PEPFAR-supported countries within 5 years of program rollout, PEPFAR has led to a number of ec onomic benefits for partner countries that improve the prosperity of American businesses and the safety of the American people, including 13 percent higher employment rates am ong men in PEPFAR countries than in non- PEPFAR countries; a three times higher development rate in PEPFAR countries as compared to non- PEPFAR countries an increase in positive opinion of the United States from 40 to 68 percent by people in PEPFAR countries compared to 40 to 46 percent in non-PEPFAR countries between 2007 and 2011; Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States 4-4 GLOBAL HEALTH AND THE FUTURE ROLE OF THE UNITED STATES PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS PEPFAR has recently increased its use of data-driven programming. This change has allowed the program to report statistics on the HIV/AIDS burden in countries and on antiretroviral coverage and patient s' viral loads at the district level. The data-driven focus has improved the measurement of the number of patien ts on treatment. Increased data collection has been accompanied by a concomitant increase in understanding the socioeconomic influences of virus transmission, which should continue to be examined and analyzed to determine the best course of action. For example, although the inci dence rates of HIV in most PEPFAR countries have declined, the rates have increased for popul ations most at risk, such as young women. As many as 380,000 adolescent girls and young wome n (ages 10-24) are infected each year globally, often due to gender-based violence (GBV) and exploitation by older men (UNAIDS, 2014b). In fact, women who experience GBV are thre e times more likely to contract HIV than women who do not (PEPFAR, 2015). Additionally, this group of women acquires HIV 5 to 7 years earlier than men (UNAIDS, 2014b) and is th ree times more likely to be HIV positive than men of the same age (PEPFAR, 2015). One of the main future challenges for the PEPFAR program will be ascertaining the amount of money it can spend on direct treatment for patients versus th e amount it can spend on prevention. When the PEPFAR program was create d, the initial authoriz ation from Congress called for 55 percent of funding to be spent on tr eatment. That requirement was carried over in the reauthorization legi slation in 2008 but was relaxed s lightly in 2013, when the PEPFAR Stewardship and Oversight Act of 2013 6 called for just half of bila teral funds to be directed toward treatment and care versus 55 percent (KFF, 2017c; PEPFAR, 2017a). Next Generation of PEPFAR The clear returns from PEPFAR investments s how that its involveme nt contributes to better overall health outcomes in a country. Stud ies have indicated that PEPFAR focus countries have higher male employment rates th an similar non-PEPFAR focus countries7 (Wagner et al., 2015) and have improved opinions of the United States (Daschle and Frist, 2015). Further enabling PEPFAR platforms to serve other countr y-specific health needs could increase this return on investment. Doing so is critical for dr iving future U.S. global health efforts and for 6 PEPFAR Stewardship and Oversight Act of 2013, Public Law 113-56 7 PEPFAR focus countries include Botswana, Cote d' Ivoire, Ethiopia, Guyana, Haiti, Kenya, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Vietnam, and Zambia (KFF, 2017c). an 86 percent viral suppression among those being treated in Zimbabwe, Zambia, and Malawi, indicating these countries are on the path to controlling the epidemic; a 16 to 20 percent less likelihood of dying of human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) in PEPFAR countries as compared to non-PEPFAR countries; a positive trend toward lower tuberculosis rates for PEPFAR countries.

To look to the future in phasing down dire ct PEPFAR costs and incorporating health needs of countries, a priority for PEPFAR should be to continue supporting countries in their transition from bilateral aid to domestic fina ncing by aiding in the mobilization of domestic resources for HIV/AIDS (and health more broadly). This shift w ould inevitably also allow more country ownership and decision making in their pl anning of national AIDS programs. This effort will require realistic country-specific assessments and strategies for building each national health system's capacity to assume financial and opera tional responsibilities for service delivery. A caveat is that domestic resource mobilization ma y be a more realistica lly viable option for middle-income countries than for many low-income countries, which may have very little fiscal space in which to maneuver. In those cases, low- income countries will continue to rely on support from donors like the United St ates in order to keep HIV in fection rates from surging out of control. A range of opinions exists about how to best support national governments in this transition, but many emphasize the need to ince ntivize and encourage country-driven funding by devising innovative, creative, and flexible fina ncing strategies (Oomman et al., 2007; PEPFAR, 2009; Resch et al., 2015). Since meeting with other partners in 2015, PEPFAR and the U.S. Treasury are working with ministri es of finance in recipient count ries to create HIV expenditure committees and improve coordination of funding s ources to increase efficiency and use domestic resources most effectively (PEPFAR, 2016a). Unde r these partnerships, the U.S. Department of the Treasury may provide technical assistance to finance ministries to strengthen public financial management of health resources. Another mean s for decreasing recipien t countries' reliance on PEPFAR for AIDS treatment is for the U.S. govern ment to direct more of its AIDS budget to The Global Fund, which utilizes a unique e-marketplace8 to create a competitive market for specific health products and a Pooled Proc urement Mechanism by which The Global Fund negotiates favorable procurement terms for h ealth products (The Gl obal Fund, 2017). As a way to make current taxpayer funds go further, PEPFAR should also continue to employ key partnerships with the private sector focused on prevention, treatment, and care and support. In the case of supply chain management, for ex ample, one partnership implemented new approaches to several steps in the supply chai n, ensuring inventory was used before expiration and managing costs through pooling procurement (Sturchio and Cohen, 2012). Partially because of this infrastructure, PEPFAR was able to increase its proportion of generic drugs and contribute to reducing the annual cost of treatment per patient by nearly $700 (PEPFAR, 2012b). The committee solicited information from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and the U.S. Centers fo r Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) field staff in multiple countries on PEPFAR's successes and challenges.9 Overall, respondents reported that the PEPFAR program was genera lly well-received in countries and was significantly increasing the number of patients on treatment and d ecreasing HIV infection rates. Some respondents noted that country leaders understandably apprecia ted the technical and financial support provided by PEPFAR but wanted a greater de gree of responsibility in decision making and prioritizing. In some cases, the priority of the U.S. program did not reflect the health 8 See more at http://www.wambo.o rg/home (accessed March 8, 2017). 9 See Chapter 1 for the full description of the information gathering process. Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States 4-6 GLOBAL HEALTH AND THE FUTURE ROLE OF THE UNITED STATES PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS priority of the host government. To alleviate this mismatch, some respondents recommended a shift in focus toward health systems strengthening or capacity building. Broadening the Approach There has been a growing understanding\u2014both in the United States and internationally\u2014 of the need to broaden the spectrum of health ca re in a country by adopting a \"development lens\" that addresses the social and economic vulnerabil ities of families and indi viduals multisectorally to achieve better outcomes in health, educat ion, and livelihood (UNAIDS, 2015c). Field staff respondents supported this approa ch by noting that although epid emic control is important, thousands of children and adults dying from prev entable causes such as l ack of access to care or safe water demonstrates the program's need to broaden. Offering various types of interventions through the PEPFAR platform can ensure that patie nts are being viewed holistically while they are interacting with the health care system. For example, when HIV patients visit a clinic for treatment or testing, they could also be provi ded with education on nut rition or blood pressure screening and hypertension awaren ess, as some pilot projects are beginning to do through PEPFAR. Anecdotal results report that a patient with HIV who is on antiretroviral therapy can now receive care for hypertension or diabetes at the same clinic (Green, 2016). These program innovations are still somewhat limited in th eir design and depth, however, and funding is difficult. With all these considerations in mind, alternative methods of operation could be explored that can complement innovative financing strategies. When considering new, broader approaches , there is a clear objective to couple PEPFAR's services with those of other U.S. agencies and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) working on nutrition efforts. People who take antiretroviral th erapy often encounter food insecurity as a critical barrier to linkage to care, treatment adherence, retention in care, and viral load suppression. Malnourishe d people living with HIV are two to six times more likely to die within the first 6 months of treatment than si milar patients who are not malnourished (UNAIDS, 2015b). Currently, nutrition assessment, counseling, and support are classified as \"near core\" interventions based on country context, but nutrition should be prioritized for all PEPFAR patients (PEPFAR, 2016a).10 Leveraging Partnerships Although PEPFAR has had informal partnerships with host-country st akeholders (i.e., civil society), it has now begun to incorporate these relationships into all aspects of its programming in order to ach ieve sustainability and se lf-sufficiency. PEPFAR's 2017 Annual Report to Congress states that now more than ever it enc ourages full participat ion of civil society to ensure they \"have a voice at the decisi on-making table\" (PEPFAR, 2017a). Partner governments and civil society organi zations are now keenly involved in all aspects of the country operational plan process, which for the first tim e includes representatives from ministries of health and a large number of civil society organi zations. This is a much different approach to country operational plan development than in pr evious years, and it has been extremely well- 10 PEPFAR defines \"core\" inte rventions as activities central to HIV/AIDS that are critical to saving lives and preventing new infections and are grounded in science. \"Near-core\" interventions are defined as activities that directly support HIV/AIDS goals and cannot yet be done well by other partners or the host government, and \"non- core\" interventions are activities that do not directly affect HIV/AIDS goals and/or can be taken on by other partners or the host government (PEPFAR, 2016a).

The committee fully supports this new direction for PEPFAR and encourages more partnerships like th e Determined, Resilient, Empowered, AIDS-free, Mentored, and Safe women (DREAM S) initiative (described in Box 4-2) and other engagements with community-level organizations to he lp drive sustainability, implementation, and effectiveness. PEPFAR funding rules require that money is spent only on activities that focus on narrowly defined indicators related to scali ng up treatment and decr easing HIV infection. Although the committee agrees these goals are impor tant, addressing more general health goals through the same PEPFAR interven tion would be easier if the indi cators were defined a little more broadly. For example, \"capacity building\" could be added to the 50 percent on treatment and care allocation. Local workforce capacity is an ongoing challenge in many of these countries. The Medical Education Partnershi p Initiative (MEPI) a nd Nursing Education Partnership Initiative (NEPI) were created in re sponse to the poor trea tment outcomes resulting from the paucity of trained me dical professionals in PEPFAR c ountries in 2010. These programs allowed PEPFAR to fund African medical instituti ons to increase the numb er of high-quality, in- country nurses and doctors (OARAC, 2015). In their 5 years of partnerships, MEPI and NE PI have significantly improved capacity for education and research at in-countr y universities. For inst ance, at the University of Botswana, the MEPI program helped to establish and strengthen teaching sites, which led to the first-ever graduation of 80 locally trained do ctors. The successes of the MEPI and NEPI partnerships mean the progress made possible by PEPFAR interventions will not be lost because there are too few medical professionals to treat pa tients. In FY2017, this partnershi p will be reinstated under a new name and, in learning from past MEPI and NEPI programs, will be more focused on medical and nursing education. Awardee instituti ons are encouraged to collabo rate with the newly formed African Forum for Research and Ed ucation in Health, international partners that share the same goals, and successful MEPI and NEPI programs (NIH, 2016). This updated program will emphasize interdepartmental collaboration with in awardee universities, as well as the development of partnerships w ith other universities and school s in their country to further expand the research workforce and resources. Th ese goals advance the Fogarty Inte rnational Center work by expanding research capacity among i ndividuals, institutions , and larger networks and strengthening partnerships to advance global health research. Understanding some of these broader dete rminants, PEPFAR's DREAMS project began in 2014 as a $385 million partnership to reduc e HIV infection in young women in 10 sub- Saharan African countries. Recognizing that HIV infection vulnerabilities in this population extend far beyond the health sector, DREAMS addre sses the structural driv ers of HIV infection, such as poverty, gender-based violence and inequa lity, and education (s ee Box 4-2) (PEPFAR, 2017b). The program is still young and represents only 5 percent of the PEPFAR budget. The committee believes that more cross-sector and multidisciplinary programs like this should be explored not only to reduce HIV in fection rates, but also to more holistically address social and development challenges and have a greater effect overall while leveraging the strengths of other stakeholders.

All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States 4-8 GLOBAL HEALTH AND THE FUTURE ROLE OF THE UNITED STATES PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS BOX 4-2 The Determined, Resilient, Empowered, AIDS-Free, Mentored, and Safe women (DREAMS) Initiative DREAMS is a $385 million partnership addressing the multidisciplinary factors that contribute to disproportionately high rates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in young women. The partnership focuses on young women in high-burden locations of Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe, with a goal of 40 percent reduction in new HIV infections among adolescent girls and young women by the end of 2017. The multifactorial nature of a social disease such as HIV/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) requires changing nonhealth fact ors, such as increasing access to secondary education, reducing gender-based violence, building stronger parenting relationships, and changing the community norms and structures that prevent the success of young women. To make these changes in a robust and successful way, DREAMS leverages expertise from priv ate and philanthropic partners. Johnson & Johnson is using its marketing expertise in understanding consumer behavior to target services to young girls. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is funding impact evaluation and implementation research to evaluate success. Gilead is purchasing medication and funding operational expenses for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for uninfected young women at high risk. Nike's Girl Effect is funding the use of a toolkit to help identify and target adolescent girls in the hardest-to-reach areas, develop culturally appropriate brands, and address social norm change. Finally, ViiV healthcare is providing capacity-building support to community organizations. The team has also launched the DREAMS Innovation Challenge, committing $85 million to test newer solutions for preventing new infections among adolescent girls and young women. The challenge was designed to infuse new thinking and high-impact approaches and to engage new partners with local understanding. Countries are taking this partnership to a new level by direct investment. Swaziland now has close to national HIV coverage for adolescent girls and young women. South Africa created a national campaign to take DREAMS beyond the initial five districts to a national-level program leveraging existing st akeholder activities across the country. NOTE: Girls and young women account for around three-quarters of new HIV infections among adolescents in sub-Saharan Africa. SOURCE: PEPFAR, 2017a. A Continued Focus on Data and Metrics Despite the major progress made in addressi ng the HIV/AIDS pandemic, serious barriers prevent ending the pandemic. Most importantly, as noted previous ly, nearly half of all people living with HIV are unaware of th eir status, underscoring the urge ncy of closing the testing gap. Late diagnosis of HIV infection is the most substantial barrier to scaling up HIV treatment (UNAIDS, 2015c), but it also pr esents continuing challenges in keeping the epidemic under control if those who ar e infected are unaware. With the in crease in data collection, PEPFAR has now been able to undertake public health impact assessments in 13 countries to measure progress toward epidemic control, with three completed so far (PEPFAR, 2017a). These public health impact assessments are comprehensive and measur e prevalence, incidence, historic mortality, and service coverage down to the househol d level (PEPFAR, 2016a). Starting in FY2017, Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States ADDRESSING CONTINUOUS THREATS: HIV/AIDS, TUBERCULOSIS, AND MALARIA 4-9 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS PEPFAR will also require implementing partners to provide yearly differe ntiated technical and direct support to sites and patients. New infections still outpace the number of patients on treatment, so HIV prevention, and not just treatment, must be a focus of the next phase of th e program. The pandemic cannot be solved through treatment alone, yet it will play a key role given the significant gains realized through using treatment as pr evention. Recognizing this, PEPFA R increased funding for HIV prevention in young women in 2015 through the DREAMS initiative, expanded voluntary medical circumcision to prevent infections in young men, and in 2017 expanded Prevention for Treatment efforts to decrease transmission in young men (PEPFA R, 2017a). Additionally, with new guidelines from the World Health Organi zation (WHO) on antiretroviral therapy-based prevention, including pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) (WHO, 2016a), PEPFAR is supporting a scale-up of PrEP in key populations, including adolescent girls and youn g women, which is the first time girls have had access to PrEP outside of a research setting. This scale-up is being supported by public-private partnerships such as DREAMS and through Gilead, which is financially supporting purchasing and opera tional expenses for PrEP for young women (PEPFAR, 2017a). However, there is still much to be done to prevent new infections. Prevention requires a comprehensive package that includes behavioral and structur al interventions and condom programming in addition to PrEP, HIV testing, voluntary male circumcision for HIV- negative men, and prevention of mother-to-child tr ansmission, necessitating a varied approach to financing (UNAIDS, 2015c). An estimated $30 billion will be needed to meet the ambitious 90-90-90 targets by 2020 (UNAIDS, 2014a, 2015c); currently, the world is short $19 billion. Moving forward, there is an opportunity to approach the next phase of PE PFAR in a multisectoral and multifaceted manner. Because results vary by country and interventions do not have th e same effectiveness in all places, continued granular-level data colle ction and community-level understanding of community-level epidemics will be critical. Moreove r, broad prevention efforts will need to be implemented at the community level and across sectors\u2014with the suppor t and involvement of country and community leaders\u2014to truly reduce HIV in fection rates. SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATION PEPFAR is in great part res ponsible for the tremendous succ ess achieved in slowing the HIV/AIDS pandemic globally since 2003. In addition to this progress on its primary goal, studies have shown that the countries in which PEPFA R is active had better opinions of the United States (Daschle and Frist, 2015) and also sa w 13 percent increase in employment rates among men compared to non-PEPFAR countries (Wagner et al., 2015). A truly bipa rtisan, collaborative program that has undergone transitions and sh ifts throughout the past 15 years, PEPFAR has shifted its focus from responding to an emerge ncy to sustaining care while targeting at-risk populations, reflecting correspondin g changes in the pandemic. However, the successes achieved should not be taken as a rationale for downscalin g PEPFAR. The need for the program remains: approximately 9.5 million people currently rece ive antiretroviral tr eatment through PEPFAR support, while 2.1 million new HIV infections still occur each year (PEPFAR, 2017). PEPFAR's next phase will continue to require cross-sector and data-driven efforts, as well as strong country partnerships, if the number of ne w HIV infections and AIDS-related deaths is to be dramatically reduced in as many countries as possible by 2030. Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States 4-10 GLOBAL HEALTH AND THE FUTURE ROLE OF THE UNITED STATES PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Conclusion: Now that the pandemic has evolved from requiring an emergency response to requiring a more sustained re sponse, with patient s needing chronic care, the PEPFAR platform needs to evol ve accordingly. Given the substantial reduction in drug costs, the impact of tr eatment on prevention, and the ease of measurement of treatment outcomes, pr ogram ownership needs to shift to countries. At the same time, PEPFAR needs to leverage its existing structures and platforms to address patient and population health issues more comprehensively, while continuing to fulfill th e ethical imperative of prov iding life-saving treatment to those already covered by its programming. Recommendation 4: Envision th e Next Generation of PEPFAR With its next reauthorization, Co ngress should fund the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFA R) at current levels, and allow for more flexibility within the PEPFAR progr am by continuing to relax specific funding targets for all program areas. Continued accountability, efficiency, and measurement of results should be emphasized. In the future, moreover, PEPFAR should focus on the following key areas: Ensure that national governments assu me greater ownership of national HIV/AIDS programs through joint pl anning and decision making, and that they increase domestic funding to help cover the costs of prevention and treatment. Adapt its delivery platform to become more of a cost-effective, chronic care system that is incorporated into each country's health system and priorities. Continue to support the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, and rely on it for specific f unctions where it has the comparative advantage. Such functions could incl ude the Global Fund's efficient procurement of products and multipar tner efforts to encourage countries to transition to domestic sources of funding. Enhance emphasis on primary preventi on through multisector efforts, including strong interventions agains t gender-based violence, given that many new HIV infections are occurring in adolescent girls. TUBERCULOSIS TB, an air-borne disease, has been histori cally underprioritized. Although TB was placed on the international agen da after WHO declared it to be a global emergency in 1993\u2014which only occurred after public health complacency in the 1970s and 1980s led to its resurgence (Ogden et al., 2003)\u2014the world has struggled to reduce the global bu rden of TB, facing significant challenges in tackling the disease in the world's poores t regions. Although the progress made in reducing TB incidence and mo rtality should be celebrated (including an approximate 1.4 to 2.3 percent reduction per year between 2000 and 2015 [WHO, 2016c]), progress has nonetheless been slow. In fact, TB has now surpassed HIV/AIDS as the leading cause of death by an infectious disease worldw ide. In 2015 there were 10.4 million new cases of Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States ADDRESSING CONTINUOUS THREATS: HIV/AIDS, TUBERCULOSIS , AND MALARIA 4-11 PREPUBLICATION COPY: and 1.4 million deaths attributed to TB (WHO, 2016c),11 as opposed to 1.1 million deaths attributed to HIV/ AIDS (UNAIDS, 2016b). TB is truly a global disease, with the hi ghest absolute burden during 2015 being in Southeast Asia, Africa, and the Western Pacific12 (WHO, 2016c). The current global approach on TB is driven by WHO's End TB Strategy, which provides goals for the Sustainable Development Goal era. These goals include achie ving a 95 percent reduction in TB deaths and a 90 percent reduction in TB incidence by 2035. An a dditional goal is reducing the percentage of TB-affected households experien cing catastrophic medical expe nditures to zero by 2030 (WHO, 2016c). Meeting these goals requir es an acceleration of effort, co sting an estimated $8.3 billion in global resources in 2016. Unfortunately, global financing for these goals was 30 percent short of what was required. As a testament to poor in ternational assistance for TB, 84 percent of the $6.6 billion available in 2016 for TB care and prevention in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) came from domestic resources. Weak international support pa rticularly affected national TB programs in low-income countries, which required foreign assistance for about 90 percent of their program funding (WHO, 2016c). Epidemiological Complexity of Tuberculosis This lack of support for TB control is exace rbated by the complexities of TB infection and epidemiology, which become especially proble matic in low-resource settings. First, TB is difficult to diagnose, and the resu lting inadequate case fi nding is an obstacle to global TB control (WHO, 2016c). As a bacterial inf ection with an especially long growth cycle, TB cannot be easily detected with rapid diagnosti c tests as is done for other dis eases relevant to global health. The predominant method for diagnosing TB in LMICs is direct sputum smear microscopy, 13 which is quick but limited in its ability to detect pediatric TB,14 drug-resistant TB, and TB/HIV coinfection (the latter two scussed in later sections) (Des ikan, 2013; Keshavjee and Farmer 2012). Second, treatment length and complexity add to the diagnos tic challenge. Due to the long growth cycle of TB, treatment can often take 6 to 9 months. Furthermore, treatment relies on combination chemotherapy, which uses multiple dr ugs (Laurenzi et al., 2007). Although TB drug regimens are highly effective when provided under strictly regulated clinical trial conditions (above 90 percent)15 (Laurenzi et al., 2007), adherence outside of these settings is lower due to physical barriers to access and le ngthy treatment, which results in average global su ccess rates of about 83 percent (Laurenzi et al., 2007; WHO, 2016c). 11 An additional 0.39 millions deaths in 2015 were caused by HIV/TB coinfection. 12 A reason Southeast Asia an d Africa rank so high is that China, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, Pakistan, and South Africa accounted for 60 percent of new cases in 2015 (WHO, 2016c). 13 Direct sputum smear microscopy uses laboratory techniques to analyze a sample of sputum (a mixture of fluids coughed up from the respiratory tract) for the TB bacteria (Singhal and My needu, 2015). Serial samples may be required to confirm TB diagnoses, but many patients may fa il to appear for a follow-up appointment, often due to an inability to afford repeat visits to a health fa cility (Harries et al., 1998; Kemp et al., 2007). 14 Because of limitations of direct sputum smear microsco py among children, pediatric TB is often called a \"hidden epidemic,\" an issue that is worsen ed by lack of treatment options. 15 The studies referenced are clinical trials conducted in the United States and the United Kingdom, settings that do not apply to everyday circumstances in LMICs.

All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States 4-12 GLOBAL HEALTH AND THE FUTURE ROLE OF THE UNITED STATES PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis Poor adherence to TB treatment has resulted in a rapid increase of monoresistant multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB), and recognized in 1948, drug-resistant TB steadily grew but was more or less ignored (similar to nonresistant TB) until the early 1990s (Nachega and Chaisson, 2003). This lack of attention was partly driven by the emergence of combination chemotherapy in the mid-1900s, which led to the belief that TB would be conquered, and consequen tly resulted in the elimination of federal funding for TB control in the United States by 1972 (Cegielski, 2010). Similarly, funding for TB research dropped to just $514,000 in the United St ates in 1979 (Petrakos, 1993). Just as TB resurged during the 1970s and 1980s, so too did MDR-TB, with outbreaks in multiple U.S. states 17 (Cegielski, 2010; Petrakos, 1993) and epid emics reported across the globe (Cegielski, 2010). In 2015 alone there were approximately 480,000 new cases of MDR-TB, 9.5 percent of which were XDR-TB cases. Furthermore, 3.9 pe rcent of all new TB cases in 2015 were MDR- TB cases (WHO, 2016c). While these numbers seem small, they may underestimate the true burden of drug-resistant bacteria as the method for determining resistance (sputum culture) can take up to 6 weeks (CDC, 2013) and requires sophisti cated laboratory capacity that is lacking in many LMICs. The rise of drug resistance is a blow to gl obal TB control efforts, as monoresistant TB and MDR-TB also can be spread from person to person (CDC, 2016b). It was previously thought that XDR-TB only was acquired due to repeated treatment failure. However, recent findings indicate that even XDR-TB can be spread from person to person (Shah et al., 2017). To make matters worse, length of treatment for these drug-resistant strains is even longer\u2014up to 20 months 18\u2014and their success rates even lower: 52 pe rcent for MDR-TB and 28 percent for XDR- TB (WHO, 2016c). Low treatment success rates make XDR-TB especially lethal, with the long- term chances of survival being only 15 per cent (Pietersen et al ., 2014). Although preventing these resistant strains is vital from a security standpoint, it is also very cost-effective. The cost to treat TB ranges from $100 to $500 per person in LMICs, yet the costs for treating MDR-TB and XDR-TB can reach up to $10,000 and $26,000, respectiv ely (Laurence et al., 2015; al., Pooran et al., 2013). TB/HIV Coinfection The frequent coinfection of TB with HIV pos es another epidemiological challenge. In fact, the risk of developing TB is 26 to 31 tim es greater for those who have HIV/AIDS than those who do not (WHO, 2017b). In 2015, a third of those living with HIV were infected with TB, and of the 10.4 million new cases of TB, 1.2 million occurred in people living with HIV (WHO, 2016c). Furthermore, for those living with HIV in resource-poor settings, TB is the largest single cause of death (UNAIDS, 2016b) , accounting for 34.45 percent of HIV deaths.19 Coinfection has been found to re sult in a dangerous interaction in the body, with HIV being linked to the progression of a TB infection a nd TB being reported to worsen HIV infection (Getahun et al., 2010; Whalen et al., 1995). Further exacerbati ng this issue is that HIV 16 Monoresistant TB is TB that is resistant to one TB drug . MDR-TB is TB that is resistant to at least two commonly used TB drugs. XDR-TB is TB that is resistant to two or more first-line drugs in addition to at least two second-line drugs used to treat MD R-TB (WHO, 2012a). 17 New York City alone spent more than $1 billion to curb a TB epidemic in the early 1990s (Frieden et al., 1995). 18 New WHO recommendations have shortened regimens for MDR-TB to 9-12 months. 19 This percentage is derived from dividing the number of HIV deaths due to TB (0.39 million) by the total number of HIV-related deaths (1.1 million) in 2015 (UNAIDS, 2016b).

The mainstay of TB treatment is the directly observed treatment short-course strategy (DOTS),20 which was adopted by WHO in the mid- 1990s largely as a branding strategy for global TB control. The evidence for the eff ectiveness of short-course therapy, which served as the foundation of DOTS, was limited to Ma lawi, Mozambique, and Tanzania in a 1991 study (Ogden et al., 2003). By 2001, 127 countries had adopted the DOTS policy (WHO, 2001). The logic behind DOTS is that through direct obs ervation treatment failure would occur less frequently. However, meta-analyses of the lit erature have shown that DOTS (the directly observed component) is no more effective than se lf-administration of tr eatment (Karumbi and Garner, 2015; Pasipanodya and Gumbo, 2013). Given the resource intensiveness of direc tly observed treatment and its relative ineffectiveness compared to self-administration, policy makers need to reconsider TB control strategies and a redirect ion of resources toward other causes of poor treatment outcomes. As TB is a disease of poverty, one opti on could be targeting the social determinants of TB, which include social circumstances and material res ources, misunderstandings of the etiology of TB, stigma, fear of punitive sanctions due to a posi tive TB diagnosis, and a lack of social support during treatment (Noyes and Popay, 2007). Howe ver, this option w ould not target the fundamental problems that LMICs face in dia gnosing TB and its drug-resistant strains and managing the complexities of treatment. Addres sing these issues would require a substantial investment in TB diagnostics and drugs. Research and Development for Tuberculosis Diagnostics and Drugs Development of new diagnostic tools for TB has seen some progress. The most notable example is the GeneXpert molecular test, wh ich can detect monoresistant, specifically Rifampicin-resistant, TB strains within 2 hours (Lawn et al., 2013; Sharma et al., 2015). Although this tool is highly accurate and has the potential to improve the accuracy and speed of TB diagnosis, it is also costly, which poses a hurdle for its implementation. WHO endorsement of the GeneXpert tool has resulted in donor suppor t, but sustaining its use will fall to national governments. Regardless, rapid diag nostic tests are urgently needed to combat TB (Lawn et al., 2013). Similar to diagnostics, the development of new TB drugs also is needed to improve the outcomes of TB therapy in terms of shorteni ng the length and improving therapy for MDR-TB and XDR-TB. Unfortunately, the ne w TB drug pipeline is almost empty. Only two new TB drugs (bedaquiline and delamanid) have been approved to treat MDR-TB, which marks the first time in more than 50 years that a new drug has been approved for this use (Zumla et al., 2015). Though 16 additional drugs are in preclinical and clinical development (Zumla et al., 2015), research and development for TB drugs is particularly complex due to the need to esta blish efficacy of a new agent in the context of combination therapy, whic h can make the clinical phase of development last up to two decades (Ginsberg and Spigel man, 2007). Streamlining the development of TB drugs will require novel research strategies, possibly including the use of biomarkers (discussed in Chapter 7). 20 Though DOTS contains five elements (sustained political and financial commitment, diagnosis by quality-ensured sputum smear microscopy, standardized short-course anti-TB treatment given under direct and supportive observation, a regular supply of high-quality anti-TB drugs, and standardized recording an d reporting), it is mostly known for its direct observation of treatment.

Global TB funding has increased since then, and the United Stat es is now the largest international funder for TB, with its bilateral progra ms reaching more than 50 countries (KFF, 2017b). Since the initiation of its TB program, the U.S. government has contributed to the gains made against TB, saving 37 million lives between 2000 and 2013 (U SAID, 2015). The current U.S. policy for global TB is guided by the Global Tuberculosis Strategy: 2015-2019, which assigns clear roles to U.S. government agencies for TB activities. USAID is designated as the lead agency in international TB control, including MDR-TB21 and XDR-TB; PEPFAR is established as the lead actor for U.S. government response to TB/HIV coinfection; CDC is responsible for providing technical support (surveillance a nd laboratory networks) to mini stries of health and U.S. agencies, in addition to conducti ng operational research; and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases is res ponsible for U.S. international TB-related research (USAID, 2015). However, the current strategy failed to design ate a single entity to direct and coordinate resources. This U.S. TB strategy mirrors WHO' s End TB Strategy and has ambitious goals of achieving a 95 percent reduction in TB deaths and a 90 percent reduction in TB incidence by 2035 (USAID, 2015). The U.S. government has also created an MDR-TB-specific strategy, the National Action Plan for Combating Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis,22 which emphasizes improving access to diagnostics and treatment in ternationally and accelerating research and development for MDR-TB (White House, 2015). Unfortunately, U.S. funding for global TB has not been commensurate with its ambitious goals. Despite $4 billion being authorized under the 2008 Lantos-Hyde Act for FY2009-FY2013 for global TB programs, only 40 percent ever became appropriated (Nieburg and Jackson, 2016) in recent years, and the TB budget has hovered around $230-$240 million annually (KFF, 2017b). However, funding was contracted in th e FY2017 budget request for TB, which was only $195 million, a 19 percent decrease from FY2016 (KFF, 2017a). Although this decrease in funding could be particularly de trimental for low-income countri es that rely on international donors for 90 percent of their national TB program financing (WHO, 2016c), it is symptomatic of a broader issue: an underprior itization of TB. Underp rioritization is not a sustainable course of action, as it will threaten gains made in key U.S. programs, particularly PEPFAR. Figure 4-1 displays those countries that have a high burden for TB, MDR-TB, and TB/HIV in the center diamond. Of the 14 countries listed, 11 are PE PFAR-supported countries. PEPFAR has allocated an average of $138 million toward integrated TB /HIV treatment programs, but this amounts to only 3 percent of its expenditures (Morrison an d Neiburg, 2014). If additional resources and operational changes are not directed toward this need, PEPFAR coul d lose hard-won gains in the clinical management of HIV (IOM, 2013). To meet the goals set in the cu rrent U.S. strategy for TB, a fundamental rethinking is needed regard ing the treatment programs deployed, the social interventions used, and the investment in resear ch and development for diagnostics and drugs. 21 USAID has recently entered into a partnership with Janssen, the company that developed bedaquiline, to guarantee that the company's donations of the MDR-TB drug are implemented effectively into treatment programs in its partner countries (USAID, 2016). 22 The National Action Plan was developed in response to President Obama's Ex ecutive Order 13676 and creates an interagency collaboration between USAID, PEPFAR, CDC, the National Institutes of Health, and the U.S. Department of Defense. It also includes specific goals to curb the burden of MDR- TB in the United States. Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

In fact, between 2000 and 2015, there was only a 1.4 percent reduction per year in the global incidence of TB and a 2.3 percent reduction per year in global mortality from the disease (WHO, 2016c). TB caused 1.4 million deaths in 2015, thus surpassing HIV/AIDS as the leading cause of death due to an infectious disease. Further complicating global efforts is a rise in dr ug resistance, with 3.9 percent of all new TB cases being drug- resistant. Treatment for TB, MDR-TB, and XDR -TB is lengthy and complex, and frequently fails. Furthermore, treatment for MDR-TB and XDR-TB can cost up to 100 times as much as treatment for nonresistant TB (L aurence et al., 2015; Nieburg et al., 2015; Pooran et al., 2013). With few drugs available to treat these resistan t strains and little rese arch and development on new treatment options, TB and its drug-resistant strains pose a grow ing threat to the health and health security of all countries, including the Un ited States. Yet while TB has been a priority for the United States and was a focal point in a 2015 National Action Plan for Combating MDR-TB, it has been underprioritized fi nancially. Of the $4 billion auth orized over 5 years under the 2008 Lantos-Hyde Act to implement the strategy, only 40 percent was ever appropriated, with the most recent budget request being reduced even furt her than previous years to just $195 million (KFF, 2017a; Nieburg and Jackson, 2016). Conclusion: The threat of TB has been rising in recent decades, and levels of funding have been far short of the am ounts needed to address this threat adequately. There are very few drugs or vaccines for TB in the development pipeline, and the growing number of resistant strains will make this threat even more alarming and complex to address if su fficient action is not taken. The U.S. government's underprioritization of TB undercuts its capability to reduce the burden of TB. Given that current strate gies for combating the disease are not keeping pace with its burden and complexity, the U.S. government needs to significantly reevaluate its investment in and strategies for dealing with TB. Recommendation 5: Confront the Threat of Tuberculosis The U.S. Centers for Disease Control a nd Prevention, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and the U.S. Agency for International Development should conduct a thorough global threat assessment of rising tuberculosis (TB) levels, including multidrug-resistant TB and extensively drug-resistant TB. They should then execute a plan of action, including governance structure and priority activiti es, for developing and investing in new diagnostics, drugs, vacci nes, and delivery systems. MALARIA Malaria, one of the world's most widespread parasitic diseases, pl aces approximately 3.2 billion people at risk of infec tion at all times (CDC, 2016c) and resulted in 212 million new cases and 429,000 deaths in 2015 (WHO, 2016d). The WHO African region faces the highest global burden, with 90 percent of cases and 92 pe rcent of deaths. Furthermore, malaria Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States ADDRESSING CONTINUOUS THREATS: HIV/AIDS, TUBERCULOSIS , AND MALARIA 4-17 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS disproportionately affects the poorest and most vulnerable populati ons (WHO, 2014), which includes pregnant women, infants, and children under 5 years old (WHO, 2017a). In fact, more than 69 percent of malaria deaths worldwide in 2015 were children under the age of 5 (WHO, 2017a), with a child dying ever y 30 seconds. Malaria also poses an economic burden both to families and endemic countries. Families can lose more than one quarter of their income due to treatment costs and lost days of work, and ma laria costs the African region upward of $12 billion each year in lost productivity (European A lliance against Malaria, 2007; UNICEF, 2004). Global Commitment to Malaria Although efforts to control malaria date back to the 19th century, true global commitment began in 1955 when WHO formed the Global Ma laria Eradication Prog ram (GMEP), which had ambitious goals to interrupt malaria transmission in all endemic areas, with the exception of sub- Saharan Africa. GMEP's expansive efforts resu lted in 143 malaria-endemic countries becoming classified as malaria free in 1978 (N\u00e1jera, 2001; RBM, 2011). However, public support waned throughout the 1960s, which resulted in tighteni ng of financial resources for global malaria control. Global support for GMEP became offi cially withdrawn at the 22nd World Health Assembly in 1969 (N\u00e1jera et al., 2011). The l ack of public support a nd financial resources resulted in worldwide resurgence of mala ria during the 1980s (RBM, 2011). The resurgence contributed to malaria climbing back up the global agenda, forma lized with the launch of the Roll Back Malaria (RBM) partne rship in 1998 and the adoption of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in 2000. The political commitme nt and subsequent influx of funding have contributed to remarkable gains in malari a control. Between 2000 and 2015, 57 countries achieved the MDG of reducing the number of ne w malaria cases by at least 75 percent (WHO, 2015a). At the same time, the global incidence of malaria declined by 41 percent and global malaria mortality rates declined by 62 percent (WHO, 2016d). Global Financing of Malari a Control and Elimination The progress made toward malaria control and elimination since the turn of the century was possible in large part due to increases in financial support, which grew from under $100 million in 2000 (WHO, 2013) to $2.9 billion in 2015 (WHO, 2016d). Despite these increases, global funding for malaria still fa lls 46 percent short of the $6.4 billion needed to achieve the 2020 goals established by WHO's Global Technical Strategy. In 2015 the majority (68 percent) of funding for global malaria was provided by mu ltilateral and bilatera l programs, with The Global Fund accounting for nearly 45 percent of a ll international assistan ce. The United States continues to be the single larges t international funder for malari a, accounting for approximately 35 percent of total malaria funding in 2015, incl uding both the Presiden t's Malaria Initiative (PMI) and contributions to th e Global Fund (WHO, 2016d). The remaining 32 percent of funding was provided by governments of endemic countries . Although investing in malaria may seem costly, the cost - benefit analysis modeling the e ffect of global malaria reduction and elimination found that the net gains in economic output w ould be worth $208.6 billion (Purdy et al., 2013). These gains would positively affect internati onal travelers and endemi c populations alike. Malaria Elimination and Shrinking the Malaria Map The success of global malaria programs has ra ised interest in the concept of malaria elimination, or the reduction of incidence of locally acquired malaria infecti on to zero as a result Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States 4-18 GLOBAL HEALTH AND THE FUTURE ROLE OF THE UNITED STATES PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS of deliberate efforts. This has become a fo cal point of WHO's Globa l Technical Strategy 2016- 2030 and RBM's Action and Investment to De feat Malaria 2016-2030. Both of these programs inform the current global malaria strategy, whic h uses 2015 as a baseline and has the goal of reducing malaria mortality and incidence by 40 percent and eliminating malaria from 10 countries by 2020. The final target of the global malaria agenda is to reduce malaria mortality and incidence by 90 percent and eliminate ma laria from 35 countries by 2030 (RBM, 2015; WHO, 2015b). Elimination now is considered to be a realistic goal. In fact, between 2007 and 2013 alone, four countries have been declared ma laria free (Newby et al., 2016). At the core of elimination is the idea of \"shrinking the malaria ma p,\" which stipulates that as the incidence of malaria is reduced at its natural borders,23 reducing incidence\u2014and thereby achieving elimination\u2014becomes easier in the endemic h eartland (Feachem and MEG, 2009; Feachem and Sabot, 2008). That 35 countries have made politic al commitments toward malaria elimination serves as a testament to its feasibility (New by et al., 2016). Challenges Malaria has suffered from the \"out of sight, out of mind\" perspective. Past investments in malaria led to reduced deaths, costs, and illness for millions, yet as discussed in Chapter 3, relaxation of mosquito control efforts in several countries resulted in a re surgence of the disease. A severe example occurred in Venezuela, which had eliminated malaria in 1961\u2014one of the first countries to do so (WHO, 2012b)\u2014but experienced a resurgence recently due to its collapsing economy and relaxation of spraying interventions . In addition to maintaining coverage of interventions, it is vital for the global commun ity to maintain a vigilant eye on the growing challenge of drug resistance. As explained in the next paragraph, count ries have begun to observe strains of malaria resist ant to baseline therapy. If thes e strains are not contained, they threaten global successes in cont rolling and eliminating malaria. The epicenter of drug resist ance is the Greater Mekong subregion in Southeast Asia, 24 but it could spread to India and Afri ca (where the largest burden lies) if governme nts, funders, and program implementers do not maintain vi gilance (Hanboonkunupakarn and White, 2016). In addition to treatment resistance, insecticide resistance has also grown. Although insecticide control relies on four classes of compounds,25 the pyrethroids are the most commonly used but unfortunately have the most wi despread resistance\u2014an issue that especially threatens sub- Saharan Africa (Hemingway et al., 2016; WHO, 2016d). The growing challenge of both types of resistance poses a significant obstacle toward the integrated manageme nt of malaria. Unless commitment is maintained and new tools and strate gies are developed, further resistance is likely to spread. 23 The endemic borders of malaria depend on a country's latitude, altitude, and climate. The edges of these borders have lower probability of reintroduction. 24 The Greater Mekong subregion, which comprises Cambodia, China (Yunnan Province), Lao PDR, and Myanmar (Burma), experiences multidrug resistance and insecticide re sistance. Due to its geographical heterogeneity and the presence of multiple malaria parasites, the region is noto riously complex for malaria control and elimination. As a result, the Greater Mekong subregion is considered to be one of the most dangerous foci of malaria in Southeast Asia (Cui et al., 2012; WHO, 2016a). 25 The four classes of insecticides are organochlorides, organophosphates, carbamates, and pyrethroids (WHO, 2016d).

Corporate investments in malaria, which range from direct financing of interventions, to supply-chai n strengthening, to workforce cap acity support, occur through two approaches: (1) protecting employees and opera tional site communities and (2) forming broad partnerships with national progr ams (Brieger, 2013). The majority of direct financing and in-kind donations for malaria have been provided by the oil/gas and minerals industries. For example, ExxonMobil donated $500,000 to establish a malaria diagnostic laboratory in the HopeXchange Medical Center in Kumasi, Ghana (Menka, 2011), and it has also contributed to reducing malaria cases among workers through a chemoprophylaxis co mpliance testing program (Diara et al., 2012). AngloGold Ashanti developed its own ma laria control program focused on indoor spraying in the Obuasi District in Ghana in 2005 that contributed to a 74 percent reduction in malaria cases (Brieger, 2013). Similarly, Kinr oss Gold Corporation launched a $3.2 million 4- year malaria program in the western region of Gh ana to provide vector co ntrol interventions and treatment services that resulted in a 45 percen t reduction of malaria incidence in the community (Stiles-Ocran, 2013). Although multinational companies may have made such investments in isolation at first, now they often invest in coordination through involvement with the Global Business Coalition for Health, which has three key initiatives: lead ing the Corporate Allian ce on Malaria in Africa, which has a membership of 15 companies (CAM A, 2016); serving as the focal point for The Global Fund's Private Sector Delegation (G BCHealth, 2014b); and the Private Sector Constituency of RBM (GBCHealth, 2014a). Because of their affiliation with the Global Business Coalition for Health, member organizations of the Corporate Alliance on Malaria in Africa have a unique interface with the global malaria spa ce. Many of these corporate investments are examples of both social goals and corporate goal s being achieved. For diseases such as malaria, which have commitment from multiple angles across the global landscape and can provide opportunity for private-sector involvement both to address th e disease burden and help corporations' bottom line, the committee sees a continuing and important role for the private sector in this next st age of global health. President's Malaria Initiative As noted, the United States is the single larg est international funder for malaria, and in 2016 contributed $861 million for global malaria contro l, with the majority of the activities being conducted by PMI. Launched in 2005 to assist a set of 15 focus countries that had a high burden of malaria (PMI, 2017a), PMI is directed by the Global Malaria Coordinator within USAID. PMI now provides surveillance, prev ention, treatment, research, an d health system- strengthening services to 20 partner countri es in Africa and Southeast Asia (PMI, 2017a). Through a focus on four key proven interventions,26 PMI has been able to contribute to a global decline of malaria 26 PMI focuses on four proven interventions: indoor residual spraying, artemisinin-based combination therapy, insecticide-treated mosquito nets and long-lasting insec ticide-treated nets, and intermittent preventative treatment for pregnant women (PMI, 2016a). As PMI's approach is focused on achieving results, almost 50 percent of its funding is directed toward purchasing these commodities, in cluding rapid diagnostic tests (Simon et al., 2011). In 2015 alone, PMI procured more than 42 million long-l asting insecticide-treated nets, conducted indoor residual spraying on more than 4 million houses (protecting more than 16 million people), conducted more than 21 million Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States 4-20 GLOBAL HEALTH AND THE FUTURE ROLE OF THE UNITED STATES PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS mortality by 48 percent, a decline of malaria cas es by 37 percent, and an avoidance of 6.2 million deaths of children under five in sub-Saharan Africa (PMI, 2016b). From many accounts, PMI is considered a successful program not only because of its coordination with global partners, but also because of its strong interagency coordination (Simon et al., 2011). Unlike PEPFAR, PMI was launche d when the global community had already established a framework for global malaria control and strong institutions, such as RBM and The Global Fund, were already in existence. Thus, PMI was never meant to lead the global response to malaria but rather had donor coordination as a key priority at its inception (Simon et al., 2011). In fact, PMI's decision to pa rtner with its initial 15 focus countries was made because The Global Fund had functioning grants in place (Simon et al., 2011). PMI has also been successful in coordinating the interagency27 programs involved in global malaria control. Although this success is par tly due to the leadership of the Global Malaria Coordinator, which has been Admiral Timothy Ziem er since PMI's inception, it is also due to the mechanism by which funding is allocated to the agencies involved (Simon et al., 2011). PMI funding decisions start at the count ry level, where a detailed mala ria operation plan is prepared for each year of funding that describes what inputs and activities a national malaria program needs to reach targets. Each malaria operation plan covers the four priority interventions, but the balance among them is determined by the loca l epidemiology of malaria. After a malaria operation plan is reviewed by the PMI leadership,28 funds are moved to the implementation level. The process by which this occurs improves the in teragency coordination, as allocations are made not only based on the needs of the country but also on the capability of each partner.29 Thus, just as with PEPFAR, much of PMI's su ccesses can be linked to the influence of its \"presidential\" aspect, showing how effective U. S. government programs can be when there is political commitment at the highe st level of government, clear targets are set, and agency responsibility and authority are clearly designated. SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATION Remarkable progress has been made in reve rsing the tide of malaria. From 2000 to 2015, the global community was able to reduce the numb er of deaths due to malaria by 62 percent and the incidence of the disease by 41 percent (WHO, 2016e). This progress has been possible in large part as a result of increases in gl obal programmatic and fi nancial support\u2014from $100 million in 2000 to $2.9 billion in 2015 (WHO, 2013; 2016e). As a result, elimination of malaria has become a realistic goal, with many countri es not only making commitments to elimination but also declaring themselves malaria-free. Much of this progress has been possible through U.S. support, notably through the PMI, which has been praised for its ability to coordinate the interagency response to global ma laria; collaborate w ith global partners; and, most important, deliver results. However, malaria still imposes a major burden of disease, with 212 million cases intermittent preventative treatments for pregnant women, and administered more than 57 million artemisinin-based combination therapies and 54 million rapid diagnostic tests (PMI, 2016a). 27 PMI is housed within USAID and coordinates both US AID and CDC for implementing programs. However, it is overseen by an Interagency Advisory Group comprising representatives from USAID, CDC and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the U.S. Department of State, the U.S. Department of Defense, the National Security Council, and the Office of Management and Budget (PMI, 2017a). 28 The leadership involved with the malaria operation plan review is the PMI Interagenc y Technical Working Group, the PMI Coordinator, and the PMI Interagency Steering Group (Simon et al., 2011). 29 Personal communication with Michael Miller, The Kyle House Group, November 11, 2016.

Furthermore, the global community is witnessing a rise in ma laria's resistance to drugs and insecticides, which threatens the hard-won gains that ha ve been achieved. Conclusion: As a result of the continuing threat of malaria, it is vital for the United States to remain engaged in th e global fight against the disease. The President's Malaria Initiative (PMI) progr am has been highly successful within the U.S. Agency for International Developm ent under the leade rship of the PMI coordinator. The committee concludes that PMI is a well-designed interagency model that warrants continuous and sustainable funding. Recommendation 6: Sustain Progre ss Toward Malaria Elimination Relevant agencies of the U.S. government should continue their commitment to the fight against malaria through th e President's Malaria Initiative and collaborative work with all partners toward elimination of the disease. PUBLIC HEALTH COMPLACE NCY AND RESISTANCE: A RATIONALE FOR CONT INUED INVESTMENT There is no doubt that gains have been ma de against HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria. Because of the investments by the United States and the global community, HIV is no longer necessarily a death sentence for th e poorest in the world, millions of deaths due to TB have been averted, and malaria elimination has become a real possibility for many countries. Maintaining programmatic and financial commitment toward these diseases is vital if these gains are to be sustained. All too often, a re duction of the burden can resu lt in complacency and cause prioritization to subside. Lapses in commitment occurred with both TB and malaria in the mid- 1900s, followed by outbreaks and resurgence of bot h diseases worldwide in the 1980s. These disastrous results were incredibly expensive to reverse, especially for TB. New York City alone spent $1 billion to curb a TB epidemic in the 199 0s (Frieden et al., 1993). The ability of these diseases to rebound should serve as a cautionary tale for public health vigilance and as a rationale for continued U.S. investments in PEPFAR, global TB control, and PMI. HIV/AIDS has thus far not suffered from this cycle of neglect and panic. However, if interest wanes, it is likely that resurgence of HIV will also occur, a predictable but avoidable result. With 9.5 million people directly benefitti ng from PEPFAR-provided antiretroviral therapy in 2015, and many more secondarily benefitting through decreased rates of HIV transmission, a decrease in PEPFAR funding could be disastro us to the communities that PEPFAR serves. PEPFAR acknowledged this possibility in its 2016 Annual Report to Congress , noting that countries like Uganda demonstrate how easily pr ogress can be reversed if continual focus and pandemic control efforts are not maintained (PEPFAR, 2016a). In addition to the risk of resurgence, sustai ned involvement is important to contain the spread of antimicrobial resistance. As discussed in the previous s ections, resistance has created a global emergency for TB and significantly threaten s the progress of integrated malaria control. As national borders become more porous and globa lization increases global travel, coordination among neighboring countries becomes vital to contain resistance. This need is most apparent for malaria, as indicated by the massive efforts by PM I and global partners to contain artemisinin Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

If resistance in this region were to spread to nearby countries, such as India, or the African continent, progress to ward global malaria control effo rts could be not only halted but also reversed (Cui et al., 2012) . This concern goes beyond just nei ghboring countries as well, as four patients in the United Kingdom recently reco rded failure of frontline drug treatment after returning home from vi siting countries in Africa in 2015-2016 (UCLH, 2017). To finish the work that began decades ago and build the capacity of so many countries, it is important to address the th ree unfinished agendas for HIV/AI DS, TB, and malaria. However, this rise in resistance for all three diseases threatens the completion of these agendas. Although recent advancements in research and developm ent, such as bedaquiline for MDR-TB, are praiseworthy, a sustained, concerte d effort to contain resistance is crucial to ensure that the global community's hard-won gains are not lost. Public health complacency has reversed progress in the past. If the United States and its partners do not want to see history repeat itself, then a continued investment in the agendas of HIV, TB, and mala ria is imperative.

Despite these be nefits, glaring gaps must still be filled to reduce the mortality rate , provide equitable access to quality health care among women and children, and improve outcomes for children who survive past the age of 5. Because healthy women and children are the lin chpin for healthy and thriving societies (see Figure 5-1), investing in the hea lth of women and children is indi spensable to achieving the new Sustainable Development Goals (S DGs) agenda. In low- and middl e-income countries (LMICs), providing more education for child ren, especially girls, can resu lt in greater accumulation of human capital, increased productivity, and in creased income and economic development (UNICEF, 2015). In an analysis of multiple countries, a clear correlation was noted between average years of education and poverty rates: fo r each additional year of education among young adults ages 25-34, national poverty rates were 9 percent lower (UNICEF, 2015). Similarly, a study in Botswana found that each additional year of secondary schooling reduced cumulative human immunodeficiency virus (H IV) infection risk by 8.1 percen t (De Neve et al., 2015). Based on such evidence for the connect ion between education and hea lth, The Global Fund and other HIV and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) organizat ions have even shown an interest in developing incentives to keep girls in school. The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief's (PEPFAR's) Determined, Resilien t, Empowered, AIDS-free, Mentored, and Safe women (DREAMS) program, explored in Chapte r 4, highlights education key to reducing HIV infections in adolescent girls and young women. In addition to the education benefits for young adults, children born to more educated mothers are better off financially and are more likely to receiv e vaccines and rehydration, sleep under insecticide-treated bed nets , and have other good health inte rventions available to them. Countries where women hold more than 30 percent of seats in political bo dies are shown to be more inclusive, equitable, and democratic (USA ID, 2015). The benefits of investment in women and children will extend beyond health and tran slate into increased economic prosperity, strengthened societal bonds, and improved commun ity resilience. These benefits make it a wise investment opportunity for the United States. This chapter begins by discussing the shift of the global development agenda related to women and children, from the unfinished Mill ennium Development Goals (MDGs) to the multidisciplinary SDGs, and the current state of their health with a focus on mortality rates. Next, it reviews the current efforts in this area, including those of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), World Heal th Organization (WHO), and Global Financing Facility (GFF). The chapter then goes through th e key themes of the WHO strategy, with a focus on \"Survive, Thrive, and Transform, \" and highlights where gaps still remain in addressing health issues for women and children, and what can be done to accomplish the re lated targets of the SDGs over the next 15 years.

Global rates of maternal mortality were also reduced by nearly 50 percent between 1990 and 2015, from 385 to 216 deaths per 100,000 live births, wi th most of the reduction happe ning since 2000 (Kassebaum et al., 2016). Part of this reduction ca n be attributed to the rise in skilled birth attendants: in 2014, skilled personnel assisted in 71 percent of birt hs globally, which is an increase from 59 percent in 1990 (UN, 2015d). In spite of this progress, none of the maternal and child health-related goals were met by the time the MDGs expired in 2015, and now the obj ectives remain a critical unfinished agenda (UN, 2015c,d). The approach to global development has since evolved, shifting in focus to the more cross-sector SDGs. As discussed in Chap ter 2, the SDGs were designed to cut across sectors to advance progress more quickly and achieve new global targets by 2030 by attacking issues comprehensively (UN, 2015a). SDG 3\u2014ens ure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages\u2014has three targets pertaining directly to women's and children's health: 1. Reduce the global maternal mortality ratio from the current rate, which is 216 maternal deaths for every 100,000 live births (UN, 2015a), to <70 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births. 2. End preventable deaths of newborns and ch ildren under 5 years of age in all countries mortality: maximum 12/1,000 live births; under-5 mortality: maximum 25/1,000 live births) (UN, 2015a). 3. Ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive health care services, including family planning, information, and educa tion, and the integration of reproductive health into national strategies and programs. CURRENT STATE OF WOMEN's AND CHILDREN'S HEALTH Despite the tremendous strides made in reduc ing the deaths of women and children, 5.9 million children still die each year before their fifth birthday (WHO, 2016a), with 4.5 million of these dying in their first year of life (WHO, n.d.-a). The vast majority of these deaths are preventable as they are caused by preterm bi rth complications, pneumonia, and intrapartum- related events (e.g., birth asphyxia) (Liu et al., 2016). Infants and young children who live in LMICs experience a greater risk of death than their peers in wealthier countries and children living in poverty experience a greater risk of poor development. At least 250 million children (43 percent) under 5 years of age in LMICs suffer from suboptimal development, which has substantial short- and long-term negative consequences. Th ese consequences include poorer health in childhood and later in life, lower edu cational attainment, poorer school performance, less social integration, and lowe r earning power (estimates suggest that 25 percent of average adult income is lost per yea r) (Black et al., 2017). These c onsequences contribute to the perpetuation of poverty and can result in a count ry's forfeiting up to twice its current gross domestic product (GDP) expenditure on health (R ichter et al., 2017). In addition, more than 50 percent of the almost 60 million displaced people, or refugees, documented in 2014 were children\u2014many under 5 years old (Edwards, 2016). The violent and austere environments in which these children live have grave effects on their developmental trajectories and stress response systems, which in turn influence th eir physical, social, and emotional health. Almost all (99 percent) of the 303,000 women who die annually from causes related to pregnancy and childbirth die in LMICs (WHO, 2 016d). Most of these deaths are preventable Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

The maternal mortalit y rate in LMICs is 14 times higher than in high-income countries, in part because only half the women in LMICs receive adequate health care (GFF, 2016). However, high maternal mortality is not a problem isolated to LMICs or countries receiving financial assist ance. The rate of maternal deaths in the United States jumped from 17.5 per 100,000 live births in 2000 to 26.4 in 2015 (Kassebaum et al., 2016). Texas recorded an even higher jump, from 18 maternal deaths per 1 00,000 live births in 2000 to more than 30 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2014 (MacDorman et al., 2016). These maternal mortality rates put the United States squarely in line with middle- income countries such as Chile, Mexico, and Turkey\u2014clearly highlighting pregnanc y- and childbirth-relate d maternal deaths as an area that would benefit from shared invest ment with other countri es to achieve common solutions for improvement. CURRENT EFFORTS TO PROMOTE WOMEN AND CHILDREN'S HEALTH The concept of investing in the well-being of women and children is not new, and many organizations have already begun ta iloring their programs to specifi cally address the health needs of women and children based on th e evidence and successes of others . Below is a brief review of the women and children's health activities of a fe w key organizations engaged in global efforts to promote women and children's health. U.S. Agency for International Development In 2014, USAID's report Acting on the Call: Ending Preventable Maternal and Child Deaths operationalized the U.S. government strate gy on maternal and ch ild health (USAID, 2016). The aim of USAID's Ending Preventable Maternal and Ch ild Deaths (EPMCD) program is to save the lives of 15 million children and 600,000 mothers by 2020 in 24 priority countries (USAID, 2016). To reach this goal, USAID's investments focus on the provision of routine immunizations; equity of care for childhood illnesse s such as malaria, pneumonia, and diarrhea; family planning; maternal and newborn health; nutrition; and water, sanitation, and hygiene. Scaling up coverage of 11 of these innovations wa s projected to prevent up to 6 million maternal and child deaths (PATH, 2016). In 2016, total funding for the EPMCD program was $2.4 billion (USAID, 2016). Between 2012 and 2015, the average annu al rate of reducti on of under-5 deaths was 3.6 percent, which is short of the 4.1 percen t required to meet the original MDG target. Furthermore, as of 2016, only 19 countries were on track to achieve the SDG's under-5 mortality target by 2030 (USAID, 2016). Given these findings, the committee sees an opportunity for USAID to accelerate implementation of the EPMCD program to achieve unfinished maternal and child health MDG targets by 2020 and under-5 targets by 2030. Strategies should focus on ensuring the highest impact thr ough scaling innovative approaches , with rigorous monitoring and evaluation, with a focus on immunization; integrat ed management of child illness, nutrition, and prenatal care; and increasing access to c ontraceptives, including family planning. World Health Organization A new global agenda, WHO's Global Strategy for Wo men's, Children's, and Adolescents' Health (2016-2030) , aims to support countries in finishing the unfinished MDG Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States INVESTING IN WOMEN'S AND CHILDREN'S HEALTH 5-5 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS targets (WHO, 2016b). WHO's Global Strategy adopts a life-course perspective guided by a cross-cutting three-part framework: survive, thrive, and transform.1 Several of the Global Strategy goals overlap with the SDGs' health-relat ed targets (WHO, 2016b). In the survive domain, for example, targeted reductions in gl obal rates of maternal , newborn, and under-5 mortality are aligned with SDG Goal 3. The thrive domain calls for ending all forms of malnutrition and addressing the nutritional needs of children, adolescent girls, and pregnant and lactating women (which is aligne d with SDG Goal 2); ensuring universal access to sexual and reproductive health care services; substantially reducing pollution-re lated deaths and illnesses; and achieving universal health coverage. In the transform do main, the target of achieving universal and equitable access to safe drinking water, sanitatio n, and hygiene is aligned with SDG Goal 6. Global Financing Facility Achieving the SDG targets will requir e closing the $33.3 billion funding gap for reproductive, maternal, newborn, child, and adol escent health in high- burden LMICs (GFF, 2016). The GFF, the financing arm of Every Women Every Child2, was launched in 2015 and it seeks to address this funding gap in 63 target co untries by supporting country-led efforts to build equitable and resilient health systems and pr omote long-term sustaina ble high-impact, evidence-based interventi ons to each country that have measurable results (Claeson, 2017). To help countries implement these interventions, GFF serves as an innovative financing pathfinder, sh ifting the focus from traditional development assistance towards four strategies: improved efficiency, increased domestic resource mobilization, increasing and be tter aligning external financing, and leveraging private sector reso urces (Claeson, 2017) . Establishing GFF platforms in countries by 2030 has the potential to preven t up to 3.8 million maternal deaths, 101 million child deaths, and 21 million stillbirths (GFF, 2016) . This program has been met with optimism and excitement for the progress it can induce, but b ecause it is so new, it is too difficult to assess yet, though the committee also remains hopeful for its success. Opportunities for Investment and Intervention Although gaps still exist in sp ite of widespread investments by various stakeholders, simple interventions without a large increase in cost can be implemented to address mother and child health issues. A strong evidence base supports the choice of interventions for the prevention of maternal and child deaths, with the current challenge found in the implementation and scaling up of these interven tions. The programs described above largely conti nue to exclude adolescent girls, except when they are pregnant. A more effective strategy would be to focus on the life course, encouraging nutrition and health promotion for infants, children, adolescent girls, and women throughout adulthood, whethe r or not they are pregnant. In the sections below, the 1 The framework spans health-related domains as well as other areas such as promoting education for women, establishing legal identities, and eliminati ng gender-based discrimination and violence. 2 Every Women Every Child is a global movement that puts into action the WHO's Global Strategy for Women's, Children's, and Adolescent's Health. Launched by the UN Secretary-General in 2010, Every Women Every Child aims to mobilize national governments, international organizations, the private sector, and civil society to solve the health issues that women, children, and adolescents face around the world (Every Women Every Child, 2016).

SURVIVE: CONTINUING TO DECREASE MORTALITY RATES To continue the forward progress of the MDGs and address the w eaknesses that prevent the elimination of preventable maternal and child deaths, it is important to understand the remaining barriers in the current burden of di sease in children and women. During the past 15 years, the most important successes in reducing child and maternal mortality have been through immunizations; improved sanitation; and social changes, such as improved access to voluntary family planning methods, that allow women to thrive and take charge of their own decision making (Bustreo and Mpanju-Shumusho, 2016). Mortality Among Children Under 5 Years of Age Immunizations alone are estimated to save 2 to 3 million lives per year (Bustreo and Mpanju-Shumusho, 2016). These advancements have, to a degree, shifted some of the causes of under-5 deaths globally since 1990, so that death ra tes caused by diseases such as measles have dropped by 65.5 percent (Wang et al., 2016). However, many of the causes of under-5 mortality remain the same. Preterm birth, neonatal encep halopathy, and lower re spiratory infections remain in the top five causes of death in chil dren globally, with preterm birth being the leading cause in 2015 3 (Wang et al., 2016). Additionally, environmental hazards such as air pollution, unsafe water, poor sanitation, and second-hand sm oke are now found to be responsible for 26 percent of the nearly 6 million deaths each ye ar of children under 5 years of age (WHO, 2017b). Undernutrition is linked to nearly half of all under-5 deaths (Bl ack et al., 2017). Many of these deaths occur in regions nearly untouched by th e lifesaving interventions and societal changes that have allowed such robust progress in other pa rts of the world. Children in rural areas are still 1.7 times more likely to die before their fifth birthday than child ren in urban areas, and children of mothers with no education are three times more likely to die than chil dren with mothers who have a secondary or higher education (UN, 2015c). Examining preterm birth as one of the top causes of death and di sability in children highlights a need for an improvement in health care services for babi es and their mothers, especially in LMICs, and also explains the important interplay between women's health and children's health. Preventing preter m birth requires both antenata l and postnatal care systems. Preterm birth complications can be prevented and addressed with cost -effective strategies provided by adequately trained midwives; these st rategies can reduce prem aturity by 24 percent (WHO, 2016e). Additionally, the healthy spacing of children play s an important role in the reduction of neonatal and under-5 deaths. Among the urban poor in LMICs, children born within 18 months of an older sibling are two times as likely to die, and children born between 18 and 23 months after an older sibling are 18 percent more likely to die as compared to children born 36 months after an older sibling (Fotso et al., 2013 ). Ensuring that mothers have access to modern 3 The top 20 causes of death for children under-5 are preterm birth, neonatal encephalopathy, lower respiratory infections, diarrheal diseases, congenital anomalies, malaria, neonatal sepsis, other neonatal disorders, meningitis, sexually-transmitted dis eases, whooping cough, road injuries, neonatal hemolytic disease, encephalitis, and intestinal infections.

Maternal Mortality and Morbidity Although unsafe abortion and hemorrhage re main among the most important causes of maternal mortality in low-income countries (Say et al., 2014), the underlying causes of maternal mortality worldwide have become more complex. Almost one-third of global maternal deaths now result from causes not direct ly related to pregnancy, in cluding HIV/AIDS, malaria, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity. In the modern context of this disease burden, midwives and other deliverers of health care serv ices face the additional task of addressing the health needs of pregnant women with chronic illnesses. In add ition to causing greater risks for mothers, noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) or unhealthy lifestyles caus e significant risks for the newborn. Mothers who smoke, for example, ar e likely to breastfeed for shorter periods of time, have less milk, and produce milk that is less nutritious; additiona lly, their second-hand tobacco smoke increases the risk of respiratory infections, sudden infant death syndrome, and asthma in their children (WHO, 2010). The goal of allowing mo re children to survive is contingent on having adequate health care system s for mothers that can provide care and support for routine pregnancies as well as high-risk ones. Although the world has not yet reached the MDG 5-A goal of reducing maternal mortality by 75 percent (achieving fewer than 70 deaths per 100,000 live birt hs), the gains that have been made allowed for women to have grea ter access to trained health care workers during pregnancy. As the world transitions to the SDGs, the improvement in access can provide an entry point for an integration of primary care servic es for reproductive-aged women. Just as many women in the United States ask their obstetricians questions relating to primary care, women in LMICs can likewise benefit from receiving primar y care services during antenatal visits. This integration will be particularly important as th e burden of disease in women shifts to NCDs, because women who are sick are more likely to gi ve birth to babies who are sick: for example, babies born from diabetic mothers are more likel y to develop respiratory problems than babies born from nondiabetic mothers (Lee, 2017). An inte grated health care syst em that lowers the incidence of NCDs in reproductive-aged women will improve women's health overall and will allow women to give birth to healthier babies. In addition to the management of physical health, ensuring the avai lability of mental health services is of utmost importance to en sure the health and safe ty of women and their babies; integrating these services in the prim ary care setting will increase the likelihood that women will take advantage of and benefit from them. It is known that prenatal depression in women is a major risk factor for postnatal depr ession, which has significa nt negative effects on the functioning of the mother and health of her baby. Prenatal and pos tnatal depression in mothers is linked to a higher risk of preterm birth, low birth weight, infant undernutrition, and increased disease incidence in their children (Shidhaye and Giri , 2014). Living in resource-poor areas and receiving poor family support exacerba tes these risks (Shidhaye and Giri, 2014). 4 Maternal depletion syndrome (MDS) is defined as poor maternal health and infant health in LMICs encompassing successive pregnancies, suggesting that short interbirth intervals create poor maternal health and pregnancy outcomes (Winkvist et al., 1992). Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States 5-8 GLOBAL HEALTH AND THE FUTURE ROLE OF THE UNITED STATES PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Offering mental health services to women as they receive antenatal visits will help women avoid incurring extra costs to reach a specialized facility (Honikman et al., 2012). One study in South Africa revealed that among 5,407 women who receive d a mental health screening in a primary care setting during an antenatal vi sit, 32 percent were referred to an on-site counselor, and 62 percent of those who were referred agreed to receive services (Honikm an et al., 2012). In a follow-up, 87.8 percent of women who received counseling services reported an improvement in their presenting problem, and 97.1 percent reported the experience as positive (Honikman et al., 2012). Treatment for maternal depr ession is feasible and provides significant benefits to the entire family. Offering these services at the primary-care level will decrease the barriers to receiving care and can promote healthier pregnancies in women. Targeting Interventions to Maximize Survival Although the scope of challenges across the entire sector of women and children's health is extremely broad, many evidence-based practi ces and interventions can have a high level of impact in a cost-effective manner. The committee ha s selected five key areas (described in the sections below) in which it suggests investment and attention in order to maximize rates of survival for pregnant women and children: im munizations; integrated management of childhood illness; nutrition for pregnant women, newborns, infants, and children; keeping pregnant women safe; and access to contraceptives. Immunizations Immunizations are recognized as a \"best buy\" for global health, estimated to save 2 to 3 million lives each year. In one case\u2014smallpox\u2014vaccination led to disease eradication. Increased coverage of the measles vaccination alone is estimated to have saved 14 million lives since 2000 (Bustreo and Mpanju-Shumusho, 2016). However, infections leading to pneumonia and diarrhea\u2014that could be prevented through immunization\u2014are still some of the top contributors to mortality for children under 5. WHO estimates there are 1.5 million vaccine- preventable child deaths every year, 75 pe rcent of which result from pneumococcus, Haemophilus influenzae serotype b (Hib), and rota virus diarrhea (Gavi, 2015). Global coverage for pneumococcal vaccine ha s reached only 35 percent of children under 5, and even that number is sometimes reduced because of supply issues (Gavi, 2015). Rotavirus coverage numbers are slightly lower with just 23 percent cove rage (WHO, 2016c), also due to supply concerns and ill-equipped immunization systems in some countries. Although global coverage of three doses of Hib vaccine is estimat ed to be 64 percent, there is great variability across regions. In the Americas this number is as high as 90 percent, ye t the Western Pacific only has 25 percent coverage (WHO, 2016c). To reach child mortality targets, it will be critical to scale up coverage for these three vaccines. Si nce its establishment in 2000, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance (Gavi), has employed innovative mechan isms (discussed further in Chapter 8) to increase vaccination coverage and subsidize the costs of new vaccines that lack a commercial market. Additionally, it has established groups focused on pneumococcus, Hib, and rotavirus\u2014the top three most frequent cau ses of pneumonia and diarrhea (Greenwood, 2014). As a result of these groups partnering with c ountry governments, ministries of health and finance, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), there ha s been rapid introduction of the Hib and pneumococcal vaccines (Greenwood, 2014).

Integrated Management of Childhood Illness Historically, treatment of the top causes of death among children (e.g., neonatal causes, diarrhea, pneumonia, AIDS, and ma laria) occurred within vertical programs. In the 1990s, there was a push for integrated management of the sick child. Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) was developed in 1995 by WHO and the United Nations Children's Fund to promote health and provide preven tive and curative services for children under 5 in countries with high child mortality rates (WHO, 2016f). Th e approach focused on 3 key components of improving case management skills of health care staff, overall health systems, and family and community health practices. IMCI was expected to increase the probability that children would receive treatment for all major diseases and decr ease the possibility that children would receive correct treatment for one disease and die from an other unrecognized illness (Victora et al., 2006). In this integrated system, children are screened for risk factors, signs, and symptoms of the key diseases listed previously and treated based on needs. For proper management, children should be assessed for malnutrition, anemia, and vacci nation status. Parents and caregivers of low- weight children receive nutrition counseling. Varying levels of cl assification are assigned based on needs, and children are discha rged as those classifications designate. Evaluations of this approach have shown some reductions in child mo rtality and improved quality of care, but IMCI needs to be complemented by efforts to rede sign and strengthen th e health system, and significant reductions in mortality will not be realized until widesp read intervention coverage is achieved (WHO, 2016f). Additiona lly, childhood mortality reductions were found to be limited when a country's approach lacked an emphasi s on equity, community engagement, and linkages across sectors (e.g., water and sanitation or education). Nutrition for Pregnant Women, Ne wborns, Infants, and Children Children who survive undernutrition have diminished wellness and productivity trajectories, contributing up to a 12 percent reduction in a countr y's GDP (Soe-Lin et al., 2016). Because a child's nutrition starts in utero, ma ternal undernutrition has significant consequences for that child's future growth, h ealth, and development (Black et al., 2013). The threat of stunting as a result of undernutrition is most serious in the 1,000 days from conception until the age of 2; this window is vital because the negative effect s of undernutrition on the brain and on future development cannot be remediated (USAID, 2014) . Consequently, the committee has identified nutritional interventions as posse ssing great potentia l not only for continuing to decrease the mortality rates of infants and young children, but for improving their developmental trajectories. Among many successful programs is USAID's Multi -Sectoral Nutrition Strategy, which targets its nutritional interventio ns to pregnant women and their children during the first 1,000 days (USAID, 2014). Through their interventions at several levels, the committee encourages the continuation of these cross-cutting efforts. Ensuring babies are born at adequate birth weig ht starts with the mother's nutrition, even before she gets pregnant. Making certain that pr egnant women have access to adequate food will ensure that the baby has nutrients to grow and develop in utero (USAID, 2014). The Multi- Sectoral Nutrition Strategy a ddresses women's nutritional needs by increasing women's access to high-quality nutrition services to ensure they gain adequate weight during pregnancy, avoid anemia, and, for women with HIV, safely br eastfeed after the baby is born (USAID, 2014). Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States 5-10 GLOBAL HEALTH AND THE FUTURE ROLE OF THE UNITED STATES PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS One of the most widely supported interventi ons for nutrition after the baby is born is exclusive breastfeeding, in cluding the provision of colostrum in the first few hours and days of a baby's life (Black et al., 2008; WHO, 2017a). In the 2016 Lancet series Breastfeeding, researchers found that the deaths of 823,000 ch ildren and 20,000 mothers each year could be averted through universal breastfeed ing (Victora et al., 2016). Breastfeeding is essential to child survival in part because of its unique biologi cal contribution to the child's immune response (Victora et al., 2016). Similar to the added be nefits of sufficient nutrition for young children, breastfeeding can contribute to long-term positive eff ects such as reduction of the risk of diabetes and obesity later in life, as well as higher c ognitive performance. A study in Brazil that followed participants for 30 years found a positive association with adult earnings\u2014roughly 20 percent of the average income level (Victora et al., 2015). Th e majority of this effect (72 percent) was explained by the direct benefits of breastfeeding on intelligence. The benefits of breastfeeding also extend to the mothers, and include a reductio n in incidence of breast cancer, improvement in birth spacing, and possible reductions in women's risk of diabetes and ovarian cancer (Victora et al., 2016). In addition to breastfeeding, micronutrient s upplementation is a key intervention to improve maternal, infant, and child health. En suring mothers and children receive adequate nutrients will help them stay healthy, which has lasting effect s on development. Iron and folate deficiencies, for example, which are two of the most common causes of anemia during pregnancy, can lead to pregnanc y complications as well as poor development consequences for the baby (Darnton-Hill and Mkparu, 2015). Children need diversity as well as adequate amounts of nutrient-rich foods after the breastfeeding st age (USAID, 2014). Vitamin A, for example, is extremely important for the eyesight of mother s and children, as well as the immune system development of young children (WHO, n.d.-b). However, it is estimated that 250 million preschool children will be vitamin A defici ent, leading to about 250,000 to 500,000 children losing their eyesight every y ear (WHO, n.d.-b). Supplementation with vitamin A keeps children healthy and is known to signifi cantly reduce mortality for chil dren under 5 years (USAID, 2014), and it keeps women healthy in the final trimester, when the demand for vitamin A is highest for the mother and unborn child (WHO, n.d.-b). USAID's Multi-Sectoral Nutrition Strategy seeks to improve intake of micronutrients , including vitamin A, by increasi ng the availability and quality of nutrient-rich foods for women, who in many c ontexts receive less food than other members of the family (USAID, 2014). Nutrition interventions delivered via community health workers can be a key resource for reducing nutrition-relate d maternal, infant, and child mortality. For example, community health workers in rural Uganda decreased nutrition-related morbidity and mortality simply by offering health information to families with children und er 5 years and encouraging families to attend health outreach activ ities (USAID, 2014). Th e community health worker, then, has the opportunity to build trust with mothers during pr egnancy and immediately af ter birth to ensure a mother is empowered to make proper nutritional d ecisions for herself and her child, and can then follow the mother as the child grows and develops. Keeping Pregnant Women Safe: Prenatal Care , Safe Delivery, and Access to Emergency Obstetrical Care Although the number of women who die each year from pregnancy and childbirth complications has fallen by nearly half in the past 20 years, every ye ar 303,000 women still die from these causes (WHO, 2016d). Almost all thes e deaths could be prevented if these women Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States INVESTING IN WOMEN'S AND CHILDREN'S HEALTH 5-11 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS had access to skilled care, good hygiene, and ava ilable drugs to manage conditions (such as preeclampsia) caused by high-risk pregnancie s (Bustreo and Mpanju-Shumusho, 2016). Various interventions during the prenat al period are relatively simp le, such as the provision of supplements like iron and folic aci d; exercising safely during pregnancy; and, more recently, a booster vaccine to protect against pertussis5 to give protection benefits to the unborn child. With so many comorbidities contributing to more complex pregnancies, expanding the scope of training and skills for midwives and skilled bi rth attendants to in clude knowledge about hypertension, healthy nutrition, an d other lifestyle fact ors can enhance the delivery of simple, life-saving interventions to women at ri sk of complex pregnancy and delivery. Worldwide, at least 15 percent of pregnanc ies result in complications that require emergency obstetric care, including surgical management, and an estimated 951 million women are without access to this type of care (Meara et al., 2015). In 2010, the collective disability for all measured maternal disorders reached 16 milli on disability-adjusted life years, of which 3.3 million were attributed to maternal hemorrhage, 1.8 million to complications of obstructed labor, and 1.3 million to maternal sepsis (Murray et al., 2012). These numbers indicate the tremendous morbidity associated with surgically preventabl e obstetric complications that can be targeted worldwide. Two interventions will have a major impact in reducing the toll of maternal death and disability: the presence of a trained attendant at every birth and access to urgent obstetric care at every birth. Increasing the number of women giving birth in a facility or with a skilled attendant has been challenging, but rate s are on the rise. One study in Tanzania showed that using simplified ultrasound scanning at th e lowest levels of care led to mothers' increased attendance for future antenatal care and increased chances of a facility delivery (Mbuyita et al., 2015). This finding was reinforced with the finding that para professionals with minimal training can perform sonographic procedures on rural pregnant women in Tanzania with conseque nt beneficial effects (Bellagio Study Group on Child Surv ival, 2003). A report from the Lancet Commission on Global Surgery determined that all people shou ld have timely access to emergency surgical services, which includes the ability to \"access, within 2 hours, a facility that can do caesarean delivery . . . 2 hours is a threshol d of death from complications of childbirth\" (Meara et al., 2015). Several studies have shown that with the exception of very few countries, devoting appropriate financial resources to cesarean delivery, for exampl e, could combat the catastrophic health consequences to mothers in an economi cally favorable fashion (Meara et al., 2015). A combined set of relatively simple interv entions integrated with appropriate task shifting and work force training within a func tioning health system may have a tremendous effect on the overall well-being of any LMIC. In terventions should be aimed at streamlining care so that women in need of an emergent cesarean delivery are aware of f acilities available, are properly diagnosed, can be transpor ted to a referral hospital with in a reasonable amount of time, and undergo safe cesarean delivery in a capable facility. Access to Contraceptives Access to modern contraceptives is a critical foundation for maternal and child health, according to the Lancet series Maternal Health (Ces chia and Horton, 2016). Preventing unwanted pregnancy, family planning, and delaying of pregnancy through healthy birth spacing are critical actions to reduce both maternal and infant death, as well as provide other health benefits to women (Ahmed et al., 2012). An anal ysis of 172 countries showed that family 5 This vaccine (Tdap) provides protection agains t tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis (CDC, 2016). Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Countries with the highest maternal mo rtality burden also have low contraceptive prevalence rates. In many of these countries, th e unmet need for contra ception is even higher than the prevalence of contraceptive use (A hmed et al., 2012). The London Summit on Family Planning (the FP2020 initiative) in 2012 co mmitted countries to providing access to contraceptives to an additional 120 million women by 2020, requiring 15 million to gain access each year (Ceschia and Horton, 2016). As of October 2016, 8 million additional women are accessing modern contraceptive methods each year. Though they are off track for achieving the goal, the FP2020 initiative has increased contraceptive users by 30.2 million since 2012, putting the total at 300 million in the world's 69 poorest countries, a huge milestone. As a result of this increase in contraceptive use, between July 2015 and July 2016, the FP2020 initiative estimated that globally, 82 million unintended pregnancies were prevented, 25 million unsafe abortions were averted, and 124,000 maternal d eaths were averted (FP2020, 2016). At a more granular level, when contracepti ve prevalence in Kazakhstan increased by 50 percent between 1990 and 2000, abortion rates decrea sed by 50 percent in the same time frame (Westoff, 2000). More recently, a study in Ghan a found that lack of acces s to contraceptives likely caused the observed 12 percent increase in rural pregnancies, leading to 200,000 additional abortions and more than 500,000 additional unwante d births (Jones, 2011). The researchers also found the unwanted children were less likely to ha ve proper nutrition and development (Jones, 2011). Moving forward, the challenge will be examin ing country-level inequities and issues and understanding why some countries have been quick to implement this commitment to contraception access, while others lag behind. The United States has long supported international family pl anning and population issues, and it is the largest donor to glob al family planning and reproductive health efforts. The Senate Appropriations Committee, with bipartisan support, recently approved its vers ion of a fiscal year (FY) 2017 U.S. Department of State foreign op erations appropriations bill that funds the operations of the U.S. government's foreign assi stance program, including international family planning and reproductive health (PAI, 2016). This continued support will be critical to achieve the maternal and child health-related SDG targets. SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATION Despite the tremendous strides made in reducing mortality am ong women and children, nearly 6 million children still die annually before their fifth birt hday, and an estimated 303,000 women die each year from preventable pregnancy- and childbirth-related causes (WHO 2016a,d). Maternal mortality stan ds at 216 per 100,000 births, while child deaths are at 41 per 1,000 live births (Kassebaum et al., 2016; UN, 2015c ). Investing in women and children yields proven short- and long-term benefits for a country's economy. USAID has increased its investments in reducing maternal, newborn, and child deaths and recen tly launched the Ending Preventable Maternal and Child Death initiative, but gaps still exist with respect to subnational inequity in access to care. Many of the causes of death that still plague both women and children are preventable; for example, unde rnutrition is linked to nearly ha lf of all deaths of children under 5 (Black et al., 2017). Extremely strong evidence supports the most effective interventions for preventing maternal and child deaths, yet the remaining challenge is to implement and scale up these interventions in locations that have the highest level of need.

All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States INVESTING IN WOMEN'S AND CHILDREN'S HEALTH 5-13 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Conclusion: Current mortality rates for both mothers and children under age 5 are still unacceptably high. Sustained inves tments in cost-effective, evidence- based interventions are needed to prevent the deaths of infants, children, adolescents, and pregnant and lactating women. Recommendation 7: Improve Survival in Women and Children Congress should increase funding for the U.S. Agency for International Development to augment the agency's investments in ending preventable maternal and child mortality, defined as global maternal mortality rates of fewer than 70 deaths per 100,000 live births by 2020 and fewer than 25 child deaths per 1,000 live births by 2030. Investments should focus on the most effective interventions and be suppo rted by rigorous monitoring and evaluation. These priority interventions include Immunizations; Integrated management of child illness; Nutrition (pregnant women, newborns, infants, children); Prenatal care and safe delivery, incl uding early identification of at- risk pregnancies, safe delivery, and access to emergency obstetrical care; and Access to contraceptives and family planning. THRIVE: MEETING DEV ELOPMENT POTENTIAL AND BUILDING COUNTRY FUTURES In LMICs, 250 million children (43 percent of the population) younger than 5 years do not reach their developmental potential because of extreme poverty and stunting (Black et al., 2017). Saving lives is critical , but simply keeping children from dying around the world is not enough. As child mortality declines, the focus co rrectly shifts to thri ving, or maximizing the cognitive, language, and emotional development of children. In addition to developmental interventions, efforts must also include nurturi ng care, that is, the supportive environment in which a child grows and develops. Nurturing care is a core principle underlying the support for children to thrive (Britto et al., 2017). This concept is realized by having a stable home environment that is sensitive to children's health and nutritiona l needs, responsive, emotionally supportive, and developmentally stimulating and appropriate, with opportunities for play and exploration and protection from adversities (Britto et al., 2017) . Such early child development practices translate into significan t lifelong benefits in terms of labor market participation and earnings (Richter et al ., 2017). Early and continued investment s in children can help them grow and develop into healthy and productive adults, ultimately cont ributing to economic growth. Links Between Adverse Childhood Experiences and Diminished Adult Outcomes Children who live in poverty in LMICs and are exposed to negative stressors such as violence or abuse are subject to many repe rcussions into adulthood (Currie and Vogl, 2013). Research continues to emerge on the strong links between adverse childhood experiences and physical, emotional, and social outcomes in adu lthood. When children are e xposed to violence or Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Child ren with greater exposure to violence may grow up to become perpetrators of violence or revictimized in adulthood (Moylan et al., 2010; Widom et al., 2008). The documente d associations between low socioeconomic status in early childhood and br ain development (Noble et al ., 2015) may explain the well- established associations betw een poverty and low cognitive , academic, and behavioral performance (Hair et al., 2015). These long-term effects of early life experiences make it critically important for service providers and stakeholders to change their thinking to accurately target interventions and services to prevent and mitigate those problems. Scientific evidence supports the notion that th e period from conception to age 3 years is a crucial time for interventions (Bla ck et al., 2017). The ear ly years in a child's life are critical for investments for physical growth and cognitive and socioemotional development. For example, the association of linear growth and cognitive development is str onger for children under 2 than for older children, although the association appear s to persist beyond the firs t 2 years of a child's life (Sudfeld et al., 2015). Gear ing assistance and evidence-b ased interventions for young children toward their physical, cognitive, and social-emotional development offers clear long- term returns on investment. Fostering Positive Environments for Children and Families The social, economic, political, climatic, and cultural context can provide broad support and guidance for the implementation of family-fri endly systems that enable nurturing care to support children best (Britto et al., 2017). Positive and healthy environments for children and families should be prioritized. For example, social protection programs are designed to reduce poverty and provide opportunities to improve ch ild development (Britto et al., 2017). Supportive environments are then likely to extend past the indivi dual and immediate family and often create a ripple effect throughout the co mmunity. Previous attempts to create packages of effective interventions have focused eith er on grouping interventions because they should happen at the same time (e.g., packaging interventions that co-occur during the same age period of the child) or packaging interventions that are delivered through the same syst em (e.g., maternal health). The recent Lancet series Early Child Development proposed a set of packages th at consider these factors while also incorporati ng nurturing care and protection a nd tailoring the packages to unique sets of risks and adversit ies that characterize complex environments (Britto et al., 2017). The packages proposed in the review are family support and strengthening (i.e., in creasing access to quality care, building skills, and providing so cial-sector support); \"caring for the caregiver\" (i.e., caring for and protecting the parent's physical and mental health with a life -cycle approach); and early learning and protection package (i.e., supporting parents, teachers, and caregivers in learning programs) (Britto et al., 2017). Prom oting positive environments for children and families often does not require new services or programs, but instead demands the in tegration of existing programs, structures, and systems of service delivery unde r a more holistic lens. This in tegration should be considered Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Health Care and Social Services Maternal and newborn health programs should be designed and conducted as an integrated whole, rather than separate programs fo r two types of patients, as is currently the case in many places. The Lancet series Maternal Mortality recen tly found that linking health care for a mother and her baby not only promotes greater e fficiency and lowers costs, but also maximizes the effect on their health and su rvival (Lassi et al., 2013). Having a mother visit one clinic for her own maternal care and a nother clinic at a different time, and often in a separate location, for her newborn's care is duplicative and inefficient. Su ch an arrangement creates an added burden and may make women more likely to miss appointme nts. For example, until recently, HIV/AIDS services and maternal and new born health services were not available at the same service delivery points, making it difficult for women a nd their newborns to receive both types of necessary care (SMGL, 2014). Many opportunities for this type of packaging and collaboration can take place without new infrastructure or funding of new programs. However, success will require both teamwork among global health actors and alignment of efforts to achieve specific, country-appropriate goals. With a recent study finding depression as the largest contributor to disability globally for the 20- to 24-year-old age group (Vos et al., 2016), this imperative is clear to ensure all medical appointments are attended a nd that with each intera ction, a trained provider is available to check on the mother's well-being and mental health to ensure her safety and the safety of the baby. Nurturing Care and Parenting Support In addition to providing simple health-relate d services like immunizations and nutrition\u2014 both critical to encouragi ng a healthy life for a child\u2014the health care delivery syst em is also an opportunity to integrate nonhealth services such as nurturing care and parenting support. Support for caregivers' nutrition and mental and physical health provides se condary benefits in children's growth and development and enhances caregiver receptiveness to parenting programs. Rahman and colleagues (2013) found the relationship betw een maternal mood and infant health and development is not unidirectional (Rahman et al., 2013). Interventions engaging mothers on how to improve infant development had positive impacts on maternal mood, and other interventions designed to improve maternal mood had positive e ffects on the infant's development (Rahman et al., 2013). Studies from across the globe, includ ing Jamaica (Gertler et al., 2014; Grantham- McGregor et al., 1997; Walker et al., 2005), Pakistan (Yousafzai et al., 2014), and Turkey (Kagitcibasi et al., 2009), illustrated by the Lancet series Early Childhood Development, have shown that incorporating nurturing care compone nts into interventions significantly improved childhood development and even later adult outco mes (see Box 5-1). Additionally, members of the Lancet Commission on Early Childhood Developm ent found that programs providing parental support for child devel opment within the context of larg er social protection efforts in Latin America have shown substantial benefits for child development (Fernald et al., 2017). BOX 5-1 Case Studies of Nurturing Care Components Across the Globe Jamaica: Weekly visits over a 2-year period were conducted by community health workers who Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States 5-16 GLOBAL HEALTH AND THE FUTURE ROLE OF THE UNITED STATES PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS taught parenting skills and encouraged mothers and children to interact in ways that develop cognitive and socioemotional skills, including weekly 1-hour play sessions at home with community health aides. Nutritional supplementation was provided in the form of 1 kg of formula containing 66 percent of daily recommended calories, protein, and micronutrients. Study participants were resurveyed 20 years later, and it was found that the stimulation group earned 25 percent more than those in the control group. These findings show a simple psychosocial intervention in early childhood for disadvantaged ch ildren can have a substantial effect on labor market outcomes and compensate for developmental delays. Pakistan: Using the Lady Health Worker program, the study investigated the feasibility and effectiveness of integrating interventions dire cted at children under 2 years of age to enhance child development and growth outcomes. All interventions were integrated within existing services through home visits and group meetings. The enhanced nutrition group received nutrition education and multiple-micronutrient powder. The responsive stimulation group encouraged activities between the child and caregiver, observed and coached by the lady health worker. Responsive stimulation had significant benefits on early child cognitive, language, and motor development outcomes. Turkey: The Turkish Early Enrichment Project carried out two interventions with 4- to 6-year-old children from deprived backgrounds. One intervent ion was a training program for mothers that emphasized educational activities with the child at home plus support for the mother, and the other was an educational preschool environment. In a 19-year follow-up, the researchers found that participants who had been exposed to either type of early enrichment exhibited higher school attainment, began their working lives at a later age, and had higher occupational status than those who had not been exposed. SOURCES: Gertler et al., 2014; Kagitcibasi et al., 2009; Yousafzai et al., 2014 Prevention and Mitigation of Violence The 2014 Global Status Report on Violence Prevention includes data from 133 countries on violence prevalence and prevention, includ ing child abuse and neglect (WHO, 2014b). In spite of the (1) global acceptanc e of child rights, (2) recogniti on of the harmful effects of violence exposure and maltreatment on childre n, and (3) endorsement of home visiting and parent education as effective in reducing ri sk factors for child maltreatment (Mikton and Butchart, 2009), there have been few evaluations of programs to protect children from violence and maltreatment in LMICs (Black et al., 2017). Given the lack of knowledge around risks children face in conflict and as re fugees and the effectiv eness of interventions in fragile countries and failed states, program evaluation is an ar ea where more research is needed. The United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) recommends that efforts along six dimensions are needed as part of a global violence prevention stra tegy (UNICEF, 2014): 1. Support caregivers. 2. Help children manage risks. 3. Change attitudes and norms that encourage violence. 4. Provide support services for children. 5. Implement child protection laws. 6. Conduct data collect ion and research. Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States INVESTING IN WOMEN'S AND CHILDREN'S HEALTH 5-17 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS One intervention that can addre ss some of these dimensions is registering births. In 2012, only 49 percent of births were regi stered in the first year of li fe worldwide. This percentage drops even lower for regions such as South Asia (37 percent) and sub-Saharan Africa (38 percent), although country rates within a region can vary greatly (Lawn et al., 2014). A birth certificate provides the child with an identity and nationality that will allow him or her to access fundamental social services, including medical ca re and education, as well as allowing the child to obtain a driver's license or marriage license later in life. Possession of a birth certificate is linked to higher rates of fini shing primary school (Corbacho et al., 2012), countering early marriage before girls are legally eligible, pr otecting children who are trafficked, ensuring children are enrolled in school, and providing acc ess to immunization and health care (UNICEF, n.d.-a,-b). The biggest hindrance to obtaining birth certificates for children is that parents often need to present documentation such as a marriag e license and visit multiple government agencies to obtain the certificate (Mailman School of Public Health, 2016). Ensuri ng that all births are registered is of critical impor tance to countries as they ev aluate national priorities and international aid. Birth certificates allow countries to make policies based on facts as opposed to ideologies (Mikkelsen et al., 2015), and they he lp to better evaluate international aid needs (Mailman School of Public Health, 2016). Becau se the absence of this crucial information negatively affects policy making and development, it is a strategic objective of WHO's Every Newborn Action Plan to End Prev entable Deaths (WHO, 2014a). Poverty Assistance and Cash Transfers Social safety-net programs support vulnerable populations by distri buting cash transfers to low-income households to prevent shocks, pr otect the chronically poor , promote capabilities and opportunities for vulnerable households, and transform systems of power that exclude certain marginalized groups (e.g., women, ch ildren, rural poor, indigenous). The economic rationale for cash transfer programs is that they can be an equitable and efficient way to address market failures and reach the most vulnerable po pulations (Fiszbein et al., 2009). Most LMICs spend 1-2 percent of their GDP on social transf er programs. Conditional cash transfer programs and microcredit usually target the transfer to mothers based on evidence that money controlled by mothers is spent on more child-centered goods and services than money controlled by fathers (Thomas, 1990). Social safety-net programs are hypothesized to improve outcomes via the family investment model (i.e., having more money to spend on inputs or more time to spend with children) and family stress model (i.e., decr eased maternal depre ssion due to increased household resources). A recent review shows mos tly positive effects of cash transfer programs on some child outcomes, including birth weigh t; infant mortality; illness or morbidity; and cognitive, language, and behavior al development. Strong positive effects of cash transfers on promoting participation in prenatal care, giving bi rth in the presence of a skilled birth attendant, and growth monitoring have been reported (De Walque et al., 2017). Early Childhood Education For the post-2015 agenda, the SDGs call fo r all children by 2030 to \"have access to quality early child development, care and prepri mary education so that they are ready for primary education\" (UN, 2015b). Achievement of this goal will require greater coordination of early child development programming within the br oader education infrastr ucture, with attention to equity in both access and qua lity of services. Education and intellectual support of young children can take many forms. Low- cost activities such as storyt elling, singing, and playing with Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States 5-18 GLOBAL HEALTH AND THE FUTURE ROLE OF THE UNITED STATES PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS household objects expose young children to a rich a nd varied social network that promotes early development (Black et al., 2017). High-quality early child development program s and opportunities for early learning, such as day care, child care, and preschool, improve child outcomes during later schooling (Britto et al., 2017). The inclusion of early child developmen t in the first of six Education for All goals recognizes early child development as an essen tial component of the broader education agenda.6 Additionally, education has been f ound to have downstream health effects, especially when one considers female schooling. For example, a meta-analysis conducted by Schaferhoff and colleagues (2015) found that a 1-year increment in female schooling is associated with a 6.5 to 9.9 percent reduction in mortality for children under 5 in LMICs. Furthermore, 39.6 percent and 17.5 percent of child mortality reducti on between 1990-2000 and 2000-2011, respectively, can be attributed to increases in female schooli ng (Schaferhoff et al., 2015). A challenge in most countries is the lack of a robust system for e ducation for children before they enter primary school. In the United States, for example, there is little support for public-sector day care, and private day care is in short supply, high demand, and comes with extrem ely high out-of-pocket costs. Even for countries with early childhood progr ams, the variability of quality is such that it is difficult to measure effects a nd attribution across the board. Despite the measured benefits of investment in early education for children, many reports still indicate that government s and private donors consider it a low priority (UNESCO, 2006, 2011). Another option for providing supportive early learning envir onments is through media. A meta-analysis representing more than 10,000 children from 15 countries7 found significant benefits in literacy and numer acy, health and safety, and social reasoning and attitudes toward others\u2014all from watching Sesame Street (Mares et al., 2015 ). Although shows like Sesame Street are a relatively easy way to bring learning opportunities to children who cannot join formal learning environments before age 5, gaps rema in that need to be a ddressed for children to be mentally and socially prepared to enter school. SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATION In LMICs, 250 million children younger than age 5 (43 percent) fail to reach their developmental potential because of extreme poverty and stunting (Black et al., 2017). With the decline of nutrition- and infection-related child mortality and the push for universal primary school, the support and promotion of child devel opment is crucially important. The SDGs call for all children to \"have access to quality ea rly child development, care, and preprimary education so that they are r eady for primary education\" by 2 030 (UN, 2015b). Recent evidence indicates that there are significant long-term effe cts of early investments in child cognitive and language development, which translate into lifelong benefits in terms of labor market participation, lifetime earnings, productivity, health, and economic growth (Gertler et al., 2014; Kagitcibasi et al., 2009; Yousafzai et al., 2014). Thus, a \"thrive\" agenda in addition to the existing \"survival\" agenda can be an important focal point for investment. 6 Education for All is a global movement led by UNES CO (United Nation Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) that aims to meet the learning needs of all children, youth, and adults by 2015. 7 Countries analyzed included Australia, Bangladesh, Canada, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Israel, Kosovo, Mexico, Nigeria, Northern Ireland, Palestine, South Afri ca, Tanzania, and Turkey (Mares and Pan, 2013).

All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States INVESTING IN WOMEN'S AND CHILDREN'S HEALTH 5-19 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Conclusion: There is a need for gr eater investment in building enabling, nurturing, and cognitively enriching envir onments (which include responsive and emotionally supportive parenting, oppor tunities for play and learning, and support for early education) for vulnerable children under age 5 and their mothers. These programs can fit within the health, education, or social services sector. Recommendation 8: Ensure Healthy and Pr oductive Lives for Women and Children The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PE PFAR), their implementing partners, and other funders should support and incorporate proven, cost-effective interventions into their existing program s for ensuring that all children reach their developmental potential and beco me healthy, productive adults. This integration should embrace principles of country ownership, domestic financing, and community engagement. These interventions should include the following: Provide adequate nutrition for op timal infant and child cognitive development. Reduce childhood exposure to domestic and other violence. Detect and manage postpartum dep ression and other maternal mental health issues. Support and promote early educatio n and cognitive stimulation in young children. TRANSFORM: DEVELOPING WHOLE SYSTEMS OF CARE Many of the strategies and opportunities for investments rela ted to reducing maternal and child mortality described above do not necessarily require new and separate funding streams or a novel and dedicated workforce. Instead, a change of thinking is required that starts with an examination of all parts of the existing services delivery and support system to see what can be amended to maximize efficiency and effectiven ess. The many opportunities for transformation are most easily and effectively pursued through br oadening the delivery syst em to include social determinants (e.g., poverty and education), e xpanding the workforce skillsets, and bundling different types of services to optimize the inte raction between patient and provider and improve adherence to treatments or behaviors. Altering the Approach for Increased Survival Shifting from a condition-based care and support model for a particular disease to a whole-person approach allows health care and social service workers to address risk and protective factors across the life span. For ex ample, USAID's AIDS, Population, and Health Integrated Assistance Plus program, which inte grates family planning into PEPFAR-platform HIV/AIDS services for women in Kenya (Fle ischman and Peck, 2015), has been commended as a game changer. Such a program could be used as a model for other approaches to integrate essential maternal and child services, such as breast and cervical cancer screening. Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States 5-20 GLOBAL HEALTH AND THE FUTURE ROLE OF THE UNITED STATES PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Program administration that permits fundi ng flexibility and c onnectivity of U.S.- supported efforts will go a long way to ensure th at integrative models are successful. However, the successful scaling, adoption, and sustainability of integrative models requires investments in workforce development. Training community health workers to share the tasks of physicians and nurses serves as an effective means to increase awareness in low-resource settings about NCDs (e.g., high blood pressure), and they can help to disseminate information about particular diseases with the community's needs and cultur e in mind (Abrahams-Gessel et al., 2015). Skilled birth attendants and midwives can also be effectiv ely used to increase their patients' awareness of breast or cervical cancer screening programs. Expanding the Effort to Strengthen Health Systems In many countries, early child development se rvices are delivered through a disconnected set of organizations, primarily NGOs, often with few regulatory guidelines and little coordination with other services or sectors (Black et al., 2017). As th e emphasis on early childhood has increased over the past decade and governments look to increase access to early child development programs, finding effective ways to leverage the nongovernmental sector to increase access and ensure quality is critically important (Black et al., 2017). Platforms for early child development services include home visits , clinical contacts, a nd community-based group sessions as well as newer approaches, such as media (Black et al., 2017). Overall, successful programs are not universal and need more rese arch and contextual understanding. The factors that influence health and development often go well beyond the health se ctor and include the nutrition, education, and social sect ors (Britto et al., 2017). Thus, to truly improve the health and well-being of populations, which is a desired outc ome inherent in the design of the SDGs, policy and practice professionals need to go beyond the health sector to make the needed changes and integrate services across sectors. Integrated approaches should ideally include all sectors and share messages and opportunities for synergy. Several key improvements within the sector of women's and children's health would be rela tively easy to implement and would result in multiple dividends, especially as such interven tions often act synergistically with women and children. Consider the examples from Rahman and colleagues (2013) noted above: multiple studies show strong effects of improved matern al mood and infant health and development simply by having supervised, nonspecialist co mmunity health workers conduct culturally competent interventions (Rahman et al., 2013). Simple improvements to the health systems in countries could also include wo rkforce development changes, me ntal health support for women and families, increased focus on nutrition to address remaining survival issues as well as enhanced thriving, and finally, incr eased cross-sector partnerships at the ground level to provide integrated services. Within the category of workforce development, it is important to ensu re that skilled birth attendants, community health workers, nurses, and primary care physicians have appropriate training in exclusive breastf eeding promotion and can ensure proper nutrition for newborns (WHO, 2017a). Refocusing the health system to include an emphasis on nutrition from pregnancy across the life cycle can ameliorate under-5 mortality and stunting and promote healthy growth as children grow into adolescents and adults. For women, this focus could translate to improved nutrition during pregnancy, ideally propagating the cycle of health and wellness (USAID, 2014).

As a greater proportion of children survive into adulthood, and changes in diet and lifestyle occur, many countries now face a rise in chronic illnesses, such as cardiovascular disease (CVD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) , cancer, and diabetes, all of wh ich are often associated with behavioral factors such as tobacc o use, physical inactivity, and diets high in calories, sugar, and salt (WHO, 2017b). Globally, these chronic or nonco mmunicable diseases (NCDs) kill 40 million people per year, almost three-quarters of whom reside in LMIC s (WHO, 2017b). Though media attention often portrays NCDs as a western, high-income country health challenge, the burden of NCDs disproportionately affects the poor in middle-in come countries-a trend th at will continue to grow alongside rising urbani zation and globalization. In a global trade environment, U.S. interests ar e affected by the rise of NCDs in LMICs and their resultant human and economic effects. Count ries with a high NCD burden tend to have lower national productivity and higher health and welfare expenditur es (Bloom et al., 2011). The costs resulting from productivity losses associated with disability, unplanned ab sences from work, and increased rates of accidents are as much as 4 time s the cost of treatment. Research also has shown that investors, including U.S. businesses, are less likely to ente r markets where the labor force suffers a heavy disease burden. The committee has chosen to focus this chapter on cardiovascular disease and cancer (specifically vaccine-preventable cancers, such as cervical cancer and liver cancer), not only because of their global burden but also because of the amount of research and knowledge that exists and the opportunity for interventi on worldwide. This chapter begins by characterizing the economic and epidemiological burden of NCDs, and demonstrat es how they are both projected to rise in the next 20 years if no action is taken to curb rising incidence. It then explores motivations for U.S. involvement, and highlights existing cost-effectiv e, successful interventions found globally for prevention and early treatment of CVD and select cancers. Finally, this chapter emphasizes a need to transform health systems to be more capable of managing these chronic conditions, particularly highlighting the potential of public-private partnerships. THE RISING ECONOMIC BURDEN OF NONCOMMUNICABLE DISEASES A study conducted by the World Economic Forum a nd the Harvard School of Public Health estimated that the projected increase in the gl obal economic burden of five NCDs (CVD, chronic respiratory disease, cancer, diabetes, and mental h ealth) would result in cumulative output losses of $47 trillion by 2030, which is roughl y 75 percent of the 2010 global gross domestic product (GDP) Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States 6-2 GLOBAL HEALTH AND THE FUTURE ROLE OF THE UNITED STATES PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS (Bloom et al., 2011).1 CVDs were a primary contributor to lo st output (33 percen t), with 18 percent attributed to cancers (Blo om et al., 2011). As of 2015, the esti mated annual global cost of CVD is expected to increase by 16 percent from $906 b illion to more than $1 trillion by 2030 (see Figure 6- 1). Furthermore, total ou tput losses are projected to increase sharply over time (see Figure 6-2). FIGURE 6-1 Global costs of cardi ovascular disease. SOURCE: Reddy et al., 2016. 1 These estimates were generated using EPIC, a tool deve loped by the World Health Organization to simulate the economic impact of diseases on aggregate economic output. EPIC links the value of economic output to quantities of labor and capital inputs, as well as to technology. The EP IC model adjusts labor and capital inputs according to population health. Namely, labor is diminished by disability and death caused by NCDs. Capital is also reduced because costs of screening, treatment, and care claim resources that would otherwise be available for public and private investment. The EPIC model predicts losses caused by different health conditions in terms of their effect on the value of economic output (WEF and WHO, 2011). Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

SOURCES: Bloom et al., 2011, World Economic Forum. Researchers from the Netherlands conducted a se ries of systematic re views to examine the global impact of NCDs at the macroeconomic leve l, including productivity, health care spending, and national income (Muka et al., 2015). CVD account s for the highest health care expenditure in most countries, ranging from 12 to 16.5 percent of the overall health ca re budget (other NCDs ranged between 0.7 and 7.4 percent) (Muka et al., 2015). Additional analyses found a large economic impact of NCDs on pr oductivity across the WHO regions, albeit with large regional differences in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs)2 (Chaker et al., 2015). Similarly, annual cancer costs worldwide were estimated at approximately $1.16 trillion3 in 2010, the equivalent of more than 2 percent of the global GDP (Stewart and Wild, 2014), with projections reaching $8.3 trillion in annual costs by 2030 (Bloom et al., 2011). Yet, investing in cancer care and control could result in millions of avoidable deaths, achieving between $100 and 200 billion in global economic savings (Stewart and Wild, 2014). These costs are astronomical for many countries, even those with high-income status, and demonstrate the imperative behind addressing these two major health burdens. 2 The burden of disability associated with a disease or diso rder can be measured in units called disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). DALYs represent the total number of years lost to illness, disability, or premature death within a given population. See more at https://www. nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/global/i ndex.shtml (accessed April 1, 2017). 3 This figure is the sum of the costs of prevention and treatment, plus the annual economic value of DALYs lost as a result of cancer. It does not include th e longer-term costs to families or the value that patients and families place on human suffering. Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

THE RISING EPIDEMIOLOGICAL BURD EN OF NONCOMMUNICABLE DISEASES Of the 40 million deaths per year caused by NCDs, 17 million are considered to be \"premature\" (below the age of 70), and 87 percen t of these occur in LMICs (WHO, 2017b). Tables 6-1 and 6-2 depict the heterogeneity of conditions th at contributes to morbidity and mortality in 14 LMIC regions, and demonstrate the increasing burd en of NCDs relative to communicable diseases in many parts of the world. Importantly, the health burden resulting from communicable and noncommunicable diseases is not always distinct. Recent studies have linked infections with the onset of chronic non-communicable diseases la ter in life. Following the 2009 H1N1 outbreak, multiple studies found an association between type 1 diabetes onset later in life and those who were diagnosed with H1N1 (Nenna et al., 2011; Piccin i et al., 2012).

Though many incorrectly think that CVD and relevant risk factors are uniqu e to high income countries, the in crease in global mortality is actually attributed to an increasing incidence of CVD in LMICs. In fact, 80 percent of all CVD related deaths occur in LMICs (Lozano et al., 2012; Pena and Bloomfield, 2015) . CVD is now recognized as the leading cause of death globa lly, and in 2015 was responsible for nearly 18 million global deaths. The global burden of CVD is expected to continue to rise; premature deaths will increase from 5.9 million to 7.8 milli on between 2013 and 2025 if current risk factors for CVDs do not change (O'Rourke, 2017). Cancer Cancer is the second largest cause of death worldwide, responsible for 8.8 million deaths (15.7 percent) globally in 2015 (Wang et al., 2016). The majority of the 14 million people diagnosed with cancer each year live in LMICs, wh ere more deaths are caused by cancer than by human immunodeficiency virus/ acquired immunodeficiency syndr ome (HIV/AIDS), (Ferlay et al ., 2013; WHO, 2014). Around two-thirds of the 8.8 million global cancer deaths each year occur in LMICs because of late detection and poor access to treatment (WHO, 2017c), and this number is expected to triple by 2030 (Nyambura, 2017). Experts estimate that between 30 and 50 percent of cancers can currently be prevented, through evidence-based prevention strategies and reducin g risk factors, meaning that up to 3.7 million lives can be saved each year, 80 percent of whom reside in LMICs (Stewart and Wild, 2014). Early detection and management can also cont ribute to the reduction of the cancer burden (WHO, 2017a). Nearly 70,000 women are diagnosed annually with cervical cancer in Africa alone, contributing to 22 percent of all cancers in women (Nyam bura, 2017). As discussed later in this chapter, this and other types of cancer have been shown to be vaccine preventable; thus, there is a potential to substantially reduce can cer deaths by increasing vaccine coverage. In addition to mortality, cancer can also affect an individual's ability to work, which extends negative effects to the broader pr oductivity of a country. For cervi cal cancer in particular, the percentage of attributable absolute DALYs vari ed across countries, for example from 1.6 percent in New Zealand to 13.4 percent in Brazil (Chaker et al, 2015). Barriers to Adequate Care Whereas the populations of high-income c ountries benefit from quality health care centers, well trained health care providers, and regulations on harmful substances, such as tobacco, those in LMICs often lack adequate heal th care infrastructure (W irtz et al., 2011) and policy safeguards. Compounding the challenge, hea lth systems in LMICs are typically designed to handle infectious disease, not to provide the continuity of care needed for NCDs. The Lancet report on Prevention and Management of Chronic Disease explains: Chronic illness demands a complex health -systems response that needs to be sustained across a continuum of care. Ev idence-based interventions should be delivered by health professionals with diverse skills.... Such interventions are Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

(Samb et al., 2010, pp. 1785- 1786). In addition to ill-fitted health systems, tr aditional health care systems in LMICs often lack the fiscal infrastructure to meet patients' long-term health needs. In many LMICs, out-of- pocket expenses account for approximately 50 per cent of total health expenditures, which may only be lowered by increased central government investment in health (Zhang and Liu, 2014). However, increased decentralizati on of health care spending sugge sts that local governments in low-income countries will lack the capital to provide for their citi zens' health care needs, making this government investment more difficult. Fo r many patients, high out- of-pocket expenditures lead them to opt out of seeking medical care and leave the hospital be fore it is recommended by their physicians (Babiarz et al ., 2012). Increasing the number of patients who seek treatment and maintain their therapy regimen continues to be a challenge and hinder the e fforts of global health actors and national governments in achievi ng CVD and cancer prevention targets. Many countries experience difficulties effec ting change in national policy and spending in part because NCDs like CVD are not prioritiz ed in political agendas despite their significant health and economic burden. In addition, the slow ep idemic of NCDs does not create the type of panic or rapid response that inf ectious diseases like Ebola, mu lti-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), or HIV/AIDS can generate (Re ddy et al., 2016). The World Innovation Summit for Health 2016 Behavioral Insights report explains that it can be difficult for policy makers, politicians, and healthcare profe ssionals to emphasize preventative care because of a tendency to \"focus on the immediate problem in front of us, ra ther than the potential future problems that seem distant and abstract\" (Hallsworth et al., 2016). Finding: Although the mortality and morbid ity burdens of CVD and cancers are high, there is evidence that investing in comprehensive health systems and prevention strategies can save millions of lives. Political challenges remain in mobilizing resources and support for NCDs that may not be seen as immediate priorities. MOTIVATION FOR U.S. INVOLVEMENT The growing global burden of mortality due to CVD and cancer poses a significant strategic problem that the United States ca nnot ignore. A 2014 Council on Foreign Relations Task Force report confirms this st ance, stating that U.S. interests will be affected by the rise of NCDs in LMICs because of their human and economic impacts (Daniels et al., 2014). The majority of U.S. spending on global health is directed towards HIV/AIDS, TB, malaria, and other infectious diseases, in a ddition to maternal and child hea lth, nutrition, and family planning. While some funding is directed towards strengthening health systems, there are no dedicated funding streams specifically for NCDs and no presid ential initiatives esta blished to reduce their burden. Even global dialogue about strengthening h ealth systems neglects most chronic diseases (Samb et al., 2010). The 2014 Council on Foreign Rela tions Task Force report outlines steps the United States can take now to address the crit ical issues of NCDs, including promotion of cardiovascular health, and vaccination and screeni ng programs to prevent cancer (Daniels et al., Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States 6-8 GLOBAL HEALTH AND THE FUTURE ROLE OF THE UNITED STATES PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 2014). Many of these services can often be integrated into existing U.S. global health program s and platforms, motivated by three key benefits that are discussed further in the sections below: 1.Universal purpose 2.Economic prosperity and trade benefits 3.Safeguarding U.S. global health investments Universal Purpose Because NCDs are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in high, middle, and low income countries, there is a tremendous opportu nity for a shared innovation approach to developing solutions to comm on problems. By investing in CVD and cancer prevention programs abroad, the United States can identify cost -effective strategies to target these diseases domestically. The potential of this approach has already been de monstrated through a program in King County, Washington, that implemented a m obile health solution for NCD management based on interventions used in Bangladesh, China, and India (Global to Local, n.d.). Additionally, research conducted in other countries, such as that done on Cuba's CIMAvax vaccine, may help to accelerate the discovery of cures and more effective treatments for cancers (Keck, 2016). For rare diseases in particular, expanding re search efforts outside the United States could generate more opportunities for testing and information sharing. Economic Prosperity and Trade Benefits In today's global travel and trade environm ent, when other countries have a healthy population and workforce, the United States be nefits. According to the 2013 report by the Lancet Commission on Investing in Healt h, approximately 11 percent of economic growth in LMICs is attributable to reductions in mortality (Jamis on et al., 2013). Healthy popu lations lead to more stable economies, and this increased stability can encourage business expansion and additional consumption of U.S. goods. When multinational bus inesses open in a new country, it is in their interest to ensure their work force is healthy and productive. Safeguarding U.S. Global Health Investments Many patients suffering from chronic conditions have already been the recipient of U.S. global health aid for communicable diseases such as tuberculosis, malaria, and HIV/AIDS. If those patients are unable to work or die prematurely because of CVD or cancer, then the return on investment is lost. This holds especially true in the case of the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) investments. In 2015, the PEPFAR program provi ded antiretroviral therapy for 9.5 million people (PEPFAR, 2017); it is critical to ensure these significant investments are not lost to morbidity and mortalit y attributable to NCDs. If these patients die prematurely from chronic illness, much of th e progress gained from healthier societies and restabilized economies in PEPFAR part ner countries could be at risk. COST-EFFECTIVE AND HIGH-IMPACT GLOBAL INTERVENTIONS A 2011 World Economic Forum report identif ied a set of high ly cost-effective population- and individual-based \"best buy\" interventions be implemented in resource-constrained LMIC hea lth systems (WEF, 2011) (see Table 6-3).

Scaling up only the best buy interventions for CVD during that same time period, at a cumulative cost of $120 billi on, would drive a 10 per cent decrease in CVD- attributable mortality and a $377 billion projected cumulative economic benefit (WEF, 2011).

The analysis demonstrated an av erage benefit-cost ra tio of 8:1, with annual benefits of $63.3 billion at a global cost of only $8.5 billion per year (see Table 6-4).

In exam ining these \"best buy\" interventions at a more granular level, the suggested practices can either be classified as policies targeted at the popul ation level, or at the point of service delivery. A growing body of research demons trates that interventions, such as fiscal and regulatory policies, that target be havioral and environmental risk f actors that contribute to NCDs have a positive impact on health outcomes and can be cost effective (Cec chini et al., 2010; WEF, 2011). Of note, 7 of the top 10 risk factors contri buting to global DALYs affect cardiovascular health (Forouzanfar et al., 2016).4 Given that risk behaviors asso ciated with the onset of CVD later in life often form during childhood and adolescence, a life c ourse approach is critical to the prevention of NCDs (Lobstein et al., 2015). It is therefore important to target interventions in a comprehensive manner and develop approaches and interventions that cha nge the nature of the consumer environment across the life course (e.g., changing availability, price, marketing practices that influence food choices a nd preferences) (Hawke s et al., 2015). In addition to targeting risk factors through policy and regulatory means, communities and institutions can reduce CVD and cancer risk and thereby improve the health and well-being of their population by targeting se rvice delivery. A crit ical component of th is approach includes vaccination campaigns and screening programs, whic h can prevent the diseas e or catch it in its early stages before it devolves into a life-thre atening illness or adverse event. The reach of policies and programs can be expanded by ta rgeting points where th e population already interfaces with the health care delivery system. Ex amples include integrating additional services into health care visits and conducting scr eening programs in high-traffic locations. Across these various types of policy or health services interventions, the committee chose to prioritize prevention and early diagnosis. The committee urges U.S. global health programs to hone in on prevention and screening efforts to reduce disease incidence, contain disease progression in early stages, and decrease the economic burden in countries with high rates of CVD and cancer. Solutions for prevention of thes e diseases may also have a parallel impact on many other health outcomes as well, as many NCDs share risk factors. Moreover, solutions developed in other countries have the potential for application in the United States, as Americans also suffer from high burdens of CVD and cancer. Fiscal and Regulatory Policies to Reduce Risk Factors for NCDs Changes in individual behavior are difficult to achieve and maintain and the effects of behavior changes manifest ove r a long period of time. Fiscal and regulatory population-based approaches, which have been successful in re ducing NCD risk factors such as smoking and 4 These include blood pressure, smoking, fasting plasma glucose, body mass index, total cholesterol, alcohol use, and sodium intake.

All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States PROMOTING CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH AND PREVENTING CANCER 6-11 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS alcohol consumption, are among the most effective means to curb the burden of CVD and cancer. Examples of such policies are discussed in the sections below. Fiscal Policies Fiscal approaches, often considered as part of a philosophy of \"nudging,\" are an attempt to change behaviors through taxation or subsidization (Hector, 2012). In a study comparing interventions to address obesity (e.g., food labeling, fiscal meas ures, worksite interventions, mass media) in Brazil, China, India, Mexico, Ru ssia, and South Africa, fiscal measures were consistently found to be cost sa ving and generated the largest or second largest health effects in 20- and 50-year projections, in comparison to th e other interventions (Cecchini et al., 2010). Another recent review and meta -analysis showed that a 10 per cent price reduction or subsidy increases consumption of healthful foods and be verages by 14 percent, whereas the same price increase or tax reduces consump tion of unhealthy foods or bevera ges by 7 percent (Afshin et al., 2015). For example, a sugar tax employed in Mexic o, where a one peso per liter tax was levied on sugar-sweetened beverages, resulted in an overall 7.6 percent reduction in sugar-sweetened beverage purchases 2 years afte r the tax was levied (Colchero et al., 2017). The decrease in purchase rate was even greater among low-soci oeconomic status households (11.6 percent) (Colchero et al., 2017), demonstra ting how these fiscal and regulat ory policies often most benefit a country's poorest. The health effects of th is tax from 2013 to 2022 are likely to include substantially lower incidence of type 2 diabetes cases, strokes, and myocardial infarctions, and fewer deaths. As a result, the tax is projected to save Mexico $983 m illion (S\u00e1nchez-Romero et al., 2016). Fiscal approaches have also been proven as an effective means to curb tobacco use. Over 100 studies, including those done in LMICs, have shown that taxation has a major effect on rates of smoking (Summers and Jamison, 2013). Th e Lancet Commission on Investing in Health found that adding a 50 percent pri ce increase in cigarettes through tax in China would avert 20 million deaths and generate an extra $20 billion in revenue over the next 50 years (Summers and Jamison, 2013). Additionally, a study in China that analyzed the impact of a tax of 50 percent on tobacco products revealed that the tax would most benefit the poor: of the 231 million years of life gained as a result of the tax over 50 years, one-thir d of those are expected to be gained by the lowest socioeconomic quintile, and of the $24 billion of decreased expenditures on tobacco-related disease, 28 percent would benefit the lowest quintile (Verguet et al., 2015). Regulatory Policies In addition to fiscal measures, policy makers have used regulatory means to influence behavioral and environmental factors contributing to NCD burden. For tobacco use, for example, a widely used approach is the requirement of wa rning labels, which has proven be to effective in raising awareness of the dangers of tobacco and reducing consum ption (Mallikarjun et al., 2014). For example, a study set in Indi a revealed that for those who noticed the labels on tobacco products, 71.5 percent reported th at the labels made them think about quitting smoking, and those individuals had much greater knowledge about the relationship between tobacco use and lung cancer (Mallikarjun et al., 2014). Given that t obacco-related illnesses ar e projected to kill 8 million people per year by 2030 (ASH, 2015), a dua l pronged prevention strategy using taxation and regulation can assist in decreas ing the burden of cigarette smoking. Another key risk factor for many NCDs, often related to cigarette sm oking, is air quality. In fact, approximately 2 billion children live in areas where pollution levels exceed the minimum Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States 6-12 GLOBAL HEALTH AND THE FUTURE ROLE OF THE UNITED STATES PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS air quality standards se t by the W orld Health Organization (WHO) (UNICEF, 2016). Every year, nearly 600,000 children under the ag e of 5 die from diseases either caused or exacerbated by indoor or outdoor air pollution. With the growing trends of globalizati on and urbanization, many experts expect this number to climb unless c onditions are improved. Improving air quality through reductions in pollution will not only help the children exposed, but will also realize benefits for the whole soci ety\u2014through increased producti vity and more sustainable development (UNICEF, 2016). Given that deaths from air pollution co st the global economy $225 billion in lost labor income and more than $5 trillion in welfare losses in 2013 (World Bank and IHME, 2016), a concerted effort towards impr oving air quality is needed. Opportunities for regulation exist to address ai r pollution from several angles , including limiting the open burning of waste or developing regulations for the dete ction of environmental diseases. For example, Israel's Clean Air Law of 2008 set limits fo r emissions upon major industrial polluters, in addition to spot checks and pena lties for violation, and the Pollution Control Department in Thailand adopted new vehicle emissions standa rds and low sulphur fu el, decreasing Bangkok's air pollution (UNEP, 2014). When done in coopera tion with the private sector, air quality can be improved in a sustainable and cost-effective ma nner\u2014leading to reduced mortality rates and economic burden. Screening Programs for Early Detection a nd Treatment of Cardiovascular Disease Blood pressure screening is a re latively inexpensive and simple health service that could easily be integrated with the existing health services offered through established U.S. global health programs. By offering blood pressure scr eening at the same location and using the same staff (after a period of training, as discussed below), U.S. global health programs could cost- effectively initiate CVD care in pa rtner countries. Early screening al erts individuals that they are at risk for developing CVD, which can prompt behavior change and regular health care visits for improved management of the condition. Given the burden of CVD in LMICs, where 80 percent of deaths from CVD occur (Lozano et al., 2012 ; Pena and Bloomfield, 2015), and the knowledge that hypertension is a major risk factor for CVD screening will be a vita l tool for reducing the burden of NCDs. However, due to the additional social, politi cal, and economic concerns in LMICs, it is important to contextualize the screening programs being implemented, as they will be contingent on the care services available, the supply chain of treatment regimens, the abilities of the medical providers in different locations, a nd the physical infrastructure of the health facilities. Vedanthan et al. (2015) examined CVD progr ams in western Kenya, noting that screening programs are just the first step of many required to ensure successful CVD preven tion, and argued that the entire care cascade must be used effectively in order fo r the programs to be suc cessful (see Box 6-1).

SOURCE: Vedanthan et al., 2015. Immunization Strategies for Vaccine-Preventable Cancers In recent years, cancer prevention has moved beyond screenings and early detection into the realm of primary prevention\u2014o r the prevention of disease before it even occurs. The two most common cancers in Africa\u2014cervical can cer and liver cancer\u2014have been linked to infections with human papillomavirus (HPV) a nd hepatitis B, respectiv ely. Consequently, the risk of developing these cancer s can be substantially reduced through vaccination. Of the 2 million people infected with hepatitis B worldwid e (with 250 million more as chronic carriers), 600,000 die each year as a result of liver cancer or liver failure due to viral infection (Gavi, 2012). Similarly, HPV is estimated to cause 275,000 deaths annually through progression to cervical cancer, the majority of which occur in LMICs. Without cha nges in prevention and control measures, this number is projected to rise to more than 400,000 deaths by 2035 (Gavi, 2015). Vaccines against HPV and hepatitis B have the potential to prevent many of these deaths caused by cervical and liver cancers. Mother-to-child transmission is the most co mmon route of hepatitis B infection (Franco et al., 2012), although sexual contact is also an important mode . WHO's Sector Strategy to Prevent Viral Hepatitis calls attention to a timely hepatitis B virus birth-dose vaccination as a key method to prevent mother-to-child transmissi on, an approach that could be enhanced through antenatal testing and the use of antiviral drugs (WHO, 2016b). The WHO strategy sets targets for 50 percent coverage by 2020 and 90 percent cove rage by 2030 (WHO, 2016b). By the end of 2014, all low-income countries had introduced the hepatitis B vaccine in to routine immunization programs, and global childhood hepatitis B virus vaccination coverage had increased to more than 82 percent (WHO, 2016b). However, coverage of hepatitis B virus bi rth-dose lagged behind at just 38 percent (WHO, 2016b). Improving this birth-dose covera ge could reduce the number of deaths related to hepatitis B. Since 2006, HPV vaccination has contributed to a decrease in HPV incidence in young women in the United States by two-thirds (Hoffm an, 2016), and a decline in cervical cancer rates are expected as vaccinated women age. With th e help of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance (Gavi), one million girls have been immunized against HPV in 19 countries since 2013 (Gavi, n.d.). This has been achieved through lowering the vaccine price, using schools and community centers to reach school-aged girls, integrating the vaccine with other routine vacci nations and adolescent health programs, and improving communication at the co mmunity level to raise awareness about HPV (Gavi, n.d.). However, a strategy beyond reliance on Gavi will be necessary, as many countries with a high HPV burden may not be Gavi eligible or may have recently graduated from its assistance, as is the case in southeast Asia (a mfAR, 2016). In order to reach the largest number of girls and women at risk fo r developing cervical cancer, more comprehensive operations are Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States 6-14 GLOBAL HEALTH AND THE FUTURE ROLE OF THE UNITED STATES PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS needed. This may prove challenging, as barriers to increased vaccination rates in LMIC include m istrust of government healthcare programs and a ssociation of the vaccine with sexual activity (Agosti and Goldie, 2007), which plagues v accine implementation in many high-income countries as well. Regardless, a concerted effort to increase HPV vaccination rates, thereby reducing the risk for cervical cancer, is a wort hy endeavor, as cervical cancer now ranks as the 4th leading type of cancer for women across the world (WHO, 2016a). In response to this need, global support for HPV vaccination programs has grown in recent years. By building on the valuable efforts of Gavi and working to fill the gaps in HPV vaccine coverage, the United States can capitalize on this momentum and significantl y contribute to the progress being made to reduce the burden of cervical cancer. Although routine vaccines for cervical and live r cancers are effective low-cost preventive tools, early-stage detection is also critical for effective, le ss costly treatment for those not covered by preventive interventions or who have di sease etiology that is not vaccine preventable. For example, a 4-year pilot project on early diagnosis achieved a 34 percent decrease in presentation of late-stage cervical cancer by enabling women to receive early stage treatment (Devi et al., 2007). Additional success has been shown in detection a nd treatment of early cervical cancer in Zambia, where simple interv entions can be conducted without the need for costly infrastructure or highly trained specialists (see Box 6-2). Finding: Evidence-based strategies and interventions exist to address CVD and cancers both at the population level (such as fiscal and regulatory policies) and at the health care delivery level (suc h as early screening and immunization campaigns). TRANSFORMING HEALTH SYSTEMS FOR NONCOMMUNICABLE DISEASES Instead of creating a new \"vertical\" or singular disease program for C VD or cancers, U.S. global health programs can leverage existing stak eholders and programs to address risk factors and care delivery more holistically. A great exampl e of this is the newly launched Global Hearts initiative, a collaboration among WHO, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the World Heart Federation, the World Str oke Organization, the Inte rnational Society of Hypertension, and the World Hypertension League (WHO, 2016c). The in itiative will provide governments with technical support needed to implement and scale up interventions\u2014such as those highlighted in this chapte r\u2014to reduce blood pressure and prevent heart attacks and strokes. Beyond leveraging existing programs, changing the appr oach of health system design to be more integrated and holistic in nature, and decentra lizing services at the community level can be beneficial for ensuring cost-effectiveness of programs and contextual sustainability. Additionally, there is clear interest from the private sector for many reasons (Hancock et al., 2011; Sturchio and Goel, 2012). For multina tional companies, keeping their workforce healthy and productive will improve their bottom lin e. For those companies in the health sector, there is an opportunity to create a market for themselves in LMICs that have a high burden of NCDs. Creating health systems that enable robust and sustainable care delivery will also improve the sustainability and growth of their company's business. For these reasons, the committee feels that optimizing available resources and stakehol ders through changes in health system design will to be highly effective for improving cardiovascular health and preventing cancer, as explored in sections below. Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States PROMOTING CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH AND PREVENTING CANCER 6-15 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Integration of Services at the Community Level The dual burden of NCDs and infectious diseases in LMICs is exacerbated by well- documented interactions between communicable and noncommunicable diseases. For example, TB has been linked to an increased risk for str oke (Sheu et al., 2010) and lung cancer (Simonsen et al., 2014; Yu et al., 2011). Similarly, HIV/AIDS has been linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (Hsue et al ., 2012), in part due to the transi tion of HIV/AIDS as a chronic condition and AIDS patients now ofte n living to old age (Rabkin et al., 2012), and side effects of antiretroviral therapy (Subbaraman et al., 2007). HI V/AIDS also has been linked to a specific set of cancers (Grulich et al., 2007). Cervical cancer, for example, is four to five times more common in women who are HIV positive (PEPFAR, n.d.). With these examples in mind, the traditional siloed, disease-specific care system will be hard pressed to address both communicable dise ase and NCDs if done in isolation. Given that patients often suffer from both kinds of diseases, the effectiveness of he alth programs can be increased by integrating services\u2014a n approach that would seek to share locations, staff, systems, tools, and strategies (Rabkin et al., 2012). Such integration has been found to be successful in varying locations and approaches, with examples described in Box 6-2. BOX 6-2 Case Studies on Integration of Services for Communicable and Noncommunicable Diseases Integrating Cardiovascular Disease Care into Existing Tuberculosis and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Programs in South Africa Developed by the University of Cape Town Lung Institute, the Practical Approach to Care Kit (PACK) aims to empower front-line nurses where resources are scarce. Though originally designed to improve access to diagnoses and tr eatment for people with tuberculosis and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), PACK was expanded to include a number of chronic conditions\u2014 including CVD. Since its inception, PACK has contributed to consistent improvements in health outcomes for patients\u2014for both communicable and noncommunicable conditions. As a result of its success, PACK is being adapted and implemented in Malawi, The Gambia, Brazil, Mexico, and Botswana. HIV/Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (HIV/AIDS)-Hypertension Integrated Care in Cambodia Cambodia struggles with an increasing burden of chronic diseases, with 12 to15 percent of the population being hypertensive. To address this is sue, the Cambodian Ministry of Health and M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res established clinics to integrate chronic care (for hypertension and diabetes) with HIV/AIDS care in Takeo and Siem Reap. This not only resulted in an increased inflow of patients\u2014indicating a desire for integrat ed services\u2014but it also improved the health of patients. Through the combined services, hypertensive patients were able to reach healthy blood pressure targets of 160/90 mm Hg. This success signified the feasibility of providing integrated services and the adaptability of medical staff to assume a multidisciplinary role. Integrating HIV/AIDS Care and Cervical Cancer Prevention in Zambia Zambia has seen positive dividends from concerted efforts to train middle-level health practitioners in screening methods for early signs of cervical cancer. The World Health Organization's endorsement in 2013 of the screening method known as VIA (visual inspection Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States 6-16 GLOBAL HEALTH AND THE FUTURE ROLE OF THE UNITED STATES PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS with acetic acid) and cryotherapy-based \"screen and treat\" programs prompted questions on how to scale these services without a correlating vertical disease program. An evaluation of approaches to scale up the Cervical Cancer Prevention Program in Zambia found that successful expansion could be achieved by leveraging HIV/AIDS program investments to address the high burden of cervical disease at a population level. Researchers also found that focusing on the provision of services for high-ri sk HIV-infected women initially gave the program firm support within the HIV platform, but it did not preclude progression or expansion of the program to HIV-uninfected women in the community. Researchers noted that using existing infrastructure for screening implementation will have a positive effect on costs, expertise, and sustainability. SOURCES: Janssens et al., 2007; Parham et al., 2016. PEPFAR\u2014a well-known successful investment\u2014offers a unique opportunity for such integration. Along with the George W. Bush Institute, the Susan G. Komen Foundation, UNAIDS, and other partners, PEPFAR initiate d the Pink Ribbon Red Ribbon (PRRR) campaign in 2011 (PRRR, n.d.). Since then, PRRR has screened thousands of women for cervical and breast cancer and provided HPV vaccinations (see Box 6-3). Continuing this vision of cross- services, PEPFAR entere d into a public-private partne rship with AstraZeneca in 2016 called Healthy Heart Africa, which integrat es HIV infection reduction programs with hypertension screening targeting older men, a cohort often missed by standard HIV efforts (AstraZeneca, 2016). These types of focused part nerships featuring complementary goals and overlapping patient populations offe r great opportunity to expand th e reach and effectiveness of existing U.S. global health programs. BOX 6-3 Impacts of the Pink Ribbon Red Ribbon Initiative Partnership countries for the Pink Ribbon Red Ribbon initiative include Botswana, Ethiopia, Tanzania, and Zambia. As of 2016, 119,192 girls have received all doses of human papillomavirus vaccine, 341,863 women have rece ived basic screening for cervical cancer, 24,478 women have been treated with cryotherapy or LEEP* for cervical cancer, and 17,944 women have been screened for breast cancer. * LEEP = Lo op electrosurgical excision procedur e SOURCE: PRRR, 2016. Decentralizing Services at the Community Level Complementing the shift towards integration, the infrastructure and systems of LMICs must be transformed to meet the changing nation al health profiles in th e long-term. While this will take time and sustained effort, there are shor t-term methods that can increase the capacity of countries to better address th e burden of NCDs, including a broader use of the existing workforce. A 2015 assessment of community health workers in Bangladesh, Guatemala, Mexico, and South Africa found that health workers wi thout formal professional training can be adequately trained to effectively screen for and identify people with a high risk of cardiovascular disease (Gaziano et al., 2015). Tr aining existing staff to perform new tasks could free up the higher-level trained professionals to focus on those tasks requiring greater expertise. The concept Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States PROMOTING CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH AND PREVENTING CANCER 6-17 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS of task shifting more generally has been found to be feasible in the management of hypertension and reducing cardiovascular risk (Poulter et al., 2 015). This concept has also been successfully applied in cancer screen ing; the cervical cancer screening pr ogram in Zambia discussed in Box 6-2 promoted task shifting from doctors to nurses and used mobile technology to fill in any gaps and improve decision making (Parham et al., 2015). Box 6-4 provides an example of a community-based approach, including task -shifting to address CVD management. BOX 6-4 Case Study: The Need for Innovative Community-Based Approaches to Cardiovascular Disease Management and Control The prevalence of hypertension in Ghana was recently estimated at 27 percent of the population, but only 4 percent of patients control their condition. An international public-private partnership is leading the evaluation and cost-effectiveness analysis of a community-based hypertension program (ComHIP) in a district in Ghana as an important contribution to the development of evidence-based innovative approaches to the management of noncommunicable diseases in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Individuals from the Novartis Foundation, the Ghana Health Service, FHI360, the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, and the School of Public Heal th of the University of Ghana comprise the research team. Other local collaborators include the Ministry of Health, Ghana National Health Insurance Scheme, Ghana College of Physicians & Surgeons, Ghana Medical and Dental Council, the Pharmacy Council, Licensed Chemic al Sellers Association, and Ghana Nursing Board. This innovative, community-based and te chnologically driven approach has the potential to enhance the delivery of affordable and effective approaches to hypertension management and control in LMIC. Project Aims: Enhance the capacity of the Ghana Health Service through task shifting and innovative technology solutions to improve access to quality and affordable services for hypertension and other CVDs. The project also aims to improve the capacity of patients in managing their own conditions and risk factors. Program Components: Health services strengthening: Strengthening private- and public-sec tor capacity and collaboration to manage hypertension, including the establishment of a direct referral linkage between the public health system and private drug outlets. Task shifting : 1.Shifting screening and monitoring of blood pressure from health facilities to community health officers and private drug outlets . 2.Shifting management of moderate and noncomplicated hypertension from doctors to community-based nurse s. 3.Shifting dispensing of blood pressure medication from pharmacists to pr ivate drug outlets. Self-management: Empowering patients to self-manage hypertension and control othe r CVD risk factors.

All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States 6-18 GLOBAL HEALTH AND THE FUTURE ROLE OF THE UNITED STATES PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Leveraging Private- Sector Involvement Multin ational companies understand the value of a healthier workforce in terms of increased productivity. In addition to being able to work for a greater number of years before retirement (and thus, spending more time contribu ting to society and less time deriving benefits from social welfare systems), healthier people ar e able to achieve higher-quality results in a shorter time period (Bloom et al., 2011). Decades of work through existing platforms, such as those established by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), PEPFAR, and others, have enabled U.S. global health programs to build strong international, national, and community-level networks. Leveraging this U.S. knowledge base and infrastructure, and creating an environment conducive to catalytic, innovative support and partnerships, can lead to mo re sustainable programs and improved outcomes. However, according to an insights report from the World Economic Forum's Future of Health project, the willingness of the private and public sectors to coinvest depends on the right investment mechanisms being in place, on there being proof that those returns will materialize, and on the existence of a business model that makes it pos sible to share the bene fits (WEF, 2015). This willingness has been growing in recent years a nd the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in 2017, a collaborative initiative among more than 20 compan ies\u2014Access Accelerated\u2014was launched. Fifty million was initially committed to improve access to NCD prevention, care, and treatment, in partnership with the Union of International Ca ncer Control and the World Bank (Access Accelerated, n.d.; IP Watch, 2017). There is potential to capitalize on this willingness and interest from the private sector to augment the current knowledge base and infrastructure to advance NCD efforts globally. The committee believes the United States s hould build on such shared commitments and is poised to assist other companies and multilatera l groups in contributing to the advancement of progress against NCDs. Although th e existing U.S. vertical platforms can be leveraged for integrating services and expanding the scope of the current workforce, there will likely be difficulty and opposition to using existing funds to purchase commodities for treating international patients with conditions such as hypertension, which is often a manifestation of behavior choices. However, public -private partnerships presen t unique opportunities and have already demonstrated successful results in ma ny areas. Consider the previous example of PEPFAR and AstraZeneca's partnership, as we ll as PEPFAR's Determined, Resilient, Empowered, AIDS-free, Mentored, and Safe Women (DREAMS) initiative, where a pharmaceutical company is purchasing medicatio n for treatment in young women who are not eligible for coverage under PEPFAR. Additionally, the practi ce of matching resources to incentivize private involvement has also proven useful for PEPFAR programs in the past, by leveraging established supply chains and develo ping reference laboratories (Sturchio and Cohen, information management.

This method has been recommended for maternal and child health issues, and could easily be applied to NCD-fo cused partnerships. Health companies have a vested interest in reaching the populations throughout LMICs that suffer from CVDs and cancers. Because thes e populations may not have access to the right medications because of either syst emic or financial barriers, there is a gap that can draw mutual interest. If companies can crea te opportunities for larger numbers of people to purchase and depend on their medications, vaccines, and devices, th ey can eventually translate that increase to larger profits and sustainable business growth. Many companies have alre ady invested their own resources in curbing the human and cost burden of NCDs in many countries (explored in more detail in Chapter 8). As an overview of the breadth of this private sector interest, Table 6-5 gives examples of companies already investing in re ducing the burden of CV Ds and cancers, amongst other NCDs, around the world, th rough their own motivation.5 Finding: Integration, decentral ization of services at the community level, and public-private partnerships are promising methods for transforming health systems in LMICs to provide better ca re for patients suffering from NCDs. TABLE 6-5 : Private Companies Investing Their Own Resources in NCDs in Developing Countries Comp any Disea se Targ et Impact AstraZeneca Hypertension Through Healthy Heart Africa, AstraZeneca aimed to reach 10 million people with treatment for hypertension by 2025. By 2015, it had screened over 1 million people (AstraZeneca, 2015). Novartis Access Program CVD, diabetes, breast cancer, and respiratory illnesses Novartis Access portfolio includes 15 on and off-patent medicines addressing CVD, type 2 diabetes, breast cancer, and respiratory illnesses. It is offered as a basket to countries for $1/treatment/ month. Its goal is to provide access to 20 million patients annually by 2020 (Novartis, n.d.).

SUMMARY AND RE COMMENDATION NCDs, such as CVD, COPD, and lung cancer , kill 40 million people annually, almost three-quarters of whom are in low- and mi ddle-income countries (WHO, 2017b). CVD is the leading cause of death worldwide, killing 18 million people in 2015. In addition, 14 million people are diagnosed with cancer each year, lead ing to 8.8 million deaths in 2015 (Stewart and Wild, 2014). In LMICs, more people die from cancer than from AIDS, TB, and malaria combined (Ferlay et al., 2013; WHO, 2014). NCDs are projected to cause cumulative global economic output lo sses of $47 trillion by 2030, approximately 75 percent of the 2010 global GDP. The global cost of CVD alone was estimated at $906 billion in 2015, and it is projected to rise to more than $1 trillion annually in 2030 (Reddy et al., 2016). Global cancer costs are expected to reach $8.3 trillion annually by 2030, yet investing in cancer care and control coul d result in millions of avoidable deaths and up to $200 billion in global savings (Stewart and Wild, 2014). With similar rising human and economic burdens in the United States, U.S. global health programs have a clear opportunity to address thes e conditions that contri bute to an enormous global disease burden. However, NCDs often ar e incorporated into other programs as an afterthought, and an overall coordination mechanis m or strategy for these diverse diseases is lacking. U.S. global health programs have esta blished strong networks and knowledge bases in countries as a result of decades of effort by various agencies through infectious disease and maternal and child health platforms. There is an opportunity to inte grate NCD prevention and care into these established platforms. Private, multinational companies also are becoming more invested in addressing chronic di seases, and there is an opportunity to leverage th ese established networks and this private-sector interest to develop coordina ted public-private partnerships focused on high-impact, evidence-based interventions. Conclusion: Without intervention, the burden of NCDs will grow in both epidemiological and economic terms. Th is burden of disease will have massive adverse effects on societies of all income levels, including high rates of premature death and lost productivity that will reverse trends of improved economic growth and stability in many countries. Conclusion: Global health programs are not devoting adequate attention to the promotion of cardiovascular heal th and prevention of cancer. National governments, donor governments, and NGOs need to address these priorities through policy changes, vaccination agains t vaccine-preventa ble cancers, and programs that are community based and inte grated into existing health services. Conclusion: The private sector has st rong interest in addressing NCDs globally owing to their clear effects on workfor ce productivity, but such private-sector efforts are not synergized across countries or health systems.

Recommendation 9: Promote Cardiovas cular Health and Prevent Cancer The U.S. Agency for International Development, the U.S. Department of State, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, through their country offices, should provide seed funding to facilitate the mobilization and involvement of the private sector in addressing cardiovascular disease and cancer at the country level. These efforts should be closely aligned and coordinated with the efforts of national governments and should strive to integrate services at the community level. The priority strategies to ensure highest impact are target and manage risk factors (e.g., smoking, alcohol use, obesity) for the major noncommunicable diseases, particularly through theadoption of fiscal policies and regulations that facilitate tobacco control and healthy diets; detect and treat hypertension early; detect and treat early cervical cancer; and immunize for vaccine-preventable cancers (specifically human papilloma virus and hepatitis B vaccines).Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Given the multisectoral nature of health, simply addressing individual challenges in a singular, siloed manner will never solve the overall problem. Challenges in the drug de velopment process for infectious and neglected diseases have plagued researchers and devel opers since before human im munodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV /AIDS) captivated the world's attention in the 1980s. But since then, the challenges have only expanded\u2014many infectious dis eases still plague the world without an effective cure or v accine, and many chronic conditi ons or noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) face limited treatment options. The committee believes that, through innovations and the development of partnerships, critical medical product development can be accelerated and public health services can be provided in a more sustainable manner. Furthermore, the ex traordinary advances in information technology have the potential to revolutionize global health and bypass the necessity of costly brick-and- mortar health services. This chapter provides examples and strategi es to catalyze these innovations to improve health outcomes, by first discus sing the various ways to accelerate the development of medical products. This includes addressing multiple steps along the value chain, such as enabling innovative trial designs, streamlining regulati on, ensuring both the supply and demand through manufacturing capacity and market incentives, a nd finally building research and development (R&D) capacity in LMICs. The chap ter then proceeds to review pr ogress in digital health tools and uses worldwide, highlights re maining gaps, and charts a path forward for the United States to better support global health investments through technology. ENABLING INNOVATION: ACCELERA TING DEVELOPMENT OF MEDICAL PRODUCTS The market for global health products suffers numerous failures\u2014including lack of manufacturing capacity, a costly approval process, uncertain co mmercial potential, and poor workforce and laboratory capacities in LMIC s. From 1975 to 1999, only 1.1 percent of new drugs were developed for neglec ted diseases. Given the intern ational support and political attention resulting from the Millennium Development Goals 1 in 2000 it would be expected that this percentage would climb. However, betw een 2000 and 2011, only 4 percent of new products were indicated for neglected diseases2 (Pedrique et al., 2013 ). This dearth of available medical 1 The Millennium Development Goals are \"The world's time-bound and quantified targets for addressing extreme poverty in its many dimensions\u2014income poverty, hunger, disease, lack of adequate shelter, and exclusion\u2014while promoting gender equality, education, and environmental sust ainability. They are also basic human rights-the rights of each person on the planet to health, education, shelter, and security\" (Millennium Project, 2006). 2 For this analysis, the term neglected diseases includes 49 different diseases in five categories: malaria, tuberculosis, diarrheal diseases, the WHO list of 17 neglected tropical diseases, or othe r neglected diseases (19 of which did not fit into another category). See supplementary appendix of Pedrique et al. (2013) for a detailed listing. Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States 7-2 GLOBAL HEALTH AND THE FUTURE ROLE OF THE UNITED STATES PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS products results in patients suffering from dis eases, such as tuberculosis, malaria, and other potential pandemic diseases, without access to essential medicines. Though there are many promising process innovations, the entire value ch ain for global health products needs re-tooling. The committee considered a variety of means to streamline the R&D pipeline for global health products and offers strategies that government ag encies, industry, and glob al health players can explore. These include enabling innovative tria l design approaches; st reamlining regulation; ensuring supply; creating market incentives; a nd increasing capacity building for medical products manufacturing in partner countries to fo ster global health secu rity and better support local needs. Enabling Innovative Trial Design Approaches Traditional clinical trials , though the mainstay of clin ical research, often have shortcomings because of their rigidity or poor adap tability of results in real-life circumstances. For example, randomized clinical trials (RCTs) may require a large sample size and lengthy study duration (Bhatt and Mehta, 2016). In part b ecause of these requirements, the costs of drug development have increased nearly 100-fo ld between 1950 and 2010, when adjusting for inflation, despite fewer new drugs being appr oved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The core problem of clinical trials seems to be that pro cesses that support them have not been improved (Pammolli et al., 2011; Woodcock and Woosley, 2008). The committee believes that the costly drug development process c ould be improved to re duce costs and attract pharmaceutical companies to develop more products needed for neglected global health diseases. One way of accomplishing this goal is through the encouragement of manufacturers to use more innovative product development approaches that imp rove the effectiveness and efficiency of the clinical trial process. Three a pproaches emerged in recent years and include adaptive clinical trials, pragmatic clinical trials, and surrogate endpoints (or biomarkers). Adaptive Trial Designs Clinical trials are often hi ndered by the rigidity of the pr otocols. A traditional RCT may not offer the flexibility necessary to modify its study design based on interim data that emerges as a trial progresses (Mahajan and Gupta, 2010). An alternative approach to a traditional RCT, the adaptive clinical trials method embraces more flexibility and efficiency, which provides manufacturers the opportunity to modify the st udy design and hypotheses based on the analysis of interim data (FDA, 2010), as well as possibly shortening the development time to speed up the process (Chow and Corey, 2011). Among other benef its, this method of ad aptive design allows a more rapid divestment from unsuccessful co mpounds without wasting as much time or resources. Importantly, though adaptive trials seek to make clinical research more efficient, they still involve randomization 3 (Mahajan and Gupta, 2010). An additional adaptive method, the use of platform trials, are appea ling because of their potential improved efficiency in creating superior evidence compared to single-sponsor, single-drug trials (Tru sheim et al, 2016). A 3 Randomization in clinical trials means the random assignment of participants to treatment groups, which contributes to the efficacy and internal validity of a trial. Forms of randomiza tion include simple randomization, in addition to block, stratified, and covariate adaptive randomization. Specific types of randomization used in adaptive trials are described by (Mahajan and Gu pta, 2010). As each type has its advantages and disadvantages clinical trial teams will need to assess the context surrounding the trial before determining which type of randomization to use.

All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States CATALYZING INNOVATION 7-3 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS platform trial is a clinical trial with a single mast er protocol that can evaluate multiple treatments simultaneously, and can result in fewer pati ent failures and a shorter timeline\u2014improving overall financial sustainability (Saville and Berry, 2016). While there are many benefits to be realized, conducting these types of trials e ffectively will require overcoming many operational and statistical challenges, such as coordinati ng multiple sponsoring companies in collaborative governance and ensuring standardized protocols are followed supported by adequate data sharing (Trusheim et al., 2016). While FDA has issued draft guidance on the us e of adaptive clinical trials (FDA, 2010), there is still lack of clarity on how they would be evaluated. Ho wever, with the passing of the 21st Century Cures Act in 2016,4 FDA has been directed to host a public meeting to discuss the incorporation of complex adaptive and other novel trial designs in to clinical protocols and new drug applications as well as to issue add itional guidance regarding their use (Brennan, 2016b). This could potentially set up a more efficient, yet safe environment conducive to accelerating development for certain diseases. Despite the promise of adaptive tria ls though, there can be several operational challenges such as pre- planning protocol devi ations, complicated mathematical modeling, and the risk of false effectiveness conclusions (Chow and Corey, 2011; FDA, 2016a). These challenges will require conti nued evaluation when designing trials within this adaptive and accelerated environment. Pragmatic Trials In addition to the rigidity of their protocol s, traditional RCTs, through strict control for biases, produce results that are statistically cred ible but not always appl icable to real life circumstances such as demographics of the tria l population, proximity to a study site, or patient adherence (Zwarenstein and Oxman, 2006). However, the use of \"real-world-evidence,\" such as electronic health r ecords, medical claims data, disease registries, and data gathered through personal devices, can complement the knowledge ga ined from clinical trials. As a result, researchers and medical product ma nufacturers have expressed intere st in integrating such real world settings into clinical re search (Sherman et al., 2016). As a result, pragmatic trials have emerged as a mechanism to incorporate such data into clinical trials so interventions are tested in the full range of clinical setti ngs and the findings are more ge neralizable (Patsopoulos, 2011) to close the gap between research and care. Re quirements for pragmatism are described by the PRECIS-2 tool,5 but overall pragmatic trials involve he terogeneity of part icipants and study settings in addition to numerous interacting components, such as other medications or health conditions participants may ha ve (Ford and Norrie, 2016; Patsopoulos, 2011). Though pragmatic trials seek to relax the control aspect of a clinical trial,6 they also still use randomization (Ford and Norrie, 2016) and often require a larger sample size as a result of the increased heterogeneity (Patsopoulos, 2011). Researchers should adopt featur es of pragmatic trials where feasible, but refrain if there are questi ons of trial quality compro mise (Ford and Norrie, 2016). Pragmatic trials and the use of real world data have been encouraged by the U.S. government, and future expanded use of this tria l type looks promising. The American Recovery 4 See https://www.congress.gov/ bill/114th-congress/ house-bill/34 (accessed April 6, 2017). 5 The PRECIS-2 tool includes dimensions of investigator and participant eligibility, recruitment, and setting; the organization of the intervention; the flexibility in delivery and adherence of the intervention; the nature of the follow-up; and the determination and analysis of the primary outcome (Ford and Norrie, 2016). 6 A controlled trial is a type of clinical trial in which obse rvations made during the tria l are compared to a standard, called the control. The control may be observations of a grou p of participants in the same trial or observations from outside the trial\u2014for example, from an earlier tria l, which is called a historical control (NLM, 2017).

And with the passing of the 21st Century Cures Act, FDA is now required to develop a framework on evaluating real world evidence for drug regulation to guide its use in clinical trials (Hills and Zegarelli, 2017). However, pragmatic trials may present new challenges, such as participant recruitment and consen t, practice variation, or risk determination (Anderson et al., 2015; Ford and Norrie, 2016; Sugarman and Califf, 2014), all of which will demand continued dialogue among multiple stakeholders to adequately address the scientific, ethical, and regulatory challenges. Biomarkers as Surrogate Endpoints The primary outcome of a clinical tria l is known as a clin ical endpoint, and it characterizes whether or not a pa rticipant develops a symptom, disease, laboratory anomaly, or even death in response to the disease course or treatment under study. While these are clear metrics for the success or failure of a treatment, some may occur years after the end of a trial. The use of biomarkers 7 that can provide interim evidence about safety and effectiveness is an advancement in clinical resear ch that addresses this issue, and therefore speeds up the drug development process. Establishing a biomarker as a surrogate endpoint,8 however, is difficult and requires strong eviden ce to validate its use.9 As a result, FDA approves the use of biomarkers as surrogate endpoints on a provisional basis, requiring phase IV10 studies to prove correlation. It is important to not e that even defined biomarkers may not always be an indicator of a clinical endpoint, and are likely to draw erroneous conc lusions (Strimbu and Tavel, 2010). Thus, while biomarkers may improve the efficiency of clinical trials and their use has been encouraged by FDA (FDA, 2004), they must be fu rther developed to improve their reliability. Encouraging researchers to identify biomarkers for us e could be an integral step in this process, as this method will be difficult for the FDA to review and assist without active participation through proposed biomarkers in relevant resear ch. The committee hopes that, in compliance with the 21st Century Cures Act, FDA provides guida nce on a review pathway (Brennan, 2016b) and collaborates with scientific partners to develop qu alification plans. This w ould ensure a safe path forward for more rapid product development processes. Communicating in Crisis A trial design may use a combination of th ese approaches depending upon the disease in question. As a result, early co mmunication among researchers a nd regulators around the globe is vital to clarify the best approach and ensure st udy success. In fact, a 2017 National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine report, Integrating Clinical Research into Epidemic Response , noted that international researchers missed the opportunity to quickly and collaboratively come to an agreement on tria l design, which stalled e fforts (NASEM, 2017a). 7 Biomarker: A substance, structure, or process that can be measured and influence or predict a clinical outcome or disease (WHO, 2001). 8 Surrogate Endpoint: A well-characterized biomarker that can act as a substitute for a clinical endpoint (Strimbu and Tavel, 2010). 9 Strong scientific evidence must show that a biomarker be objectively measured, strongly correlates with the clinical endpoint, has predictive power in other related studie s, and that it can be relied upon to serve as a surrogate in other related clinical endpoints (Strimbu and Tavel, 2010). 10 Phase IV studies are done after the drug or treatment has been marketed to ga ther information on the drug's effect in various populations and any associated side-effects following long-term use.

All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States CATALYZING INNOVATION 7-5 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Furthermore, Peter Marx, director of the Center for Biologics Ev aluation and Research at FDA, discussed early conversations of regulators with trial spons ors and suggested it could be beneficial to bring the scientif ic community and international regulators together during an international health emergency to review the re sults available from differing trial designs. Overall, all of these trial designs present alte rnative options to be explored, but continued investment and dedication from all parties, including regulators, industry, and academic researchers, will be needed to continue to shape the trials to produce safe and efficacious medical products and as efficiently as possible. Streamlining Regulation As the oldest consumer protection agency in the United States, FDA requires drug manufacturers to prove the safety and efficacy of products before they enter the market, and continues these safety evalua tions through post-market survei llance (Danzis, 2003; Merrill, 1996). Although the process of drug approval protects consumers, it is complex and costly, and it can take 12 to 15 years for a new drug to be de veloped and enter the market (see Figure 7-1). Furthermore, this process is a risky investmen t: the average cost of developing a drug is over $2.5 billion (DiMasi et al., 2016), and only 9.6 per cent of all new drugs successfully progress from Phase 1 clinical trials to FDA approval (T homas et al., 2015). Of a ll new drugs intended for infectious diseases, 19.1 percen t are approved (Thomas et al., 2015). Private companies decide which products they will invest in based on a risk assessment to their business and potential for financial return. If a company believes the cost s and risks for development are too high, or the market for the product is too uncertain and small, i nvestment in this product is unlikely to occur. FIGURE 7-1: Timeline for drug or vaccine development. SOURCES: Adapted from Ciociola et al., 2014; Thaul, 2012. To partially alleviate the gap in development for global health priorities, the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDE R), the division of FDA tasked with overseeing the approval process, offers a variety of a lternative review mechanisms th at can reduce costs and risks by speeding up the timeline. Typically, CDER is exp ected to review and act on 90 percent of new drug applications within 10 months. However, CDER employs four different regulatory mechanisms for expedited review: fast-track, breakthrough therapy, accel erated approval, and priority review, as described in Box 7-1. The ex pedited review mechanisms are an example of how the U.S. government can reduce or share th e burden of development costs and risks with industry, effectively \"pushing\" a product through the pipeline.

Drugs may be eligible for accelerated approval and priority review (discussed below), if criteria for those mechanisms are also met. This designation was used during the West Africa Ebola outbreak and it is the only FDA expedited review mechanism that is applicable to investigational products with only preclinical data. Breakthrough Therapy The breakthrough therapy mechanism expedites the development and review of new drugs that target serious conditions and suggest, based on clinical evidence, an improvement over available therapy. A manufacturer can request designation for a product no later than phase 2 clinical trials. Manufacturers with this designation receive all fast-track designation features and intensive guidance and commitment on behalf of FDA. Accelerated Approval The accelerated approval mechanism allows for a faster FDA approval process for drugs that are proven to treat a serious condition, provide meaningful advantage over currently available therapies, and demonstrate an effect based on a surrogate endpoint (a biomarker intended to substitute for a clinical endpoint).While this allows manufacturers to receive FDA approval faster, they need to confirm the initial results or risk losing approval. Priority Review To receive priority review, a manufacturer must show that their product represents an improvement in the safety or effectiveness of a treatment or has been designated as a qualified infectious disease product. Though not required by law, FDA by practice assigns priority review status to drugs that address an unmet need. Priority review shortens the length of FDA review from 10 to 6 months. SOURCES: Aronson, 2005; FDA, 2014a, b,c; Thaul, 2012; Williams, 2016. In addition to expedited review, in order to address the under-prioritization of global health priorities, Congress has im plemented mechanisms related to regulation to incentivize industry partners to develop needed products that may not have a clear commercial market. Examples include the Orphan Drug Act, the Priority Review Voucher (PRV), and the Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now (GAIN) Act, describe d in the section below. While each mechanism has elements designed to attract manufacturers, they have not been used as widely as needed to have a clear effect on the dearth of critical products. The committee believes that this is partially because these incentives do not compensate enough for the costs of regulatory approval, and sees an opportunity for reassessment and expansion of these mechanisms to further streamline the approval process for critical global health products. Orphan Drug Act The Orphan Drug Act of 1983 was introduced to incentivize drug development for rare diseases 11 by providing pharmaceutical companies a 7-ye ar market exclusivity, a tax credit that covers 50 percent of clinical trial costs, R&D gran ts, fast-track approval, a nd a waiver of the user fee associated with the applic ation (Franco, 2013). As of November 2013, FDA has granted 2923 11 Rare diseases are defined as those that affect 200,000 patients or less, or those that affect more but for which drug development costs are unlikely to be recovered in the United States.

The diseases receiving orphan designation have mostly been cancers with relatively few of them being neglected diseases. Those neglecte d diseases that have been given orphan status, such as malaria, tuberculosis, and leishmania sis (Sachs-Barrable et al., 2014), are mostly prevalent among the U.S. military and travelers (Villa et al., 2009). Because the Orphan Drug Act was developed to address diseases in domestic markets (Villa et al., 2009) and neglected infectious diseases typically affect the world's poorest, most pharmaceutical companies do not frequently pursue drug development for thes e diseases through th is act (Warshaw, 2015). Leveraging the Orphan Drug Act to spur developmen t for neglected diseases has been suggested, with one solution proposed in a past bill (H R 3156) submitted to the 111th Congress in 2009 12 met with little success. In 2014 multiple candidate s to treat the Ebola virus were given orphan drug designation, but this does not guarantee the drug will be developed as some companies were hesitant to start the process unt il they had secured additional funding through a partnership or government (Lyon, 2015; Radke, 2014). This further highlights the need for sustainable, collaborative investment for neglected diseases. Priority Review Voucher Program The PRV program was established in 2007 and designed to reward innovators for developing novel treatments for diseases that woul d otherwise not attract development interest. While initially intended for neglected diseases, additional PRV programs have since been created to include rare pediatric diseas es in 2012 (Gaffney et al., 2016) and medical countermeasures in 2016 (Brennan, 2016a). In exchange for producin g drugs for such diseases, FDA grants manufacturers a voucher that allows them to designate another product in their pipeline for priority review (Aurora et al., 2016). If manufacturers have pote ntial blockbuster drugs in their pipeline, the ability to enter market even 4 months in advance could translate into millions of dollars in profit. As of November 2016, 13 vouc hers had been awarded\u20144 of which were for drugs treating neglected (or tropical) diseases (Gaffney et al ., 2016). Furthermore, there are currently three products in the pipeline for this category\u2014motivated by a PRV\u2014targeting river blindness, tuberculosis, and dengue fever (Aurora et al., 2016). While the PRV program has some novel aspects to incentivize drug development for neglected diseases, such as permitting FDA to add ne w pathogens to the list of eligible diseases \"by order,\" 13 there are concerns about its effectiveness and whether the program is being exploited. The first PRVs granted for neglected dis ease were either already developed or in late- stage of development, leading some to questi on whether it is indeed incentivizing development or just acting as a giveaway to companies who were already doing that t ype of work. Further, PRVs have been sold to other companies, ofte n commanding high prices. Th e first ever sale was valued at $67 million, with subsequent vouchers being sold as high as $350 million (Gaffney et al., 2016). The most recent voucher was sold for $125 million (Brennan, 2017). Other concerns raised about the PRV program include the uncerta inty that the drug will be approved, taken to 12 Congress. 2009.

Finally, there are lim itations in the application as only novel ingredients are eligible, so inno vations in delivery such as follow-up formulations th at can be applied to resource poor settings would not qualify (Kesselheim, 2008). These concerns notwithstan ding, the PRV program should be seen as one beneficial tool in the \"incentiv es toolbox,\" but would benefit fr om re-evaluation, and assurance that FDA has the appropriate resources n eeded to optimally manage the program. Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now Act In contrast with the Orphan Drug Act and the PRV program, the GAIN Act does not address a rare or neglected disease, but still fills an unmet need. As discussed in Chapter 3, the dire health and economic challenges that antimicrobial resistance poses, in addition to the dwindling pipeline for new antimicrobials, makes it essen tial to spur development. This is compounded by the high cost of bringing a new medicine to market, especially when antimicrobials generate such small revenue compared to other drugs. Th e GAIN Act encourages the development of new products targeting \"qualifying pathogens\"14 by awarding an additional 5 years of market exclusivity, priority review, a nd eligibility for fast-track de signation. In addition, the GAIN Act requires FDA to provide clarity on the devel opment pathway of these therapeutics (Pew Charitable Trusts, 2013). As of September 2016, 40 new antimicrobials are in clinical development for U.S. market, many of which addr ess indications eligible for GAIN Act benefits (Pew Charitable Trusts, 2016). Ensuring Supply Enabling the efficient development of me dical products and streamlining regulatory processes to facilitate a faster timeline is only half the challenge of ensuring drugs, vaccines, and devices reach people in a timely manner. There is a need in the latter stages of development to ensure adequate manufacturing capacity for thes e products to meet global demand. This is especially important for diseas es that might threaten the global population, such as pandemic influenza (reviewed in Chapter 3). The Biom edical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) within the Office of the A ssistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response understands this need and ha s been working through global partnerships to increase manufacturing capacity for thre ats within their mission, such as pandemic influenza. In 2005, there were fewer than 1 million doses of influenza vaccine available worldwide, which prompted a move to advance clinical development by at least 9 developing country vaccine manufacturers and licensure by at least 7 developing country manufacturers (Bright, 2013). In 2006, the Global Action Plan for Influen za Vaccines was implemented to increase capacity for manufacture and access to vacci nes in LMICs. From 2006 to 2013, seasonal vaccines production increased fr om 500 million to 1.5 billion doses and pandemic vaccines rose from 1.5 billion to 6.2 billion doses (McLean et al., 2016). In 2015, pandemic vaccine capacity 14 Following a final rule July 7, 2014, the list of qualifying pathogens includes: Acinetobacter species, \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States CATALYZING INNOVATION 7-9 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS continued to increase from 6.2 billion to 6.4 bill ion doses, but seasonal vaccine capacity dropped to below 1.5 billion doses, largely due to a shift towards more quadrivalent vaccine15 production and increased use of adjuvants16 (McLean et al., 2016). Since the pathogen that will cause the next pandemic is unknown, it would not be prudent to maintain ongoing capacity for every possible pa thogen with pandemic potential. Yet, due to severe consequences of a pandemic, unique mode ls are required to ensure supply of needed drugs, vaccines, and diagnostics. To help addres s this issue, in 2012 BARDA established three Centers for Innovation in Advanced Development and Manufacturing (CIADMs) that can transition quickly and cost effectively between products. CIADMs are public-private partnerships that bring together small bi otechnology companies, academia, and large pharmaceutical companies with continued focus on improving current initiatives and medical countermeasures to reduce risk, increase yiel d, and reduce life cycle costs through flexible manufacturing. These CIADMs support workfor ce development through training current and future industry and government sc ientists, and can also augment manufacturing surge capacity in a public health emergency (HHS, 2017). Acknowledging the need for a long-term commitment and outlook when developing and manufacturing medical products, government contracts with CIADMs can be renewed for up to 25 years. While this is a step in the righ t direction, they will not solve the problem entirely, and have yet to be tested by the next pandemic. Sustained commitment and awareness in this area is needed. Creating Market Incentives When working with the private sector, th e global health community and governm ents need to understand that companies are required to demonstrate a rati onal allocation of capital that provides the highest return on i nvestment. There are areas of mutual interest and the private sector is a necessary partner in global health R&D, but it cannot be expected to make investments without any expectation of a return. As far back as the 1997 IOM report America's Vital Interest in Global Health, experts have understood the need for public-private cooperation and development of incentives for the pharmaceutical , vaccine, and medical device industries to invest in R&D of products with risky or unfavorable markets. The 1997 report called for allowing multi-tiered pricing of drugs and vaccines , safeguarding intellectu al property rights, and increasing incentives for product development (IO M, 1997). The world has seen a huge amount of progress in this area in the last 20 years, and with the creation of BARDA in 2006, many types of incentives have been explored for medical countermeasure development, though a mixture of push17 and pull mechanisms.18 However, because many incentives include payments from the government to pharmaceutical companies, there is often a challenge in securing trust and buy-in from the public because of the optics of this type of relationship. 15 A quadrivalent vaccine is one that wo rks by stimulating an immune response against four different antigens, such as four different viruses or other microorganisms (NCI, n.d.). 16 An adjuvant is a substance that is formulated as part of a vaccine to enhance its ability to induce protection against infection. Adjuvants help activate the immune system, allowing the antigens\u2014pathogen components that elicit an immune response\u2014in vaccines to induce long -term protective immun ity (NIAID, 2015). 17 Push mechanisms incentivi ze industry by reducing the cost of R&D. These can include product development partnerships and direct research grants (Dimitri, 2012). 18 Pull mechanisms incentivize industry by creating a mark et demand, which can include tiered pricing, advanced market commitments, and prize funds (i.e., a payment conditional on producing the product) (Dimitri, 2012). Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States 7-10 GLOBAL HEALTH AND THE FUTURE ROLE OF THE UNITED STATES PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS There are general areas of consensus around pull incentives, such as the agreem ent on reducing market uncertainty by guaranteeing volumes and prices, and building in provisions for public health objectives. De-linkage models that separate price from R&D costs\u2014either full or partial\u2014are especially favored with regards to antibiotic developmen t because it guarantees returns on investments and removes the motivat ion to oversell the product (Renwick et al., 2016). Challenges with pull mechanisms exist because the political commitment needs to be sustained for several years, which is difficult to guarantee when government leaders can change every few years. Additional barriers exist because pull mechanisms, administered through appropriation funds, guarantee th at a product will be funded. Yet, if these products are funded and developed with U.S. taxpayer money and the di sease that they address never manifests as a threat, Congress will be skepti cal to fund future projects. Similarly, push mechanisms are difficult for the U.S. government to implement because of the extremely high costs of drug development, they would require a large infusion of money up front in order to incentivize involvement. In 2014 the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) report recommended a significant increase in ec onomic incentives for developing urgently needed antibiotics (PCAST, 2014). The report pr oposed the establishment of an antibiotic incentive fund to provide advanced market commitments, or ma rket guarantee, and milestone payments to reward developers. One new approve d antibiotic per year was estimated to require an annual investment of $800 million. Tiered pricing continues to be explored as a mechanism to expand access to affordable drugs and other health products. It has proven cr itical to the success of global immunization programs and expanded access to affordable vaccin es. This mechanism is more effective when market risk is low, for example, when there is an assured source of financing like Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance (Gavi); and when there is a competitive market with adequate production capacity. The success of tiered pr icing also depends on a tacit agreement of high and middle- income markets that poorest countries will receive lower prices. Finally, mechanisms that help ensure that the low tier prices are available only in those appr oved low-income countries and do not leak into higher-income markets are important. When these conditions can be met, tiered pricing is a valuable mechanism to maintain a viable market for industry while ensuring the critical product is still available to the poorest people (M oon et al., 2011). A Suite of Approaches Overall, an important takeaway for incentives is that there is no magic bullet solution, as different approaches will be necessary for different shortcomings in the market. As a result, there is a need to articulate and test a suite of options and incentive models with multiple key stakeholders, as market shaping often require s partnership and coordi nation, since different options will appeal differently based on comp any characteristics (USAID, 2014). The U.S. Agency for International Deve lopment (USAID) has conducted ma rket shaping for vital global health issues such as the latest Zika virus outbreak. To lower the risk and incentivize the private sector to accelerate the deve lopment of Zika diagnostics, USAID partnered with the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) to cr eate an advanced purchase commitment valued at $10 m illion (USAID, 2017). Considerations for incentive development will vary by stakeholder involve d (i.e. large pharmaceutical companies vs. small biotechnology companies), and the product or process being targ eted (i.e., emerging infectious diseases versus classic drug development). Regardless of the incentive used, it is important for stakeholders to act soon and adapt, as markets fluctuate consta ntly (USAID, 2014).

Research and Development Capacity There are many opportunities to accelerate drug development th rough regulatory and market incentives, more innovative trial de sign approaches, streamlined regulations, and adequate supply. Yet, building loca l capacity to conduct clinical tr ials in countries where these diseases are endemic is paramount. As the world faces new health threats that can more easily cross national borders, investing in global R&D will require expansion of local capabilities to anticipate new threats and augm ent opportunities for the develo pment of novel vaccines and therapeutics. As the economies of the world con tinue to grow, and many once-recipient countries begin to develop their own capacities for R&D, the role of the United States should also adapt. Why Invest in Foreign Country Capacity? True collaboration is vital to the success of R&D partnerships. They must be conceived through a clear understanding of the mutually understood benefits, re sulting in a truly reciprocal approach for all parties (Lucas, 2005). This model provides the basis for strong collaborations that will help to dually develop capacity in LMICs and support the United States' efforts to prevent global outbreaks. In their 2016 report on the U.S. government's role in R&D for global health, the Duke University's Global Health In stitute also emphasized the need to build R&D capabilities in countries receiving developmen t assistance for health (DAH). This 2016 report agreed with the Lancet Commission on Investing in Health that DAH funding should increasingly be spent on global f unctions for health (similar to th e concept of global public goods discussed in Chapter 8). One way to achieve this , the Duke team reported, is to increase the amount of DAH that is directed to individual countries to develop their own R&D capabilities\u2014 and suggested using Fogarty Intern ational Center at the National In stitutes of Health (NIH) as a mechanism (Yamey et al., 2017). Continuing research capacity abroad will allo w for the development of more drugs and therapeutics to address diseases that plague people in both the United St ates and LMICs. As an example, with the recent improvement in diplomatic relations with Cuba, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Cuba's Ministry of Public Health \"signed an umbrella accord that promises to make health a cornerston e of the new era of cooperation between the two countries\" (Keck, 2016). Already, this concept is becoming tangible as Cuba has promising treatments that can prevent the need for amputati on in patients with diabetes, which have been unavailable to Americans since 2006 due to a U.S. trade embargo. Cuba also has a promising lung cancer vaccine, CIMAvax, with early results suggesting improved survival and quality of life for many patients with non-small-cell lung can cer (Keck, 2016). Only since last year, when the United States lifted a medical embargo, has this type of collaboration been allowed. There is much to be learned by each country, and extrapol ating this example of partnership across the world, the United States has an opportunity to encourage information sharing and research collaboration amongst all health and medical researchers.

However, the labor pool that has experience working in the setting of the emergency can be sparse, whic h occurred during the Ebola response, making it difficult to integrate internati onal responders without local a nd contextual understanding. As labor cannot be supplied from international s ources indefinitely, developing the workforce capacity locally is a much needed solution.19 U.S.-based institutions ca n play a role in fostering the development of a strong R&D workforce in LMICs and greater country independence through academic partnerships. The more develope d institution provides the laboratory skills and expertise not available at th e less developed institution, and the less develo ped institution contributes with clinical and contextual knowledge (Lucas, 2005). For example, the Academic Model Providing Access to Health care (AMPATH), an Indiana Univ ersity - led initiative, has developed a partnership with Moi University in Kenya to provide 30 percent of medical students with financial aid to increase the number of Kenyan medical professionals (AMPATH, n.d.). This partnership supports the development of a lo cal workforce that will provide care to their own people, and also creates long- term mentorship opportunities fo r students and faculty with an interest in global health. 20 Programs like this can strengthen the local workforce to operate more independently and become global partners in health with donor countries. Although these types of partnerships can be costly to U.S.-based academic institutions, additional funding can be leveraged through the Fogarty International Center at NIH and USAID,21 which ensures sustainability of current projects and encourages collaborations in future projects. For example, Troy Moon at Va nderbilt University has collaborated with the University of Zambia to train doctorate-level researchers with an NIH-sponsored grant (Snyder, 2015). The goal of the project is to improve part nerships and mentorships among scientists to encourage technical independe nce among researchers in part nering countries (Snyder, 2015). Through another NIH-sponsored grant, Vanderbilt University is working with Tulane University and the Kenema Government Hospital in Sierra Leone to build capacity and training programs for researchers in the recently Ebola-affected countries so that they can soon write grant proposals and conduct their own clinical trials. In addition to becoming primary researchers, these foreign trainees gain the t echnical expertise to become advisors to Ministers of Health for aid programs such as the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), and can have much greater success in influencing policy than \"outsider\" research scientists and diplomats.22 U.S grants lower the barrier to entry for res earchers who hope to coll aborate with in-country universities in developing R&D workforce capacity sustainably. This type of capacity-building support through the Fogarty Center is widely used by many universities and provides learning and mentorship opportunities not otherwise available to U.S.-bas ed institutions and depended on by international universities to help build the research component of their country's health system. USAID has created multiple programs to le verage investments by U.S. government science agencies to strengthen the research ecos ystem in LMICs. For example, the Partnerships for Enhanced Engagement in Research (PEER) funds international scientists who work in partnership with inst itutions supported by U.S. federal sc ience agency funding (USAID, 2016b). 19 Personal communication with Daniel Bausch, Tulane University, November 9, 2016. 20 Personal communication with Robert Einterz, AMPATH, December 5, 2016. 21 Personal communication with Troy Moon, Vanderbilt University, November 8, 2016. 22 Personal communication with Troy Moon, Vanderbilt University, November 8, 2016.

A 2017 National Academies report The Role of Science, Technology, Innovation, and Partnerships in the Future of USAID called for continued engageme nt with partner countries through such innovative programs as PEER a nd HESN, and lessons should be gleaned and expanded to sustain collaborations with in -country researchers and institutions (NASEM, 2017b). With much success, PEPFAR has also expl ored methods for sustainable workforce training through the Medical Educa tion Partnership Initiative and Nursing Education Partnership Initiative, also supported by the F ogarty International Center and Health Resources and Services Administration (explained in Chapter 4). These in itiatives provide students with technical and diplomatic expertise and, in a similar way to Moon's projects, build robust academic partnerships with in-country institutions, creating more formal netw orks for bidirectional information sharing. Developing Laboratory Research Capacity In addition to the workforce capacity need ed for R&D in LMICs, building laboratory research capacity is another vital investment category. By increasing the ability to conduct research on endemic diseases, countries will be ab le to self-sufficiently implement appropriate solutions. Investments towards research capacity date back to 1974 when the World Health Organization (WHO) Special Progr amme for Research and Traini ng in Tropical Diseases (TDR) was established. Its support has be en instrumental for institution strengthening in LMICs. For example, TDR funding was able to create the Ma laria Research and Trai ning Center (MRTC) in Mali in 1998, which conducts extensive stud ies on vector biology, ecology, and genetics (Ogundahunsi et al., 2015). Owing to subsequent funding by USAID and NIH, the MRTC has since expanded and now is paired with multiple laboratories\u2014one of which is a Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3) lab (NIAID, 2014). To have ongoing benef its, both to the country and to the rest of the world, this laboratory capacity in LMICs must be sustained. Building laboratory capacity is critical for outbreak response, as the health research system is a vital component of a country's health system (NASEM, 2017a). As a recent example, when Ebola hit West Africa in late 2013, poor la boratory research capaci ty hindered efforts to quickly identify the source of the outbreak. The initial investigati on conducted by the Ministry of Health in Guinea concluded that the cause was cholera, which impeded a swift and appropriate public health response because of the delay in accurate diagnosis (NASEM, 2017a). Even as the CDC and other organizations sought to improve su rveillance as the outbre ak was declared, the weak laboratory capacity was a major barrie r to continued case identification and implementation of proper public health measur es. Conversely, the importance of adequate laboratory capacity is illustrated by the African Center of Excelle nce for Genomics of Infectious Diseases in Nigeria, which was able to accurately diagnose the index case of the Nigerian Ebola outbreak and enable the government to contain th e spread before the outbreak became out of control (NASEM, 2017a). Additionally, the U.S. Department of De fense's Cooperative Biological Engagement Program (DoD-CBEP) deployed m obile laboratories in Sierra Leone and Guinea during the 2014 Ebola outbreak. In 2015 these laboratories analyzed more than 6,000 samples and quickly detected nearly 80 positive cases of Ebola in thes e 2 countries. As a step in capacity building, the Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States 7-14 GLOBAL HEALTH AND THE FUTURE ROLE OF THE UNITED STATES PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS laboratories increased diagnostic capabilities during the outbreak and are now being transitioned to the countries' governm ent to support future outbreak detection and response efforts (GHSA, 2017). Considering these differing examples, there is a clear motivation for the U.S. government to continue its engagement in laborator y capacity-building for outbreak response. Taken together - both workforce and laboratory capacity are essential to build a strong health system able to respond to infectious di sease outbreaks before they lead to catastrophic consequences, and in a cost-effective manner. According to Costello and Zumla (2000), by helping to create an independent researching body in LMICs, re searchers are trained in their home countries and are encouraged to stay th ere because of the exis ting infrastructure; in- country grants investigate the problems most of interest to th e nation's people; and results have a higher likelihood of leading to policy changes as compared to research conducted by individuals from other, high-income countries (Costello an d Zumla, 2000). Similarly, local mental health research conducted in LMICs is found to be much more easily adaptable to solve local problems as compared to research conducted by high-income countries that is based on evidence from high-income countries (Sharan et al., 2007). Pa st estimates have shown that implementing recommendations for increased research and de velopment capacity would cost $1 billion per year, which is much less than the potential cost of a pandemic (discussed more in Chapter 3) (Sands et al., 2016). The committee agrees with the statement made by the Committee on Clinical Trials During the 2014-2015 Ebola Outbreak, th at \"What seems certain to us is that the actual options are to pay now and prepare in adva nce, or to pay later when an outbreak occurs, with the likelihood that the cost will be multiple times greater in the latter case\" (NASEM, 2017a, p. 185). SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATION Underpinning health innovations is the necessa ry human and institutional capacity in the United States and globally. Yet the market for many global health products is often too uncertain or risky for private-sector part ners to invest their know-how a nd capital in the development and manufacture of these products (Pedrique et al., 2013). Cons idering the extremely costly development process, and the paucity of products in the pipeline to address neglected diseases, the current trial designs, re gulatory approval options, and pr oduct supply motivations seem inadequate (Pedrique et al., 2013). Examini ng each of these areas and the methods and mechanisms currently available can provide an op portunity for the U.S. government to find ways to reduce the costs and timeline to ensure more products make their way in to developm ent all the way to approval. Push and pull incentivizing m echanisms can also ensure that appropriate vaccines, therapeutics, diagnostics, and devices ar e in the development pipeline for global health priorities with weak markets, including neglec ted diseases (Dimitri, 2012). In the absence of these mechanisms, the United States and other gove rnments risk spending far more as they work to prevent, respond to, and treat di seases using suboptimal tools. To complement developing safe and efficaci ous products requires R&D capacity in countries where outbreaks begin and disease burdens are high (NASEM, 2017a). Although there are some notable exceptions, the necessary rese arch capacity is weak in many such countries, making it difficult to conduct clinical and field trials, becoming even more of a costly and chaotic undertaking during a pub lic health emergency (NASEM, 2017a). By examining the stages along the pharmaceutical development value chain, the U.S. government has an opportunity to identify specific actio ns that can be taken to stre amline processes, reduce costs, Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States CATALYZING INNOVATION 7-15 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS and create more appropriate incen tives to enable industry, academia , and others to contribute to developing the priority innovations for global he alth. This could be accomplished through an interagency working group, but would require dedi cated commitment from all involved agencies, as well as coordination across th e public and pr ivate sectors. Conclusion: Despite substantial effo rts from the U.S. government and other global health players, the pipeline of innovations for addressing persistent global health threats is inadequate. The U.S. government has the ability to design and expand push and pull mechanisms that c an catalyze industry, academia, and others to develop, license, and introdu ce needed technologies and avoid the catastrophic loss of life a nd economic burdens that result from the lack of these innovations. Conclusion: Creating the capacity for low- and middle-income countries to conduct clinical trials wher e the burden of disease is highest, using their own workforces and facilities, is both more efficient and more cost-effective than relying on donor nations for these efforts. Creating this capacity will require investing in laboratory capacity, and an appropriately trained research- competent workforce. Recommendation 10: Accelerate the Development of Medical Products U.S. government agencies should invest in a targeted effort to reduce the costs and risks of developing, li censing, and introducing vaccines, therapeutics, diagnostics, and devices needed to address global health priorities by enabling innovative tr ial design approaches, streamlining regulation, ensuring production capaci ty, creating market incentives, and building international capacity for res earch and development. This effort should include the following: Enabling innovative approaches for trial design: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), th e U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) should actively encourage public- and private-sector product development efforts using innovative product development approaches, including platform studies,adaptive trial designs, pragmatic trials, and improved biomarkerdevelopment. BARDA should assess expa nding its list of priority products for codevelopment with industry, ta king into account global health priorities. Streamlining regulation: FDA should receive adequate resources to improve the tropical disease priority review voucher program and should assess the application of the provisions outlined in the GeneratingAntibiotic Incentives NowAct to neglect ed tropical diseases beyond those on the qualified pathogen list. Ensuring production capacity: BARDA should increase its efforts to promote adequate global manufacturi ng capacity for priority technologiesCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Creating market incen tives: The U.S. government should invest in generating and disseminating accurate and transparent market estimates and should use the purchasing power of U.S. government agencies andglobal partnerships such as Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, as well as such creative financing mechanisms as volume guaran tees, to reduce market uncertainty for priority health products. Building international capacity for research and development: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, NIH, and DoD should increase the number of people and institutions in partner countries capableof conducting clinical tr ials for global health priorities (e.g., through funding partnerships with academic institutions). This effort shouldencompass providing support for sustaina ble core capacities such as drug, vaccine, and diagnostic research cap abilities and buildi ng the skills of principal investigators. ENABLING INNOVATION : DIGITAL HEALTH Telecommunications and wireless multimedia have contributed to significant advances in global health in recent years. By taking advantage of wireless network penetration in LMICs, digital health technology has bypassed defici encies found in traditional \"brick-and-mortar\" health care systems and provides a myriad of solutions ranging from education for new and expectant mothers through MAMA 23 (MAMA, 2013) to reminders for adherence to chronic disease management (Hamine et al., 2015). Although there have been many successful applications of digital health tools around the world, they ha ve typically employed a short- sighted approach and a narrow perspective (M ehl and Labrique, 2014). While this was likely done to create a simpler process for faster and eas ier results, the current models fail to prevent unnecessary duplication and addre ss broader health system need s. Finally, both U.S. global health programs and countries around the world have seen much progress in improved health outcomes stemming from technological advances and digital health tools. Although they will continue to face up-front costs of establishing the digital infrastr ucture and training a workforce to utilize the digital platforms, the long-term co mmitment to their use has the potential to reduce costs and improve efficiency of health care programs (MoH, n.d.; WHO, 2009). The committee believes that now is a time to pause, review all of the progress made and lessons learned, and chart a strategic path forward in digital gl obal health, with an emphasis on systematic approaches, multidisciplinary public-private collaboration, and country ownership. Applications of Digital Global Health 23 The Mobile Alliance for Maternal Action (MAMA) was la unched in 2011 as a public-private partnership between USAID, Johnson & Johnson, the UN Foundation, and BabyCenter with the goal of catalyzing a global community to deliver vital health information to new and expectant mothers and their families through mobile phones. BabyCenter created a core set of messages for MAMA that are timed and targeted to pregnant women and infants through 3 years old. Over just 5 years the program reached more than 7.5 million women and families (MAMA, 2013). Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States CATALYZING INNOVATION 7-17 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Many U.S. government agencies and their im plementing partners, as well as private companies and other national governments, have em ployed digital health technology to facilitate elements of global health, whether for dise ase surveillance, patie nt tracking, inventory maintenance, or telemedicine. Though the a pplications of digital health technology are expansive, the committee has categorized them into three broad applicati on areas for discussion: data systems creation, health care service optimi zation, and research effici ency, explored below, with examples of each highlighted in Box 7-2. Data Systems A hallmark of digital health utilization has b een its support of data systems in developing countries. Health information in developing countries has long been captured on paper, which must then be physically transported, and the data manually aggregated and reentered, then extracted for review by high-le vel officials (Mehl and Labriq ue, 2014). This includes routine health facility data and acute event data, such as disease outbreaks. Understandably, delays and errors are commonplace\u2014creating inefficiencies in a health system. Digital health tools have revolutionized this process, allowing for data collection, reporting, and action to occur much more rapidly, and with fewer opportunities to introduce error (RTI, n.d.). Box 7-2 illustrates an example of data systems improvement in LMICs through Coconut Surveillance. BOX 7-2 Applications of Digital Global Health Tools Data Systems: Coconut Surveillance Coconut Surveillance is an open-source, mobile-based tool used for malaria control and elimination currently being used in Zanzibar. Community health workers use tablets to collect data as they conduct case detection. The information is then dispatched to health officials at the Zanzibar Malaria Elimination Program. Data collected are synchronized with a cloud database (accessible on the web) in near real-time, allowing for rapid analysis and decision making for targeting program resources. Health Care Service Optimization: Operation ASHA Operation ASHA is an India-based nongovernmental organization that seeks to improve tuberculosis (TB) treatment. Operation ASHA, in collaboration with Microsoft, created a software called eCompliance that seeks to reduce lapses in TB treatment (thereby preventing the development of multidrug resistant [MDR]-TB). eCompliance registers patients and staff through fingerprints and sends text message updates of patient compliance to counselors and program managers. If a dose is missed, the program sends an alert to the patient, health worker, and supervisor. eCompliance also empowers healthcare providers to provide counseling to patients who lapse in treatment so the spread of MDR-TB is reduced. The program has been rolled out for nearly 9,000 TB patients thus far in Cambodia, the Dominican Republic, India, Kenya, and Uganda and has already recorded more than 400,000 transactions with very positive results. Many health and medical challenges encounter loss of patient follow-up as a barrier to success\u2014regardless of the country or income level. The model of eCompliance has the potential to be expanded beyond TB, to areas such as consistent antenatal care, childhood vaccination documentation, or prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission. Research Efficiency: Clinical Ink Clinical Ink is a technology company that offers a mobile solution to streamline clinical trials, Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States 7-18 GLOBAL HEALTH AND THE FUTURE ROLE OF THE UNITED STATES PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS called SureSource, which is currently the only platform that meets all FDA guidelines for electronic source data. SureSource can capture information from onsite electronic medical records and from data collected at the time of the patient/provider interaction, making data collection easier and efficient. Furthermore, SureSource allows clinical researchers to directly engage with patients through a mobile app. They can also use their own mobile devices, a practice which is typically not standard protocol for many studies, but contributes to improved user participation due to their familiarity with their own device. This enables researchers to monitor patients remotely and encourages patients to self-report data. SOURCES: Clinical Ink, 2015; Operation ASHA, 2016; RTI, n.d.; Seguine, 2016; USAID, 2013. Health Care Service Optimization Access to qu ality health care in LMICs is often hindered by workforce shortages and poor infrastructure (MoH, n.d.). Though long-term, co mplete solutions to both of these issues requires the scale-up of human re sources and creation of adequate amounts and types of clinics, digital health tools have been able to provide effective inte rim solutions. The most well-known form of digital health used to optimize service delivery is telemedicine , an effective means of providing access to more specialized care to remote regions (or those lacking high-skilled health care workers) in a cost-effective manner (G reen, 2016; WHO, 2009). Other widely utilized modalities of digital health in this area include SMS reminders and mobile protocols (Hamine et al., 2015; MAMA, 2013).24 As a result, while the longer-term goal of increasing the number of high-level medical providers will still require lengthy timelines, patients can access high-level care now, through leveraging these technology tools. Box 7-2 illustrates an example of this type of innovation through Operation ASHA. Research Efficiency Biomedical research and clinical trials\u2014esp ecially for infectious diseases endemic to certain areas in LMICs, such as Lassa Fever, E bola, or Zika virus, depend on robust and capable sites in these same regions. Recr uitment for trials is an arduous process as they require a large group of patients to comprise the study sample (Zimmer et al., 2010). Leaning on technology, databases of patients with partic ular diseases, or dis ease registries, have been positioned as a critical prelude to clinical trials and can help improve recruitment, identity patient cohorts, provide data for natural history studies, and stimulate new res earch (Groft, 2014). Furthermore, using digital health tools can al so facilitate in-country trials . Typically, patients need to continuously return to a clinical tr ial site for periodic data collec tion, but this can be a barrier in remote or resource-poor areas where travel is le ngthy and expensive. Having remote options for check-in and periodic follow-up can remove this barrier (Seguine, 2016). Additionally, having a disease registry in a city or c ountry can allow for faster start- up for other studies on different diseases, making that area more attractive to rese archers. See Box 7-2 for an example of a digital health solution for clinical trials. A Need for a Paradigm Shift 24 Mobile Protocols: These tools enable health care provider s to efficiently deliver health solutions, such as daily nutritional supplement reminders or dosage reminders. Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States CATALYZING INNOVATION 7-19 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS The tremendous value and corresponding excite ment that digital health provides has come at a cost, as the prolifer ation of interest and the variet y of stakeholders involved has created a fragmented approach to the use of digital tools for health in many countries. In fact, in 2012, Uganda issued a temporary moratorium on digi tal health pilots because its health system became overrun with them (Green, 2016). Aid pr ograms, nongovernmental organizations, and private companies often create individual, disease- focused tools that fail to be interoperable with one another and are duplicative to in-country systems. Therefore, despite the large investment in digital health applications, these parallel structures often lead to inefficiencies because they cannot be used for other diseases or health pr iorities. Multiple donors a nd organizations may be funding and operating multiple surveillance systems for different diseases in the same country, instead of aligning themselves into one interope rable system, integrated with existing national health system infrastructure. The benefit of digital health applica tions notwithstanding, there is a clear need for a paradigm shift in digital health infrastructure investments. The global health community and U.S. global health programs need to move away from the current practice of single application solutions to a more strategic approach that act s holistically with both current country priorities and long term goals (Mehl and Labrique, 2014) . By better coordinating the development of digital health a pplications, stakeholders involve d in digital health can reduce duplication and ensure that the platforms are more aligned with those priorities and goals. The committee envisions not only digital tool s for real-time collection of health and health-related data from anywhere in the world, but also connected systems that ensure the data can be aggregated and shared (when appropriate), instantly analyzed and intuitively visualized so that health professionals and policy decision make rs at all levels\u2014commu nity, district, country and global\u2014can take action. The committee sees this occurring through the development of digital health platforms within countries. The hallma rk of a digital health platform is that it must be adaptable to local health needs. However, it is neither efficient nor practical for each program or country to invest in devel oping a full suite of needed tools to support their health system. Therefore, a core characteristic of a common digital health platform would be that of an open innovation platform that holds and facilitates acce ss to health care and he alth-related data for a multitude of applications. By building a digital health platform that is modular, countries can attract and engage third parties (i ncluding the private sector) to de velop useful applications that can be customized to their unique context and then integrated sustainably. While such a platform would be useful for day-to-day health care de livery and operations, it would also revolutionize how surveillance and response for public health threats can be managed within and between countries. The committee sees a digital health platform revolutionizing the three broad areas of digital health: data systems, health care serv ice optimization, and rese arch efficiency, as described in the following sections. Data Systems Though some systems can collect data in remote areas and others offer near-real-time data streams, they do not interact with each other a nd the data cannot be easily aggregated. This severely limits the potential of using such data to optimize h ealth care service delivery or surveillance of potential emerging global health threats. The committee therefore advocates for a common digital health platform architecture that can create interoperabi lity across existing or future data systems, but would not require each user to adopt a prescrib ed solution. Instead, data could be collected across disparate sites and sy stem s and aggregated for everyday healthcare needs, including delivery of services, payments for services, and global health threats. The Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States 7-20 GLOBAL HEALTH AND THE FUTURE ROLE OF THE UNITED STATES PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS digital financial sector has alrea dy made key advances in this area in LMICs, as evidenced by the success of m-Pesa25 or other electronic payment systems. Th e digital health sect or can learn from these innovations as related to the interoperabi lity and privacy of such systems and avoid developing them from scratch. Health Care Service Optimization Though digital health tools have provided numerous solutions in terms of augmenting health care workforces, a digita l health platform can maximize this capacity. Enhanced access to data and information through a common digital platform will improve communication between patients and healthcare workers across the care continuum, as well as in crease the productivity and quality of the workforce. While this does no t replace the longer-term need to educate and train a larger workforce, these technology capab ilities can address the short-term needs and expand the scope of a health workforce to match the demand for more integrated health services. Research Efficiency The digitalization of clinical trials and ge neral global health research can reduce the waste of duplicative technology in global health and allow for str eamlined and remote collection of data, thereby resulting in potential cost savings. A digital h ealth platform can improve on the efficiencies already gained thr ough facilitation of data-sharing among investigators, potentially allowing for novel research inquiry. For example, if two similar clinical trials are occurring simultaneously, a digital health platform could enable controlled sharing of data (within the scope of research ethics) to investigate anot her separate study question. Additionally, a common platform would likely allow for mo re targeted studies and faster recruitment, as country disease trends and relevant health information would be aggregated from multiple data streams to highlight burdens and gaps in existing care and tools. Looking Forward: A Role for the U.S. Government in the World of Digital Global Health As many partners around the globe, both publ ic and private, have been supportive and involved with the creation of di gital health tools, a need em erged for standardization and coordination as well as assistance to move from policy to implem entation. To help bring clarity and coherence to governments on digital techno logy investment for health, a Global Digital Health Index is under development by WHO and partner organizations as a tool to track, monitor, and evaluate the applicability of any digital technology solutio n for a community's or country's health (Mechael and Kay, 2016), as highlighted in Box 7-3. BOX 7-3 Global Digital Health Index The Global Digital Health Index will provide data on the update and use of information and communications technology across countries, providing valuable information for trend analysis 25 m-Pesa is a mobile money transferri ng system in Kenya that operates thro ugh users' cell phon es. Safaricom, the cellular telecommunications company that started m-Pesa, generates $250,000,000 per year in revenues from m- Pesa alone (CBS News, 2015).

The Index will guide governments to develop national framew orks to monitor the effects of digita l health investments and guide where investments are neede d. act as a global clearinghouse on best practices in digital health. Identify and promote ways that the public and private sector can engage with each other. benefit people around the world by enabling the better creation and use of digital health techno logy. SOURCE: HealthEnabled, n.d.-b. In addition to a global index, there is also increasing rec ognition of the importance of fra meworks to help prioritize investments in digital health technology and identify opportunities for collaboration and integration with local h ealth systems (Mehl and Labrique, 2014). Many national governments have starte d to adopt national e-Health strategies, including Ghana (MoH, n.d.), Nigeria (MoH, 2015), and Tanzania (M oHSW, 2013). The common aspects of these frameworks include: an efficient use of res ources, improved data and information flow, and reduced fragmentation (HealthEnabled, n.d.-a). D onors often lack methods for the coordination and alignment of funding of digital health investments, which has resulted in fragmentation and an inability to scale. The national e-Health stra tegies that are emerging signal a shift in thinking and open the door for better aid coordi nation driven by country priorities. As the global community moves toward a more harmonized approach to digital technology application, the United States has an oppor tunity to re-assess its current strategy and direct resources and expertise to ward the growing momentum for global alignment in this space. The United States can likely see greater returns on investment th rough coordinating U.S. digital health investments with the needs of the count ry, and where possible a ssisting countries to develop their e-Health strategies. Furthermore, this alignment in partnership could incentivize local government toward co-investment, thus fac ilitating better transiti on to country ownership and sustainability. In 2015, 25 percent of Africa and 58 percent of Asia ha d an internet connection (Poushter, 2016), with this number expected to continue increasing. Additionally, many innovations and services have been created even without internet acce ss, such as through the massive proliferation of cellular networks usi ng simple mobile phones (e.g., m-Pesa, described previously). To facilitate further growth in c onnectivity, the United States recently passed, with bipartisan support, H.R. 660, the Digital Global A ccess Policy Act. This bill encourages efforts in developing countries to improve internet acc ess to spur economic growth and improve health, in addition to ensuring effective use of U.S. foreign assistance.26 The act specifically calls for USAID to integrate efforts to expand internet access into education, development, and economic growth programs, as well as use of informati on and communications technologies for disaster relief. To do so, the Act calls for the use of th e build-once principle, which hopes to lower the cost of infrastructure development by minimizi ng the number and scale of excavation activities 26 Digital GAP Act of 2017, H.R. 600, 115th Congress.

The comm ittee sees a strong opportunity for the United States to build on this goal and rethink its global health strategies to join the global momentum towards harmonization to fully integrate digital health approaches. SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATION Decreases in the costs and increased demand of mobile t echnology have allowed for the integration of successful digital health efforts in the United States a nd around the globe (Mehl and Labrique, 2014; Steinhubl et al ., 2013). However, many of these investments in global health have been siloed and short-sighted in their appr oach, often focusing on sing le diseases or sectors and missing opportunities to develop a sustainable, integrated platform (Mehl and Labrique, 2014). Prioritizing health syst ems innovation through technical assistance and public-private partnerships in digital health can lead to better care and service delivery at lower cost, especially in situations in which already established t echnology is utilized (M ehl and Labrique, 2014; WHO, 2009). With growing mobile and internet connectivity worldwide and rapid advances in information and communication technology, the Un ited States has an op portunity to better integrate digital health efforts in countries to reduce fragmentation and improve coordination and efficiency (Mehl and Labrique, 2014; Poushter, 2016). Conclusion: Countries need cross-cutting digital health platforms that are adaptable to local requirements and soverei gnty, and can provide real-time data and analytic insights to inform health-relat ed decisions. Such platforms need to address each country's health care prio rities during steady-state times, thereby incentivizing country co-investment a nd ownership, while also serving as a resilient system for facili tating controlled sharing of data across countries to enhance surveillance, coordinate respons es, and deliver services during an emergency. Conclusion: Achieving the global health goal s outlined in this report will require that U.S. global health programs leverage the expertise and resources of the U.S. government in digital he alth and the strong U.S. in formation and communication technology industry through public-priva te partnerships and smart financing strategies (see Chapter 8). Recommendation 11: Improve Digi tal Health Infrastructure Relevant agencies of the U.S. governme nt should convene an international group of public and private stakeholders to create a common digital health framework that addresses country-level needs ranging from integrated care to research and development. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and the U.S. Department of State should incentivize and support countries in building interoperable digital health platforms that can efficiently collect and use health data and analytic insights to enable the delivery of integrated services within a country.

U.S. agencies should expand upon the \"build-once\" principle of theDigital Global Access Policy Act and align U.S. funding in digital health by multiple agencies to reduce fragme ntation and duplication, as well as maximize the effectiveness of investme nts. The provision of this funding should employ methods that reflect smar t financing strategies to leverage private industry and country cofi nancing (see Recommendation 13).

Investments need to reflect a globalized world in which the commercial sector , nonprofit and faith-based organizations, and recipient governments all have a partnership role to play. Without this global collaboration and appropriately structured financi ng mechanisms, further global health progress will be difficult to realize. This chapter discusses several approaches for global h ealth investment, including such broad and cross-cutting goals as global public goods, health syst em strengthening, and long-term visioning. Also explored are several creative and nontraditional mechanisms of financing for global health programs and projects that have emerged in recent ye ars. Finally, with the previous areas as context, this chapter concludes with priorities for U.S. global health investment approaches and mechanisms. KEY APPROACHES FOR GLOBAL HEALTH INVESTMENT In addition to the specific areas of focus out lined in the early sect ions of this report: global health security; continuous communicable diseases; saving and improving the lives of women and children; and the prom otion of cardiovascular health and prevention of cancer, there are clear benefits to investi ng in global public goods, health systems strengthening, and long- term programs that lead to lasting change. Altho ugh the majority of global health investments are typically in single, vertical di sease programs, these cross-cutting areas can produce large returns and long-term benefits. Future allocations of fo reign assistance for health by the United States should consider investments focu sed on the greatest return, and also those that require strong leadership and commitment where the United Stat es could play a role, such as the examples described below. Contributing to Global Public Good As countries transition out of bilateral ai d, donor governments have an opportunity to think more strategically about investing in global public goods instead of direct country assistance (also discussed in Chapter 2). Globa l public goods are those that require too many resources for one country to create alone, such as research and development advancements in medical products or digital health technologies that can be shared with other entities. There is no \"global government\" to address these challenges and ensure provision of needed services or products (WHO, 2017), and there is little market incentive to motiv ate private sector investment. Unfortunately, the benefits are not always im mediately apparent and convincing government leaders to dedicate money to th ese collaborative goals can be challenging. Furthermore, it is demanding to report and measure concrete progr ess of the funds and programs dedicated to global public goods, which makes it difficult to di rectly attribute success to individual Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States 8-2 GLOBAL HEALTH AND THE FUTURE ROLE OF THE UNITED STATES PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS investments (Birdsall and Diofasi, 2015). Howe ver, returns on investment for global public goods are positive and sustainable. For example, the rotavirus vaccine, developed jointly by India and the United States, has si gnificantly reduced the disease burden of rotavirus in India, translating to improved health and incr eased economic benefits (see Box 8-1). BOX 8-1 Case Study: 116E Rotavirus Vaccine Low- and countries (LMICs) face a significant burden of rotavirus gastroenteritis in the under-5 population. Prior to the global roll-out of rotavirus vaccines, this illness was responsible for 450,000 under-5 deaths each year, more than 95 percent of which occurred in Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance (Gavi)-eligible countries. In India alone, about 113,000 children under 5 die of rotavirus every year, and Indians spend between $37.4 million and $66.8 million on direct medical costs for diarrhea hospitalizations and outpatient treatments. Acknowledging this glaring problem, the United States and India launched a bilateral vaccine action program and developed India's first indigenous rotavirus vaccine. Economic research in this area suggests that introducing the rotavirus vaccine with the already-established vaccine regimens avoids 34.7 deaths and $215,569 out-of-pocket expenses per 100,000 children under-5. Increasing vaccine coverage to 90 percent in India, including against rotavirus, prevents an additional 22.1 deaths and $45,914 out-of-pocket expenditures per 100,000 children under 5. SOURCES: Bennett et al., 2016; Megiddo et al., 2014; NIAID, 2015; Tate et al., 2012. As stated above, measurement of global effort s has been difficult, but is not impossible, and new tools are emerging. The Organizati on for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) recently proposed a new measure, called the total official support for sustainable development (TOSSD), which aims to capture donor spending on global public goods and can facilitate learning exchange, track progress on gl obal challenges, and inform policy discussions using empirical evidence (DAC, 2016). With international collaboration among donors, providers, civil society, multilateral organizations , and the private sector, OECD hopes to drive the operationalization of this measurement framew ork to have TOSSD enable the international community to monitor resources supporting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) beyond overseas development aid (DAC, 2016). This could also be applied to many global public good efforts involving multiple countries. Health Systems Strengthening U.S. global health programs have often been designed and funded with a singular, vertical disease focus, such as the President' s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and the President's Malaria In itiative (PMI). Though they have conc rete and specific targets and have a positive impact, they do not sufficiently enable ma ny of the cross-cutting elements necessary to build resilient and robust health systems. To address this in part, previous chapters in this report call for broadening workforce training and task -shifting for community health workers into established platforms like PEPFAR clinics and integrating services in maternal and child health Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States SMART FINANCING STRATEGIES 8-3 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS services centers to better in corporate awareness and manageme nt of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). As evidenced during the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, weak health systems and capabilities\u2014including disease detection or resp onse\u2014contributed to the increased severity of the outbreak in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone (GHRF Commission, 2016). Building resilient health systems allows countries to better res pond to global health security threats while simultaneously providing the necessary elements and workforce skills to effectively deliver everyday services such as surveillance, an tenatal, well-child, a nd hypertension services. However, similar to resource mobilization for gl obal public goods, there are often barriers to funding health system strengt hening activities (i.e., financ ing design, workforce capacity building, and infrastructure buildin g) without clear pathways for a ttribution or immediate results. Yet, as evidenced in Nigeria during the 2014 Ebola outbreak (see Chapter 3), developing fundamental capabilities can also contain emer ging outbreaks and indir ectly provide lasting benefits to surrounding populations. Long-Term Investment for Long Lasting Change In global health, programs that promise straig htforward service delivery or quick results are often able to take preced ence over long-term investments that take a much greater time period to demonstrate return on investments (IOM, 2014). For many health and development programs, change is gradual, and social and eco nomic benefits often lag behind the costs and can even occur decades after an ini tial investment (Stenberg et al., 2014). For countries with scarce resources, it is challenging to make the case fo r investment in projects or programs that have long-term benefits. For example, bu ilding a hospital in a district to prevent the need to travel for health care is an important but costly venture. While it may take 1 year or more to build, the benefits of reducing premature mortality and the resulting demographic dividend may not be realized for decades. Conversely, if that same di strict has a high burden of malaria, it would be more politically feasible to spend money on quick ly procuring mosquito nets with proven effects in malaria prevention\u2014a less costly investment with more short- term, concrete benefits. As a result, best value investments may be ignored as success takes too long to be observed. By working with other countries to look at the long-term investments, the United States has an opportunity to design effort s that will not only build capaci ty but also complement global public goods spending. The eradicati on of smallpox serves as an important success story from this type of investment (see Box 8-2). Though not endemic in many high-income countries in the 1960s, there was still a constant need to vacc inate citizens\u2014including those in high-income countries such as the United States\u2014which was a costly endeavor. The global decision to eradicate smallpox resulted in thes e costs being avoided, and return s on that moderate investment are still realized each year by the United States and the world (Barrett, 2013; Brilliant, 1985). Similarly, even though only a handful of polio cases are diagnosed each year, continued investment toward polio eradi cation will be imperative, especi ally when conflict zones and fragile states continue to enable environments fo r polio to survive (discussed in Chapter 3). The investment in the Global Polio Eradication Initia tive in 1988 has already generated net returns of $27 billion, and is projected to reach $40-$50 billion by 2035 (Duintjer Tebbens et al., 2010; GPEI, 2014). Continued support to ac hieve polio eradicati on could have as much, if not greater, long-term returns on investment as those realized for smallpox eradication.

Using a strategy of surveillance and containment, the WHO was able to eradicate (a term used to signify a to tal absence of human cases) smallpox by 1977. This was a landmark achievement in public health and signified the first time a disease was successfully fought on a global scale. Estimates place the expenditures of the campaign at roughly $200 million for endemic countries and $98 million for non endemic countries through international aid. The cost of smallpox in endemic countries (i ncluding cost of care and loss of economic productivity) was estimated to be at least $1 billio n per year at the start of the campaign. While industrialized countries were no endemic at the start of the eradication effort, they still needed to maintain population-wide immunity to protect against the possibility of imported cases. The annual cost (both direct and indirect) in these countries was approximately $350 million. This places the global costs of smallpox in the 1960s at $1.35 billion per year. Though these costs could be avoided through eradication, the long-term benefits were difficult to convey to endemic countries due to other short-term needs taking precedence. But, once eradication was achieved, the benefits of avoided infections outweighed the costs at a rate of 119:1 in low-income endemic countries, and as high as 178:1 in industrialized non- endemic countries, resulting in 159:1 globally. The United States, as the largest contributor to the campaign, saves the one-time expenditures it invested every 26 days that the world is free from smallpox, making smallpox eradication one of the best public health investments in history. SOURCES: Barrett, 2013; Brilliant, 1985; Fenner et al., 1988; Miller et al., 2006; Seymour, 2004; WHO, 2010. Finding: Global public goods, health sy stems strengthening, and long-term investments in global health are three approaches that prove difficult to procure funds for, due to the cha llenges associated with attr ibution and the lack of immediate and clear benefits. Yet, wh en structured well, these types of investments can have robust and sustainable returns. CHANGES TO GLOBAL HEALTH FINANCING METHODS As reviewed in Chapter 2, the growing econom ies of several low-income countries will propel them toward middle-income status in coming years, which will allow for increased recruitment of domestic sources of financing to support their health progr ams. The United States can advise these growing economies on best practic es for crafting stable tax bases, developing innovative tax initiatives, and restructuring debt ratios as they build up health systems. Through this technical assistance, the United States has a chance to begin to reduce its spending on development assistance for health (DAH). Acco rding to a 2016 development cooperation report from Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the United States already has begun to reexamine development assi stance in order to more effectively achieve sustainable and transformational global health outcomes in light of the financing transitions Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States SMART FINANCING STRATEGIES 8-5 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS occurring in global health. The United States ha s mobilized funds by increasing private capital flow, incorporating more private sector and nongovernmental organization (NGO) partners, and investing in more science, t echnology, and innovati on (OECD, 2016). As an example, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) strengthened its Development Credit Authority (DCA) to unlock larger sources of capital. Furthermore, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation found that the United States was able to mobilize $10 billion from the private sector through guarantees in 2012-2014 to facilitate pa rticipation in the development of LMICs (OECD, 2016). To help achieve the SDGs by 2030, as well as maintain its role as a global health leader and home to numerous multinational businesses, the committee believes that the United States is positioned to tackle global health in a more nimble and flexible way by unlocking additional capital and exploring alternative market strategies. This can be done through assisting countries in their transitions to domestic financin g, exploring catalytic financing with the private sector, and creating value in financ ial structure\u2014all discussed below. Transitioning to Domestic Financing Government health expenditure as a source (GHE-S) 1 in low-income countries rose 8.5 percent annually from 2000 to 2013 (IHME, 2016). Moreover, middle-income countries' use of GHE-S actually exceeded external DAH nearly 80 times in 2013 (IHME, 2016), indicating potential for targeted transition fo r those countries that are ready for more sustainable sources of funding through domestic resource mobilization (DRM). It will be important to understand that while DRM is playing a larger role globally, this transition will vary base d on individual country status. Low-income countries will still need continued DAH from donors to support their health programs, and approaches for middle-income c ountries will demand a fo cus on sustainability. Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance (Gavi) is well known for its long-term strategy of phasing its partner countries out of support through co-financing. First implemented in 2008, Gavi's policy designates the size of the domestic contribution based on the country's ability to pay and has been found to contribute to country ownership an d sustainability (Gavi, 2014). Thus far, 2015 has been their most successful year for co-fin ancing, with countries increasing their spending on vaccines per child by 47 percent in just 1 year (2013-2014) (Gavi, 2015). This policy was also included in Gavi's 2016-2020 strategy, which recognizes the need to in tegrate sustainability into country engagement at the beginning of the relationship (Gavi, 2015). Recognizing this trend, many donors are hoping to help recipient governments transition health programs to domestic sources of financing. Tax revenues are often the main sources of funds that governments have to finance their hea lth systems, and in LMICs tax revenues make up approximately 65 percent of tota l revenues (IMF, 2011). However, the majority of revenue in LMICs often comes from consumption taxes, which may not create a stable tax base (Reeves et al., 2015). LMICs need a more balanced appro ach to revenue mobilization, which includes corporate and capital gains taxes. Imposing higher corporate taxes can have important benefits to health, and in countries with particularly low tax revenues (< $1,000 per capita per year), the benefits are substantial (Reeves et al., 2015) . Although LMICs have the most to gain from corporate taxes, many countries do not receive ad equate revenues from them because they offer low rates to attract businesses (B irn et al., 2017). This trend fre quently occurs with the natural and extractive resources industr ies, robbing governments of much-needed revenue (DanWatch, 2011) and needs to be consider ed during these transitions. 1 GHE-S is defined as expenditures on health from domestic government sources (IHME, 2016).

There are smaller-scale innovations such as development impact bonds, or models like the Development Innovation Ventur es through USAID's Global De velopment Lab (GDL). The private sector has also become an active global he alth player in the past decade, shifting their interests from \"corporate social responsibility\" line items to becoming sustainable partners because they see a true return on investment for their business. While it is clear the U.S. government investment in global health should be sustained, the committee sees an opportunity for reshaping investments to be more targeted and catalytic, and leverage more of the existing funds from other sources and mechanisms. Severa l examples of potential methods are reviewed below. Small-Scale Innovations Development Innovation Ventures The GDL within USAID has contributed to nimble and responsive innovative efforts si nce its creation in 2012. The De velopment Innovation Ventures initiative was created to find, test, and scale up ideas that c ould radically improve global prosperity. It invests in ideas across three stages of growth: Stage 1 (Pro of of Concept), Stage 2 (Testing at Scale), and Stage 3 (Widespread Implementation) (USAID, 2017), with funding awards increasing as the proj ects grow. The Development Innovation Ventures model blends best practice strategies in a development appr oach that includes tiered risk management, economics research, and nonprofit and government development expertise. Hundreds of their projects across the world focus on health at various stages. Debt buy-downs Debt buy-downs, or conversions, have been used in many low-income countries to decrease country debt and free up resources to fund domestic health programs (Policy Cures, 2012). In a buy-down, a third-pa rty donor such as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation pays part of a loan on behalf of a country, allowing th at country to spend more of their money on the health program. This can also be tied to performance, where the donor will only pay off their portion of the loan if specific indicators are met (Policy Cures, 2012). One example of this conversion is a bilateral de bt swap called \"Debt2Health\" through the Global Fund to fight AIDS, TB, and Malaria (the Global Fund) that increases both resources for global health and local investment in health (UN Integrated Implementation Framework, n.d.). Similarly, debt swaps allow countries to exchange debt, typically at a discount, for equity or counterpart domestic currency f unds to finance a project (Kamel and Tooma, 2005). These can be structured to favor investments in priority s ectors, often using them as incentives to encourage privatization or facilitate the return of flight capital (Moye, 2001) . While these swapping mechanisms should not be a substitute for current foreign aid, they can be used as an additional tool for mobilizing domestic res ources (Kamel and Tooma, 2005) Social and development impact bonds Social impact bonds (SIBs) offer governments a smart way to deliver desired, measurable changes to their populations by leveraging multiple payers to achieve results. In a traditional model, service providers often cannot afford to make a large investment in a program, conduct a performance assessment, and then receive payment for the Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

First, because the success of these partnerships is contingent upon a specific and m easurable goal, sufficient historical data are required in order to create the goal (Shah and Costa, 2013). Second, SIBs and DIBs should not be used for essential services or for program s in which cessation would harm a population (Shah and Costa, 2013). Finally, the SIB process involv es many steps, and therefore the partnership requires a large investment of time and resour ces to ensure success (Shah and Costa, 2013). Given that understanding, if ex ecuted successfully, SIBs and DIBs can be very helpful to governments. Finding: Many small-scale innovations exist th at can be replicated and used more widely to create more oppor tunities in global health. Private Corporations and Investors The private sector has increasingly become a more active funding partner in global health projects in recent years. Their growing role will be critical in order to achieve many of the SDGs, in particular SDG 17, which calls for revitalizing global pa rtnerships for sustainable development. Because of the inherent desire of the private sector to constantly improve their bottom line, people in every country may have a difficult time trusting private companies to make decisions that will improve outcomes fo r people living in poverty. However, encouraging private companies to use their skills and res ources to both improve their markets and future business trajectories, while simultaneously cont ributing to social good, can be a sustainable strategy to improving global health outcomes. The private sector has a clear interest in preventing deaths and improvi ng living conditions for populations, both of which promote economic development, create new markets, a nd contribute to better operating conditions for businesses (Sturchio and Goel, 2012). A notable ex ample of private engagement in the global health space is the rise of pr oduct development partnerships, wh ich use public and philanthropic funds to incentivize research and development. These have become more common in recent years and have been able to provide much-needed drugs at an affordable level (Mahoney, 2011). With 82 percent of capital that reaches the devel oping world coming from the private sector, it is imperative to ensure that these funds, in addition to the private sector's expertise, bolster the development agenda effectively (Nathan, 2017). While private companies' philanthropic effort s have historically been categorized as corporate social responsibility, th e last decade has seen a shift to wards global health investment as a way to create shared value in their efforts. The shared value management strategy seeks to generate economic value while also addressi ng social problems (Porter and Kramer, 2011). Through linking social and business impact, co mpanies can then move towards greater innovation and value creation. Notable methods of shared value that companies can use include reconceiving products and market s, redefining productivity in th e value chain, and enabling local cluster development (Porter and Kramer, 2011) . Greater collaborati on among corporations, NGOs and governments for shared value will be important for further success (FSG, 2016), with a specific focus on leveraging the data collect ed by nonprofits and the public sector to bridge the gap between a shared value in tervention and detecting evidence of benefits - though benefits will take time to be realized. However, this term of shared value may be too narrow to encompass the many efforts by companies to seek and obtain sustainable commercial returns in LMICs while also providing health products an d needed services. For example, once generic Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States SMART FINANCING STRATEGIES 8-9 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS alternatives were approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2006, the PEPFAR program and the World Health Orga nization (WHO) began increasing demand for inexpensive but quality antiretrovi ral drugs, leading to a competitive market that transformed the prospects for a number of generic companies (Waning et al., 2010). Business models that are fit for purpose like many found in resource-constrained settings are more likely to be sustaina ble over the long run. Some compan ies have employed the \"triple bottom line\" strategy as a core element of their business to co nsider social, financial, and environmental factors when making important decisions. This focus on more comprehensive investment results has been growing across busin esses and nonprofit organizations, with an eye for improved sustainable growth (Slaper and Ha ll, 2011). To more clearly illustrate some of these concepts and how they can fit into globa l health, the United Nations Global Compact and KPMG produced a matrix that examines opportunities for the private sector for alignment of core competencies of their business with social good or engagement within each of the SDGs (KPMG and United Nations Global Compact, 2015). See Box 8-3 for various examples of private sector involvement in global health, including shared value, trip le bottom line approaches, and alignment of core competencies. BOX 8-3 Case Studies of Private Investment in Global Health NovoNordisk has taken a multi-faceted approach, fulfilling their triple bottom line mission by adopting a patient-centered focus in Indonesia in 2006, where general awareness and access to diabetes care was poor, but the burden was high. In 2013, 7.6 million people in Indonesia had diabetes, and another 12.6 million had prediabetes. To improve awareness and understanding of diabetes, NovoNordisk has contributed to community-based programs and increased clinical trials sponsorship. To increase access to care, NovoNordisk trained about 2,000 internists through their INSPIRE program and increased knowledge of diabetes screening and care by 11 percent. Expansion of the program to general practitioners, resulted in a 34 percent increase in knowledge among participants, and found significant HbA1c reductions in their patients after 12 weeks of insulin therapy (as compared to 17 percent among not specially-trained practitioners). All of NovoNordisk's programs have helped to create a valuable, long-term relationship with Indonesian stakeholders and people, along with the potential to supply a major portion of the insulin market over the next several years. Fina lly, employees at NovoNordisk reported a 21 percent increase in job satisfaction between 2008 and 2012, and employee turnover decreased by 7 percent during that same time frame. The Healthy Heart Africa program was launched by AstraZeneca in 2014 to increase access to medicines that prevent and treat ca rdiovascular disease by 10 million people by 2025. In Africa, cardiovascular disease is the third-leading killer in the region; the number of deaths to cardiovascular disease increased more than any other condition between 2000 and 2012. Healthy Heart Africa has integrated blood pressure screening and hypertension diagnosis and treatment into the PEPFAR platforms built for human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) and maternal and child health, has strengthened the supply chain to ensure access, and work at the community level to raise awareness of hypertension and the need for screening to drive demand. Working with local partners, and the Mission for Essential Drugs, AstraZeneca re-engineered their supply chain to ensure medicines are always availabl e to patients of their implementing partners, Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

In 2016, the Healthy Heart Africa program established new partnerships to continue to test approaches in Kenya and other countries in the region, specifically enhancing services for men ages 25-50 who typically access HIV/AIDS testing far less frequently than women. There will also be an independent impact evaluation of the program to provide further insight about how Healthy Heart Africa can be expanded and scaled up to other countries. In 2015, Sanofi joined the International Telecommunication Union's Be He@lthy, Be Mobile program, a mobile phone-based service to improve the prevention of and treatment and care for NCDs in eight priority countries. Through partnerships with WHO, public- private partnerships, national governments, and the United Nations, this program has initiated a SMS message program to provide advice and support for patients with diabetes to improve communications with their healthcare providers and the overall continuum of care Novartis sought to address the growing issue of access to health care\u2014focusing on rural India\u2014and in 2007 launched an initiative called Arogya Parivar . This offered a portfolio of affordable medicines designed to meet common regional issues and were sold in a manner that made them affordable to daily wage earners. Furthermore, Novartis partnered with microfinance organizations to improve access to capital for patients. Arogya Parivar now reaches 72 million people and has increased health seeking behavior. Furthermore, Arogya Parivar became profitable 31 months after its initiation and its sales have increased 25-fold since 2007.

Healthy wo rkforce overlap For multinational companies that depend on a workforce in LMICs, the motivation to become more involved in gl obal community health is even clearer. As mentioned in Chapter 4, the private sector has play ed a particularly important in role in malaria control and elimination, with th e much direct financing and in -kind donations being provided by the oil/gas and mineral industrie s. For example, the AngloGold Ashanti mining company faced a significant problem with malaria affecting its wo rkforce across multiple African countries with a 24 percent incidence rate. Worker absenteeism a nd low productivity came with serious costs to the company. In response, AngloGold Ashanti imple mented integrated malaria control programs in Ghana in 2005 that led to a 72 percent decreas e in disease burden in the first 2 years; the reduction in treatment costs saved the company around $600,000 per year by 2013 (FSG, 2017). At another mine in Tanzania, the AngloGold Ashanti developed a public-private partnership (PPP) with international development organizatio ns and the National Medical Research Institute of Tanzania to build on the program. The first phase focused only on employees and achieved a 50 percent reduction in malaria, but expansion to other mining ope rations were able to cover more than 90 percent of the mine's em ployees and 100,000 community members (AngloGold Ashanti, 2013). An example with a multi-country focus, th e Lubombo Spatial Development Initiative (LSDI) was a PPP formed in 2000 to address mala ria control in southern Africa including Mozambique, South Africa, and Swaziland (Moonasar et al., 2016) and improve the health and economic viability of the region.

All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States SMART FINANCING STRATEGIES 8-11 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS in South Africa and Mozambique and one of the founding partners of LSDI, had a keen interest as their workforce was continually threatened by malaria (WEF, 2006). Sin ce the majority of the new malaria cases in northeas tern South Africa and Swazilan d, both wealthier middle-income countries, were imported from neighboring Mo zambique, LSDI understood that to truly eliminate malaria there was a need to take a targeted approach at control measures in Mozambique. Following the implementation of control measures in Mozambique alone, Swaziland saw a 95 percent reduction in mala ria cases between 2000 and 2004 (Laxminarayan, 2016). U.S. public-private partnerships in research and development As discussed in Chapter 7, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Developm ent Authority (BARDA) appreciates that the pervasive challenges of medical countermeasure development and antimicrobial resistance require a global effort. They use PPPs to recruit skilled institutions and co mpanies of all sizes to solve this global problem of medical product development in an uncertain market. The Combating Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria Bioph armaceutical Accelerator, or CARB-X, was created in 2016 as the world's largest global antibacter ial public-private pa rtnership focused on preclinical discovery and early stage development of new an timicrobial products (HHS, 2016). CARB-X is a collaboration betw een National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, BARDA, and four life science a ccelerators, with each partner pl aying a unique role in their shared goal to set up a diverse portfolio with more than 20 high-quality antibacterial products\u2014dozens more than a single company would normally pursue. CARB-X plan s to accomplish their goals, and get more innovative products into clinical testing by leveraging $250 million from BARDA in the first 5 years, with matching funds from the Wellcome Trust and the AMR Centre. In addition to the CARB-X partnership, BA RDA is also pursui ng a pipeline of new antibiotics through a mechanism called the Other Transaction Authority (OTA), which allows BARDA and partners to diversif y their investment across a port folio of compounds. Traditional federal contracting often requires significant costs and time, but w ith more flexibility to change directions mid-course within th e portfolio, OTA offers time saving benefits as well. All strategic decision-making is done jointly with BARDA and the senior staff at the companies involved. The portfolio model enables the partnership to adjust plans according to the most promising candidates with the cost and risk shared between the partie s, something that was not possible through more traditional funding mechanisms (Houchens, 2015). The Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense recommended further use of this mechanism by BARDA, but has only found one instance of use since October 2015 (Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense, 2016). The committee supports expanded use of this type of flexible funding mechanism, also called for by the Senate Committee on Appropriations. 2 Pandemic Emergency Financing Facility Launched by the World Bank in May 2016 at th e G7 Ministers of Finance meeting, the Pandemic Emergency Financing Facility (PEF) is designed as a pandemic emergency response mechanism (World Bank, 2016). This mechanism is onl y to be used in emergency response; it is not a substitute for preparedness investments. The World Bank understands that quality, resilient health systems and strong public health capabili ties are crucial, but once an emergency event occurs, there is also a need to act quic kly. The PEF accelerates and improves emergency 2 U.S. Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill. Report 114-74. Senate. 2016.

It is financed through an insurance window, with funding pr ovided by resources from the reinsurance market combined with catastrophe bond proceeds, as well as a cash window, providing more flexible funding to address a larger set of emerging pathogens with uncertain consequences. Japan provided the first $50 million in funding commitment in 2016, and the World Bank expects the PEF to be active in 2017. Finding: The private sector has grown as an active global health stakeholder in recent years to go beyond simply involvement through corporate social responsibility to aligning their core business competencies with social good and improvement of health outcomes. As evidenced by the number of companies investing their own resources, the private sector can be leveraged as a sustainable partner for governments in th e future of global health. Value in Financial Structure The traditional aid model that provides a scheduled stream of funds does not produce the best incentives or results and is often too highly focused on short-term outcomes or inputs into their system instead of long-term outcomes or out puts. As part of the re-evaluation of the U.S. global health enterprise strategy to sustainably provi de aid and achieve the goa ls set in this report in a cost-effective manner, the U.S. govern ment could turn to successful multilateral organizations such as Gavi for new mechanisms . These organizations have successfully engaged in partnerships and market-shaping models to make their money go farther. For example, the Global Fund only finances programs when there is assurance that they do not replace or reduce other sources of health fundi ng, and it actively seeks opportuniti es to catalyze additional donor and recipient investment through grants and other supportive struct ures (Brenzel, 2012). Additionally, the World Bank and other developmen t banks have pursued better ways of putting money towards development, and tying results to financing, with much success. The committee identified front-loading investments and results-based financing as two alternative financing mechanisms than bring more value for money to U.S. global health spending. Front-Loading Investments Front-loading an investment allows more reso urces to be used initially while maintaining the level of investment over time. The theoretical benefit of this is that having a larger pool of resources upfront will enable a program to achie ve its goals faster (Barder and Yeh, 2006). For example, in the context of an advanced-purchas e agreement for vaccines, a front-loaded payment would increase the incentive for a manufacturer to bring products to market quickly (Berndt and Hurvitz, 2005) and provide a more efficient use of resources over time (Barder and Yeh, 2006). Gavi employs these types of various alternat ive financing models to avoid defaulting, and ensuring sustainability of servi ces provided in the countries invol ved in their partnership. As an example, their Advanced Market Commitment (AMC) generates incentives for vaccine manufacturers to produce affordable vaccines for the world's poorest countries. Following the launch of its pneumococcal conjugate pilot in 2007, accelerated immunization coverage against pneumococcal disease was documented across 53 Gavi countries, with 49 million children found Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States SMART FINANCING STRATEGIES 8-13 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS to be fully immunized (BCG, 2015). The AMC secu res lower prices for vaccines and increases access for the world's poorest children more quickly than before. Recommendations for future AMCs or other innovative financing mechanisms noted that successful engagement with the pharmaceutical industry is critical to improve sustainability of initiatives and enable manufacturers to shift from a corporate soci al responsibility-based approach to a more commercially viable strategy (BCG, 2015) as highlighted in the previ ous sections of this chapter. Through another front loading investment strategy called the International Finance Facility for Immunization (IFFIm), established in 2006, Gavi accelerates the availability and predictability of funds to support immunization programs by issuing bonds in the capital markets and converting long-term donor pledges into im mediate cash resources (Bilimoria, 2016). This type of mechanism, and others like it, was enc ouraged for replication by the Action Agenda at the Financing Conference for Development in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, in 2015 (UN, 2015). Through an independent evaluation in 2011, findings demonstrated that IFFIm was financially efficient, had achieved supranati onal status in capital markets, and was a robust and flexible model in challenging environments. Most importa ntly, it was credited wi th saving at least 2.75 million lives (Pearson et al., 2011). Results-Based Financing Results-based financing (RBF) programs for h ealth transfer money or goods\u2014either to patients when they take health-related actions or to healthcare providers when they achieve performance targets (Morgan, 2009). Currently, th e RBF model is being supported by the World Bank through the Health Resu lts Innovation Trust Fund, whic h was launched in 2007 with a special focus to achieve the women and child ren's health-related Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Following smaller-scale pilot gran ts, the RBF activities and relevant network have grown in both supply and demand. In fact, RBF programs around the world have demonstrated evidence-based transformational eff ects to maternal and child health. For example, the probability of in-hospital neona tal mortality of babies whose mothers enrolled in Plan Nacer, a RBF program, dropped by 74 percent in Argent ina; in Nigeria, the rate of modern contraceptive use in RBF areas was approximately twice that of non-RBF areas at 21.5 percent and 10 percent, respectively (World Bank Group, 2014) . The researchers were also able to show that the quality of care improved in thes e areas that implemented RBF practices. RBF programs can also improve in-country ha rmonization of comprehensive strategies for targeted sector services, such as maternal and child health. For example, the government of Rwanda directs its alignment efforts undernea th its RBF program, inviting donors to provide support for indicators that they have alrea dy designated (World Bank Group, 2014). This method of harmonization allows for reduced transaction costs and improved efficiency in reporting and verification for partners. Importantly, this method also provides a solution to the problem of poor alignment of donor goals and national priorities that has emer ged in recipient countries. Global Financing Facility Following this trend of increased progress and successful results through RBF, the World Bank Group and the governments of Canada, Norway, and the United States announced in September of 2014 the creation of the Global Financing Facility (GFF) to mobilize support for developing co untries' plans to accelerate progress on the MDGs and end preventable maternal and child deaths by 2017; GFF, 2016a). The GFF, the Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States 8-14 GLOBAL HEALTH AND THE FUTURE ROLE OF THE UNITED STATES PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS financing arm of Every Woman Every Child3, is a multi-stakeholder partnership that supports country-led efforts to improve the health of women, children and adolescents by focusing on a specific set of challenges\u2014includin g health financing and health systems. The main aim of the GFF is to close the $33 billion financing gap to m eet these challenges in 63 target countries, with the national governments leading the process through their own country platform of stakeholders (GFF, 2016b). Thus far, 16 \"front runner\" countries have begun piloting the GFF process (Claeson, 2017.4 The first step is the creation of an I nvestment Case, which establishes a unique set of evidenced-based interventions for a national government . Of the 16 countries that have initiated the GFF process, 7 have begun to implem ent their cases. To help countries successfully do so, GFF strives to move away from traditi onal development assistan ce, by using four smart financing pathways: improved efficiency, increased domestic resource mobilization, increasing and better aligning external financing, and le veraging private sector resources (Claeson, 2017). The first two pathways are especially useful given that 20 to 40 percent of health expenditures are lost due to inefficiency and that GFF modeling suggests th at the combination of economic growth, tax base increases, and in creased prioritization of health would close 71 percent of the $33 billion financing gap (Claeson, 2017). Though the majority of GFF's efforts are aimed at national governments, it also supports e fforts at the subnational level. Finding: Creating value in financial st ructure, through mechanisms like front- loading investments and results-based fi nancing can secure lower prices for commodities, save lives, and encourage sustainability of programs and health outcomes. PRIORITIES FOR U.S. GLOBAL HEALTH PROGRAMS Moving into the next decade of global health, it is clear that the as pirational global health goals set across many sectors will demand more than the previous DAH structures can offer. The questions then become, how can U.S. govern ment programs support growing economies of middle-income countries to take on more ownership of their health programs? How can all governments continue to attract investment and technical expertise from private companies as sustainable partners? What do th ese private companies need in order to feel comfortable investing their own resources? A nd finally, what can the United St ates do differently to make investments in global health more efficient and cost-effective? Supporting Domestic Resource Mobilization For countries with burgeoning economies and middle-classes, the economic case can be made to ministers of finance that investments in health infrastructure and personnel can be 3 Every Women Every Child is a global movement that puts into action the WHO's Global Strategy for Women's, Children's, and Adolescent's Health.

Investment in community health workers results in a return on investment as hi gh as 10:1 according to the WHO report Strengthening Primary Health Care through Community Health Workers (2015). The report also recommended that bilateral donors \"allow for and actively promote the use of disease-specific funding for integrated ... community health worker plans\" (Dahn et al., 2015, p. 25). As countries do shift to domestic financing, the United States can advise na tions in ways to structure their debt ratios and tax bases, and develop tax initia tives in order to create new reve nue streams or make better use of existing donor funds to streng then their health systems. Othe r types of support could include engagement with ministries on system design an d financing to assist in plan design, model refinement and expansion, return on investme nt analysis and financial plan execution . Further non-traditional support could include intellectual property and knowledge management such as case studies on financing pathways, documenti ng funding flows, and South-South capacity building functions (Qureshi, 2016). This advisory role is beginni ng to take shape, with the Sustainable Finance Initiative (SFI) for HIV/AIDS, an interagency partne rship among the Bureau for Economic Growth, Education and Environment at USAID, PEPFAR , and the U.S. Treasury, working through other countries' ministries of health and finance to help national governments examine methods of increasing their funding commitment to HIV/AI DS (USAID, 2016). Five countries already have representatives from the U.S. Treasury working in the USAID mission office to ensure this is done correctly and sustainably from the outset. As an example, SFI's impact in Kenya has contributed to an increase of $30-$40 million in new domestic spending being allocated to HIV response in each of the next five years. Finally, creating more fl exibility for innovative finance can better support this transition to domestic resource mobilization. As an example, USAID could allow development credit authority greater la titude to apply certain restrictions where the ultimate outcome will catalyze addi tional private sector resources and the capital markets. These restrictions could include limited ability to guara ntee sovereigns, or caps on total amount of risk guaranteed in a development credit au thority structure (Qureshi, 2016). Attracting Investment from Private Companies To continue to attract new m oney and maintain the interest of the private sector, U.S. programs need to increase thei r flexibility in developing i nnovative financing products and modalities. Examples could include working with the finance sector to push the envelope on innovative sources of fi nancing, or crowding-in 5 private-sector capital (Qureshi, 2016). Governments can \"crowd-in\" additional f unding sources by increasi ng the demand for goods through public funds, and sharing risk in various ways, which then catalyzes private investment that would not have otherwise taken place (P owers and Butterfield, 2014). Additionally, to provide more certainty for the private sector in investing, U.S. gove rnment global health programs could include a provision to provide matching funds for public-private partnerships, which have proven to be effective in encouraging companies to invest through other programs such as PEPFAR, Power Africa, and the Mille nnium Challenge Corporation (Sturchio and Schneider, 2017). For countries that the United States will continue to support through DAH, current investments can be made more effective a nd efficient, thus helping to stretch farther the 5 Crowding-in is an economic principle in which private investment increases as debt-financed government spending increases. This is caused by government spending boosti ng the demand for goods, which in turn increases private demand for new output sources. Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

This could be accomplished through integration of serv ices as discussed in Chapter 6, and through the many PPPs highlighted in this report, so an established platform like PEPFAR can be used to address additional health burdens without much increase in cost. Stressing Increased Efficiency and Cost-Effectiveness Overall, many viable tools, including debt buy-downs, social impact bonds, and other mechanisms not discussed in this chapter such as impact investing, microfinance schemes, traditional equity investments can improve the accessibility of funds and efficiency of global health programs (Sturchio and Schneider, 2017). The historical challenges and limitations of traditional bilateral aid from the U.S. government make the contracting process slow and dated, and the outcomes not as effective as they c ould be. These new methods, though not risk-free, offer a fresh perspective to aid disbursement a nd new opportunities. Many experts have reviewed and assessed various innovative fi nancing mechanisms in much more detail than is called for in this report, but these expert analyses should be consulted when designing changes to global health investments to ensure fit-for-purpose a nd avoid recreation of m echanisms (Atun et al., 2012; de Ferranti et al., 2008; Sturchio a nd Schneider, 2017). Encouraging more cooperation between U.S. development finance tools can also maximize impact when multiple agencies are brought together to work across sectors. SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS Current U.S. global health financing is fo cused largely on immediate disease-specific priorities such as HIV/AIDS or malaria. This financial support is seen as development and humanitarian assistance for strate gic partner countries, rather th an as a means of achieving long- term goals of building global health systems a nd platforms that are disease-agnostic and can respond rapidly and flexibly to emerging diseases that threaten the en tire world, including the United States. However, these cross-cutting systems a nd platforms can produce large returns and long-term benefits. For example, smallpox erad ication saves the United States the one-time expenditures it invested every 26 days, and the gl obal benefits of avoi ded infections outweigh the global costs 159:1 (Barrett, 2013). Similarly, efforts towards polio eradication are projected to generate net returns of up to $50 billion by 2035 (Duintjer Tebbens et al., 2010), but even more returns will remain out of reach if the handf ul of polio cases diagnosed each year continue and annual funding is still required. As countries continue to grow economically, their needs will change from direct support for drugs, diagnostics, and other commodities to technical support and sustainable financing from multiple sources. Additionally, current investments in global health also can be made more effective and efficient. For example, existing programs such as PEPFAR or the work of BARDA can be augmented through public -private partnerships to ha ve a greater impact on health outcomes in countries. Furthermore, there are op portunities for working with the finance sector to allow more flexibility and innovation in fi nancing mechanisms for programs. Given the limitations of traditional federal bilateral aid fr om the U.S. government, new methods such as impact investing, microfinance schemes, and equ ity investments could improve the accessibility of funds and efficiency of global health programs (Sturchio and Schenider, 2017).

All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States SMART FINANCING STRATEGIES 8-17 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Finally, the private sector ha s a clear interest in preven ting deaths and improving living conditions for many international populations\u2014 both of which promote economic development, create new markets, and contribute to better ope rating conditions for businesses (Sturchio and Goel, 2012). As 82 percent of capital reaching LMIC s comes from the private sector, there are many opportunities for both donors and national reci pient governments to bolster the health and development agenda more effectively (Nathan, 2017). Conclusion: The U.S. government needs to conduct more strategic and systematic assessments with an eye toward making long- term investments in global health instead of focusing on shor t-term expenditures. Conclusion: Increased financial gains in middle-income countries and a plethora of new and committed global health partne rs have created an opportunity for the United States to take smarter and more creative directions when financing global health programs. A variety of innov ative financing mechanisms are being employed around the world, and there is a need for expansion and diversification of current U.S. financing methods. Conclusion: Thinking more strategically about how to help countries transition out of bilateral aid programs and optimiz e their use of domestic resources in a sustainable way is an impor tant future role of th e United States. Providing assistance to low- and middle-income countries in structuring debt ratios and tax initiatives in ways that can build stro nger and more holistic health systems can provide multiple returns on investments, and is a next step for donor governments. Recommendation 12: Transition Inves tments Toward Global Public Goods The U.S. Agency for International Development, the U.S. Department of State, and the Department of Health and Human Services should, together, systematically assess their approach to global health funding with an eye toward making long-term investments in high-impact, country-level programs. The focus should be on progr ams that both build national health systems and provide the greatest value in terms of global health security (to prevent pandemics), as well as respond to humanitarian emergencies and provide opportunities for joint research and development for essential drugs, diagnostics, and vaccines that will be nefit many countries, including the United States. Recommendation 13: Optimize Resources Through Smart Financing Relevant agencies of the U.S. government should expand efforts to complement direct bilateral support fo r health with financing mechanisms that include results-based financing; risk sharing; and attracting funding from private investment, recipient governments, and other donors. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) should structure their financing toCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Assistance should be provided in developing innovative financing products/modalities and in working with the finance sector to push the envelope on innovative sources of financing, crowding in pr ivate-sector capital. USAID and PEPFAR should engage with ministries on system design and financing to assist in plan design, mo del refinement and expansion, return-on- investment analysis, and financial plan execution. USAID should expand the use and flexib ility of such mechanisms as the Development Credit Authority, and the U. S. Treasury, the U.S. Department of State, and USAID should motivate the World Bank; the International Monetary Fund; the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, T uberculosis and Malaria; and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, respectively, to promot e transitioning to domestic financing, assist countries in creating fiscal space for health, leverage fiscal policies to improve health, and attract al ternative financing sources.

America has the best chance to win the war on terror and defeat the terrorists by enhancing our medical and humanitarian assistance to vulnerable countries.\" \u2014Former Secretary of Health and Human Services Tommy Thompson (2005 Boston Globe editorial) Throughout this report the committee has reiter ated the need to understand the changing landscape of health, which is strongly influen ced by globalization, climate change, increased travel and trade, and increased life expectancies around the globe. Despite these global changes, history has proven that advanci ng foreign policy and national secu rity can be achieved through and by health. Global health itself has long been used as a tool to advance foreign policy interests, including security and influence (Feldbaum and Mi chaud, 2010). The scope of global health in diplomacy was greatly expanded with the creation of the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1948, and since then, with the advent of the International San itary Regulations in 1951 (with subsequent updates to become the International H ealth Regulations (IHR) in 1969 and 2005). The involvement of the United States in the creation of th e Global Fund to Fight acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), Tuberc ulosis (TB) and Malaria (Global Fund) in 2002, the rollout of the President's Emergency Pl an for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) in 2003, and the development of the Global Heal th Security Agenda (GHSA) in 2014, shows the continuing need for a U.S. role in global hea lth diplomacy has not abated. To maintain the status of the United States as a global health leader and ensure safety for its people, the committee argues it will be essential to stay engaged and involved in international agencies, collaborations, and partnerships. A strong connection to the many multilateral organizations involved in global health and development is crit ical to maintain situational awareness and a keen recognition of when a sm all scale problem could erupt into a global emergency. Consider the example of the involvement of U.S. di plomats in the international response in Nigeria in 2003, when Northern Nigerian states banne d polio immunization campaigns, leading to a global outbreak and e nding hopes of eradicating the disease in that decade (Kaufmann and Feldbaum, 2009). Though it was difficult for U.S. health officials to understand the diplomatic tools th ey had, together with the Globa l Polio Eradica tion Initiative and the United Nations (UN), U.S. diplomats ra ised the issue on multiple state visits to the middle east and through the U.S. Embassy in Nigeri a, getting other countr ies to put pressure on Nigeria, where the governor eventually rest arted vaccination (Kaufmann and Feldbaum, 2009). This is just one example demonstrating the benefits of taking a strategic a pproach to U.S. efforts in global health diplomacy. This chapter opens with a review of th e definitions and needs for global health governance, including the recent calls for reform of the WHO following the 2014-2015 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, and newly established multilateral organizations.

Despite many criticisms, there is still a need for WHO and its strong convening power to coordinate the many new global health players and set norms and standard s in global health care (The PLoS Medicine Editors, 2007). Yet, the response to the 2014 Ebola outbreak demonstrated th at the current state of global health governance is no t adequate to manage and res pond to the health needs of all countries, and there is a need for reform. Calls for WHO Reform The 2014 Ebola outbreak exposed major vulner abilities in the WHO emergency response capabilities and leadership structure, such as poor IHR comp liance, lack of technical capacity, unstable financing and lack of accountabi lity (Moon et al., 2017). To address those vulnerabilities, several commissions were convened in the year after the height of the outbreak to discuss areas of WHO governance and outbreak response improvement.1 Each of the commissions emphasized the need for reform s in WHO outbreak response and global governance (Gostin et al., 2016). The Ebola response was hindered by poor coordination at global, national, and subnational levels; therefore, the commissions r ecommended that outbreak preparedness at all levels be refocused as the core of WHO wo rk. Overall, the commissions recommended the creation of a Centre for Emergency Preparedne ss and Response to integrate and strengthen WHO's preparedness, response, and humanitarian activities (G ostin et al., 2016). With the understanding that WHO has cut nearly two-thir ds of its emergency response unit, this new governing body would fill a much-needed gap that will declare public health emergencies of international concern (PHEICs) and coordinate responses more quickly. The commissions also recommended WHO lead the assessments of count ries' implementation of the core capacities outlined in the IHR (Gostin et al., 2016). While nations must be held responsible for developing their own infrastructure to re spond to emerging health threats, the commissions argued that WHO must coordinate global prep aredness and hold nations account able for its maintenance. The legitimacy and ability of WHO to respond in an outbr eak are contingent upon strong governance at all levels. Described as suffering from a \"crisis of confidence,\" WHO was asked to make a number of reforms by the commissions to ensure it remains a global leader in health (Gostin et al., 2016). Specifically, the commission s recommended that to prepare for outbreaks, WHO should partner with countries to ensure th ey have the technical support required to implement the core capacities necessary to comp ly with IHR, with the ultimate goal of having every government develop and publish concrete plans to achieve these core capacities by 2020 (Gostin et al., 2016). Additionally, the commissions recommended that WHO take the role of watchdog in ensuring that restrictions on travel and trade set by nations during outbreaks are justified, so that countries e xperiencing outbreaks are not unju stly punished (Moon et al., 2017). Possible solutions, including \"naming and shaming\" countries that impose unj ustified restrictions 1 Commissions for WHO reform included (1) the World Health Organization (WHO) Ebola Interim Assessment Panel (WHO Interim Assessment); (2) the Harvard University and the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine's Independent Panel on the Global Response to Ebola (Harvard/LSHTM); (3) the Commission on a Global Health Risk Framework for the Future (CGHRF) convened by the U.S. National Academy of Medicine; and (4) the United Nations High-Level Panel on the Global Response to Health Crises (UN Pane l) (Gostin et al., 2016).

Fina lly, the commissions recommended that WHO reform its internal structure through better management of human resources, increased transparency and accountability through a freedom of informa tion policy, creation of an inspector general role, and mars haling of more effective lead ership (Moon et al., 2017). Up to the release of this report, the work to implement the recommended changes has begun, but is far from finished, and the success of these reforms is contingent upon sustainable funding. Multiple assessments and commissions have called for improved funding for WHO (Gostin et al., 2016; Ebola Interim Assessment Pane l, 2015); to ensure that countries have the capacity to implement and maintain the IHR, WHO has leveraged additi onal funding to help countries that need assistance. The Group of Se ven (G7) has committed to assisting 76 countries at the 2015 and 2016 summits (Moon et al., 2017). The United States has committed $1 billion for building capacities in 31 countries, largely through the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA), and South Korea has pledged $100 million to support 13 countries. Additionally, in an effort to find better methods to mobilize both domestic resources and development assistance, the World Bank has \"Sought funding to assist at least 25 countries with pandemic preparedness plans in its latest financing round and established an internat ional working group on financing preparedness in November 2016\" (Moon et al., 2017, p. j280). Despite th e financial support for improvements, no formal programs or new guideli nes have been announced for travel and trade restrictions for those that do not follow the IHR, and \"WHO has not initiated any major institutional reforms since the Ebola outbreak \" (Moon et al., 2017). While the improvements in financing and engagement from member countries is encouragi ng, ensuring reforms that improve transparency will be of vital importance for the or ganization to continue to be the lead authority in global health. Finding: The WHO performs essential functions for the global community, including the setting of inte rnational standards, such as the International Health Regulations, and the provision of technical advice and guidance to national health authorities. Finding: Multiple calls have been made for management and operational reforms of the WHO to improve future responses to public health emergencies of international concern. Strong and Promising International Organizations While many countries look to WHO as an auth oritative leader in global health, several other multilateral organizations and partnerships that have been created in the last 15 years now play extremely important roles in global health governance. Organizatio ns such as the Global Fund to Fight AIDS and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, have constituency-based models of governance and narrowly-defined missions that enable more flexibility and support to accomplish their goals. As multiple infectious disease outbreaks have immediately threatened global health security in the past several year s, newer partnerships have been formed just since 2014, including the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innov ation (CEPI) and the GHSA. CEPI, supported by Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States GLOBAL HEALTH LEADERSHIP 9-5 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS the governments of Germany, Japan, and Norway, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and the Wellcome Trust, is initially investing $540 million to finance and coordinate the development of new vaccines to protect against infectious diseases (CEPI, 2017). While new, it has shown strong commitment from supporters through enga gement and funding, and holds promise for accelerating capacity building a nd critical medical product development. Because GHSA was launched as a partnership by the Un ited States, and has received pos itive feedback thus far on its progress, the committee has included more detailed examples of its successes. Global Health Security Agenda As introduced in Chapter 3, the U.S. govern ment undertakes a si gnificant number of activities within GHSA, but the agenda is a global one. Currently, GHSA has a membership of 55 countries, as well as WHO, the World Orga nisation for Animal Health, and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (GHSA, 201 6), and has endorsements from the G7 and Group of 20 (HHS, 2017). Furthermore, the GHS A's unique operating style allows the United States to maintain a leadership role in gl obal health security while encouraging shared responsibility with partner countries through it s 10-country steering group (GHSA, 2016). This work is also supported by a roundtable of several private-sector partners that strives to mobilize industry to help countries prepare for emergencies and strengthen health systems, and aims to be a clearinghouse for industry to re spond to health emergencies in collaboration with governments and multilateral stakeholders (Private Sector Roundtable, n.d.). The roundtable has even set up working groups aligning with member capabil ities across the action packages, including Supply Chain and Logistics; Policy Development and Advocacy; Workforce Development; Partnerships, Technology and Analytics; and Antimicrobial Resistance. Because of its convening of multi-sectoral actors and coordination at both the White House and in-country levels, GHSA has shifted th e U.S. government health security approach from a fragmented strategy\u2014a characterizati on of many global health programs\u2014to a more coherent and cohesive one. In bringing multiple or ganizations and sectors to the table, including the United States, GHSA provides a different, mo re innovative approach to answering the world's global health secur ity issues through comprehensiv e assessments and technical assistance. Additionally, in part because of incr eased accountability and partnership, the abilities of countries to prevent, detect, and respond to outbreaks have improved. For example, the United States has strengthened the public health labor atory and surveillance systems in Uganda, in addition to supporting the creation of a public he alth emergency operating centers (EOCs). The first test of this occurred in March 2016 when an outbreak of yellow fever was contained by the Uganda Ministry of Health through the quick activation of the EOC and improved lab capacity (GHSA, 2017). In 2015 alone, GHSA was able to produce measurable improvements in national capacities to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious di sease threats: 9 count ries established or strengthened mechanisms to limit animal-to-human spillover; 17 c ountries participated in field epidemiology training programs (FETPs); and 12 countries activated EOCs (GHSA, 2017). The United States can capitalize on this mo mentum for global health security. By continuing to provide technical a nd financial assistance and collabo rate with partners to help countries assess and improve their national health security capacities, together the world can more effectively contain outbreaks, as well as promote evidence-based plans for limiting the global spread of disease (Nuzzo and Shearer, 2017).

All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States 9-6 GLOBAL HEALTH AND THE FUTURE ROLE OF THE UNITED STATES PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Finding: Many international agencies, or ganizations, and partnerships are now critical parts of the global health architecture and also carry out essential global functions. U.S. APPROACH TOWARD GLOBAL HEALTH DIPLOMACY American foreign policy has long been the \"thr ee-legged stool\" of defense, development, and diplomacy. Though the defense leg has been the main driver, it will continually be important for the United States to be able to tell its stor y in ways that do not include military force. The military needs civilian partners in the battle against extremism. This idea of soft power\u2014the ability to attract others without force or coercion through development efforts, including in health\u2014is supported by a rationale that it reinfo rces American values, improves how the United States is viewed by the rest of the world by pr omoting peace and prosper ity, and contributes to U.S. security at home by building stability abroad (Armitage and Nye, 2007). Consider the example of the falling of the Berlin Wall, where U. S. diplomacy shared a central role in bringing an end to the cold war, and encouraging Amer ican values of free speech and democratic governance to citizens in other countries (Kuo, 2016). This can also be applied to fighting terrorism. A RAND study in 2008 examined more than 600 terro rist groups since 1968 and found that the majority of them have ended because they either joined the political process or because key members were arrested or killed by local police and intelligence (Jones and Libicki, 2008). The RAND authors found that rarely has m ilitary force been the reason for the ending of terrorist groups. Many opportunitie s like this still exist to prot ect American interests through development and soft-power diplomacy initiatives , and if the United Stat es fails to act through the other 2 legs of the foreign policy stool, other countries are likely to fi ll this role instead. In the last few decades, China has quietly in creased many of its health and development programs around the world, asserting itself as a powerful and committed leader both through bilateral programs and taking a leadership role in multilateral organizations. China's flexibility and lack of conditionality in its aid progr ams has generated large amounts of good will and political capital in the world (A rmitage and Nye, 2007). China has sent more than 15,000 doctors to Africa and has treated nearly 180 million African patients, which has helped to ensure its long-term foreign policy interests in energy a nd food security (McGiffert, 2009). Additionally, Cuba has sent medical staff a nd medical diplomats to about 70 countries and provided free medical training in return for various benefits , including oil from Venezuela (Fieinsilver, 2009). How countries spend their money overseas direct ly reflects their priorities. People on the receiving end understand this notion, and in tu rn often base their op inions on these aid and development decisions, setting th e stage for how various wealthy countries are viewed globally (Armitage and Nye, 2007). As evidenced through previous chapter disc ussions about globalization, the growing economies of many low- and middle-income countri es, and the proliferation of private sector players in the global health sphere, there is a clear need to change the way the United States engages in foreign policy and development assist ance. Specifically, as countries graduate from bilateral aid, the U.S. government could transition away from th e provision of aid towards the sharing of technical assistance as countries m obilize their own resources and develop health systems, fiscal policies, and surveillance syst ems. Doing so will allow the United States to maintain close relationships with partner countries and an awareness of health issues they face, while allowing funds typically allocated to fo reign aid to be spen t on other global goods. Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States GLOBAL HEALTH LEADERSHIP 9-7 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS However, there are a limited number of countri es in this position, and those low-income countries will still depend on donor governments like the United States for foreign aid until they can advance their economies. These countries, so metimes also afflicted by conflict or poor governance, can also be a source of insecurity an d instability for global health, so a continued commitment of direct aid will st ill be critical. Currently, a num ber of U.S. agencies, including the U.S. Department of State and U.S. Departme nt of Health and Huma n Services, coordinate global health interests abroad. But there is a need to better coordinate the activities of these agencies, with long-term strategic vision and cr oss-cutting approaches in order to maximize efforts and efficiency. Finding: The role of the United States in global diplomacy has proven useful in events ranging from the falling of the Be rlin Wall to the resuming of Nigeria's polio vaccination campaign. Finding: Other countries, such as Ch ina and Cuba, have increased their participation in global health and development around the world, positively affecting how they are viewed globally. The Role of the U.S. Department of State The U.S. Department of State (State Depart ment) is the primary agency responsible for foreign affairs, and global health is interwoven into its structure and activiti es in both its regional bureaus and functional bureaus. Table 9-1 provides an overview of the functional bureaus and their offices, which explicitly conduct activities that relate to global health. The Office of International Health and Biodefense is the prim ary office responsible for global health issues (U.S. Department of State, 2017b) 2, but the other offices listed offer pockets of knowledge and work in a variety of domains that include biolog ical weapons contro l and nonproliferation, biosecurity, GHSA, finance, and migration (ISAB , 2016). Given the range of offices within the State Department that work on global health, it is apparent that the department considers global health a vital, cross-cutting issue. However, th e strengths within these bureaus on global health are not mirrored by similar strengths at U.S. em bassies, which often lack personnel with global health expertise. 2 The Office of International Health and Biodefense leads th e State Department's efforts for pandemic response, and ensures that global health issues, such as emerging inf ectious diseases, global health security and antimicrobial resistance, are incorporated into U.S. foreign policy.

Although health is a component of ESTH offi cers' portfolios (ISAB, 2016), it is not the strongest part of their training (NASEM, 20 15). Not only do ESTH officers receive inadequate health trai ning (a mere 1.5 hours in global health at the Foreign Service Institute) (ISAB, 2016), there is a sentiment that ESTH postings are outside the mainstream FSO career track. Due to the up-or-out promotion sy stem within the State Department (OIG, 2002), FSOs reportedly lack interest to pursue such postings (NASEM, 2015). In embassies that lack ESTH officers, the health portfolio is managed by economic officers.3 The neglect of global health in the Foreign Service career track system (which includes consular, economic, management, political, and public diplomacy) (U.S . Department of State, 2017a) means that the State Department's workforce lacks the requisite skills for sustainable approaches to global health, which can result in the develo pment of ad hoc solutions and policy. Although the lack of this specific workforce cap acity is not always evident, it comes into sharp focus in the midst of a large-scale global health event. Consider the example of the U.S. response to the 2014-2015 Ebola outbreak in West Af rica, where the State Department formed an Ebola coordination unit using \"ambassadorial leadership and staff borrowed from across the department\" (ISAB, 2016, p. 20). The unit was compri sed almost entirely of FSOs, but only two had a background in science. This issue was also notable in an analysis of the previously mentioned polio vaccination response in Nigeria in 2003, where public health professionals were found to lack the skills needed to approach mini stries of foreign affairs. Similarly, diplomats required greater training on the ro le of health in foreign policy (Kaufmann and Feldbaum, 2009). If more staff members had public or global he alth backgrounds, stronger alliances could have been built during the relief effort (Chen, 2015). These ad-hoc, stand-alone groups, like the now- defunct Avian Influenza Action Group, do not allow for learning or the development of institutional knowledge for future events because they often disband immedi ately after the crisis ends (ISAB, 2016). Strategizing for Downstream Effects While many global health programs are measured in terms of direct health outcomes and perhaps cost-effectiveness, appropriately designed programs can also have multiple downstream effects on other sectors of society. These downs tream effects can affect poverty, education, or employment, and in turn provide diplomatic advantages for the donor government (Feldbaum and Michaud, 2010; Kevany, 2015). PEPFAR is one of the most robust and well-known U.S. global health programs, has had measured succes s in several nonhealth ar eas, as discussed in Chapter 4, and is overseen by the Office of Globa l AIDS Coordinator at the State Department. This position also leads the Office of Gl obal Health Diplomacy (OGHD) at the State Department, though since its creation in 2013, the OGH D has not been as targeted and effective with its efforts as many had hoped. Moving forw ard, OGHD could offer an opportunity for the United States to be more strategic about its so ft power development and diplomacy initiatives, and to align them with the ongoing critical investments in health across the U.S. government that have been made in the last decade. If adequately funded, a central office such as OGHD could guide U.S. global health policy through a more coherent approach, and elevate the issues of health and development worldwide while givi ng them greater credence within the U.S. 3 Personal communication Matthew Brown, Nationa l Institutes of Health, November 9, 2016. Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States 9-10 GLOBAL HEALTH AND THE FUTURE ROLE OF THE UNITED STATES PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS government. Importantly, part of the success of the PEPFAR program and the whole-of- government approach is the important work that is implemented by other government agencies such as the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). With th eir technical competence and established in- country networks, these two organizations significan tly contribute to the health diplomacy of the United States. If the health programs were desi gned and measured for indicators beyond just health outcomes, their use and knowledge generati on could be attractive to foreign policy experts and decision makers (Kevany, 2015). Accordingly, having FSOs with global health expertise would be important to complement the work of implementing agencies, and support the State Department's day-to-day functi oning and its responses to health emergencies as they occur. Building on lessons learned from the failed Global Health Initiative (describ ed in Chapter 1), in order for this to be successful OGHD woul d require funding, accountability, and authority. The Role of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and its agencies, such as CDC, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and th e National Institutes of Health (NIH), also play a vital role in global health, including global health diplomacy. These agencies are responsible for U.S. health program implemen tation, technical advisory actions, and health workforce training programs. HHS also engages at a high level of diplomacy with partner countries by using a specialized cadre of work ers known as health attach\u00e9s, the definition and roles of which are presented in Box 9-1 (Brown et al., 2014). BOX 9-1 Definition and Role of Health Attach\u00e9s Health attach\u00e9s are defined as diplomats \"who collect, analyze, and act on information concerning health in a foreign country or countries and provide critical links between public health and foreign affairs stakeholders.\" They work in the realm of core global health diplomacy, and because of their role in conducting policy negotiations on behalf of the U.S. government, health attach\u00e9s must have sound technical skills in public health as well as skills in the conventional diplomatic fields of political, economic, and public affairs. SOURCE: Brown et al., 2014 Health attach\u00e9s, though officially working at U.S. embassies abroad, are typically on-loan from HHS agencies. Often populated by employees with field experience serving from CDC or NIH, placement and support of health attach\u00e9s is coordinated by the HHS Office of Global Affairs (OGA) (HHS, 2016b), which acts as the central leadership for all of HHS's global activities (Bliss, 2014). As a re sult, health attach\u00e9s report to OGA at the headquarters level,4 but they also report directly to the U.S. ambassador of the embassy to which they are assigned (U.S. Department of State and USAID, 2010). The United States curr ently has six health attach\u00e9s posted in Brazil, China, India, Mexico, Sout h Africa, and Switzerland. While the first five 4 Personal communication with Matthew Brown, Na tional Institutes of Health, January 5, 2017. Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States GLOBAL HEALTH LEADERSHIP 9-11 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS support U.S. embassies in direct country to count ry relationships, the health attach\u00e9 posted in Geneva, Switzerland offers support to the U. S. mission to the United Nations (HHS, 2016b). Health attach\u00e9s have played a critical role at U.S. missions. A notable example was the bilateral negotiation that took place between the United States and China during the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome outbreak. The h ealth attach\u00e9 posted in Beijing brokered a memorandum of understanding between the Chinese Ministry of Health and HHS to form the U.S.-China Collaboration of Emerging and Reemer ging Infections (U.S. Department of State, 2010).5 Although the agreement itself was positive for health-related outcomes at the time, the ongoing relationship that was develo ped served as a platform for collaboration in the subsequent H5N1 and Ebola epidemics. During the H5N1 pandemic in 2005, this agreement enabled smoother sharing of information, and during the Ebola outbreak in 2014, the agreement clarified roles each country would play in the response (in which China built a treatment center in Liberia and a 60-bed hospital in Sierra Leone).6 This partnership has since been renewed for 5 years in 2015 (Huang, 2016). Creating an International Workforce Despite the clear value of the expertise br ought by health attach\u00e9s, there is limited placement of health attach\u00e9s at U.S. missions. Th is is partly because of inadequate funding, as the annual cost of placement can be close to $500,000 per year.7 Yet more importantly, the limited placement of health attach es is due to a lack of approp riately experienced personnel to draw from\u2014resulting from limitations in how HHS can hire for overseas positions. For new employees or outside hires, HHS uses term a ppointments to hire and deploy personnel abroad. While this in itself is not a problem, the lack of a global health career track in HHS and the temporary, ad hoc nature of the available positions makes these positions one-off and not attractive to a talented pool of candidates. At the conclusion of their term, employees often leave the U.S. government to seek a career in global he alth elsewhere, taking with them critical cross- cultural, management, leadership, and scientific skills that can take years or decades to acquire. However, HHS's workforce abroad has expande d between 2000 and 2015 from less than 50 to more than 500 in more than 70 countries. Desp ite this expansion though, HHS has an average standing vacancy rate of more than 30 percent for its overseas positions. 8 As a result, many positions go unfilled or have large gaps between incumbents, which create deficits in HHS's ability to ensure the safety a nd security of the U.S. population.9 Furthermore, due to the lack of a predictable and unified process of rotating HHS employees in a nd out of overseas positions, the department is unable to maintain institutional knowledge of overseas operations and is not flexible enough to meeting its expanding global mandate.10 HHS has acknowledged this weakness, and in American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene editorial, Nils Daulaire (fo rmer Assistant Secretary fo r OGA) stated that OGA is working to \"establish a global health career track within HHS to formalize career opportunities and training for our staff work ing in global health, both domes tically and internationally\" (Daulaire, 2012).

More than 200 HHS employees applied to GB AS and 90 were selected to be matched to U.S. missions. As of November 2016, 23 percen t of the selected HHS employees seeking overseas placements have been matched a nd are in the process of being deployed.11 However, as of the release of this report, GBAS has not been renewed or taken to scale. Finding: The limited number of noncareer he alth appointments currently available abroad is an ad hoc system. It does no t facilitate institutional knowledge across events or a promising career track for global health professionals. A PLACE FOR HEALTH IN FOREIGN SERVICE Between the State Department and HHS, the U.S. government has an inadequate workforce to meet its global health needs. Owing to the neglect of global health in the Foreign Service career track system and limited knowle dge of health by ESTH officers, the State Department is unable to address global health in a concerted fashion across its embassies. Similarly, because of the inability to consistently deploy employees overseas, HHS is unable to build institutional knowledge on vital global heal th matters or develop a workforce that has global health experience. The latter is problemat ic as it limits the number of individuals with appropriate competencies that HHS can draw from to appoint health attaches and other needed positions. With the ever-changing landscape of global health, and the constant array of threats that have the potential to affect the health of Americans, a cons tant standing workforce deployed abroad that is well versed in global health w ould benefit the United States. Current efforts to address this issue, which include courses a nd certificates in diplomacy and science and technology, are not able to address competency issues in the work force in a scalable and real- world fashion. Furthermore, current mechanisms to inject global health expertise into the State Department, such as the limited noncareer appoi ntments, while useful in filling workforce deficiencies for programs like PEPFAR (U.S. De partment of State, 2017c) are short-term solutions and fail to address the loss of institutio nal knowledge and the need for the creation of a true global health career track. 12 Establishing a global health career track in the State Department would address the workforce deficiencies described above. Howeve r, this would require a strong commitment by State to build global health as a career path and elevate it as a cr itical issue. This could happen similarly to how the State Department elevat ed economic diplomacy by increasing training in economics, establishing a chief economist, and creating a role of an Undersecretary for Economic Growth, Energy, and the Environment\u2014 as was described in the 2010 Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review (U.S. Depa rtment of State and USAID, 2010). Creating a global health track would first involve establishi ng a skill code for public health in the Foreign Service and more thoroughly intr oducing global health into the Sc hool of Professional and Area Studies, perhaps by creating a dean at the Foreign Service Institute.13 This would establish a solid foundation for global health within the Foreign Service, but it would need to be supplemented by designating positions for global hea lth at all levels with in the department to 11 Personal communication with Matthew Brown, Na tional Institutes of Health, November 9, 2016. 12 Personal communication with Matthew Brown, Na tional Institutes of Health, January 9, 2017. 13 Personal communication with Matthew Brown, Na tional Institutes of Health, February 6, 2017.

Though this wo uld be resource intensive, it could lead to a sustainable and proactive appro ach to addressing global heal th issues throughout the world within the State Department's purview. Enabling Knowledge Sustainment Because it will take time for the State Depa rtment to establish the global health career track, an integrated system with HHS and the State Department would enable HHS employees (who have a full depth of expertise in health-re lated issues, such as disease surveillance and research) to populate positions in the State Depart ment as the track gets developed, and can lead to cooperation during outbreaks a nd global health emergencies in the future. An amendment of the Foreign Service Act by Congress to author ize HHS to use the Foreign Service Personnel System14 would also be a first step to developing a foreign servi ce arm of HHS. As the State Department itself has called for more collaboration and workforce mobility between it and other departments and agencies to foster a whole- of-government approach to diplomacy (U.S. Department of State and USAI D, 2010), allowing HHS to access the Foreign Service Personnel System could help to foster this collaboration. Additionally, during public health emergencies, this foreign service arm designa tion would facilitate a rapid in jection of knowledgeable people from HHS into the State Department to meet temporary needs (U.S. Department of State and USAID, 2010), providing the U.S. government much needed agility and a more cohesive approach to responding to urgent threats. The need for a Foreign Service arm of HH S, namely at CDC, was echoed by multiple respondents from this committee's information ga thering solicitation (described in Chapter 1). With CDC's leading role in GHSA and the clear effects of emerging infectious disease threats on national security, it is evident that the current ad- hoc approach is insufficient and such an arm is needed. By using the Foreign Service Personnel System, HHS can enable employees to pursue a career in global health in the short term. In the long term, this would systematically build a global health workforce\u2014a necessary pre-requisi te for HHS to develop a pool from which to draw future health attaches to support U.S. embassy missions. Creating the Workforce Pipeline To create a sustainable U.S. workforce with these types of health and foreign diplomacy skills, it is important to think about the edu cation and skills needed. Universities are already creating environments that suppor t interdisciplinary education a nd research and blending majors to ensure cross-sector thinking a nd interaction. This is particularly relevant to the field of global health, with nearly 250 North American universiti es now offering global health education. This reflects the growing interest from American stud ents in global health as well as a trend of funding agencies turning to univers ities as problem solvers for gl obal health. Thes e networks of interdisciplinary collaboration and culture of re ciprocity make universit ies great environments for innovation. Pushing the feedback loop even further are entities like USAID's Higher Education Solutions Network, which is using this built expertise to help solve global health problems. These universities are prime locations to start integrating diplomacy skills and leadership into global health curricula in a manner that reflects the necessary shared competencies (Brown et al., 2016). As centers of learning already s upported by international 14 This would be similar to that of the Foreign Agri cultural Service and the Fore ign Commercial Service.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATION The developments described throughout this report have created an environment for a centralized and comprehensive st rategy for global health diplom acy. For the United States to continue to be a leader in globa l health, as well as adequately pr otect U.S. citizens at home and abroad, continued engagement in the internat ional global health arch itecture is paramount. Though there are many calls for management and operational reforms in WHO (Gostin et al., 2016), the functions that it performs will continue to be essential for global health security and prosperity. Additionally the increased number of other multilateral organizations focused on health, either directly or i ndirectly, provides an opportunity to synergize efforts towards achieving aligned global health goals more sust ainably and efficiently (Nuzzo and Shearer, 2017). The United States can maintain a health pr esence in countries in today's interconnected world while sustainably beginning to phase down direct aid programs. In the absence of a health career track in the Foreign Serv ice, the demand for U.S. health expertise in host countries cannot be sustainably filled and those that are deployed often lack diplomacy skills. Similarly, during an international health emergency, the State Department does not have historical experience and appropriate health knowledge networks to draw from, leading to ad hoc groups being formed for each new event that are much less effective than they could be (Chen, 2015; Kaufmann and Feldbaum, 2009). Conclusion: While the committee agr ees on the need for management and operational reform for the World Health Organization (WHO), it also recognizes that the organization is underfunded and that many f unctions it performs are essential. In addition, many other Unit ed Nations agencies and international organizations and partnerships formed in the last few decades are crucial in providing support around the world. The succe ss of all these entities will help the U.S. government accomplish its global he alth goals and maximize its returns on investments. Conclusion: Important priorities for the U.S. government, such as global health security, reduction of child mortality, research and development to create new tools and improve program de livery, and achievement of the goal of an AIDS-free generation, will depend on continued engageme nt with and strengthening of these established and emerging multilateral institutions. Conclusion: With the changi ng landscape of global health, the U.S. government has an opportunity to be more strategic in its programs and diplomacy. There is a need for better bidirect ional communication and partne rship between health and diplomacy professionals. Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

To this end, the U.S. Department of State and the U.S. Department of Health a nd Human Services (HHS) should do the following: Use their influence to improve the perf ormance of key United Nations agencies and other international organizations impo rtant to global health, particularly the World Health Organization (WHO). W HO is in need of greater resources to address the health challenges of the 21st century, and many of its priorities align with those of the U.S. government. However, U.S. government financial contributions to WHO should come with a requirement that the organization adopt and implement the much-needed man agement reforms identified in recent reports. Remain involved in and firmly committed to innovative global partnerships that further U.S. global health goals, such as the highly successful Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, as well as promising new entities such as the Global Health Security Agenda and the Global Financing Facility. Implement a more strategic approach to ac hieving global health goals. This new approach should include the commitment of the State Department to creating a global health career track and congressional action to enable the establishment of a cadre of global health experts wi thin HHS through an amendment to the Foreign Service Act. This would create the environment necessary to expand the health attach\u00e9 program, particular ly in middle-income countries. REFERENCES Armitage, R. L., and J. S. Nye Jr. 2007.

All countries are vulnerable to the ever-present threats of infect ious disease, outbreaks, and epidemics. At the same time, there are opportuni ties for shared innovation and universal purpose as many countries that suffer from similar diseas e burdens strive to develop best practices and strong health systems for their citizens. Throughout this consensus study, the committee emphasized the need for a more holistic examination of problems and challenges in global health. Such an approach applies not only to issues of global health security but also to the external factors th at influence health security, such as the building of genera l capacity in countries an d the creation of strong societies that foster stability, healthy lifestyles, a nd accessible economic opportunities. Unless core capacities and strong health systems are developed around the worl d, the global risk of infectious disease will continue to threaten the hea lth and security of the United States. Beyond the imperative of addressing infectious disease threats, it is n ecessary to understand the fundamental connection between health and economic pr osperity. In addition to the economic costs of responding to infectious disease outbreaks, the increasing prev alence of chronic or noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) has negatively affected global econom ies, compromising societal gains in life expectancy, productivity, and overall quality of life (WEF, 2017). Many countries currently face the dual burde n of a rapid increase in NCDs, such as cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer, and the continuing need to eliminate infectious diseases, such as malaria and tuberculos is (TB), and reduce their burden of human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficien cy syndrome (HIV/AIDS). Moreover, some countries are considered to bear a triple burde n, as traumatic injury has been found to be the second leading cause of premature death in young men after HIV/AIDS (Marquez and Farrington, 2013). Combined, these three disease burdens can stall the progress of a country's development and significantly aff ect its ability to become a str ong trading partner or a business or travel destination. The cost of productivity loss es associated with disability, unplanned absences, and increased accidents can be as mu ch as 400 percent higher than the cost of treatment (WEF, 2010). Research also shows that i nvestors are less likely to enter markets where the labor force suffers a heavy disease burden (Bloom et al., 2004). Human capital clearly contributes significantly to econom ic growth, and it follows that having a healthy population is critical for economic prosperity. This point has been demonstrated in recent years: between 2000 and 2011, 24 percent of income growth in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) resulted from improvements in health (Jamison et al., 2013). The root causes of all three of these health burdens are often linked by such underlying social factors as poverty, education, and lo cation (Frenk and Gomez-Dantes, 2016; Marmot, 2005). This commonality suggests that methods for prevention are linked as well, and the tools used to prevent one burden can help to preven t the others, emphasizing the need for holistic Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Over the last few decades, the United States has demonstrated remarkable leadership in global health, with notable progress achie ved by such initiatives as the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (P EPFAR) and the President's Malaria Initiative (PMI), as well as the nation's commitment to su ch multilateral organizatio ns as the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (Globa l Fund); Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance (Gavi); and, more recently, the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA) and efforts to combat antimicrobial resistance (AMR) at the national and internationa l levels. Against the backdrop of an influential legacy on the global health stage, the new U.S. ad ministration faces the choice of whether or not to ensure that the gains won with billions of U.S. dollars, years of dedication, and strong programs are sustained and poised for further growth. CHANGING THE WAY THE UNITED STATES ENGAGES The committee has focused this report wher e it believes the United States can have the most immediate and substantial effect despite the lim ited resources available. Throughout the report, the committee has highlighted four priori ty areas that demand co ntinued attention from U.S. global health investment within a two-prong ed approach of securing against global threats (areas 1 and 2), and promoting pr oductivity and economic growth in other countries (areas 3 and 4): 1. Achieving global health security (inc luding addressing pandemics and AMR) 2. Maintaining a sustained response to the con tinuous threats of communicable diseases such as HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria 3. Saving and improving the lives of women and children 4. Promoting cardiovascular heal th and preventing cancer In addition, the committee has underscored the imperative to change the way the United States does business in global health, highlighting an immedi ate need to focus on ensuring protection against global threats and enhanci ng productivity and economic growth in all countries. To these ends, a more systematic, proac tive, and integrated approach is needed that includes long-range planning and vision; greater application of rigor and measurement in achieving return on investment; and cooperation with all global hea lth partners to leverage the respective strengths of each, in cluding the advancement of innova tion through the private sector and political commitment to achieving global goals on the part of national governments and multilateral partners. This shift in approach places the focus on prevention and preparedness, with a vision of investing in cr oss-cutting infrastructure in thr ee areas: catalyzing innovation in health systems through medical product developmen t and digital health, enabling more flexible financing mechanisms to fund global health pr ograms, and maintaining U.S. global health leadership internationally. The out come of this approach will be resilient countries with positive health outcomes, resulting in turn in robust trad e partners, safer travel destinations, and more active collaborators in preventing and controlling global health problems that affect citizens in every country, at every income level.

However, the world continues to evolve, and public health measures must change accordingly. The global co mmunity is no safer from infectious disease today than it was 20 years ago when the report America's Vital Interest in Global Health (IOM, 1997) was written. The U.S. Army recently estimat ed that if a severe infectious disease pandemic were to occur today, the number of U. S. fatalities could be almost double the total number of battlefield fatalities sustained in all of the nation's wars since the American Revolution (GAO, 2017). Poverty and climate change have led to greater risk of mosquito-borne illness in the southern United States (Hotez et al., 2014); AMR has been elevated to a global crisis by the United Nations (UN) (UN, 2016); and the largest outbr eak of influenza A (H7N9) to date is currently occurring in China (Iuliano et al., 2017). The risk of transnational outbreaks may be greater today than ever before given rece nt dramatic increases in international trade and travel, urbanization, and populati on density, as well as critical biodiversity loss worldwide. Strong public health infrastructure is essential to combat these thre ats successfully wherever they may emerge. While the burden of infectious di seases rests predominantly with low-income countries, where limited resources and weak h ealth care systems are unable to control and prevent them, these are global threats that can significantly affect any country, including the United States, and that need to be underst ood as a threat to U.S. national security. As noted above, the costs of infectious diseases extend beyond human suffering and mortality through indirect impacts on economies. In just a few short months, for example, the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) cost the world $30-$54 billion (Fan, 2003; World Bank, 2013). During the Ebola out break, which involved just four domestic cases, the United States spent $1.1 billion on domestic respon se (Epstein et al., 2015)\u2014120 percent of the annual public health and health care preparedness budget for state and local health department and hospital capacity.1 Between October 2014 and December 2015, $119 million was spent just on domestic migration and quarantine activities, such as airport screening and follow- up of potentially sick passengers, costing an average of more than $4,000 per passenger (CDC, 2016).2 And direct costs for just two Ebola patients treated at the specia lty center in Nebraska were estimated at more than $1 million (Gold, 2014). Looking forward, a moderate influenza pandemic3 is projected to cost the world $570 billion annually in terms of in come loss and mortality (Fan et al., 2016) with some estimates as high as $2 trillion (Burns et al., 2008). Furtherm ore, the threat of AM R continues to grow because of poor stewardship, weak surveillance systems, and a lack of second-line therapeutics in the development pipeline. And in addition to naturally occurring threats is the potential for terrorist use of manmade biologi cal weapons. Regardless of whether epidemics or biosecurity threats originate naturally or th rough human engineering, it is cri tical for the United States to recognize the severity of these threats and take proactive me asures to build capacities and establish sustainable and cost-effective infrastructure to combat them. 1 This percentage was calculated by using fiscal year (FY) 2016 Public Health Emergency Preparedness Program funding ($660 million) and Hospital Preparedness Program funding ($255 million) as the preparedness amounts. See Chapter 3 for more details. 2 During this timeframe, 29,000 people were monitored followi ng screening at five major U.S. international airports. The monitoring included follow-up for 21 days, and a check and report Ebola kit including a thermometer, a prepaid cell phone, and educational materials. 3 A \"moderate\" influenza pandemic is defined as one in which global output is reduced by more than 2 percent.

The U.S. government implements extreme, government-wide responses to such occurrences\u2014costing tremendous amounts of time and money\u2014in a piecemeal, reactive fashion that can actually impede swift and efficient action, delaying re sponse and discouraging private- sector involvement. While multiple agencies can bring unique expertise to a U.S. government- led response, it is difficult to execute a coordina ted emergency plan in the midst of a crisis without a clear chain of command, a dedicated b udget, and designated leadership. There is a need for a framework to guide in ternational response to public health emergencies, similar to the domestic National Response Framework. While the Obama administration attempted this level of coordination on the fly with the creation of an Ebol a czar, it would be more effective to consider the need for coordination in advance. In addition to coordination, rapid access to funds during a respons e is of paramount importance to mobilizing assets and implementi ng needed interventions. After 7 months of disagreement and delay in fulfilling President Obama's request for $1.9 billion in Zika funding, Congress finally approved $1.1 billion with the passing of H.R. 5243 4 (Wexler et al., 2016). Before this approval was secured, agencies were forced to shift funds from other accounts for Zika-related activities, incl uding by borrowing money from the Ebola supplemental funding and from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control a nd Prevention's (CDC's) state-level emergency public health care preparedness account (Epste in and Lister, 2016; Kodjak, 2016). While the appropriate focus is on prevention and preparedne ss, some level of response will always be necessary. To enable swift and rapid respons e when necessary, the committee supports the creation of a public health emergency response fund, to be used only in declared health emergencies. Finally, the development of needed vaccine s, therapeutic agents, and diagnostics is severely inadequate to enable the United States and the world to respond effectively to these global health threats. Currentl y, product development for response to pandemic and bioterror threats depends on the interagency Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise, which is limited by annual approp riations and dependent on the goodwill of industry partners. Adequately protecting U.S. citizens requ ires long-term planning and vision that enables the development of strong and comprehensive ca pabilities to detect and diagnose pandemic threats wherever they occur, ensure the availabili ty of needed medical pr oducts, reduce the risk of transmission, and properly treat and care for infected patients here in the United States. A critical medical product development fund supporting long-term, stable research and development through the engagement of industry, academia, and other partners would ensure the development of critical drugs , vaccines, and diagnostics. Preparedness and Capacity Building for Global Health Security Public health infrastructure in most count ries, including the United States, is extremely underresourced or nonexistent, maki ng levels of preparedness, even for everyday emergencies, decades behind where they should be and allowi ng for significant risks when a disaster does strike. Funding levels for U.S. health preparedness have been severely reduced since the Public 4 Zika Response Appropriations Act, H.R. 5243. 2016. Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 10-5 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Health Security and Bioterrorism Response Act was enacted in 2002. A dual focus on health preparedness at home and abroad is essential to reduce the risk of outbr eaks and the transmission of infectious disease to U.S. citizens. To this end, it is necessary to build core preparedness capacities and public health infrastructure in the United States and in LMICs, supported by such partnerships as the GHSA. While a portion of the Ebola supplemental funding was directed toward nonspecific capacity building over 5 years, the sustainability of funding thereafter is unclear. This sustainability is also vulnerable to new or r eemerging diseases; Ebola funding was the first coffer proposed to be tapped upon the emergence of Zika (Epstein and Lister, 2016). By contrast, a sustained level of investment in multidisciplinary One Health systems5 can result in $15 billion in annual expected benefits from the preventi on of mild pandemics and other major outbreaks (World Bank, 2012). Assuming that improved system s could detect and control even half of incipient pandemics, the rates of return are well above those on nearly all other public spending and private capital markets (World Bank, 2012), making this capacity building a smart investment. Enabling the right institutional capacity to redu ce health risks, respond to emergencies, and innovate to improve the actions taken can dramatically improve the prevention and control of and response to hea lth threats. At the same time, it is essential to remain engaged and coordinated with domestic and internati onal stakeholders, includ ing the World Health Organization (WHO), the UN Secretary Gene ral's Committee on AMR, and the GHSA. Recommendation 1: Improve Internationa l Emergency Response Coordination The administration should create a c oordinating body for international public health emergency response that is accountable for international and domestic actions and oversees preparedness for and responses to global health security threats. This body should have its own budget, experience with handling logistics, and the authority necessary to coordinate players across the government at the deputy secre tary level. This coordinating body should do the following: Oversee the creation of an International Response Framework to guide the U.S. response to an international health emergency. Through this framework, this body would coordinate and direct activities involved in internatio nal response and preparedness, but would not duplicate functions already established in the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the U.S. Agency for International Development, or the U.S. Department of Defense. Oversee three separate funding stre ams, dedicated to investments in preparedness, emergency response, and critical medical product development. The Office of Mana gement and Budget should conduct an analysis to determine the approp riate levels for these three funding streams, commensurate with the associated risk, understanding that predictable and timely funds for these three purposes are critical. 5 Defined as the funding needed to bring major zoonotic disease prevention and control systems in developing countries up to World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) and World Health Organization (WHO) standards. The World Bank report estimates that th e required investments range from $1.9 billion to $3.4 billion per year. Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Recommendation 2: Combat Antimicrobial Resistance The U.S. Department of Health and Hu man Services, the U.S. Department of Defense, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) should continue to invest in national capabilities and accelerate the developmen t of international capabilities to detect, monitor, report, and combat anti biotic resistance. Efforts to this end should include the following: Enhance surveillance systems to en sure that new resistant microbial strains are identified as soon as they emerge. Assist low-income countries in improving infection control and antimicrobial stewardship. USAID should leverage current supply chain partnerships with other countries to strengthen antibiotic supply chains, thus reducing the use of illegitimate antimicrobial s and improving drug quality. Incentivize the development of therap eutics (including alternatives to antibiotics), vaccines, and diagnosti cs for use in humans and animals. Recommendation 3: Build Public Health Capa city in Low- and Middle-Income Countries The U.S. Centers for Disease Control a nd Prevention, the National Institutes of Health, the U.S. Department of Defense, and the U.S. Agency for International Development should expand training and information exchange efforts to increase the capaci ty of low- and middle-income countries to respond to both public health emergencies and acute mass casualty disasters. This training and informat ion exchange should encompass core capacities such as surveillance, epid emiology, and disaster and injury care response, as well as enhanced capabilities to improve communication and information pathways for the disse mination of innovative findings. Maintaining a Sustained Response to Conti nuous Threats: HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Considerable successes have been achieved in slowing the advancement of HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria worldwide, as evidenced by the m illions of lives saved. However, these diseases are continuing health threats that can jeopardi ze global security and in flict a high cost on the economies of the countries in which they are pr evalent. As of the e nd of 2015, there remained more than 36.7 million people living with HI V/AIDS globally (UNAIDS, 2015b), and there were more than 1.1 million deaths from AIDS (UNAIDS, 2015a). In 2015, 1.4 million people died from TB (WHO, 2016b), and 429,000 people died from malaria (WHO, 2016d). Complacency Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 10-7 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS toward these diseases can lead to severe risk and harm for the entire global community, as all three are capable of developing st rains resistant to currently available treatments. Should that occur, an even more lethal resurgence of thes e diseases would likely ta ke place, threatening all progress made on these diseases in previous decades. HIV/AIDS PEPFAR has played a key role in successfully slowing the HIV/AIDS epidemic globally since 2003, reducing new infections, and helping to save millions of lives around the world (PEPFAR, 2017). In addition to this progress on its primary goal, studies have shown that the countries in which PEPFAR is activ e had better opinions of the Un ited States (Daschle and Frist, 2015) and also saw 13 percent increase in employment rates among men compared to non- PEPFAR countries (Wagner et al., 2015). A truly bipartisan, collaborative program that has undergone transitions and shifts throughout the last 15 years, PEPFAR has adapte d its focus to changes in the HIV/AIDS epidemic from that of a highly lethal, rapi dly spreading emergency to one that requires sustaining care while targeting at-risk populations. Yet this work is far from finished, as 2 million new HIV infections still occur each year , and millions are without access to treatment (PEPFAR, 2017). The next phase of PEPFAR will continue to require cr oss-sector and data- driven efforts to dramatically reduce the number of new HIV infections and AIDS-related deaths globally by 2030, but will also rely on continued and expanded partnerships with the private sector and communities. A promising exampl e is PEPFAR's multidisciplinary Determined, Resilient, Empowered, AIDS-free, Mentored, and Safe women (DREAMS) partnership, which focuses on lowering rates of HIV infection in young women by addressing multiple factors outside of the health sector that affect rates of infection (e.g., enabling and encouraging them to stay in school, addressing gender-based viol ence, and changing community norms). Given the substantial reduction in the costs of drugs used to treat HIV/AIDS, the in creased involvement of private-sector partnerships, and the effect of treatment on preventing new infections, program ownership should continue shif ting to host countries where possible. PEPFAR also should leverage its existing structures a nd platforms to address other prio rity health issues for its HIV- infected patient population, based on country needs. Recommendation 4: Envision th e Next Generation of PEPFAR With its next reauthorization, Co ngress should fund the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFA R) at current levels, and allow for more flexibility within the PEPFAR progr am by continuing to relax specific funding targets for all program areas. Continued accountability, efficiency, and measurement of results should be emphasized. In the future, moreover, PEPFAR should focus on the following key areas: Ensure that national government s assume greater ownership of national HIV/AIDS programs throug h joint planning and decision making, and that they increase dome stic funding to help cover the costs of prevention and treatment. Adapt its delivery platform to become more of a cost-effective, chronic care system that is incorporated into each country's health system and priorities.

Such functions could include the Global Fund's efficient procurement of pro ducts and multipartner efforts to encourage countries to transition to domestic sources of funding. Enhance emphasis on primary preventi on through multisector efforts, including strong interventions agai nst gender-based violence, given that many new HIV infections ar e occurring in adolescent girls. Tuberculosis Unfortunately, TB has not shown the same progress in treatment and prevention as HIV/AIDS and has been a historically unde rfunded disease. In 2015, there were 10.4 million new cases of TB and 1.4 million attributable d eaths (WHO, 2016b). Further complicating efforts to combat this disease is the rapid rise of multidrug-resistant strains of TB (MDR-TB). The current available drug regimens for TB, MDR-TB, and a more severe extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) are lengthy and complex and fr equently have low success rates (WHO, 2016b). Furthermore, treatment for MDR-TB and XDR-TB can cost 100 times as much as treatment for nonresistant TB (Laurence et al ., 2015; Nieburg et al., 2015; Poor an et al., 2013). With few drugs available to treat MDR-TB and XDR-TB and little progress on new treatment options, TB and its drug-resistant strains pose a growing threat to th e health and health security of all countries, including the United States. TB ha s been a priority for the Unite d States since passage of the Foreign Service Act of 1961, and in 2010 the U. S. Agency for International Development (USAID) laid out a sweeping strategy 6 for combating global TB. Of the $4 billion authorized over 5 years to implement this strategy, howev er, only 40 percent was ever appropriated. The U.S. government's underfunding of TB undercuts its capability to reduce the global burden of disease. Accordingly, the U.S. government should r eevaluate its investment in and strategies for combating TB. Recommendation 5: Confront the Threat of Tuberculosis The U.S. Centers for Disease Control a nd Prevention, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and the U.S. Agency for International Development should conduct a thorough global threat assessment of rising tuberculosis (TB) levels, including multidrug-resistant TB and extensively drug-resistant TB. They should then execute a plan of action, including governance structure and priority activiti es, for developing and investing in new diagnostics, drugs, vacci nes, and delivery systems. Malaria Commensurate with the dedicated investment in combating malaria by the global community are tremendous successes in preventing and controlli ng the disease, with an estimated 41 percent reduction in incidence since 2000 and a 62 percen t reduction in mortality rates globally (WHO, 2016d). This progress has been possi ble in large part because of increases in programmatic and financial support\u2014from $100 million in 2000 (WHO, 2013) to $2.9 billion in 2015 (WHO, 2016d;). Through PMI and the Global Fund, which accounted for an estimated 35 percent of global funding for malaria efforts in 2015, the Unite d States has, both dir ectly and indirectly, 6 2010 Lantos Hyde US Global Tuberculosis Strategy. Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 10-9 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS been a major contributor to this success (W HO, 2016d). While the investment in malaria may appear costly, a cost-benefit analysis modeling th e effect of global reduction and elimination of the disease found that the net ga ins in economic output would be worth $208.6 billion (Purdy et al., 2013). As a result of these investments, eliminati on of malaria has become a realistic goal for many countries. Some countries can now declare th emselves malaria-free, a welcome status not only for healthier communities but also for h ealthier economies. Additionally, since 2006, all 15 PMI countries have seen up to 50 percent reductions in child mortality due to malaria infection (USAID, 2014). However, malaria still imposes a major burden of disease, with 212 million cases occurring in 2015 (WHO, 2016d), further imposing a financial burden on families and country economies. Malaria can cost families 25 percent of their income through lost days of work and prevention and treatment costs, and since 2000, average annual costs to sub-Saharan Africa totaled nearly $300 million simply for case management (UNICEF, 2004; WHO, 2015a). Given these high costs to individu als and countries and the threat of drug-resistant strains, a sustained, dedicated focus on malaria should continue. Recommendation 6: Sustain Progre ss toward Malaria Elimination Relevant agencies of the U.S. government should continue their commitment to the fight against malaria through th e President's Malaria Initiative and collaborative work with all partners toward elimination of the disease. ENHANCING PRODUCTIVITY AND ECONOMIC GROWTH The general health and well-being of other countries, including their burden of NCDs such as CVD and cancer, may at first glance not appear to be the top priority of donor countries such as the United States. However, investing in countries' prosperity and stability can result in greater order and predictability in the world, as well as promote U.S. health and prosperity and create more reliable and durable global partners. Premature deat h and disability stemming from NCDs combine to contribute to decreased produ ctivity, decreased gross domestic product, and overall higher costs of health care because exis ting health systems are not designed to care for chronic disease in an integrated and holistic fashion (OECD, 2011). As prevention is always less costly than trea tment, efforts to prevent premature death and disability from NCDs ideally begin at birth and continue across an indivi dual's life course. Cost- effective investments made during a child's early years can mitigate deleterious effects of poverty and social inequality, often resulting in long-lasting gains thr ough adulthood. Healthy behaviors formed during childhood also can have long-term effects. Interventions carried out during the very early years can ev en translate into lifelong benef its in terms of labor market participation, earnings, and econom ic growth, generating returns of up to 25 percent (Gertler et al., 2014). Furthermore, the private sector ha s a clear interest in preventing NCDs as globalization continues to encour age international travel and tr ade. Multinational companies have workforces in many regions of the world and have interests in a productive and capable employee base, which also results in societies that are attractive places to locate their businesses.

Through the launch of the Ending Prev entable Maternal and Child Death initiative, USAID has saved the lives of 46 million children and 200,000 women since 2008 (USAID, 2017). Yet global mortality rates for both mother s and children under 5 are still unacceptably high, with maternal mortality at 216 deaths per 100,000 births and child mo rtality at 41 deaths per 1,000 live births. As a result, each year 5.9 m illion children die before their fifth birthday (WHO, 2016a), and an estimated 303,000 women di e from causes related to pregnancy and childbirth (WHO, 2016c). The majority of these deaths are preventable through interventions whose effectiveness is supported by extremely strong evidence, but challenges remain around how to scale up these interventions. Accelerating investments in cost-effective, evidence-based interventions is critical to sustain the progress ma de thus far and further avoid preventable deaths of infants, children, adolescents, a nd pregnant and l actating women. Recommendation 7: Improve Survival in Women and Children Congress should increase funding for the U.S. Agency for International Development to augment the agency's investments in ending preventable maternal and child mortality, defined as global maternal mortality rates of fewer than 70 deaths per 100,000 live births by 2020 and fewer than 25 child deaths per 1,000 live births by 2030. Inve stments should focus on the most effective interventions and be supported by rigorous monitoring and evaluation. These priority interventions include immunizations; integrated management of child illness; nutrition (pregnant women, newborns, infants, children); prenatal care and safe delivery, incl uding early identification of at- risk pregnancies, safe delivery, and access to emergency obstetrical care; and access to contraceptives and family planning. The committee found that while co ntinued investment in the surv ival agenda is critical, it is only part of the challenge. W ithout proper progress in development in the first 1,000 days of life, many adverse consequences resulting from disease and malnutrition can follow a child through life. Strong neurological evidence demonstrat es long-term mental a nd physical effects of such early risk factors as poor nutrition, lack of nurturing care, and lack of immunizations (Sudfeld et al., 2015). In LMICs, extreme povert y and stunting causes 250 million children (43 percent) younger than 5 fail to reach their deve lopmental potential (Black et al., 2017). Building empowering, nurturing, and c ognitively enriching environments (which include responsive and emotionally supportive parenti ng, opportunities for play and learning, and support for early education) for vulnerable children under 5 and thei r mothers requires an agenda that incorporates the health, education, and social services sectors. Thus, a thrive agenda is an important focal point for investment in addition to the existing survival agenda. Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 10-11 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Recommendation 8: Ensure Healthy and Pr oductive Lives for Women and Children The U.S. Agency for International De velopment, the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, their implementi ng partners, and other funders should support and incorporate proven, cost-effective interventions into their existing programs for ensuring that all children reach th eir developmental potential and become healthy, productive adults. This integration should embrace principles of country ow nership, domestic financing, and community engagement. These intervention s should include the following: Provide adequate nutrition for op timal infant and child cognitive development. Reduce childhood exposure to domestic and other violence. Detect and manage postpartum dep ression and other maternal mental health issues. Support and promote early educatio n and cognitive stimulation in young children. Promoting Cardiovascular Health and Preventing Cancer NCDs such as CVD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and lung cancer kill 40 million people globally each year, almost three- quarters of whom are in LMICs (WHO, 2015b). Of these deaths, 17 million are considered \"prematu re.\" The annual global cost of CVD alone is estimated to rise to more than $1 trillion in 2030 (Reddy et al., 2016). Additionally, more people are dying from cancer in LMICs than from AIDS , TB, and malaria combined, with the total annual cost in 2010 approximated at $1.16 trillion 7\u2014more than 2 percent of total global gross domestic product (Stewart and Wild, 2014). Betw een 30 and 50 percent of cancer deaths are preventable through prevention, early detection, a nd treatment, meaning more than 2.4 million annual deaths are avoidable, and $100-$200 bil lion in global economic savings could be achieved (Stewart and Wild, 2014). Yet many hea lth care systems in these countries are not designed to manage NCDs, and th ey have difficulty integrating various platforms across disease types. The lack of a properly trained workfo rce and of the effectiv e population-level policies described in Chapter 6 is also a challenge for LMICs, and indeed for countries at all income levels. With conditions across the NCD spectrum al so affecting populations in the United States, this is a clear area for shared innovation to tackle common problems. Greater awareness of successful interventions and best practices fo r combating CVD, cancer, and other NCDs can reduce duplication and allow for more rapid information exchange, leading more quickly to solutions. Unfortunately, many efforts to combat NCDs ar e incorporated into other programs as an afterthought, and there is no ove rall coordination mechanism or strategy for a global focus on these diseases. However, U.S. programs have established strong networks and knowledge bases in many countries through decades of global health efforts by various agencies, through such program areas as PEPFAR and maternal and child health efforts. These existing platforms can serve as opportunities in whic h to integrate prevention and treatment efforts for NCDs. 7 This figure is the sum of the costs of prevention an d treatment, plus the annual economic value of disability- adjusted life years (DALYs) lost as a result of cancer. This value fails to estimate longer-term costs to families and the costs that patients and families attribute to human suffering. Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States 10-12 GLOBAL HEALTH AND THE FUTURE ROLE OF THE UNITED STATES PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Additionally, as noted earlier, recent years have s een strong interest from the private sector in addressing the global burden of these diseases because of their clear effects on workforce productivity; however, there is no synergy among priv ate-sector efforts acro ss countries or health systems. The knowledge base acquired by U.S. ag encies and programs should be leveraged and paired with private-sector interest and commun ity-level commitment to mobilize and coordinate high-impact, evidence-based interventions that can be applied in all countries. Absent such concerted efforts, these diseases will continue to result in high rates of premature death and lost productivity, reversing the recent gains in and trends toward improved economic growth and stability in many countries. Recommendation 9: Promote Cardiovas cular Health and Prevent Cancer The U.S. Agency for International Development, the U.S. Department of State, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, through their country offices, should provide seed funding to facilitate the mobilization and involvement of th e private sector in addressing cardiovascular disease and cancer at the country level. These efforts should be closely aligned and coordinated with the efforts of national governments and should strive to integrate services at the community level. The priority strategies to ensure highest impact are Target and manage risk factors (e. g., smoking, alcohol use, obesity) for the major noncommunicable diseases, particularly through the adoption of fiscal policies and regulations that facilitate tobacco control and healthy diets; Detect and treat hypertension early; Detect and treat early cervical cancer; and Immunize for vaccine-preventable cancers (specifically human papilloma virus and hepatitis B vaccines). MAXIMIZING RETURNS ON INVESTMENTS The committee identified opportunities for ch anging the way the United States operates in the arena of global health a nd finances relevant programs to maximize the returns on U.S. investments through improved health outcomes and cost-effectiveness. If the United States can transition from its traditional siloed and reactive approach to global health to a more proactive, systematic, and sustainable approach, the committee believes U.S. investments will have an even more significant positive impact on the four prio rity areas outlined in this report\u2014achieving global health security, maintaining a sustai ned response to the continuous threats of communicable diseases, saving and improving the lives of women and children, and promoting cardiovascular health and preventing cancer. To maximize the returns on investments in these four areas and achieve better health outcomes and more eff ective use of funding, the United States will need to Catalyze innovation through the accelerated development of both medical products and integrated digital health infrastructure; Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 10-13 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Employ more nimble and flexible financing mechanisms to leverage new partners and funders in global health; and Maintain U.S. status and influence as a wo rld leader in global health while adhering to evidence-based science and economi cs, measurement, and accountability. Catalyze Innovation Achieving the improvements in global health called for by numerous previous reports will require changing the way global health busine ss is conducted to better enable innovation. Given the multisectoral nature of health, simply addressing individual challenges in a singular, siloed manner will never solve the overall prob lem. Challenges in the development process for vaccines and drugs to prevent and treat infec tious and neglected diseases have plagued researchers and developers sin ce before HIV/AIDS captured the world's attention in the 1980s. Additionally, health systems in LMICs are typically underresourced and lack basic infrastructure, making it difficult to provide all ty pes of care and public health protections, such as surveillance or access to spec ialty care. Unless researchers, regulators, health providers, and private-sector partners are encouraged to thi nk more creatively to solv e these complex problems and enable changes in current processes, new an d innovative models will be difficult to achieve. The committee believes that th e creation of an environmen t that enables innovation can accelerate the development of critical medical pr oducts and make it possible to augment public health services through technology su ch that they can be provided in a more sustainable manner. Development of Medical Products Global health priorities will be difficult to achieve without safe and effective drugs, vaccines, diagnostics, and devices . The private sector is an e ssential player, together with academia, civil society, and government, in ensuri ng that required products are developed and manufactured. However, the markets for many gl obal health products are uncertain or risky, making it difficult for private-sector developmen t and manufacturing partne rs to justify their shareholders' investments. For example, industry considers investments in innovations to address unpredictable and fast-moving pandemics high-risk, especially given the experience of several firms with investing millions of dollars in the development of vaccines against SARS and Ebola only to find that the government was no longer interested in thes e products (Ebola Vaccine Team B, 2016; Osterholm and Olshaker, 2017). Throug h regulatory or market incentives, the U.S. government can reduce or share the burden of development costs and risks with industry, effectively \"pushing\" a product through the pipe line. Similarly, the U.S. government can reduce market risk (creating market \"pull\") by increasi ng the certainty, speed, or volume of the purchase of products. In the absence of these push and pul l interventions, the Un ited States and other governments risk spending far more than is neces sary to prevent, detect, respond to, and treat disease outbreaks by us ing suboptimal tools. In addition to market forces, human a nd institutional capacity for research and development (R&D) underpins the ability of th e private sector, academia, civil society, and governments to develop priority technologies. This R&D capacity is needed in countries where outbreaks begin and disease burde ns are high. Helping to buil d the capacity for LMICs to conduct clinical trials using thei r own workforces and facilities is both more efficient and more cost-effective than trying to e xport foreign human capacity and tec hnical infrastructure for every disease outbreak. The necessary capacity include s laboratory capacity, the ability to collect Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States 10-14 GLOBAL HEALTH AND THE FUTURE ROLE OF THE UNITED STATES PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS baseline data on disease burden, and an appropriately trained re search-competent workforce. Building this capacity also enables sustaina bility and encourages innovation by creating environments in which local researchers can so lve local problems. The U.S. government has an opportunity to streamline processes, reduce costs, and create more approp riate incentives that will enable industry, academia, and others to contribute to the development of priority innovations for global health. Recommendation 10: Accelerate the Development of Medical Products U.S. government agencies should invest in a targeted effort to reduce the costs and risks of developing, li censing, and introducing vaccines, therapeutics, diagnostics, and devices needed to address global health priorities by enabling innovative appr oaches for trial design, streamlining regulation, ensuring production capaci ty, creating market incentives, and building international capacity for res earch and development. This effort should include the following: Enabling innovative approaches for trial design: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), th e U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) should actively encourage public- and private-sector product development efforts using innovative product development approaches, including platform studies, adaptive trial designs, pragmatic trials, and improved biomarker development. BARDA should assess expa nding its list of priority products for codevelopment with industry, ta king into account global health priorities. Streamlining regulation: FDA should receive adequate resources to improve the tropical disease priority review voucher program and should assess the application of the provisions outlined in the Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now Act to negl ected tropical diseases beyond those on the qualified pathogen list. Ensuring production capacity: BARDA should increase its efforts to promote adequate global manufacturi ng capacity for priority technologies (e.g., Centers for Innovation in Advanced Development and Manufacturing). Creating market incentives: The U.S. government should invest in generating and disseminating accurate and transparent market estimates and should use the purchasing power of U.S. government agencies and global partnerships such as Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, as well as such creative financing mechanisms as volume guaran tees, to reduce market uncertainty for priority health products. Building international capacity for research and development: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, NIH, and DoD should increase the number of people and institutions in partner countries capable of conducting clinical tr ials for global health priorities (e.g., through Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 10-15 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS funding partnerships with academic institutions). This effort should encompass providing support for sustaina ble core capacities such as drug, vaccine, and diagnostic research cap abilities and buildi ng the skills of principal investigators. Development of Integrated Digital Health Infrastructure Digital health efforts have shown promise in reducing costs and promoting health across the United States and the globe. However, many su ch investments have been siloed and short- sighted in their approach, often focusing on sing le diseases or sector s and missing opportunities to develop a sustainable, inte grated platform. Growing mob ile and Internet connectivity worldwide, along with positive disruptive adva nces in the information and communications technology sector, provide a timely opportunity for the United States to reexamine its investment and development approaches to digital health e fforts in other countries . A renewed focus should include goals of reducing frag mentation, improving integration of programs, and maximizing reusability to improve returns on investment s. An emphasis on health systems innovation through technical assistance and public -private partnerships in digita l health can lead to better care and more effective care delivery at lower cost. Given the proliferation of digita l health applications and plat forms in countries across the world, created by public and private sector players alike, there is a need for a common digital health framework that can be applied to different country contexts, allowing for easier replication of best practices and information sharing. At th e country level, cross- cutting digital health platforms should be interoperabl e and yet adaptable to local requirements a nd sovereignty. Such platforms should address each country's health ca re priorities during steady-state times, thereby incentivizing country coinvestment and ownership, while at the same time serving as a resilient system to facilitate controlled sharing of data across countries, thereby enhancing surveillance, coordinated responses, and delivery of services during an emergency. The U.S. government has the opportunity to levera ge government content expertise and private-sector talent to build on recent and ongoing efforts, including legislation8 aimed at improving and integrating efforts to incorporate internet access into education, deve lopment, and economic growth programs. Digital health efforts can be woven into each of t hose sectors with a holis tic and cross-cutting perspective. New and existing U.S. investments should be buttressed by cross-cutting platforms and should assist in making thes e technological advances availabl e to interested countries to improve their own health systems in a manner th at is interoperable and scalable for future- minded solutions. Recommendation 11: Improve Digi tal Health Infrastructure Relevant agencies of the U.S. governme nt should convene an international group of public and private stakeholders to create a common digital health framework that addresses country-level needs ranging from integrated care to research and development. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and the U.S. Department of State should incen tivize and support countries in building interoperable digital health platforms that can efficiently 8 Digital GAP Act of 2017, H.R. 600, 115th Congress.

USAID's Global Development Laboratory should provide technical assistance to countries in the de velopment and implementation of interoperable digital health platforms cofunded by the country and adaptable to local requirements. U.S. agencies should expand upon the \"build-once\" principle of the Digital Global Access Po licy Act and align U.S. funding in digital health by multiple agencies to re duce fragmentation and duplication, as well as maximize the effectivenes s of investments. The provision of this funding should employ method s that reflect smart financing strategies to leverage private i ndustry and country cofinancing (see Recommendation 13). Employ More Nimble and Flexible Financing Mechanisms In the changing landscape of globalization and growth in middle-income countries, traditional aid models are also changing. As a global health leader, the United States should adapt its spending accordingly. Current U.S. gl obal health financing is focused largely on immediate disease-specific prio rities. This financial support is seen as development and humanitarian assistance for stra tegic partner countries. Inst ead, programs should focus on long- term goals of building global health systems a nd platforms that are disease-agnostic and can respond rapidly and flexibly to emerging threat s that potentially imp act the entire world, including the United States. There are innovative mechanisms for making present funds more effective, and opportunities exis t for creative partnerships with new players and investors to develop better programs and goals. Existing pl atforms such as PEPFAR can be augmented through public-private partnerships to improve health outcomes in countries, such as efforts made in the last decade on generic drugs and strengthening of supply chains (Waning et al., 2010). There is also potential in in centivizing the private sector to invest in global health, both for social benefit and for positive long-term business outcomes. Governments can \"crowd-in\" additional funding sources by increasing the dema nd for goods through public funds, and sharing risk in various ways, which then catalyzes priv ate investment that would not have otherwise taken place (Powers and Butterfiel d, 2014). Overall, by conducting more strategic and systematic assessments, the U.S. government can make l ong-term investments in global health that contribute to global public goods rather than short-term expenditures. These long-term investments should maintain a focus on global he alth security; disease prevention and control; cross-cutting health systems i nnovation; and R&D for essential v accines, drugs, diagnostics, and devices. In addition to pursuing more systematic spe nding, the United States needs to consider that many countries continue to grow economica lly, and their needs will change from direct support for the procurement of drugs, diagnosti cs, and other commodities to technical support and sustainable financing from multiple sources. Thinking more strategically about how to help growing middle-income countries transition out of bilateral aid programs and optimize their use of domestic resources in a sustainable way will be an important future role of the United States. Assisting interested countries in structuri ng debt ratios and tax initiatives, along with implementing other innovative mechanisms, can build stronger and more holistic health systems Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 10-17 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS and provide multiple returns on investments. The U.S. government should review the wide variety of mechanisms that have been implem ented by partners around the world as it explores options for expanding and diversifying U.S. global health funding to increase its effectiveness. Recommendation 12: Transition Inves tments Toward Global Public Goods The U.S. Agency for International Development =, the U.S. Department of State, and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services should, together, systematically assess their a pproach to global health funding with an eye toward making long-term investments in high-impact, country-level programs. The focus should be on progr ams that both build national health systems and provide the greatest value in terms of global health security (to prevent pandemics), as well as respond to humanitarian emergencies and provide opportunities for joint research and development for essential drugs, diagnostics, and vaccines that will be nefit many countries, including the United States. Recommendation 13: Optimize Resources Through Smart Financing Relevant agencies of the U.S. gov ernment should expand efforts to complement direct bilateral support fo r health with financing mechanisms that include results-based financing; risk sharing; and attracting funding from private investment, recipient governments, and other donors. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) should structure their financing to prom ote greater country ownership and domestic financing. Assistance shou ld be provided in developing innovative financing products/modalities and in working with the finance sector to push the envelope on innovative sources of financing, crowding in private-sector capital. USAID and PEPFAR should engage with ministries on system design and financing to assist in plan design, model refinement and expansion, return-on-investment analysis, and financial plan execution. USAID should expand the use and flexibility of such mechanisms as the Development Credit Authority, and the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the U.S. Department of State, and USAID should motivate The World Bank; the International Monetary Fund; the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria; and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, respectively, to promote transitioning to domestic financing, assist countries in creating fiscal space for health, leverage fiscal policies to improve health, and attr act alternative financing sources.

Adequately protecting U.S. citizens at home and abroad requires not only investment in U.S. infras tructure, but also continued awareness of global issues and ac tive engagement in the internati onal global health arena. There have been continuing calls for management a nd operational reforms of WHO, and while the committee agrees on the need for reform, it also recognizes that WHO pe rforms many essential functions\u2014for example, setting su ch standards as International Health Regulations. In addition, many other UN agencies and international organizatio ns and partnerships formed in the last few decades are crucial in providing support to c ountries around the world. The success of all of these multilateral entities, such as the Global Fund, will help the U.S. government accomplish its global health goals and maximize its returns on investments. Many of the events and elements of the ch anging global health landscape described throughout this report have crea ted an environment for a centralized and comprehensive strategy for U.S. global health diplomacy. The United States has an opportunity to solidify its leadership and take a more deliberate foreign policy approa ch, including the creation of a system to support a more sustainable global health workforce in the United States. The limited number of noncareer health appointments cu rrently available abroad are ad hoc and do not facilitate institutional knowledge or a promising career track for health professionals. Also needed is better bidirectional communication betw een health and diplomacy prof essionals and increased cross- disciplinary training. Greater flex ibility for U.S. health professionals to work abroad, with emphasis on country and cultural competence and understanding, can allow for better sharing of information and more coordinated response during an outbreak or other em ergency. It also could enable long-term partnerships focused on develo ping cures for such diseases as HIV/AIDS and cancer. Strengthening relations with countries through a strong, centralized office of global health diplomacy can create a coordinating health role for U.S. embassies while also improving situational awareness and networki ng with other sectors connected to health, such as finance and energy. Recommendation 14: Commit to Cont inued Global Health Leadership To protect itself from global threats , benefit from successes achieved in global health programs, and maintain a strong research and development pipeline, the United States should commit to mainta ining its leadership in global health and actively particip ating in global health governance, coordination, and collaboration. To this end, the U.S. Department of State and the U.S. Department of Health a nd Human Services (HHS) should do the following: Use their influence to improve the performance of key United Nations agencies and other international organizations important to global health, particularly the World Health Organi zation (WHO). WHO is in need of greater resources to address the health challenges of the 21st century, and many of its priorities align with thos e of the U.S. government. However, U.S. government financial contributions to WHO should come with a requirement Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 10-19 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS that the organization adopt and implement the much-needed management and operational reforms iden tified in recent reports. Remain involved in and firmly committe d to innovative global partnerships that further U.S. global health goals, su ch as the highly successful Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, as well as promising new entities such as the Globa l Health Security Agenda and the Global Financing Facility. Implement a more strategic approach to achieving global health goals. This new approach should include the commitment of the Department of State tocreating a global health career track and congressional action to enable the establishment of a cadre of global he alth experts within HHS through an amendment to the Foreign Service Act. This would create the environment necessary to expand the health attach\u00e9 program, particularly in middle-income countries.

The recommendations made in the 1997 Institute of Medicine (IOM) report clustered around three broa d ways that the United States would benefit from entering the global health arena\u2014protecting the American people, enhancing the American economy, and advancing American international interest s. These themes are presented in the report under th e guiding principle that the Unit ed States should assume a global health leadership role and lead from its strengths, particularly in the areas of medical science and technology. Within the theme of \"protecting our peopl e\" are recommendations in the areas of health surveillance , information sharing , research , and collaboration . The board advised the U.S. government, in partnership with the corporate sect or, to facilitate the development of a global network to carry out biomedical surveillance for existing and emerging infectious diseases and to serve as an early warning system for global heal th threats, such as potential attacks with chemical or biological agents. Th is network was to be bolstered by efforts to more broadly share information among countries about efficient and equitable health care financing and delivery, to invest in further international collaborative hea lth research and new product development, and to conduct research about the prevention of violence. To enhance the U.S. economy, the committ ee recommended that the U.S. government incentivize biopharmaceutical industries to rese arch and develop products aimed primarily at populations in low- and middl e-income countries (LMICs),2 with a view to strengthen the U.S. industry and improve the population health a nd economic prosperity of other countries. 1 Programs and organizations launched include: M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res' Campaign for Access to Essential Medicines (1999); World Health Organization's Global Ou tbreak Alert and Response Network (2000); the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (2000); Stop Tuberculosis Partnership (now housed by UNOPS) (2000); Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance (2000); the United Nations' Millennium Development Goals (2000); and the Glob al Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria (2002). 2 Suggested incentives include allowing multitiered pricing of drugs and vaccines, protecting intellectual property rights, extending patents to encourage product development, and creating public-private partnerships to develop essential products for poor populations.

All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States A-2 GLOBAL HEALTH AND THE FUTURE ROLE OF THE UNITED STATES PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Furthermore, the committee advised the United States to broaden the scope of its investments in global health research and development towa rd preventing and controlling the greatest international health burdens and threats: infectious diseases, noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), substance abuse, injuries, and violence. To advance the international interests of the United States, the committee advised the U.S. government to parlay partnerships and co st sharing with intern ational governments and donors into increased investment in biomedical research and development linked to global health. To build health workforce capacity, the repor t called for continued long-term federal investment to build on the U.S. strength in edu cating and training health providers, researchers, and policy makers toward establishing a sound global health infrastructure for preventing, detecting, and treating disease and other public health th reats of internationa l scope. In the areas of global leadership and the U.S. global hea lth strategy, the committee recommended creating a governmental Interagency Task Force on Global H ealth to anticipate global health needs and coordinate responses, with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) taking a lead role in strategizi ng, setting priorities, and liaising am ong agencies and with other sectors (academia, nongovernmental organizations [NGOs], i ndustries, and international agencies). The report also directed the government to expand it s sphere of internationa l influence by paying its dues to the United Nations (UN) system and prom oting the system's reform, as well as forming international, multisectoral, and multilateral health-focused partnerships to drive research, leverage expertise, and ca pitalize on limited resources. THE U.S. COMMITMENT TO GLOBAL HEALTH (2009) The Committee on U.S. Commitment to Global Health in 2009 noted that in the years since the 1997 IOM report discu ssed above, the United States vita l self-interest in promoting global health and health security had been bor ne out and even height ened in the wake of burgeoning globalization and urbaniza tion and cross-border health th reats of infec tious disease (such as the 2009 H1N1 influenza epidemic), as well as unhealthy consumer goods and the high prevalence of modifiable risk factors that are linked to chronic diseases and most premature deaths worldwide. The committee expanded upon the definition of globa l health in the 1997 report by appending the \"goal of improving health for all people by reducing avoidable disease, disabilities, and deaths\" (IOM, 2009). The report's recommendations concentrate on ways the United States can lead by example in internationa l collaborative efforts to develop, finance, and deliver essential, cost-effective health interventi ons to improve health on a worldwide scale, but with a particular focus on LMICs. The recomm endations fall into four categories: increasing U.S. financial commitments to global health; s caling up existing health interventions; partnering to invest in people, instituti ons, and capacity building; and shar ing knowledge to address health problems in LMICs. The interim period between th e two reports saw a marked increase in both the funding and priority afforded to global health, despit e the relatively low level of overall overseas development assistance extended by the United States compared with other high-income countries. The committee urged the U.S. govern ment to meet existing international aid commitments by investing $15 billio n annually in global health by 2012,3 with $13 billion of that 3 This would double U.S. annual commitments to global health between 2008 ($7.51 billion) and 2012.

All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States APPENDIX A: PAST IOM REPORTS ON GLOBAL HEALTH A-3 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS directed to the health-related Millennium Development Goals and $2 billion toward NCDs and injuries. Related recommendations include desi gning a coordinated funding approach for global health research that leverages the HHS budget fo r research subsidies and the foreign affairs budget for innovative funding mechanisms to proc ure drugs and diagnosti cs; prioritizing donor aid; and providing support for developing s ound country-led national health plans with appropriate monitoring, ev aluation, and review. To improve coordination across the U.S. government, the committee recommended creating a White House Interagency Committee on Global Health, chaired by a senior official designated by the president, to be tasked with leading, plannin g, prioritizing, and coordinating the budgeting for major U.S. government global health programs and activities. This was done through the launch of the Global H ealth Initiative (GH I) in 2009 by President Obama. However, with an initiative spanning so many agencies an d health areas, its success depended on strong authority and budget given to the GHI organizers . Unfortunately, they received neither, and GHI had little more than a web presence coordina ting priority area global health programs. To achieve significant health gains by scaling up existing interventions, the committee recommended that the U.S. public and private sect or lead through global pa rtnerships to prepare for the emerging health challenges of the 21st ce ntury (e.g., infectious pandemic threats, NCDs, climate change, globalization, and urbanization), and to strengthen neglec ted health systems by leveraging disease-specific programs. The U.S. government's global health programs and other health organizations operating in low-income c ountries were advised to focus on strengthening and supporting national hea lth systems by aligning sustained assistance with the priorities of each national health sector's human resource plans. To generate and share knowledge about how to most effectively address the health problems that disproportionately affect LMIC s, the committee recommended that the U.S. research sector collaborate with global partners to leverage its scientific and technical capabilities to study the basic m echanisms of those diseases, to examine new interventions for infectious diseases, to reduce h ealth system bottlenecks, and to rigorously evaluate programmatic efforts. To empower researchers in LMICs to improve their populations' health, the report advised establishing global networks to diss eminate and expedite sharing knowledge through improved access to scientific publications (e.g., in public digital libraries), research data, materials, and patented interventions. To promote institutional capacity building, th e U.S. government and private sector were advised to foster long-term r eciprocally beneficial global pa rtnerships with institutions (academia, research institutes, and health system s) in LMICs to further enable and financially support local problem solving and policy making. 4 At the time of the report the health workforce predicament in LMICs was of crisis proporti ons; thus, the committee recommended exploring opportunities to support country-l ed health-sector workforce plans and explore potential opportunities to leverage the U.S. workforce (e.g., through a global he alth service corps). The committee made several recommendations about how the United States could set the example of engaging in respectful partnerships and assume the ro le of international leader in global health. The committee advised that enab ling countries to maintain ownership and accountability for their populations' health, as well as ensuring long-term sustainability, will require donors to support local capacity building and the deve lopment of outcome-oriented 4 Specifically, by investing in training, creating an enabling institutional environment, funding a steady stream of diverse research grants, generating demand for scientific and analytical work that influences public policy, and contributing to the control of real and immediate health problems.

To that end, funding support should be proportionately greater for technically and financially sound country-led health plans coupled with transp arent, agreed-upon implementation strategies. The report advised the U.S. government to act as a global health lead er by paying its fair share of the World Health Organization (WHO) budget and providing t echnical expertise to WHO as needed, but it also called for requesti ng a rigorous external re view of WHO aimed at maximizing its effectiveness. The U.S. president was urged to highlight health as a pillar of U.S. foreign policy, given that acting in the global interest with prioritie s based upon effectively attaining sustained health gains (rather than short-term strategic or tactical domestic benefits) will reap longer-term economic, diplomatic, and security rewards. 5 KEY AREAS OF RECOMMENDATION AND ADVANCEMENTS TO DATE Despite the change in the global health la ndscape between the two IOM reports, certain key areas of recommendation remained consis tent: sharing information, health research collaboration, health workforce capacity, U.S. gl obal health strategy, and the role of the United States as a global leader in th is domain. The 1997 report made recommendations in the areas of surveillance, medical research and development, and violence research that were not prominent in the 2009 report, while the latte r report provided explicit reco mmendations in the areas of institutional capacity building as well as financing and donor goals. Progress to date toward in each of those 10 areas is su mmarized in this section. In the area of information sharing, globa l knowledge networks have been supported across sectors through WHO, the World Bank, academic research centers, and NGOs. Other efforts to cooperatively and innovatively a ddress complex global development challenges include the Global Knowledge Initiative (2009) and the U.S. Agency for International Development's (USAID's) Higher Ed ucation Solutions Network (2012),6 although the latter is focused more generally on development. Progress in health research collaboration includes the Partnerships for Enhanced Engagement in Research (2011), a competitive program that offers awards to scientists from LMICs (and partners th em with U.S. government-funded rese archers) to support research and capacity building; the program is administered by USAID but leverages funding across the U.S. government (USAID, 2016). Other USAID efforts include its Evaluation Policy (2011) (USAID, 2011) as well as the Global Development Lab (2014), which aims to strengthen the evidence base and leverage science and technology to improve development results, with a focus on ending extreme poverty by 2030 (USAID, 2017). Th e National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases funded eight tropical research me dicine centers in 2012 to support research on neglected tropical diseases in endemic areas. 5 The committee also suggested that the U.S. president convene world lead ers for a summit meeting at the UN General Assembly General Debate and the 2009 G20 meeting to announce the commitment to the overall global health funding recommended in the report ($15 billion per annum) as well as highlighting the importance of improving food and water security. 6 The Global Knowledge Initiative is an NGO that seeks to surmount globa l development challenges through collaborative innovation and knowledge sharing by connecting innovative stakeholders with resources, expertise, and financing.

All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States APPENDIX A: PAST IOM REPORTS ON GLOBAL HEALTH A-5 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Progress in health workforce capacity is evident on multiple fronts. The Medical Education Partnership Initiativ e was launched in 2010 by the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), the Health Resources and Services Administration, and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to a ddress the severe shortage of skill ed health workers, despite the resources mobilized by PEPFAR and others.7 The Nursing Education Partnership Initiative (PEPFAR, n.d.) also supports PEPFAR by aimi ng to train at least 140,000 new health care professionals and paraprofessiona ls in the partner countries of Lesotho, Malawi, Zambia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Ethiopia. Ho wever, these programs concluded in 2015, and thus far have not been renewed. The U.S. Cent ers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)'s Division of Global Health Protection has delive red field epidemiology training programs since 1980 (currently in 70 countries) (CDC, 2016a), as well as a new initiative called Improving Public Health Management for Action (CDC, 2016c ), which trains public health managers. The Global Health Service Partnershi p, established in 2012, is a public-private partnership between Seed Global Health, the Peace Corps, PEPFAR, a nd the Global Health Service Corps to send doctors and nurses to LMICs faci ng healthcare provider shortage s as medical educators (Peace Corps, n.d.; Seed Global Health, 2017). Efforts related to the U.S. global health st rategy include the GHI (2008), a presidential initiative that was launched with great fanfare, but did not receive anticipated funding, attributable at least in part to a lack of clear leadership or hi erarchy. The Global Health Security Agenda (2014) (GHSA, n.d.) is a pa rtnership that seeks to build c ountry-level capacity to address the threat of infectious disease and maintain global health secur ity through implementation of the International Health Regulations (2005). Currently, the Presiden t's National Security Council serves the coordinating role in calling for inte ragency policy committees as needed for specific topics or initiatives. Progress toward the United States assuming a global leadership role as requested through multilateral engagement in health is less apparent . As of 2015, the United States was assessed at 28 percent of the UN peacekeeping budget and 22 percent of the regular budget (UN, 2016, 2017), and 22 percent of the overall WHO budge t (WHO, 2015). However, a significant proportion of this funding still is unpaid (W HO, 2017). The 2009 G20 meeting included food security but not water; howe ver, at the 2009 G8 summit Pres ident Obama announced plans for increased investment in global food security.8 In surveillance, a focus of the 1997 repor t's recommendations, progress at the global level includes the Inte rnational Health Regulat ions (established in 2005) and the CDC Country Partnerships for Integrated Disease Surveilla nce and Response Implementation, which seeks to make surveillance and laboratory data more usab le by public health managers and other decision makers in improving detection and response to health problems in African countries (CDC, 2017). The Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (WHO, n.d.) (2000) is a collaboration to guide technical expertise on the ground during disease outbreak s that pose an international threat.9 7 By increasing the numbers and improving the quality of graduates, promoting retentio n of graduates where they are most needed, improving capacity for regionally rele vant research, building communities of practice within Africa and globally, and ensuring sustainability (NIH, 2017). 8 For example, Feed the Future (2012 ), is a whole-of-government approach led by USAID to address extreme poverty, undernutrition, and hunger. See more at https://www.feedthefuture.gov/about (accessed April 17, 2017). 9 In addition to these sources of surve illance data, there are informal sources, including the International Society for Infectious Diseases-Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases (ISID, 2014), the Global Public Health Intelligence Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States A-6 GLOBAL HEALTH AND THE FUTURE ROLE OF THE UNITED STATES PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS The 2016 National Academy of Medicine report The Neglected Dimension of Global Security recommended that WHO should generate a high-priority \"wat ch list\" of outbreaks to be released to national focal point s on a daily basis and on a weekly basis to the public. However, the commission noted that reporting by counties will need to be incentivized by International Health Regulations toward a broader aim of fo stering transparency in information sharing (NAM, 2016). At the national level, Homeland Security Presidential Directive 10 (2004) addresses biodefense for the 21s t century (Bush, 2004). However, according to a 2016 Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense, the DHS National Biosurveillance Integr ation Center (DHS, 2016) has been unable to meet its mandate of \"i ntegrating and analyzing data relating to human health, animal, plant, food, and environmental monitoring systems\" (Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense, 2015). Thus, while much progress ha s been made since 1997 in surveillance at national and global levels, the 2009 H1N1 outbr eak and the 2014-2015 Ebola outbreak illustrate that there is still a long way to go before countries are able to ra pidly detect and report disease outbreak. In the area of medical research and devel opment, another focus of the 1997 report, the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Prepared ness and Response established the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority in 2006 through the Pand emic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act,10 which incentivizes cost sharing thr ough Centers of Innovation for Advanced Development and Manufacturing partnerships be tween the U.S. government and the private sector for collaboration, development, cost sh aring, and ensuring surge capacity for vaccine manufacturing (ASPR, 2007). The U.S. Food a nd Drug Administration' s (FDA's) Priority Review Voucher program (2007) spurs developm ent by allowing for expedited FDA review of certain types of new drugs (i.e. neglected diseas es, medical countermeasures, and rare pediatric diseases), which can translate into millions in do llars of profits (Gaffney et al., 2016). The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office's Patents for Huma nity program awards patents to innovators striving to address global human itarian challenges (USPTO, 2016). In addition to these programs, the U.S. supports key public-pr ivate partnerships\u2014product development partnerships\u2014that are instrumental in incenti vizing the innovation of diagnostics drugs that target poverty related diseases. To advance violence research as recomme nded in the 1997 report, the State Department and USAID have funded sexual- and gender-based violence prev ention and response projects (2012).11 CDC, the United Nations Population Fund, and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees have conducted populati on-based studies in Libe ria, East Timor, and Uganda to examine violence against women, an d NIH has funded research grants addressing partner violence in the cont ext of human immunodeficienc y virus (HIV) programming. Institutional capacity building, as well as donor goals and financing, were areas of recommendation for the 2009 IOM report. To the former, the CDC Global Disease Detection Program works in 50 countries through 10 centers to develop six core capacities12 formulated to achieve compliance with Intern ational Health Regulations (CDC, 2016b). The Health Systems Network via Health Canada (Government of Canada, 2016), the CDC Global Disease Detection Operations Center (CDC, 2016b), and HealthMap (HealthMap, n.d.). 10 H.R. 307, 113th Congress. 11 Pursuant to Section 7061 of the Conference Report accompanying the U. S. Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2012 (Div. I, P.L. 112-74). 12 Core capacities: emerging infectious disease detection and response; training in field epidemiology and laboratory methods; pandemic influenza preparedness and response; zoonotic disease investigation and control; health communication and information technology; laboratory systems and biosafety. Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Global Health and the Future Role of the United States APPENDIX A: PAST IOM REPORTS ON GLOBAL HEALTH UNCORRECTED PROOFS 20/20 Project (2008-2012) was USAID' s global health flagship pr oject designed to strengthen health systems though integrative approaches to addressing financ ing, governance, operational, and capacity-system constraint s (USAID, 2013). The USAID Colla borative Support for Health program in Liberia seeks to strengthen the hea lth system's resilience in emergency contexts (MSH, 2017). With respect to donor goals and financing, funding did increase slightly after 2008 but not to the extent recommended in the IOM report; it hovered around $9 billion annually from 2009 to 2016 (Salaam-Blyther, 2013).13 There has been an ideol ogical shift toward country ownership reflected in the change in terminology from aid to partnership and a new emphasis on government-to-government funding, which will become clear in the 2017 committee report recommendations as well.
