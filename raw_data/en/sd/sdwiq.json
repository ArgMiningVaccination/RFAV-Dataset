If you can't tell from my photo, I've got a big smile on my face. This is maybe the first time in my life I was so happy to get a shot (note: my only side effect was a sore arm the next day). I am lucky enough to live in a county (Siskiyou in far northern California) that included ALL Forest Service employees in a priority group to be vaccinated. I try not to play favorites, but I've got to add that last week, as I rendezvoused with local colleagues to get our second dose, I learned that about 220 of the 275 employees of the Klamath National Forest have been vaccinated. The mighty Klamath crushing herd immunity. Nice work. After a month, I was able to get my second dose Thursday, Feb. 4. How did I feel after the second dose? Well, about 18 hours after receiving it, a mild headache and some lower back pain set in. A couple of hours of chills gave me a good excuse to wrap up on the couch and watch television. It may be an odd thing to say, but I was glad to feel less-than-great because it meant my immune system was doing its job. As the wonderful nurse who cared for us on dose two said, \"feeling crummy is not a bad thing.\" So, Thursday afternoon vaccination, Friday mid-morning feeling crummy that lasted the rest of the day (advice: take a little Tylenol after the shot if you can) and Saturday, waking up and feeling normal. Not too tough on side-effects, and the added bonus of getting caught up on Netflix. From my non-statistical survey of colleagues across the country, I know that vaccine roll-out has been uneven and that rural areas seem to have better access to vaccines. I have great sympathy for those wanting to be vaccinated and unable to do so currently. All I can say is hang in there, keep following good mitigation practices and your turn will come! It is no surprise that our Forest Service community reflects the full spectrum of opinions around COVID19 vaccination. I acknowledge and respect everyone's personal choices in this matter. I also know that we live in a time when it's often very hard to parse out the good information from the constant influx of data that comes our way. I encourage everyone to rely on trusted, science-based resources to help inform decisions. A good source to check out is the [Centers for Disease Control website](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/index.html). My science-trained background plus consideration of CDC materials led me to being confident in the safety and effectiveness of vaccination. In making my decision, I also thought of people in my life that I would be protecting and supporting with my vaccination: my 89-year-old mom, an immuno-compromised sister and my personal hero, my nurse niece, who's spent the last 10 months on the front lines of the COVID wards in Seattle. The benefit of vaccination to me, my family, my community and my country was a deep motivation for me. My decision also strongly resounds with the values of the Forest Service: service, interdependence and safety. I wish you and your families the best in making the decision that is right for you.
