Jay Bhattacharya and R. Scott French. Dr. Jay Bhattacharya is a Professor of Health Pol- icy at Stanford University School of Medicine, a re- search associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research, and the Director of Stanford's Center for Demography and Economics of Health and Aging. Holding an M.D. and a Ph.D. from Stanford, Dr. Bhattacharya has dedicated his professional career to the analysis of health policy, including infectious dis- ease epidemiology and the safe ty and efficacy of medi- cal interventions. He has published 155 scholarly articles in peer-reviewed journals in the fields of med- icine, economics, health policy, epidemiology, statistics, law, and public health. His research has been cited in the peer-reviewed scientific literature more than 12,400 times. Dr. Bhattacharya has studied exten-sively and commented publicly on Covid-19 (\"Covid\") health policy in the United States and around the world, including vaccination requirements. He is a pri-mary coauthor of the Great Barrington Declaration, which criticizes Covid lockdowns and other draconian policy measures and calls for focused protection aimed 1 Consistent with Rule 37.6, no counsel for a party authored this brief in whole or in part, and no person other than amici or its counsel made a monetary contribution to its preparation or submission. The parties' counsel of record received timely notice of the intent to file this amicus curiae brief pursuant to S. Ct. R. 37.2(a). Petitioners and Respondents granted consent to the filing of this brief. 2 at protecting the vulnerable and high-risk. More than 60,000 epidemiologists and other medical profession- als have co-signed the Declaration. See Great Bar- rington Declaration, http s://gbdeclaration.org/. Dr. Bhattacharya's recent essays on public health policy have appeared in the Wall Street Journal , Bari Weiss's Common Sense , and Newsweek . Dr. R. Scott French is a board-certified emergency medicine physician, with an active practice treating and managing Covid patients in California, Hawaii and several other states. Beginning in 2020, Dr. French oversaw Covid transmission mitigation measures for patients and staff in four California emergency depart- ments and managed Covid prevention and treatment protocols for communities and clinics in Hawaii, Texas, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Georgia, and North Carolina. Prior to that, Dr. French was Chief Medical Officer of a large health plan in California with over a million members, and responsible for disease and population management. Since that time, Dr. French has served as Regional Medical Director for two separate large na-tional medical groups, where he was involved in man- aging emergency departments, hospitalists, urgent care clinics, and medical c linics in several states. Dr. French graduated from Harbor-UCLA Emergency Medicine Residency and went to work as full-time teaching faculty at Stanford University Medical School and later University of North Carolina Medical School. Dr. French continued to hold part-time clinical faculty teaching appointments at the University of Washing-ton, Oregon Health Systems University, and Emory 3 University, among other institutions. He has taught medical students, interns, and residents on population and disease management, including viral pathogens. His teaching presentations included prevention, reduc-ing the spread of viral pathogens, principles of immu- nology, diagnosis, and treatment. Drs. Bhattacharya and French see evidence across the country that policymakers' responses to the Covid pandemic have not followed up-to-date, peer-reviewed science or best practices, and have instead become un- duly politicized. The result is health policies\u2014like New York's vaccine mandate for healthcare workers\u2014that are deeply misguided, scientifically unsupportable, and devastating for short- and long-term public health. The consequences have been tragic: job losses and se-vere economic disruptions, educational delays and set- backs for kids and college students, deteriorating mental and physical health, and unprecedented spikes in suicide, drug overdoses, and other deaths from des- pair, to name just a few. Worse, it is poor and working- class people, as well as racial and ethnic minorities, that have borne the brunt of bad pandemic policies, which are driven more by elite panic than science. This Court can serve as a rational corrective, reminding government leaders and public health officials that pandemics don't suspend the Constitution and that reasoned decisionmaking grounded in facts is critical to maintaining the public's trust in this area. --------------------------------- --------------------------------- 4 SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT This Court should grant the writ and reverse the Second Circuit's decision because Employment Divi- sion v. Smith continues to cause confusion in the lower courts and work injustice fo r people of sincere faith. Review is especially warranted in a case like this, where public officials have altogether skipped the dem- ocratic process and burdened free exercise under the guise of bureaucratic expertise. Cf. Employment Divi- sion v. Smith , 494 U.S. 872, 890 (1990) (reasoning that \"legislation \" is entitled to deferential review because the democratic process \"can be expected to be solici- tous\" of free exercise (emphasis added)). Amici here are scientists and physicians who spe- cialize in virology and infectious disease, with particu- lar expertise in health policy and practice related to Covid-19. We write to explain to the Court why New York's vaccine mandate does not stand up to serious scientific scrutiny. Like all such mandates, this one is premised on the notion that the Covid vaccines \"stop the spread\" of the virus. But they do not. Neither these vaccines nor vaccine mandates have substantially halted the transmission of Covid, a fact made abun-dantly clear with the rise of the Omicron variant, which has spread rapidly among heavily vaccinated populations and caused waves of so-called break-through infections. The rationality of New York's man- date is further undercut by its refusal to recognize natural immunity, which data show to be equivalent, if not superior, to vaccination in protecting against infec- tion. 5 While the Covid vaccines do appear to lower an in- dividual's odds of severe disease and death, reducing severity as opposed to transmission confers a largely private benefit, not a public one. The vaccines' primary impact is thus individual rather than societal. Ordi- narily in American medicine, an intervention of this sort is a matter of personal choice, informed by consul-tation with one's physician and other professionals, where benefits, risks, and preferences can be individu- ally assessed and weighed. To override personal deci-sionmaking through a medical mandate, government should be required to show, at the very least, solid evi- dence of public need. As this brief lays out, no such ev- idence justifies New York's Covid vaccine mandate. --------------------------------- --------------------------------- ARGUMENT I. Covid vaccine mandates don't rationally advance the government's interest in stop- ping transmission\u2014bec ause the vaccines don't stop transmission. Covid vaccine mandates rest upon an empirical claim\u2014that the vaccines stop transmission of the vi-rus. As the World Health Organization correctly ob- serves, such mandates are justified only if there is \"sufficient evidence that th e vaccine is efficacious in preventing serious infection and/or transmission.\" 2 2 World Health Org., COVID-19 and mandatory vaccination: Ethical considerations and caveats , Policy Br. (Apr. 13, 2021), https://bit.ly/3MM5KKn. 6 Among pundits and politicians , this has become an ar- ticle of faith. \"[T]he virus stops with every vaccinated person,\" MSNBC's Rachel Maddow told viewers last March.3 \"You're not going to\u2014you're not going to get COVID if you have these vaccinations,\" President Biden echoed in a CNN town hall in July 2021.4 New York's vaccine mandate is premised on the same ra- tionale. As the governor's office put it when the man- date was announced, \"We must act now to stop the spread. . . . This mandate will . . . reduce the spread of the Delta variant.\" 5 But the science doesn't support these assertions, and New York's rationale doesn't stand up to serious scrutiny. There is no evidence that the vaccines or vac- cine mandates can substant ially halt transmission of the virus. Particularly since the rise of the Omicron variant, this fact has become abundantly obvious, as heavily vaccinated countries have faced large waves of Covid cases, and many vaccinated individuals have ex- perienced breakthrough infections. 3 See Rachel Maddow Show, Mar. 29, 2021, https://youtu.be/ 2e-_1HQb7LA (clip provided by third party). 4 The White House, Remarks by President Biden in a CNN Town Hall with Don Lemon (July 21, 2021), https://bit.ly/ 3tTpPpp. 5 N.Y.

Covid vaccines of fer near-zero protec- tion against transmission, particularly of the now-dominant Omicron variant. Even before Omicron, there was mounting evi- dence that vaccines weren't st opping the spread of the Delta variant. On August 5, 2021\u2014mere days before New York rolled out its mandate\u2014CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky admitted in a CNN interview that \"what [the vaccines] can't do anymore is prevent trans- mission.\" 6 That alone should have made New York pol- icymakers hit the pause button. Subsequent studies on Delta infections among the vaccinated only confirmed Dr. Walensky's admission. A longitudinal study from the UK found that vaccinated individuals infected with Delta \"have peak viral load similar to unvaccinated cases and can efficiently trans-mit infection in household settings, including to fully vaccinated contacts.\" 7 A study of vaccinated healthcare 6 Madeline Holcombe & Christina Maxouris, \"Fully vac- cinated people who get a Covid-19 breakthrough infection can transmit the virus, CDC chief says,\" CNN (Aug. 6, 2021), https:// cnn.it/3vZTVdt. 7 Anika Singanayagam et al., load kinetics of the SARS-C oV-2 delta (B.1.617.2) variant in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals in the UK: a prospec-tive, longitudinal, cohort study,\" The Lancet Infectious Diseases , vol. 22(2), pp.183-95 (Feb. 1, 2022), https://bit.ly/3i6cV1W; see also for Disease Control & Prevention, \"Outbreak of SARS- CoV-2 Infections, Including COVID-19 Vaccine Breakthrough Infections, Associated with Large Public Gatherings\u2014Barnsta-ble County, Massachusetts, July 2021,\" Morbidity & Mortality Weekly Rpt.

The authors concluded that vaccination was \"associated with high viral loads,\" and the \"data sug- gested ongoing transmission had occurred between fully vaccinated individuals.\" 9 As of January 1, 2022, Omicron was the dominant variant in the United States. Today it represents 100% of U.S. Covid cases.10 If Delta cast doubt on the notion that vaccines prevent transmission, Omicron totally eviscerated it. The CDC concedes that \"anyone with Omicron infection can spread the virus to others, even if they are vaccinated .\" 11 Pfizer and Moderna made sim- ilar admissions in press releases late last year\u2014yet load of vaccinated and unvaccinated persons infected with SARS- CoV-2 is . . et al., \"An observational study of breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant infections among vac-cinated healthcare workers in Vietnam,\" eClinicalMedicine , vol. 41 (Nov. 2021), https://bit.ly/3w8U3rr. 9 Ibid. 10 See Ctrs. for Disease Control & Prevention, COVID Data Tracker, https://covid.cdc.gov/covid -data-tracker/#var iant-proportions (accessed March 13, 2022). 11 Ctrs. for Disease Control & Prevention, \"Omicron Variant: What You Need to Know,\" updated Feb. 2, 2022, https://www. cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/omicron-variant.html (emphasis added). 9 still managed to pitch the benefits of seemingly limit- less \"boosting.\"12 Real-world evidence from four countries with sig- nificant experience with Omicron\u2014Denmark, the UK, Germany, and Canada (all of which provide more de- tailed and transparent data than is available in the United States)\u2014shows that the vaccines have substan- tially zero efficacy at preventing Omicron transmis- sion, undermining the central rationale for New York's (or any) vaccine mandate. The Statens Serum Institut in Copenhagen, Den- mark analyzed Danish data and found vaccine efficacy turned negative 91 days after administration of the second dose. 13 In other words, vaccinated Danes were even more likely than unvaccinated Danes to be in- fected with Omicron after three months. This may be because unvaccinated, Covid-recovered patients have better protection against Omicron compared to vac- cinated individuals with no prior infection\u2014pointing 12 See Pfizer, \"Pfizer and BioNTech Provide Update on Variant,\" Press 8, 2021), https://bit.ly/ 37gPKzE (\"two doses of BNT162b2 may not be sufficient to pro-tect against infection with th e Omicron variant\"); Moderna, \"Moderna Announces Preliminar y Booster Data and Updates Strategy to Address Omicron Variant,\" Press Release (Dec. 20, 2021) (\"All groups had neutra lizing antibody levels in Omicron PsVNT assay prior to boosting.\"). 13 Christian Holm Hansen et al., \"Vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infection with the Omicron or Delta variants following a two-dose or booster mRNA-1273 study,\" 23, 2021), https://bit.ly/3I2mA4d. 10 to both the inefficacy of the vaccines and the superior- ity of natural immunity. See infra , Part II. In Germany, the most recent detailed report from the Robert Koch Institute\u2014the German equivalent of the CDC\u2014found that as of December 31, 2021, 78.6 percent (4,020 of 5,117) of sequenced Omicron cases were in vaccinated Germans, 14 despite a population vaccination rate at the time of less than 71 percent.15 These data suggest that Omicron is indifferent to vac-cination status. In December 2021, the UK Health Security Agency calculated preliminary estimates of vaccine ef- fectiveness remarkably similar to the Danish study, with near-zero efficacy for both Pfizer and Moderna vaccines 20 weeks after the second dose. 16 These find- ings accord with an Imperial College of London study that estimated vaccine effectiveness against sympto-matic Omicron infection to be \"between 0% and 20% after two doses, and between 55% and 80% after a 14 Robert Koch Institute, W\u00f6chentlicher Lagebericht des RKI zur Coronavirus-Kran kheit-2019 (COVID-19) (Dec. 30, 2021), https://bit.ly/3pXQu3e. 15 World in Data, Coronavirus (COVID-19) Vaccina- tions, https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations; see also Edou- ard Mathieu et al., \"A global database of COVID-19 vaccinations,\" Nature Human Behavior , vol. 5, pp.947-53 (July 2021) (describ- ing the foregoing dataset). 16 UK Health Security Agency, \"SARS-CoV-2 variants of con- cern and variants under investigation in England,\" Technical briefing 33 (Dec. 23, 2021), at 26-27, https://bit.ly/3i21Dvy. 11 booster dose.\"17 Twenty percent represents no effective protection. The UK Health Security Agency's weekly \"COVID- 19 vaccine surveillance reports\" also show that the vac- cines have not reduced infection rates. In the latest re- port, there were 774,595 new adult Covid cases. Of infected adults, 7.7% (42,430) were unvaccinated and 84.4% (653,383) were doubly- or triply-vaccinated. This disparity becomes more pronounced with age. For example, among infected adults aged 60-69, 2.4% (1,952) were unvaccinated and 92.9% (75,967) were doubly- or triply-vaccinated. 18 The report cautions that \"it is expected that a large proportion of cases . . . would occur in vaccinated individuals, simply because a larger proportion of the population are vaccinated than unvaccinated.\" 19 But the UK's population vac- cination rate is around 72%.20 So, as in Germany, the data suggest that Covid infections are indifferent to the vaccines. 17 Emily Head & Dr. Sabine L. va n Elsland, \"Omicron largely evades immunity from past infection or two vaccine doses,\" Impe-rial Coll. of London (Dec. 17, 2021), https://bit.ly/3i4Fyg4. 18 UK Health Security Agency , \"COVID-19 vaccine surveil- lance report, Week 10\" (Mar. 10, 2022), at 40 (Table 10) https://bit.ly/36daJ60 (adults are all age cohorts 18 and older; doubly- and triply-vaccinated are individuals in \"Second dose\" and \"Third dose\" columns). 19 Id. at 40 n.1. 20 See supra note 15. 12 In Ontario, Canada, the case rate per 100,000 fully vaccinated Ontarians has risen sharply above the case rate per 100,000 unvaccinated Ontarians, again sug- gesting negative vaccine efficacy:21 21 Gov't of COVID-19 vaccinations data, https:// covid-19.ontario.ca/data (accessed Mar. 7, 2022; as of March 13, this webpage states, \"Due to technical difficulties, COVID-19 cases by vaccination status is not available\"). 13 14 In a test-negative control analysis of Ontario test data, researchers from P ublic Health Ontario and leading Canadian universities noted that \"[w]e also observed negative VE [vaccine effectiveness] against Omicron among those who had received 2 doses com- pared to unvaccinated individuals.\"22 The finding is ev- ident in Table 2 of the study. Researchers found that 60 days after the second dose, vaccine effectiveness turned and remained negative, meaning a vaccinated person was more likely to be infected than an unvac- cinated person: 23 22 Sarah Buchan et al., \"Effecti of COVID-19 vaccines against Omicron or Delta infection,\" medRxiv (Jan. 1, 2022), at 7, https://bit.ly/3i0TDuS (emphasis added). 23 Id. at 18. 15 16 Finally, there is New York itself, where widespread Covid vaccination\u201495% of adults have had at least one dose24\u2014has utterly failed to prevent the spread of the disease. As of December 22, 2021, New York City was seeing a \"staggering\" number of new Covid cases, and the CDC reported that \"New York and New Jersey were detecting omicron at four times the national av-erage rate.\" 25 B. Boosters are likewise ineffective, and their long-term effects may be harmful. \"Boosting\" does not solv e the problem of vaccine inefficacy. Based on well-kn own principles of virology, scientists expected the Covid virus, and particularly the spike protein targeted by the mRNA vaccines, to mutate rapidly to evade the body's immune response. That is precisely what has happened, and beyond Omi- cron, the virus will continue to mutate. Just this month, Dr. Walensky told NBC, \"I do anticipate that this is probably going to be a seasonal virus.\" 26 Vac- cines are generally ineffective at preventing seasonal virus spread. 24 New York State, \"Vaccine Progress to Date,\" https://coro- navirus.health.ny.gov/vaccinatio n-progress-date 25 Jennifer Millman, \"NYC Sees 'Staggering' New Daily Cases as CDC Estimates Omicron Prevalence Tops 90%,\" NBC New York , Dec. 23, 2021, https://bit.ly/3InH3kd. 26 Erika Edwards et al., \"Covid will 'probably' a sea- sonal virus, like the Walensky says,\" NBC News (Mar. 7, 2022), https://nbcne ws.to/3wbmB3o. 17 Further, there is no evidence that boosters halt transmission of the virus any more than the original vaccines, and boosters' protection against symptomatic infection is weak and quickly fading. In Israel, at the height of the Omicron surge in late January, the world's most vaccinated country experienced daily Covid cases that far exceed ed the United States, the EU, and Australia. 27 27 Our World in Data, COVID-19 Data Explorer, https:// ourworldindata.org/explorers/coronavirus-data-explorer; see supra note 15. 18 19 Further, \"[a] study conducted at Sheba Medical Center indicates a fourth shot of the Pfizer coronavirus vaccine provides insufficient protection against the Omicron variant,\" \"rais[ing] serious questions regard-ing Israel's current strategy of boosting all people over the age of 60.\" 28 Though Israeli officials recommended a fourth vaccine dose despite a lack of randomized evidence,29 experts elsewhere are sounding the alarm about re-peat boosters. EU health regulators have warned that \"frequent Covid-19 booster sh ots could adversely affect the immune system\" and \"weaken\" it over time. 30 Ac- cording to Marco Cavaleri, head of biological health threats and vaccine strategy for the European Medi- cines Agency, \"We will end up potentially having prob-lems with immune response, and immune response may end up not being as good as we would like it to be, thus we must take care not to overload the immune system with repeated vaccines.\" 31 In the face of these co ncerns, New York's mandate is ominously open-ended, defining \"fully vaccinated\" 28 \"Israeli study shows 4th vaccine shot 'not good enough' against Omicron,\" Times of Israel (Jan. 17, 2022), https://bit.ly/ 3q38323. 29 \"Israeli expert panel advises 4th vaccine dose for adults,\" Assoc.

COMP. CODES R. & REGS. tit. 10, \u00a7 2.61(a)(3) (2021). As physic ians and scientists, we find this deeply troubling. Th ere is no precedent, in ei- ther science or public policy, for a repeated medical in- tervention at this frequency and scale. No one knows what the consequences will be. In a Wall Street Journal editorial earlier this year, Dr. Luc Montagnier, the late Nobel Prize-winning vi-rologist who isolated the AIDS virus, summed up the matter well: \"It would be ir rational, legally indefensi- ble and contrary to the public interest for government to mandate vaccines absent any evidence that the vac- cines are effective in stopping the spread of the patho- gen they target. Yet that's exactly what's happening here.\" 32 II. Natural immunity is at least as effective and durable as vacci ne-based immunity, yet New York's mandate ignores it. Seven of the Petitioners here have already recov- ered from Covid\u2014they have natural immunity against the virus. Yet New York's vaccine mandate still re- quires them to be vaccinated on pain of losing their jobs. This is irrational. New York's mandate ignores the clear weight of scientific evidence confirming that natural immunity is at least as good as, if not superior 32 Luc Montagnier & Jed Rubenfeld, \"Omicron Makes Biden's Vaccine Man dates Obsolete,\" Wall St. J. (Jan. 9, 2022), https://on.wsj.com/3CFyAHH. 21 to, vaccine-based immunity. Forcing naturally-immune individuals to become vaccinated not only is unneces- sary but also heightens their risk of medical injury. And New York is increasingly an international out-lier\u2014the UK and the Netherlands, for example, now treat natural immunity as equivalent to vaccination. A. Natural immunity provides equivalent or better protecti on against Covid in- fection and severe disease. Both vaccine-based immunity and natural im- munity protect against severe disease from subse- quent Covid infection. Both are based on the same basic immunological mechanism\u2014stimulating the im- mune system to generate an antibody response. Yet multiple peer-reviewed studies have concluded that natural immunity provides equivalent or greater pro- tection against infection and severe disease than the immunity generated by the mRNA vaccines. A Cleveland Clinic study found that over a five- month period, Covid infection did not recur in 1,359 clinic employees who had recovered from a previous Covid infection and had been re-exposed to the virus. Cleveland Clinic researchers concluded \"that subjects previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 are unlikely to get COVID-19 reinfection whether or not they get the vaccine .\" 33 And they noted that their finding \"calls into 33 Nabin K. Shrestha et al., \"N COVID-19 infected individuals,\" medRxiv (June 5, 2021), https://bit.ly/3CzG9jb (emphasis added). 22 question the necessity to vaccinate those who have al- ready had SARS-CoV-2 infection.\"34 An Israeli study of more than 6 million individuals reached a similar con- clusion, finding that natural immunity provides equiv-alent if not better protection than vaccine immunity in preventing Covid infection, morbidity, and mortality. 35 \"Our results question the need to vaccinate previously-infected individuals,\" the authors observed. 36 Yet another recent study out of Israel found that vaccinated people who had not been previously in- fected were 13 times more likely to experience a break- through Covid infection, 27 times more likely to experience subsequent Covid symptoms, and seven times more likely to be hospitalized compared to natu- rally-immune individuals who had never been vac-cinated. 37 The design of this Israeli study was particularly strong because it tracked large cohorts of people over time, from the time of vaccination or initial infection, thus accounting for the fact that immunity protection (whether vaccine-based or natural) dimin- ishes with time. The study's authors concluded that \"natural immunity confers longer lasting and stronger 34 Ibid. 35 See Yair Goldberg et al., \"Pro tection of previous SARS- CoV-2 infection is similar to that of BNT162b2 vaccine protection: A three-month nationwide experience from Israel,\" medRxiv (Aug. 25, 2021), https://bit. ly/3CJROfh. 23 protection against infection, symptomatic disease and hospitalization caused by the Delta variant of SARS- CoV-2, compared to the BNT162b2 [Pfizer] two-dose vaccine-induced immunity.\"38 Many other studies from around the world confirm the Cleveland Clinic and Israeli experiences.39 B. Natural immunity provides longer-lasting protection. Not only is natural immunity equivalent or better at preventing infection and se vere disease. It also ap- pears to be more durable. A British Medical Journal article last year concluded, \"There is reason to think that immunity could last for several months or a cou- ple of years, at least, given what we know about other viruses and what we have s een so far in terms of anti- bodies in patients with COVID-19 and in people who 38 Ibid. 39 See, e.g., Roberto Bertollini et al., \"Associations of Vaccina- tion and of Prior Infection With Positive PCR Test Results for SARS-CoV-2 in Airline COVID- 19 protects against reinfection, even in the absence of detectable antibodies,\" The Journal of Infection , vol. 83(2), pp.237-79 (May al., \"SARS-CoV-2 re-infection risk in Austria,\" European Journal of Clinical Investigation , vol. 51(4) (Feb. 11, 2021), https://bit.ly/ 35YaBri. 24 have been vaccinated.\"40 A study in Nature found that a prior Covid infection induces \"robust\" and \"long- lived\" immunity, with antibody-producing cells \"re- maining detectable at least 11 months after infec-tion.\" 41 As the study's lead author noted, \"These cells will live and produce antibodies for the rest of people's lives. That's strong evidence for long-lasting immun-ity.\" 42 This correlates with the Israeli study which found natural immunity to be both more protective and \"longer lasting\" than vaccine-induced immunity.43 Other studies make clear that natural immunity is the benchmark against which vaccine-based immunity is measured\u2014not the other way around. 44 In other words, vaccination aims to replicate the sort of immunity that 40 Chris Baraniuk, \"How long does covid-19 immunity last?\", British Med.

Contrast these findings on natural immunity to what recent studies show about the Covid vaccines: that while they provide long-term protection against severe disease, their protection against infection and transmission is very short-lived. A Pfizer-funded study in California, which tracked infection rates for nearly 5 million patients vaccinated with two doses of the Pfizer vaccine, showed vaccine effectiveness at 90% in the first month but dropping to nearly 50% in the fifth month. 45 A study from Qatar shows an even steeper drop-off, with protection against infection peaking at about 77% one month after the second dose of an mRNA vaccine and then declining to about 20% in month five and after. 46 Even the CDC now recognizes the importance of natural immunity. Its updated science brief observes that \"SARS-CoV-2 infection decreased risk of subse- quent infection by 80-93% for at least 6-9 months,\" with some studies showing \"slightly higher protective 45 Sara Y.

Recent peer-reviewed evi- dence unfortunately confirms th at negative side effects from vaccination are more common and more severe in persons with a prior Covid infection.49 New York's 47 Ctrs. for Disease Control & Prevention, Science Brief: Infection-Induced and Vaccine-Induced Immun-ity (updated Oct. 29, 2021), https://bit.ly/3i2ICcr. The CDC does suggest that vaccine-induced immunity is stronger than immunity from natural infection, but the study it cites is weak authority. See ibid. (citing Catherine H. Bozio et al., \"Labora- tory-confirmed COVID-19 among adults hospitalized with COVID-19-like illness,\" Morbidity & Mortality Weekly Rpt. (Nov. 5, 2021), https://bit.ly/3KuVC6 S). Among other problems, the study compared naturally-immune individuals who were 90-225 days out from infection with vaccinated individuals who were 45-213 days out from vaccination. Because immunity\u2014regard-less of how gained\u2014wanes over time, the lack of comparability between these two time periods means the results are biased in favor of vaccine-induced immunity. The study itself admits this weakness. 48 Shrestha et al., supra note 32. 49 Alexander G.

On this, New York is increasingly an outlier. Other countries treat natural immunity as equivalent to vac- cination. The Netherlands recently extended the dura- tion of its \"natural immunity certificate,\" which can be used in lieu of a vaccine pa ssport, from 180 days to 365 days. 50 A similar exemption was made for natural im- munity in vaccine passports in the UK when the coun-try required them. 51 --------------------------------- --------------------------------- app in the UK: A prospective observational study,\" The Lancet Infectious Diseases 21(7), pp.939-49 (July 2021), https:// bit.ly/3w7jrNY (\"Systemic were more common [after one or two vaccine doses] among individuals with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection than am ong those without known past infection.

It in correctly presumes that the Covid vaccines effectively halt transmission, and it wrongly ignores natural immunity. The mandate should not be allowed to ove rride Petitioners' sincerely held religious beliefs. Amici respectfully urge the Court to grant the writ and reverse.
