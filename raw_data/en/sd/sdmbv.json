More information on the vaccine clinical trials in children is included in the NACI statements for [Moderna Spikevax COVID-19 vaccine](https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/phac-aspc/documents/services/immunization/national-advisory-committee-on-immunization-naci/recommendations-use-moderna-spikevax-covid-19-vaccine-children-6-months-5-years.pdf) in 6 months to 5 years of age and the Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty\u00ae COVID-19 vaccine in children [5 to 11 years of age](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/covid19-industry/drugs-vaccines-treatments/vaccines/pfizer-biontech.html) and in children [6 months to 4 years of age](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/immunization/national-advisory-committee-on-immunization-naci/recommendations-use-pfizer-biontech-comirnaty-3-mcg-covid-19-vaccine-children-6-months-4-years/summary-october-21-2022.html). Are the potential COVID-19 vaccine side effects the same in children as they are in adults? Generally, yes. Your child may experience side effects after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. Similar to what they might experience after receiving other vaccines, the side effects tend to be mild and should go away within a few days: - redness, swelling, or feeling sore where you had the needle - feeling tired - headache - fever or chills - body aches or sore joints - swollen lymph nodes - nausea, vomiting or diarrhea can occur but is very rare Should I consider getting my child vaccinated for COVID-19? Yes, the National Advisory Committee on Immunization believe (based on the clinical trials and scientific evidence) that there are many benefits to children who are vaccinated, including: - Reduced risk of getting COVID-19 - although evidence suggests that children who get COVID-19 experience milder symptoms, some children can become very sick and may need to be hospitalized. - Prevent or reduce the spread of COVID-19 - both adults and children can spread the COVID-19 virus to others if they are infected, even if they are not experiencing any symptoms. Being vaccinated against COVID-19 helps protect children and others by reducing the chance that they transmit the virus to others if they become infected, including to family members, friends and classmates who may be at greater risk of becoming severely ill from the virus. - Help prevent other COVID-19 variants from emerging - scientific evidence shows the number of cases of children with COVID-19 is increasing, especially with the presence of the highly contagious Omicron variant. Reducing the COVID-19 virus' ability to spread by getting vaccinated also reduces the ability for the virus to mutate or change into a new variant that may be even more contagious and cause more severe illness in people who are infected. - Help protect the community - with every person who is vaccinated, the more our communities are protected, including our families, friends, neighbours, schools, day cares, and workplaces. Each person infected with COVID-19, including a child, is more likely to spread the virus to others. If this happens, those infected are more likely to spread the virus to others they are in close contact with. This creates the opportunity for community outbreaks and for the virus to mutate or change, creating a new variant. How many doses of the vaccine is recommended for children 6 months to 5 years of age? It is recommended that children 6 months to 5 years of age be vaccinated for COVID-19 with either mRNA vaccine approved for this age group. There are currently two vaccines approved for children 6 months to 5 years of age. NACI preferentially recommends Moderna Spikevax TM vaccine for infants 6 months to 5 years of age. Moderna Spikevax is administered in a 2 dose schedule 8 weeks apart. Pfizer Corminaty TM is also approved for infants 6 months to 4 years of age. Pfizer CorminatyTM is administered in a 3 dose schedule with each dose 8 weeks between each dose My child is currently 5 years old. Which vaccine should my child receive? For children 5 years of age, for whom both the Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty (10 mcg) and Moderna authorized, Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty (10 mcg) is preferred. Children 5 years of age who receive the Moderna Spikevax vaccine (25 mcg) to start their primary series but turn 6 prior to completing their primary series are recommended to receive the Moderna Spikevax (50) mcg vaccine to complete their primary series. If your child receives Moderna Spikevax for their first dose of vaccine, they are recommended to receive Moderna Spikevax for their second dose to complete their primary series with the same vaccine product. My child is currently 11 years old and will be turning 12 in the coming months, should I wait until they are 12 years old to get them vaccinated for COVID-19? Children who are currently 11 years old can receive the pediatric COVID-19 vaccine for their first dose and the adult version as their second dose if they turn 12 within the recommended 8-week interval between first and second doses. It is safe to mix the pediatric and adult doses in situations like this, and children will still build a strong immunity response to the virus. Who can consent in PEI for immunizations? In PEI, consent to immunizations falls under the [Consent to Treatment and Health Care Directives Act](https://www.princeedwardisland.ca/sites/default/files/legislation/c-17-2-consent_to_treatment_and_health_care_directives_act.pdf) [Act]. Under the Act, - All persons (including children) are presumed to have capacity to consent to treatment, including immunizations, until the contrary is shown. - A health practitioner cannot provide an immunization unless the health practitioner is of the opinion the patient with capacity has given consent or, if the patient is incapable with respect to the treatment, another appropriate person has given the required consent. How long after receiving another vaccine (e.g. flu vaccine) should my child wait before receiving the COVID-19 vaccine? COVID-19 vaccines may be given concurrently with (i.e., same day), or at any time before or after, non-COVID-19 vaccines (including live and non-live vaccines) for children 6 months and older. How can I prepare my child for getting the vaccine? A few days before their vaccination, talk to your child about getting vaccinated. Be calm, honest, and don't lie about what to expect. Talk about why they are getting the vaccine and how it will protect them and the people they spend time with. Talk to them about the procedure itself, what will happen and that the nurse will help take care of them. Public Health Nurses have a lot of experience with vaccinating children and have tips and tricks to make the procedure less scary.

Here are a few things to remember on the day of the appointment: - Do not attend the appointment if your child is having symptoms of illness; fever, cough, sore throat. You can reschedule your child's appointment at a COVID-19 Immunization Clinic for a later date when they are feeling better. - Review the information in the fact sheet for the vaccine prior to your child's appointment - Your child should wear a short sleeve shirt - Your child should wear a mask If you are attending your child's vaccination appointment, it is important that you are not experiencing symptoms of illness. You will need to wear a mask during the appointment. My child is afraid of needles, what can I do to make the experience better for them? Dr. Jackie Goodwin, Health PEI clinical psychologist, has five key tips for helping parents understand needle fear and how to support their child leading up to and during the vaccination: It is important to let the Public Health Nurse know that your child has some needle fear. Public Health Nurses have a lot of experience with vaccinating children and can make the experience less scary for children. For more information, resources and videos to help understand needle fear and supporting your child in getting the COVID-19 vaccine, visit: [www.aboutkidshealth.ca/COVID-19](https://www.aboutkidshealth.ca/COVID-19). When is my child considered to be fully immunized? Children ages 6 months to 11 years of age are considered fully immunized 14 days after receiving (2 doses) of the COVID-19 vaccine. Is a booster or third dose recommended for children? Yes, the Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty (10 mcg) mRNA COVID-19 vaccine is authorized as a booster dose in children 5 to 11 years of age. This is the first COVID-19 vaccine authorized as a booster dose in this age group. Currently, NACI has not recommended a booster or third dose for children 6 months to 4 years of age. NACI continues to review data to determine if a booster doses will be needed. What if my child is allergic to components of the COVID-19 vaccine? It is possible that someone may have an allergic reaction after receiving COVID-19 vaccine. Individuals with known allergies to any of the components of the vaccine should not receive it. Potential non-medicinal ingredients in the vaccines known to cause a reaction ranging from mild skin reactions to Moderna Spikevax |Yes||Yes||No| Will my child have access to a COVID-19 immunization record once they are vaccinated? Yes, all eligible individuals who are vaccinated on Prince Edward Island will have access to their own COVID-19 immunization record. For more information about accessing a PEI COVID-19 immunization record, [click here](/en/information/health-and-wellness/covid-19-immunization-record). What if my child is immunocompromised or has an autoimmune disorder? The [National Advisory Committee on Immunization](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/immunization/national-advisory-committee-on-immunization-naci.html) recommends that eligible individuals, including children 5 to 11 years of age, who are immunocompromised or who have an autoimmune disorder be offered the COVID-19 vaccine as long as informed consent is given. Informed consent should include information about the lack of data on the use of the COVID-19 vaccines in these populations. It is recommended that children 6 months to 4 years of age who are moderately to severely immunocompromised and do not have contraindications to the vaccine may be offered a primary series that includes an additional dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine You may choose for your child to be vaccinated, particularly if they are at increased risk for COVID-19 infection or severe disease. Individuals should be aware of the absence of evidence on the use of COVID-19 vaccines in these individuals and be able to provide [informed consent](/en/form/covid-immunization-clinic-registration-form). For those children who are moderately to severely immunocompromised 5 years of age and older who have previously received 2-doses of COVID-19 vaccine an additional dose of an authorized mRNA COVID-19 vaccine should be offered; this applies to individuals with the following conditions: - active treatment for solid tumour or hematologic malignancies - receipt of solid-organ transplant and taking immunosuppressive therapy - receipt of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T-cell therapy or hematopoietic stem cell transplant (within 2 years of transplantation or taking immunosuppression therapy) - moderate to severe primary immunodeficiency (e.g., DiGeorge syndrome, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome) - Stage 3 or advanced untreated HIV infection and those with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome - active treatment with the following categories of immunosuppressive therapies: anti-B cell therapies systemic days), alkylating agents, antimetabolites, or tumor-necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors and other biologic agents that are significantly immunosuppressive. What is the Vaccine Injury Support Program? The Vaccine Injury Support Program (VISP) is a no-fault program that provides compensation for anyone vaccinated in Canada (except Quebec) who has experienced a serious and permanent injury as a result of receiving any Health Canada authorized vaccine after December 8, 2020.
