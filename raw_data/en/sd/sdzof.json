There were no apologies. 2/22 Item 2 - Declaration of Interests 2/22.1 The Chair asked if anyone had interests to declare releva nt to any items on the agenda. Mr Irvine declared an interest in relation to the fuel poverty paper that was attached to the Chair's Business as it references work with local Councils. - | Page 2 | - 3/22 Item 3 - Minutes of previous meeting held on 16 December 2021 3/22.1 The minutes of the Board meeting held on 16 December 2021 were APPROVED as an accurate r ecord of that meeting, subject to the insertion of an additional paragraph at the end of section 141/21 indicating that the B oard approved of AMT's decision to approve the initiatives outlined in the \" Proposed Approach for Managing PHA in- year Funding\" paper. 4/22 Item 4 - Matters Arising 4/22.1 4/22.2 4/22.3 144/21.1 PHA Budget The Chair said that he wished to get clarity on what funding is ring fenced and to receive a list of those areas where the Board does not have discretion on how funds are spent. He added that he would then wish to see a list of those areas where the Board has discretion on how funding can be spent . Ms McCaig explained that there had been a discussion about ring fenced areas of the PHA budget and these are set out in the Finance Report. She advised that COVID and Transformation are two areas that are ring fenced, as is PHA's management and administration budget. She said that she would refer to each element as she went through the Report. She noted that t he situation is variable and requires to be continually updated. Ms Henderson suggested that, with regard to the COVID -19 pandemic, there may come a stage when contact tracing becomes pointless, but she noted that this may be discussed as part of the COVI D-19 update later. Ms Henderson noted that one of the areas considered by the Board last month for additional spend was diabetes and there was a paper on outcomes that had been prepared by Dr Brid Farrell. She asked if it would be possible for members to see this paper. The Chief Executive undertook to get this paper for members (Action 1 - Chief Executive ). 5/22 Item 5 - Chair's Business 5/22.1 5/22.2 5/22.3 The Chair thanked all those staff who, since the advent of Omicron, have been required to put in a huge amount of time, effort and commitment to support the Agency's response. He acknowledg ed particularly those staff who gave up time over their Christmas holidays to assist. The Chair informed members that Mr Irvine has agreed to join the Governance and Audit Committee and that Ms Henderson and Alderman Brett will be joining the Remuneration and Terms of Service Committee. The Chair advised that a workshop is being organised in late February - | Page 3 | - 5/22.4 5/22.5 5/22.6 5/22.7 5/22.8 5/22.9 to discuss the PHA Business Plan. The Chair reported that he has had a meeting with Ms Heather Stevens who has been as ked by the Department of Health to lead on the work on the implementation of the new operating model for PHA. He said that he impressed on her the need to ensure that there is Non- Executive Director (NED) involvement , particularly in the strategic elements of this work . He added that th e new model should envision public health needs of the population for at least the next 10 to 15 years. The Chair said that Ms Stevens had reported back to him that she had held a useful meeting with the Permanent Secretary and the Chief Medical Officer and that the Permanent Secretary has indicated that he is willing to commit resources to ensure that there is adequate support to the Oversight Board. At this poi nt Dr Bergin joined the meeting. Ms Mann -Kler welcomed this update and asked whether there is any indication regarding timescales. The Chair said that while there was no indication given, he has been told it should be about 18 months. He added that while there was no update on when the Oversight Board will meet, he had emphasised the need for NED involvement. Mr Clayton welcomed the update in the Chair's Report on fuel poverty and suggested that there should be a workshop on this topic . He said that PHA is involved in a number of programmes and he would like to know more about how it is using data to target resources. The Chair agreed that this was a critical issue as it affects so many people. Dr Bergin commented that the situation with regard to fuel poverty could get a lot worse over time and that PHA's resources are a drop in the ocean compared to potential need and what other agencies provide financially. He advised that t he PHA is working with the community and voluntary sector to help direct people to the relevant organisations. Ms Mann -Kler s aid that it would be useful to get more inf ormation as this is an area where there should be joined up Government working. She asked how PHA is evaluating the impact, effectiveness and value for money of its investment and if it is having the necessary impact. The Chair suggested that there was an opportunity to talk to organisations to see if they could modify their servic es in response to this crisis. Dr Bergin pointed out that the staff who would work in this area are presently dealing with Omicron. The Chair said that although it is a difficult balance, the current plight of people experiencing fuel poverty would justify getting t hose staff back to look at this area. It was agreed that a discussion on fuel poverty would form part of a future workshop (Action 2 - Chief Executive) . The Chair advised that he had held a meeting last week with Internal Audit to discuss the report of their audit of PHA Board Effectiveness. He - | Page 4 | - 5/22.10 5/22.11 5/22.12 added that he had attended another meeting with Internal Audit this week, along with the Chief Executive. He reported that the first draft of the report is currently being considered and one of the questions that arose was about how often NEDs met on their own. He recalled that when he organise d meetings for NEDs alone, there was much resistance from some Executive Director s who believed that such meetings should not take place. The Chair quoted that this was a policy in the handbook of the Institute of Directors and was also policy in the Institute for Chartered Secretaries and Administrators. He said that it is important that NEDs should not be judged for having such meetings. Ms Henderson asked if the Chair was therefore proposing that a meeting of NEDs take place, and if that was the main finding of the report. The Chair advised that meetings have been taking place an d will continue to do so . He advised that the report on Board Effectiveness by Internal Audit will come to the full Board in due course, and that he had asked for a note outlining the various stages of the process . Professor Rooney asked if members wil l see the report soon. The Chief Executive said that his understanding was that the report would go to the Governance and Audit Committee (GAC) in the first instance. Mr Stewart said that he would be speaking to Mrs Catherine McKeown from Internal Audit on Monday and he would get clarity on the timescales. He confirmed that the report would come to GAC, but he would also be seeking clarity in terms of at what point the report changes from being a draft report to a completed report with all participants h aving had an opportunity to comment. The Chair agreed that it would be useful to understand what the process will be. Ms McCaig said that normally there would be a first draft and the lead Director would review it, and then it will be up to that lead Dir ector to determine who else should be involved in reviewing it. She said that at that point it would then go to GAC for scrutiny. She added that it would be up to the lead to ensure that the report is correct, backed up by evidence and that the comments are a full view of the position. At this point Mr Irvine left the meeting. Mr Stewart said that as this audit is different than other audit, he would wish to know who accepts it and signs it off given that it involves the Board as a whole, or is it signed off jointly by the Chair and Chief Executive. Ms McCaig said that the report would be signed off by the Chair and Chief Executive, but in consultation with the whole Board. 6/22 Item 6 - Finance Report (PHA/0 1/01/22) 6/22.1 6/22.2 Ms McCaig said that follow ing the earlier discussion on ring fenced allocations, she would share with all NEDs the information she had prepared for the new NEDs on the PHA budget (Action 2 - Ms McCaig) Ms McCaig presented the Finance Report for the period up to 30 - | Page 5 | - 6/22.3 6/22.4 6/22.5 6/22.6 6/22.7 6/22.8 6/22.9 November 2021 and said that there is a year to date surplus of \u00a3800k. She advised that the programme budget is largely on track with some overspends and underspends due to timing issues. She added that no issues have been raised by managers but the situation will be kept under review as the last quarter is where demand- led services tend to be more volatile so caution is required. Ms McCaig explained that the SBNI budget is ring fenced as any surplus must be offered back to the Department. She added that other budgets, for example, are earmarked funds, where the se are provided for specific programmes with little flexibility. She agreed to prepare a high level paper outlining the different categorisations of funds (Action 3 - Ms McCaig) . Ms McCaig advised that the projected year end position is a surplus of \u00a3421k which is above PHA's permitted break even target. She said that the Agency Management Team (AMT) has again been reviewing areas for potential investment, but there is a number of risks that need to be borne in mind. She explained that the COVID -19 downturn figure will need to be monitored because while she has secured agreement for some funding to be offset against contact tracing spend, the i ncome of Omicron has resulted in PHA staff again being redeployed to contact tracing, therefore requiring the \u00a38.3m budget to be reviewed again. Ms McCaig said that of the four new areas for spend, two of which had been factored into last month's report and the other two have been factored into this month's r eport. Within the management and administration budget, she advised that there has been slippage within the nursing and operations budgets. She advised that the accrual figure will need to be reviewed as staff had to work over Christmas. Ms McCaig gave an overview of the key risks, reiterating the need for ongoing monitoring of the programme budget and the management and administration budget. She said that there remain some issues with funding to Trusts with IPTs and business cases not being completed. Ms McCaig ad vised that there is approximately \u00a37m of the capital allocation still be utilised, but she was content that it would be fully spent. The Chair asked if any of the surplus could be used for media campaigns. Ms McCaig noted that there is a cap on how much PHA can spend on media campaigns. Mr Wilson confirmed that that is the position and that PHA has reached that threshold. He also noted that there is a complicating factor in that PHA is in the process of procuring its advertising contract. Ms Henderson noted that the risks around underspend have reduced, but she expressed concern about the Trust spend and sought clarity about IPTs. Ms McCaig explained that there is always a business place - | Page 6 | - 6/22.10 6/22.11 6/22.12 6/22.13 6/22.14 and if a service is being delivered there should be an IPT in pla ce. She assured members that Trusts are accepting all of their funding following her intervention. Ms Henderson said that it is important that all vacant posts are filled and following her attendance at the Procurement Board on Monday, it is vital that P HA gets procurement expertise. She said that she was unsure as to whether PHA can wait for the review to be completed before making any decisions. Ms McCaig said that there is a staffing budget which has a clear structure and any slippage is as a result of new posts not being filled. She added that a recruitment exercise can take up to 6 months. Ms Henderson suggested that the current risk will roll forward into 2022/23. Mr Morton advised that there are new posts to be recruited in his directorate, inc luding an Assistant Director of Public Health Nursing, but this has been delayed due to the timescale in finalising the job description and the banding and then seeking approval from the Department to proceed with recruitment. He said that he has been working with Mr Robin Arbuthnot in Human Resources to look at a recovery plan and he would be happy to give the Board an update on this. The Chair asked that this be prepared and sent to the Secretariat for dissemination to the Board (Action 4 - Mr Morton) . Mr Stewart said that this is not the first time that PHA has been in a position of having a surplus and even before COVID -19 this was an issue. He said that there needs to be a proper resourcing plan to avoid PHA constantly being in this situation of hav ing a high number of vacant posts. Mr Stewart noted that this report is for the period up to 30 November and asked what the current situation is. He also asked if there was an update on the Government's plan to have a 3- year financial settlement. Ms McC aig said that at this moment she is not noting any significant movement in terms of the financial position on the programme side, but within the management and administration budget, the surplus could grow given the earlier discussion about the costs of th e contact tracing centre and the impact on the COVID -19 downturn figure. She advised that she had spoken to Mr Wilson about placing this on the PHA's Corporate Risk Register. She agreed that PHA has been in this position before but it will continue to look at priorities between now and the end of the year in a bid to manage the surplus and to meet the 0.25% target. In terms of the 3 -year budget, she said that it would be her intention to give a high level presentation, but she noted that at this stage, t here is no indication of organisations being able to carry forward funding between years. She said she would await the outcome of the public consultation before doing a presentation. The Chair said that in advocating the 3- year budget planning process, the most positive element was the ability to carry forward funding, but now it appears that element will be removed. Ms McCaig said that she - | Page 7 | - 6/22.15 6/22.16 6/22.17 6/22.18 was not sure that this was definitely the case, but in any event, it should not be an issue for PHA if it is on top of its brief. The Chair commented that in both the private and voluntary sectors, there is a benefit having that discretion to be able to carry over funds. Ms McCaig said that 3-year funding will bring a level of certainty for organisations, but challenges will remain. Mr Clayton recalled that Transformation funding was allowed to be carried forward, but he was not sure if this was a direction from the Treasury. In terms of contact tracing spend , he noted that last year there was a concern that PHA was spending funding without an approved business case in place, so he sought clarity on whether there was a risk to PHA this year if it did not have the funding. He added that he agreed with Mr Stewart's suggestion that there needs to be a workshop looking at workforce planning. Ms McCaig said that the risk to PHA this year is almost the opposite to last year whereby because PHA has had to redeploy staff to contact tracing, it is not spending the additional money it has been allocated so does not require the full funding of the approved business case, but she is working to try to divert some of the funding. Ms Henderson said that she supported Mr Morton's proposal about preparing a paper on recruitment. She surmised that perhaps the market is not there to fill some of the posts, but it is a priority that the posts are filled or else PHA will not be able to deliver its business. She suggested that time could be taken at a future meeting to look at this, but she took comfort in the fact that a plan will be progressed. She asked whether action to replace a post starts once it is known that a person is leaving. Ms McCaig said that it would, but pointed out that there are a lot of steps required before a post can be recruited, including possibly getting approv al from the Permanent Secretary. The Chief Executive noted that while PHA is not spending as much on contact tracing, he assured members that recruitment is continuing. He added that opportunities have been offered to contact tracing staff and PHA staff who have been trained to benefit from the payment of overtime. The Chief Executive said that he agreed with Mr Stewart's view that there is a need to have a strategy on HR, recruitment and workforce planning. He noted that part of the issue is that many of the vacancies relate to what he described as PHA's old way of working, but as PHA will be transitioning to a new model, posts could not necessarily be recruited on a like- for-like basis and there is a need to look at the longer term. He agreed that t his is now a new issue and that COVID -19 should not be used a reason for having a financial surplus. He said that a workforce plan should be developed to tease out all the issues, but he conceded that some of the issues may continue in the short term. - | Page 8 | - 7/22 Item 7 - Update on 7/22.4 7/22.5 7/22.6 presentation updating members on COVID -19. He showed that the number of daily cases has begun to decrease, but he noted that there has been a change in the testing strategy. However, he was confident t hat there is a downward trajectory. He showed the breakdown of cases by age and noted that there is a long way to go until the numbers return to a manageable level. He reported that at one point 6% of the population was affected by Omicron. Dr Bergin re ported that the situation would have been a lot worse had it not been for the vaccination and booster programmes. He showed the historic pattern of hospital admissions and pointed out that present admission s are lower than those at this time last year. H e said that there was very little increase in ICU admissions during this Omicron wave and that deaths are lower than last year. Looking to the future, Dr Bergin suggested that there may be new variants, or new viruses or other non- communicable disease events so PHA needs to be prepared. He said that the health protection response needs to be built up in areas such as surveillance, analytics, incident management and contact tracing. He added that PHA's capacity and capability needs to increase and suggest ed that if PHA were to become like a public health school, there would be stronger organisational resilience in many areas. Mr Stewart said that the presentation was informative and asked Dr Bergin what the position is with regard to vaccination going for ward, and what this will mean for the workload of PHA, and if there will be more booster programmes. The Chief Executive reported that before Christmas there was a surge in the number of people getting vaccinated but since Christmas this has dropped off s o there are meetings taking place to see how people can be encouraged to get their boosters. He added that for the foreseeable future there will be a need for vaccination against COVID -19 and while no decisions have been made, he said that at some point t his responsibility will transfer to PHA which will have implications for the organisation as it is a whole new area of service delivery. Ms Mann -Kler asked how far away it is from the pandemic becoming endemic and what implications this has for PHA, and h ow it affects PHA's business planning. She expressed a concern that there is an implication that everything that PHA has done during the pandemic was in rapid response, but there are implications for other programmes. She said that there is an opportunit y for PHA to capitalise as more people are aware of the organisation. She added that this is critical that following any relaxation of restrictions, the messaging must be crystal clear. Dr Bergin said that this is a complex area as very few communicable - | Page 9 | - 7/22.7 7/22.8 7/22.9 7/22.10 7/22.11 diseases have gone away. He added that this is a novel virus, and a potent one, and even if 95% of the population is vaccinated, that still leaves 5% and these people may not be evenly distributed, leaving the potential for outbreaks in localised hotspots . He felt that the biggest risk will be in 5/7 years' time if there is a lapse, so there is a need to continue to build up immunity through vaccination and natural immunity. He said that PHA will be dealing with this for the next 20 years. The Chair ask ed if there was any information on whether Omicron has resulted in increased hospitalisations. Dr Bergin reported that there have been less people ending up in hospital and the majority of current inpatients are Delta variant cases. Ms Mann -Kler asked about the return to \"business as usual\" and if PHA has a handle on the impact of pausing programme work. Dr Bergin advised that he has asked Dr Tracy Owen to bring a report on screening programmes to a future meeting. He indicated that the main screening p rogrammes are 6/18 months behind schedule and the impact of this will be a delay in diagnosing cancers. He advised that screening is ongoing, but only at 75% of pre- pandemic levels. The Chief Executive said that there are two issues, one is public hesitancy and the other is what PHA can control. He acknowledged that PHA is behind in its delivery and the impact of these delays in impacting on the HSC as well as across wider society. The Chief Executive reported that PHA staff remain redeployed to contact tracing and will be until the end of January, at which point he hoped they will be able to return to their substantive roles. He noted that while there is a Government view that society is returning to normal, he felt that the number of daily cases rem ains high with the contact tracing centre having to follow up 6,000 people per day. However, he reiterated that he would like to phase staff back to their usual roles by the end of January. Mr Clayton said that Dr Bergin's presentation was useful and cle ar, and the section on future preparedness was very important and linked to the discussion earlier in the meeting about workforce planning. While he noted that Omicron was less severe than Delta, he said that the real issue was that it caused major staff absence and led to delays in discharging people back into the community. He said he would welcome comment from Directors on the impact of staff absence in PHA and some information in terms of PHA's support to the wider HSC system to minimise the impact of staff absence on service delivery. Dr Bergin said that Occupational Health departments would be the first port of call for Trust to access support regarding staff absence. Mr Clayton noted that Omicron has had an impact in terms of the number of people needing to self -isolate. He added that the number of outbreaks in care homes has increased massively so he wanted to know about the support from PHA. - | Page 10 | - 7/22.12 7/22.13 7/22.14 7/22.15 7/22.16 The Chief Executive reported that the impact of absence on PHA has been very low. He advised that throug h Mr Wilson's directorate a daily report is prepared looking at staff absence and today the figure is 6.2% with only 2.75% relating to COVID -19. Compared to the rest of the HSC, which has an average of 11- 12%, he said that PHA is doing well. The Chief Ex ecutive advised that he wrote to Directors about the safeguarding of staff working from home and staff resilience given there will be a fatigue in dealing with COVID -19. He noted that other organisations are experiencing staff absence for reasons other than COVID - 19. He commended the work of staff and suggested that the low absence rate indicated that PHA was doing well in terms of staff welfare. The Chief Executive said that, with regard to care homes, a review of outbreaks showed that, in order to allow homes to take admissions, there needed to be a change in the definition of an outbreak whereby it is defined as a situation where there is demonstrable transmission in the home. He added that information packs have been sent to all care homes. Mr Morto n said that when the revised guidelines were prepared, ECHO sessions were set up for care home managers. He advised that previously he and Mr Whittle had developed a risk matrix for care homes where there was a concern and a need to have a discussion with the home. He said that to date matters have been able to be resolved but it has not been an easy process, and has involved a lot of work with the homes. Mr Whittle said that the work PHA has been leading on to support the workforce has been helpful as h as the work with care homes to allow them to support the HSC system in terms of timely discharges from hospitals. He added that work is continuing to manage the balance of the flow from hospitals and what care homes can manage. He said that the guidance is tracked on a daily basis. Mr Morton advised that there are regular meetings with care homes and work has commenced on a safe staffing model. The Chief Executive said that he would like to thank the Board for its support over the last month and for agr eeing to have a shorter agenda at today's meeting which allowed staff to divert their resources into dealing with Omicron. He said he wished to thank senior managers for their work since the onset of Omicron and that he was proud of their efforts. He add ed that that over the festive period staff gave up time without complaint and displayed huge professionalism. In terms of policy, he noted that it is for the PHA Board as a whole to ensure that the Minister's policies are implemented and those policies have changed over the last few months and therefore so has PHA's response. Going forward, the Chief Executive said the main risk for PHA is around the financial situation. He advised that he had no conduct issues to report on. He reported that he has spok en to the Directors about implementing a \"buddying\" system with Board members and he would bring that back to a future meeting (Action 5 - Chief Executive) . He advised that he has had an initial discussion with Ms Heather Stevens - | Page 11 | - and he will bring a forma l update to the next Board meeting (Action 6 - Chief Executive) . He said that Ms Stevens is developing a plan and she is keen to formulate the constitution of the Programme Board, and he would wait and see what proposals she comes up with. 8/22 Item 8 - Future PHA Board Workshops 8/22.1 8/22.2 The Chair advised that he had asked Mr Graham to search through the minutes of previous meetings and list those topics which had been proposed by members. He said that he and the Chief Executive would be meeting to discuss these. Mr Clayton asked if there would be a workshop on strategy. The Chair confirmed that there would be, and said that in his opinion, the Agency needed to develop a 10- year strategy in addition to the Corporate Plan. 9/22 Item 9 - Any Other Business 9/22.1 With there being no other business, the Chair thanked members for their time and drew the meeting to a close. 10/22 Item 10 - Details of Next Meeting Thursday 17 February 2022 at 1:30pm Fifth Floor Meeting Room, 12/22 Linen hall Street, Belfast, BT2 7B S Signed by Chair: Date: Tracey McCaig Director of Finance January 2022 Finance Report December 2021 Section A: Introduction /Background 1. The PHA Financial Plan for 2021/22 was approved by the PHA Board in the June 2021 Board meeting, which described the opening financial position of the organisation and reported an anticipated breakeven position within 2021/22. 2. The Financial Plan identified a number of areas of projected slippage and how this was to be used to address in -year pressures and priorities. 3. This executive summary report reflects the latest position, as at the end of December 2021 (month 9). Supplement ary detail in the format of previous reports is provided in Annex A . Section B: Update - Revenue position 4. The PHA has reported a year to date surplus , at December 2021 , of \u00a30.8m (\u00a30.8m at Novem ber 2021) . 5. In respect of the year to date surplus of \u00a30. 8m: The profiled PHA Programme is showing a small underspend against profile for the year to date (c\u00a30.3m) , mainly due to some minor underspends within Health Improvement due to the timing of payments . Budget holders continue to be reminded to keep all programme budgets under close review, and report any expected slippage or pressures at an early stage. As reported previously, there continues to be an underspend in the Management & Admin budget (c\u00a30.9m) , primarily in the areas of Nursing & AHP and Operations, which reflects a high level of vacant posts in each area, along w ith reduced non -pay expenditure which is a result of different working arrangements due to the pandemic . Efforts are on -going to fill vacant posts as soon as possible. An overspend is noted in respect of Covid funding (c\u00a30.6m) which reflects Covid downtu rn in respect of core operations being offset against funding requirements for, primarily, the Contact Tracing Centre. A surplus is being reported in respect of strictly ringfenced funding (c\u00a30.2m), primarily in the area of Delivering Care. This has been reported to DoH, however DoH have indicated that they currently do not intend to retract this funding. 6. The updated position is summarised in the table below.

Table may be subject to minor rounding differences 7. The current forecast of the year end position is a surplus of \u00a30. 45m (\u00a30.42m at month 8), and is being largely driven by management and administration slippage . It should be noted that this is marginally above the PHA's breakeven limit of approximately \u00a3 0.33m and opportunities to manage this continue to be considered . 8. Followin g a review of Pr ogramme planned expenditure , it should be noted : The position in relation to Programme expenditure continues to be under constant review, to identify slippage and / or pressures; Anticipated slippage within management and administration budgets remains high as the expected start dates of some senior posts within Public Health and Nursing have been delayed. An element of the year -end annual leave accrual has been released to reflec t leave carried forward from 2020 - 21 being utilised , however the final position on the 2021/22 is required to be kept under close review; Covid related downturn has been projected in a number of areas, including the Smoking Cessation budget (\u00a30.6m surplus) and Bowel Screening (\u00a30.2m surplus) , which will be offset against Covid allocations for the Contact Tracing Centre (CTC) , leaving a net pressure on Covid funding ; Contact Tracing Centre expenditure total ling \u00a38.3m has been projected, with a net allocation requirement of \u00a37.5m being advised to DoH Finance as a result of the Covid downturn set out above . As case numbers fluctuate, the estimate of additional funding required continually changes, and t his position will be managed clos ely in the approach to ye ar-end. Funding of \u00a37m has currently been received and any balance required will continue to be managed in the context of PHA's overall financial position; A surplus is being reported in respect of strictly ringfenced funding (c\u00a30.2m), primarily in the ar ea of Delivering Care. As referenced above, this has been reported to DoH, however recently DoH have indicated that they currently do not intend to retract this funding. Section C: Risks 9. Internal Programme expenditure outturn . As in previous year, Programme expenditure needs to be monitored closely to ensure that planned expenditure is met. The PHA senior team has conduct ed a mid-year review of expenditure plans and taken action to reallocate to approved developments and pressures as set out above. The reported position reflects th is mid-year review, however this is subject to ongoing monitoring. 10. Funds not yet a llocated to Trusts. There remains some funding intended to go to Trusts which has not yet been allocated due to the necessary I nvestment Proposal Templates (IPTs) / business cases not being complete. There is a risk that Trusts will not be able to fully spend this funding before year -end, and therefore PHA may be left with a surplus at year -end. Management have been reminded to pri oritise this area to ensure this risk is minimised and highlighted . 11. Management and Administration expenditure outturn. This is closely monitored by the Finance team , in conjunction with PHA management, to ensure that the forecast financial position is updated on a monthly basis. However, given current plans and timelines for recruitment , the level of slippage is unlikely to reduce before year -end. 12. Ring -fenced funding - Covid . The position assumes that all areas of expenditure funded via Covid funding wil l breakeven , with the exception of the Contact Tracing Centre, where Covid downturn within PHA has been identified to offset Covid funding required . Currently the majority of Covid expenditure (c\u00a35.8m) relates to the Contact Tracing Centre , with the balance of \u00a3 1.5m relating to small er Covid projects . A business case in respect of the Contact Tracing Service was issued to the DoH and additional funding of \u00a32m has subsequently been allocated , bringing funding to c\u00a37m , with the expectation a further allocation if required . PHA will work closely with DoH Finance as we approach year -end to manage the breakeven position . Regular review s are undertaken on all areas relating to Covid ring -fenced funding, to identify any areas of risk and close liaison will continue with the D oH. 13. Covid response impact on PHA. It has been a challenging period for PHA, not least from the focus on the operational nature of the Contact Tracing Service and the support to ma nage service pressures due to Covid response. Staff members have been diverted internally to support the response . 14. Annual leave. The annual leave usage levels reported to date remain proportionately lower than reflective of the point in the financial year , which may ultimately result in an additional cost in the financial year . The financial impact of this is being kept under review. 15. Due to the complex nature of Health & Social Care, there will undoubtedly be further challenges with financial impacts which will be presented in year. PHA will continue to monitor and manage these with DoH and Trust colleagues on an ongoing basis. Section D: Update - Capital position 16. The PHA has a current capital allocation (CRL) of \u00a3 14.0m. The majority of this (\u00a312.6m) relates to Research & Development (R&D). 17. Other PHA Capita l includes an allocation of \u00a3358k for the Congenital Heart Disease Professorship Network to be set up across Ireland and \u00a3 800k for a Covid - 19 Wastewater project. There is also currently a small allocation of \u00a392k for ICT capital expenditure within PHA, and \u00a3141k for ICT linked to the Con tact Tracing Centre. 18. The overall summary position is reflected in the table overleaf .

R&D expenditure is managed through the R& D Division within PHA, and funds essential infrastructure for research such as information databanks, tissue banks, clinical research facilities, clinical trials units and research networks. The element relating to 'Trusts' is allocated throughout the fina ncial year, and the allocation for 'Other Bodies' is used predominantly within universities - both allocations fund agreed projects that enable and support clinical and academic researchers. 20. CHITIN (Cross -border Healthcare Intervention Trials in Ireland N etwork) is a unique cross -border partnership between the Public Health Agency in Northern Ireland and the Health Research Board in the Republic of Ireland, to develop infrastructure and deliver Healthcare Intervention Trials (HITs). The CHITIN project is funded from the EU's INTERREG VA programme, and the funding for each financial year from the Special EU Programmes Body (SEUPB) matches expenditure claims, ensuring a breakeven position. 21. The Congenital Heart Disease network funding (\u00a3358k) is being managed by the Research & Development team, and is expected to fully spend in year. The Covid - 19 Wastewater allocation (\u00a3800k) will fund a QUB project which is analysing wastewater to help with tracking of outbreaks of Covid -19. It is also expected to fully spend in year. 22. The Capital position will continue to be kept under close review throughout the financial year. Recommendation 23. PHA Board are asked to note the PHA financial update as at December 2021. Public Health Agency Annex A - Finance Report 2021-22 Month 9 - December 2021 Year to Date Financial Position (page 2) Administration Budgets (page 5) At the end of month 8 PHA is reporting an underspend of \u00a30.8m against its profiled budget (\u00a30.8m at month 8). This underspend is primarily the result of underspends on Administration budgets (page 6), offset by some expenditure ahead of profile on Ringfenced budgets. Budget managers continue to be encouraged to closely review their profiles and financial positions to ensure the PHA meets its breakeven obligations at year-end.Approximately half of the Administration budget relates to the Directorate of Public Health, as shown in the chart below. A significant number of vacant posts remain within PHA, and this is creating slippage on the Administration budget. Management is proactively working to fill vacant posts and to ensure business needs continue to be met. Programme Budgets (pages 3&4) The chart below illustrates how the Programme budget is broken down across the main areas of expenditure. Full Year Forecast Position & Risks (page 2)PHA Financial Report - Executive Summary PHA is currently forecasting a surplus of \u00a30.4m for the full year (\u00a30.4m in month 8 report), arising from identified slippage on Administration budgets offset by pressures in other areas. The Administration and Programme budgets are being continually reviewed in order to update the full year forecast. It is also assumed that some pressures in Ringfenced areas will be used to absorb slippage in core budgets and manage the overall breakeven position. Some staff continue to be diverted to assist in PHA's response to the Covid-19 surge, and management are working to mitigate the risk of this impacting expenditure in Programme and Ringfenced budget areas. 42% 23%18%0%4% 2% 9%2% 0%PHA Programme Budgets 2021-22Health Improvement Health Protection Service Development & Screening R&D - capital R&D - revenue Operations Nursing & AHP Centre for Connected Health 19% 15% 60%1%2%3%Administration BudgetsNursing & AHP Operations Public Health PHA Board Centre for Connected Health Page 1Ringfenced Ringfenced Trust PHA Direct Trust & Direct Trust PHA Direct Trust & Sources - 31 - 1,281 1,312 - 30 - 899 929 30,875 - 928 - 31,803 PHA Direct * 53,101 11,087 - 64,187 - 35,041 6,614 - 41,655 - - 26,322 (150) (572) 1,171 450 - 285 (419) 891 757 Cumulative variance (%) 0.00% 0.81% -5.89% 4.35% 0.81% * Please a number of minor roundings may appear througout this report. * PHA Direct Programme includes amounts which may transfer to Trusts later in the yearPublic Health Agency 2021 -22 Summary Position - November 2021 The year to date financial position for the PHA shows an underspend of \u00a30.8m, which is primarily the result of underspend on Admin budgets.Annual Budget Year to Date Programme Mgt AdminTotalProgramme Mgt & AdminTotal A year-end underspend of \u00a30.4m is currently forecast (\u00a30.4m in month 8 report), primarily caused by vacancies in Admin budgets offset by managed overspends in other areas.

For example, this would include any in-year impact to PHA's normal operations from its ongoing response to Covid-19 surges (such as support to the Contact Tracing service).

He advised that he and the PHA Chair had met with the Deputy Chief Medical Officer (DCMO) to discuss the relationship between the PHA and the Department. He added that he had also attended a meeting with Ms McCaig to discuss the finance function. 42/21. 2 Workforce Plan Mr Stewart advised that he had raised this with the Chief Executive and the Chair and suggested that the need to progress this is one of the reasons the Chair is keen to get a new Committee up and running. 44/21. 16 Placement Agreements Mr Stewart noted that an update on this was provided at the last PHA Board meeting where it was clarified that if a GP practice has not returned a signed Placement Agreement, then no vaccinator staff are provided to that practice. 44/21. 17 Legal Opinion Mr Stewart advised that it was his understanding that the Junior Counsel opinion would soon be received. He said that he would wish to see this opinion as soon as possible, as well as the question asked. 44/21. 24 Rota and Timesheet Management Mr Stewart s aid that he has raised this matter with both the Chair and the Chief Executive. 56/21 Item 5 - Chair's Business 56/21.1 Mr Stewart reported that he and the PHA Chair had held a meeting with the DCMO to discuss the Internal Audit reports on the Contact Tracing Service (CTS) and the recruitment of vaccinators as both audits contained a similar recommendation about getting clarity about the relationship between PHA and the Department. In the CTS audit, he said there needed to be clarity about the ownership of the - | Page 3 | - 56/21.2 56/21.3 56/21.4 56/21.5 Service and with regard to vaccinators, there was a concern in terms of the Department issuing instructions to PHA staff which the PHA Board did not have sight of. He said that the meeting was very productive and he hoped that there would be a follow up in writing of the issues discussed. Mr Stewart advised that with regard to the CTS, the view of the Department is that the Service would have transferred fully to the PHA had it not been for the emergence of the Omicron variant. He added that given the significance of this new variant, the Department, through the Oversight Board, will retain full ownership of the Service, but the PHA is responsible for its discharge. He said that the Department spoke very highly of the work of the PHA staff involved in the Service and that the Minister, CMO and DCMO were satisfied that there was a strong CTS in Northern Ireland. He noted that there are KPIs relating to the Service and these were reported on by the Chief Executive at the last Board meeting. Turning to the audit of the recruitment of vaccinators, Mr Stewart said that there was an acceptance by the Department that due process had not been followed in terms of the approach to PHA. However, he added that the Department felt that it was lawful to instruct PHA to undertake the recruitment and employment of vaccinators because of PHA's primary duty to protect public health and life. He said that while he accepted that view, he would await the legal opinion on the matter. He reiterated that there was an acceptance that the approach was incorrect and that in future any such requests will come through the Chair and/or Chief Executive given their statutory relationships to the Minister and Permanent S ecretary respectively. He said that while the discussion was useful, he pointed out that this was not an isolated incident and that the PHA Board has been concerned for some time about PHA staff being approached directly by the Department. He advised tha t this was noted by the DCMO. He said that he would wish to see a written account of the meeting. Mr Clayton thanked Mr Stewart for the update and said that he was pleased to hear that the meeting was useful. He said that while he accepted that decisions had to be made at pace because of COVID -19, there still needs to be clear lines of accountability, command and direction. He was pleased that the DCMO has taken that on board given that this has been a concern of the PHA Board. Mr Clayton said that it is important that the PHA Board sees the legal opinion. While he accepted that the approach from - | Page 4 | - 56/21.6 56/21.7 the Department may have been lawful, he said that his concern relates more to the regulatory implications and if PHA carried out this work lawfully. Mr Stewart said that there was some discussion about the resources required for the vaccination programme going forward given the volume of vaccination that will be required, and whether PHA will need to be registered. Mr Stewart reported that he, along with the PHA Chair and Chief Executive and one of the Non- Executive Directors, had met with Ms McCaig to discuss the creation of a Director of Finance post in PHA following the migration of HSCB functions into the Department. Ms McCaig assured members that PHA finance is handled separately within HSCB and even if the functions move into the Department, the staff will remain the same and the processes will remain the same so she did not envisage any difficulties. She said that there had been a review of the information that was compiled for the previous options paper and further consideration given to the correspondence from the Permanent Secretary in terms of how his request could be delivered. She advised that she would be meeting with Mrs Paula Smyth and would t hen prepare an updated paper for the Chief Executive. She added that whatever option is chosen, she will remain committed to supporting PHA. Mr Stewart thanked Ms McCaig for her support and the openness with which this work is being carried out. Mr Stew art advised that he has asked the PHA Chair about asking one of the new Non- Executive Directors to become a member of this Committee. He said he hoped that a new member would be appointed shortly. 57/21 Item 6 - Internal Audit 57/21.1 57/21.2 Internal Audit Progress Report [GAC/ 40/12/21] Mrs McKeown gave an overview of the audit work that has been carried out so far this year. She advised that the finance audit is ongoing and that the fieldwork is due to commence in February for the audit on vaccination programmes, although it is yet to be confirmed whether this audit is do- able this year. She added that the report of the audit on Board Effectiveness is being finalised and should be ready by Christmas. She estimated that about half of the year's audit work has been completed. Mrs McKeown presented the findings of the audit on performance management and reported that a limited level of assurance was being provided with one significant finding - | Page 5 | - 57/21.3 57/21.4 in that there are significant weaknesses in this area in PHA. She said that there is no updated performance management framework in place and that no updates have been provided to the PHA Board on performance management except through the Chief Executive's Report. However, she noted that a Performance Management Report had been brought to the last PHA Board meeting. Going back to the audit findings, she said that there were no performance targets or KPIs defined for 2020/21 and there is currently no measurement and assessment of outcomes. She advised that management has accepted the recommendations of the Report. Mr Stewart said that, on reading the report, he queried whether the context took into account the situation that PHA is currently facing in that it has been in business continuity mode since early 2020 and all efforts have been directed towards deali ng with COVID -19, including taking staff away from their normal posts to deal with contact tracing with them only having recently returned to their normal roles. He added that while Non- Executive Directors are pleased to see a new Performance Management R eport having been brought to the Board, he felt that the situation PHA was facing should have been factored into the Report. Mrs McKeown said that while she appreciated those comments, she felt that there was no visibility of PHA's performance in those ar eas where work was continuing. She said that there was a need for the Report to have a sense of where performance management was across the whole organisation. Mr Clayton said that this is a significant report, not solely because of the fact that a limit ed assurance was received, but because this has been an area of concern for the PHA Board both before and during the pandemic, and is one of the reasons the Chair has been wishing to establish a new Committee. He said that the Board needs to know if the organisation is performing against its objectives and how that is measured. He noted that it is likely that PHA will be dealing with COVID -19 for many years so there is a need to be able to measure the impact of COVID -19 on other areas. He asked about KPI s and if the Board is aware of what these are. He suggested that it may be worth discussing this Report at the next Board meeting, although he acknowledged that the Chief Executive had initiated a step in the right direction by bringing a new report to th e Board. He also noted that the outcomes in PHA's Business Plan reflect those that were in the draft Programme for Government which was never formally agreed so this is an issue the Board may wish to tease out. He asked how does - | Page 6 | - 57/21.5 57/21.6 57/21. 7 57/21. 8 PHA know that it is makin g a difference, how does it measure success and how is it dealing with health inequalities? He reiterated that it may be worthwhile having a discussion at the next Board meeting and also a discussion about the new Committee. He said that this is a critical report for PHA at a critical time. Mr Stewart agreed that this is a significant report and that the Chief Executive did bring a report to the Board that addresses some of the issues. However, he said that there is a challenge for PHA in terms of being able to set objectives over which it has overall responsibility instead of objectives where it has to work with the Department or HSCB. He added that PHA needs its own identity. He agreed that the Chair will want to see the new Committee having a role in terms of performance management. He added that as the Board meetings only happen monthly and have busy agendas, this new Committee could help promote a discussion on strategic direction and bring its proposals to the Board for endorsement or amendment. Mr Murray advised that PHA is presently developing a new performance management system which will look at how PHA can report on those objectives for which it has responsibility and what influence it is having outside the organisation. He added that a new framework needs to be developed which is clear on the purpose of PHA, what is responsible for, how it will deliver that, and how it will deliver the longer term outcomes contained in strategies like, for example, Programme for Government, Making Life Bet ter and Protect Life 2. He said that systems and processes need to be developed to look at what PHA is directly accountable for, and what it is contributing to and that he has been asked to lead on this work which will be given priority over the coming months. Mr Murray advised that in terms of the audit plan for this year, an issue has been highlighted from the public health directorate about whether the audit of vaccination programmes can progress as the emergence of the new variant has impacted on thei r work. He said that the timescales will be challenging and there may need to be a look at the deliverability of this in- year which AMT will need to consider. Mr Stewart asked that AMT give this consideration and discuss it with Mrs McKeown before coming back to the Committee. He added that there was a discussion about the new variant and its implications for PHA at the meeting with the DCMO. The Chair thanked Mrs McKeown and Mr Charles for their - | Page 7 | - 57/21. 9 work on the performance management audit which he said will be used as a lever to enhance work in this area going forward. Members noted the Internal Audit Progress Report. 58/21 Item 7 - Corporate Governance 58/21.1 58/21.2 58/21.3 58/21.4 Corporate Risk Register as at 30 September 2021 [GAC/41 /12/21] Mr Stewart noted that there has been considerable work to progress some of the issues on the Corporate Risk Register. He queried whether some of the actions rated \"low\" needed to remain and whether al l of the actions rated \"high\" need to have that rating. He said that the Register needs to be reviewed in detail by the Agency Management Team (AMT). Mr Murray agreed that there needs to be a fundamental review of the Register with some risks possibly moving to directorate risk registers. He suggested that given other pressures, the Register did not receive the in- depth review that was required and but this would take place when it is next reviewed at the end of December. He advised that there is one new risk which relates to cyber security. Mr Clayton asked about risk 26 relating to procurement, and noted the new social values procurement policy that has come into being and asked whether it has implications for PHA. With regard to risk 48 on the PHA w ebsite, he noted that the website may be moving to under the NI Direct platform and he asked if this was the most appropriate and visible place for it. Turning to the new risk on cyber security, he queried the rationale for its inclusion, and whether this was due to a particular incident, or was merely a general concern. He noted that there are two risks on the Register relating to workforce pressures, one in public health and one for HSCQI, and he suggested that there should be a general risk on the Corporate Risk Register about workforce, and then a more detailed risk on the relevant directorate risk registers. He also noted the reliance on agency staff working on the PHA website and asked if there is a wider workforce issue that needs addressed. Mr S tewart said that he agreed with Mr Clayton's point about workforce issues and he would be asking Directors to review exactly where the vacancies are. He also agreed with Mr Clayton's suggestion about having a more general risk on staffing which directorat e risk registers can feed into. - | Page 8 | - 58/21.5 58/21.6 58/21.7 58/21.8 Responding to Mr Clayton's queries, Mr Murray began by advising that PHA is actively looking at the outworking of social value procurement which he said feeds into PHA's philosophy as PHA's tenders are social value based so there is a need to put in a scoring mechanism and this will be built into the planning process. In terms of the website, he advised that PHA is under the direction of the Civil Service and that all websites have to go through NI Direct, but he said he would ask Mr Wilson to come back to the Committee with more information on this. He said that the risk for PHA is the length of time it is taking to get information across to the new site. On the cyber security risk, he said that he was not aware of any specific issues, and it is more that the HSC, as a system, is ensuring that all its expertise is brought together. He agreed with the suggestion of having one risk to cover workforce. Mr Clayton said that he welcomed that social value procurement is part o f PHA's planning process and that this is a positive step. Mr Stewart commented that in risk 54 around commissioned services, it was reported that 96% of providers are delivering services fully, or with reasonable adjustments, therefore he did not feel that this was a risk. He said that while it is good that risk registers are being kept live, they should accurately reflect the current situation. He also suggested that the level of detail needs to be reviewed. Ms McCaig advised that with regard to the c yber security risk, all organisations have been reviewing their own arrangements, but this is managed centrally by the digital team. Focusing on risk 58 concerning staff resilience, Mr Stewart expressed concern that as the current pandemic shows no sign o f ending, there will be a lot of staff with a huge amount of annual leave left to take and very little opportunity to take it. He said that he would raise this with the Chief Executive. Ms McCaig said that her team has been doing a mid- point review of annual leave as this is an accrual in the accounts which will be referenced in the next Finance Report and she agreed that there is an issue as there has not been the same level of leave used so far this year. Mr Clayton said that across other HSC organisat ions staff are being approached directly to see what support arrangements can be put in place for them. He agreed that this is an issue and may be worth further discussion at next week's Board workshop. Ms McCaig said that the situation is difficult to predict given that a number of staff were redeployed to contact tracing so it is not clear whether there is an Mr Murray / Mr Wilson Mr Stewart - | Page 9 | - 58/21.9 58/21.10 58/21.11 58/21.12 58/21.13 58/21.14 opportunity for them to take leave. Members APPROVED the Corporate Risk Register. Operations Directorate Risk Register as at 30 September 2021 [GAC/42/12/21] Mr Stewart said that the Operations Directorate Risk Register was clear and to the point and he asked Mr Murray if there were any particular issues he wished to draw members' attention to. Mr Murray replied that he had no matters he wished to refer to noting that much of the work of the Operations directorate straddles the organisation as a whole so those risks would be on the Corporate Risk Register. Mr Murray noted that there had already been a discussion on the issues regarding the PHA website. He advised that there is a risk around the staffing infrastructure to support information governance. He reported that a Digital Manager will be appointed shortly to address some capacity issues and to ensure there is a smooth transition of the website to NI Direct. Mr Clayton asked about the reliance on agency staff and asked how many agency staff PHA was employing. He suggested that COVID -19 may be playing a part in terms of the recruitment process. Mr Murray agreed that there are demands on the system as a whole with the number of new posts being created and consequently there is an issue in terms of the speed with which these posts can be recruited. Furthermore, he pointed out that if an internal appointment is made, this creates another g ap. He said it can take up to six months for a recruitment exercise to be completed if an external candidate is appointed. Members APPROVED the Operations Directorate Risk Register. Update on Use of Direct Award Contracts April 2021 - September 2021 [GA C/43/12/21] Mr Stewart said that he had no particular queries on the update on Direct Award Contracts (DACs). He noted the one rated \"red\" which concerns the Lifeline service and which had been discussed at the last meeting. Ms McCaig reported that there is an element of that DAC that was not signed off by the Permanent Secretary which she is seeking clarification from DoH as to whether this will be considered as irregular spend. She advised that this is currently being - | Page 10 | - 58/21.15 58/21.16 reviewed with the Department and noted that it is a small amount. She added that the Chief Executive had indicated his wish to move away from a reliance on DACs, and she undertook to get clarity on the irregular spend in advance of the next meeting. Mr Stewart asked what the issue was with the DAC. Ms McCaig explained that as there was a delay in processing the DAC and PHA had to seek a retrospective approval for approximately \u00a35k. Mr Stewart thanked Ms McCaig for bringing this to members' attention, but noted that there are difficulties for DACs if there is only one supplier. Mr Clayton sought clarity on the use of \"user preference\" suppliers. He also noted that there appears to be an increase in the number of DACs, but he welcomed the fact that the Chief Executive is aiming to move PHA away from this approach. Ms McCaig advised that user preference can happen where perhaps a supplier has already carried out work in a particular area or that organisation is the only one that can carry out the work at that time. However, she pointed that they have all been rated \"green\" and that every DAC is reviewed by the Procurement and Logistics Service (PALS) and she reiterated the Chief Executive's wish to move away from the use of DACs. Members noted the update on the use of Direct Award Contracts. Ms McCaig 59/21 Item 8 - Any Other Business 59/21.1 59/21.2 Mr Stewart asked if the Information Governance Steering Group was continuing to meet. Mr Clayton said that as far as he was aware, meetings were still happening but he had not attended one since the summer. Mr Murray said that he would check this with Mr Wilson and Ms Karen Br aithwaite. Mr Stewart said that given the number of risks on the Corporate Risk Register relating to data, there is a need for that group to be meeting. As there was no further business Mr Stewart thanked members for their attendance and drew the meeting to a close Mr Murray 60/21 Item 9 - Details of Next Meeting Thursday 27 January 2022 at 2pm Fifth Floor Meeting Room, 12/22 Linenhall Street, Belfast. - | Page 11 | - Signed by Chair: Joseph Stewart Date: 27 January 2022 item 10 Title of Meeting PHA Board Meeting Date 17 February 2022 Title of paper Pilot Buddy Project for PHA Board Reference PHA/ 03/02/22 Prepared by Aidan Dawson Lead Director Aidan Dawson Recommendation For Approval For Noting 1 Purpose The purpose of this paper is to seek PHA Board approval for a pilot of a \"buddying\" scheme for Executive and Non- Executive Directors. The aim of the \"Board Buddy\" is to develop better understanding of Non- Executive and Executive roles across the Agency and develop a greater understanding of the work being taken in the organisation. It should also promote better working relationships through transparent and open discussions as relationships develop across the Board Room. 2 Background I nformation It has been suggested on a number of occasions in the last few months that the Board adopt a \"Buddy\" scheme as part of its management approach. 3 Proposal This proposal is to initiate a pilot where we pair Non Executive and Executive Directors for a period of six months and we ask them to meet regularly over that period. They should meet at least once a month, but may wish to meet twice a month initially to establish momentum. The pair would develop their own agenda but recognise that this is an informal mechanism. The pair would specifically discuss their own areas of work but also the wider work of the Agency. 4 Timeframe The pilot would begin, subject to Board approval, in March 2022 and run for six months to the end of August 2022. 5 Evaluation HSCQI will develop a framework for evaluation in conjunction with the Chief Executive. 6 Results Dr Aideen Keaney will bring a mid- term evaluation at June 2022 and a full eval uation report at September 2022 to the Board. 7 Pairings Area Non-Executive Director Executive Director Finance Anne Henderson Tracey McCaig Quality Deepa Mann -Kler Dr Aideen Keaney Audit / Operations Joe Stewart Stephen Wilson Public Health / Behavioural Science Professor Nichola Rooney Dr Stephen Bergin Nursing / AHPs John Patrick Clayton Rodney Morton 8 Next Steps On approval the Executive Directors will contact Non- Executive Directors with proposed dates for March 2022. item 11 Title of Meeting PHA Board Meeting Date 17 February 2022 Title of paper Update on Personal and Public Involvement Reference PHA/0 4/02/22 Prepared by Michelle Tennyson and Martin Quinn Lead Director Rodney Morton Recommendation For Approval For Noting 1 Purpose The purpose of this paper is to provide the biannual update on PHA's Personal and Public Involvement work. 2 Background Information To meet the PPI objectives within Outcomes 4 & 5 of the PHA Corporate Business Plan the PHA provides twice yearly updates to the Board on the progress of the PHA PPI Action Plan. 3 Key Issues The PHA has lead responsibility for the oversight of the implementation of PPI Policy across the HSC. In the main, the PHA manages these responsibilities by working in partnership with other HSC bodies and service users and carers through the Regional HSC PPI Forum. The PHA continues to drive forward our collective endeavours in PPI, Co- Production and Partner ship Working at a time of major flux. 4 Next Steps The next biannual Report will be brought to the Board in August 2022. 1 | P a g e Personal and Public Involvement (PPI) PHA Board Update February 2022 Personal and Public Involvement (PPI) is the active and effective involvement of services users, carers and the public in health and social care services. People have a right to be involved in and consulted on decisions that affect their health and social care. Under the Health and Social Care (HSC) Reform Act (NI) 2009, Involvement is a legislative requirement and this direction of travel is further underpinned by the Co-Production Guide of 2018. The Public Health Agency (PHA) was assigned primary responsibility for leading the implementation of PPI across the HSC system by the then DHSSPS in the 2012 PPI Policy Circular. It requires the PHA to provide the Department of Health (DoH) with assurances that HSC bodies, and in particular Trusts, meet their PPI Statutory and policy responsibilities. 2 | P a g e Report context & COVID 19 impact This update report on PPI and our work in the related areas of Co-Production and Partnership Working is in line with our Governance requirements, whereby the Board is presented with twice-yearly updates on our work in respect of the Statutory Duty of Involvement and our leadership responsibilities for the oversight of the implementation of PPI policy in the HSC. This report covers August to December 2021. It gives an overview of the developments and progress made in this field, including how we have discharged our leadership responsibilities in Involvement, Co-Production and related areas across the HSC system at a time of unprecedented change, pressure and demand. Since the last report we are delighted to confirm that after a period of change where we had a 75% staff turnover in the last year, we have moved to stabilise and strengthen the team. Bronagh Donnelly was formally recruited to the team in May 2021 as a Senior PPI Officer. This was followed in the Autumn 2021, with the recruitment of a 2nd Senior PPI Officer Emmett Lynch (supported through Transformation funds). The appointment of Martin Mc Crory to the new position of Regional Peer Mentor Lead for Service Users and Carers has further strengthened the PPI team. Martin Mc Crory joins us from WHSCT and is tasked with supporting the HSC to advance the concept and practice of engagement, support and where appropriate the remuneration of people with lived and living experience as partners in the HSC, in line with the direction of travel set out in the Co-Production Guide. 3 | P a g e Meet the team: Martin Quinn Bronagh Donnelly Emmett Lynch Roisin Kelly Martin Mc Crory Kim Conlon James Mc Laughlin Regional PPI Lead Senior PPI Officer Senior PPI Officer Senior PPI Officer Regional Peer Mentor Admin Support Admin Support Lead for Service Users & Carers The PPI team continue to support the collective effort to combat COVID-19 including: Contact Tracing COVID Vaccination communication group; Contributing to and providing professional involvement advice and guidance to projects connected to the HSC response to COVID-19, or work in the new environment created as a result of COVID and resultant societal impacts. 4 | P a g e LEADERSHIP- Influence & Impact Regional HSC PPI Forum The Regional HSC PPI Forum (the vehicle through which the PHA exercises much of its leadership in the field of Involvement and Co-Production) continued to meet throughout this period. A meeting took place on 11th October 2021 and again on 17th January 2022. The Forum drove forward several pieces of work on a collaborative basis, including the development of an updated generic Consultation Scheme Template, to enable HSC organisations to update their respective schemes (which are a legislative responsibility). The Forum was also very active in co-designing the proposed new monitoring arrangements for Involvement & Co-Production, which an anticipated implementation date of April 2022. This is a key development in being able to robustly evidence the impact of involvement and co-production across the HSC and in enabling the PHA to provide the assurances to the DoH that it is tasked with doing, in respect of HSC compliance with involvement statutory and policy responsibilities. The Regional Forum continues to review the functionality of the Forum itself and looking at how it can help progress things further in the field of Involvement, Co-Production and Partnership Working. The Forum has also committed to conducting a 'Lessons Learned' workshop and an associated report. The session which is scheduled to take place on 4th March 2022, will look at what the HSC can learn from the COVID 5 | P a g e pandemic in relation to service user and carer involvement and take forward any lessons learned for future planning. Professional advice and guidance The PHA PPI team provides professional advice and guidance on Involvement, across the HSC. This is a critical service which has continued to be in demand in the last six months, during a time of ongoing constrained capacity. The support provided varies, but in the main entails: the provision of professional involvement advice and guidance; development of monitoring arrangements practical support in helping the project promoter to secure service user/carer participation; professional involvement advice and guidance during the implementation of the work. The PPI team has provided Involvement leadership, advice and guidance across dozens of pieces of work in the HSC in the last six months, with a number being strategic high profile initiatives. A few of these are outlined: 6 | P a g e Hyponatraemia Implementation Programme (IHRD) The PHA continues to proactively support the DoH in taking forward the Involvement elements of planning around the implementation of the recommendations from the Inquiry into Hyponatraemia Related Deaths, (IHRD). Key areas of progress have been the completion of the consultation on the Duty of Candour and Being Open Policy. The PHA was instrumental in designing and guiding the undertaking of this formal consultation. It is anticipated in the new Year that the DoH will share the results of this consultation and take the outcomes from this as a basis for drafting formal guidance for the HSC and indeed legislation in respect of this, one of the most central recommendations resulting for the Public Inquiry into the Hyponatraemia Related Deaths under taken by Justice O'Hara and which will be a central plank in culture change within the HSC. The DoH are currently undertaking a stocktake of the programme, in preparation for moving into the 2nd phase, where they can sign off on a number of the recommendations and examine how best to proceed with others especially more complex ones such as the introduction of an Independent Medical Examiners service. Whilst the PHA are not supplying the day to day expertise and experience through an Involvement officer fully ensconced in the DoH, we continue to provide a \"consultancy\" type arrangement and monthly check in support and a full time admin resource to support the programme (funded by the DoH) 7 | P a g e HSC Rebuild To provide professional involvement, co-production, consultation and engagement support to the DoH Hospital Service Reform Department, one of our Senior PPI Officers has been assigned to work exclusively on this work with the DoH. Her role is to advise and facilitate best practice approaches across the directorate and within the HSC Rebuild programmes of work. The Public Health Agency continues to support the Department of Health embed best practice Involvement and Co-Production across a range of modernisation and reform projects including: The Cancer Strategy for Northern Ireland 2021-31; where an extensive co-production and involvement methodology was used in the development of the strategy and recommendations , followed by a recent public consultation and Equality Impact Assessment which included a range of stakeholder engagement methodologies. This process has involved several hundred stakeholders and included a number of engagement events with service users and carers throughout all stages. No More Silos; where involvement and co-production has been embedded with service users and carers represented at regional strategic level within the structures of No More Silos and, within the Trust operational structures including the Local Implementation Groups, work streams and the establishment of local service user 8 | P a g e and carer reference groups. This work is ongoing and includes co-produced, principles and processes, engagement events in each Trust, development of a patient ED survey and ongoing work on communication messages. In early 2022 an online patient survey will be launched, the USCRG action plan will be finalised, new members will be recruited onto the USCRG, engagement events at local level to review the progress of involvement and co-production will be held. The Review of Urgent and Emergency Care is being supported through the development of public consultation engagement methodologies and EQIA. It is expected that the public consultation will run in early 2022. The Review of General Surgery is being supported through the development of bespoke involvement methodologies to support the Programme Board and work streams. Service user and carers are integrated into the programme structure, there has been one involvement event with service users and carers, additional events are planned for 2022. Integrated Care, professional advice has been provided to the Integrated Care team in DoH, this has resulted in the establishment of a co-production group to support the engagement of service users and carers throughout the project and implementation phases. 9 | P a g e Future Planning Model Integrated Care System NI The PPI team are involved in offering support and guidance to ensure that service users and carers are involved at the formative stage of this new process. The aim of the project is to develop and implement an Integrated Care System (ICS) planning model for Northern Ireland that adheres to the principles of local level decision making with the exception of regional and specialised services planned, managed and delivered regionally. The initial phase of the project is aimed at developing and implementing an ICS model across all regions of NI operating within extant funding and accountability models, with an initial target date of 1 April 2022 for the model to be operational. The PPI team are a key contributor in these discussions and places service users and carer involvement at the centre of this piece of work. Medicine Awareness Raising Communication Working Group: This group is a sub-group of the main Regional Safer Medicines Awareness Raising Working Group. The PPI team will support and work with our colleagues to review and advise on content, 'look', and format of resources for this regional safe medicine health campaign. We will work with collective community and statutory stakeholders to agree mechanisms to promote health literacy friendly messaging to the public using a wide range of social media platforms, agree mechanisms to promote messaging and support communications colleagues in identifying professionals or public, service users / carers to participate in media outputs. 10 | P a g e Transformation Funding The PHA continues to work with HSC partners in respect of the Transformation funding from the DoH. Partnership Working Officers advancing PPI and Co-Production have been funded via the PHA and remain in place in each of the five geographically based Trusts. The funding has been secured for all five Partnership Working Officers across the region until March 2023 in the first instance, with the funding thereafter being provided on an \"assumed recurrent basis\". These roles are critical for the Trusts to be able to meet their statutory obligation to involve and they have become integral posts within each Trust. The PHA's 2nd Senior PPI Officer has been funded in this manner too and Transformation funding has also been the source for the new Regional Peer Mentor lead for Service Users and Carers who took up post on 17th January 2022. These investments are the first substantive investments in the areas of Involvement, Co-Production and Partnership Working made across the HSC system and represent a real statement of intent. There remains a big challenge for this limited number of officers in driving forward an effective cultural change in the HSC. However, with the support of Senior leaders across the system and increasing expectation of being involved by service users and carers in decisions and plans about health and social care, we are moving in the right direction. 11 | P a g e Monitoring With the investments outlined in the previous section, it is all the more important that the HSC has a robust and purposeful monitoring system for involvement. We need to know the impact that involvement and co- production makes. The So What Question? The research and evidence base is growing that effective involvement and co-production improves quality, safety, efficiency etc. It is critical however, especially when we have a system that is facing such demand and which is under pressure that we are able to evidence the difference that involvement makes and indeed that we are able to learn and transfer the learning from this approach for the benefit of those who use our services, for the befit of carers and indeed for the benefit of staff and HSC organisations. A Monitoring Task & Finish Group has been working to revamp monitoring arrangements and processes, co- designing and co-producing an updated monitoring system that is effective, that is efficient and minimises distraction from core duties, but which produces clear evidence of what interventions are happening, how that involvement / co-production is being implemented and most critically evidences the impact that is having. The group will take learning from the commissioned research, the input from all the partners, learning from other systems, with the aim of having an updated system designed and ready for implementation from April 2022. Draft Monitoring template 12 | P a g e CAPCITY BUILDING AND SUPPORT Engage website The Engage website continues to support HSC staff, service users, carers and the general public, to build their knowledge and skills on involvement. Engage remains the central source of information, good practice and resources on involvement, PPI and Co-Production. It is also somewhere that key opportunities for Involvement across the HSC continues to be promoted. In addition, it is a space where we will support and link into work on Patient Client Experience and Shared Decision Making. The PPI team have carried out an extensive review of the site and a newly revamped www.engage.hscni.net (link to current site) website will be relaunched in the Spring of 2022. The site will provide users with access to training, resources, information and support. The new dashboard analytics will enable enhanced assessments of usage, user feedback, changed behaviours and links to improved service user and carer outcomes. 13 | P a g e Involvement and Co-Production Training Whilst Covid-19 has had an impact on our training plans, the PHA have continued to promote and deliver relevant training opportunities for HSC Staff, Service Users, Carers, Community and Voluntary Sector colleagues. PHA continues to focus on commissioning specialised training for specific Involvement related areas including: Co-production and Consultation - additional 4 Webinars has been commissioned Leading in Partnership - Leadership Programme for Involvement and Co-Production this will be our 7th cohort Design and delivery of bespoke information and training for staff - including OBA training Commissioning of Executive Briefing to be rolled out throughout HSC - with our first session having been provided to PHA Executive Team in December. 14 | P a g e Co-Production and Consultation Webinar Series Following on from the success of ' PHA-,Co-Production and Consultation - Tuesday Topics, webinars delivered in Autumn 2020, and a further 2 offered in Spring 2021, we have now commissioned 4 additional webinars which will take place during January/February 2022 which will look at; What can we learn from Covid? Many HSC professionals have made heroic efforts during the pandemic to maintain the involvement of patients, clients and service users; there has been much innovation and learning. Now is the time to take stock, embed the new techniques and return to some traditional methods; join us to explore what happened, examine case studies and plan the year ahead of 'Involvement 2022'. How do we reach the 'seldom heard' and now the 'seldom online'? The acceleration of digital engagement channels and the upskilling of both HSC staff and service users have been phenomenal; but who have we left behind? Who lacks the bandwidth, confidence and competences to participate in processes that we devise, and how do we win them back as active citizens? 15 | P a g e Can the HSC contribute to mitigating the Climate Emergency? COP26 showed the tremendous importance of engaging broadly and deeply with citizens and their organisations on the Climate Emergency, if we are to build consensus around what actions we each need to take to save the planet; in this session we shall explore how to mobilise and motivate people to embrace the necessary change across the HSC family. Planning your Consultation - Ten Top Mistakes commonly made From there extensive work across these islands, the Consultation Institute has devised a helpful go-to register of the most common errors made by those planning and implementing a public consultation; it becomes a really useful checklist of what to avoid, and by implication, how to get it right first time! The interest in the Tuesday topics remains very high. As it currently stands 58 participants have registered for the first session, 75 for the second, 59 for the third and 80 for the final session. We will continue to advertise the webinars over the coming weeks and anticipate an even higher uptake. We will provide final numbers in our next report. 16 | P a g e Executive Briefing Overview This strategic briefing for senior leaders and decision-makers in the HSC was first delivered to PHA Executive Team in December 2021. It brought a focus on the statutory duty of Involvement & Consultation alongside PPI policy responsibilities and Co-Production requirements. It re-engaged the rationale for meaningful Involvement and Co-Production, giving support to senior people/managers as to how they can set direction on the culture of involvement which will permeate the organisation. It served to illustrate the importance of leading the way in terms of Involvement, Coproduction and Partnership Working and reinstating HSC commitment to its service users, carers, staff and the public. Leading in Partnership - Leadership Programme for Involvement and Co- Production As the Leaders in Partnership Programme continue to grow in demand and popularity, we are delighted to be now offering the course to our 7th cohort which will be commencing on 1st February 2022. The programme attracted 80 expressions of interest and 55 participants attended the Leaders in Partnership Information session. The programme was made available to 30 participants including HSC staff, members of the third sector and Service Users and Carers. Picture taken of Leaders in Partnership Information Session 17 | P a g e Through this programme and the other bespoke training we are able to offer, we are building a cohort of people (critical mass) in the region with knowledge, expertise and experience in involvement and co-production. In this particular cohort, we have put a particular emphasis in encouraging service users and carers to avail of this programme as a potential route into the arena of being peer mentors, whereby their time and expertise is something that the HSC look to avail of in a more formalised setting and which potentially then might attract some form of remuneration. Conclusion and next steps The challenges and pressures across the HSC that COVID has presented have meant that the PPI team have had to respond to the pressures that the system is under. The PPI team continue to help our contact tracing colleagues with staff providing support in contact tracing and data collection. As previously advised the challenges brought about by Covid-19 have meant that the PPI team, like colleagues across the HSC, have had to restructure/reimagine how we engage with people and how we conduct our business. As we look to the future and the challenges and opportunities ahead, our focus in 2022/23 will be on: 18 | P a g e How we re-engage and involve people, How we monitor How we seek to recruit new people into the world of PPI, Co-Production and Partnership Working. Our challenge remains how we will re-energise and motivate people in involvement and in strategic pieces of work, how we can show that involvement makes a difference and as the DOH carries out its review of PPI policy, how can we assist the Department in reviewing and reframing Involvement and Co-Production. item 12 Title of Meeting PHA Board Meeting Date 17 February 2022 Title of paper Performance Management Report Reference PHA/ 05/02/22 Prepared by Stephen Murray / Rossa Keegan Lead Director Stephen Wilson Recommendation For Approval For Noting 1 Purpose The purpose of this paper is to provide the PHA Board with a report on progress against the objectives set out in the PHA Annual Business Plan 2021 /22. 2 Background Information PHA's A nnual Business Plan was approved by the PHA Board in June 2021. Against this plan 53 actions were developed for 2021 /22. 3 Key Issues The attached paper provides the progress report, including RAG status, on the actions set out in the PHA Annual Business Plan 2021/22 as at 31 January 2022. Of the 53 actions: No action has been categorised as red (significantly behind target/will not be completed) 11 actions have been categorised as amber (will be completed, but with slight delay) 42 actions have been categorised as green (on target to be achieved/already completed). 4 actions that were previously green RAG status are now amber (1.10, 3.12, 4.2 and 4.5.) 4 Next Steps Work will continue against the targets in the Plan and an end-year Report will be brought to the Board early in 2022 /23. PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT REPORT Monitoring of Targets Identified in The Annual Business Plan 2021 - 2022 As at 31st January 2022 2 This report provides an update on achievement of the actions identified in the PHA Annual Business Plan 2021- 22. The updates on progress toward achievement of the actions were provided by the Lead Officers responsible for each action. There are a total of 53 actions in the Annual Business Plan. Each action has been given a RAG status as follows: On target to be achieved or already completed Will be completed, but with slight delay Significantly behind target/will not be completed Of these 53 actions 42 have been rated green, 11 as amber and 0 as red. Outcome Red Amber Green Total 1) Covid 19 Response - 3 12 15 2) Health Protection - 1 5 6 3) Health Improvement - 2 13 15 4) Shaping future health - 2 8 10 5) Our organisation works effectively - 3 4 7 Total - 11 42 53 The progress summary for each of the actions is provided in the following pages. 3 All actions for which RAG status is Amber 1. Covid 19 Response Action from Business Plan: Progress Achievability (RAG) Oct Jan Mitigating actions where performance is Amber / Red 6 Lead the Regional Infection Prevention Control Response. This will include the Development of New Managed Care IPC Network. New IPC Resource Framework, and development of professional guidance in the modelling and use of PPE Operationalise the updated Infection Protection and Control (IPC) infrastructure including anti- microbial resistance stewardship We are in the final stages of developing the Regional IPC Framework which will be shared with the Regional IPC Cell for consultation before submission to the DoH for consideration. We are in the process of Recruiting Nursing Assistant Director and Nurse Consultant for IPC and this will strengthen the PHA Directorate of Nursing IPC response. Following the submission of the Regional IPC Framework a Regional Managed Care IPC Network will be developed and will replace the current Regional IPC Cell. The Managed Care Network will be multidisciplinary and will provide an opportunity to promote consistency, standardisation and shared learning. Northern Ireland currently follows the UK Health Security Agency (formally PHE) national guidance which outlines the PPE requirements in various settings. BSO are engaged in forecasting PPE based on historical usage and volume data, through the last 3 surges. In relation to modelling, it has been agreed that it is no longer required to scientifically correlate other factors and therefore modelling PPE has been stood down. The IPC infrastructure will be operationalised when the DoH have approved the Regional IPC Framework and following development of the IPC Managed Care Network. R.Morton, Director of Nursing, Midwifery and AHPs Regional IPC Framework to be finalised and issued for consultation as soon as possible. This was delayed due to need for discussion with primary care. We aim to submit the framework to DoH by end of March following further discussion with Health Protection and at AMT 4 1. Covid 19 Response Action from Business Plan: Progress Achievability (RAG) Oct Jan Mitigating actions where performance is Amber / Red 10 Expand the routine adult and child influenza vaccines to help manage the impact of the ongoing Covid -19 pandemic. The 2021/22 influenza programme will be targeted at: people aged 50 years and over in the age based programme; School age children to year 12; and other at risk groups and HSCNI workers. The flu vaccine programme officially commenced on 4th October and is progressing for the public in GP Practices, Community Pharmacy and schools, and for health and social care workers, through the Trust Health and Social Care worker campaign, including mobile visits to Care homes, and community pharmacy. The school based childrens programme and health and social care programme is now complete. The overall programme will formally finish end of March 2022 The PHA is responsible for delivering flu vaccine uptake monitoring. In previous years monitoring was carried out using HSCB GP claim returns and auto-extraction of limited data from GP clinical systems. This year, however, a new regional Vaccine Management System (VMS) has been introduced to record COVID and flu vaccines. To date, there are issues with GP use of VMS for seasonal influenza with incomplete use of the system and difficulties recording data in a timely way (due to lack of admin support within practices): this is currently being addressed. There is a risk therefore that uptake may be reported as artificially lower than the true uptake, until the VMS is fully utilised by GPs. Public programme Uptake: As of 31st December 2021, 46% (77% year before) in over 65 year olds, 32% in 5-64 year olds, 42% under 50 year olds at risk (61% previoous year in under 65 at risk) 27% in pregnant women, 65% in school aged children 20% in 2-4 year olds - Uptake has increased in all public programme reporting groups, though still quite far off previous seasons and the S.Bergin, Director of Public Health (interim) Extensive engagement has taken place with GPs to encourage use of VMS, additional admin support has been provided, end of season uptake will be captured and VMS developments are taking place for next season to ensure more complete data. 5 1. Covid 19 Response Action from Business Plan: Progress Achievability (RAG) Oct Jan Mitigating actions where performance is Amber / Red GP claims data - . The clinical eligibility variable in VMS is poorly populated, included a count using <50 years recorded as CEV and/or underlying health condition for information. HSCW As of 31st December 2021, 36% in all Trust employed health and social care wokers This year HSCW data is limited due to limts to introduction of the VMS for Trusts. Uptake covers all hscws and can not be disaggegrated for frontline only this has been rectified for next year 14 Continue to progress quality improvement work linked to Covid learning / recovery Regional Learning System On 24th April 2020 Trust CEOs asked the HSCQI Network to provide support to Trusts and to the wider system in order to develop a regional learning system focused on lessons learned from COVID-19 to date. Harvesting of examples during a 90 day cycle resulted in regional agreement to focus the collective improvement effort on 3 key themes: virtual visiting, virtual consultations and staff psychological wellbeing. This work was supported in partnership with the ECHO team. Following discussion with strategic leaders, HSCQI carried out a literature review to identify a robust framework for scale and spread (diagram 10 appendix 1.14). This has now been Dr A. Keaney, Director HSCQI HSCQI Leadership Alliance meeting scheduled for Sept 2021 deferred awaiting appointment of new chair. New chair of HSCQI Leadership Alliance appointed November 2021.

At the HSCQI Leadership Alliance meeting on 11th November 2021 the theme of \"Timely Access\" was agreed as a regional priority for the HSCQI Network. The Hub Team are currently engaging in a series of discussions with regional leaders to identify priority areas of focus. resignation December 2021, and redeployment of 1 WTE to contact tracing in December 2021. 2. Health Protection Action from Business Plan: Progress Achievability (RAG) Sep Jan Mitigating actions where performance is Amber / Red 1 Drive increased uptake of childhood and adult preventable disease vaccines, through targeting low uptake groups. Pregnancy vaccines The HP consultant lead for pregnancy vaccines has prioritised delivery of COVID vaccine in pregnancy. Vaccine coverage has been established via NIMATS and through the analytics platform system. Progressing linkage of VMS and NIMATS data . Uptake as of end of January at delivery - 61% of women delivering in January had a least one dose of vaccine (+5% from previous month), with 56% having had two vaccines (+6%) across NI. Increases observed across Trusts on previous month with variation between Trusts narrowing (62% SET vs 55% ST) Under 30 remains lowest age group, however coverage S.Bergin, Director of Public Health (interim) Developments are taking place to improve childhood vaccine uptake monitoring through the analytics platform, which will also enable a quantitative study to identify causes of low uptake in preschool children. Engagement with 7 2. Health Protection Action from Business Plan: Progress Achievability (RAG) Sep Jan Mitigating actions where performance is Amber / Red increasing - at least 1 dose now 50% (+5%). Booster and third doses not included this month - very small numbers from NIMATS, data field only added 20th December - we will review possible inclusion in next report. Interventions - promotion materials, letter to pregnant women via Trusts, working with Trusts to establish vaccine clinics through maternity services, audio recorded midwife training slides add to website. Other children's vaccines Since prior to pandemic, preschool vaccines were falling in a small but persistent way, similar to England, especially in 12mt and 24mt age groups, and is now appearing to plateau at a lower level. It is too early to see the impact of the pandemic on uptake but early indications suggest that there has not been further decline. Further analysis to assess falling uptake is being carried out to identify causes of low uptake in preschool children. Trusts child health teams are aware and have been following up. GPs, health visitors and school nurses responsible for childhood vaccine delivery will take place following completion of COVID booster programme delivered through GP 8 3. Health Improvement Action from Business Plan: Progress Achievability (RAG) Sep Jan Mitigating actions where performance is Amber / Red 12 In line with the Nursing and Midwifery Task Group set up the infrastructure to develop a New Nursing and Public Health Nursing & Midwifery Framework Within the \u00a320m Delivering Care Investment for 21/22, in line with the NMTG, the PHA is leading on the development and establishment of a new Public Health and Population Health Nursing Network. These new roles will work with Public Health Consultants and other Public Health and Social Care Roles to ensure that prevention, early intervention and recovery are at the heart of all nursing and midwifery practices. It is also anticipated these roles will support the nursing and midwifery contribution to the development and implementation of the new NI Population Health Planning model, and will be expected to support the development of population health planning across ICS's. Trusts are making progress on recruiting their public health nurse consultants and we expected all post to be appointment by March 22. A number of regional Nurse Consultant posts are currently being progressed. R.Morton, Director of Nursing, Midwifery and AHPs The Associate Director for Public Health Nursing Post has been Job Matched and is awating DOH Approval. The work on developing a Nursing and Midwifery Public Health Nursing Framework has been delayed due the Pandemic, However the DON has now established a plan to progress theme 1 of the NMTG which is expected to now deliver by December 2022. 9 3. Health Improvement Action from Business Plan: Progress Achievability (RAG) Sep Jan Mitigating actions where performance is Amber / Red 14 Develop A Public Health Model For Homeless Services and develop a business case for the expansion of homeless health care hubs. Develop a strategic plan for the reduction of Hepatitis C and HIV through case finding, harm reduction and treatment planning The Homeless Inclusion service has now been extended to each Trust area. The Belfast Inclusion Hub will offer support to other Homeless Hub Nurses. The Homeless Inclusion teams have played an important role in Covid support to the Homeles s Sector. Whilst additional investment has now gone to each Trust to support the development of their Homeless health care services further needs assessment work is required in 22/23 ahead of a new business case for further expansion of these services. In addition the PHA will need to bid for additional staff resource to support this work Work is ongoing in relation to the HIV and Hep C outbreak, so there has been a focus on work with the highest risk groups, with an increase in testing in prisons, People who inject Drugs and people who are homeless. R.Morton, Director of Nursing, Midwifery and AHPs Additional business planning support will be sought to enable business case and strategic plan to be progressed. 10 4. Shaping future health Action from Business Plan: Progress Achievability (RAG) Sep Jan Mitigating actions where performance is Amber / Red 2 Establish a 'lived experience' network across NI and use information as a source of evidence to inform all our core activities PHA has been successful in supporting HSC organisations to encourage and facilitate those with lived experience to become more actively involved in the work of the HSC. This has been done by: Investing in the Partnership Working officers posts Appointment of Peer Mentor Lead for Service Users /Carers in PHA Initial funding in PCC to take forward work around advancing the concept and practise of remuneration of Service Users /Carers who partner with the HSC. R.Morton, Director of Nursing, Midwifery and AHPs A peer mentor programme and work plan for 22/23 is being developed. 5 Expand and develop population health intelligence resources which enable the organisation to fulfil its role in improving and protecting health and wellbeing, planning and policy development. There are two elements to this action: 1. The ongoing provision of timely and relevant evidence-based insights - the production of our existing reports has been impacted by the re-deployment of Health Intelligence Unit staff to Contact Tracing and Health Protection during this quarter. This has resulted in delays in the release of our annual official statistics reports, ie the Statistical Profile of Children's Health In Northern Ireand and the Director of Puiblic Health Core Tables Behavioural analyses completed or underway include public knowledge, attitudes and behaviours with regard to: COVID-19 and measures to mitigate it's spread; Breastfeeding: Smoking restrictions in cars; Nicotine inhalation products; Onset of stroke symptoms S.Wilson, Director of Operations (interim) Re-starting production of official statistics and accelerating development of population health analyses/resources will be possible when re-deployed Health Intelligence Unit staff return to their core duties. 11 4. Shaping future health Action from Business Plan: Progress Achievability (RAG) Sep Jan Mitigating actions where performance is Amber / Red 2. Development of our range of strategic analyses and resources to ensure they match organisational goals to reduce population health inequalities and improve population health - whilst our work on this continues, it has been slowed by the the re-deployment of staff in the Health Intelligence Unit to support Contact Tracing and Health Protection during this quarter. Population health analyses completed or underway include: People experiencing homelessness; People with addictions People bereaved through alcohol/drugs BME 5.

(when notified) DoH has written to PHA on 23rd September 2021, confirming that 'the intention will be to align ALB Corporate Plans to the next Assembly mandate (2022-2027). Although it will not be possible to have agreed plans in place for April 2022, further guidance will issue to commence this process as early as possible in the next Assembly mandate'. S.Wilson, Director of Operations (interim) PHA Business plan 21/22. will be reviewed and updated for 22/23 in line with DoH guidance to ensure key strategic 12 5. Our organisation works effectively Action from Business Plan: Progress Achievability (RAG) Sep Jan Mitigating actions where performance is Amber / Red priorities for PHA continue to be addressed. 2 Work with DoH colleagues to oversee the reform and transition of the PHA to a new operating model, taking into account lessons learned from responding to Covid 19 and manage the process of organisational change in line with further clarification from the DoH, ensuring appropriate and timely internal and external communication. Progress on this action has been delayed due to the on-going pressures and focus of senior staff both in PHA and DoH on managing the response to Omicron over the past 3 months. DoH has recently appointed a new lead officer to take this work forward and the draft PID is currently being reviewed and updated to finalise the scope of the review and agree new timelines for completion. All Directors A business cases is being finalised to secure additional dedicated resource to support this work and ensure it is completed within the revised timelines agreed. 7 Meet DoH financial, budget and reporting requirements. Financial plan approved by Board June 2021 Financial reports to DOH delivered on time on a monthly basis. Financial Reports provided on a monthly basis to AMT and Board Financial position at month 9 shows a 0.4m surplus with a number of risks to breakeven identified. Tracey McCaig Continue to monitor financial position on a monthly basis particular attention to management of the key risks and surplus towards year end 13 All actions for which RAG status is Green 1. Covid 19 Response Action from Business Plan: Progress Achievability (RAG) Oct Jan Mitigating actions where performance is Amber / Red 1 Continue to provide professional Health Protection leadership to effectively manage the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on our population. The Health Protection service has secured support and assistance from other PHA Directorates during the Covid-19 pandemic. Health Protection has also secured staff for the contact tracing service via an HSCNI workforce appeal and HSCNI recruitment service. Clinicians have also been secured via local recruitment agencies to support the contact tracing service, acute response service, care home teams and the PHA education cell. Recruitment is currently underway to enhance the Health Protection service. The Director of Public Health office/function (to address COVID) has been enhanced through the appointment of a deputy Director of Public Health The Health Protection service and contact tracing service have been supported by other PHA Directorates during the Covid-19 pandemic, most recently for the Omicron wave. S.Bergin, Director of Public Health (interim) 14 1. Covid 19 Response Action from Business Plan: Progress Achievability (RAG) Oct Jan Mitigating actions where performance is Amber / Red 2 Maintain a professional Contract Tracing service that will have the capability and capacity to respond effectively to changes in infection levels and ensure people in receipt of a positive test result are contacted as quickly as possible. Performance of the CTC has mostly been in line with agreed indicators for the year. However, the arrival of the omicron variant and the unprecedented increase in case numbers has inevitably affected performance since December. In response, an enhanced escalation plan was agreed with DoH which was based on a much reduced call script to reduce call handling time and an increased reliance on digital self trace. This purple category has been in place since December and we are working to return to our standard operational plan as quickly as possible. PHA staff were again redeployed to the Service to increase capacity. It has been agreed with DoH that the performance can not be maintained given the substantial increase in caseload. DoH requested that the Service traced all positive results obtained through LFD tests and this now accounts for more than half of the caseload. Cases have settled at a much higher volume than the pre-omicron peak - at around 4-5000 a day - and performance against the 24 and 48 hour indicators has slowly begun to improve. We continue to recruit and train new tracing staff to support the service. Additional information on performance of the service is attached as appendix 1.2 S.Bergin, Director of Public Health (interim) 15 1. Covid 19 Response Action from Business Plan: Progress Achievability (RAG) Oct Jan Mitigating actions where performance is Amber / Red 3 Ensure there is continued appropriate timely access to testing services both in Pillar 1 (HSC) and Pillar 2 (National testing service). Identification of variants of concern through timely reflex assays and whole genome sequencing of positive cases. Ongoing support for roll out of lateral flow devices across the community and in specific settings e.g. care homes, healthcare workers, education. Timely access to testing continues across Pillars 1 and 2. Up to 7th February 2022 : 5,338,967 PCRs completed 2,456,652 LFTs completed 569, 282 cases reported Procedures are in place for monitoring variants of concern through genotyping and Whole genome sequencing of samples from HSC laboratories and the national testing programs. We are currently undertaking 1000 whole genome sequencing tests per week for surveillance purposes. Lateral flow device roll out continues across multiple settings, facilitating, safer workplaces, care homes, domiciliary care, secondary healthcare, primary care organisations and schools. Various reports on testing are completed and shared as appropriate / available on request to include monthly care home reports, asymptomatic HCW staff testing LFD and LAMP. S.Bergin, Director of Public Health (interim) 4 Strengthen PHA capacity to provide the intelligence needed to meet organisational goals by supporting staff to develop their knowledge and skills; Progress has been made on this objective with further activity planned in the short term. A small data science team has been formed, using mainly temporary and external staff, which has been working with PHA analysts to support data engineering and analysis to meet PHA information needs. Modern data science infrastructure has been adopted for data engineering for several key work programmes. S.Bergin, Director of Public Health (interim) 16 1. Covid 19 Response Action from Business Plan: Progress Achievability (RAG) Oct Jan Mitigating actions where performance is Amber / Red providing tools needed to deliver intelligence effectively and efficiently; and by designing organisational and governance arrangements enabling sharing knowledge and skills across topic areas. PHA analysts have benefited from numerous online courses, seminars and conferences, relating, for example, to the application of statistical programming, automation, data visualisation, dashboarding and bioinformatics. A Future Model planning group to strengthen PHA capacity to provide intelligence was convened in December 2021 to commence a project to explore the resources, demand and capacity related to intelligence. 5 Ensure that the health protection service has robust surveillance systems in place to respond to the current Covid-19 pandemic. Review the current IT systems such as the Covid-19 surveillance dashboard and the data analytics systems. Work is ongoing to continually improve the surveillance systems and outputs with regards to COVID-19: The PHA HP Surveillance team continues to work with colleagues in the rest of the UK and ROI to support work on the COVID-19 pandemic. The HP surveillance team have been working with external colleagues (e.g. SIB, Ernst and Young, Kainos and QUB) to produce and improve reporting around Whole Genome Sequencing of COVID-19 samples, nosocomial infections of COVID-19, COVID-19 outputs. Work is continuing around developing, accessing and utilising the COVID-19 vaccination data held in the Vaccine Management System and using this data to respond to requests for information to inform multiple areas of work within the PHA and responding to requests from DoH and other external colleagues. S.Bergin, Director of Public Health (interim) 17 1. Covid 19 Response Action from Business Plan: Progress Achievability (RAG) Oct Jan Mitigating actions where performance is Amber / Red The contact tracing service now produces a range of reports to assist in monitoring and managing the Covid-19 pandemic: Weekly performance metrics (https://www.publichealth.hscni.net/covid-19-coronavirus/testing-and- tracing-covid-19/contact-tracing-service-management-information) Weekly cluster reports Weekly data on schools (https://www.publichealth.hscni.net/publications/coronavirus-bulletin ) Educaion to assist School cell risk assessemnts. CT Huddle Dashboard (produced 3 times daily and circulated to Senior PHA team - summary headline numbers on cases and contacts and key performance measures), and a Daily report circulated to Senior PHA team with detailed measures of call numbers, performance e.g. 24/48/72 age breakdown, % using Digital self-trace etc.) Reports are used for a range of purposes, such as: Daily CTC report - to inform CT Program Board of current cases levels, trends and perforamnce to seek to identify common exposure settings (e.g. workplaces), to provide a twice weekly multi-disciplinary Covid overview (assessing HP Surveillance data, schools data and estimated transmission patterns data from a number of sources (Virology database, cluster data from CTC etc.)), a 2-Weekly Travel Report (summary of cases for DOH Travel 18 1.

The PHA has continued to provide detailed Health protection advice to a range of professional audiences - eg. the School's team worked extensively with DE, EA and Trade Unions to implement the outworking of the change in policy regarding close contacts definition in Education settings. In addition the acute Duty Room team provides advice across a wide range of settings, both HSC and non HSC settings (eg. wider public sector, private/commercial sector, and to other individual organisations and groups). This input and advice is provided on a seven day basis with a 24/7 on call service to encompass the full weekly period. The Public Health team continues to provide expert advice to DoH strategic programme Boards including, Testing, Tracing and Vaccination and is also contributing to specialist cells eg. Modelling. A Health protection guidance cell provides evidence based advice to a range of partner organisations and the Health protection team continues to facilitate management of outbreak situations. The availability of clear, accurate and up to date public and professional communications has been of paramount importance at each stage of the Pandemic and the Agency's Communications team continues to ensure that appropriate communications are delivered on a timely and effective basis meeting the specific S.Bergin, Director of Public Health (interim) / S.Wilson, Director of Operations (interim) 19 1.

This has included publications and online information for various audiences as COVID, COVID information and policy altered eg health care workers, care homes, EA and schools. 8 Rebuild the screening programmes post COVID to ensure that services are operating to the standard required and that capacity for all programmes is maximised to ensure as many people as possible from the target populations are able to access services All screening programmes impacted by Covid continue to build capacity and reduce delays for screening invites. The current position across each screening programme is below and more detail is available at Appendix 1.8 Bowel cancer screening: The delay in routine invitations is currently 20 weeks (reduced from 29 weeks). The catch up exercise will be completed by August 2022. Breast screening: The round length is currently an average of 38 months. This is down from 41 months in September 2020 (although it remains above the standard of 36 months). This is being achieved through the provision of additional screening clinics. Progress will not be linear as it is dependent upon the continued availability of staff. Cervical screening: The programme continues to operate with a 5 month delay in routine invitations, but activity has returned to pre-covid levels. Diabetic eye screening: The programme continues to use a risk stratified approach to invite individuals for screening. Additional in year funding was secured via the June monitoring review to support recovery, and further expansion of capacity is being taken S.Bergin, Director of Public Health (interim) 20 1. Covid 19 Response Action from Business Plan: Progress Achievability (RAG) Oct Jan Mitigating actions where performance is Amber / Red forward with the Trust to move towards reintroducing routine screening. This programme has faced significant logistical challenges due to the impact of covid. As well as a reduced patient throughput required for infection control purposes, programme has had to develop a new model of service delivery. AAA screening: Surveillance scanning for men with small/medium AAA is operating as normal. Approximately 72% of men in the 20/21 cohort for primary screening have now been called for their initial appointment. 9 Continue to support the roll out of the Covid 19 Vaccination programme and any subsequent booster programmes and ensure that action is taken to improve uptake rates for vulnerable populations or in specific localities where uptake is low All PHA Directorates continue to support roll out of the programme, currently led by the Department of Health including Public Health Direcotate Health Protection and Health Improvement Divisions, Operations Directorate, communications and the Nursing Directorate. PHA Lead on the following aspects of implenetation: Implementation of children;s COVID vaccine: 12-15 year olds have been introduced intitial through school programme and now through Trust clinics. 5-11 year olds in at risk groups has recently been launched through trust clinics, Overall uptake for dose one 52% Implementation of COVID vaccine in pregnancy: increasing uptake, better provision of uptake data and increased promotion, January coverage at delivery - 61% of women delivering in January had a least one dose of vaccine (+5% from previous month), with 56% having had two vaccines (+6%) across NI.

Delivery and responsibility for COVID vaccine programme will transisition to PHA from start of the 2022-23 financial year. DPH and AD of Health Protection are identifying required infrastructure to enable this. 11 Ensure Incident Management Teams are established to effectively manage outbreaks, especially in responding to clusters and new variants, to minimise the potential for wide spread infection. The Health Protection service continues to provide expert advice and support to all stakeholders in relation to new Covid-19 variants and clusters. Health Protection consultants also provide advice and support to Trusts and external stakeholders by joining IMT's and outbreak control management teams to ensure the health and wellbeing of the N. Ireland population. This includes establishing and chairing Incident Management Teams to effectively manage outbreaks and clusters, including in response to new variants of concern.

PHA continues to work with DoH and HSCB colleagues to ensure a population health Planning approach is embedded into new organisational structures being designed to support an Integrated Care System. The draft Framework document for establishing a new planning model is currently being reviewed and updated to take into account comments received from the consultation process. PHA is represented on the Project Board and various project planning teams that have been established to take forward the implementation of a new planning model for HSC. All Directors 3 Support the development of multi- disciplinary strategic Planning teams that will agree future priorities for the agency on specific thematic areas, starting with an initial planning team to look at Mental and Emotional Wellbeing, Suicide Prevention and Drugs and Alcohol AMT agreed the establishment of a Mental Health, Emotional Wellbeing and Suicide Prevention Multi-disciplinary strategic planning team in July 2021. The first meeting of the Team took place on 30th November 2021 where the ToR was agreed and the next steps including a workshop to determine an action plan to take place in early 2022. Work was also initiated in July 2021, with HSCB colleagues, to establish a Multi-disciplinary planning team to take forward the new Drug and Alcohol Substance Misuse Strategy. This work was delayed but the first meeting has now taken place. Work is now being progressed to look at further developing multi-disciplinary strategic planning teams within PHA and how such teams would support the new Planning Model currently being developed by DoH.

This has been delayed by 1 month due to the necessary response to COVID-19. Plans on how to launch the guidance are currently being developed and will take into consideration necessary timings relating to the implementation of the new planning model. S.Wilson, Director of Operations (interim) 6 Support DoH colleagues to ensure that public health policy is embedded in the development and delivery of Programme for Government eg transport, housing, air quality, greenways, economic development. Further to the public consultation on the draft outcomes framework for PfG that closed at the end of March 2021, PHA officers continue to support DoH colleagues in public health policy discussions, when approached for input. S.Bergin, Director of Public Health (interim) 7 Continue to work with each of the Local Councils and their Community Planning Partnerships to take forward implementation of agreed action plans. PHA has continued to work collaboratively with local councils and Community Planning Partnerships to take forward agreed actions. Since April 2021, the key focus has continued to be on working collectively to develop and deliver programmes aimed at supporting those most affected by Covid 19. This has included supporting vulnerable families and individuals with direct assistance; addressing issues of social isolation for older people and promoting programmes aimed at improving mental health and well-being.

PHA Corporate and Public Affairs has undertaken a sustained programme of messaging and content development on both COVID-19 and non-COVID issues, striking a balance between the ongoing priorities and pressures of managing the pandemic, aligned with the priorities of the agency. Between 1 October 2021 and 30 December the agency reached 5,623,831 individual people organically (ie without paid promotion) through Facebook, reflecting how the programme of social messaging is resonated beyond the jurisdiction, with the highest reach on 7 November (2,285,686). This has run in parallel with proactive messaging through the mainstream media - 32 news releases were issued in this period on issues as diverse as breast cancer, mental health, STIs, avian flu, button cell battery safety and alcohol consumption, on top of a range of COVID- related topics and changing advice on issues such as testing, symptoms, schools, contact tracing and general advice. With this has come a significant requirement to manage media. Corporate and Public Affairs also undertook a sustained programme of proactive multi-channel, multi-format messaging in the six weeks leading up to Christmas and New Year under the title 'Stay Safe This Christmas' encouraging people to remain cautious and take appropriate steps to help avoid getting COVID- 19, given the time of year and likely increase in social activity.

Scope baseline QI capability across all PHA - HSCQI have completed a scoping exercise with HSC Trusts to identify QI trained staff (aligned with the Q2020 Attributes Framework) from across the region. In the next quarter of 2021/22, HSCQI will extend the scoping exercise across all PHA Directorates to obtain baseline data for the organisation for future planning of the PHA Quality and Improvement strategy. Scoping template for PHA developed and currently being tested by one division. Next steps: Roll out of scoping template to all Directorates in PHA. Aim to have this completed by end of quarter 4. Scope Quality Improvement training for Boards In accordance with the Q2020 Attributes framework Level 4 QI training should be offered to staff who are charged with leading QI across organisations and the HSC system. These individuals are also responsible for ensuring QI is embedded in the day to day work of their organisation. The HSCQI Hub team are currently exploring options with a range of potential suppliers. Dr A Keaney, Director HSCQI 52 4.

The All Party Group Report on 'Reducing Harm related to Gambling' includes recommendations on legislation, regulations and media and PHA will contribute to DOH input, as relevant, on the Department of Community led Inter-Departmental Group. PHA made a submission and presentation to the Committee of Communities raising specific concerns on the draft gambling legislation being introduced by the Department of Communities. That submission represented detailed evidence and research about the increased prevelance of gambling amoung young people and increased numbers of those experiencing gambling harms. Additional consideration of impact of increased opening days for Betting Shops in NI and option for application of a Gambling Levy to pay for prevention and treatment services on gambling harm were raised. DOH are requesting PHA support on actively considering how local evidence and research on local need in this area could be secured. The Young People's Covid Messaging Group (YPCMG) was established by PHA to specifically engage with, support and platform appropriate COVID-19 public health messaging for young people. Following the completion of the school nursing vaccination programme, YPCMG have been involved reviewing COVID vaccination uptake in 12-17yr olds. YPCMG members are leading on engagement and data collection to identify vaccine hesitation and barriers to uptake faced by young people. When requested, the YPCMG also support engagement and S.Bergin, Director of Public Health (interim) 53 4.

In particular, from June - Oct circa 70 WTE additional Band 6 staff have been employed to enhance the Contact tracing service (including support provided to education facilities) to enable it to manage the increase in demand. PHA currently employs 606 staff with a whole time equivalent of 514.59. This is an increase from 443 (388.79 WTE) staff at the same point last year and reflects additional staff employed by the PHA for contact tracing and vaccination. Sickness absence was 2.56% at the end of the period comparing to 2.12% at the same time last year. All Directors 4 Scope out accommodation requirements to allow staff to return to work safely in line with Covid 19 guidelines and work with BSO colleagues to develop appropriate policies and procedures to facilitate new working arrangements The PHA worked with BSO colleagues to ensure that safety inspections were completed in all offices and that appropriate measures were in place for staff safety during the pandemic. Policies and procedures for new working arrangements are being developed regionally and the PHA will implement these when they are published. A \"Report on a Review of the Accommodation Needs for the Public Health Agency\" has been completed and a number of recommendations were made. Implementation of these recommendations has been delayed due to the prioritisation of the covid response, but Terms of Reference have been drafted for an Accommodation Project Board to take these forward.

Although the COVID response has delayed progress, work is underway to develop an outcomes based performance management and reporting system across PHA. OBA style reporting is in place already or is currently developing across a number of work areas and work continues to build organisational capacity. Work had started in 2019/20 to refocus business planning and performance management reporting around an outcomes based approach and a review of corporate performance documents is also now taking place to build on and progress this work. A draft framework is in development and a focus on impact and OBA style working will also be at the core of the development of the annual business plan 2022/23. Corporately, we have developed and agreed our strategic alignment across key strategic documents and illustrated this using the golden thread. A draft strategic outcomes framework is also underway for use within the outcomes based performance framework. AMT approved the development of a strategic planning team for mental health in July 2021. This team met for their first meeting in November 2021 and agreed their ToR and next steps. This group will act as a prototype for future teams and work has S.Wilson, Director of Operations (interim) 56 5. Our organisation works effectively Action from Business Plan: Progress Achievability (RAG) Sep Jan Mitigating actions where performance is Amber / Red begun to identify key thematic areas that would find the SPT model effective. 6 Build organisational knowledge and capacity of Outcome Based Accountability (OBA) OBA style reporting is in place already or is currently developing across a number of work areas such as Family Nurse Partnership and others are developing outcomes frameworks e.g. PL2 implementation. As well as implementing OBA style reporting to build capacity and knowledge, the focus this year so far has been on promoting the 'golden thread' illustration of PHA's strategic alignment and the outcomes across a number of strategies that PHA contribute to. As well as providing support to new areas implementing OBA. A focus on impact and OBA style working will also be at the core of the development of the annual business plan 2022/23 Work is underway to arrange a series of OBA awareness sessions in 2022.

The current position across each programme is below: Bowel cancer screening: The delay in routine invitations is currently 23 weeks (reduced from 29 weeks). The catch up exercise will be completed by August 2022. No. of individuals with a completed screening test result 2021 activity as a % of 2019 activity 2019/20 2021/22 Quarter 1 (April - June) 22,398 22,703 101.4% *note the type of screening test used in the programme changed from January 2021.The above numbers can reflect invites/test kits that were sent out several months prior. Breast screening: The round length is currently 38 months. This is down from 41 months in September 2020 (although it remains above the standard of 36 months). This is being achieved through the provision of additional screening clinics. Progress will not be linear as it is dependent upon the continued availability of staff. July- Sept 2019 July- Sept 2021 2021 activity as a % of 2019 activity No of women invited 19,533 21,976 113% No of women screened (71% uptake) 103.2% 64 Cervical screening: The programme continues to operate with a 5 month delay in routine invitations with a formal catch up programme not likely to be feasible. Ongoing pressures are noted in relation to turnaround times for lab results and some colposcopy services. The number of screening samples received by the labs provides an indication of activity for women being screened. This figure is dependent on the number of women due for screening at a given time, the availability of appointments at GP practices, and the uptake by women, so it is subject to fluctuation. No. of cervical samples taken (as recorded received at a NI laboratory) 2021 samples taken as a % of 2019 samples 2019/20 2021/22 Quarter 1 (April - June) 31,668 27,939 88.2% Diabetic eye screening: The programme continues to use a risk stratified approach to invite individuals for screening. Additional in year funding was secured via the June monitoring review to support recovery, and further expansion of capacity is being taken forward with the Trust to move towards reintroducing routine screening. This programme has faced significant logistical challenges due to the impact of covid. As well as a reduced patient throughput required for infection control purposes, programme has had to develop a new model of service delivery. No. of people screened 2021 activity as a % of 2019 activity 2019/20 2021/22 Quarter 1 (April - June) 12,459 6,539 52.5% AAA screening: Surveillance scanning for men with small/medium AAA is operating as normal. Approximately 56% of men in the 20/21 cohort for primary screening have now been called for their initial appointment. No. of appointments completed 2021 activity as a % of 2019 activity 2019/20 2021/22 Quarter 2 (July - Sept) 1,794 2,134 119% 65 Appendix 1.14 - HSQQI On 24th April 2020 Trust CEOs asked the HSCQI Network to provide support to Trusts and to the wider system in order to develop a regional learning system focused on lessons learned from Covid-19 to date. During weekly meetings with QI Leads (May and June 2020) HSCQI members from across the system explored the core components of a learning system, depicted in Diagram 1(Amar Shah, Chief Quality Officer at East London Foundation Trust). This diagram has been used to assess the readiness of HSCQI as a regional learning system. Diagram 1: Core components of a learning system. Diagram Credit: Amar Shah, ELFT 2019 Using the structure of a 90 day learning cycle the HSCQI Network continued with these weekly meetings. A number of regional workshops were designed to identify a wide range of learning. Attendance at each of the meetings and workshops and the diversity of attendees is shown below in Diagram 2. Harvesting of examples during the 90 day cycle resulted in regional agreement to focus the collective improvement effort on 3 key areas: virtual visiting, virtual consultations and staff psychological wellbeing. QI Science Literature Mandate - HSCQI Leadership Alliance HSCQI hub and spoke HSCQI Leadership Alliance Other stakeholders Local and regional data - Quantitative & Qualitative HSCQI ECHO Structured learning sets Life QI 66 Work streams for each of these 3 themes were established with representation from across the HSCQI network. To support this work the HSCQI Hub partnered with the Regional ECHO team to co-deliver monthly HSCQI learning sessions. Diagram 3 shows attendance numbers at each of the 7 sessions held between November 2020 and June 2021. The ECHO/HSCQI learning sessions were paused early June due to PHA Covid-19 pressures. Virtual Visiting: The scale and spread of virtual visiting across Trusts during 2020/21 during the COVID 19 pandemic has been a real success story, accelerated by the focus of HSCQI and of the HSCQI Leadership Alliance. Quality Improvement Teams from across the region engaged with HSCQI and collected data on activity as displayed below looking at the number of participating wards and uptake of virtual visiting slots. These QI teams used run and SPC charts Diagram 2: Attendance at HSCQI Network meetings/workshops Diagram 3: ECHO session attendance 67 to tell the story and show their tests of change. Examples of QI data collected from one of these teams shown in the appendix - diagrams 4 and 5. In addition to this quantitative data, QI teams also asked service users, families and staff for feedback to inform change and service development. To explore the regional picture, HSCQI partnered with the Regional Care Opinion Team to get regional feedback. This feedback is shown in diagrams 6 and 7. Following agreement with the HSCQI Leadership Alliance in June 2021, responsibility for sustaining virtual visiting now sits locally with Trusts, with regular \"check-ins\" from the HSCQI Hub to ensure sustainability. Staff psychological wellbeing: A number of examples of initiatives to support staff psychological wellbeing during the first wave of Covid-19 were harvested. Given the scope of this work, this workstram connected with other regional groups, for example colleagues in the Public Health Agency Staff Wellbeing group and with the DoH Regional Staff Health and Wellbeing group. Work has been progressed through all of these groups to develop a regional infographic and animation to promote the 'Bridge to Recovery' message for staff - diagram 8. Diagram 4 Diagram 5 Diagram 6 Diagram 7 Diagram 8 68 Virtual Consultations All Trusts have made progress in this area with many developing local guidance. Through the HSCQI Learning System sub group many are beginning to focus on data and measures to demonstrate the effectiveness or \"quality\" of Virtual Consultations. Measures being progressed through the virtual consultations work stream include: 1. Patient or service user feedback 2. Staff Feedback 3. The number of virtual consultations offered and the number of consultations that actually took place. Diagram 9 shows regional virtual activity between January and June 2021. Framework for scale up: In order to support regional scale and spread within these learning themes, HSCQI carried out a literature review to identify a robust framework for scale and spread. A proposed framework has been discussed with QI Leads and the HSCQI Leadership Alliance. If endorsed, this regional scale up framework will become an integral part of HSCQI Learning System going forward.
