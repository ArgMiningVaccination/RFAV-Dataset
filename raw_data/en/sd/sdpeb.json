Hogue Becomes LLUSP Dean theCAPSULETHE CAPSULE 2019 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF PHARMACY2 3Dear Readers, Recently, Loma Linda University School of Pharmacy (LLUSP) held its fourteenth Commencement ceremony which, in spite of the misty rain, was a beautiful event. Members of the Class of 2019, clad in regalia, orchid leis and dollar bill chains, were riding high as they received their diplomas and awards and celebrated with their loved ones. It is the climax of the academic year and will, undoubtedly, be remembered as one of the highpoints in the lives of our graduates. This 2019 edition of The Capsule includes highpoints our alumni, faculty, staff and students have experienced as well as updates on the impressive things happening at our school. Like Commencement, it's all very exciting and remarkable. But I've been thinking about the \"off-times,\" the Wednesdays, the lows that inevitably come when the reality of normal day-to-day living sets in. What do we do when work isn't exciting, a promotion isn't imminent, and no one is doling out accolades? The apostle Paul wrote, \"Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for human masters\" (Colossians 3:23). When work and life become routine, do them with passion. Mundane tasks must be done in order to achieve the significant, and one can still glorify the Father in the way each job is accomplished. Look for opportunities to serve others because even though it may not earn you an award, God will be so pleased!

Hogue, FAPhA, FNAP. It is a role to which he has long felt called, and he believes LLUSP is right where God wants him to be.RAISED TO BELIEVE AND TRUST Dr. Hogue was born and raised in a rural area of southern Illinois. Because there is no industry for miles around, the community has struggled for decades with unemployment and poverty. Dr. Hogue, however, recalls that God was faithful and provided unexpected work and finances for his parents. His mother worked as the deputy circuit clerk in the county and knew, literally, everyone in their community. His father came from a family of brick-masons, so after serving in the Air Force, his dad went straight into the business of brick- laying. In the 1970s, when interest rates hiked and many builders struggled to find work because people could not afford to build new homes, Dr. Hogue's father, uncle and grandfather were hired to lay brick for a new prison being constructed in a nearby town. When that job ended, Dr. Hogue's father got a job as a guard at the new prison, where he worked for another 30 years. Because of its proximity to his home in Illinois and because he desired to study at a Christian school, Dr. Hogue attend Samford University in Birmingham, Alabama, where he earned both his BS and PharmD degrees. In pharmacy school, he met his wife, Heather. After graduation, both began their careers as pharmacists and then took on the even greater responsibility of parenting two daughters \u2014 Olivia, 19 and a freshman at Samford University, and Anne Elise, a 16-year-old high school sophomore. THE JOURNEY TO BECOMING DEAN Dr. Hogue was hired into an ambulatory care faculty position as an assistant professor at Samford University's McWhorter School of Pharmacy. When an unexpected vacancy arose in the Experiential Education Division, he was asked to step in as chair. After two days of filling in, he told the School Dean, \"Look, if I have to learn this job all the way in order to do it on a temporary basis, then let me have it permanently. I can't just wet my toe; I need to really get in here and do the work.\" The Dean was happy with that, and Dr. Hogue found himself taking on something he hadn't even applied for. He recalls that leading that division was the most difficult role he's had in a pharmacy school. \"You're dealing with all of the faculty and all of the students and then you layer on to that all of the preceptors and all of the site requirements. It's a very complex juggling act.\" After serving as the Director of Experiential Education for three years, he moved into the position of Chair for the Department of Pharmacy Practice where he enjoyed helping faculty members develop their skills and identify the next steps in their individual career paths. Several years later, the Dean retired, and the university president asked Dr. Hogue to serve as the interim-dean. \"I really felt then that God's purpose for me was to be dean. I can't explain all the details, but I was completely convinced that it was my calling,\" he remembers. Instead, he was utterly confused when he was not selected to be dean for Samford's pharmacy school. He returned to his previous work as Chair of the pharmacy practice department; but at the end of the academic year, he came to the conclusion that it was time to do something different. Although he wasn't sure what \"different\" was, he stepped out in faith and announced his resignation. Shortly thereafter, Samford's vice-provost approached Dr. Hogue about starting a new Center for Faith and Health. He immediately felt attracted to the work, as it would afford him a unique opportunity to work with the colleges of pharmacy, nursing, public health and allied health to integrate the university's Christian mission into their educational programming. \"Faith has always been a critical part of my ethos, my day-to-day; it's who I am. I believe we are here to serve Him. So, while DR. MICHAEL D. HOGUE: CALLED TO BE DEAN By Jen Mathew, MATHE CAPSULE 2019 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF PHARMACY6 7 SCHOOL NEWS Since August 2018, representatives from the Loma Linda University School of Pharmacy (LLUSP) and the pharmacy department at Loma Linda University Medical Center (LLUMC) have met on a monthly basis to collaborate. The meetings provide opportunities for professors from the school and rotation preceptors at the hospital to discuss hospital-based pharmacy practice, the best teaching practices and student progress. The idea of a joint meeting grew out of discussions with medical center pharmacists and clinical practice faculty. Both groups expressed a desire for more occasions to communicate face-to-face with their colleagues across campus. Antony Gobin, PharmD, MBA, (LLUSP Class of 2007) Director of Pharmacy at the medical center, was invited to the school to discuss various pharmacy education issues with members of the Departments of Pharmacy Practice and Experiential Education. Once the monthly meetings were established both Darryl VandenBosch, CPA, Vice President for Adult Services at LLUMC, and Adrian Cotton, MD, Chief of Medical Operations for Loma Linda University Health Hospitals, wished to join. Their unique perspectives and networks make for well-rounded conversations and innovative suggestions during the meetings. Dr. Gobin typically brings several different pharmacists from the medical center with him to each of the meetings. The pharmacists, who act as official preceptors for students on rotations, attend on a rotating basis and provide insight into experiential learning in areas such as pediatrics, pharmacy administration, critical care, and hospital practice.From the school, Dan Brown, PharmD, Chair of the Department of Pharmacy Practice, attends the meetings along with a pharmacy practice faculty member, Lisa Hong, PharmD, BCPS. In addition, the Department of Experiential and Continuing Education is represented by its PharmD, BCPS, and Farnoosh Zough, PharmD, BCPS, Director Introductory Pharmacy Practice Experience. According to Dr. Brown, \"[We] have opened channels of communication that enable leaders from the hospital and the school to explore creative strategies whereby pharmacy students can be more directly engaged in the patient care mission of the hospital while achieving valuable learning outcomes. It's a win/win relationship that grows stronger with every meeting. One recent development is a plan for 4th-year pharmacy students to play a significant role in counseling inpatients about medications prior to discharge, under the supervision of a pharmacist preceptor.\" In addition, topics covered have included improved communication about events and activities at the two sites as well as an orientation checklist for P2 students and preceptors. Students, faculty and medical center preceptors agree on the usefulness and productivity resulting from the meetings. As Dr. Gobin says, \"The meetings have been beneficial. We invite different preceptors from all of our Loma Linda hospitals to let us know what works and in what areas we can improve. I think the meetings have been productive because the school and all of the LLU pharmacies have the same objective, and all parties want to provide a quality education for the students.MEETINGS OF THE MINDS: LLUSP AND LLUMC COLLABORATE TO IMPROVE STUDENT OUTCOMES By Jen Mathew, MAI am loyal to my employer, and I am loyal to the people I work with, it's the Lord I really work for. I knew I had to take the job.\" As Associate Dean for the Center for Faith and Health, he was involved in coordinating global engagement opportunities for students (such as mission trips), as well as organizing weekly worship services and spiritual life conferences to connect the concept of calling into one's day-to-day work. In the meantime, he was contacted by several universities looking for deans but dismissed them all because they never seemed quite right to him \u2014 until the Loma Linda University recruiters called. They reached out to Dr. Hogue with a very personal message saying that because of his faith background, they believed he would be a good fit for the dean's position at its School of Pharmacy. No other institution's recruiters had mentioned his faith. It immediately got his attention. When he discussed it with his family, it got their attention, too, and they advised him to earnestly consider the opportunity. Perhaps not coincidentally, Dr. Hogue was scheduled to give a presentation in Palm Springs a few weeks later. While he was there, he figured he might as well pay the LLU campus a visit and contacted HR to request a tour. \"I remember it was 110 degrees outside, sunny and hot. After a meeting with Dr. Hart, I walked out of Magan Hall, faced Centennial Complex with all the mountains in the background, and had this overwhelming sense that I was home. It might sound supernatural \u2014 actually, it was supernatural. I knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that I was supposed to be here ... And I hadn't even been interviewed by the search committee yet!\" he laughs. Dr. Hogue anticipated challenges, but the Lord opened doors and continued to make it clear to him that LLUSP was where he was meant to be. And he realized the Lord truly had called him to be Dean. God had been preparing him for it all along.\"Sometimes when we hear or feel the Lord calling us to something, we believe it will come together immediately because we think of our timeline, planning everything out according to our own needs and desires. But that's not God's timing; His timing is different.\" IMPRESSIONS OF SCHOOL AND UNIVERSITY When Dr. Hogue arrived as Dean, he wondered what kind of people he would inherit \u2014 would they be a group of employees and students who wanted to be here or who were here reluctantly? He was relieved to find that, by and large, people want to be here. He sensed early on that there are administrators, faculty, and staff who are tremendously committed to the institution and passionate about Loma Linda's mission. That's impressive to him. \"I'm excited about our faculty and staff, who are well-qualified and well-credentialed and pursue education with excellence and yet, they have a genuine desire to do even better, no matter how good they already are. Everyone has opportunities to improve, and we've got to be hungry for growth. We must be in a constant moving- forward mode.\" He's also impressed by the diversity in the School of Pharmacy and the way people from various backgrounds have come together and strongly support the same vision and mission. Dr. Hogue finds the LLU mission extraordinarily helpful in focusing our work -- it reminds everyone that this is an academic institution preparing people to be pharmacists equipped with the knowledge, skills and abilities to take the best care of patients and to be the hands of Christ. The mission also imparts on students a deeper sense of caring, he says. \"It's not that secular schools of pharmacy don't try to impart concepts of care on their students, but when we do it from a context of our soul, our purpose, there is something different about the way individuals perceive their human relationships. To say 'I care' means something more because through Christ, we can truly love others. The care we give isn't transactional; it's personal.\" PLANS FOR MOVING FORWARD Simply put, Dr. Hogue wants LLUSP to be the number one private Christian pharmacy school in the nation. He doesn't want the title for bragging rights but to give the School something to shoot for. A goal -- something people aspire to -- must be articulated. Dr. Hogue recalls that God gave His very best when he gave Jesus to die for humanity. How, then, can LLUSP, as a group of people who believe in continuing the ministry of Jesus Christ, settle for anything other than giving their very best to God? It is not for our own glory, he insists, but for God's that LLUSP should strive to be the best truly evangelical pharmacy school in the U.S. \"I believe we can get there. It takes time to develop reputation. You can purchase awareness and even recognition, but reputation has to be earned. It will take years of us engaging completely and fully in being our very best. I'm not just chasing after ranking; I'm chasing after excellence.\" Perhaps this is why God called Michael Hogue to LLUSP.I walked out of Magan Hall, faced Centennial Complex,with all the mountains in the background, and had this overwhelming sense that I was home.\" L to R: Darryl VandenBosch, CPA; Daniel Brown, UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF PHARMACY8 9 SCHOOL NEWSAbout seven years after graduating from Sahmyook University (SYU) in South Korea, I had the privilege of re-visiting my alma mater from March 5-7, 2019, together with Dean Michael Hogue, PharmD, FAPhA, Assistant Professor Soo-Min Jang, PharmD. During this three-day affair, we toured the vibrant and technologically advanced campus of SYU, met and interacted with the President, the Director of the International Education Center (IEC) of SYU, the Dean, and my former mentors at its School of Pharmacy. PY4 students Samuel Yang and Anthony Joo, who were on rotations in Korea during our visit, also joined us in our activities. In our meeting with the SYU President and the Director of IEC, Dean Hogue discussed the possibility of collaborating with SYU on pharmacy educational initiatives, developing a memorandum of understanding related to a summer training program, and designing an expeditious pathway for the chemistry and biology majors of SYU to pursue PharmD degrees at LLUSP. During the Joint Research Symposium organized by the faculty members of SYU School of Pharmacy, Drs. Jang and I shared our current research activities, learned about the research accomplishments of the faculty members of SYU School of Pharmacy, and identified areas for collaborative research. In her opening remarks during the research symposium, Dr. Choi Sung Suk, Dean of the SYU School of Pharmacy, stated \"This [symposium] is held in commemoration of the 40th anniversary of the College of Pharmacy, which was established in 1979 and will hopefully be held regularly to commemorate the progress of our collaborative research with LLU School of Pharmacy.\" Dean Hogue made clear his support of research collaboration between the two institutions and his hopes that the symposium will be conducted on a regular basis. Aside from the SYU visit, we were also granted the opportunity to explore other remarkable establishments in South Korea, courtesy of Dr. Jae Wook Yang, Professor at SYU School of Pharmacy. During the last leg of our trip, we visited Samsung Medical Center, a 1,979-bed hospital with more than 2 million annual outpatient visits, where we were informed of the clinical and research activities of the hospital's pharmacists. We also explored the production facility of Hanmi Pharmaceutical Company, a top international research and development-investing firm in South Korea, through an extraordinary tour provided by their representatives. At the end of the tour, Dr. Hogue said in his closing remarks, \"We were impressed by the automation of Korean hospitals, pharmacies and pharmaceutical companies, and also impressed with Korea's pharmacy education, the clinical work of hospital pharmacies, and the advancement of pharmaceutical production and research facilities.\" Our Korean colleagues and counterparts at SYU made us feel welcomed and comfortable during this trip, even while contending with fine dust pollution. We hope for lasting and productive research and academic collaborations with SYU as a result of our short, but purposeful, visit.COLLABORATIONS WITH SAHMYOOK UNIVERSITY By Ike dela Pe\u00f1a, PhD, Assistant Professor Twenty Japanese students visited Loma Linda's School of Pharmacy and Medical Center in February as part of a two-week program to help them learn about healthcare in the U.S. In fact, for more than 20 years, Loma Linda University Health has welcomed a group from Josai International University (JIU) in the Chiba prefecture of Japan. Their annual trip to the U.S. is part of an international program coordinated by University of California Riverside (UCR). In addition to learning from curriculum provided by UCR, the Japanese students visit various pharmacies, including retail and compounding sites, around Southern California. Their stop JAPANESE STUDENTS VISIT LLU/MC CAMPUS By Jen Mathew, MA With change comes the opportunity to grow. The Department of Experiential and Continuing Education (DECE) is now led by Chair Alireza Hayatshahi , PharmD, APh, BCPS, Director Farnoosh Zough, PharmD, BCPS, and has set its focus on implementing a revamped rotation curriculum, policy, and preceptor training. One of the first changes to take place in the department was the addition of a Community II rotation. With feedback from preceptors and students, the department was able to identify a need for more experience within a community setting prior to a student's Advanced Pharmacy Practice Experience (APPE). This course rotation is 40 hours a week and gives students a better understanding of the everyday operations of a community pharmacy. With the new 7-1-7 academic calendar, more rotation blocks have also been added to IPPE institutional and APPE course rotations to provide various scheduling options to students. Fourth-year students will benefit from these additional blocks as they allow them to plan their schedules accordingly to develop their portfolio and participate in seasonal post- graduate opportunities, such as residency, without interrupting their rotation. Effective communication is essential to the success of the program. As the liaison between students and preceptors, the department establishes and maintains partnerships with practice sites near and far. The department has worked closely with the Curriculum Committee, Department of Pharmacy Practice, and practice sites to identify challenges and carry out solutions to train practice-ready pharmacists and equip preceptors with resources to educate and evaluate student learning. As preceptors themselves, Drs. Hayatshahi and Zough saw a need to deepen communication with preceptors. The DECE Advisory Committee, which consists of pharmacists from sites such as Community Hospital San Bernardino, Redlands Community Hospital, and Desert Valley Hospital, was created to strengthen the connection between practice sites and the program curriculum. The committee serves to provide feedback on the experiential curriculum and assessment that will, in turn, help to create a more meaningful training experience for students. Experiential training makes up 30% of the total curriculum. With new experiential curriculum, preceptor education is essential. DECE leadership is committed to providing continuing education and training for all preceptors. The department plans to expand resources for preceptor development to include on-campus and on-line ACPE accredited continuing education sessions. \"This serves two purposes. It's one way we can show appreciation to our preceptors for their time and service. Second, it helps to assure a dynamic and top-quality practice experience for students,\" explains Dr. Hayatshahi. Providing preceptors with valuable continuing education sessions that focuses on their specialty is an important factor to their growth. Implementing change within the DECE has brought about challenges, but the department has viewed it as an opportunity to learn. According to Dr. Zough, \"Our goal is to equip our students with meaningful Introductory Pharmacy Practice Education and Advanced Pharmacy Practice Education training to successfully transition students from their didactic education to clinical practice.\" The DECE's hope is to provide a comprehensive experiential experience where resources are centralized and there is an ongoing dialogue taking place between preceptors, students, and the DECE.NEW DECE LEADERSHIP FOCUSED ON GIVING STUDENTS VALUABLE LEARNING EXPERIENCES By Jessica Gray, BA at Loma Linda University Medical Center teaches them about hospital pharmacy. Norm Hamada, PharmD, Director of Clinical Pharmacy Services at LLUMC, has been involved since the program's inception. According to his recollection, \"Way back when, I think UC Riverside contacted the pharmacy, and our administrative assistant forwarded me the call because it sounded like an educational opportunity.\" Ever since, Dr. Hamada has been serving as a tour guide/ point person for each visit. He meets with the students and faculty representatives first in Shryock Hall and provides them with an overview of pharmacy curriculum and the profession of pharmacy in the States. This is followed by a tour of the LLUMC second floor inpatient pharmacy. For the past two years, Dr. Hamada has been accompanied by PY2 student Justin Nishino, who helps with interpretation. Nishino, though born in the U.S., was raised in Japan and speaks fluent Japanese. The JIU students are in a Bachelor's degree in pharmacy program, which they enter immediately after high school. Dr. Hamada notes that the students are usually very professional in their demeanor and extremely eager to learn about how pharmacy is practiced here. We look forward to another visit from Japanese students in the years to come!L to SCHOOL OF PHARMACY10 11December 7-9, 2018, a health clinic was held at Loma Linda Chinese SDA Church. During the event, free health services were provided by the Adventist Medical Evangelism Network (AMEN), who partnered with the San Bernardino Department of Public Health, Loma Linda University (School of Pharmacy and School of Dentistry), Loma Linda Chinese SDA Church and Yorba Linda SDA Church. These services included all aspects of health care (medical consultations, dental services, vision, vaccinations) as well as social services (nutrition education, resource booths, a live concert, and haircuts). Throughout the two days, the AMEN Clinic served over 500 patients of the Inland Empire. Among the services offered, LLUSP provided both flu vaccinations and medication consultations to patients who requested it. When asked about the experience of volunteering for this clinic, Dr. Kiwon Park (LLUSP Class of 2016) said \"I just enjoyed interacting with the people who came by. I liked that we got to perform immunizations because pharmacists usually don't get to do hands-on services at mission trips and volunteering activities.\" For myself, it was definitely an eye opener. When I first heard the health clinic would be in Loma Linda, I knew it would make a big impact because it is in the San Bernardino County area. I'm very glad I was able to be a part of this service to the public. LLUSP students and faculty members also took part in providing these services. I was glad to see so many students getting involved in this volunteer opportunity and to reunite with some faculty members during the event. The diverse experiences that come from volunteering and helping those in need are invaluable. The AMEN Clinic plans to continue these services annually. From my experience with the clinic, I now understand how much planning an event like this takes. Seeing everyone come and work together for a single goal made it a very fulfilling and memorable experience and one that I highly recommend to students and other alumni.COMMUNITY SERVICE LLUSP PARTICIPATES IN AMEN FREE CLINIC By Alan Estareja, PharmD, Class of 2013 INTERNATIONAL OUTREACH I had always wanted to participate in a mission trip, especially if it involved improving the lives of children. Although I am not a Seventh-day Adventist, I chose the pharmacy program at Loma Linda because of the university's strong reputation and many global mission trips. I didn't think that I would be a part of one so soon in my first year of the program, but the opportunity presented itself, and I jumped on it right away. Only five spots were available to pharmacy students for this trip, and I was blessed with the opportunity to go. This mission trip was hosted by the Adventist Development and Relief Agency (ADRA), and the objective was to complete the construction of a school in a jungle village along the Amazon River. This was a huge effort of more than 200 volunteers from universities in both the US and Brazil, so I had to brush up on my Portuguese. The mission presented many challenges, both because of the intensive labor and difficult living conditions. The weather in the Amazon is hot and humid, and it hosts aggressive insects. We had only two weeks to complete the construction of the school, and I was assigned tasks both new and familiar to me. I was a painter, sanitation worker, heavy lifter, and cook. I learned how to build walls, put in grout, and complete electrical installation. I developed a deep gratitude for the people that do these tasks for a living. But I also learned to appreciate more the love and detail that God put into His creation. I listed all the things I was thankful for and was surprised at a few items. While working in the sun, I praised God for clouds that would block the sun and bring rain. God would also send a breeze that felt good on our sweaty bodies, and I would say \"So that's what sweat is for!\" Then the sweat would be prevented from entering my eyes, and I would say \"So that's what eyebrows are for!\" Little details like these made me realize how perfect God's creation is. Despite the intensive labor, I felt that the greatest challenge was the living conditions. All volunteers had to sail about 30 hours by boat to reach the village where the school was located. These double-decker open air boats were our homes for two weeks, and we slept like sardines on hammocks with mosquito netting as our \"walls.\" When it rained, a tarp was pulled down along the sides of the boats to keep us and our belongings from getting drenched. Each boat housed at least 20 volunteers and had only two restrooms with the toilet and shower water supplied from the river. Privacy, personal space, comfort, and cell phone service were sacrifices made on this trip, but in turn, we were forced to be present in every moment and to bond with the people with whom we were serving. On inauguration day, we were introduced to the students and their families who would use and enjoy the school we had built for them. Seeing the excitement and happiness on their faces, along with hearing their dreams and aspirations, made all the hard labor and sacrifices worth it. To know that this school will help make their dreams a reality gave me a sense of fulfillment. I had always been skeptical of donating to individuals or organizations that I was not familiar with, regardless of whether I agreed with the cause; however, this trip gave me the opportunity to not only help fund a good cause, but to also be at the forefront of service and physically contribute. The experience has inspired me to give back as long as I am able and to share God's light where there is darkness. This mission is definitely not my last, and I thank God for using me for his glory.

When we finally got to our lodge, we found out that there were not enough rooms and running water would be scarce. It had been almost two days of traveling. The exhaustion and frustration were catching up to me. I began to question why I chose to go to Africa in the first place. I had expected that I would need to be flexible and that not everything would go according to plan. However, I did not expect things to fall apart so soon. I remember trying to fall asleep that first night and worrying about how things would to turn out. My uncertainties got a reprieve the next morning when we attended the local church. I have never been welcomed the way that those church members received us. The Angolan people were some of the most hospitable people I have ever had the privilege of meeting. We were guided to the front row and everyone we met had a friendly smile or a kind word for us. Their singing and worship service uplifted my spirit. As I sat through that service, I was reminded that I did not come to Angola for myself. I was here because God had opened the door for me, and no matter how this trip turned out, I still had a responsibility to carry myself in a positive manner. My resolve to be positive was tested later that evening when we found out we did not have a plane ride to the city where we were supposed to conduct our medical mission work. The local airline did not want to fly a plane full of foreigners because they were afraid of possible terrorist attacks. We were instructed to pray for a way and hope for the best. Again, I found myself questioning God and His purpose as I tried to sleep that night. The next morning, after hours of waiting, we learned that we would be flying on a military jet to our destination. I could hardly believe it! My anxieties were soon replaced by anticipation at this unexpected turn of events. We piled on to the plane for the hour-long ride to Humabo, where we would do our mission work. As we deboarded the plane, the clean air and cool temperature was a stark contrast to the dust and humidity of Luanda. This time, everything was ready for us and the place the local people had arranged for our stay could rival any upscale hotel in the United States. We had clean rooms, marble bathrooms, and hot showers. Once again, God showed me that He was in control. After we rested, we met with the local medical team and other international volunteers who would collaborate with us. We met with physicians, nursing staff, dentists, allied health professionals and translators. We were given a tour of the hospital, dental clinic and convention center where the pharmacy would be. We were introduced to local government officials, and everyone seemed to buzz with excitement for the potential to serve the Angolan people. Our local hosts were ready for us and were genuinely enthusiastic about the opportunity for collaboration. I was certain that everything was going to work out, and we would accomplish what we came to do. The next morning we found out that a stop was placed on all the medical work. At the time, we were uncertain if this would last. Our group leaders spent hours in meetings with various authorities to sort out what had happened. However, a few days later we got an official order from the government: we were forbidden from doing anything that involved direct patient care. The physicians could not do physical exams or surgeries. The dentists could not provide teeth cleanings and extractions. The behavioral health and optometry teams could not provide mental health and eye screenings. We could not dispense the $100,000 worth of medications that were purchased for us. We were told we could only stay as tourists. I was angry and resentful that every step seemed to be so difficult. It seemed like we had come to Angola to wait. We waited for the bus to pick us up. We waited for our meals. We waited for bottled water. We waited for good news. We waited for answers. All our waiting brought nothing in the end. Everything was falling apart and our efforts were futile. I was at a loss when I heard there were patients - some of whom had been waiting in line for days -- who had to be turned away. I could not understand why this was happening and where things had gone wrong. At almost the end of our stay in Angola, we got a call saying that we were given permission to provide health education. We still could not give direct patient care; however, we could provide education according to our specialties in the local church. We were thrilled that we could do something. I hastily worked with my professor, Dr. Hong, to come up with some educational content. Dr. Hong gave me the opportunity to serve on a panel of healthcare professionals and represent the School of Pharmacy. I was able to educate patients about pain medication safety, antibiotic resistance, and medication adherence. After the panel discussion ended, each discipline scattered in a different section of the church, and audience members were given an opportunity to come and speak to professionals from any discipline with questions they had. The response was overwhelming. We were asked so many questions about topics that ranged from psychiatric medications to proper antibiotics for carbuncles. We did not have enough time to answer all the questions as our time in the church ended. When we finished our health education session, my heart also broke because I could see that there was clearly a need for proper medical care in Angola. Every discipline that presented had numerous people come to them with questions. We were sad that we could not do more or stay longer. In the days that followed, I had time to think about myself as a person and what service meant to me. I realized that while I considered myself to be quite patient, I was in fact very impatient. I abhorred waiting. I wanted to know what was happening, and I wanted answers. I also realized the importance of being flexible. I had to learn to accept that sometimes no matter how well you plan, things may not go well. I discovered that serving others was not only about doing medical mission work. You can serve people by being kind, genuine, and positive as Christ was during His time on Earth. I thought I was going to Angola to do important medical work. However, I came back from this trip learning more about the things I need to work on in my personal life. As a pharmacist, there might be days when nothing goes well. As I went through my APPE rotations over the past several months, I thought about my time in Angola often. Many patients are underprivileged and their access to resources are limited. While reading the H&Ps of some of my patients, I have been shocked to learn about the economic burdens they must overcome to receive proper medical care. During my rotations, I often found myself waiting for prior authorizations and proper documentation before I could process a patient's discharge. I discovered that I must be flexible in finding the most cost effective and appropriate medications for my patients. I also must be patient when I communicate my interventions to the resident physicians. As I counsel my patients on the medications during their discharge, I have come to realize that a kind greeting and a positive attitude can go a long way when providing care. Angola has taught me that while it is important to be a good pharmacist, it is more important to be a genuine Christian and an empathetic human first. All the service in this life is meaningless unless you can treat people with the same kindness and patience with which Christ treated us. SOMETIMES THINGS DON'T GO AS PLANNED: MY TRIP TO ANGOLA By Nithya Abraham, PharmD, Class of 2019 Last summer I had the opportunity to serve with Loma Linda University Global Health Institute's mission trip to Angola, Africa. I had never been to Africa before, and I was quite excited for the chance to experience a different culture and serve others through my profession. Despite my excitement, I was also apprehensive. The planning process for this trip was exhaustive and extensive. I had to get vaccinations I didn't even know existed, attend multiple orientations, find mosquito nets, and somehow keep up with all my schoolwork to take my final exams early and leave on time. Even before we could begin our work, I felt like we were running into roadblocks. The Angolan consulate, which had initially promised visas prior to our travel, failed to deliver the visas. We found out that we had to pay an exorbitant amount in extra baggage fees even though we met the weight limit that was initially communicated to us. ANGOLA THE CAPSULE 2019 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF PHARMACY14 15INTERNATIONAL OUTREACH Serving as the Supervisor of the LLUSP Pharmacy in San Bernardino is Danielle Davis, PharmD, RPh. Last summer, she led a Students for International Mission Service (SIMS) trip to Malawi and took two pharmacy students with her. This was, in fact, Danielle's fifth journey to Malawi. (Her visit in 2012 lasted an entire year!) During her most recent trip, Danielle journaled about her experience as she served at the Malamulo SDA Hospital. SCOPING OUT THE MISSION Day 1 - 9 July 2018 Everything is quite different from when I left. Now there are two well-trained pharmacy technicians. On the surface, everything seemed disorganized (just as I had expected) with regards to the medical stores and pharmacy, but I expect very soon I will better understand the situation. Today I met with the CEO, Jason Blanchard, and he gave me a general assessment of the situation. He walked with me to the Central Stores, which one might consider the heart of the hospital, to introduce me to the new pharmacy team members. While at stores I listened to various complaints/concerns from various departments. One such complaint came from the Theatre (or Surgical) Department. The Theatre Department is unable to proceed with daily case-loads because the hospital is out of surgical gloves. Because gloves are necessary for examinations, it turns out that surgical gloves were given to other wards in order for patients to continue to be seen. However, this has negatively impacted the Theatre Department which has had to delay all cases by at least a week. With cases complicated by the immunocompromised status of patients, this can quickly turn into a dire situation if there isn't resolution, but clinicians are unable to help. All over the hospital, there are shortages. I'm asking myself if this has to do with supply issues or inventory management. STUDENT ARRIVAL Day 2 - 10 July 2018 Drove into town to meet students Polly Nguyen and Regina Tran at Chileka Airport in Blantyre. The plane arrived about an hour late but TIA, This Is Africa. I was prepared for the changes because as any missionary knows, Plan A never fully gets executed, and back up plans are always necessary. After meeting students, hospital transport took students and belongings to Malamulo to settle down for the night. Work begins tomorrow.HYPERTENSION CLINIC IN THE OUTPATIENT DEPARTMENT/ ASSESSMENT Day 3 - 11 July 2018 On this Wednesday morning, the students and I went to the hospital's morning devotional. It is here where I was reintroduced, and the girls were inducted into Malawian culture. As a part of that induction, we had to line up as everyone at morning devotional greeted us very warmly. After all, Malawians call their country \"the warm heart of Africa.\" Next, we went to the outpatient department to see what time hypertension and diabetes clinic starts. Things began around 8:30 a.m. It was quite cold that day, so there were fewer patients than usual. We were able to do blood pressure screenings for about 15 people. Of those 15 people, we discovered at least three had hypertensive emergencies. I asked the nurse if Captopril was available to treat these patients because Captopril is part of treatment for hypertensive crisis and can be appropriately managed locally. She said they just use Nifedipine ER and recheck in an hour. This was another part of the shortages JOURNAL OF A MISSIONARY: MY TRIP TO MALAWI By Danielle Davis, PharmD, RPh LLUSP Class of 2012 at the hospital. While this medication isn't part of hypertensive crisis guidelines, I was just glad she did not instruct for the tablet to be crushed. I remember when this clinic used crushed Nifedipine for these situations; but during an in-service I provided during one of my previous visits, I taught them about the potential cardiogenic shock from its use. It's good to see that change in practice. But it also begs the question -- is there some way to provide the donation of Captopril to be used for hypertensive emergency situations? In the afternoon, we began to develop a plan for sorting out all of the inventory management issues. We decided to communicate with the wards to find out what items they need on a regular basis to provide patient care. We created a top 50 out of stock item request list to hand out. We hope the Stores will let us know what is truly essential for medical care, and we also want to learn from the finance office how often the hospital has these shortages. SET-BACKS AND NEW TEMPORARY PROJECTS Day 4 - 12 July 2018We went to each ward explaining the purpose of the document and requesting feedback. This task only lasted until about 10:30 once we had found all of the charge nurses for the wards. We then went to the private outpatient ward and teamed up with a second-year medical student. The task involved sorting, separating, and interpreting collected data that assessed gynecological cancer rates. This was the end of the second day at Malamulo. I feel like we're no closer to helping the hospital achieve the objective we intended to help with: the pharmacy. REAL WORK BEGINS Day 5 - 13 July 2018 This was a Friday. We finally were able to reach someone that could truly examine the issue the hospital was facing. Malamulo is a rural hospital, and many of the patients have difficulty with the hospital bill at times. Therefore, in an attempt to provide the best patient care, donations are heavily relied upon. As it happens, the hospital's major donation group had decided not to provide donations to Malamulo any more. The reason: their inventory management was poor. Rewind to 2013, when I went to Malamulo as a Global Service Award recipient. The donor group was requesting more information about how donations were being used, along with stories. The hospital needed to show those donors how their contributions impacted patient care. Without these reports from the hospital, it seems the donor group wanted more information about how the donated item inventory was managed. Long story short: inventory was not managed in the manner the donor group expected, and Malamulo was cut off from donations from this group. Now, fast- forward to July 2018 on a Friday morning, only two short working days before we were scheduled to leave the country. Once we were made aware of this problem, we got to work. We began with addressing inventory issues that could simplify workflow in Central Stores and hasten patient care slowed by the retrieval of supplies. Regina and I started with physical inventory of stock while Polly began creating an Excel spreadsheet for running totals on inventory. INVENTORY MANAGEMENT AND TRAINING Day 6 - 16 July 2018 We were able to procure some organizational tools for those working in Central Stores Supply. Upon beginning work Monday, we couldn't wait to show them the inventory log book we put together in addition to providing a more efficient filing system. Down at Central Stores Supply, we continued working on our inventory tasks, but we also began training the pharmacy technicians working there to help make inventory management more manageable. GOODBYES AND ACTIVITIES CONTINUED WITH MORE TRAINING Day 7 - 17 July 2018 Last day at Malamulo. The day began with morning devotional and a formal goodbye. We were able to address the audience attending worship and then everyone shook our hands to wish us the best of luck on our journey. After devotional, we headed down to the Central Stores. We presented the organizational items we purchased for the staff there. The whole idea was to implement a change which they would find very helpful. In mission service, it is important to note you must meet a need before introducing anything new, so that is exactly what we did. We helped them to organize before introducing an Excel tool for managing inventory. Polly Nguyen had created the spreadsheet with fixed formulas to allow for running totals for easy retrieval when necessary. The items and training we provided were very basic, but sometimes problem resolution is that simple. DEPARTURE Day 8 - 18 July 2018 The work is over now, and we are bound for Ethiopia, Dulles International, on to LAX, and then home. MALAWITHE CAPSULE 2019 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF PHARMACY16 17INTERNATIONAL OUTREACH This past summer, I joined a group of students from the schools of pharmacy, medicine and behavioral health on a Global Health Institute (GHI) mission trip to China. We conducted health fairs on the importance of exercise and dental health and presented health lectures on child safety, ergonomics and well-being at various hospitals in Hangzhou, Yongkang, and Dong E. Based on my previous experiences with mission trips to Russia, I expected that many of the places on our travel schedule would be a little behind the US in technology and that buildings would not be in the best of shape. In Russia, the local hospitals I visited were old buildings in disrepair with large holes in the floors. But when we arrived at the hospitals in Hangzhou, my expectations were blown away when I realized they were some of the more advanced buildings I've seen. The lobbies had ATM-like machines where patients could pay their bills or get lab and x-rays results. They also had large LED monitors for displaying wait times and other information. In another hospital, the outpatient pharmacy stored medications in a giant machine that could also dispense prescriptions when needed. However, I was even more impressed by the hospitality at each place we visited. At every stop the red carpet was rolled out and we were given top-line treatment. They had giant signs at the front of each hospital or in the lobby welcoming the \"Delegates from Loma Linda University.\" They provided tours led by the hospital administration and interpreted by the hospital staff fluent in English. After a tour and pictures, they fed us meals that seemed fit for a king with all sorts of food such as rice, mixed vegetables and various meats and tofu. We were also taken to local museums or cultural spots that were famous in the area. One example of their humility and hospitality has stuck with me. The day we were leaving Dong E, it started pouring rain. We had planned to eat in a caf\u00e9, which was about a 5- to 10-minute walk away, and afterwards load up the bus to go. As we were about to head out in the rain, we got a message from our GHI group leader to wait a few minutes before leaving. A short time later, we received another message that breakfast would be delivered to the apartment building where we were staying and that we should take our luggage down to the basement. We took our bags down and were preparing to load them when we were told, \"No, go get food, and we'll load the bus later.\" When we returned to our apartment, we learned the hospital president and other administrators weathered the rain to deliver the food to our apartment. After finishing breakfast, we went downstairs to discover the staff had loaded up the bus with all of our bags. We were incredibly thankful to them! I took a few lessons away from the trip. The first is that if you have a chance to go on a mission trip, you should go. It will teach you things about yourself and you will learn about other cultures that you won't be able to learn otherwise. Also, it will break you out of your norms and get you to try new things. The second and most important lesson I learned is to never let an elevated position or authority go to one's head. I must be sure to treat patients, clients and customers with humility, respect and kindness, just as the management team at Dong E did to us.LESSONS FROM CHINA By Jeffery Haugen, Class of 2020 STUDENT HIGHLIGHTS CHINATHE PRAYER CIRCLE By Jen Mathew, MA On the morning of the first day of classes, student members of Christian Pharmacists Fellowship International (CPFI) joined together in prayer. The event was organized by Isaac Lee, PY2, president of the school's chapter. Prior to the start of the academic year, Lee had sent a Facebook message to members of the incoming class inviting them to pray and be prayed for as they commenced their journey through pharmacy school. PY2 members of CPFI also attended the prayer meeting outside Shryock Hall. This was the second time the organization initiated a prayer circle to begin a new year at LLUSP. \"We did it because we wanted the upcoming class to feel welcomed and supported. Before they officially started class, we wanted them to know that they are starting classes at Loma Linda University, a place where they are truly cared for,\" Lee said. October was declared American Pharmacists Month in the cities of Loma Linda and Redlands thanks to the efforts of LLU pharmacy students in APhA-ASP (American Pharmacists Association - Academy of Student Pharmacists). The official proclamations were made during city council meetings, first by Redlands Mayor Paul W. Foster on October 2 followed by Loma Linda Mayor Rhodes Rigsby on October 17. Several students attended the meetings, along with faculty member, Dr. Nancy Kawahara, and PGY1 resident, Dr. Kevin Mai. As APhA-ASP Policy and Advocacy Vice President, Jenee Vo, PY2, was instrumental in prompting the city announcements. \"I strive to increase recognition of pharmacists' roles in patient care in the community,\" she said. \"At the school of pharmacy, one of our missions is to provide pharmaceutical care to the public. I felt that municipal recognition for this hard work would be a nice gift to the school, our teachers, pharmacists, and student pharmacists who have been providing care for many years in our surrounding cities as well as around the globe. I was fascinated when I learned from Dr. Kawahara what previous generations of pharmacists did to advance our profession to its current status. I believe it is important to make sure the upcoming generation of pharmacists continues to keep our profession well represented, well advanced, and well recognized.\" Vo found it meaningful when Mayor Foster recalled with admiration the pharmacists he worked with for over thirty years as a senior executive with the Southern California Permanente Medical Group, the physician partnership of the Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program. During that time, he oversaw hundreds of employees in a wide range of ambulatory health care departments, including many pharmacists directly integrated into the delivery operation of the departments. He said he had great personal respect and appreciation for pharmacists and the work they do. During the Loma Linda City Council meeting, Mayor Rigsby (a graduate of the Loma Linda University School of Medicine) invited Vo to address the council before the proclamation was made. She spoke about her goals as a student pharmacist at LLUSP and her goals for patient care when she becomes a pharmacist in the future. The proclamations will help to highlight the value of pharmacists and the field of pharmacy for years to come. Vo says she plans to reach out next fall to more cities, such as San Bernardino and Moreno Valley, to make sure that American Pharmacists Month is recognized in the entire surrounding area. STUDENTS INITIATE AMERICAN PHARMACISTS MONTH PROCLAMATIONS IN TWO CITIES By Jen Mathew, MASTUDENT HIGHLIGHTS THE CAPSULE 2019 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF PHARMACY18 19I'm a single mother, and I've had to overcome a lot. But I'm motivated to help my community and set an example for my kids. My message to others is that if I can do it, you can do it, too. It doesn't matter where you are in life \u2014 if you want to do it, you can! I was a farm worker in Calexico when I stumbled into pharmacy through the unemployment office. I used to go in about every two weeks to look up postings. I became a very familiar face there. One day, the man behind the counter told me, \"Hey, we just got funding for some trades education. Are you interested?\" We went through all the jobs I could be educated to do, but honestly, I either couldn't stomach the kind of work on the list, or I didn't think I was good enough for it. I thought the best thing I could ever achieve on that list was to become a truck driver; but even then, I would have issues because I'm only 4'11\"! But the man behind the counter encouraged me to try the pharmacy technician program, and so pharmacy it was! The state-funded program paid for my books, tuition, gas money, all of my needs, and I became the first in my family to receive higher education. Luckily for me, I was placed at Target for my internship, and eventually they hired me. While I was there, I worked with a pharmacist named Pablo who really inspired me. He was Hispanic, and he was adored in his community. When I watched him bridge the gap between the languages and change people's lives as he explained what their medications were for and how they should take them, I knew, That is what I want to do! I want to be Pablo! Maribel CardenasNot only do I admire Pablo for what he did in his community, but also for how he encouraged me. I come from a family where my dad has always discouraged me from going to school. I moved with my kids from Calexico to the Inland Empire to live with my parents while I go to school, and my dad still says things like, \"You're a joke! You'll never make it. We're not meant for college. What are you doing?\" All of these comments have been strongly embedded in my mind. But Pablo told me success stories and said, \"We can do it, too! As long as you have the drive, you're as good as anybody else!\" He set me on my mission to achieve my goal. I worked for four years at Target and then Walmart. At Walmart, I worked with several alumni and interns from Loma Linda University School of Pharmacy. They made such an impression on me. I can truly say they embodied the mission of Loma Linda. It was then that I started dreaming of going to LLUSP. Three years ago, I started working at the Loma Linda University Medical Center, and I met more LLUSP alumni. My experience with them solidified in my mind that LLUSP was where I wanted to be. I'm very grateful for my Loma Linda family. They've worked with my schedule since day one, and some people have even tutored me in a few subjects. And now that I'm a student at LLUSP, I feel blessed. We have prayer and Week of Renewal, which has really helped me get through some personal difficulties. It's the perfect place for me. I was born in Los Angeles, raised in Lynnwood until I was 12, and moved with my family to Fontana. I've lived there ever since.In undergrad at CSUSB, I was a biochemistry major, and I applied to pharmacy schools after graduation, but I wasn't accepted. My back-up plan was to become a pharmacy technician to get some experience, and then I planned to eventually apply again. Honestly, though, I was lost. I applied everywhere. I prayed, and in my heart, I wondered, Where am I going? Somehow, I stumbled on the job listings at Loma Linda, and I applied for a pharmacy courier position, even though it paid minimum wage. After that, I reluctantly became a pharmacy tech. But I went into it kicking and screaming because I really just wanted to go to pharmacy school. In my mid-20s, I was impatient and wanted to get it all done. But in hindsight, and from a spiritual standpoint, I see God knew I wasn't ready yet. After I became a pharm tech, I lost sight of my dream for a little while. I got used to the money, I bought a house, settled down and got married, and we had a child. But shortly after the birth of my son, there was a resurgence within me that came along with the responsibility of being a father. I wanted to set an example for him, and I wanted to keep myself motivated to pursue my initial goal of becoming a pharmacist. At the same time, I was friends with Maribel, and she kept pushing me, saying, \"Hey, let's go to pharmacy school together! We can be study buddies!\" I saw her motivation, I saw my baby son, and I told myself, I'm not going to be left behind! I'm going to get on that train! I am thankful for the LLUMC pharmacists, my supervisors, and the pharmacy director who motivated me and wrote letters of recommendation for me. Joseph Han [LLUSP Class of 2015] was especially helpful. I now believe that after my college graduation, I was led to Loma Linda to work as a currier because it was the start of the course to where I am now. Most of my family isn't educated. I'm the only one with a Bachelor's degree. And now I'm going for my PharmD. I would like to show everyone that if I can do it, so can they. Most importantly, my son can see that if his dad did it, even at 35, he can do it, too. Jose CovarrubiasMaribel Cardenas FROM PHARMACY TECH TO PHARMD STUDENT: Four P1s from the Loma Linda University Medical Center Tell Their Stories of Determination and Destiny By Jen Mathew, MATHE CAPSULE 2019 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF PHARMACY20 21STUDENT HIGHLIGHTS Just weeks before graduation, Amy Reese, PharmD, learned she had been accepted to Yale's Sherwin B. Nuland Summer Institute in Bioethics. She would leave for Connecticut and spend seven weeks in the distinguished program which affords attendees the opportunity to network with U.S. and international professionals and graduate students while developing their knowledge in bioethics, understanding how to use bioethics in their careers, and expanding bioethics throughout the world. While studying for her doctorate of pharmacy at LLUSP, Amy earned her master's degree in bioethics from LLU's School of Religion. It meant substantially more work for her, managing two schedules from two different schools and attending bioethics classes even during pharmacy school midterms and finals week. She did not get a spring break, and her winter breaks were shorter, too. But Amy insists the bioethics program was fun because she loves the subject. She also appreciates the opportunities she had to collaborate with students from other disciplines. \"Friendships with students in the schools of dentistry and medicine enhanced my life and my understanding of those professions,\" she reflects. One of Amy's professors, Dr. Alex Dubov, recommended she apply for the fellowship at Yale University. Dr. Dubov had attended the program a few years before and spoke highly of it. Requirements for the fellowship included submitting a copy of her transcript, her CV, a letter of recommendation, and two essays describing how she expected the program to affect her study or career and how she handles conflict. Amy felt compelled to join the institute at Yale because she respects the opinion of her School of Religion professor and because she wants to deepen her understanding and application of bioethics in her future career. \"After the summer program, I plan to take my boards and then look for a job,\" Amy says. \"I hope to use the knowledge I gain to help shape a bioethics department in a hospital or help patients with ethical dilemmas.\" MINORITY STUDENTS CELEBRATED DURING DIVERSITY CONSECRATION By Willie Davis, PhD, Associate Professor The first official event of the 2019 graduation season at Loma Linda University, The Diversity Consecration Service, was held on Friday, May 17, in the Alumni Hall Auditorium on campus. This annual event is special because it is planned by two student organizations, The Association of Latin American Students (ALAS) and The Black Health Professional Student Association (BHPSA). The purpose of the ceremony is to celebrate the academic achievements of those graduates who are members of under-represented minority groups. Pastor Miguel Mendez, Associate Pastor for Spiritual Development at the Loma Linda University Seventh-day Adventist Church, inspired the audience with a worship message from the Beatitudes in Matthew 5:3-12. He told the graduates that their professional careers are meant to be an expression of the Gospel, and they are to be righteously lived out among \"the meek, hungry, and poor of spirit\" so that those individuals can personally experience the love of God. The evening culminated with each graduate receiving a commemorative medallion to wear during the upcoming graduation exercises. Aisha Ahmad, Melany Martinez-Perez, and Rachel McDaniel, graduates of the School of Pharmacy, were honored during this ceremony. 2019 GRAD IS YALE BOUND By Jen Mathew, MA For more information on the dual-degree MA in Bioethics program, check out the LLU School of Religion website, religion.llu.edu/academics/degrees/ma-bioethics.I come from a family of nurses, and I just really wanted to do something different. That's why I am working to become a pharmacist. I came to the U.S. from the Philippines when I was 10, and we moved to Colton. We did a lot of moving around \u2014 Pennsylvania, Texas, back to Pennsylvania \u2014 but then we returned to California in 2005 or 2006. I hesitantly applied to nursing school but was put on a waiting list. In the meantime, I decided to apply to the pharmacy tech program. I went to school about eight months and then was immediately hired by Target. I also worked at 4-D college as an instructor for almost a year, so I had two jobs. I had a baby and actually got sick from trying to do too much, so I quit teaching and after only a year at Target, I quit working there, too. I applied at LLUH East Campus and started working there part-time. That was the start of a nine-year career at the medical center. It didn't take long before I started working more hours, and eventually I became a lead-tech. Ultimately, between working more hours and raising two kids, it probably made it more difficult for me to finish my pre-requisites for pharmacy school. But last year it hit me that I am getting old and I have no time to waste, and though I hardly got any sleep, I worked very hard and put in a lot of class time. And it paid off! I was accepted to LLUSP! The pharmacists and interns I worked with at the medical center really helped me and encouraged me to continue my education. They helped me with my schedule when I was taking pre-requisite classes and gave me words of encouragement. Dr. [Antony] Gobin [LLUSP Class of 2007] has been especially awesome. He is very reassuring and supports students in pursuing whatever it is they want to do. Now that I'm a pharmacy student at LLUSP, I've received confirmation that I'm in the right place. I grew up in a Seventh-day Adventist family, and so many of my family members attended school at Loma Linda University. I feel very comfortable here. I feel like I've come full-circle, now that I'm working and studying at Loma Linda. When I was 11 years old, I became gravely ill and was hospitalized at the LLUMC Children's Hospital. I was in the ICU for nearly a week. To be back here as an adult \u2014 it actually feels very fulfilling. After attending RCC-Norco and UCR, I transferred to La Sierra University. As a student, I also worked at Walgreens, and I met several students who are now P2s and P3s at LLUSP. I finished my degree at La Sierra in 2016, and I applied to pharmacy school but didn't get in the first round. I was pretty discouraged, so I just transitioned into full-time work at Walgreens. Soon, I got used to working full-time and making money. I was getting closer to paying off my car, and that began taking priority. But working in retail started wearing me down, and I couldn't remember why I liked being a pharmacy technician. I applied for different pharmacy technician jobs at hospitals. I applied to Loma Linda so many times it got to the point where I had too many active applications, and the system told me I needed to stop applying! Still, I kept checking the Loma Linda website. One day, I saw a posting for an IV-room position, and I was like, \"Oh, this one hasn't popped up before. This sounds pretty cool.\" It just so happened that one of my former La Sierra classmates worked there, and I ended up getting hired last summer. One of my interview questions for the job was, \"Why do you want to work here?\" and I mentioned my goal was to pursue a career in pharmacy. My interviewer said, \"Oh, we have a pharmacy school here.\" And I said to myself, Yeah, I know! Andrew Carroll [LLUSP Class of 2007], interviewed me, too, and he told me they work with employee's school schedules. Then I really knew I wanted to work for Loma Linda. Andrew is now my supervisor! I feel fortunate to have started work here and to have that kind of support and so many opportunities afforded me. I've been working at the medical center in the second-floor IV-room, and I do a lot of the compounding. I was also trained at the East Campus. And while I was waiting to hear about my acceptance to the School of Pharmacy, I took advantage of the opportunity to train at the cancer center and surgical hospital. I wanted to learn as much as possible and become more competitive through my work experience. Having a background as a pharmacy technician is definitely an advantage in pharmacy school, especially with calculations and the SIGs. We already know many of the medications and their uses. So far, our first-year pharmacy classes are just filling in some of the gaps of knowledge we didn't have before. We have a very solid foundation, for sure. Kristin Saenz Martin BaileySTUDENT HIGHLIGHTS THE CAPSULE 2019 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF PHARMACY22 23A CELEBRATION OF TALENT, INTELLECT, LEADERSHIP , EXCELLENCE AND GRIT During the annual LLUSP Honors & Awards Ceremony on May 23, 48 awards and scholarships totaling $82,000 were presented to students, preceptors and professors. Each year, LLUSP recognizes and rewards the achievements and excellence of all of its associates. Following are several highlights of the event: For the first time, awards for \"Teacher of the Year\" were voted on by classes of students.HONORS & AWARDS FACULTY OF THE YEAR CLASS Willie Davis, PhD P1 Kristopher Boyle, in different categories were honored as well. PRECEPTORS OF THE YEAR CATEGORY Stephen Hom Alumni Brian Amador External Justin Kinney LLUSP Faculty Huong Tran LLU Medical Center Monique Moore LLU Medical Center Deans Scholarships were awarded to students Lawrence Chui, Rimon Hasso, Duy Nam Nguyen, Kirsten Edmund Class of 2019, received the Boushra & Mariam Attallah Scholarship, an annual gift from LLUSP Class of 2007 alumni Michael Campbell, PharmD, MBA and Claudia Attallah, PharmD. The scholarship is named in honor of Claudia's parents. Congratulations to each of this year's recipients! AT A \"WELCOME TO THE LLUSP ALUMNI FAMILY\" CELEBRATION DURING THEIR FINAL RECONNECTIONS MEETING, PY4S ANNOUNCED THEIR PLANS POST-GRADUATION. What's Next for the Class of 2019? STUDENT HIGHLIGHTS THE CAPSULE 2019 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF PHARMACY24 25At LLUSP's annual Honors & Awards Ceremony, Dr. Stephen Hom was named in absentia Alumni Preceptor of the Year. Hom is the Pharmacist-in- Charge at Valencia Pharmacy at Henry Mayo in Santa Clarita and won the award based on the very positive ratings and comments from students who learned from him during the 2018-2019 academic year. Below, he explains his perspective on preceptorship, what students learn at his site, and his appreciation for his alma mater. It is an absolute honor to be given the award as LLUSP Alumni Preceptor of the Year. LLUSP provided me with a strong education base and platform to grow professionally, and I will forever be grateful for my time spent there. It was undoubtedly some of the best years of my life. I will always value the time that my professors and preceptors took out of their busy days to teach me. Because of those interactions, I have always believed in the importance in giving time to positively influence, educate, and guide the next generation of pharmacists. I view each rotation with our students as a symbiotic relationship. While ultimately the goal is for preceptors to teach their students, it never fails that students also teach their preceptors. Students keep preceptors' minds fresh, energized, and motivated, and I appreciate the challenge and aim to give each student a positive experience during their rotation at my site. Healthcare has recently taken center- stage in our country, and as community pharmacists, I believe we can collectively make a positive impact, given that we are the most accessible healthcare professionals. One of our biggest challenges is healthcare literacy and our patients' ability to not only understand their health but also their healthcare plans. We encounter countless frustrations from patients trying to understand how their plans work, why their plans aren't covering certain medications, or why their copays are so high. I truly believe that it is our responsibility to educate ourselves and become experts in healthcare so we can help the patients we interact with on a daily basis. The rotation offered at Henry Mayo helps to provide that knowledge so students can educate their own patients in the future. Additionally, our rotation offers students a chance to get an in-depth business perspective on the daily functions of an independent specialty pharmacy. We work closely with many manufacturers, and our workflow takes on a patient-centric approach. Our pharmacy model allows students to interact and counsel patients on some of the most recently FDA-approved specialty medications that are oftentimes not in the typical pharmacy curriculum. Whether students want to focus on the intricacies of running a pharmacy, improve their knowledge in managed-care, or gain clinical experience on specialty medications, I'm proud to say, this rotation can provide it all. I humbly thank LLUSP again for this recognition and look forward to continuing to see its students.MY WHY: PRECEPTING STUDENTS FROM THE LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF PHARMACY By Stephen Hom, PharmD, Class of 2013 To become a preceptor for LLUSP and shape future generations of pharmacists, contact Dr. Alireza Hayatshahi, Chair of the Department of Experiential and Continuing Education, by sending an email to ahayatshahi@llu.edu.PRESIDENT'S AWARD WINNER LAP-WOON KEUNG, CLASS OF 2019 After earning a B.S. in psychobiology from University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), Lap-Woon Keung began working towards his PharmD at Loma Linda University School of Pharmacy (LLUSP). At LLUSP, Lap-Woon demonstrated again and again an extraordinary commitment to his academics, classmates, and God. Throughout his time in pharmacy school, Lap-Woon maintained an exceptional GPA, consistently ranking near the top of his class. He was a member of Rho Chi, the international honor society for pharmaceutical sciences, and served as its president during the 2017-2018 academic year. As president, he spearheaded a new tutoring system allowing students to pick both the subject matter and tutor for one-on-one sessions as well as the time for the sessions. He was also instrumental in creating two seminars for pharmacy students, \"Academi-WHAAT?\" and \"Interviewing 101: Investigating the Intricacies of Interviews.\" Because of his innate ability to lead, Lap-Woon was also elected to other influential positions in various LLUSP chapters of state and national pharmacy organizations. He served as a project manager for Phi Lambda Sigma (PLS), an American college honor society for pharmacy students. Additionally, he was Director of Membership for LLUSP's chapter of the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists and a Representative/Liaison for the school chapter of the California Pharmacists Association. Lap-Woon serves with passion and with a heart for God. He regularly assisted with School of Pharmacy outreach booths during Redlands Market Night and volunteered for TELACU events at nursing homes to educate underserved elderly patients on various Medicare prescription drug plans. In all that Lap-Woon does, he intends to demonstrate Christ's love to those around him. He has said that his goal is to live a life with integrity and communicate God's love in words and in relationships. In doing so, Lap-Woon has earned a reputation for being very amiable, thoughtful, and professional. He is also known for his focus and diligent work while maintaining an enthusiasm for helping patients and moving the profession of pharmacy forward. In recognition of his scholastic achievement, participation in his student community, and his Christian commitment, Lap-Woon Keung was this year's recipient of the President's Award. MY REASONS FOR DONATING TO LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF PHARMACY By Raul Brewster, PharmD Class of 2010 There is a myriad of reasons why someone would choose to donate to any given cause. I personally choose to donate to LLUSP because I hold the belief that supporting a cause greater than your own is noble and just. Future generations will judge us when we depart from this life, and doing something to help others will ultimately leave a positive, lasting impression. History teaches and allows us the opportunity to grow and to better ourselves. In doing so, we create a better global community. Our school's motto focuses on growth physically, mentally, and spiritually. This is my primary reason for my annual donation. It's my hope that my contribution will enable the next generation of students to transform pharmacy to what it should be. Our profession is currently being marginalized by corporations for their profit which ultimately goes against our principles as pharmacists. Alas, we all have bills to pay, but in a profession where efficiency is prioritized, patient safety becomes jeopardized. It's my wish that the next generation of pharmacists will rise above to challenge the climate of our profession and elicit change through legislation or other avenues. We should all proudly wear our LLUSP lapel pins on our coats every day - To Make Man Whole is a cause worth supporting. Scholarships are supported, in part, by donations from alumni.

That's impressive! It is an acquired skill. I've been fortunate enough to do some of the bigger races like the Redlands Bike Classic and the AMGEN Tour of California. The AMGEN is a world tour race on par with The Tour de France. Do you have to audition to be a motorcycle referee? You have to network. Before you can graduate to motorcycle referee, you have to become an official on foot, being able to do everything that they do and understand the dynamics of the different types of races, each one requiring a different skill set. You have to know what to do and when to do it and think under pressure. For example, a motorcycle referee who didn't understand race dynamics stopped in the middle of the road during a race causing the cyclists to crash into him, one of them being US professional cyclist Taylor Phinney who suffered some pretty serious injuries. How many female motorcycle referees are there at a typical event? I worked the men's race for the AMGEN. There were about thirty of us and I was the only woman piloting a motorcycle. What are some of the parallels between leading a race and leading a department? The cyclists are almost like students. You have to be able to make difficult calls on the fly. You have to be very objective about the rules and policies, follow them, know how to interpret them and know which side of the line you fall on when things don't go the way they're supposed to. One last thing: you're known for your impressive vocabulary. What's your favorite word and can you please use it in a sentence? Well, I am a big fan of alliteration and when I can contiguously string together vindictive, vitriolic vituperation I get a certain sense of supercilious solipsistic satisfaction. Say that three times fast! Administrative Assistant Amanda Limonius and Laboratory Assistant Sara Solak sit down with the new-ish Chair of the Department of Pharmaceutical and Administrative Sciences (DPAS), Victoria Maskiewicz, PhD. So, what brought you here to Loma Linda? An airplane? Did you get a job here first or did they recruit Rich? They recruited my husband Rich first. The true story is that we saw a picture of the mountains and the school and Rich thought it was Yorba Linda. So, that's what originally piqued his interest, but the mission of Loma Linda did and still does resonate with us even though we are not Adventists. The idea of a school that advocates for something larger than \"I want to be a pharmacist, make a lot of money and go buy myself a BMW\" was something that we both bought into. Rich loved the service component of Loma Linda's mission. We both do, but Rich especially because he has a passion for service. His research embodied service and was in underserved populations in Africa suffering from HIV and how to prevent transmission.It's funny that you started as Principal Lab Assistant and now you are the Chair of the pharmacy science department! I did! I have had a varied and colorful career. I started off as a pharmacist. I was in a five-year bachelor's program and on the east coast no one had heard of a PharmD. I had planned to be a ski- bum pharmacist - take the graveyard shift at a hospital and ski all day. Ask me how I was going to manage these two things simultaneously, I don't know! You don't really think about these things. Unfortunately, I blew out my knee playing sports so that plan went by the wayside. I realized I wanted more. I liked the science component of pharmacy so I went into pharmaceutical chemistry and worked in industry for a number of years. It's where I met the OTHER Dr. Maskiewicz. I then decided I wanted to do something in law because, as the other Dr. Maskiewicz will tell you, I like to argue and I like to be right. I took a number of years off to be home with the kids and work as a consultant in biotech intellectual property law. When we moved out here, I had to decide between working in intellectual property law or working in industry again which meant working in Orange County or staying in this area. In Yorba Linda? Yes (laughing), in Yorba Linda. The only position I could get was Principal Lab Assistant. So I've had a rather meteoric rise to department chair. It goes to show that you just have to get your foot in the door. Like pond scum, I knew I would rise to the top (laughing). What are your hobbies? Well, I enjoy anything on two wheels. I like to bicycle ride. I'm a member of two bike clubs, Citrus Valley Velo and Redlands Water Bottle Transit Company. That sounds made up! (I'm kidding!) It is! But seriously, I try to put in about 100 to 150 miles on my bike every week, which is how I can eat my Lucky Charms, cupcakes and cookies. I am also an official for USA Cycling or USAC. I am a motorcycle referee, which means you have to be able to simultaneously take time splits, talk on the radio, take down numbers and ride on a motorcycle. INCHOATE INTROSPECTIONS: PEDANTIC PONDERINGS AND RETROSPECTIVE RUMINATIONS OF Amanda Limonius, BS, and Sara Solak, BSDR. BROWN MAKES SEVENTH VISIT TO TAIWAN AS A VISITING PROFESSOR By Daniel Brown, PharmD, Professor I returned to Taipei Medical University (TMU) on April 30 with my wife, Dr. Mary Ferrill, who is also a pharmacist and visiting professor. Our affiliation with TMU began in 2010 when I was Dean of the School of Pharmacy at Palm Beach Atlantic University (PBAU), and my wife was the Associate Dean for Academics. That summer we escorted 14 PBAU students to Taiwan to participate in a joint medical mission project with TMU students, providing screening and basic health services to inhabitants of a rural mountain community. In 2015, the director of the newly established TMU PharmD program invited us to provide workshops for clinical faculty and preceptors on active learning techniques and strategies for designing and implementing APPE rotations. We also conducted a series of seminars for pharmacists at the three primary TMU teaching hospitals in Taipei. The purpose of our recent trip was threefold. First, we consulted with pharmacy leaders at Wanfang Hospital about strategies for expanding pharmacist research and increasing the number of publications generated by members of the pharmacy department. Second, the timing of the trip enabled me to compete in the Taipei 101 Run Up, which involves climbing 91 floors (2046 stairs) of one of the tallest buildings in the world. I completed the climb in a little over 30 minutes, but more importantly, I did so without experiencing a major cardiac event! Joining me on the climb was Ya-Han Lee, a clinical pharmacist at Wanfang Hospital, who studied with me in 2016 while a TMU graduate student. I am now planning the final stair climb on my bucket list, the Willis Tower in Chicago, which is scheduled in early November. That climb consists of 103 floors (2109 stairs). The third and most rewarding purpose of the trip was to fellowship with Christian friends in the local church network of Taipei, many of whom are TMU faculty or pharmacists at Wanfang Hospital. Although less than 10% of the Taiwan population is Christian, the local church system thrives with enthusiastic believers who live out their faith in Christ with great passion. They follow the biblical teachings of two 20th century Chinese evangelists, Watchman Nee and Witness Lee, whose Gospel messages took hold in Taiwan in the 1950s and has since spread to countries all over the world. My wife and I have found great joy in visiting with our Christian brothers and sisters at TMU. We look forward to returning in November to conduct a new series of preceptor development workshops and to assist TMU faculty in redesigning the pharmacotherapy course sequence. ALUMNI NEWS THE CAPSULE 2019 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF PHARMACY32 33 She's a pharmacist capable of rebounding from difficult situations! She's a manager ready to organize any small company! She's got her own skin-care line on the side. It's Super Suha (Sue) Kilani! And she's a graduate of the Loma Linda University School of Pharmacy (LLUSP). As a young girl, Suha knew she wanted to work in healthcare because her mom suffered from brain tumors and paralysis, and Suha wished she could care for her and others. She knew working as a physician wouldn't do, however, as she can't stand the sight of blood; so at 22, when her mom called to tell her about a new pharmacy school opening in Loma Linda, she realized pharmacy might be just the right fit. She went right after finishing class at Chaffey College to check out LLUSP. Wearing jeans and a backpack, she walked in and asked for more information about the school and its pre-requisites. She immediately felt a sweet and kind spirit about the place. After speaking with the dean and her administrative assistant, she quickly submitted her application and was granted an interview. A year later, after she completed all of the required courses, she began studying at LLUSP. Suha remembers her time at LLUSP with great fondness. Morning worship time with Dr. Willie Davis and prayer before classes are things she especially appreciated. During Suha's time in pharmacy school, she was a young mom, and on a few occasions, she had to bring her daughter to class. Her own mother was rendered \"brain dead\" in Suha's third year of pharmacy school, and during her fourth year, her mother passed away. The devotions and time spent in prayer at school were meaningful to Suha. \"They encouraged me and brought me closer to the Lord. Those experiences really touched my heart.\" After graduation, she was hired at Loma Linda University Medical Center and began working on the adult side of the hospital. There she gained experience with IVs, compounding, chemo and cardiac pharmacy. \"That's one of the nice things about Loma Linda. It's so huge that you can get a lot of experience in many different settings.\" For two years, Suha worked the NOC shift until she went through a divorce with her husband. It was a very difficult time for her, and sometimes the stress carried over into work. But her workmates and supervisors were very supportive and offered her a morning shift so she could stay at home with her daughter at night. Soon after, Suha moved to the LLU children's hospital where she worked as a pediatric clinical inpatient pharmacist. More recently, Suha began working at a hemophilia specialty pharmacy, Community Healthcare Services. The company hired her as a staff pharmacist, but just a couple months later, she was asked to be a manager. They saw great potential in Suha as she made changes to the company that led to a 30% increase in profits and compliance with state requirements. In a few months, she was the pharmacist in charge of 34 states and dealt with around 60 sales representatives across the country. \"It was like an extra year of education, I learned so much! It was my first management position, but the owners were supportive because they saw that I put my heart into my work and give it everything I've got. We worked with clients all over the U.S., so people called at all times of the day, and I made myself available to them 24-7. People knew I was there for them.\" But although Suha's dedication and diligence helped tremendously, it wasn't enough to save the company, which closed due to prior, insurmountable issues. The people she worked with, however, were so impressed with her that when they moved to another company, Fidelis Specialty Pharmacy, they recruited her to go with them as a Pharmacy Director. \"I kept turning down their offers, but finally I accepted because they were too good! They're paying for me to move, they are helping to pay for my education so that I can earn my MBA, and they are just such good people!\" In the midst of all the bustle and then turmoil of work, Suha met a special someone. It was in Huntington Harbor, where she thought she would be kayaking with her sister. But Suha had been unknowingly set up on a blind date with a friend-of-a-friend named Alex. He and Suha ended up walking and talking for hours and never did set foot in CATCHING UP WITH SUHA KILANI By Jen Mathew, MA a kayak. They immediately clicked, and a couple of months later, they married. Perhaps it was her beautiful skin that attracted Alex \u2014 she does have her own skin-care products, after all. \"Be Natural USA\" is a skin care line and hobby of Suha's. She began making her own products years ago for herself and her daughter who has eczema. Then her neighbors asked to try some and her sister wanted samples, and they all loved it and kept asking for more. Word started spreading, and people began offering to pay for her products. Eventually, Suha's neighbor suggested she create a website. Be Natural USA is now on-line and has followers on Instagram, Youtube and Facebook. Suha makes all of her own formulas. She studied natural and essential oils and butters and their benefits for skin. She learned that skin needs vitamins just like the rest of the body. Raw ingredients for her products come from Canada and are organic and cold-pressed. \"This really isn't a business; it's just something I enjoy doing on the side. I do everything, from making the products, to creating labels and business cards, working on the website, taking the photographs and doing social media.\" But Suha hasn't had time lately to make new Youtube videos. She's been extraordinarily busy moving to a new city and moving into a new job and new marriage. There have been a lot of changes, albeit good ones. \"I keep moving forward. I keep going,\" she says. \"I tell people to be humble. Sometimes when we grow, we forget. The Lord taught me this through many challenging situations in my life. And no matter what happens, I know that God will take care of me. In the end, He makes everything okay.\" Keep up with what's happening at LLUSP through Facebook and Instagram.

For her research and interprofessional work that has helped to advance the field of pharmacy and because of her passion for and dedication to educating pharmacy students, LLUSP proudly claims Dr. Choi as one of its own. Dr. Jua Choi was born and raised on the island of Guam, a US Territory in Southeast Asia, until as a high school Sophomore, she moved to San Diego with her brother, who hoped to become a professional golfer. After graduating from Torrey Pines High School, she moved to New York to study pre-med and nutritional science at Cornell and completed an internship at New York Presbyterian Medical Center at Columbia-Cornell. After graduating, Choi returned to San Diego and worked as a registered dietitian at UC San Diego Medical Center for just a few months before she realized she needed a bigger challenge. \"I loved nutrition, but I got bored of it really quickly. As a dietitian, I worked closely with pharmacists and pharmacy residents, and I taught them about the nutritional aspects of TPN. I understood that both medications and nutrition were closely related and somewhat interchangeable, so I thought that a career in pharmacy would be a good transition,\" she explains. Although Choi applied to pharmacy school late in the game, she was accepted quickly and easily to the pharmacy schools at University of Southern California and Loma Linda University because all of her pre- requisites were completed. In the end, she chose LLUSP because she is a Christian, and a faith-based program appealed to her. She also felt attracted to the friendly, safe environment at LLUSP. Never one to shirk work or responsibility, Choi completed all of her pharmacy intern hours in two years at UC San Diego and worked as a per diem dietitian at Cedars- Sinai in Los Angeles. In addition, she worked closely with members of her study groups and created course notes with classmates. \"We really focused on making sure everyone in our class passed.\" She vividly recalls studying with Tiffany Royer, Jina Jung, Tuan Pham and Annie Nazarian. Jonathan Buya Aguilo (Class of 2008), also from Guam, was another peer Choi remembers fondly. After graduating from LLUSP 2010, Choi went on to Cedars-Sinai, where she completed both her PGY1 residency and a PGY2/Research Fellowship focused primarily on kidney and pancreas transplants. After residency, she was hired on to the kidney transplant team as a kidney transplant pharmacist. During her time there, she conducted various clinical trials while precepting pharmacy and medical residents and medical fellows, too. In addition, she spearheaded the implementation of the Cedars-Sinai Comprehensive Transplant Center ambulatory infusion center. During her seven-years at Cedars-Sinai, she was also heavily involved in finding innovative immunotherapy to help preserve and extend kidney allograft function. Choi is an enthusiastic ambassador for the field of pharmacy and role model for interprofessional collaboration. \"Pharmacists can help fill and improve health care gaps. We are so versatile, and it's important to show it,\" she declares. In 2017, Choi co-authored two papers which were published in esteemed medical journals. She was second author of a New England Journal of Medicine manuscript regarding the use of a novel IgG endopeptidase to help transplant highly sensitized patients, and she was first author of a paper in the American Journal of Transplantation reporting the use of tocilizumab (anti-IL6 antibody) to treat chronic rejection in kidney transplantation. Choi moved to the Bay Area in October of 2017 and worked at Stanford University as a Clinical Coordinating Center Project Director for the nation's first randomized pediatric heart transplant multi-center clinical trial and staffed as a pediatric clinical pharmacist at the Stanford Children's Lucille Packard Hospital. More recently, Choi started working at the Oakland Campus of Sutter Health as an outpatient clinical coordinator. She was hired to build their ambulatory clinical care program and pharmacy education programs for both IPPE and APPE rotations and the PGY1 and PGY2 residency program there. Meanwhile, Choi continues to provide support at Cedars-Sinai as a Transplant Research Pharmacist. As a working mom of three kids now, Choi is incredibly busy but still eager to re-connect with her alma mater. She is currently looking to provide more opportunities for LLUSP students at Sutter Health. Choi explains, \"LLUSP helped give me a foundation to become an essential health care provider, creative thinker, and dependable resource for colleagues, family and friends.\" Last November, LLUSP alumni living in the Sacramento and Bay areas were invited to dinners hosted by the Office of Alumni Affairs. The decision to visit alumni in northern California was made at the suggestion of Dr. Michelle Ann (Adia) Healy, Class of 2015. Healy, who visited the School of Pharmacy in the spring of 2018 as a guest speaker for its Professional Development class, proposed an LLUSP get-together for alumni living in her area because she knew several who had also moved north after graduation. LLUSP's Director of Alumni Affairs and Communications, Jen Mathew, and Director of Development, John Nafie, hosted two dinners in two evenings. Six alumni, including Healy and Drs. Tania Vidhyarkorn (2009), Hanh (Tran) Bergere (2009), Jua Choi (2010), Phoebe Chan (2015), Collin Chan (2015), and their guests attended the first dinner, held at Vanessa's Bistro in Walnut Creek. Linda Williams, Associate Dean for Student Affairs and Admissions, happened to be on a recruiting trip in the area and joined the LLUSP Alumni Affairs team the next evening at Piatti in Sacramento. They met with Drs. Cambria Wehtje-Sim (2011), Foday Manneh (2015), Sarah Beshay (2015), Christina Lee (2013), Jessica Loughlin (2009) and Han Nguyen (2016), along with their guests. The dinners afforded the opportunity for alumni to reunite and get reacquainted with one another. They also allowed for the Office of Alumni Affairs to communicate school, university and medical center news and updates to guests. Alumni were curious about faculty, staff and administrators they remembered, the incoming Dean, changes on campus, and Vision 2020 initiatives, among other things. Preliminary plans have emerged for a similar event in northern California in the near future. For location ideas and suggestions for alumni gatherings in other areas, you are welcomed and invited to contact the Office of Alumni Affairs. ALUMNUS OF THE YEAR: JUA CHOI By Jen Mathew, MAALUMNI AFFAIRS TAKES IT ON THE ROAD REMEMBER WHEN... Once upon a time, LLUSP hosted an annual softball game and picnic every spring. Back in 2010, students Phong Nguyen, Stephen Hom, Michael Corpe, Kendell Hutchins, Sean Jones, Alan Estareja, Aaron Solis, Adrian Bagamasbad, Jake Hehr, and Karin Pollard braved the heat to take on Dean Billy Hughes and his team of faculty and staff. We don't remember who won. But it wasn't really about winning, anyway.ALUMNI NEWS THE CAPSULE 2019 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF PHARMACY36 37It was the summer of 2014 when I came into pharmacy school with my heart set on opening up my own independent compounding pharmacy. I had never even heard of residency and had no prior desire to pursue post-graduate training. I accidentally became involved as the P1 representative for LLU's American and California Society of Health-Systems Pharmacists (ASHP/CSHP) student chapter. As an overly ambitious first-year student, I do not think I quite understood what I signed up for because it was difficult to distinguish between all the organizations' four-letter acronyms at the time. Eventually assuming the president position, I ended up advocating for and pursuing residency myself. It is funny how God's plans work out as I am here today on a career path almost completely opposite from the one I had initially planned for myself. I often get asked how one can prepare for residency. Unfortunately, the number of applicants vastly exceeds the number of positions available, and the best advice I can give is to make yourself a unique, competitive candidate during pharmacy school. When looking at programs, look for ones that support your interests and goals. A lot of people do not believe they can get a residency based on their GPA, but GPA is only a fraction of your application. You can expect that residency applicants will be highly qualified and extremely competitive, so I encourage potential applicants to seize varied, unique opportunities early on to make themselves stand out on paper. In addition to work experience and professional organization involvement, mission trips, research, and dual degrees are opportunities unique to the LLU School of Pharmacy that will help show potential residency programs a more multifaceted perspective of you as an applicant. During the interview, the focus shifts to both your clinical skills and personality. The application process and residency itself is by no means easy, so I always stress the importance of only applying to ones that fit your goals best. One must be strategic while researching, as the quantity of programs applied to may not guarantee the same level of quality across residencies. Originally from Los Angeles, I was hoping to match somewhere near home so that I could spend more time with my family. LLU offers an amazing program and was within my comfort zone, but I was looking forward to new challenges elsewhere. On Match Day, however, I realized that God's plans for me in Loma Linda were not quite finished. Despite how comfortable I felt as a LLU student, becoming a resident was challenging with a steep learning curve. I completed rotations in internal medicine, the adult outpatient oncology infusion center, the emergency department, along with cardiac, surgical, and pediatric intensive care units. My most memorable experience was in the emergency department, where I felt that pharmacists are utilized and respected as a great value to the healthcare team. I am humbled and grateful for the opportunity to have stayed on as a resident this past year with the multitude of opportunities to precept and teach for the School of Pharmacy. There is no other residency program that tailors to the needs and goals of its residents as much as ours, and there is an amazing amount of support from co-residents and the pharmacists we work with on a daily basis. During my short year here, I have had the honor of working with some of the most encouraging and helpful preceptors, technicians, and students. Looking back, it is amazing how fast time has passed as I feel that I have grown so much clinically, professionally, and personally as well. I could not have done it without my support system: my family, our residency program director and coordinator, along with my awesome co-residents. Despite my interests in emergency medicine and critical care, I chose not to pursue a second year of post-graduate training as I wanted to stay open to whatever opportunities became available. Though my future career isn't yet solidified, I have learned to trust in God. It has been an exciting, exhausting, and rewarding year as an LLU pharmacy resident. It is bittersweet leaving LLU for now, but I know God will place me where I'm meant to be. In the meantime, I'm going to take a vacation with my family. Up to this point, I've been guilty of not making time to relax, and there's a whole lifetime to work. Now is the time to rest, knowing God's got a plan. RESIDENCY: PLEASE\" Vanessa Tran, PharmD, Class of 2018 I am humbled and grateful for the opportunity to have stayed on as a resident this past year with the multitude of opportunities to precept and teach for the School of Pharmacy.\" DEYANA AND BISHOY: ANOTHER LLUSP LOVE STORY Hometown: Santa Clarita Number of years together: seven total, three married How they met: On the first day of Deyana's LLUSP orientation as a PY1, Bishoy was a PY3 \"mentor.\" He met Deyana through a mutual friend and was instantly attracted to her contagious laugh. During the orientation retreat in Big Bear, he noticed her funny and outspoken nature. A couple months later, Bishoy visited her and brought her flowers, to which she responded, \"That's okay, I don't need them.\" Initially, Deyana insisted she needed to focus on her studies but was drawn to Bishoy's kind heart. His sweet persistence sparked more conversations throughout the school year and won Deyana over as they had their first \"official\" date in December, 2013. \"She was a feisty one! She made me work hard, but it was all worth it,\" Bishoy says. Nicknames: Dodda and Bishbish Current employment: Deyana works for the Department of Health Services for Los Angeles County as a clinical pharmacist specializing in Diabetes, Hypertension, and Hyperlipidemia. Bishoy is a managed care pharmacist for an independent pharmacy. Work Commute Times: 1-1.5 hours each way for both!The trade-offs: For Deyana, the gratitude that her patients show her when she helps them improve their diabetes is deeply satisfying. \"It keeps me going!\" she says. For Bishoy, it's the impact he can make on patients' lives, helping them manage their disease and working together with them to achieve their therapy goals. Time together: A couple of hours in the evenings, Sundays, and occasional vacations off together. Best date ever: Sitting along the Siene River in France in the wee hours of the morning, with a picnic basket of breads and cheeses, admiring the lighted Eiffel Tower and watching the sunrise.Deyana Beshir, PharmD, APP (Class of 2016) and Bishoy Tannious, PharmD, AAHIVP, APh (Class of 2014) are one of LLUSP's adorable couples. Here's a quick run-down of how they met and what they are up to now.
