This page along with our [Acupuncture FAQs](https://scomedicalcenter.com/frequently-asked-questions/) provide the basics about TCM and Acupuncture. As you discuss your needs with Neal, he will try to answer those questions you have relating to your situation and treatment plan. About Acupuncture Originating in China, Acupuncture is one of the oldest most commonly used medical procedures in the world. Acupuncture is just one part of a broad system of Traditional Chinese Medicine dating back over 3000 years. Acupuncture is a family of procedures involving stimulation of anatomical locations in or on the skin by a variety of techniques. There are a variety of approaches to diagnosis and treatment in American Acupuncture that incorporate medical traditions from China, Korea, Japan and other countries from around the world. Most people curious about Acupuncture don't know that it improves the body's functions and promotes the natural self-healing process by stimulating specific anatomical sites commonly known as Acupuncture points or acupoints. The most common method used to stimulate acupoints is the insertion of fine sterile needles into the skin. These very fine medical grade sterile single use disposable needles are inserted into specific acupoints designated on the body to help alleviate pain and or eliminate various symptoms of illness. The FDA regulates Acupuncture needles as medical devices and requires that they be sterile non-toxic single use. Pressure, heat or electrical stimulation may further enhance the needles effectiveness. Other Acu-point stimulation techniques may include manual massage, moxibustion, heat, cupping and the application of various topical herbal medicines and liniments. While Acupuncture is often associated with pain control in the hands of a well-trained practitioner, it has much broader applications. Acupuncture can be effective as the only treatment used or as the support or adjunct to other medical treatment forms in many medical and pre-op post-op surgical disorders. Acupuncture is particularly useful in treating physical problems related to tension, stress and emotional conditions. Acupuncture complements traditional injury rehabilitation very well because it reduces pain quickly so that active rehabilitation and physical therapy and strengthening can begin sooner. Acupuncture reduces muscle spasm and increases joint range of motion which makes recovery faster. Acupuncture and TCM are very complementary to and work well with [Modern Western medicine](https://scomedicalcenter.com/integrating-acupuncture-traditional-chinese-medicine-with-western-medicine/). They are good options for illness. injury from sports, work related injuries, motor vehicle accidents and other types of personal injuries. How Do Acupuncturists Know Which Treatments To Give? After a careful discussion with each patient about their history and condition (and usually also about Acupuncture), Neal formulates a diagnosis and constructs a treatment plan. The use of the word \"constructs\" is intentional because each treatment may include several elements of TCM. Acupuncture may be combined with [Chinese herbs](https://scomedicalcenter.com/chinese-herb-store/). Different styles of [Acupuncture](https://scomedicalcenter.com/tcm-and-acupuncture-services/) and needle manipulation may be used. Moxibustion, cupping, manual therapy, rehabilitative exercises, Tai Qi, breathing exercises, Qigong Massage, or nutritional techniques may also be part of the plan. Perhaps massage or nutritional and lifestyle counseling techniques may also be considered. Each treatment plan is unique to your specific needs and goals. This by itself is one of the many distinctive elements of TCM. In modern Western medicine, treatments are often standardized with the only modification being the dosage of a medication. Western medicine is effective but is often more prescriptive than TCM and often does not take a whole-body balance perspective. Neal is also [experienced](https://scomedicalcenter.com/about-neal-and-the-sco-medical-center/) in Western medical diagnostic techniques and treatment options, blending this knowledge with TCM diagnostic and treatment options. This integrated approach is another thing that sets Neal's practice apart from other practitioners of TCM. Are Acupuncture and TCM Legitimate Medical Disciplines? TCM is based upon hundreds of years of successful use in many Asian and other countries. It has been proven effective for hundreds of generations and to master its use requires years of intensive training. Agencies like the [World Health Organization](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.acupuncture.org.uk/public-content/public-traditional-acupuncture/4026-who-list-of-conditions.html&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1613543962229000&usg=AOvVaw3_aUPXd5y1k7WZpollqGGI) and the [National Institutes of Health](https://acupuncture-nyc.com/nih-and-who/) have recognized Acupuncture and TCM as a legitimate and effective treatment for many diseases and ailments. The State of California recognizes and [licenses](https://www.acupuncture.ca.gov/) Acupuncture practitioners as primary health care providers. Neal S. Miller, LAc DNBAO has the training and certification of an individual who is a master of TCM and its numerous facets: LAc indicates that he is a Licensed Acupuncturist in California, and DNBAO means \"Diplomate of the National Board of Acupuncture Orthopedics.\" Many experts have used neuroscience to explain Acupuncture. Needling acupoints stimulates the nervous system to release chemicals in the muscles, spinal cord and brain. These chemicals will either change the experience and perception of pain or they will trigger the release of other chemicals and hormones which influence the body's own internal regulation system. This improved energy and biochemical balance produced by Acupuncture results in stimulating the body's natural healing abilities. This promotes physical and emotional well-being connecting Mind Body and spirit. Does Acupuncture Hurt? If there is a universal question about Acupuncture, this is probably it: \"Will it hurt?\". The needles used are extremely thin, 0.22 - 0.30mm in diameter, much smaller than a hypodermic needle. In fact, one or more Acupuncture needles can fit easily inside a hypodermic needle. But that doesn't answer the question of the amount of discomfort the needles may or may not cause. The perceived pain is, of course, dependent upon each person's tolerance for pain. Treatments are usually minimal to no pain. Most people report becoming deeply relaxed, more energized or both. People with a strong needle aversion may feel it more than other people. In general, though, the more relaxed you are, the better, and as a result most patients only feel slight pressure. Want To Know More About Acupuncture?
