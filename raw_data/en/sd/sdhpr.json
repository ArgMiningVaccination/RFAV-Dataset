Learn more about preventing the cold and flu \u2014 and how to get a flu shot on campus [here](../../resources/colds-flu.html). When you obtain your injections from the Allergy and Immunization clinic, we must store your serum or injectable medication for you. This is why we require that all medication be clearly labeled with your name, date of birth, expiration date, and the vial contents. This includes antigens, glycerin, etc. You may check out your serum or injectable medication when you need to return to your allergist. Please remember that when you check your serum back to us, do so during our drop off hours. To schedule an appointment, please call (517) 353-4660. Our staff will be glad to assist in scheduling an appointment time that is convenient for you. Please arrive at least ten minutes before your appointment. If you arrive after your appointment time, you may be asked to reschedule. Due to the possibility of serious reactions to injections, Allergy and Immunization requires all patients to wait in our office for 30 minutes after receiving injections. If you cannot stay the entire 30 minutes you will not be given any injections. We understand that life gets in the way, so if you are unable to keep an appointment, please call our cancellation line at (517) 355-7707 by 5 pm the day before your appointment. This message line is available 24 hours a day. There are fees for the administration of allergy serum, vaccines, and other injectable medications. In addition, there are charges for all routine immunizations, titers, TB skin tests, lab services, and nurse visits. We are happy to bill your insurance for these services. We are unable to provide information about coverage specific to your insurance. Please contact your insurance carrier directly for any questions you have regarding coverage, deductibles and or copayments. You will be billed for any amount that is not covered by insurance. Some insurance companies require prior authorization before you will be able to receive injections at Allergy and Immunization Clinic. Before scheduling your first appointment with us, please contact your insurance company to determine whether authorization is needed, and to have it in place prior to being seen at Olin. Payment is expected at the time of service unless we are billing your insurance, in which case, you may have a co-pay or deductible due. Insurance plans vary widely in the benefits they provide and it is important that you understand your benefits. You are responsible for paying all copays, deductibles, rejected claims and any balances remaining after insurance payment. Prior to coming into your appointment, please take a few moments to call your insurance company and understand the benefits provided under the terms of your policy. "}
