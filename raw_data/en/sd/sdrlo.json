Naturopathy is a unique system of holistic healthcare with a deep history of traditional philosophies and diverse treatment options. The home of modern Naturopathy is considered to be the United States, with naturopathic principles believed to have originated in Europe in the 16th and 17th centuries. Naturopaths & Herbalists seek to treat each patient individually and to address the underlying cause of disease as well as its symptoms. Your practitioner will enquire in detail about your health concern and all aspects of your health. Diagnostic testing may be considered appropriate, and treatments may include nutritional medicine, lifestyle recommendations, and mental health care. Most NHAA-affiliated naturopaths practise Western Herbal Medicine. What is Western Herbal Medicine? Throughout history people have used the medicinal qualities of plants to heal themselves. NHAA herbalists use powerful plant compounds that affect how your body works. A qualified herbalist can prepare an individual mixture of medicinal-grade herbs for you in liquid form, or dispense pre-packaged herbal products. The history of Western Herbal Medicine in Australia can be traced back to the First Fleet, which brought European plants to grow in the garden next to the first colonial hospital. Western Herbal Medicine has its origins in European traditions and plants. While Western Herbal Medicine is rooted in European traditions that came to Australia with colonisation, the NHAA acknowledges the traditional herbal medicine practices of the First Nations. We respect the deep and enduring connection to country, held by Indigenous Australians, and traditional knowledge of Australia's unique flora and fauna. Today, most NHAA-affiliated naturopaths also practice Western Herbal Medicine as part of their holistic treatment. The medicines used by NHAA members are regulated by the Therapeutic Goods Administration. "}
