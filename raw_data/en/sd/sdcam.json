It can be used to help patients with food allergies, anxiety, hormone imbalance, digestive issues, and other health problems. To see a chiropractor for your condition, call our Springfield, MO, office to make your appointment for an assessment and treatment. We at Meek Integrative Health Center are here to help. Discovering the Cause Functional medicine is biology based. It has the practitioner focus on the root cause of a disease in order to help the patent with it. A disease can develop because of many factors, and the practitioner will seek out what those causes are. This can help him or her to treat the patient as a whole. Many conditions might be caused by several things and functional medicine may be able to help you sort through them. When functional medicine is applied, a chiropractor on our team might look at the patient's lifestyle and the environment that they live in to paint a picture of what could be causing the disease. Once the cause of it is discovered, a chiropractor on our team can help determine what the treatment should be. The chiropractor will then help determine a treatment plan that's for your specific problem. The aim is to treat the disease rather than only treating the symptoms. This may help give the patients benefits that last longer than if the symptoms are treated. Health Prioritization Functional medicine can also be a way to make the patient's health issues a priority. To do this, the patient's medical history may be taken down. A chiropractor might look at the patient's family history as well as his or her social life. These are factors that might influence the health of the patient. This information may be organized and then a customized treatment plan may be created.
