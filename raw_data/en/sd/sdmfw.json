Recommendations from the AOM Committee A conditional recommendation against the intervention of low -dose versus high -dose amoxicillin . Even though the review found no difference between low-dose and high -dose amoxicillin , the overall certainty in the evidence is very lowa. Only one cohort study ( Chu et al., 2014 ) and one RCT (Bielicki et al., 2021 ) -dose amoxicillin be equivalent to high-dose amoxicillin for patients with AOM. When there is a lack of scientific evidence, standard work sho uld be developed, implemented, and monitored. Literature Summary Background . Acute otitis media (AOM) is the most common infection in early childhood (Venekamp et al., 2015) . Although AOM usually resolves without treatment, it is the most common condition for which antibiotics are prescribed in the United States (Lieberthal et al., 2013) . The American Academy of Pediatrics Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG; Lieberthal et al., 2013) recommends providing safety -net antibiotic prescription (SNAP) to parents of children > 6 months of age with mild to moderate unilateral AOM . A dose of 80 -90 mg/kg per day of amoxicillin is recommended as first -line therapy for most children with mild to moderate AOM for a duration of 10 days for patients 23 months of age and 7 days for patients 2 -5 years of age (Lieberthal et al., 2013) . Alternatively, in a systematic review (Suzuki et al., 2020) of European CPGs, only 7 of 14 CPGs recommended high dose amoxicillin (80-90mg/kg per day) as an option for first -line treatment. This review aims to synthesize the current literature on the topic of amoxicillin dosing . This review excludes older articles before the pneumococcal vaccine was widely administered due to its effect on the infection rate and causative organisms of AOM (Eskola et al., 2001) . Studies that looked at community acquired pneumonia (CAP) were included in this review as this disease is caused by the same organisms (Eskola et a., 2001) . This review will summarize identified literature to answer the specific care question. Study characteristics. The search for suitable studies was completed on July 11, 2022. R. El Feghaly, MD, MSCI -BC, ONC reviewed the 127 titles and/or abstracts found in the search and identifiedb 12 single studies believed to answer the question. After an in - depth review of the single studies, two single studies (Bielicki et al., 2021; Chu et al., 2014) answered the question. Summary by Outcome Retreatment by Day 28 One RCT (Bielicki et al., 2021) measured retreatment by day 28 , (N = 814). For the outcome of re-treatment by day 28 , the OR indicated that for patients with CAP the intervention of low dose amoxicillin (35-50 mg/kg/d) was not different to the comparator of high dose amoxicillin (70-90 mg/kg/d) , OR = 1.03, 95% CI [ 0.68, 1.56] (see Figure 2 & Table 2) Certainty Of The Evidence For Retreatment by Day 28 . The certainty of the body of evidence was low. The body of evidence was assessed to not have serious risk of bias, but serious indirectness, and serious imprecision. Indirectness was serious as the study population investigated w as patients with CAP. Imprecision was serious due to the low number of events ( n = 100) . As only one study (Bielicki et al., 2021) was identified to answer this question , consistency could not be assessed. Adverse Events One RCT (Bielicki et al., 2021) measured adverse events , (N = 814). For the outcome of adverse events , the OR indicated that for patients with CAP , the intervention of low dose amoxicillin (35 -50 mg/kg/d) was not different to the comparator of high dose amoxicillin (70 -90 mg/kg/d), OR = 1.14, 95% CI [0.62, 2.11] (see Figure 3 & Table 2) . Critically Topic (CAT): Acute Developed: 10/02/2022 If you have questions regarding this CAT - please contact evidencebasedpractice@cmh.edu Certainty Of The Evidence For Adverse Events . The certainty of the body of evidence was low. The body of evidence was assessed to not have serious risk of bias, but serious indirectness, and serious imprecision. Indirectness was serious as the study population investigated w as patients with CAP. Imprecision was serious due to the low number of events ( n = 100) . As only one study (Bielicki et al., 2021) was identified to answer this questi on, consistency could not be assessed. Successful Control (see Chu et al., 2014, for the definition of this outcome on page 13 of this synopsis) One cohort study (Chu et al., 2014) measured successful control , (N = 165). For the outcome of successful control , the OR indicated that for patients with AOM, the intervention of low dose amoxicillin ( 40-50 mg/kg/d) was not different to the comparator dose amoxicillin ( 80-90 mg/kg/d), OR = 0.52, 95% CI [ 0.14, 1.88] (see Figure 3 & Table 2) Certainty Of The Evidence For Successful Control . The certainty of the body of evidence was very low. The body of evidence was assessed to not have serious indirectness, but serious risk of bias, and serious imprecision. Risk of bias was serious due to the study being a retrospective cohort that was unable to verify compliance for antibiotics . Imprecision was serious due to the low number of subjects ( N = 165) and low number of events ( n = 121). As only one study ( Chu et al., 2014 ) was identified to answer this question, consistency could not be assessed. Failed Control (see Chu et al., 2014, for the definition of this outcome on page 13 of this synopsis) One cohort study (Chu et al., 2014) measured failed control, ( N = 165). For the outcome of failed control, the OR indicated that for patients with AOM , the intervention of low dose amoxicillin (40 -50 mg/kg/d) was not different to the comparator of high dose amoxicillin (80 -90 mg/kg/d), OR = 1.93, 95% CI [0.53, 7.03] (see Figure 4 & Table 2) . Certainty Of The Evidence For Failed Control . The certainty of the body of evidence was very low. The body of evidence was assessed to not have serious indirectness, but serious risk of bias, and serious imprecision. Risk of bias was serious due to the study being a retrospective cohort that was unabl e to verify compliance for antibiotics . Imprecision was serious due to the low number of subjects ( N = 165) and low number of events ( n = 44) . As only one study (Chu et al., 2014) was identified to answer this question, consistency could not be assessed.

Using the GDT, the author of this CAT rates the certainty of the evidence based on four factors: within -study risk of bias , consistency among studies, directness of evidence , and precision of effect estimates . Each factor is subjectively judged against the author's confiden ce of the estimated treatment effect. Confidence is assessed as not serious, serious, or very serious . If the attribute of serious or very serious is assessed , the author will provide an explanation. bRayyan is a web -based software used for the initial screening of titles and / or abstracts for this analysis (Ouzzani, Hammady, Fedorowicz & Elmagarmid, 2017). cThe Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation II (AGREE II) is an international instrument used to assess the quality and reporting of clinical practice guidelines for this analysis (Brouwers et al. 2010) . dReview Manager (Higgins & Green, 2011 ) is a Cochrane Collaborative computer program used to assess the study characteristics as well as the risk of bias and create the forest plots found in this analysis. eThe Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta -Analyses (PRISMA) flow diagram depicts the process in which literature is searched, screened, and eligibility criteria is applied (Moher, Liberati, Tetzlaff, & Altman, 2009).

Allocation concealment (selection bias) Low risk Trial kits were assigned sequential numbers based on the randomization list and delivered ready to dispense to site pharmacies. Blinding of participants and personnel (performance bias) Low risk Blinding was achieved by independent rebottling, packaging, and labeling of 2 amoxicillin brands. To ensure blinding for the duration comparison, a single amoxicillin brand was used for the first 3 days, followed by a different amoxicillin containing suspension (of the same concentration) or a matching placebo suspension for days 4 to 7. Blinding of outcome assessment (detection bias) Unclear risk Primary endpoint was subjectively adjudicated by an endpoint review committee Incomplete outcome data (attrition bias) Low risk Data analyzed per protocol, however very few subjects were excluded from analysis and would be unlikely to impact results Selective reporting (reporting bias) Low risk Data reported as expected Other bias Low risk No concerns: conflicts of interest reported appropriately and unlikely to impact study results Critically Appraised Topic (CAT): Acute Otitis Media ( AOM Dose Amoxicillin Date Developed: 10/02/2022 If you have questions regarding this CAT - please contact evidencebasedpractice@cmh.edu Chu et al.

JUDGEMENT RESEARCH EVIDENCE ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS No Probably no Probably yes Yes Varies Don't know Acute Otitis Media is the most common infection in early childhood (Venekamp et al., 2015). Although AOM usually resolves without treatment, it is the most common condition for prescribed antibiotics in the United States (Lieberthal et al., 2013). Desirable Effects How substantial are the desirable anticipated effects? JUDGEMENT RESEARCH EVIDENCE ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS Trivial Small Moderate Large Varies Don't know Successful Control (see Chu et al., 2014, for the definition of this outcome on page 13 of this synopsis) One cohort study (Chu et al., 2014) measured successful control ( N = 165). For the outcome of successful control, the OR indicated that for patients w ith AOM, the intervention of low dose amoxicillin (40 -50 mg/kg/d) was not different from the comparator of high dose amoxicillin (80-90 mg/kg/d), OR = 0.52, 95% CI [0.14, 1.88]. The desirable effects of a lower dose are fewer adverse drug reactions, medica tion side effects, and antimicrobial resistance. Undesirable Effects How substantial are the undesirable anticipated effects? JUDGEMENT RESEARCH EVIDENCE ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS Critically Appraised Topic (CAT): Acute Otitis Media Developed: 10/02/2022 If you have questions regarding this CAT - please contact evidencebasedpractice@cmh.edu Large Moderate Small Trivial Varies Don't know Retreatment by Day 28 One RCT (Bielicki et al., 2021) measured retreatment by day 28, ( N = 814). For the outcome of re -treatment by day 28, the OR indicated that for patients with CAP the intervention of low dose amoxicillin (35 -50 mg/kg/d) was not differe nt to the comparator of high dose amoxicillin (70 -90 mg/kg/d), OR = 1.03, 95% CI Adverse Events One RCT (Bielicki et al., 2021) measured adverse events, (N = 814). For the outcome of adverse events, the OR indicated that for patients with CA P, the intervention of low dose amoxicillin (35 -50 mg/kg/d) was not different to the comparator of high dose amoxicillin (70 - 90 mg/kg/d), OR = 1.14, 95% CI [0.62, 2.11]. Failed Control (see Chu et al., 2014, for the definition of this outcome on page 13 of this synopsis) One cohort study (Chu et al., 2014) measured failed control, ( N = 165). For the outcome of failed control, the OR indicated that for patients with AOM, the intervention of low dose amoxicillin (40 -50 mg/kg/d) was not different to the comparator of high dose amoxicillin (80 -90 mg/kg/d), OR = 1.93, 95% CI [0.53, 7.03]. Certainty of evidence What is the overall cer tainty of the evidence of effects? JUDGEMENT RESEARCH EVIDENCE ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS Very low Low Moderate High No included studies Certainty Of The Evidence For Retreatment by Day 28. The certainty of the body of evidence was low. The body of evidence was assessed to not have serious risk of bias, but serious indirectness, and serious imprecision. Indirectness was serious as the study population investigated was patients with CAP. Imprecision was serious due to the low number of events (n = 100). As only one study (Bielicki et al., 2021) was identified to answer this question, consistency could not be assessed. Certainty Of The Evidence For Adverse Events. The certainty of the body of evidence was low. The body of evidence was assessed to not have serious risk of bias, but serious indirectness, and serious imprecision. Indirectness was serious as the study population investigated was patients with CAP. Imprecision was serious due to the low number of events ( n = 100). As only on e study (Bielicki et al., 2021) was identified to answer this question, consistency could not be assessed. Certainty Of The Evidence For Successful Control. The certainty of the body of evidence was very low. The body of evidence was assessed to not have s erious indirectness, but serious risk of bias, and serious imprecision. Risk of bias was serious due to the study being a retrospective cohort that was unable to verify compliance for antibiotics. Imprecision was serious Minimal evidence exists on outcomes of lower doses versus higher dose. Only one cohort study on patients with AOM and one RCT on patients with CAP were included. Critically Appraised Topic (CAT): Acute Otitis Media Developed: 10/02/2022 If you have questions regarding this CAT - please contact evidencebasedpractice@cmh.edu due to the low number of subjects ( N = 165) and low number of events ( n = 121). As only one study (Chu et al., 2014) was identified to answer this question, consistency could not be assessed. Certainty Of The Evidence For Failed Control. The certainty of the body of evidence was very low. T he body of evidence was assessed to not have serious indirectness, but serious risk of bias, and serious imprecision. Risk of bias was serious due to the study being a retrospective cohort that was unable to verify compliance for antibiotics. Imprecision w as serious due to the low number of subjects ( N = 165) and low number of events ( n = 44). As only one study (Chu et al., 2014) was identified to answer this question, consistency could not be assessed Values Is there important uncertainty about or variability in how much people value the main outcomes? JUDGEMENT RESEARCH EVIDENCE ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS Important uncertainty or variability Possibly important uncertainty or variability Probably no important uncertainty or variability No important uncertainty or variability Some providers (e.g. Antimicrobial Stewardship) may weigh more heavily on the risk of adverse drug events, side effects, and antimicrobial resistance. Some parents/families of patients may weigh more heavily the risk of treatment failure. Balance of effects Does the balance between desirable and undesirable effects favor the intervention or the comparison? JUDGEMENT RESEARCH EVIDENCE ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS Favors the comparison Probably favors the comparison Does not favor either the intervention or the comparison Probably favors the intervention Favors the intervention Varies Don't know Minimal evidence exists on outcomes of lower doses versus higher doses. Only one cohort study on patients with AOM and one RCT on p atients with CAP was included. Resources required How large are the resource requirements (costs)? Critically Appraised Topic (CAT): Acute Developed: 10/02/2022 If you have questions regarding this CAT - please contact evidencebasedpractice@cmh.edu JUDGEMENT RESEARCH EVIDENCE ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS Large costs Moderate costs Negligible costs and savings Moderate savings Large savings Varies Don't kno w The mean cost of treatment for the amoxicillin group is $189.20 (Gaboury et al., 2010) The indirect costs of AOM, accrued primarily by parental time lost are $1330.58, 95% CI [$1008.75, $1652.43] (Alsarraf et al., 1999). Certainty of evidence of required resources What is the certainty of the evidence of resource requirements (costs)? JUDGEMENT RESEARCH EVIDENCE ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS Very low Low Moderate High No included studies No studies comparing the required resources of low versus high dose. Cost effectiveness Does the cost -effectiveness of the intervention favor the intervention or the comparison? JUDGEMENT RESEARCH EVIDENCE ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS Favors the comparison Probably favors the comparison Does not favor either the intervention or the comparison Probably favors the intervention Favors the intervention Varies No included studies Likely lower costs for lower dose. No included studies. Families would have to travel to pharmacies, obtain prescriptions, and follow written prescription instructions regardless of the dose. However, the cost would be greater for the higher dose. Equity What would be the impact on health equity? JUDGEMENT RESEARCH EVIDENCE ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS Reduced Probably reduced Critically Appraised Topic (CAT): Acute Otitis Media Developed: 10/02/2022 If you have questions regarding this CAT - please contact evidencebasedpractice@cmh.edu Probably no impact Probably increased Increased Varies Don't know Acceptability Is the intervention acceptable to key stakeholders? JUDGEMENT RESEARCH EVIDENCE ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS No Probably no Probably yes Yes Varies Don't know This would be a large change in practice. Would need stronger evidence. Feasibility Is the intervention feasible to implement? JUDGEMENT RESEARCH EVIDENCE ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS No Probably no Probably yes Yes Varies Don't know No issues with feasibility in prescribing lower dose SUMMARY OF JUDGEMENTS JUDGEMENT PROBLEM No Probably no Probably yes Yes Varies Don't know DESIRABLE EFFECTS Trivial Small Moderate Large Varies Don't know UNDESIRABLE EFFECTS Large Moderate Small Trivial Varies Don't know CERTAINTY OF EVIDENCE Very low Low Moderate High No included studies Critically Appraised Topic (CAT): Acute Otitis Media Developed: 10/02/2022 If you have questions regarding this CAT - please contact evidencebasedpractice@cmh.edu JUDGEMENT VALUES Important uncertainty or variability Possibly important uncertainty or variability Probably no important uncertainty or variability No important uncertainty or variability BALANCE OF EFFECTS Favors the comparison Probably favors the comparison Does not favor either the intervention or the comparison Probably favors the intervention Favors the intervention Varies Don't know RESOURCES REQUIRED Large costs Moderate costs Negligible costs and savings Moderate savings Large savings Varies Don't know CERTAINTY OF EVIDENCE OF REQUIRED RESOURCES Very low Low Moderate High No included studies COST EFFECTIVENESS Favors the comparison Probably favors the comparison Does not favor either the intervention or the comparison Probably favors the intervention Favors the intervention Varies No included studies EQUITY Reduced Probably reduced Probably no impact Probably increased Increased Varies Don't know ACCEPTABILITY No Probably no Probably yes Yes Varies Don't know FEASIBILITY No Probably no Probably yes Yes Varies Don't know CONCLUSIONS Recommendation Conditional recommendation against the intervention Critically Appraised Topic (CAT): Acute Otitis Media Developed: 10/02/2022 If you have questions regarding "}
