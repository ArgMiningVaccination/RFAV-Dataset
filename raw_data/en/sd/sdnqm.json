Anthroposophy in Toro nto is to be an association of people whose will it is to nurture the life of the soul, both in the individual and in human society, on the basis of a true knowledge of the spiritual world. 2. The members of Anthroposophy in Toronto are convinced that there exists in our time a ge nuine science of the spiritual world and that the civilization of today is lacking the cultivation of such a science. Our intention is to make a contribution to the scientific and cultural life of the Greater Toronto Area out of the transformative resources of spiritiual science.

Rudolf Steiner Karmic Relationships: Understandi ng Destiny with Grant Davis 6 Thursdays from 7pm to 9pm September 2 9; October 6, 13, 20; November 3, 10 Location: Friends House, 60 Lowther Avenue Cost: $100 or pay what you can Registration: Contact Robert McKay at (647) 981 -6298 (text or phone) or at ro bertmckay@rogers.com Grant Davis \"Anthroposophy should not be considered a theory or mere science, nor as knowledge in the ordinary sense. It is rather something that grows in our souls from mere knowledge and theory into immediate life, into an elixir of life...The more we experience anthroposophy as bringing to us strength, support and life renewing energies, the more do we understand it.\" ( From a lecture entitled \"Facing Karma\" Dr. Rudolf Steiner gave in 1912 in Vienna , collected in CW 130 .) Nowhere i s this vitalizing impact more significant than in the anthroposophical understanding of karma. Learning of the deep laws that rule beneath the surface of our day -to-day lives awakens us to community and to the opportunity that each moment presents us to b uild a better world. Rhythmic composition in yellow green minor (1919) by Roy de Maistre In this course you will learn why reincarnation occurs, how the life between life is the essential counterbalance to life on earth and how, through the laws of karm a, the great community of humanity i s flowing together through time and evolving toward future states of being The course will also include an introduction to the range of Dr. Rudolf Steiner's Karma Meditations as presented in Luigi rney of Spirit Recollection: for the Practice of Steiner's Karmic Exercises . A copy of the book will be given to each course participant and is included in the course fee. For the second class, Thursday, October 6, we will have a \"field trip\", g oing to Luigi Morelli's lecture (see details below). The lecture is free to course participa nts.

Thursday, October 6 to Sunday, October 9 Luigi Morelli We are so pleased that Luigi Morelli has agreed to come back to Toronto to provide a public lecture and weekend workshop. Public Lecture: True Thinking, True Feeling, True Living An Introduction to Anthroposophy and the Need to Accelerate Personal and Social T ransformation with Luigi Morelli Thursday, October 6 , 7:00 pm to 9:00 pm Location : Friends House, 60 Lowther Avenue Intended for a general audience, Luigi will introduce anthroposophy through an insightful exploration of everyday experience and current s ocial challenges. Drawing on insights from his important book, Accelerating Social Change: Impacting Our World While Transforming Ourselves , Luigi will explain how social change is more than a political statement or demand; it is a moral and spiritual imp erative. If this is so, then it involves the whole human being in the way he perceives and thinks, feels and relates, and acts on and impacts the world. This work gathers the threads of pioneers and visionaries in various aspects of social and cultural ren ewal. Paradigms of \"include and transcend\" offer us paths along which the personal and the global are intimately intertwined. Through established pathways and processes we can experiment with new ways of being as we impact our immediate world. Practically speaking, this book explores three avenues to change. At a first level we can start to recognize that society is built around three poles. Besides the public and private sectors, civil society has emerged to play a crucial role and alter dualistic thinking . If we think beyond capitalism and socialism and all their variations and combinations, new unthought -of frontiers and possibilities emerge. It is possible to expand our practice of democracy beyond the majority/minority dynamics to the inclusion of all s takeholders. A new art and science of civic collaboration can break the gridlocks of polarization and opposition. We can engage in a new area of honest, energetic collaboration moving beyond weak compromise, through an array of social tools that have grown in the last forty to fifty years and have now reached full maturity. Lastly, we can expand organizational and social forms in ways that completely break away from the past. We can reconcile both entrepreneurial and participatory paradigms and transcend to p-down or bottom -up models in ways that our intellect alone cannot fathom. Paradigms offer generous visions but are also exacting masters. The new revolution will request as much of ourselves as we will request of the world. AIT Newsletter September 2022 Page 7 Workshop: To Truly Live: F ounding from the Heart and Building a Community of Intention out of Anthroposophy with Luigi Morelli Friday, October 7 to Sunday October 9 Session Times , Location s provided upon registration Cost: $75.00 or pay what you can Registration: Contact Robert Mc Kay at (647) 981 -6298 (text or phone) or at robertmckay@rogers.com This will be a special workshop, designed for those seeking a pathway to living more deeply out of anthroposoph y. The workshop will draw from the mysteries of the Foundation Stone Meditati on as well as many aspects o f the work of Rudolf Steiner, and the experiences of some of his key pupils including Zeylmans van Emmichoven, Bernard Lievegoed, Ita Wegman and Walter J. Stein. Luigi will reference some of Dr. Steiner 's indications on how we can understand why we have to come back to the planet and how, at any age, to find one's destiny. Throughout the workshop, participants will have an opportunity to do eurythmy exercises aimed at complimenting and grounding the great ideas. Come experie nce that part of anthroposophy that makes an appeal to your willingness to experience with an open mind and open heart. Experience how we can build from the heart what can then be directed from our clear thinking. How can we create places of abundance and celebration for getting to know each other? What tools can we use for building joyous, effective communities? About Luigi Morelli Luigi is a remarkable person, whose life experience includes social activism, working with disabled adults, a deepening stud y of spiritual science, the application of spiritual scienc e to current cultural realities and a wonderful str eam of integrative insights. He is a prolific author whose writings cover diverse topics, revealing the quest of a true se eker who is full of love for lif e and full of hopeful suggestions for a better future. Luigi's books include: Karl Julius Schr\u00f6er and Rudolf Steiner: Anthroposophy and the Teachings of Karma and Reincarnation (2015) Aristotelians and Platonists: A Convergence of the Michaelic S treams in Our Time (2015) Of these two books, Luigi writes: These two books complement each other in relation to the question of the Michaelic streams: the first more from the perspective of Steiner's and Schr\u00f6er' s life tasks and their previous incarnatio ns. It sheds some light on the larger purpose of the karma revelations. The second one looks at the evolution of the streams from Greece to present time and tries to render accessible the contrast between Aristotelians and Platonists and why it is vital to integrate the two streams. J. R. R. Tolkien, Owen Barfield and the Cosmic Christ (2019) Of this book, Luigi writes: This is a complement to the first two books, looking at the contrast of the two streams mostly from Barfield and Tolkien's works o f fantasy. Exploring Themes of the Calendar of the Soul (2021) AIT Newsletter September 2022 Page 8 Of this book, Luigi writes: This has been for me a way to explore how the two paths are encompassed and enlarged through resorting to a set of very encompassing meditations. It is explored with a similar methodology that Konig used in his work on the Calendar. It looks at the evolution of themes throughout the year. Other works include: Accelerating Social Change: Impacting Our World While Transforming Ourselves (2021) The Journey of Spiri t Recollection A Handbook for the Practice of Steiner's Karmic Exercises (2022) Spiritual Turning Points of North American History (2010) Abraham Lincoln: a Spiritual Scientific Portrait (2021) For more on Luigi see his website: https://millenniumculmination.net/ 3.

Promoting Others' Events From the Anthroposophical Society in Canada, an important save the date notice. Big conference next summer! Festival Image by Jean Balekin Save These Dates: August 10 -15, 2023 That Good May Become A Festival of Initiative A North American Anthroposophical Conference In celebration of the centenary of the founding of the General Anthroposophical Society Location: The Interlake in Manitoba (an hour north of Winnipeg ) Contributors from the Goetheanum: Dr. Constanza Kaliks and Dr. Peter Selg At this important point in the biography of the General Anthroposophical Society, the Society in Canada is planning an important event for the summer of 2023. This celebration will take place at the center of our continent in the Interlake region of Manit oba, an hour north of Winnipeg. This location will be accessible not only for members from across Canada but also for friends in the Midwest of the United States. At the heart of this celebration is a question of what it means to take initiative in the br oadest sense and to stride into the future consciously. Part of this process is to consider how the laying of the Foundation Stone in the hearts of members has been cultivated. How have we been able to realize the reality of the Christmas Conference as a T urning Point in Time? What are the imaginations that can be developed that will help guide anthroposophy into the future? At this event we will be celebrating anthroposophical initiatives across the continent. We will explore how these initiatives, workin g in the wider culture, can become bridges from anthroposophy to spirit -inspired people and endeavours both regionally and across the land. The development of the arts and reaching out to young people are critical for this bridge -building process. They are the major building blocks for the event. 5. From Dornach Here is a recent editorial from the September issue of \"Anthroposophy Worldwide\", the newsletter of the General Anthroposophical Society in Dornach, which is available society members . Eart h's Life Forces : How Much Earth Do We Need? Ueli Hurter, Goetheanum Dear Members, The Russian writer Leo Tolstoy (1828 - 1910) tells the story of a peasant named Pahom, who is keen to acquire as much fertile land as possible but wears AIT Newsletter September 2022 Page 10 himself out in the process. He dies and is buried. The moral of the tale is that we need as much earth as is required for our grave. Compost at the Goetheanum (Photo: Jasmin Peschke) How is this today? Let's say that we are all of us together, all humans on earth, Pahom: currently 8,008,336,500 of us: How much Earth does humanity need? The answer is 1.75 Earths per year. This statement is based on the worldwide use of resources in relation to what the Earth can realistically provide. Earth Overshoot Day marks the date whe n humanity has used all the biological resources the Earth can regenerate in an entire year. This year, Earth Overshoot Day was on 28 July. Since then , we have lived on credit, borrowing from future generations. Centenary of Rudolf Steiner's Economics Cou rse Rudolf Steiner was also interested in how much Earth each of us needs. In the course he gave on Economics (GA 340) in the summer of 1922 he looked at this question from an economic point of view, asking the opposite question: How much earth is there for each of us? We find the answer to this question by relating the Earth that can be used to the population. Balancing Earth's Life Forces One can work out that 2,000 square metres of land are available for each person on Earth. And one can easily show h ow this is sufficient to feed everyone on Earth. So, there is room for all! The question is, how do we organize ourselves and what can we do to re - establish a balance between what we take from the Earth and its life forces. According to Rudolf Steiner all economic values must be seen in relation to the yield we gain from the Earth because that is the true foundation of our life. If there are too many economic values that bear no relation to the land and to nature, they should be taken out of the economy. On e way of achieving this is in the form of gifts to the free spiritual life. Less consumption of the Earth could lead to an increase in culture. We do not only need Earth, we also need life and spirit. About Ueli Hurter : Ueli Hurter (Photo: Ariane Totzk e) Ueli Hurter is a Swiss farmer and entrepreneur and the co -leader of the Section for Agriculture at the Goetheanum. He was elected to the Executive Council of the General Anthroposophical Society in Dornach at the 2020 Annual General Meeting. 6. From t he Canadian Society The Anthroposophical Society in Canada has launched a youth blog entitled \"Spiritual Vagabonds\" under the guidance of Yuri Curumthaully (Toronto) and the AIT Newsletter September 2022 Page 11 mysterious , or perhaps shy, S.H. (Vancouver Island). You can access the blog h ere: www.anthroposophy.ca/en/category/youth -blog Here is a recent contribution: August 23, 2022 My Internet Treasure Hunt Recommendation : Brian Gray's 'Wise Cosmos' YouTube Channel by S .H. Part 1 of series of reviews on anthroposophical online content such as courses, podcasts, and videos. As a millennial, to be technologically savvy essentially means to be able to effectively use the search engines on Google and YouTube. At first g lance, there is very little anthroposophical online content. Even if there is, the aesthetics of the web interface look as though it belonged to the early 2000's era of the internet. The lack of online presence of anthroposophical thinkers could be due to the fact many older generations of anthroposophists are tech resistant, or simply not knowledgeable or confident enough to use the internet to promote their work. However, the scarcity of what is available makes for a very fun, exhilarating treasure hunt f or anthroposophical gems on the web. Out of sheer curiosity, I began this treasure hunt by systematically searching all anthroposophical publishing houses, regional branches, bookstores, Rudolf Steiner Archives, adult education centers, then took it to th e next level and searched for traces of Anthroposophy on mainstream platforms, like Apple Podcast, Patreon, YouTube, Instagram, and even Reddit. There are wonderful free resources and interesting discussions in the most unexpected corners of the web, which could greatly benefit those who do not have access to immediate in -personal Anthroposophical studies and would like to deepen their learning. With this intention in mind, I hope to offer a series of reviews and recommendations of Anthroposophical online c ontent, ranging from podcasts, video series, courses, and other online resources. I never thought of searching \"Anthroposophy\" on YouTube until out of sheer deprivation of and desperation for spiritual content, I gave it a try and discovered Brian Gray's YouTube lectures on Astrosophy and how to read birth charts. An Anthroposophical inspired approach to astrology appeared to me to be a much more definitive and solid perspective to understand astrology amidst the overwhelming varieties of astrological read ings. Like many of Brian Gray's videos, they are filmed in a lecture setting, where he is speaking to a group of students, which makes for a more engaged and natural environment for online learning. His illustrations on the black board are clear, easy to follow as a visual aid and provide logical structure to the content. I was able to sit and listen while taking detailed notes, as though I was simply studying alongside his students. Brian Gray has a profound understanding of the works of Rudolf Steiner. H e served as a core faculty member for 38 years at the Rudolf Steiner college in Fair Oaks, California, where many of his online lectures were filmed. He currently directs the Wise Cosmos Educational Initiative, where he provides free and paid online course s on various Anthroposophical topics, such as Parzival, Philosophy of Freedom, star wisdom to esoteric Christianity. On the Wise Cosmos YouTube channel, he has a brief introductory video on the planetary seals. Brian Gray has many other informative videos posted on YouTube. One of my favorites is his introduction to the six basic exercises. One of the most breath -taking lectures is Brian Gray's three -part series on \"Intro to Esoteric Christianity\". In part 1, he describes the characteristics of the four Gospels of Mark, Matthew, Luke, and John, then offers a close reading of the two birth stories of John, as presented in the Gospel of Matthew, and of Jesus in the Gospel of Luke. In part 2, he zooms out and provides a detailed overview of the seven cultural epochs, especially of the Atlantean epoch and its seven civilizations. By tracing the genealogy from Adam to Jesus, and the incarnations of Zarathustra in AIT Newsletter September 2022 Page 12 the various epochs, he shows the immense preparation that took place for the coming of Christ. Deliv ered with great logical coherence, clarity, and precision, both these lectures are absolutely mind blowing. There is not a single word wasted on unrelated tangents, nor clouded with excessive pathos and personal judgement. Before watching the lectures, I had a very scattered knowledge of the cultural epochs and of Christianity. These lectures connected many of my fragmented ideas and wove together a very clear picture of Steiner's most esoteric and complex teachings. Even though I am yet to finish watching part 3, I cannot wait to recommend Brian Gray's videos on his YouTube Channel, Wise Cosmos. I hope you find something that speaks to you!

From International Societies The Founding of the Anthropo - sophical Society in India By Aban Bana www.anthroposophicalsocietyindia.org October 21, 2011 was a special day. The Anthroposophical Societ y in India was founded in the city of Hyderabad, in the presence of Hans Mulder and many dear Anthroposophical friends from India and abroad. (A brief report of its preparation has appeared in \"Anthroposophy Worldwide\" of June 2011). The ceremony began wit h the entire group doing Eurythmy together. This was followed by the seven members affirming their commitment to their new task within the executive committee of the Society. The brief but profound ceremony ended with the recitation of the Foundation Stone Meditation. The members of the Executive Committee of the newly founded Indian Country Society are: Aban Bana, President (in India) and Country Representative Nirmala Diaz, Vice President Dr. Swapna Narendra, Treasurer Samia Alikhan, Secretary Jakes Jaya karan, Joint Mandaikar, Executive Member Francis Aradhya, Executive Member. Aban Bana, President and Country Representative In India there are over a hundred active and dormant members, both individual as well as belonging to the three Branches: the Gateway Branch in Mumbai, the Rudolf Steiner Branch and the Mercury Branch in Hyderabad. In addition, there are eighteen members of the First Class of the School of Spiritual Science. This year we are celebrating the 150th anniversary of the birth of Dr. Rudolf Steiner. Many are the changes which have occurred in the history of our world since the day Dr. Steiner was born on February 27, 1861. We do not need to delve into details of all that has happened during this time, but suffice us to say that the whole of humanity has undergone a significant development, resulting in an increased awareness of AIT Newsletter September 2022 Page 13 the world. That can be considered a truly positive form of globalisation in the spheres of spiritual striving and culture. One of the most endu ring expressions of this development is the Anthroposophical movement, which has now spread to all parts of the world and has touched the lives of countless people, uniting us in our quest for higher knowledge. Rudolf Steiner was born in the West and was a ctive in that part of the world all his life, but his Anthroposophy has become a global impulse, which can be understood and realised by all individuals, regardless of their religious, social or cultural background. It is a world view based upon the indivi duality of the Human Being. Image for the 2017 Festival of Anthroposophy When we consider the origin of modern natural science, we are aware that it is a product of western civilization and thought, and yet there is hardly any country in the world toda y, which has not been influenced by modern science. If used in a reasonable manner, it can benefit humanity to a high degree, and bring about tremendous progress. However, being one-sided and limited within the physical -material aspect of the world, if not used with care it could degenerate rapidly into spheres of destruction. Image for the 2017 Festival of Anthroposophy Modern day Spiritual Science, as founded by Rudolf Steiner, penetrates into the realms of the sense - world, into the world of nature and the cosmos, and attempts to reach out to the Spirit which is active within it. This is the new path of initiation, which has captured the imagination of many people in India, people who are well acquainted with the ancient spirituality and esoteric knowle dge of the land. It is indeed enlightening to read about Rudolf Steiner's views on reincarnation and Karma, or the holy cow or the Bhagavad Gita! In India Rudolf Steiner is also known as a Modern Rishi (seer). Image for the 2017 Festival of Anthroposoph y Much of what we have learnt about the spiritual worlds from Rudolf Steiner is similar to the wisdom found in ancient Indian scriptures. Yet it must be emphasized that the spiritual insights gained by Rudolf Steiner are a result of his own independent research which he has conducted consciously, by means of his extraordinary clairvoyance and his spiritual -scientific methods and precise thinking. It is by no means simply a revival of ancient texts for the modern world, as is sometimes assumed. Rudolf Stein er borrowed many terms from the ancient Sanskrit language, which he then replaced with German words in keeping with the modern human consciousness. The German language he used for Anthroposophy is similar to Sanskrit; both languages are capable of precisel y expressing spiritual thoughts. What is it in Anthroposophy that holds so much love and interest for people in India, a land which has nine world religions and innumerable spiritual streams? The answer is, the capacity of Anthroposophy to permeate variou s fields of everyday existence with spiritual insight. Whether it is Education, Agriculture, Curative Education, Social Therapy, Medicine, Architecture, Social Sciences or the Arts, AIT Newsletter September 2022 Page 14 Anthroposophy enlivens them all spiritually, and brings new light into the ir practical application for the benefit of humanity. In ancient India too, everyday life was imbued with spiritual knowledge, but today much of that has either been lost or fallen into decadence. With the practical application of Anthroposophy, one connec ts oneself with the earth and activates the will forces; an important aspect in India today. Image for the 2017 Festival of Anthroposophy The number of people active within the Anthroposophical movement in India, a land of one point three billion peopl e (1.300.000.000!) is miniscule, but it is growing. There are seven Waldorf schools in the country, and over fifty schools which are Waldorf -oriented/interested. Then there are homes and institutions for the mentally challenged, Bio Dynamic farms involving hundreds of farmers, a committed group of doctors, psychologists and therapists working in the field of Anthroposophical medicine, as well as hygienic and curative Eurythmy. In each of these subjects there are regular training courses, seminars and worksh ops, which ensure positive growth. We are deeply grateful to Rudolf Steiner, that we are able to experience a new meaning in life. Image for the 2017 Festival of Anthroposophy 8. From Initatives & Institutes The Nature Institute, located in Ghent, New York (see www.natureinstitute.org ) is a n important and dynamic organization conducting original anthroposophical research , publishing valuable findings and offering an intriguing range of courses. Here we find researchers who see the world through a thinking warmed through and through by heart forces. Here is a short article from their website: Whole Organism Biology: A Goethean Approach \"There is a delicate empiricism that makes itself utterly identical with the object, thereby becoming true theory. But this enhancement of our mental powers belongs to a highly evolved age.\" \u2014 Goethe This work is inspired by a scientific approach that has its roots in the research and writings of poet and scientist Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749 -1832). Goethe spent his long life pursuing a living science of the natural world. He spoke of \"delicate empiricism,\" a felicitous way of expressing two fundamental features of our scientific inquiry: We work empirically by attend ing closely to phenomena as they appear in manifold ways in nature and through experiments. And we cultivate a particular way of interacting with the phenomena and our own way [of] thinking: We want to enter into a dialogue through which - gently - underst anding can arise; we don't want to forcefully impose concepts, models, or theories on nature. To understand and portray the living nature of things entails both ridding ourselves of ingrained habits of thought and mobilizing new forces within ourselves. AIT Newsletter September 2022 Page 15 A Goethean approach, as we develop it at The Nature Institute, is concerned with evolving the discipline of science to understand life in a way that is modeled after life itself. For this to occur we have to work to transform ourselves as human beings and b egin forming, as Goethe put it, new organs of perception for the dynamic and living qualities of the world. This is no simple pathway, but an inspiring one, since it shows a way to re -integrate human knowing and doing into the wisdom of the world. The t hree -toed sloth. Sketch by Craig Holdrege In what we call whole organism biology, we study the internal ecology of plants and animals, elucidating how structures and functions interrelate in forming the creature as a whole. And we investigate the whole organism as part of the larger web of life. Our interdisciplinary approach integrates natural history, anatomy, physiology, behavior, development, genetics, and evolution. By creating life history narratives of plants and animals, we open up a new understand ing of our fellow creatures as dynamic and integrated beings. Through this approach, the organism teaches us about itself, revealing its characteristics and its interconnectedness with the world that sustains it. This way of doing science enhances our sen se of responsibility for nature. No one who has read, for example, Craig Holdrege's essay on the sloth *\u2014 coming to appreciate this animal as a unique, focused expression of its entire forest habitat \u2014will be able to tolerate the thought of losing either the sloth or its habitat. *https://www.natureinstitute.org/article/craig - holdrege/what -does -it-mean -to-be-a-sloth 9. From the Collective Works Although in general, I have strong preference for printing entire essays or lectures from Dr. Steiner Collected Works, for the purposes of this issue, I present a series of excerpts that shed light on aspects of the etheric heart . References are provided should the reader wish to review the excerpt in context. Rudolf Steiner on the Etheric Heart: A Selection of Quotations From Theosophy of the Rosicrucian , Lecture 3 \"The Elemental World and the Heaven World\" (May 26, 1907 ; Munich; CW 99) ...The human being, while he is asleep, lives in his astral body outside his physical and etheric bodies. The fact that he must sink into sleep has deep significance for his whole make -up. Do not imagine that the astral body is inactive and has no work to do during the night while it is outside the physical and etheric bodies. During the day, when the astral body is within the physical and etheric bodies, influences come to it from the outside world, impressions which man receives as a result of the functioning of his own astral bo dy, through his senses, through his activity in the physical world. Feelings and experiences, everything that works in upon him from outside continues on into the astral body. This constitutes the actual feeling and thinking part of man, and the physical b ody, together with the etheric body, is only the transmitter, the instrument. Thinking and willing take place in the astral body. While the human body is active in the external world during the day, the astral body is receiving impressions all the time. Bu t let us remember, on the other hand, that the astral body is the builder of the etheric and physical bodies. Just as the physical body with all its organs has hardened out of the etheric body, so everything that streams and is AIT Newsletter September 2022 Page 16 active in the etheric body h as been born out of the astral body. \"The Holy Grail\" by Arthur Rackham, 1917 ... The difference between a man who is dead and one who is only sleeping is that at death the etheric body passes away together with the astral body and the physical body alon e is left behind in the physical world. From birth until death the etheric body never leaves the physical body except during certain states of Initiation. ... Separation of the physical body from the etheric body during life can take place only in an initia te, but there are certain moments when the etheric body suddenly loosens from the physical body. This occurs when a man has had terrible experiences, for instance, a dreadful fall or has been in danger of drowning. The shock causes a kind of loosening of t he etheric body from the physical body and the consequence is that in such a moment the whole of the previous life stands before the soul like a memory - picture. This is analogous to the experience after death. Partial separations of the etheric body also occur when a limb has \"gone to sleep\" as we say if a hand, for instance, has gone to sleep, the seer can perceive the etheric part of the hand protruding like a glove; parts of the etheric brain also protrude when a man is in a state of hypnosis. Because t he etheric body is woven in the physical body in tiny, pinpoint formations, there arises in the physical body the well - known sensation of prickling in a limb that has gone to sleep. From The Gospel of Saint John ; Lecture 2; November 17, 1907, Basel; CW 10 0 ... The difference between inanimate and animate bodies is that in inanimate bodies the materials of which they are constituted follow physical, chemical laws only; but in animate bodies the various materials are combined with one another in a very compli cated manner, and only under the influence of the etheric body can they be held together in this form, which to - them is unnatural and is forced upon them. The physical materials have the constant tendency to group themselves according to their own nature; this signifies the destruction of the living body and the etheric body fights continually against this destruction. When the etheric body withdraws from the physical body, the substances of the physical body group themselves in the manner natural to them, and the body becomes a corpse and falls to pieces. The etheric body, therefore, continually combats the destruction of the physical body. Each organ of the physical body has behind it this etheric body. Man has an etheric heart, an etheric brain, etc., w hich holds together the corresponding physical organ. One is naturally tempted to picture the etheric body in a material way, somewhat like a thin cloud, but in reality the etheric body consists of a number of currents of force. The clairvoyant sees in the etheric body of man certain currents that are exceedingly important. Thus, for example, there is a stream which rises from the left foot to the forehead (see diagram), to a point which lies between the eyes, about half an inch down within the brain; it th en returns to the other foot; from there it passes to the hand on the opposite side; from thence through the heart into the other hand, and from there back to its AIT Newsletter September 2022 Page 17 starting -point. In this way it forms a pentagram of currents of force. This current is not t he only one in the etheric body, there are very many of them. It is to this stream of force that man specially owes his upright position. We do not find this current in animals, they are bound to the earth by their front limbs. In respect of the form and s ize of the human etheric body we may say that in its upper part it is an exact image of the physical body. The lower parts are different; here they do not coincide with the physical body. There is a great secret underlying the relationship between the ethe ric and physical bodies, one which throws a strong light upon human nature. The etheric body of a man is female, that of a woman is male. This explains the fact that in each man's nature there is much that is feminine, and in each woman's nature there is m uch that is masculine. In the animals the etheric body is larger than the physical body. Thus, for example, in the case of the horse the clairvoyant sees that his etheric body projects above his head like a cap. From The Secret of Death. The Nature and Me aning of Middle Europe and the European Folk Spirits , Lecture of June 13, 1915; Elberfeld; CW 159 Man's external physical body (we know this, for it is a trivial truth) grows older and older. But this is not the case with the etheric body. It may perhaps be difficult to understand this, but the etheric body does not in any way grow older; the etheric body grows younger and younger, in the same degree in which the physical body grows older, until it reaches, as it were, a certain childlike stage of etheric existence, when the human being passes through the portal of death after having reached a normal age. We should therefore say to ourselves: When we begin our physical life on earth through birth, then our etheric body, that has become united with our physi cal body, is, comparatively speaking, old, and in the course of our earthly life it grows younger and younger, until it reaches its childhood stage, when we pass through the portal of death. ... As a physical being man belongs to the earth, and just as tru ly does he belong to the heavens as an etheric being. We can only use our physical body as an organ of thinking, because it is organized for that purpose, because the earth sets it free, as it were, for this purpose, when we are awake. And we can only use our etheric body in such a way that it provides us with life -forces, because the heavens place it at our disposal; when we are awake, and because the heavenly forces of imagination are transformed into life-forces within us, when we are awake. Thus we can not speak of our etheric body merely as a misty form, but we should rather speak of it as a microcosmic form reflecting the heavens. When we are born, the etheric body is handed over to us as a especially perfect form. When we are born, our etheric body gl istens and shines inwardly, because it is so full of imaginations that come towards it from the great universe. It is a magnificent refle ction of the universe! All that we acquire during our life as culture, knowledge and forces of the will and of feeling, is all drawn out of our etheric body as we grow old in the course of our existence between birth and death. Heaven's cosmic forces give us what they must give us during our life between birth and death, and so we are once more young as etheric beings, whe n we have lived through a normal life between birth and death, for then we have drawn out of our etheric body everything that could be drawn out of it. Blackboard drawing by Rudolf Steiner From Life and the Human Soul and It Relation to World Evolutio n, Lecture of May 26, 1922, Dornach; GA 212 . ... Before he approaches his physical body \u2014 or rather the germ, the embryo, of it \u2014 man draws into himself the forces of the etheric universe. Here on earth we live in the physical world \u2014 in the world characte rized by all that we see with the senses and understand with earthly intellect. But there is nothing in this AIT Newsletter September 2022 Page 18 world that is not permeated by the etheric world. And before man gets the inclination to unite \u2014 through the embryo \u2014 with the physical world, he d raws to himself the forces of the etheric world, and, in so doing, he forms his own etheric body. But to say that man clothes himself with his etheric body is to say very little. We must enter a little more closely into the nature and constitution of this body. The Etheric Heart (anonymous) The etheric body, as it forms and develops itself in the human being, is a universe in itself \u2014 a universe, one might say, in picture form. At its circumference it manifests something in the nature of stars, and in its lower portion something that appears more or less as an image of the earth. It even has in it a kind of image of the sun nature and the moon nature. This is of great significance. On our descent into the earthly world, when we draw to ourselves the fo rces of the universal ether, we actually take with us in our etheric body a kind of image of the cosmos. If we could extract the etheric body of a man at the moment when he is uniting with the physical, we should have a sphere \u2014 far more beautiful than has ever been wrought by mechanical means \u2014 a sphere complete with stars and zodiac and sun and moon. These configurations of the etheric body remain during the embryonic time, while the human being coalesces more and more with his physical body. They begin t o fade away a little, but they remain. Indeed they remain right on into the seventh year \u2014 that is, until the change of teeth. In the etheric body of the little child, this cosmic sphere is still quite recognizable. But with the seventh year \u2014 with the change of teeth \u2014 these forms that we behold in the etheric body begin to ray out, in a manner of speaking, previously they were more star -like; now they begin to be like rays. The stars dissolve away in the human ether body; but as they do so they become rays, rays with a tendency to come together inwardly. All this goes on gradually throughout the period of life between the change of teeth and puberty. At puberty the process is so far advanced that these rays, having grown together here in the center, form as it were a distinct structure \u2014 a distinct etheric structure of their own. The stars have faded out, while the structure which has gathered in the center becomes especially living. And in the midst of this central etheric structure, at the time of pubert y, the physical heart, with its blood vessels, is suspended. So we have this strange phenomenon of the star - ether -body drawing inwards. As etheric body it is, of course, undifferentiated at the periphery of the organism \u2014 very little can be distinguished in there. On the other hand, during the time from the change of teeth until puberty, it is intensely radiant, raying from without inwards. Then it gathers itself together, and there, clearly suspended within it, is the physical heart. You must not suppose that until then man has no etheric heart. Certain he has one, but he obtains it differently from the way in which he acquires the etheric heart that will now be his. For the gathered radiance that arises at the time of puberty becomes the true etheric hea rt of man. The etheric heart he has before this time is one that he received as a heritage through the inherent forces of the embryo. When a man gets his etheric body, and with it makes his way into the physical organism, a kind of etheric heart \u2014 a substi tute etheric heart, so to speak \u2014 is AIT Newsletter September 2022 Page 19 drawn together by the forces of the physical body. He keeps this etheric heart during his childhood years, but then it gradually decays. (This may not be a very beautiful expression, by our usual standards, but it meets the case exactly.) The first etheric heart slowly decays, and in its stead, as it were constantly replacing that which falls out in the etheric process of decay, there comes the new, the real, etheric heart. This etheric heart is a concentration of the wh ole cosmic sphere we brought with us as an ether form, a faithful image of the cosmos, when we proceeded through conception and birth into this earthly life. Thus we can trace, throughout the time from birth or conception until puberty, a distinct change in the whole etheric form that the human being bears within him. One may describe it by saying: not until puberty does the human being possess his own etheric heart \u2014 that is, the etheric heart formed out of his own etheric body, and not supplied provision ally by external forces. All the etheric forces that are working in man until puberty tend to endow him with this fresh etheric heart. It is, in the etheric sphere, a process comparable to the change of teeth. For, as you know, until the change of teeth w e have our inherited teeth; these are cast out, and their place is taken by the second teeth \u2014 those that are truly our own. So, likewise, the etheric heart we have until puberty is cast out, and we now receive our own. That is the point \u2014 we receive our o wn etheric heart. From Youth and the Etheric Heart: Rudolf Steiner Speaks to the Younger Generation ; Lecture of January 6, 1923; Dornach; CW 217A ...Our hearts, too, have changed. We have a different kind of heart in our body. Our physical heart has become hard, but our etheric heart is more flexible. We must find the way to make use of this supersensible heart of ours. It then will help us to understand spiritual science. To put it plainly, just about everybody and his uncle are talking about spiritual sci ence but only because most science can be taken in lazily. We have to be quite clear about it: spiritual science must come alive in our hearts. And the hearts of young people are perfectly formed to feel what is true in this sphere \u2014 if there's enough cour age for such thoughts. Friedrich Schiller with his warm enthusiasm had much to give the world. He died in very peculiar circumstances. There was an autopsy. His heart was examined; it was found to have become an empty pouch, completely dried up, burned ou t. All our hearts will burn out like this unless we can lay hold of them and make them new. And if we are to be serious about spirituality we will have to tell ourselves with a certain amount of courage: \"Whenever we seem not to be able to live with the rest of the world, it is because we need to have a new kind of heart!\" However, this should not be just a phrase. Let us be awake to the fact that our new hearts should be aware of the world in quite a different way from the old hearts. If we take thi s very seriously the youth movement will become something like a flame blazing towards the flames of the sunrise. This will not result from discussions about being young or from talk about inner feelings; in this regard peculiar things can AIT Newsletter September 2022 Page 20 happen. In Bresl au the elderly members in their welcome called me \"Papa\"; in the youth group there they said I was the youngest of all, though I was three times older than most of them. Illustrations from the scientific work of Walter Russell (1871 -1963) Indeed it is important to be able to admit this about oneself. The flames from within, the flames from outside, the two flames must strike against each other. It is not at all important to decide or define anything. It is important that we bring about a new kind of ent husiasm. It comes down to this: we should not only learn to sit down but we should learn to stand up. Nietzsche had an apt phrase for Carlyle, who impresses many people with his talent for enthusiasm. \"Carlyle's enthusiasm,\" said Nietzsche, \"is the kind th at takes off its coat.\" In other words, Carlyle always had time to take off his coat whenever he was seized by enthusiasm. Carlyle always had time as he got warmly enthusiastic, without hesitation, to take off his coat. One can imagine how this fellow woul d pull on a silk vest after he has had time to get fully into his enthusiasm and slowly to take off his coat. But the right enthusiasm is the kind that doesn't give you time to take off your coat; it makes you sweat, wearing your coat, and you don't even notice how you're perspiring! This is the right enthusiasm, my dear friends! It should overpower us so completely that we keep our coats on. That enthusiasm we should feel compelled to bring into being out of the fullness and immediacy of life itself. We need today to overcome our heavy, sticky tiredness. It is actually lazy to insist on \"being clear.\" There may well be no time to become clear in the old sense of the word. But there is the real necessity to become enthusiastic \u2014 for enthusiasm will be able to accomplish everything. The word itself will then reach its true meaning. The German word Begeisterung carries Geist, spirit, in itself. That is self -evident: we need spirit. The English -Greek word enthusiasm has the divine within it (Gr. Theos). A god is in the word. Grow inwardly with the flame that is kindled in you today, for then the Michael impulse will be achieved! Without fire, it cannot be achieved. But if you are to live and work, glowing through and through, you yourself will have to become a flame. The only thing not burned up by flames is a flame; when we can begin to feel we are becoming one, and cannot be burned up by other flames, we can safely let our physical heart remain behind as an empty pouch, for we have an etheric heart. It is our etheric heart that will understand that humanity is moving into a new epoch, into a life in the spirit. Our growing into this life in the spirit will form the youth movement, the youth experience, in all its strength. From Chapter 5 of Knowledge of the Hi gher Worlds and Its Attainment (Collected Works 10) The development of the soul -body in the manner described above permits perception in a supersensible world, but anyone wishing to find his way in this world must not remain stationary at this stage of development. The mere mobility of the lotus flowers is not sufficient. The student must acquire the power of regulating and controlling the movement of his spiritual organs independently and with complete consciousness; otherwise he would become a plaything for external forces and powers. To avoid this he must acquire the faculty of hearing what is called the inner world, and this involves the development not only of the soul -body but also of the etheric body. The latter is that tenuous body revealed to the clairvoyant as a kind of double of the physical body, and forms to a certain extent an intermediate step between the soul nature and the physical body. (See the description on the author's book Theosophy.) It is possible for one equipped with clairvoyant po wers consciously to suggest away the physical body of a person. This corresponds on a higher plane to an exercise in attentiveness on a lower plane. Just as a person can divert his attention from something in front of him so that it becomes non -existent fo r him, the clairvoyant can extinguish a physical body from his field of observation so that it becomes physically AIT Newsletter September 2022 Page 21 transparent to him. If he exerts this faculty in the case of some person standing before him, there remains visible to his clairvoyant sight o nly the etheric body, besides the soul -body which is larger than the other two \u2014 etheric and physical bodies \u2014 and interpenetrates them both. The etheric body has approximately the size and form of the physical body, so that it practically fills the same s pace. It is an extremely delicate and finely organized structure. (I beg the physicist not to be disturbed at the expression \"etheric body\". The word ether here is merely used to suggest the fineness of the body in question, and need not in any way be conn ected with the hypothetical ether of physics.) Its ground -color is different from any of the seven colors contained in the rainbow. Anyone capable of observing it will find a color which is actually non - existent for sense perception but to which the color of the young peach -blossom may be comparable. If desired, the etheric body can be examined alone; for this purpose the soul -body must be extinguished by an effort of attentiveness in the manner described above. Otherwise the etheric body will present an ever changing picture owing to its interpenetration by the soul -body. Now, the particles of the etheric body are in continual motion. Countless currents stream through it in every direction. By these currents, life itself is maintained and regulated. Ev ery body that has life, including animals and plants, possesses an etheric body. Even in minerals traces of it can be observed. These currents and movements are, to begin with, independent of human will and consciousness, just as the action of the heart or stomach is beyond our jurisdiction, and this independence remains unaltered so long as we do not take our development in hand in the sense of acquiring supersensible faculties. For, at a certain stage, development consists precisely in adding to the uncon scious currents and movements of the etheric body others that are consciously produced and controlled. When esoteric development has progressed so far that the lotus flowers begin to stir, much has already been achieved by the student which can result i n the formation of certain quite definite currents and movements in his etheric body. The object of this development is the formation of a kind of center in the region of the physical heart, from which radiate currents and movements in the greatest possibl e variety of colors and forms. The center is in reality not a mere point, but a most complicated structure, a most wonderful organ. It glows and shimmers with every shade of color and displays forms of great symmetry, capable of rapid transformation. Other forms and streams of color radiate from this organ to the other parts of the body, and beyond it to the astral body, completely penetrating and illuminating it. The most important of these currents flow to the lotus flowers. They permeate each petal and r egulate its revolutions; then streaming out at the points of the petals, they lose themselves in outer space. The higher the development of a person, the greater the circumference to which these rays extend. The twelve -petalled lotus flower has a particul arly close connection with this central organ. The currents flow directly into it and through it, proceeding on the one side to the sixteen and the two -petalled lotus flowers, and on the other, the lower side, to the flowers of eight, six and four petals. It is for this reason that the very greatest care must be devoted to the development of the twelve -petalled lotus, for an imperfection in the latter would result in irregular formation of the whole structure. The above will give an idea of the delicate and intimate nature of esoteric AIT Newsletter September 2022 Page 22 training, and of the accuracy needed if the development is to be regular and correct. It will also be evident beyond doubt that directions for the Angel of Justice by Anelia Pavlova (2010) development of supersensible facu lties can only be the concern of those who have themselves experienced everything which they propose to awaken in others, and who are unquestionably in a position to know whether the directions they give lead to the exact results desired. If the student fo llows the directions that have been given him, he introduces into his etheric body currents and movements which are in harmony with the laws and the evolution of the world to which he belongs. Consequently these instructions are reflections of the great la ws of cosmic evolution. They consist of the above -mentioned and similar exercises in meditation and concentration which, if correctly practiced, produce the results described. The student must at certain times let these instructions permeate his soul with their content, so that he is inwardly entirely filled with it. A simple start is made with a view to the deepening of the logical activity of the mind and the producing of an inward intensification of thought. Thought it thereby made free and independent o f all sense impressions and experiences; it is concentrated in one point which is held entirely under control. Thus a preliminary center is formed for the currents of the etheric body. This center is not yet in the region of the heart but in the head, and it appears to the clairvoyant as the point of departure for movements and currents. No esoteric training can be successful which does not first create this center. If the latter were first formed in the region of the heart the aspiring clairvoyant would do ubtless obtain glimpses of the higher worlds, but would lack all true insight into the connection between these higher worlds and the world of our senses. This, however, is an unconditional necessity for man at the present stage of evolution. The clairvoya nt must not become a visionary; he must retain a firm footing upon the earth. The center in the head, once duly fixed, is then moved lower down, to the region of the larynx. This is effected by further exercises in concentration. Then the currents of the etheric body radiate from this point and illumine the astral space surrounding the individual. Continued practice enables the student to determine for himself the position of this etheric body. Hitherto this position depended upon external forces proceedi ng from the physical body. Through further development the student is able to turn his etheric body to all sides. This faculty is effected by currents moving approximately along both hands and centered in the two -petalled lotus in the region of the eyes. A ll this is made possible through the radiations from the larynx assuming round forms, of which a number flow to the two -petalled lotus and thence form undulating currents along the hands. As a further development, these currents branch out and ramify in th e most delicate manner and become, as it were, a kind of web which then encompasses the entire etheric body as though with a network. Whereas hitherto the etheric body was not closed to the outer world, so that the life currents from the universal ocean of life flowed freely in and out, these currents now have to pass through this membrane. Thus the individual becomes sensitive to these external streams; they become perceptible to him. And now the time has come to give the complete system of currents and m ovements its center situated in the region of the heart. This again is effected by persevering with the exercises in concentration and meditation; and at this point also the stage is reached AIT Newsletter September 2022 Page 23 when the student becomes gifted with the inner word. All things n ow acquire a new significance for him. They become as it were spiritually audible in their innermost self, and speak to him of their essential being. The currents described above place him in touch with the inner being of the world to which he belongs. He begins to mingle his life with the life of his environment and can let it reverberate in the movements of his lotus flowers. Cover of a book by John Hinkle published in 2019 At this point the spiritual world is entered. If the student has advanced so f ar, he acquires a new understanding for all that the great teachers of humanity have uttered. The sayings of the Buddha and the Gospels, for instance, produce a new effect on him. They pervade him with a rapture of which he had not dreamed before. For the tone of their words follows the movements and rhythms which he has himself formed within himself. He can now have positive knowledge that a Buddha or the Evangelists did not utter their own revelations but those which flowed into them from the inmost being of all things. A fact must here be pointed out which can only be understood in the light of what has been said above. The many repetitions in the sayings of the Buddha are not comprehensible to people of our present evolutionary stage. For the esoteric st udent, however, they become a force on which he gladly lets his inner senses rest, for they correspond with certain movements in the etheric body. Devotional surrender to them, with perfect inner peace, creates an inner harmony with these movements; and be cause the latter are an image of certain cosmic rhythms which also at certain points repeat themselves and revert to former modes, the student listening to the wisdom of the Buddha unites his life with that of the cosmic mysteries. 10. From Another Anthr oposophist From \"Ch. 3 The Heart and the Fate of Humanity\" in The Mystery of the Heart: The Sacramental Physiology of the Hear t in Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas, and Rudolf Steiner by Dr. Peter Selg ...The karmic forces of the future are transformed in the war mth structure of the heart. These forces are taken up into its etheric warming space, which is formed out of the cosmos with the most intensive concentration. During a lecture on developmental physiology, Steiner explains that people are able to inscribe i ndividual actions (by means of the soul -body at work), and also intended actions (by means of the \"I\" at work), into this etheric warmth space following the time of puberty, which he called the \"earthly maturity\"339 With an emphasis on astral and etheric events, 340 Steiner said: Starting at the time of sexual maturity, all human activity begins in the etheric heart, taking a detour through the astral body. The etheric heart is the organ that arose from the reflection of the stars and the cosmos. Everythi ng begins there. This is an extraordinarily important occurrence because, when you observe all of this, you find the union of what the human being does on Earth with the cosmic. If you think in terms of the etheric world, you find a compact form of the cosmos in the heart. At the same time, if you think in terms of the astral world, you see in contracted form all that is undertaken by the human being. AIT Newsletter September 2022 Page 24 The human being and the cosmos, with all its cosmic events, find their connection in the heart. In all of the human body, only in the area around the heart do we find such a close correspondence between the astral body and the etheric body. Through birth, the human being has brought a reflection of the entire world into the etheric body. In fact, it is the cas e that this entire world, the essence of which is within us, takes into itself and permeates itself with everything the human being does. Through these connections there is an opportunity; every deed in every human life from this point on becomes part of t he essence of these reflections of the cosmos. When human beings pass through the portal of death, we have laid aside the physical body. We take everything with us into the further [next] spirit -soul life in this etheric -astral form in which the heart swi ms. Since we become increasingly large spiritually, we can give up our entire karma to the cosmos. After all, the substance of the entire cosmos is there inside, contracted into the heart, in the etheric body... When we observe the development of the human being, we can actually tell ourselves that, in the region of the heart, there is a conjoining of the cosmic and the earthly. The cosmic, in its cosmic configuration, is taken into the etheric. There is prepares itself to accept and take in everything we do . We go forth and step into a new cosmic existence when we have gone through the portal of death. We take with us what has formed itself through an inner penetration of the etheric with human deeds.141 This is how the human heart becomes and remains an \"organism for the development of karma.\"142 Where your treasure lies, there, too, lies your heart...(Luke 12:34). Notes: 339. CW 317 (not available in English), p. 18 340. On this topic, see also Thomas Aquinas's corresponding allusions in De motu cordis , according to which the formative forces, together with the later life form of the heart, are subject to the Anima Sensitiva , living in perceiving, moving, and desiring forces. They also establish a unifying collaboration of the sensing soul with the living body. 341. CW 212 (English trans.: Introducing Anthroposophical Medicine ), pp. 123ff. 342. Ibid. p. 127 11. Editorial Notes on the Theme Editorial Notes on the Theme of the Etheric Heart by Robert McKay In my own anthroposophical journey, I am trying to develop a more precise understanding of how the human being transforms through embarking on the meditative path. As Dr. Steiner says , at the opening of Chapter 6 of Knowledge of the Higher Worlds and Its Attainment : One of the fundamental principles o f true spiritual science is that the one who devotes himself to its study should do so with full consciousness; he should attempt nothing and practice nothing without knowledge of the effect produced. In order to understand these effects, one must work toward a richer understand of the human being in general. In anthroposophy, this is no small task. I am finding th at the two sister projects are linked: the more I understand the human being in general, the more I understand about the effects of meditation . I am just beginning to understand more about the various organ systems of the living physical body and the sustaining cascading creative impulse that flows 'down' from astral into etheric into the physical. In this issue I tried to find selections from Rudolf Steiner and Peter Selg that speak directly or indirectly to the formation and importance of the etheric heart. Re-reading these selections fill s me with wonder , especially at the depth of Dr. Steiner's knowledge. Re- reading these selections also leave me feeling overwhelmed. This is often the case as I begin to study a new arena of anthroposophy. I find myself worried that I am just not smart enough to understand all this. There is a temptation to turn away from what looks like an impossible task. I am no longer so easily seduced by this impulse to give up . I have learned that if I read and re -read, ponder and 're-ponder ', the anthroposophy that at first appears like a sheer unclimbable rockface reveals a hidden stair way. There is always a way up and I will find it . It is rarely straight forward. I work a bit, develop a better question, AIT Newsletter September 2022 Page 25 realize I have this or that wrong, read some more...Gradually, w hat at first seems almost incomprehensible become s a new inner richness , changing me in the world. One initial realization of an almost poetic nature stays with me about the etheric heart. Our very li ves are written here ! Every day, we are inscribing in thought and feeling and action who we are in the book of our etheric heart. I also know that human develo pment is a team sport. So, t here is a part of your book in mine; a part of my book in yours. Perhaps we com pare notes out amongst the star s, in the sanctity of sleep. Following the turning point in time, Christ is the Lord of Karma. When we pass through the gate of death, He will read our book of the heart as it streams out into the cosmic ether . He will read what we have written \u2014what we have made of ourselves \u2014 and this will form through Him, the basis of what we shall become in our future lives. Let us h ope that at least some part of it makes Him smile! Here is a poem that came to mind when writing this, a poet who , it seems, could not endure the sight of a capital letter... i carry your heart with me by e.e. cummings i carry your heart with me (i carry it in my heart) i am never without it (anywhere i go you go, my dear; and whatever is done by only me is your doing, my darling) i fear no fate (for you are my fate, my sweet) i want no world (for beau tiful you are my world, my true) and it's you are whatever a moon has always meant and whatever a sun will always sing is you here is the deepest secret nobody knows (here is the root of the root and the bud of the bud and the sky of the sky of a tree cal led life; which grows higher than soul can hope or mind can hide) and this is the wonder that's keeping the stars apart i carry your heart (i carry it in my heart) 12. The Historian's Corner Celebrating Helene Finckh by Robert McKay One of the great u nsung heroes of the anthroposophical movement is Helene Finckh. As you all know, Dr. Rudolf Steiner's collected works are massive: over 330 volumes with very little true repetition, although the same topic is often presented from various sides. The m ajority of the collected works are lectures. None of these lectures were audio recorded. They would be lost except to history but for the work of several dedicated stenographers. One of the earliest was Walter Vegelahn, a businessman who knew a form of s tenography and was taking notes for himself. Many of the pre -1909 lectures (CW 88 to 115) are largely based on his notes, supplemented with less detailed notes from others. During those early years, some audience members, who were not as accurate as Mr. Vegelahn, began sharing their notes which then led to typescripts being circulated; typescripts that often contain serious errors and misrepresentations. As a result, Dr. Steiner Helene Finckh (1883 - 1960) AIT Newsletter September 2022 Page 26 eventually agreed that professional stenographers should be hired to ensure a more accurate record of his lectures would be created. At first, he resisted having stenographers present at all, preferring that the lectures be experienced only by those present. Initially he insisted that the stenographer be hidden behind a screen, o ut of sight, but after a time, this requirement was dropped. To the end of his life Dr. Steiner was not fond of having his lectures taken down verbatim, as he expresses in the following quote from late in this life: Today when a lecture is given even to t he most exclusive circle, the question always arises of finding a stenographer. I do not like stenographers. One must put up with them, of course, but I would much rather they were not there.\" (Rudolf Steiner, Agriculture Course, Q&A session on 14th June 1 4, 1924; CW 327) Of course, we know that he felt this way only because a stenographer was present to record this comment! Dr. Steiner entrusted the task of overseeing the stenographers to his wife Marie Steiner. She hired them, supervised their transcrip ts, and prepared the lecture texts for publication. As Dr. Steiner only reviewed and corrected a few of these lecture series, most were published with the original proviso: \"Errors occurring in transcripts which I myself have been unable to revise will jus t have to be tolerated.\" Of the over 6000 lectures Dr. Rudolf Steiner gave during his lifetime, about 3700 were documented by a stenography. In most cases, the Rudolf Steiner Archive still has the original stenography pads. This work was done by five peop le over the years: Walter these five, Helene Finckh (1883 - 1960), is the most important, and arguably the most accurate. A professionally trained stenograph er, she was hired by Marie S teiner in 1916. In addition to tak ing the notes of lectures, she served as Dr. Steiner's secretary. After Dr. Steiner died, she continued on as Marie Steiner's secretary until 1948. For the rest of her life, she worked on the development and publication of Rudolf Steiner's Collected Works, along with many other collaborators. Helen Finckh is responsible for having made the verbatim records of roughly 2,500 lectures. Her notes include asides, digressions, pauses, notes on Dr. Steiner's hand gestures, and inco mplete sentences. As such, her notes catch some of the vitality of the actual spoken word. Much of this detail is lost as these verbatim notes are transformed into the form of the lectures we have today. So here is a \"shout out\" to Helen e Finckh, to whom, I think you will agree, we owe a great debt! 13. The Artist's Corner Introducing Anelia Pavlova Anelia Palova , who goes by Annael, is a wonderful artist whose work has a magical quality, deeply informed by her richer understanding of soul and spiri t. She is an artist work ing her way deeper into the mysteries of the cosmos. Text and images form her website: www.annael.com . AIT Newsletter September 2022 Page 27 Journey of a Star (2009) I graduated with a Master Degree in Fine Arts (majoring in Illus tration and Book Design) in 1981 under the guidance of Prof. Roumen Skorchev. After graduating, I continued to work in the areas of illustration and printmaking. Since Art expresses high ideals through beauty, a good mastering of the craft is needed (in a ddition to other things). What has always interested me, however, are the colours. As a child the colours attracted me strongly and I studied the paintings of the Old Masters, looked at the hues of the flowers and the Nature as a whole. So, I have always d esired to study oil painting. Indeed, I have always wanted to make colours. After numerous experiments, in 1985 I finally achieved an innovative and unique technique through which I found a way to make colours in the intaglio (engraving) process. In princ iple, bright colours in printmaking are very difficult to achieve, except manually or with lithography. A friend and colleague of mine from Austin, TX, who is also a lecturer in printmaking, pointed out to me later that my technique is very similar to the \"a la poupee\" technique of the Old 16th century French engravers. The name comes from the French word for \"doll\", since they used a small rag ball wrapped with leather for spreading the ink. Well, I did not use a doll, and despite the similarities, the tec hnique I created is unique in itself. The Angel of Life (2009) Octava Spera I (2010) AIT Newsletter September 2022 Page 28 All my wine labels are also done using this technique. My first series of prints after the Old Dutch Masters was created with this technique, and the works were acqu ired by the Pushkin State Museum of Fine Arts, Moscow and the National Art Gallery, Sofia. In February 1993 I moved to Australia. In 1994 I made the first exhibition of my prints in Australia in BMG Gallery, the best gallery in Adelaide at the time. What allowed me to make this exhibition then was the generosity of an old British lady who kept an art - supplies shop 50km out of the city - her act of faith and love for art was unforgettable for me. The exhibition turned out to be very successful - all the works (except one print) were sold -out by the end; this allowed me to purchase the specialized materials I needed to continue with my printmaking work. In 1995 I was offered to make one of the Queen of Clubs (Semillon) labels for Peter Lehmann Wines, which m arked the beginning of a number of commissions for wine labels that I made over several years. The Queen of Clubs label used on the Semillon wine for Peter Lehmann has now become quite famous, with a controversy about its export to the US well documented o n the internet by Peter May. Other labels included Shiraz Grenache for Peter Lehmann Wines and a label for Brangayne (whose story is on the Brangayne site). The Brangayne label shows the preparation of the Drink of Love; it was used in different designs fo r various wines. Virgin Sophia of the Night (2012) A series of four labels after Irish legends for Setanta Wines was my last project in this area. I enjoyed researching Irish mythology very much, but I must admit that it was very difficult to create an image reflecting the time, since all that is left from this period are crude rock drawings, which are not always very clear. A lot of imagination was needed to create a heroic and fearful image of Setanta - a hero from the Irish legends - while preserving , at the same time, the beauty of the good deeds and the necessity of lightness in the images, so that people would wish to try the wines and not be scared away by a ferocious - looking Setanta! My labels have a certain place in my ouevre, as do my prints. However, I have always found that printmaking is limited by its technology and does not allow me to express what I wish. Thus, I decided that I must once and for all turn to oil painting as the correct medium to express my ideas. I thus began to paint, lea rning the necessary techniques as I went along, with an emphasis on the Old Masters - or at least, in the way that I thought their technique can be adapted in our time. Soon enough I realized that what I had achieved in printmaking with the invention of a new technique was actually my desire to bring the colours and world of painting to the printmaking medium. Painting now became my artistic expression in a way that I felt it should have always been. As my ideas developed, I also began to create my works u sing classical music. I have always enjoyed working with music, even as a student; but I discovered that in classical music there was something that would coincide with my works - when the music is sublime, one is taken into a world of lofty thoughts and p ure feelings that is a reflection of something inherently human, and at the same time completely Divine. Of course, it is not just the music that affects the work - the music must be suitable for the idea that I have; also, the performance is of the greate st importance, since only a good performance can extract from the silent score the true \"vision\" of the composer. \"Musical Offerings\" (2001) in TVH Gallery, Sydney, contained my first attempts to use music in such a way; since then this has become integral for me. Thus I turned to music for inspiration, and also to the Old Masters - two influences that are undeniable in my art, which, in all other respects, is unique in itself.
