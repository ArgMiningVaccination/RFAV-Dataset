You can find a suite of information and materials that are needed for each specific COVID -19 vaccine that cover administration, storage and handling, safety, and reporting here . Below are some frequently asked quest ions regarding the vaccine s: Benefits, dosage, and prevention Q: What are the benefits of the COVID -19 vaccine? Because there is currently no cure for COVID -19, prevention is our best strategy. The development of COVID -19 vaccines is an important step in h elping minimize the effects of this potentially deadly virus. Vaccines work by training your immune system to recognize and fight off the viruses and bacteria they target. By triggering an immune system response to a virus through a vaccine, your body is b etter equipped to destroy these disease -causing microbes in the future should you be exposed and the microbe gains entry into your body. Q: How does the COVID -19 vaccine work? COVID -19 mRNA vaccines give instructions for our cells to make a harmless piece of what is called the \"spike protein.\" The spike protein is found on the surface of the virus that causes COVID -19. COVID -19 mRNA vaccines are given in the upper arm muscle. Once the instructions (mRNA) are inside the muscle cells, the cells use them to ma ke the protein piece. Our immune systems recognize that the protein doesn't belong there and begin building an immune response and making antibodies, like what happens in natural infection against COVID -19. At the end of the process, our bodies have learned how to protect against future infection. The benefit of mRNA vaccines, like all vaccines, is those vaccinated gain this protection without ever having to risk the serious consequences of getting sick with COVID -19. Q: How soon will vaccines become available? There will be a limited supply of COVID -19 vaccines in December 2020, but supply will continually increase in the weeks and months that follow. The goal is for everyone to be able to easily get a COVID -19 vaccination as soon as large quantities are available. The plan is to have several thousand vaccination providers available, including doctors' offices, retail pharmacies, hospitals, and federally qualified health centers. Q: When will I have the chance to receive the vaccine? To protect health care personnel and the most vulnerable, the CDC has advised that health care workers and residents of long -term care facilities be offered the COVID -19 vaccine in the initial phase of the nation's vaccination program. Q: Will I need more than one dose of the COVID -19 vaccine? Yes, receiving two doses of the BioNTech/Pfizer mRNA COVID -19 vaccine is the only way to create an effective antibody response and protect you from COVID -19. The first shot starts building protection. A second shot a few weeks later is needed to get the most protection the vaccine has to offer. Highest 2immunity through the vaccine is achieved one week after receiving both doses. The duration of immunity is currently unknown. Q: If I wear a mask and social distance, do I need a vaccin e? The combination of getting vaccinated and following guidelines such as mask wearing and social distancing offer the best protection from COVID -19. Q: Will I benefit from the vaccine if I have already recovered from COVID -19? Due to the severe health ris ks associated with COVID -19 and the fact that re -infection with COVID -19 is possible, people may be advised to get a COVID -19 vaccine even if they have been sick with COVID -19 before. At this time, experts do not know how long someone is protected from get ting sick again after recovering from COVID -19. The immunity someone gains from having an infection, called natural immunity, varies from person to person. Some early evidence suggests natural immunity may not last very long. Q: How long will my immunity l ast after vaccination? It is unknown at this time how long immunity will last; ongoing studies will help determine if repeat vaccination is needed and if it is, how often we may need a booster Vaccine development , storage and distribution Q: How was the COVID -19 vaccine developed so quickly? The work of scientists began nearly a year ago in January 2020 on a COVID -19 vaccine. Vaccine funding have come together to move vaccine candidates through the pre -clinical/clinical assessments and trials both quickly and thoughtfully. This has enabled researchers to advance into phase 3 clinical trials (testing the vaccine on large groups of people to evaluate safety and effectiveness) in six months instead of the typical two years. The vaccine was mass produced befor e the clinical studies were complete to save time. To learn more about the rigorous scientific and regulatory processes in place to facilitate development and ensure safety, effectiveness and quality of the COVID -19 vaccines, please refer to the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) website. Q: Are any of the COVID -19 vaccines that are in development better than the others? The safety and efficacy can vary by vaccine. That said, all vaccines undergo the same stringent review processes, regardless of man ufacturer. FDA approval or EUA means the agency has determined, based on rigorous review and evidence that the vaccine is safe and effective for intended use. Q: What is Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)? A: The FDA can issue an EUA during a public health emergency, like a pandemic, to allow the use of unapproved medical products to diagnose, treat or prevent serious or life -threatening diseases. If there's evidence that strongly suggests that patients have beneted from a treatment or test, the FDA can is sue an EUA to make it available. Safety and efficacy must be demonstrated, and certain criteria must be met, including that there are no adequate, approved and available alternatives. The EUA was issued, because longer term follow up is needed for formal F DA approval, which will likely occur after six months of observation. 3Q: How should the COVID -19 vaccine be stored? In order to address the critical time constraints in distributing this material, New York State will work with local jurisdictions to identi fy and operationalize appropriate regionally based storage locations, each that comply with CDC and manufacturer recommendations for storage including at temperatures as low as minus 80 degrees Celsius. Q: How will COVID -19 vaccines be distributed ? The fe deral government will oversee a centralized system to order, distribute, and track COVID -19 vaccines. All vaccines will be ordered through CDC. Vaccine providers will receive vaccines from CDC's centralized distributor or directly from a vaccine manufactur er. Vaccine safety and concerns Q: Can the vaccine cause COVID -19? No. None of the COVID -19 vaccines currently in development in the US, including the BioNTech/Pfizer COVID -19 vaccine, use the live virus that causes COVID -19. T here are several different types of vaccines in development. However, the goal for each of them is to teach our immune systems how to recognize and fight the virus that causes COVID -19. Q: Is the COVID -19 vaccine safe and effective? The FDA is responsible for protecting pu blic health by ensuring the safety and efficacy of drugs, inclusive of vaccines. They have now given the BioNTech/Pfizer COVID -19 vaccine EUA because it met the needed safety and efficacy criteria. Q: Are the first to receive the vaccine serving as a tes t for safety and effectiveness? The safety and efficacy of the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine established in phase 3 clinical trials was a primary factor in the FDA issuing EUA for its use. The FDA will continue to monitor the safety and efficacy of all COVID -19 vaccines that receive EUA before providing full approval for those that meet federal safety and efficacy standards. Q: Will receiving the vaccine cause any side effects? Some people may experience more symptoms compared to prior vaccinations. The booster shot can produce symptoms more severe than experienced with the first dose. This is all normal and not serious and will disappear with time. The most common side effect is muscle soreness or achiness in the arm, which will resolve without treatment. Other common side effects after vaccination may include: Swelling or redness where the vaccine was administered Low-grade fever Chills Fatigue Headache Muscle and joint achiness elsewhere Self-care for side effects includes: 4Over the counter medication such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen for fever or muscle/joint aches An alternating warm/cool compress at the vaccination site for soreness Rest Staying well hydrated Q: How do I report it if I have a problem or reaction after getting a COVID -19 vaccine? CDC and FDA encourage the public to report possible side effects (called adverse events) to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). This national system collects these data to look for adverse events that are unexpected, appear to happe n more often than expected, or have unusual patterns of occurrence. Reports to VAERS help CDC monitor the safety of vaccines. Safety is a top priority. Healthcare providers will be required to report certain adverse events following vaccination to VAERS. Healthcare providers also have to adhere to any revised safety reporting requirements according to FDA's conditions of authorized use throughout the duration of any Emergency Use Authorization; these requirements would be posted on FDA's website . Q: Can anyone get the vaccine (e.g., children, the elderly, people who are immunocompromised, women who are breastfeeding/pr egnant/considering becoming pregnant, those with a significant history of allergic reactions)? If you have questions about the COVID -19 vaccine and children, elderly, people who are immunocompromised, women who are breastfeeding/pregnant/considering becom ing pregnant, and those with a significant history of allergic reactions, please learn more from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on the CDC website and consult your health care provider. Q: Is it safe to get a COVID -19 vaccine if I hav e an underlying medical condition? Yes. COVID -19 vaccination is especially important for people with underlying health problems like heart disease, lung disease, diabetes, and obesity. People with these conditions are more likely to get very sick from COVI D-19. Q: Are there long -term side effects from COVID -19 vaccine? Because all COVID -19 vaccines are new, it will take more time and more people getting vaccinated to learn about very rare or possible long -term side effects. The good news is, at least 8 weeks' worth of safety data were gathered in the clinical trials for all the authorized vaccines, and it's unusual for vaccine side effects to appear more than 8 weeks after vaccination.

You may have some side effects, which are normal signs that your body is building protection. These side effects may feel like flu and may even affect your ability to do daily activities, but they should go away in a few days. Common side effects On the arm where you got the shot: Pain SwellingThroughout the rest of your body: Fever Tiredness ChillsHeadache Helpful tips If you have pain or discomfort, talk to your doctor about taking an over-the-counter medicine, such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen. To reduce pain and discomfort where you got the shot: Apply a clean, cool, wet washcloth over the area. Use or exercise your arm.To reduce discomfort from fever: Drink plenty of fluids. Dress lightly.Ask your healthcare provider about getting started with v-safe Use your smartphone to tell CDC about any side effects after getting the COVID-19 vaccine. You'll also get reminders if you need a second dose Learn more about v-safe . www.cdc.gov/vsafeWhen to call the doctor In most cases, discomfort from fever or pain is normal. Contact your doctor or healthcare provider: If the redness or tenderness where you got the shot increases after 24 hours If your side effects are worrying you or do not seem to be going away after a few days Remember Side effects may feel like flu and even affect your ability to do daily activities, but they should go away in a few days. With most COVID-19 vaccines, you will need 2 shots in order for them to work. Get the second shot even if you have side effects after the first one, unless a vaccination provider or your doctor tells you not to get a second shot. It takes time for your body to build protection after any vaccination. COVID-19 vaccines that require 2 shots may not protect you until a week or two after your second shot. It's important for everyone to continue using all the tools available to help stop this pandemic as we learn more about how COVID-19 vaccines work in real-world conditions. Cover your mouth and nose with a mask when around others, stay at least 6 feet away from others, avoid crowds, and wash your hands often.
