A key approach to defending yourself and your family is to be proactive in supporting the body's own natural defenses by building strong immune systems, so you can get out in front of infections. Preventative plant medicine can help boost your body's ability to naturally fight off illness. Read on to learn how [Deep Immune](https://stfrancisherbfarm.com/products/deep-immune) is a vital aid in staying healthy. Immunity 101 Our immune system is a complex network of tissue and cells found all throughout the body - divided into two categories: innate (proactive) and adaptive (reactive) immune responses. - We're born with innate immunity that acts as a first line of immune defense. It performs an immediate general response to perceived threats and defends the body in most cases. - Our adaptive or selective immunity is developed through life. It involves specialized immune cells and antibodies created through previous exposures that react to specific invaders. Herbs offer powerful support in fortifying these crucial immune responses against illness and infection - and adaptogenic herbs are particularly beneficial for proactively strengthening your innate immunity. The Adaptogen - Immunity Connection A balanced immune system is your strongest immune system; if it is overactive, there can be excess inflammation and strong reactions (eg. to some allergens), while if it is underactive, one is vulnerable to infections. What makes adaptogens so effective in immune support is their ability to increase the body's general resistance to threats by adapting their function to what the body needs for its systems to regulate back to its balanced, strongest state. Adaptogens are unique therapeutic plants backed by both centuries of traditional use and modern research and are the foundation of the #1 selling [Deep Immune](https://stfrancisherbfarm.com/product/deep-immune) daily formula. These are some of the adaptogens found in Deep Immune: [Reishi](https://stfrancisherbfarm.com/product/reishi?_pos=1&_sid=9ff8e0a4b&_ss=r)- a highly valued mushroom in Traditional Chinese Medicine that lowers the effects of stress and modulates immune system responses.
