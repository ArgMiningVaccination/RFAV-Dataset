As our hormone levels fluctuate, we experience symptoms such as mood swings, hot flashes, weight gain, and difficulty sleeping. These can be frustrating and affect our quality of life, but there's a solution: seeing a [naturopathic women's health](https://summerhillnaturopathic.com/womens-health/) specialist. Naturopaths specialize in natural hormone balancing, utilizing herbs, nutrition, and lifestyle modifications to help us maintain balance. Understanding Hormonal Imbalance Hormonal imbalances occur when we either have too much or too little of a particular hormone. The most common hormonal imbalances that occur as we age are estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone. These imbalances typically occur during menopause, andropause for men, or anytime when our hormones are fluctuating. Common symptoms of hormonal imbalances include hot flashes, weight gain, acne, PMS or PMDD, mood swings, and reduced sex drive. Benefits of Natural Hormone Balancing Naturopaths promise a holistic approach to treating hormonal imbalances using natural remedies such as herbs, supplements, diet and lifestyle changes. This approach aims to get to the underlying cause of the hormonal imbalance and improve overall health and wellness. Unlike conventional hormone treatments, natural remedies have no harmful side effects and are beneficial for overall well-being. Naturopathy focuses on long-term treatment rather than instant gratification, thus leading to much more effective results. Best Natural Treatments for Hormonal Imbalance Natural treatments for hormonal imbalance vary depending on the specific hormone that's out of balance. For instance, natural treatments for low testosterone levels include ashwagandha, magnesium, and zinc supplementation. For high estrogen levels, a naturopath may recommend cruciferous vegetables, flaxseeds, or probiotic supplements. In women, bioidentical hormone replacement therapy may be suggested, where hormones are made to exactly match the hormones in a woman's body. Healthy Lifestyle Tips for Natural Hormone Balance Diet and lifestyle changes are another natural approach to balancing hormones. A naturopath can work with you to optimize your diet, control stress, and exercise regularly to improve balance for a healthy lifestyle. Getting sufficient sleep, limiting caffeine and alcohol intake, consuming whole, natural foods, and regular exercise can significantly boost your hormone balance and improve overall health. Consultation and Treatment If you're unsure of whether you have a hormonal imbalance or any other health issue, you can always book a consultation with a naturopath. Once you've been diagnosed, your naturopath will suggest natural remedies personalized for your needs and create a plan that's tailored to your specific lifestyle. This plan can improve your symptoms and balance your hormones. A naturopath can help you balance your hormones as you age through natural remedies that have no harmful side effects. Rather than opting for conventional hormone replacement therapy treatments, natural remedies aim at treating the underlying cause of your hormonal imbalance. Diet, lifestyle modifications, and the right natural supplements are all essential for hormone balance. Take charge of your health, and make an appointment with a naturopath today to maintain healthy hormone levels as you age.
