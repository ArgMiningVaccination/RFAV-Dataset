Production and filling of Sinopharm/BIBP COVID-19 vaccine in the UAE, renamed \"Hayat-Vax\" for local distribution [ [Arabian Business, 2021](https://www.arabianbusiness.com/healthcare/460987-china-picks-uae-as-regional-production-hub-for-sinopharm-vaccine) ]. General characteristics Sinopharm/BIBP COVID-19 vaccine is an inactivated vaccine that consists of virus particles that have been grown in culture and then were inactivated to lose disease-producing capacity, while still stimulating an immune response. Three SARS-CoV-2 strains were isolated from the bronchoalveolar lavage samples or throat swabs of hospitalized patients from a COVID-19 outbreak to develop preclinical in vitro neutralization and challenge models for an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate. The three strains HBO2 strain showed optimal replication and generated the highest virus yields in Vero cells among the three viral strains. Therefore the HB02 strain was selected for the development of the inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (BBIBP-CorV) [ [Wang H., 2020](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.06.008) ]. Ingredients The vaccine contains the following ingredients: Active ingredient 6.5 U of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 antigen Adjuvant 0.225 mg of aluminum hydroxide Excipients 1.4 mg disodium hydrogen phosphate 0.1373 mg sodium dihydrogen phosphate 4.25 mg sodium chloride Risk considerations Inactivated vaccines have been successfully employed for more than 60 years. These vaccines are made from highly purified viruses that have been made noninfectious. Such vaccines have been found to be safe and effective for the prevention of diseases caused by viruses like influenza and poliovirus [ [Gao Q, 2020](https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.abc1932) ]. Inactivated vaccines require the use of adjuvants which may cause undesirable reactions in vaccinated individuals [ [Wang H., 2020](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.06.008) ]. Previous experiences with the development of vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV had raised concerns about pulmonary immunopathology, probably caused by a response from type 2 (Th2) helper T cells. Although the cellular response can be elicited by many vaccines, protection against subsequent coronavirus infections is largely mediated for humoral immunity. The 'cytokine storm' induced by excess T cells has been shown to accentuate the pathogenesis of COVID-19 [ [Qiang Gao, 2020](https://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.17.046375) ]. Dosing and schedule The Sinopharm/BIBP COVID-19 vaccine is administered as a series of two doses (0.5 mL each) with an interval of 3 weeks between the two doses according to the manufacturer's product label. WHO recommends an interval of 3-4 weeks [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE-recommendation-BIBP) ]. The pharmaceutical form is a suspension for injection provided in a multidose vial of 2, 8, or 10 doses (0.5 mL per dose). The preferred site of injection is the deltoid muscle of the upper arm. If administration of the second dose is inadvertently delayed beyond 4 weeks, it should be given as soon as possible. Booster dose [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE-recommendation-BIBP) ] A booster dose is recommended for the highest and high priority-use groups (i.e. older adults, health workers, persons with comorbidities), administered 4-6 months after completion of the primary series. Once high booster dose coverage has been achieved in the highest priority-use group, countries may also consider a booster for other lower priority-use groups. If more than 6 months have elapsed since completion of the primary series, a booster dose should be given at the earliest opportunity. Heterologous schedule [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE-recommendation-BIBP) ] Evidence suggests that immunogenicity and vaccine effectiveness are superior with a heterologous booster (COVID-19 vaccine from a different platform) following a primary series with Sinopharm/BIBP COVID-19 vaccine, compared to a homologous booster dose. Any of the EUL COVID-19 vaccines can be used as a booster dose following a primary series of the Sinopharm/BIBP vaccine, preferably an mRNA-based or viral vector vaccine. Vaccination schedule for immunocompromised persons [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE-recommendation-BIBP) ] WHO recommends and extended primary series including an additional (third) dose for immunocompromised persons aged 18 years and older, administered 1-3 months after the second dose in the standard primary series. The most appropriate timing for the additional dose may vary depending on the epidemiological setting and the extent and timing of immune suppressive therapy and should be discussed with the treating physician. A heterologous additional (third) dose should be considered. A booster (fourth) dose administered 3-6 months after the additional (third) dose should be considered for immunocompromised persons. Indications and contraindications Indications The Sinopharm/BIBP COVID-19 vaccine is indicated for individuals 18 years of age and over [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE-recommendation-BIBP) ]. Contraindications The Sinopharm/BIBP COVID-19 vaccine is contraindicated in individuals with a known history of a severe allergic reaction to any component of the vaccine [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE-recommendation-BIBP) ]. (See the list of ingredients under 'General characteristics' in the extended version). The second dose of the vaccine should NOT BE GIVEN to those who have experienced anaphylaxis to the first dose. Precautions Allergic reactions [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE-recommendation-BIBP) ]. Persons with a history of anaphylaxis to any other vaccine or injectable therapy should be observed in health care settings where anaphylaxis can be immediately treated. As for all COVID-19 vaccines, there should be an observation period of 15 minutes after vaccination. Pregnancy [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE-recommendation-BIBP) ] Available data from clinical trials are still insufficient to assess vaccine safety or efficacy of the Sinopharm/BIBP COVID-19 vaccine in pregnancy. WHO recommends the use of the Sinopharm/BIBP vaccines in pregnant women when the benefits of vaccination to the pregnant woman outweigh the potential risks. To help pregnant women make this assessment, they should be provided with information about the risks of COVID-19 in pregnancy, the likely benefits of vaccination, and the current limitations of safety data. WHO does not recommend pregnancy testing prior to vaccination. WHO does not recommend delaying pregnancy or terminating pregnancy because of vaccination. Breastfeeding [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE-recommendation-BIBP) ]. WHO recommends using the Sinopharm/BIBP COVID-19 vaccine in breastfeeding as in non-breastfeeding women. This is based on the following considerations: (a) Vaccine effectiveness is expected to be similar in breastfeeding women as in other adults, and (b) The Sinopharm/BIBP COVID-19 is not a live virus vaccine, and it is biologically and clinically unlikely to pose a risk to the breastfeeding child. WHO does not recommend discontinuing breastfeeding after vaccination. Children and adolescents [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE-recommendation-BIBP) ]. A phase 2 pediatric trial has been completed, but the Sinopharm/BIBP COVID-19 vaccine has not yet received the emergency listing authorization (EUL/WHO) for this age indication. Older persons [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE_recommendation-BNT162b2-2021.1) ]. Vaccination is recommended for older persons without an upper age limit Persons living with HIV [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE-recommendation-BIBP) ]. Data on the administration of the Sinopharm/BIBP COVID-19 vaccine are currently insufficient to allow the assessment of efficacy for persons living with HIV. Given that the vaccine is nonreplicating, persons living with HIV who are well controlled may be vaccinated with the standard primary series of two doses. Counseling should be provided to inform the individual benefit-risk assessment. Persons with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE-recommendation-BIBP) ]. Vaccination may be offered regardless of a person's history of symptomatic or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. The optimal time interval between a natural infection and vaccination is not yet known. An interval of 3 months could be considered. Persons with current acute COVID-19 [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE-recommendation-BIBP) ] Persons with acute PCR-confirmed COVID-19 should not be vaccinated until after they have recovered from acute illness and the criteria for discontinuation of isolation have been met. Persons who previously received passive antibody therapy for COVID-19[ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE_recommendation-BNT162b2-2021.1) ] Although some reduction in vaccine-induced antibody titers has been observed in this group, the balance of benefits versus risks favors vaccination. Other precautions As with other intramuscular injections, the vaccine should be given with caution in individuals with bleeding disorders or other conditions that increase the risk of bleeding, such as anticoagulant therapy, thrombocytopenia, and hemophilia [ [Ministerio de Salud Argentina, 2021](https://bancos.salud.gob.ar/sites/default/files/2021-03/manual-vacunador-sinopharm_12-3-2021.pdf) ]. Vaccination should be postponed in individuals with an acute febrile illness (body temperature over 38.5\u00baC) until they are afebrile [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE-recommendation-BIBP) ]. Co-administration with other vaccines [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE-recommendation-BIBP) ] For adults, COVID-19 vaccines may be administered concomitantly or at any time before or after other adult vaccines, including: live attenuated vaccines, inactivated, adjuvanted, or non-adjuvanted vaccines. When administered concomitantly, the vaccines should be injected at separate sites, preferably different extremities. Storage and logistics Storage Sinopharm/BIBP COVID-19 vaccine is stored and transported as a refrigerated suspension between 2\u00b0 C to 8\u00b0 C (36\u00b0 F to 46\u00b0 F) [ [WHO, 2021](https://extranet.who.int/pqweb/vaccines/who-recommendation-covid-19-vaccine-bibp) ]. The shelf life of Sinopharm/BIBP COVID-19 vaccine of up to 24 months stored between 2\u00b0 C and 8\u00b0 C (36\u00b0 F to 46\u00b0 F) [ [WHO, 2021](https://extranet.who.int/pqweb/vaccines/who-recommendation-covid-19-vaccine-bibp) ]. Vials should not be frozen through any refrigeration method and they should be protected from light. Administration logistics Inspect the vial before use. Sinopharm/BIBP vaccine is an opalescent, injectable suspension with possible precipitate formation that must be resuspended by inverting the vial several times to mix. The vial should be discarded if particles or differences are observed in the described appearance of the vaccine. Do not shake the vial roughly. Storage after first puncture After taking the first dose from the multidose vial, the vial should be used within a maximum of 6 hours (stored at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C [36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F]) or discarded at the end of the immunization session, whichever comes first [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE-recommendation-BIBP) ]. The single-dose vial should be used immediately after opening. Record the date and time the vial should be discarded. To improve traceability, the name and batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded [ [WHO, 2021](https://extranet.who.int/pqweb/vaccines/who-recommendation-covid-19-vaccine-bibp) ]. Administration 1. Using aseptic technique, clean the vial stopper with a single-use antiseptic swab. 2. Use a 3 mL reuse prevention syringe (RUP) or a 5 mL RUP syringe, and a 21G or narrower needle. 3. Gently invert the vial to mix, and withdraw the 0.5 mL dose. If the amount of vaccine remaining in the vial cannot provide a full 0.5 mL dose, discard the vial and the remaining volume. 4. Administer the vaccine intramuscularly, preferably into the deltoid muscle. Do not administer the vaccine intravascularly, subcutaneously, or intradermally. Disposal Due to the high risk that discarded vials of COVID-19 vaccines may be recovered, it is essential that they are guaranteed to be safely disposed of at the site of use; or study the possibility of applying reverse logistics, if the safe treatment and disposal of vaccine residues cannot be guaranteed, so that they are transferred to the place established for that purpose. Otherwise, consider the possibility that the discarded vaccine vials are shredded, if there is a safe way to do so [ [WHO, 2021](https://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/339561) ]. Clinical studies - general characteristics The following randomized clinical trials have reported vaccine efficacy and/or safety data: Phase 1/2: The trial conducted by Xia S et al. (ChiCTR2000032459, [ [Henan Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020](http://www.chictr.org.cn/showprojen.aspx?proj=53003) ]) in China started in August 2020. In phase 1, 192 individuals aged 18 to 80 years, who had specific negative IgM/IgG antibodies in serum against SARS-CoV-2, were separated into two age groups (18 to 59 years and 60 years) and randomized to receive either vaccine or placebo in a two-dose schedule of 2 g, 4 g, or 8 g on days 0 and 28. In phase 2, healthy adults (aged 18 to 59 years) were randomized (1:1:1:1) to receive vaccine or placebo in a single-dose schedule of 8 g on day 0 or in a two-dose schedule of 4 g on days 0 and 14, 0 and 21, or 0 and 28 [ [Xia, Shengli, 2021](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30831-8) ]. For the children and adolescent subgroup, phase 1 included 288 participants; phase 2, 720 individuals who were stratified according to age (3-5, 6-12, or 13-17 years). All participants were randomized to receive three doses of 2 g, 4 g, or 8 g of vaccine or control (1:1:1:1) 28 days apart [ [Xia S, 2021](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(21)00462-X) ]. Phase 2: The trial conducted by Macchia et al. (NCT05027672 [ 2021](https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT04962906) ]) in Argentina started in July 2021. It included 540 participants with no history of COVID-19 infection who had received a first dose of the Sputnik V vaccine (rAd26 component) at least 30 days earlier. Participants were randomized 1:1:1:1:1 to receive a second dose of Sputnik rAd5 [ [Macchia A, 2022](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lana.2022.100196) ]. Phase 3: The trial conducted by Al Kaabi et al. (NCT04510207, [ [China National Biotec Group Company Limited, 2020](https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT04510207) ]) was designed in China and conducted in several countries. It included 40,382 participants aged 18 years or older with no history of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The participants were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive one of the two inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccines (Sinopharm/WIBP 5 ug/dose or Sinopharm/BIBP 4ug/dose) or aluminum hydroxide as a control group, administered 28 days apart [ [Al Kaabi N, 2021](https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jama.2021.8565) ]. Vaccine efficacy and effectiveness Efficacy of preclinical studies on the vaccine To assess the immunogenicity of the vaccine, BALB / c mice were injected with different vaccine schedules (2, 4 or 8 \u00b5g / dose). In the one-dose immunization group, mice were administered intraperitoneally with a high (8 g / dose), medium (4 g / dose), or low (2 g / dose) dose of vaccine on day 0, then, on days 7, 14, 21 and 28 post-inoculation, the levels of neutralizing antibodies were evaluated. The results showed that the seroconversion rate in the high, medium and low dose groups reached 100% at day 7 after immunization, and the effect of immunization was time-dependent [ [Wang H., 2020](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.06.008) ]. In the two-dose immunization group, two immunization programs were assessed at days 0/7, days 0/14, and days 0/21, respectively. The seropositivity of the high, medium and low-dose groups from all three immunization programs reached 100% at 7 days after the second immunization. The immunogenicity of a three-dose immunization program, in which the mice were intraperitoneally administered a high (8 g/dose), middle (4 g/dose), or low (2 g/dose) dose of vaccine at days 0, 7, and 14, showed that seroconversion rate in all three groups reached 100% at day 7 after the first immunization [ [Wang H., 2020](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.06.008) ]. Immunogenicity of the vaccine was tested in different animal models: rabbits, guinea pigs, rats, and mice. The animals were immunized with high (8 g/dose), middle (4 g/dose), or low (2 g/dose) doses of vaccine in the different immunization programs. The seroconversion rate reached 100% at 21 days after immunization in all animal models in all the immunization programs tested [ [Wang H., 2020](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.06.008) ]. Immunogenicity was also tested in primates. One group of macaques was selected to be immunized twice, on days 0 and 14, while another group received physiological saline intramuscularly to act as control. The experimental groups were injected intramuscularly with a low dose (2 \u00b5g / dose) or a high dose (8 \u00b5g / dose) of the vaccine. Subsequently, on day 24 (10 days after the second immunization), all macaques were challenged intratracheally with 106 TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2. Body temperature measurements were performed in both the vaccinated and placebo groups. The temperatures of both groups fluctuated within the normal range 7 days after the exposure to the virus. Furthermore, the biochemical parameters after vaccination remained constant [ [Wang H., 2020](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.06.008) ]. Efficacy of the vaccine in clinical trials Main immunogenicity outcomes Xia et al was a a dose-escalation, randomized trial. The trial included healthy people aged 18-80 years, who were negative for serum-specific IgM/IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. The sample size was 192. The mean age of the participants was 54 years and the proportion of females was 50%. Participants were randomly assigned to receive placebo or vaccine. In phase 1, on days 0 and 28, the intervention group received Sinopharm/BBIBP COVID-19 vaccine containing 2 \u00b5g, 4 \u00b5g, or 8 \u00b5g total protein, and the control group received placebo. Neutralizing antibody mean titres were higher at day 42 in the group aged 18-59 years: 87\u00b77 for the 2 \u00b5g group; and 228\u00b77 for the 8 \u00b5g group. In the elderly group of participants (>60 years), mean titres were 80\u00b77 in the 2 131\u00b75 in 4 \u00b5g group; and the 8 \u00b5g group [ [Xia, Shengli, 2021](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30831-8) ]. Key messages Sinopharm/BIBP COVID-19 vaccine reduces the risk of contracting COVID-19 Sinopharm/BIBP COVID-19 vaccine reduces the risk of contracting severe COVID-19 Main efficacy outcomes of Sinopharm/BIBP COVID-19 vaccine Contracting COVID-19 (at least 14 days following 2nd dose) The relative risk of contracting COVID-19 in the group that received Sinopharm/BIBP COVID-19 vaccine versus the group that received placebo vaccine was 0.27 (95% CI 0.18 to 0.4). This means Sinopharm/BIBP COVID-19 vaccine reduced the risk of contracting COVID-19 by 73%, compared with placebo vaccine. Figure - Forest plot of risk ratio meta-analysis. Outcome: contracting COVID-19. Comparison: Sinopharm/BIBP COVID-19 vaccine versus placebo vaccine In the trial identified in this review, 116 people not receiving Sinopharm/BIBP COVID-19 vaccine out of 12722 presented this outcome (9 per 1000) versus 31 out of 12713 in the group that did receive it (2 per 1000). In other words, 7 less people per 1000 did not develop the outcome because of the vaccine. This is the same as saying that the intervention led to an absolute risk reduction of 0.7%, or that the intervention reduced the risk of contracting COVID-19 by 0.7 percentage points. Another way of presenting the same information about the absolute effects is the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial/harmful outcome (NNTB/H), the number of participants who need to receive the intervention for one of them to experience the outcome. In this case, the NNTB is 143. Which means that 143 people need to receive the vaccine for one of them to not contract COVID-19. Applying the GRADE approach [ [The GRADE Working Group, 2013](https://gdt.gradepro.org/app/handbook/handbook.html) ], we assessed the certainty of the evidence for this outcome as high. Contracting severe COVID-19 (at least 14 days following 2nd dose) The relative risk of contracting severe COVID-19 in the group that received Sinopharm/BIBP COVID-19 vaccine versus the group that received placebo vaccine was 0.2 (95% CI 0.01 to 4.17). This means Sinopharm/BIBP COVID-19 vaccine reduce the risk of contracting severe COVID-19 by 80%, compared with placebo vaccine. Figure - Forest plot of risk ratio meta-analysis. Outcome: contracting severe COVID-19. Comparison: Sinopharm/BIBP COVID-19 vaccine versus placebo vaccine In the trial identified in this review, 2 people not receiving Sinopharm/BIBP COVID-19 vaccine out of 12737 presented this outcome (16 per 100000) versus 0 out of 12726 in the group that did receive it (3 per 100000). In other words, 13 less people per 100000 did not develop the outcome because of the vaccine. This is the same as saying that the intervention led to an absolute risk reduction of 0.013%, or that the intervention reduced the risk of contracting severe COVID-19 by 0.013 percentage points. Another way of presenting the same information about the absolute effects is the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial/harmful outcome (NNTB/H), the number of participants who need to receive the intervention for one of them to experience the outcome. In this case, the NNTB is 7692. Which means that 7692 people need to receive the vaccine for one of them to not contract severe COVID-19. Applying the GRADE approach [ [The GRADE Working Group, 2013](https://gdt.gradepro.org/app/handbook/handbook.html) ], we assessed the certainty of the evidence for this outcome as low. The certainty of the evidence is based in the following judgments: Risk of bias: no concerns; Inconsistency: no concerns; Indirectness: the information available is based on a short term follow-up; Imprecision: the information provides from a small sample; Publication bias: no concerns. Mortality The existing evidence does not allow to assess the impact of Sinopharm/BIBP COVID-19 vaccine on the risk of death attributable to COVID-19. The information provided by randomized trials was not adequately powered to estimate a difference in this outcome. Deaths can occur in the intervention and control group for reasons unrelated to COVID-19 or the vaccine. Establishing that there is a reduction (or increase) in the risk of death attributable to Moderna COVID-19 vaccine would require trials with a higher statistical power. Efficacy of the vaccine in subgroups Contracting COVID-19 (Female) (at least 14 days following 2nd dose) The relative risk of contracting covid-19 in women in the group that received Sinopharm/BIBP COVID-19 vaccine versus the group that received placebo vaccine was 0.24 (95% CI 0.07 to 0.86). This means Sinopharm/BIBP COVID-19 vaccine reduce the risk of contracting covid-19 in women by 76%, compared with placebo vaccine. Figure - Forest plot of risk ratio meta-analysis. Outcome: contracting covid-19 in women . Comparison: Sinopharm/BIBP COVID-19 vaccine versus placebo vaccine In the trial identified in this review, 12 people not receiving Sinopharm/BIBP COVID-19 vaccine out of 1932 presented this outcome (6 per 1000) versus 3 out of 1976 in the group that did receive it (1 per 1000). In other words, 5 less people per 1000 did not develop the outcome because of the vaccine. This is the same as saying that the intervention led to an absolute risk reduction of 0.5%, or that the intervention reduced the risk of contracting covid-19 in women by 0.5 percentage points. Another way of presenting the same information about the absolute effects is the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial/harmful outcome (NNTB/H), the number of participants who need to receive the intervention for one of them to experience the outcome. In this case, the NNTB is 200. Which means that 200 people need to receive the vaccine for one of them to not contract COVID-19. Applying the GRADE approach [ [The GRADE Working Group, 2013](https://gdt.gradepro.org/app/handbook/handbook.html) ], we assessed the certainty of the evidence for this outcome as low. The certainty of the evidence is based in the following judgments: Risk of bias: no concerns; Inconsistency: no concerns; Indirectness: the information available is based on a short term follow-up; Imprecision: the information provides from a small sample; Publication bias: no concerns. Contracting COVID-19 (Males) (at least 14 days following 2nd dose) The relative risk of contracting covid-19 in males in the group that received Sinopharm/BIBP COVID-19 vaccine versus the group that received placebo vaccine was 0.22 (95% CI 0.13 to 0.36). This means Sinopharm/BIBP COVID-19 vaccine reduce the risk of contracting covid-19 in males by 78%, compared with placebo vaccine. Figure - Forest plot of risk ratio meta-analysis. Outcome: contracting covid-19 in males. Comparison: Sinopharm/BIBP COVID-19 vaccine versus placebo vaccine In the trial identified in this review, 83 people not receiving Sinopharm/BIBP COVID-19 vaccine out of 10805 presented this outcome (8 per 1000) versus 18 out of 10706 in the group that did receive it (2 per 1000). In other words, 6 less people per 1000 did not develop the outcome because of the vaccine. This is the same as saying that the intervention led to an absolute risk reduction of 0.6%, or that the intervention reduced the risk of contracting covid-19 in males by 0.6 percentage points. Another way of presenting the same information about the absolute effects is the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial/harmful outcome (NNTB/H), the number of participants who need to receive the intervention for one of them to experience the outcome. In this case, the NNTB is 167. Which means that 167 people need to receive the vaccine for one of them to not contract COVID-19.

Neutralizing antibody titers at day 28 post the third dose (GMT: 439.8) were higher than those at month 3 after the first dose (GMT: 91.1), a 4.83-fold increase [ [Zhang Y, 2022](https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11684-021-0914-x) ]. Cheng et al was a comparative study conducted in China, The study recruited 353 participants who received a primary vaccination regimen consisting of two Sinopharm/BBIBP vaccines plus a booster dose of the same vaccine 7 months from the first dose. Vaccine elicited antibody levels were measured before and after the first, second and booster dose. Results found IgA levels remained low throughout the study. IgM, IgG and neutralizing antibodies reached a peak level after primary vaccination that slowly declined over time. The booster dose increased levels of IgM to post dose 1 levels. IgG levels increased by a factor of 21.4-30.0 (25.2-35.8) post booster dose. Neutralizing titers had a 4.5 fold increase after the booster vaccination, 32.94 (95% CI: 24.22-44.81), when compared to initial (95% CI: 5.98-7.72).

In this study, 20 rats were divided into two groups and intramuscularly injected with 3 doses (8 g/dose) of vaccine and physiological saline as the control. After inoculation, all rats were continuously observed for 14 days and euthanized at day 15 to assess systematic anatomy and for general observation. No cases of death or impending death or obvious clinical signs were observed in any of the groups over the 14 days after vaccine inoculation [ [Wang H., 2020](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.06.008) ]. Systemic anaphylaxis was subsequently evaluated by intramuscular and intravenous injections in guinea pigs. Thirty-six male guinea pigs were divided into 4 groups, 2 control groups and 2 intervention groups. The results showed no abnormal reactions during the inoculation and follow-up period, by clinical observation and measurement of the body weights of the guinea pigs. No allergic reaction symptoms were found in the negative control group or experimental group [ [Wang H., 2020](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.06.008) ].

Safety of the vaccine in clinical trials Main safety outcomes of Sinopharm/BIBP COVID-19 vaccine Any adverse event (at least 7 days after any injection) The relative risk of any adverse event in the group that received Sinopharm/BIBP COVID-19 vaccine versus the group that received placebo vaccine was 0.91 (95% CI 0.89 to 0.94). No statistically significant differences between groups were found for any adverse events. Figure - Forest plot of risk ratio meta-analysis. Outcome: any adverse event. Comparison: Sinopharm/BIBP COVID-19 vaccine versus placebo vaccine In the trial identified in this review, 6250 people not receiving Sinopharm/BIBP COVID-19 vaccine out of 6250 presented this outcome (465 per 1000) versus 5623 out of 13471 in the group that did receive it (418 per 1000). In other words, 47 less people per 1000 did not develop the outcome because of the vaccine. This is the same as saying that the intervention led to an absolute risk reduction of 4.7%, or that the intervention reduced the risk of any adverse event by 4.7 percentage points. Another way of presenting the same information about the absolute effects is the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial/harmful outcome (NNTB/H), the number of participants who need to receive the intervention for one of them to experience the outcome. In this case, the NNTB is 21. Which means that 21 people need to receive the vaccine for one of them to experienced any adverse event. Applying the GRADE approach [ [The GRADE Working Group, 2013](https://gdt.gradepro.org/app/handbook/handbook.html) ], we assessed the certainty of the evidence for this outcome as high. Local adverse event (at least 7 days after any injection) The relative risk of local adverse event in the group that received Sinopharm/BIBP COVID-19 vaccine versus the group that received placebo vaccine was 0.71 (95% CI 0.68 to 0.74). No statistically significant differences between groups were found for any adverse events. Figure - Forest plot of risk ratio meta-analysis. Outcome: local adverse event.

Applying the GRADE approach [ [The GRADE Working Group, 2013](https://gdt.gradepro.org/app/handbook/handbook.html) ], we assessed the certainty of the evidence for this outcome as high. Systemic adverse event (at least 7 days after any injection) The relative risk of systemic adverse event in the group that received Sinopharm/BIBP COVID-19 vaccine versus the group that received placebo vaccine was 1.02 (95% CI 0.98 to 1.06). This means Sinopharm/BIBP COVID-19 vaccine increase the risk of systemic adverse event by 2%, compared with placebo vaccine. Figure - Forest plot of risk ratio meta-analysis.

Summary of findings table (iSoF) Safety of the vaccine in subgroups Sex Randomized trials The safety profile of the Sinopharm/BBIBP vaccine against COVID-19 was not evaluated in all gender groups. Age Randomized trials For the vaccine recipients in the group aged 60 years and older (n=72), pain at the injection site was the most frequent adverse reaction (one [4%] in the 2 g group, four [17%] in the 4 g group, and four [17%] in the 8 g group), an additional injection site adverse reaction was induration (two [3%] of 72) [ [Xia, Shengli, 2021](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30831-8) ]. The most common systemic adverse reactions reported in the >60 age group (n = 72) were fever (one [1%]) and fatigue (one [1%]), reported in the 8 g cohort; and headache (one [1%]), diarrhea (one [1%]), and joint pain (one [1%]) reported in the 4 g cohort. All adverse reactions were mild or moderate in severity. No serious adverse event was reported within 28 days post vaccination for all cohorts [ [Xia, Shengli, 2021](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30831-8) ]. Children and adolescents Randomized trials No data are available for this subgroup Other comparative studies Thonginnetra et al. conducted a prospective cohort single center trial at Chulabhorn Hospital, Thailand, from 20th September to 11th November, 2021. A total of 36,808 adolescents between the ages of 10 and 17 were enrolled in the study. Participants were scheduled to receive two doses of BBIBP-CorV through intramuscular administration with a 21-28-day interval between doses. Among participants, 76% (27,880) reported reactogenicity within the first 24 hours and 7 days following the first dose. Half (51.41%) of participants experienced pain at the injection site; the majority of cases were mild in severity. Injection site tenderness (37.93%) was another common local reaction. Fatigue (37.89%), myalgia (33.56%), and headache (26.76%) were the most common systemic reactions. On days 2-7 after the first dose, 25.85% of participants experienced adverse reactions. Following the second dose, reactogenicity was 7.6% and 1.09% within 24 h and between days 2-7. The majority of reactions were of mild to moderate severity.

This study investigated the effect of female inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccination on cycle characteristics, laboratory parameters and pregnancy outcomes during in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment. Participants included women who underwent fresh IVF cycles between June 1st and September 13th 2021 and who were followed up to October 18th 2021. The number of oocytes retrieved (9.9 \u00b1 7.1 \u00b1 rate (33.5 \u00b1 29.8% vs 28.6%) and clinical pregnancy rate (59.1% vs 63.6%) were all similar between the vaccine group and the control group. Additionally, no significant differences were observed regarding other cycle characteristics, laboratory parameters and pregnancy outcomes such as: stimulation duration, total gonadotropin dose, serum sex hormone level, endometrial thickness, number of 14 mm follicles on trigger day, mature oocyte rate, fertilization rate, cleavage rate, blastocyst formation rate, available blastocyst rate, biochemical pregnancy (65.2% vs 73.7%) and implantation (45.4% vs 46.7%). Results were also similar when vaccinated patients were subdivided into three categories based on the time interval from complete vaccination to cycle initiation: 1 month, >1-2 months, and >2 months. The authors suggest that inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in females did not result in any measurable detrimental effects on IVF treatment. However, further prospective studies with larger cohort size and longer follow-up are needed to validate this conclusion.

A total of 409 health workers participated in the study to report adverse events of AstraZeneca (AZ), PfizerBioNTeck (PB), and SinoPharm (SP) vaccines. Approximately 18% of participants reported no adverse events after the first dose and second dose. No serious SE were reported. The most common adverse event from the Sinopharm vaccine was pain at the injection site [ [Abu-Hammad O., 2021](https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9060577) ]. Almufty HB, 2021 reported a cross sectional study conducted in Iraq. 1012 healthy adults were included in this study that reported side effects of Sinopharm, AstraZeneca-Oxford and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines. Results showed that younger participants (less than 50 years old) were most likely to have symptoms after vaccination; p value = 0.003. Additionally, female participants with history of COVID-19 infection and with comorbid diseases were statistically significant risk factors for having adverse reactions post-vaccination. Regarding severity of symptoms, only 139 out of 850 symptomatic participants faced severe to critical side effects and were related with the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine [ [Almufty HB, 2021](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dsx.2021.102207) ].

The most common side effects of the first dose were normal injection site pain, fatigue, and headache, while pain at the vaccination site, fatigue, lethargy, headache, and tenderness were the most frequent side effects of the post. 2nd dose in both groups. All side effects at both doses were more common among participants in the less than 49-year-old group. Post-vaccination side effects of the 1st and 2nd doses were mild and predictable, and there were no cases of hospitalization [ [Balsam Qubais, 2021](https://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.28.21258847) ]. Al Khames Aga QA et al. conducted a non-comparative study in Iraq and Jordan, which included 1,736 participants (vaccinated with Pfizer-Biotech, Sinopharm, Oxford-Astrazeneca). The Pfizer, AstraZeneca and Sinopharm vaccines were found to be safe and the Sinopharm vaccine showed a lower prevalence of adverse effects compared to the other vaccines. The duration and severity of adverse effects were not affected by age or gender. Unusual side effects should be closely monitored to determine if they are related to immunization [ [Al Khames Aga QA, 2021](https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jmv.27214) ].

The study enrolled 334 healthcare workers who had contracted COVID-19 of different intensities and were vaccinated with different types of 12.9%, Sinopharm 16.2%, Sputnik 62.3%,Bharat Covaxin 6.9%) at least month following recovery from the virus, between April 2021 and September 2021. The study assessed the incidence of headache following injection, showing that 39.2% of participants reported post-vaccination headache, with highest rates reported for AstraZeneca, followed by Sputnik V [ [Nasergivehchi S, 2022](https://dx.doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1323286/v1) ]. Houshmand B et al. was a cross-sectional study conducted in Iran. The study included 1,205 respondents of a multicenter electronic questionnaire via an online platform over a 1-week period among vaccinated dental staff and dental students inquiring whether they experienced vaccine-related side-effects after vaccine administration. The majority of respondents received AstraZeneca (51.1%) and Sputnik (37.6%). The symptoms most frequently reported after vaccination were fatigue (79%), local pain in the injection site (77.4%), malaise (73%), and body pain (71.1%). Enrollees reported more onset of reactions on 0-12 h (44.1%) and 12-24 h (29.0%) after vaccine administration .[ [Houshmand B, 2022](https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40902-021-00330-6) ] Monitoring WHO indicates that after a vaccine is approved for use, regulators conduct robust monitoring of efficacy, as well as monitoring of safety and risk minimization (pharmacovigilance) activities. They need to continually monitor the safety of the vaccine to ensure that the benefits of the vaccine continue to outweigh the risks. [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/news/item/17-05-2022-statement-for-healthcare-professionals-how-covid-19-vaccines-are-regulated-for-safety-and-effectiveness) ] Regarding safety surveillance and monitoring, serious adverse events, anaphylaxis and other severe allergic reactions, Bell's palsy, cases of multisystem inflammatory syndrome, cases of COVID-19 after vaccination resulting in hospitalization or death should be identified and recorded. Regarding the effectiveness of the vaccine, the following should be monitored: Efficacy of the vaccine over time and whether protection can be prolonged with booster doses. Studies to investigate whether this vaccine reduces the transmission and viral spread of SARS-CoV-2. Evaluation and notification of vaccine failures and information on viral sequences. Regarding the subgroups of interest Prospective studies on the safety of the COVID-19 vaccine in pregnant and lactating females. Occasional controlled trials on the safety and security of vaccination in children under 18 years of age. Safety data from vaccination in immunosuppressed people, including patients living with HIV and autoimmune diseases.
