This holistic view of the human being is becoming increasingly important in medical practice. In anthroposophical medicine, the sick individual has always been perceived and treated as an entire personality. Furthermore, the aim of anthroposophical doctors and therapists is to give the patient as much opportunity as possible to overcome the disease on their own, which gives the patient increased strength over the long term. As part of its Health and Nursing Care funding programme, the MAHLE FOUNDATION supports anthroposophic nursing, therapy and medicine. Anthroposophic medicine as an extended form of orthodox medicine More and more people want additional, holistic treatment methods in the event of a disease. This also includes the therapies and treatments of anthroposophical medicine. Anthroposophical medicine is often declared as alternative medicine - wrongly! Because it is by no means an alternative to conventional medicine, but instead a conscious addition and extension to it. Anthroposophical doctors have all completed medical studies and are licensed. As specialists, they master the entire spectrum of diagnostic and therapeutic possibilities of guideline-oriented medicine. Moreover, they have completed further training and education in the perceptions and healing methods of Anthroposophic Medicine, which was founded almost 100 years ago by Rudolf Steiner and Dr. Ita Wegman. The fundamental principles of Anthroposophic Medicine are medical professionalism, as well as the appreciation of and a sense of responsibility towards the patient in his or her \"special situation\" of being ill. Anthroposophical doctors therefore do not focus solely on the diseased organ or the disturbed biochemical interactions, but consider the patient individually with his personality, his biography, his life circumstances and his needs. To treat integratively means to awaken and strengthen the healing potential that every person has. Complementary therapies can strengthen the body's own self-healing powers, so that the sufferer himself can actively contribute to his recovery, and go his own way through the disease. Anthroposophic obstetrics and accompanying the terminally ill Anthroposophic obstetrics is also becoming increasingly popular due to its well-known \"gentle approach\" and the respectful treatment of the mother and child, which also takes into account emotional changes during pregnancy - an aspect to which little attention is otherwise normally paid. In this approach, the women are taken seriously with their experiences, fears and wishes. An attempt is made to strengthen their personal responsibility and self-determination in dealing with the pregnancy, birth and their new life situation. Anthroposophical obstetrics is a low-intervention obstetrics that - if possible - strives for a natural course of childbirth. Far too often, a caesarean section is performed in Germany for multiple pregnancies or pelvic end positions, although it is not necessary from a medical point of view. In anthroposophical maternity wards, cesarean section rates are very low. In addition, great importance is attached to parent-child bonding and breastfeeding after birth. Furthermore, Anthroposophic Medicine has proved to be an excellent aid in the care and support of the terminally ill. Through its sensitive and spiritually open approach to life on the verge of death, it allows the dying person to take a dignified farewell by creating an environment that supports them and their family on their chosen path. In addition to the physical care, the design of the surroundings is also important in anthroposophic end-of-life care. Attention is paid to the light, the room temperature and the odours, and it is ensured that the patient has enough space and does not feel cramped. Examples of support from the MAHLE FOUNDATION in the field of health and nursing care The Filder Clinic - the main support project of the MAHLE FOUNDATION A major concern of the MAHLE FOUNDATION is the establishment and further development of Anthroposophic Medicine in Germany and abroad, and in particular the training and education of anthroposophic doctors and nursing staff. The main funding project in this field is the Filder Clinic in Filderstadt-Bonlanden, which was established in 1975 at the initiative of the founders of the Foundation Hermann and Dr. Ernst Mahle. This is one of Germany's three large anthroposophic acute care hospitals whose function is to provide primary care. As not only a shareholder, but also the largest sponsor, the MAHLE FOUNDATION played a decisive role in supporting the construction of the clinic and is permanently committed to its expansion and modernisation. Furthermore, the facilities of the Filder Clinic are provided with additional funds for research projects and the training of doctors and nursing staff. The main points of focus of the clinic are gynaecology, obstetrics, internal medicine, surgery, paediatrics, oncology and, psychosomatics. In addition to standard forms of treatment, all of the departments at the Filder Clinic make use of complementary procedures. Besides physiotherapy or psycho-oncology, special anthroposophic therapies are also used, such as painting and music therapy or rhythmical massages. These are intended to promote the analysis by the patient of their own situation and their own life, and thereby support the patient's ability to overcome their illness and further their own personal development. Research, teaching and international projects in the field of health and nursing care In addition to the Filder Clinic, there are numerous other funding activities in the field of health and nursing care. In the summer semester of 2004, for example, the University of Witten/Herdecke - supported by the MAHLE FOUNDATION - started the \"Integrated Course of Additional Studies in Anthroposophic Medicine\" as Germany's first systemic university education of its kind. The aim of this is to overcome the dualism between orthodox and complementary medicine and include it as integrative medicine in the scientific discourse of teaching and research. The MAHLE FOUNDATION also has international commitments, especially at the sites of the MAHLE Group. Medical projects play a major role here. One example is Brazil: The work of the Foundation here is aimed at contributing towards the humanisation of medicine and therefore establishing Anthroposophic Medicine in the health system. This involves above all making this form of medical care available to all strata of the population. For example, the MAHLE FOUNDATION supports Casa Angela, among others, which is the first state-recognised birthing centre in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo. Here the mother and her child are able to experience a natural, gentle and dignified birth in a family-oriented, trustful and protected atmosphere - which is not a matter of course by Brazilian standards, especially for the poor strata of the population. It is often the case that women from these strata of the population give birth in locations which are unacceptable and dangerous for the mother and child, resulting in high levels of infant and maternal mortality.
