By the 1800's, separation of children from their families and tribal communities was legal practice across the US. By 1881, there were 68 AI/AN boarding schools throughout the United States, serving 3,888 students (McDiarmid, 1984). Federal prohi - bition against the practice of traditional American Indian ceremonies was implemented around 1883 and lasted until the 1978 American Indian Religious Freedom Act (Shear et al., 2011). During the Amer - ican Indian relocation period (1940s-1970s), the assimila - tion of Native people was of - ficial policy across the country (DeRosier, 1975). The Reloca - tion Act of 1956 provided fund - ing to send individual Native Americans and their families to relocation centers, locat - ed in urban areas like Denver, Chicago, Los Angeles, and San Francisco (CA Judicial Courts, n.d.). US-enforced relocation policies coupled with the Bu - reau of Indian Affairs failure to provide support and aid, resulted in centuries of dis - parities and inequities for our First Nations people. American Indian communities have consistently as - sociated their disproportionate rates of psychiatric distress with historical experiences of European colo - nization (Gone, 2013), widely referred to as intergen - erational trauma. Brave Heart and DeBruyn (1998) defined historical trauma as \"the cumulative and col - lective psychological and emotional injury sustained over a lifetime and across generations resulting from massive group trauma experiences.\" Duran (2006) refers to intergenerational trauma as \"soul wound\". There are 574 federally recognized AI/AN tribes, 324 reservations and over two hundred languages represented in the US. Approximately two-thirds of AI/AN live in urban, suburban or rural areas and one-third live on reservations. In 2010, Califor - nia represented 12 percent or 720,000 AI/AN citi - zens, alone or in combination with another race. The AI/AN population of the San Francisco Bay Area is very diverse, with 96,000 AI/AN represented across Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, San Francis - co, Santa Clara and San Mateo counties (US DHHS, 2010). \"Today, more than half of California's American In - dian population is composed of individuals (and now their descendants) who were relo - cated to large urban areas due to the federal government's termination policy\" (CA Judi - cial Courts, n.d.). \"The Ohlone are the predominant Indige - nous group of the Bay Area, including the Chochenyo and the Karkin in East Bay, the Ramaytush in San Francisco, the Yokuts in South Bay and Central Valley, and the Muwekma tribe through - out the region. Other Indigenous groups include the Graton Rancheria community (Coast Miwok and Southern Pomo), Kashaya, Patwin, and Mi - shewal Wappo in the North Bay, and the Bay Mi - wok in the East Bay\" (Bay Area Equity Atlas, n.d.). Native people continue to struggle with sustained health and socioeconomic inequities and die at sig - nificantly higher rates from tuberculosis, diabetes, unintentional injuries and alcohol related causes (six times more often than the national average). Accord - ing to Indian Health Services (IHS), \"the American Executive Summary 7Indian and Alaska Native people have long expe - rienced lower health status when compared with other Americans. Lower life expectancy and the dis - proportionate disease burden exist perhaps because of inadequate education, disproportionate poverty, discrimination in the delivery of health services, and cultural differences\" (Indian Health Services, 2009). Despite the many challenges, the American Indian community of the San Francisco Bay Area continues to exhibit an abundance of cultural strengths . Cul - tural connections and places to gather for celebra - tion and ceremony are especially important and val - ued. For Friendship House, this is made evident through the numerous intertribal cer - emonies, gatherings, and cel - ebrations that are provided annually and continue to in - crease over time with enthu - siastic participation from the American Indian community. For decades now, Friend - ship House Association of American Indians (Friendship House or FH) has addressed traditional healing methods as the foundation of healing and wellness for Native people and integrated these with best practices in trauma-informed services, substance abuse treat - ment, mental health services and community well - ness practices. FH residential treatment and youth and community services are guided by numerous evidence-based practices, many of which are com - plementary to the FH Healing Model. American In - dian healing practices, provided on a regular basis at FH include Talking Circles, Sweat Lodge ceremonies, Traditional Healer ceremonies, Gathering of Native Americans (GONA), Red Road to Recovery, Wiping of the Tears, Drum/Song Circles, and many others. Over the years, Friendship House has endeavored to integrate non-Native practices that are a good fit to Native practices, across all programs. Today, FH is guided by numerous evidence-based practices, many of which are complementary to the FH Healing Model. For example, Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) services assess the mental, physical and emotional needs of clients. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy focuses on emotional and mental issues and supportive therapy. 12-Step Treatment Model addresses the spiritual aspect of recovery and provides emotional support services. Together, these cover the four components (emo - tional, physical, mental and spiritual) of the Native Amer - ican Medicine Wheel. Case Management Care integrates a system of care, or community approach to cross-agency col - laboration, and is complemen - tary to the Gathering of Native Americans (GONA) approach which focuses on the guiding principles of Vision , Circles of Relationships and Sense of Hope (SAMHSA GONA Fact Sheet, 2016). To help build resilience and promote healthy development among AI/AN youth, healing practices are integrated with several evidence-based practices including: SBIRT, CBT, Case Management Care and Question, Persuade, Refer (QPR). Every year at Friendship House, 100+ unique tribes/ tribal bands are represented through the services of the Residential Substance Abuse Treatment, Youth, and Community Programs. Based on more than 25 years of measuring client/participant achievements, FH finds the best outcomes are noted when AI/AN culture and practices are honored and integrated into service delivery efforts. \"A ceremony can be a celebration of life that brings people, beliefs and sa - cred objects together, in prayer and song. It can be a purification, cleans - ing and healing ritual. It can be a way of detoxifying emotionally, physically, mentally and spiritually. A ceremony can be a sacred way of communicating with the spirits in an effort to promote healing and wellness\" (Waukazoo, et al., 2012).8Friendship House CDEP Study The Friendship House American Indian Traditional Treatment and Recovery Healing Model (FH Healing Model and Community Defined Evidence Practice (CDEP) is a prevention, intervention and treatment approach that aims to prevent and/or reduce substance abuse and its underlying social and mental health issues for American Indian/Alaska Natives (AI/AN) by decreasing substance abuse, depression, anxiety, criminal involvement and in - creasing cultural connections (engagement in tribal/intertribal healing and wellness practices) and productivity in the community (family reunification, job/education retention). The FH Community Defined Evidence Practice (CDEP) Study utilizes a non-experimental study design, measuring variables as they naturally occur through the programs and services of Friendship House. Treatment, recovery and healing from substance abuse are studied through the lens of traditional healing practices. In general, the evaluation focus of the Friendship House Comm unity Defined Evidence Practice (FH CDEP) is to examine the effectiveness of traditional healing methods on the substance abu se treatment population of American Indian adults who are residential clients at FH: Does the integratio n of American Indian healing practices into service delivery effo rts have a positive impact on program recipients' wellness (mental, spiritual, physical and emotion al), social and economic engagement, and cultural connectedness? The traditional healing methods for FH CDEP examination include the following ceremonies: Talking Circles, Tradition - al Healer, and Sweat Lodge Ceremonies. Cultural Gatherings that engage you th of the FH Youth Program and the AI/AN community were studied to a lesser degree. The FH CDEP examination includes two process questions, nine outc ome questions, and one formative evaluation question, as follows: Who are the clien t residents and youth and community participants of Friendship House CDEP? How many and ho w often did residents, youth participants and community members join i n each of the three program components: Talking Circles, Sweat Lodge and Tradition al Healer Cer - emonies? How many residents reported increased abstinence? How many resi dents reported improved mental health outcomes and how many client residents reported reduced distress (psychological, emotional)? How many residents reported decreased criminal involvement? How many residents were working or engaged in job/ed ucation training? How many residents reported decreased risky behavior (sexual a nd injection drug use)? How many residents reported improvements in positive l ife consequences? How many residents reported stable housing? How satisfied were re sidents with FH services and healing ceremonies? How many Friendship House residential c lients and youth participants indicated increased cultural connectedness as a r esult of their par - ticipation in the FH programs? Brief description of ceremonies implemented through Friendship House (Appendices, Table 2): Talking Circles are implemented twice a month for Residents of the FH Sub - stance Abuse Treatment Program who may participate in sessions lasting 1-2 hours each. From July 2018 through June 2021: 314 (unduplicated) residents participated in Talking Circles (84 sessions total). Sweat Lodge is a ceremonial way of prayer to connect spiritually and to detox the body from toxins such as drugs and alcohol. Sweat Lodge ceremonies are implemented twice a month for residents with sessions lasting314 159 263Residents participated in 84 Talking Circle Sessions Residents participated in 28 Sweat Lodge Ceremonies Residents participated in 20 Group and 98 Individual Traditional Healer SessionsCEREMONY TYPES & COUNTS 2018-2021 2,526 Participants joined in 58 FH Hosted/ Co-Hosted Gatherings 9up to 3 hours. From July 2018 through June 2021: 159 (unduplicated) residents participated in Sweat Lodge Cer - emony (28 sessions total). Traditional Healers are selected to lead group and individual ceremony services for interested residents across a 2-day period, every month. From July 2018 through June 2021: 263 (unduplicated) residents participated in 20 Traditional Healer \u2014Group sessions and 98 Individual Counseling sessions. Cultural Gatherings are provided seasonally and engage community members, youth participants and residents of the substance abuse treatment program. From July 2018 - June 2021: 2,526 individuals participated in 58 FH-hosted/ co-hosted gatherings and celebrations. Friendship House traditional practices experienced small to significant interruptions\u2014mostly due to Shelter in Place protocols, were well-attended and often requested throughout the three-year study period. FH CDEP and evidence-based practices, relevant especially to the COVID 19 Pandemic were implemented immediately, across all programs. Practices most used included Case Management Care, Telehealth, and FH ceremonies/gatherings. Findings Residential clients of the FH Residential Substance Abuse Treatment Program, examined annually over the three-year study period demonstrated positive outcomes for abstinence, risky behavior, crime-free behavior, health/behavioral/social consequences, employment/education and stability in housing. Residents also re- ported significant improvements in overall health and psychological/emotional well-being, showing reduced anxiety, depression, hallucinations and suicide attempts. For cultural co nnections, 86% of residents surveyed felt that their involvement with FH helped them to make a connection to the Americ an Indian Community. The examination of Friendship House efforts on AI youth participants (n=90) up to age 24, studied over a two- year study period noted continued interest, engagement and connection to American Indian culture amongst FHYP participants, as evidenced through their: 1) ongoing participation in American Indian activities related to culture, identity, history and arts; 2) ongoing ceremony participation, including participation alongside family members; and 3) ongoing engagement in traditional healing activities. T o support CBPR efforts , community members (n=202)were asked to identify activities they would like to participate in \u2014Number One Choice: Tradi - tional Native Activities (48%; and compared to 53%, 2012-2019, n=1603) ; and asked to identify the issues that affect our SF Bay Area AI/AN Community: Number One n= 1603). Conclusion Native-based ceremonial practices are valued and effective in influencing positive outcomes amongst FH pro - gram residents and participants, as demonstrated through process and outcomes evaluation findings. Still, there is no one approach or \"one size fits all\" in relationship to the selection of intertribal practices (or evi - dence-based practices). For example, FH residential satisfaction survey findings indicated that many residents did not favor Talking Circles as a program activity. In addition, \"Calling Back of the Spirit\" was removed as a regular ceremony activity, due to feedback from several residential clients that \"this ceremony was not a regular and/or allowable tribal practice\" for them. In general, more indigenous research is needed to understand the significance of AI/AN organizational learning and cultural practices and how these facilitate effective service de - livery and positive outcomes for AI/ANs across the lifespan, in everyday life and in times of trauma and/or chaos. 10Two percent of the U.S. population (6.9 million Americans) self-identify as having American Indian or Alaska Native (AI/AN) heritage, with .5% pro- jected growth (10.1 million or 2.5% of the U.S. population), based on 2060 projections. There are 574 federally recognized AI/AN tribes, 324 reser- vations and over two hundred languages repre- sented. About two-thirds of AI/AN live in urban, suburban or rural areas and about one-third live on reservations. California is home to the largest AI/ AN population in the country and represents about 12 percent of the total American Indian population, with over 75% living in urban and suburban envi- ronments (US Census, 2010). Of those, two-thirds reside in the San Francisco Bay Area. There are more than 96,000 AI/ANs in the six counties that comprise the San Francisco Bay Area (Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, San Francisco, Santa Clara and San Mateo). \"Today, more than half of California's AI/AN population is composed of individuals (and now their descendants) who Population of Focus and Community Need Health disparities and inequities for AI/ANs began with the 16th century arrival of Europeans and by the 1800's, separation of children from their families and tribal communities was legal practice across all states. By 1881, there were 68 AI/AN boarding schools throughout the United States, serving 3,888 students (McDiarmid, 1984). Federal prohibition against the practice of traditional AI/AN ceremo- nies was implemented around 1883 and lasted until the 1978 American Indian Religious Freedom Act. During the AI/AN relocation period (1940s-1970s), the assimilation of Native people was the official policy across all US states (DeRosier, 1975). The Relocation Act of 1956 provided funding to relo- cate individual Native Americans and their families to relocation centers, located in urban areas like Denver, Chicago, Los Angeles, and San Francisco (CA Judicial Courts, n.d.). Historical trauma, including state-enforced pol- icies of relocation and assimilation coupled with the Bureau of Indian Affairs failure to provide support and aid, resulted in centuries of dispari- ties and inequities for First Nations people of the United States. AI/AN communities have consis- tently associated their disproportionate rates of psychiatric distress with historical experiences of European colonization, widely referred to as histor- ical trauma or intergenerational trauma. \"Indeed, present day health disparities have deep roots higher disease prevalence even several generations after the original trauma occurred\" (Gone, 2013). Evans-Campbell (2008) defined the concept of historical trauma as \"a collective complex trauma inflicted on a group of people who share a specific group identity or affiliation. It is the legacy of nu - merous traumatic events a community experiences over generations and encompasses the psychologi- cal and responses to such events.\" 11were relocated to large urban areas due to the fed- eral government's termination policy\" (Urban Indian Health Commission, 2007). \"The Ohlone are the pre - dominant Indigenous group of the Bay Area, includ- ing the Chochenyo and the Karkin in East Bay, the Ramaytush in San Francisco, the Yokuts in South Bay and Central Valley, and the Muwekma tribe through- out the region. Other Indigenous groups include the Graton Rancheria community (Coast Miwok and Southern Pomo), Kashaya, Patwin, and Mishewal Wappo in the North Bay, and the Bay Miwok in the East Bay\" (Bay Area Equity Atlas, n.d.). When American Indian and Alaska Native people needed services, they usually had to seek assistance from non-Indian organizations that did not nearly understand their needs, thus contributing to the disparities that persist today. AI/ANs experience se- rious psychological distress 1.5 times more than the general population. Mental health concerns include high prevalence of depression, substance use disor- ders, suicide, and anxiety - including PTSD, are experienced more than twice as often for AI/ANs when compared to the general population (Amer- ican Psychiatric Organization, 2017; WISQARS, 2020). From July 1, 2018 - June 30, 2021, 491 residential clients of the FH substance abuse treatment pro- gram reported information (at Intake) about vari- ous key issues that might impact their progress in the residential treatment program. For Substance Abuse/Mental Health Disorders (SUD/MHD), 10% of clients were diagnosed with Opioid Disorder. 8% were diagnosed with Alcohol Use Disorder. 48% were diagnosed with Mental Health Disorders and 18% of clients screened positive for co-occurring SU/MH Disorders. For Substance Abuse, clients' Health Concerns, 34% of clients reported chronic health problems and 12% of the client population screened positive for Hepatitis C (HCV). 1% of the population screened positive for HIV. 14% of residents were homeless. 29% engaged in unprotected sex. 53% felt \"constantly on guard\" to frightening expe For Crime/Criminal Justice: 7% of clients served jail/prison time in the past 30 days and 55% committed a crime in the past 30 days. 39% were on probation and 8% were awaiting trial (most com- mon charges: shoplifting, parole violation, drug possession, robbery). For Family History, 62% of residents reported having children. Of those, 12% reported their children as \"currently under protec- tive court order\" and 13% lost their parental rights. Educational attainment among AI/AN populations lags other groups. In comparing data for education rates of FH residential clients over the past two de- cades: Residents' high school graduation rate 12remained in the 30% \u201438% range, and the per- centage of clients who completed a senior year of college remained very low (1% to 5%) across the 20-year examination period (Lebron, 2020a). This is significantly lower than the high school graduation rate of single-race American Indian households in 2016, at 79.9% and graduation rate for the nation, at 87% (Urban Indian Health Com- mission, 2007). Poverty is a natural correlate of low education and financial stressors of day-to-day survival has a tremendous impact on the American Indian community. In the San Francisco Bay Area, one of the top ten most expensive housing markets in the world, AI/AN are at disproportionate econom- ic disadvantage. It is estimated that a family of four needs $91,785/year ($43,581 for an individual) to cover the bare necessities of living month to month (Gould et al., 2015). In comparing data for fulltime employment rates of FH residential clients over the past two decades: for residential clients working fulltime and tracked at intake, regular income remained significantly low across a 20-year examination period, under $2,500 monthly or less than $30,000 annually (Lebron, 2020a). Native people continue to struggle with sus- tained health and socioeconomic hardship and inequities. Yet, despite the many challenges, the American Indian community of the San Francis- co Bay Area exhibits an abundance of cultural strengths. Intertribal connections and places to gather for celebration and ceremony are especial- ly important and valued by the AI/AN community, and trusted leaders including traditional medicine people are integral to cultural strengths. For Friendship House, this is made evident through the numerous intertribal gatherings, ceremonies and celebrations that are provided annually and continue to increase over time with enthusiastic participation from the American Indian commu- nity. In FYs 2018-2021, 138+ unique tribes/tribal bands were represented through residents and consumers of Friendship House programs. Native Healing Practices \"There are many things to be shared with the Four Col - ors of humanity in our common destiny as one with our Mother the Earth. It is this sharing that must be con - sidered with great care by the Elders and the medicine people who carry the Sacred Trusts, so that no harm may come to people through ignorance and misuse of these powerful forces (Yellowtail, et al., 1980). While substance abuse is a treatable disease, many American Indians do not respond well to approaches that omit Native cultural values. Research has found that American Indian men and women who meet the criteria for depression, anxiety or substance abuse are significantly more likely to seek help from traditional/spiritual heal- ers than from specialty or other medical sources (Beals, et al., 2005). Help seeking through tradi- tional practices and traditional healers is common in AI/AN communities. To support implementa - tion of traditional healing methods, a FH Healing Model was developed under the guidance of indigenous researchers, traditional practitioners, and medicine people of Friendship House. Friendship House integrates American Indian healing practices with evidence-based methods to address the complex needs of residential clients. All aspects of the FH Healing Model are guided by the following American Indian traditional healing concepts: 1) Acknowledgment of tribal traditions and traditional ways is important in helping the 13individual to understand the uniqueness of their own tribal background and how this is tied to their Native identity. By developing connections with their proud American Indian heritage, clients strengthen their personal recovery process. 2) Participation in activities that honor AI/AN tribal and intertribal practices guides individuals in the direction of honoring/connecting with their own tribe as well as connecting them socially to inter- tribal communities. 3) Regular access to Traditional Healers and Practitioners is especially important in helping individuals understand, reclaim and cele- brate their cultural identity. Integration of Evidence-Based Practices In addition to AI/AN healing methods, adult ser- vices at Friendship House are guided by numerous evidence-based approaches, including: Screen- ing, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT)\u2014 effective in early identification of Sub - stance Use Disorder and Mental Health Disor- ders (SU/MHD); Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT)\u2014combines prescription medications with counseling/behavioral therapies to treat SU/MHD; Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Motivational Interviewing (MI), and 12-Step Model\u2014substance abuse treatment therapies; Case Management Model\u2014client-centered, collaborative approach for comprehensive care; and Telehealth Care\u2014used to provide access to services across a distance. To help build resilience, promote positive develop- ment and increase self-sufficiency among Native children, youth and young adults, evidence-based/ practice-based practices include: CBT suade, Refer (QPR); and FHYP Path to Wellness Suicide and Postvention (SPIP) Protocols (Lebron, et.al., 2021)\u2014to addresssuicide prevention/intervention/postvention needs. Community gatherings and ceremonies are provided to promote AI/AN well-being across the lifespan. Methods that promote cultural identity and pride in cultural self-esteem are supported by social identity theory which predicts that more favorable in-group attitudes should predict increas- es in self-esteem (Corenblum, 2004). In addition, many FH gatherings are based on the GONA ap - proach, focusing on the three principles of Vision, Vision, Circles of Relationships and Sense of Hope (SAMHSA GONA Fact Sheet, 2016). Community Based Participatory Research activities were adopted to ensure inclusion of stakeholders in CDEP implementation and evaluation efforts. Community engagement strategies included both online and onsite meetings to provide input to CDEP efforts. The Friendship House Traditional Resources Work Group (FH TRWG), for example, was established during the pilot phase of the CDEP Study. The TRWG met quarterly during the first year of the CDEP study and bi-annually in years 2 and 3 to review and help enhance the study's traditional components and local evaluation. To ensure resources and protocols were available and appropriate, post-ceremony surveys were complet- ed by traditional healers and support staff at the conclusion of regular ceremonies. Information was shared and modifications were made as needed through decisions at FH monthly grant meetings and quarterly quality assurance meetings. 14Friendship House Association of American Indians (FH) is a 501(c)(3), nonprofit, community-based or - ganization and was established in 1963 to serve American Indians who were relocated from their reservations to the San Francisco Bay Area. Since 1963, Friendship House has served more than 6,000 residents and hundreds of youth consumers and pro - vided community events for countless numbers of American Indians throughout the Bay Area. Ameri - can Indian tribal and intertribal practices are integral across all services of the residential substance abuse treatment programs, the youth and family program and the community services program. The mission of Friendship House is to meaningfully impact the lives of AI/AN by reducing trauma and inequities, increasing resil - ience to discrimination and substance abuse, and im - proving outcomes related to emotional, psychologi - cal, physical and spiritual well-being. San Francisco Bay Area counties are the predominant geographic areas served. However, FH outreach efforts extend beyond the Bay Area to include all of California and Western Region of the United States. The Friendship House Healing Model is a strength- based and trauma-informed community-defined evidence practice (CDEP), rooted in the philosophy that the individual must be working towards balance before she/he/they can sustain healthy behaviors over time. All aspects of the model are guided by principles and values of AI/AN culture, history, tra - dition and spirituality. Prayer, song and drum circle, sweat lodge ceremony, talking circles, counselingwith traditional medicine people and practitioners, community gatherings and many other tribal and in - tertribal efforts are integral to service delivery. Friendship House operates three program facilities: the FH Healing Center (includes an 80-bed adult primary and extended residential substance abuse treatment program and AI community center), locat - ed in San Francisco; the FH American Indian Lodge, a 9-bed residential treatment program for women and their children (prenatal to 5 years of age), located in Oakland; and the Friendship House Youth Program, a year-round youth program, located in San Francisco and two blocks from the FH Heal - ing Center. Friendship House Program Descriptions: Primary Residentia l Treat - ment (3-6 months): The FH Residential Substance Abuse Treatment Program is an 80- bed facility for American Indi - an adults, primarily. The FH American Indian Lodge is a 9-bed facility for women with their children (prena - tal to 5-years old). American Indian traditional heal - ing methods are integrated with program services and activities. The individual in recovery confronts mental, emotional, physical and spiritual issues and learns about the many factors that contribute to ad - diction. Extended Residential Treatment (6 months+): The Extended Residential Treatment Program is de- signed for clients who have successfully completed the primary residential component. Referrals/place - ment support for housing, education/employment are provided to help prepare residents for re-entry Introduction, Friendship House15into their respective communities. Goals for Resi- dents of the Extended Substance Abuse Treatment Program: Remain abstinent - no drugs or alcohol; continue daily practices of self-care, using the re- sources, skills and discipline learned through recov- ery and healing at FH; secure and maintain gainful employment or actively participate in education or vocation training; secure and maintain stable hous- ing; stay crime-free and actively engaged in clear- ing/correcting past records (if applicable); and stay socially and culturally connected in healthy ways to individuals, family and community. Friendship House Youth Program (Year-Round): The Friendship House Youth Program (FHYP) is a year-round program that provides culturally focused activities for children, youth, transition age youth and their families. Cultural identity is addressed through an array of activities such as regalia-mak- ing, dance and drum circles, Dancing Feathers Pow- wow, Family GONA, Boys with Braids Gathering, etc. Afterschool activities include academic support, social support, cultural identity and leadership de- velopment. Friendship House Community Program (Annual): Native events are hosted/co-hosted by Friendship House throughout the year, reaching hundreds of people from urban and rural areas from California and beyond. The Community Holiday Celebrations, \"Families in Recovery\" and the \"Gathering of Native Americans\" (GONA) are just a few events which provide a safe and supportive space for the com- munity to come together and celebrate American Indian culture and traditions. Cultural connections and places to gather for celebration and ceremony are especially important and valued by the AI/AN community, and trusted leaders including traditional medicine people are integral to tribal and intertribal practices. In general, continued interest, engagement and connection to American Indian culture amongst FH Residents, FH Youth Program participants and community members is evident through their ongoing participation in American Indian ceremo- nies, gatherings and activities; ongoing ceremony participation, including participation alongside family members; and ongoing engagement in traditional healing activities. Numerous evidence/ practice-based methods are implemented across the FH Residential Treatment Program and Youth Program and integrated into FH healing practices and ceremonies. Ensuring Quality Services Total Quality Management/Continuous Quality Im - provement (CDC, n.d.) activities included engage- ment of stakeholders, project sense-making (needs, effects, activities, context), evaluation design, gathering of information, monthly Grants Manage- ment Team meetings, quarterly Quality Assurance Committee meetings and annual evaluation of FH programs and services to regularly monitor per- formance and effectiveness. Based on more than 25 years of measuring participant achievements, Friendship House finds the best outcomes are noted when American Indian/Alaska Native culture and practices are honored and integrated into service delivery efforts. 16 141 residential clients were served in FY 2019/20, 134 residents at the American Indian Healing Center in San Francisco and 7 wom- en at the American Indian Lodge in Oakland. Admissions: The highest num- ber of admissions was noted for the months of January through March (n=50). The lowest number of ad - missions was noted for the months of March through May (n=17). Discharges: The highest num- ber of discharges was noted for the month of March (n=32) and influenced by COVID-19, Shelter in Place protocols.Residential Substance Abuse Treatment Cli - ents in FY 2019/20.141 81% 100 %of Residents from the Treatment Program were American Indians.of Residents with 7+ days received case man- agement services. Of 114 (81%) American Indian cli - ents served, 62% were affiliated with California tribes. For the top five tribes served, Yurok Tribe Hoopa Valley Reser - vation, CA led in tribal affiliation at 15%, by Navajo Tribe, and Cherokee Nation, OK, 5% . 91% of clients reported California as their state of resi- dence. Out-of-state clients were primarily from Nevada (3%) and (2%). 4% came from 100% of residents: with 3+ days of stay - screened ASI ASAM Criteria, PHQ- 9, GAD-7, IPV/PTSD Checklists with 7+ days of stay - participat- ed in case management meetings, weekly with 7+ days of stay - partici- pated in the development of their tailored treatment plan were referred to collaborative partners (IPV, Trauma, MAT, MH issues) if in need of further services were offered HIV and Hep B/C on-site testing at Intake (and 98% consented to testing) In Fiscal Year 2019/20, 141 Intakes were accepted into the FH Residential Substance Abuse Treatment Pro- gram (enrollment decreased by 36% when compared to recent years and mostly due to COVID 19 Shelter in Place protocols: 191 Intakes in Intakes in FY 2014/15). In addition to the COVID 19 Pandemic and Shelter in Place restrictions, primary reasons for non-entry to the residential program were cancellation or \"no show\", paperwork and/or medical clearance was not completed, financial problems and relapse. For American Indians living in urban environments, cultural connections and places to gather for celebration and ceremony are especially important and valued. In FY 2019/20: 134 residents participated in Talking Circles. 37 (unduplicated) residents participated in Individual Traditional Counseling. 116 residents participated in Group Traditional Counseling. 80 residents participated in Sweat Lodge Ceremony. Snapshot of Friendship House Residential Substance Abuse Treatment Pr ogram in FY 2019/20 17The FH Residential Substance Abuse Treatment Program is guided by numerous evidence/practice-based methods in FY 2020/21, including: Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT): In FY 2019/20, 98% of treated Buprenophine for Opioid Disorder. 7% were treated with Naltrexone for Opioid or Alcohol Use Disorder.

Friendship House Youth Program events and activities engaged 1104 youth, young adults, family and com- munity participants in FY 2019/20: 251 youth participants, 221 Transition Age Youth (TAY), and 632 Family and Community Participants. FHYP reached 647 individuals through outreach activities including drop-ins, flyer distribution, community potluck, Job Fairs, Unity Conference, Gathering of the Lodges, Annual Halloween/ Thanksgiving/Christmas Celebrations, etc. The COVID-19 Pandemic and Shelter in Place restrictions required immediate modifications in program service delivery for our American Indian population, in general. FHYP Staff adjusted program efforts to virtual plat - forms and coordinated efforts with other AI/AN-serving agencies to identify and respond to the needs of our program participants. Wellness Check-Ins were an effective program modification to respond to COVID-19 and Shelter in Place restrictions in culturally relevant ways. In FY 2019/20, ten FHYP and FH events and activities engaged 251 Youth, and 221 Transition Age Youth. From these:Snapshot of Friendship House Youth Program in FY 2019/20 30 families participated in family engagement activities including Talking Circles, Family Night, Wisdom Moving Forward, Powwow Dance Class, Sweat Cer- emony, Boys with Braids, Dancing Feathers Powwow, etc. FHYP and collaborators (NAHC, MeWater) provided Wellness Check-ins for 194 youth partici- pants & their families. Check-ins included drop-off of food boxes, water, school supplies, cleaning supplies, hand sanitizer and face masks; and regular phone/zoom calls/meetings, academic referrals and linkages to resources.

TOP 5 Issues that Affect our SF Bay Area American Indian Commu - nity: Number One Choice - Access to Health Care (74%), followed by Rac- ism (73%), Lack of Tribal Resources/ Services (70%), Domestic Violence (70%) and Community Violence (68)%. The American Indian community of the San Francisco Bay Area continues to exhibit an abundance of strengths - reflected through the numerous tribal and intertribal ceremonies, gatherings, events and activities that are available and attended every year. More than 75 tribes and tribal bands were represented through the Friendship House residential population, youth and family and community program participants in FY 2019/20. Ten FHYP and FH events and activities engaged a total of 632 community members, including family members of FHYP participants. Three annual celebrations, co-hosted by Friendship House and Native American Health Center (NAHC, SF/Oak - land) over the decades, include Thanksgiving Community Dinner (150 meals served) and the Christmas Commu- nity Celebration (200 meals served and 150 gifts/gift cards distributed to children, teens and elders in December 2019) and the Families in Recovery Celebration (120 meals served in July of 2019)held in beautiful Hoopa Valley.FY 2019/20, ten FHYP and FH events and activities engaged a total of 632 community members, including family members of FHYP participants.

For many years, Friendship House and the Native American Health Centers (NAHC) of San Francisco and Oakland have worked collabora - tively to increase the types of Native healing prac- tices that are provided in the San Francisco Bay Area. For example, in 2010, FH and NAHC joined efforts to initiate Traditional Healer services that are ongoing today \u2014 two days every month. From 2010-2012, FH established a Traditional Resources Work Group (TRWG), tasked with docu- menting the intertribal practices implemented at the Substance Abuse Treatment Program. The outcome of these efforts was the development of the FH Traditional Practices and Healing Model (FH Healing Model). In 2017, Friendship House received funds from CA Office of Health Equity (OHE) to further enhance the FH Healing Model, a Community Defined Evidence Practice (CDEP). In 2021, FH developed a Traditional Practitioner Mentorship Program and began to seek funding support for its implementation. The Friendship House American Indian Traditional Treatment and Recovery Healing Model (Wauka- zoo, et al., 2012) or Friendship House Model is a prevention, intervention and treatment model that aims to prevent and/or reduce substance abuse and its underlying social and mental health indi- cators for American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) adult residents of the FH treatment program. The curriculum's purpose is to facilitate client recovery and healing by providing the resources for them to explore their mental, emotional, physical and spiri- tual needs and values; and to gain insight into how these influence their personal healing as they walkthe Red Road Medicine Way. The workbook is used extensively during group sessions and emphasizes self-care, recovery, healing, and resiliency, and is designed to help clients reconnect with their cultur- al heritage as they work to attain sobriety, relapse prevention, healing and wellness. The Friendship House Traditional Treatment Healing Model in- cludes the following curriculum chapters: Friend- ship House Traditional Treatment and Recovery Healing Model; Traditional Red Road Medicine Way; Early Recovery\u2014Quest for Inner to Quest for Inner Balance; Sustaining Balance\u2014Walking the Red Road Medicine Way: Introduction to Sweat Lodge Ceremony; Introduction to Talking Circles; Healing the Child Within; and Introduction to Heal- ing Ceremonies. The FH Healing Model utilizes an Indigenous Framework, complementary to the Gathering ofPurpose, Friendship House Healing Model 21Traditional Healers provide group ceremonies and individual counseling sessions, two-days per month. These sessions are open to clients/ participants/staff/community members of FH. In addition, Traditional Practitioners lead FH Talking Circles and Sweat Lodge ceremony on a weekly basis (for Talking Circles) or bi-monthly basis (for Sweat Lodge ceremony). Other ceremonial prac - tices are provided on an as-needed basis. Cultural connections and places to gather for celebration and ceremony are especially import- ant and valued by the AI/AN community, and trusted leaders including traditional medicine people are integral to tribal and intertribal prac- tices. Throughout the delivery of Native services, apprenticeship, training and passing indigenous AI/AN knowledge forward to the next generation of American Indian healers has been an ongoing effort, embedded in ceremonial activities. Native Americans (GONA) approach which focus - es on the three guiding principles of Vision \u2014ac- knowledging the effects of historical trauma while geared towards \"whole person\" healing (physical/ emotional/mental/spiritual well-being), honoring cultural values and developing a vision of success; Circles of Relationships\u2014building quality and authentic relationships for effective work; and Sense of Hope\u2014focusing on interconnectedness, the sacredness of the inner spirit, balance, and the responsibility to be life-long learners (SAMHSA GONA Fact Sheet, 2016). The Friendship House Community Defined Evidence Practice (FH CDEP) is based on the FH Healing Mod- el, using best practices in trauma-informed services and substance abuse prevention and treatment and incorporating traditional indigenous methods such as Sweat Lodge ceremonies, Traditional Healer ceremonies, Talking Circles, Gathering of Native Americans (GONA), etc. For ceremonial activities, 22FH CDEP Description and Implementation Process The Friendship House Community Defined Evidence Practice (CDEP) is based on the FH Healing Model, using best practices in trauma informed services, substance abuse treatment and community wellness services; and incorporating traditional indigenous methods such as Sweat Lodge ceremonies, Traditional Healer ceremonies, Talking Circles, Gathering of Native Americans (GONA), and many others. In general, the FH CDEP is designed to address the following question: Does the integration of American Indian heal- ing practices into service delivery efforts have a positive impact on program recipients' wellness (mental, spiritual, physical and emotional), social/economic engagement and cultural connectedness? The FH CDEP Study utilizes a non-experimental study design, measuring variables as they naturally occur through the programs and services of Friendship House Association of American Indians, of San Francisco. Treatment and recovery from substance abuse are studied through the lens of traditional healing practic- es, specifically, Talking Circles, Traditional Healer Ceremony and Sweat Lodge Ceremony. Cultural gather - ings that engage the FH Youth Program and American Indian community are studied to a lesser degree. The FH CDEP is designed to address the following CRDP Phase I priority population strategy: adult and youth substance abuse prevention and early intervention services as a means to increase and promote youth and adult engagement and whole person wellness. The Friendship House Community Defined Evidence Practice (FH CDEP) focuses on FH \"Healing through Ceremony\" practices, specifically Talking Circles, Sweat Lodge, Traditional Healer and Cultural Gatherings, for the target population of American Indians. \"A ceremony can be a celebration of life that brings together people, beliefs and sacred objects, in prayer and song. It can be a purification, cleansing, and healing ritual. It can be a way of detoxifying emotionally, physically, mentally and spiritually. A ceremony can be a sacred way of communicating with the spirits in an effort to promote healing and wellness. It can facilitate the transformation from the old self to a rebirth of the new self. A ceremo- ny can be a means to show respect for creation, and honor for those who came before us\" (Waukazoo, et al., 2012). American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) adults of the FH residential substance abuse treatment programs are studied through the lens of traditional ceremonies. Cultural gatherings that engage the FH Youth Pro- gram participants and American Indian community are also studied to a lesser degree. Wellness is further defined by Friendship House as mental, physical, emotional and spiritual well-being. The FH CDEP includes the data collection and management of several tools, including: CSAT GPRA Tool (completed at baseline and 6-month follow-up), FH Post-Ceremony Survey, FH Resident Satisfaction Sur- vey, FH Community Needs and Interests Survey, Cultural Connectivity Scale and the Alcohol and Drug Use Survey.23 FH CDEP Ceremonies (Appendices, Table 2): Talking Circles ceremony is based on the principle of sharing power with one another. Listening and talking are both essential elements of Talking Circles towards facilitation of more in-depth and meaningful discussions. \"Only the person who is holding the feather or stick will talk. The eagle feather or talking stick gives to the individual, the courage and wisdom to speak truthfully and wisely. The speaker should not forget that he or she carries within himself or herself a sacred spark of the Great Spirit, and therefore is also sacred\" (Waukazoo, et al., 2012). Talking Circles are implemented twice a month at Friendship House for Residents of the FH Substance Abuse Treatment Program who may participate in sessions lasting 1-2 hours each. Talking Circle Participant Counts, July 1, 2018 - June 30, 2021: 314 resident participants (unduplicated Count) across 84 TC sessions. Sweat Lodge ceremony has been an essential part of many Indians tribes of North, Central and South America for thousands of years. \"The Sweat Lodge Ceremony is a spiritual healing ritual that medicine people use to heal and cure many illnesses. The ceremony represents the womb of the mother and is considered a place of worship, healing and celebration. One enters the Sweat Lodge to cleanse and purify\" (Waukazoo, et al., 2012). Through participation in this component, residents learn how to pray, sing, deepen communal bonds, develop trust, and express themselves emotionally. Residents also learn how to identify and let go of the habits, thought patterns and actions that have hindered them in the past. Sweat Lodge ceremonies are implemented twice a month at Friendship House for Residents with sessions lasting up to 3 hours. Eligible residents are those who have completed 30 days in the residential program. Sweat Lodge Participant Counts, July 1, 2018 - June 30, 2021: 159 residents (unduplicated count) participated across 28 Sweat Lodge ceremonies (discontinued 2/2020 to 4/2021 due to COVID-related restrictions) . Traditional Healers are c alled upon to lead and facilitate group and individual healing ceremonies. Like the GONA approach, the work of Traditional Practitioners is about healing and transformation and is carried out through mentorship formats that are congruent to Native ways of sharing traditional knowledge and teaching healing practices. Tradition- al Healers lead and facilitate group and individual ceremony services across a 2-day period, once every month at Friendship House for interested residents; and identify modifications and resources needed for future ceremonies. Resident Participant Counts, July 1, 2018 - June 30, 2021: 263 (unduplicated) residents, participated in 20 Traditional Healer Group sessions. 98 (unduplicated) residents participated in Individual Counseling sessions. Youth and Community Gatherings and cele- brations are provided seasonally and annually at Friendship House and throughout the San Francisco Bay Area and engage community members, youth participants and their families, and residents of the substance abuse treatment program. Community members are invited to participate in Traditional Healer and Sweat Lodge ceremonies, as space is available. Many FH gatherings are based on the GONA approach, f ocusing on the three principles of Vision, Circles of Relationships and Sense of Hope. Participant Counts, Youth and Community Gather - ings, July 1, 2018 - June 30, 2021: 2,526 community members participated in 58 FH and FHYP hosted/ co-hosted gatherings and ceremonies.24The FH CDEP Study provided an opportunity to study the programs and services of Friendship House through the lens of traditional healing practices. From July 1, 2018, through June 30, 2021, more than 136 American Indian tribes participated in Friendship House programs. Residential clients were self-refer- rals or referred from tribes, rancherias, Native Amer- ican Health Centers in the Bay Area and throughout the state of California, from criminal justice systems, homeless shelters and from Indian Health Services (IHS). Children youth, young adults and commu- nity members learned about FH services through \"word-of-mouth\", agency website and Facebook account and academic contacts. For CDEP-study outreach, potential participants were not singled out through separate outreach strategies. After enrollment into the residential program, residents were invited to participate in the FH CDEP Study. Those who accepted were fully informed, orient- ed to the study and signed participation consent forms. A Community Based Participatory Research (CBPR) was adopted to ensure the inclusion of stakeholders in project development - evaluation efforts. Stakeholder refers to residential clients, project staff and AI/AN members of the local Bay Area community who participate in and have the op- tion of providing feedback regarding the implemen- tation of FH ceremonies. Community engagement strategies included both online and onsite meetings to monitor performance and identify challenges and modifications. For example, to ensure resources and protocols were available and appropriate, post-cere- mony surveys were completed by traditional heal- ers and support staff at the conclusion of monthly ceremonies. Information was shared and modifi - cations were made as needed through decisions at FH monthly grant meetings and quarterly quality assurance meetings. Friendship House is committed to ensuring that its programs are culturally and linguistically appropriate for the AI community and engages National CLAS Standards as follows: 1) Governance, Leadership and Workforce: FH's Board of Directors represents the local AI community, cultures and experiences and its workforce is supported by \"Indian Preference in Hiring\" policies. 2) Communication and Language Assistance: The majority of FH staff are American Indian and English-speaking, primarily, with a few individuals who are bilingual in Navajo/Spanish lan- guages. 3) Engagement, Continuous Improvement and Accountability: FH program and service deci- sions are data-driven to ensure quality management and Friendship House publishes an annual evalua- tion report to assess the effectiveness of programs and services in an ongoing manner. San Francisco is seen as a safe-haven for lesbi- an, gay, bi-sexual, transgender, questioning and Two-Spirit (LGBTQ2S) individuals and draws people of all races and sexual orientations, including AI/AN CDEP Participation and Delivery Strategies 25were transgender.

Presenting Problems, Residential Clients A key factor in successful implementation of substance abuse treatment services is developing a well-informed continuum of coordinated care for individuals who present with high-risk behavior, unstable health and living conditions and exposure to trauma. All Friendship House clients are screened upon enrollment using ASI Lite, ASAM, PHQ-9, GAD-7, IPV and PTSD Checklists. From July 1, 2018 - June 30, 2021, 489 residential clients reported information about factors that may impact their progress in the treatment program. Information was collected at Intake. Key issues were examined and included: Substance Use, Mental Health, Co-Occuring Disorders, Health Concerns, Arrest History and Family History. 27 Tribe, SD; Enterprise Rancheria of Maidu Indian, CA; CA; Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe, NV; Shoshone Tribe Wind River Res, WY; Smith Ranch., CA; Turtle Moun - tain Band Chippewa, ND; Turtle CA; Cherokee Nation; Choctaw Na - tion, Valley Ind Val - ley, Mt; Santa Ynez Band Chumash Mission Indian, CA; Shoshone-Bannock Tribes Fort Hall Res, ID; San Carlos Apache Tribe, AZ; Picayune Ranch.

Description of local evaluation questions addressed through the FH CDEP tools: CSAT GPRA Questions The Government Performance and Results (GPRA) Core Client Outcome Measures uses client-level in - terview questions to measure and monitor substance use, criminal activity, mental and physical health, family and living conditions, education/employment status and social connectedness. For FH residential clients, the GPRA tool is administered at intake and six months after the client's date of entry to measure and monitor substance use, risky behavior, men- tal health (including psychological and emotional well-being), criminal activity, employment/education and stability in housing indicators (SAMHSA CSAT GPRA 2019). Substance Use Outcomes: GPRA Tool, Part B questions collect past 30-day information on the type and frequency of alcohol use, the type and frequency of drug use, route(s) of administration, and injection methods if injected drugs were used. Mental Health Outcomes: GPRA Tool, Part F questions collect past 30-day information on overall health, medical treatment, depression, anxiety, hallu- cinations, comprehension, memory, violent behavior, suicide, psychopharmacology information; and the client's rating of how much he or she has been both- ered by psychological or emotional problems during the past 30-days. Criminal Involvement: GPRA Tool, Part E questions collect information on past 30-day arrests, jail/prison time, past 30-day crime frequency, awaiting charges/ trial/sentencing and if the client is currently on pa- role/probation. Employment/Education: GPRA Tool, Part D questions collect past 30-day information on current enrollment in school/job training program informa- tion; highest level of education achieved; current employment; and income data (e.g., wages, public assistance, disability). Health, Behavioral, and Social Consequences: GPRA Tool, Part C questions collect past 30-day information on experiences of health, behavioral, and social consequences related to alcohol/drug use. Stability in Housing: GPRA Tool, Part C questions collect past 30-day information on where client has been living, level of satisfaction and stress related to living situation. Risky Behavior Outcomes: GPRA Tool, Part F questions collect past 30-day information on injec- tion drug use in the past 30 days, unprotected sexual contact, unprotected sexual contact with an injection drug using partner and unprotected sexual contact with a partner \"high on some substance\".29Resident Satisfaction Survey Questions To determine satisfaction with the FH Residential Sub- stance Abuse Treatment Program and other services provided by FH in FYs 2018-2021, residents were asked to complete satisfaction surveys at discharge from the program. Survey questions were organized by four categories: General experience, cultural experience, service experience and service satisfaction. General Experience: General experience is assessed through nine questions related to the client's personal experience with FH including the intake process, re- ferrals, engagement in the development of treatment plan, regular meetings with counselor, comfort with assigned counselor and feeling that their needs were understood. Cultural Competence: Cultural competence is assessed through nine questions related to the resi- dent's comfort with the program setting, perception that services received were a match to needs, cultural needs were understood, connection with the Ameri- can Indian community, etc. Service Experience: Service experience is assessed through eleven questions related to learning, valuing and applying new information, including service expe- rience related to traditional practices and activities. Service Satisfaction: General satisfaction is sur- veyed to understand the client's experience as a resi- dent and participant of the substance abuse treatment program. FHYP Participant Survey Questions To assess resilience and cultural connections, FHYP participants were asked to complete the Cultural Connectivity Scale (or subset of 6 CCS questions) and Alcohol and Prescription Drug Survey at program events in FY 2018 and FY 2019: Cultural Identity: Cultural identity is assessed through six questions related to the youth's con- nection to Native community or tribe, participation in cultural ceremonies, participation with family or someone close in ceremonies, plans to participate in future ceremonies, listening with respect to elders and having a traditional person to talk to when needed. Alcohol Use: Alcohol use is assessed through ques- tions related to lifetime use of alcohol and length of time, alcohol-free. Prescription Drugs: Misuse of prescription drugs is assessed through questions related to lifetime misuse of prescription drugs and length of time that is misuse free. Community Interests Survey Questions To support CBPR efforts, Friendship House conducts stakeholder surveys at community events throughout the year. Community survey collects information on demographics, where respondents go for medical services, about their current living situation, needs, interests and concerns. From list of nineteen choices, respondents were asked to identify the \"Issues that Affect our SF Bay Area American Indian Community.\" From a list of fifteen choices, respondents were asked to identify the \"Services and Activities They Would Like to Participate In\", in the coming year. FH Post Ceremony Survey To support CBPR efforts, post-ceremony surveys are completed by Traditional Healers and their support staff to answer the following questions: Did you have the resources that you needed? Were residents well-prepared for ceremony protocol? Were there any challenges, needs or barriers? What can we do to improve our efforts?30FH CDEP , Evaluation Questions In general, the evaluation focus is to examine the effectiveness of traditio nal healing methods on the resi - dential substance abuse treatment population of American Indians a dults: Does the integration of American Indian healing practices into service delivery efforts have a positive imp act on program recipients' wellness (mental, spiritual, physical, and emotional), social and economic engag ement and cultural connectedness? The traditional healing methods for FH CDEP examination include the following ceremonies: Talking Circles, Traditional Healer and Sweat Lodge Ceremonies. Cultural gatherings that engage youth of the FH Youth Program and the AI community were studied to a lesser degree. The FH CDEP examination includes two process evaluation questions, nine outcome evaluation questions, and one formative evaluation question, as follows: Process Evaluation Question #1: Who are the client residents and youth and community participants of Friendship House CDEP? Tracked: # of FH CDEP participants by demographics, and by presenting problems and by service needs. Tracking Tool: Accucare Electronic Health Records (Accucare EHR) and SAMHSA SPARS database systems are used by FH programs to collect demographics, and relevant assessment data.

For the purposes of evalu- ating ceremonial aspects of the Friendship House American Indian Traditional Treatment and Recovery Heal- ing Model (Friendship House Model) within the three years of CRDP implementation (2018-2021), this study examines the effectiveness of traditional healing methods used in the residential substance abuse treatment program for American Indian adults. Cultural gatherings that engage the Friendship House Youth Program participants and American Indian community are studied to a lesser degree, to assess interest and participa- tion in AI/AN traditional practices. Design The Friendship House Community Defined Evidence Practice is non-experimental, quantitative study design - measuring variables (ANOVA; pre/post comparison measures and rate of change; and means, standard deviation, degrees of freedom, p values, t-scores) for GPRA measure; and survey ratings for self-reported resident and youth cultural connected- ness, resident satisfaction and community needs and interests) as they naturally occur through the pro- grams and services of the organization. The FH CDEP focuses on FH \"Healing through Ceremony\" practices, specifically Talking Circles, Sweat Lodge, Traditional Healer and Cultural Gatherings, for the target popu- lation of American Indians. American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) adults of the FH residential substance abuse treatment programs are studied through the lens of traditional ceremonies. The CDEP evaluation measures changes in resident wellness (mental, spiritual, physical, and emotional) and measures resident, youth and community en- gagement (social and/or economic) and cultural con - nectedness? The level of intervention for residents - those who are \"at\" to \"high-risk\" or with early onset of mental illness, exhibited through substance abuse history. Measurement timelines for GPRA and Core Measures tools included Intake (within 2 days of resi- dential enrollment) and one 6-month interval. CDEP Study Instruments for resident completion included the following: PARC Core Measures, CDEP Informed Consent form, GPRA Client Outcomes Tool, and the FH Resident Satisfaction Survey (Resident completes at Discharge). CDEP Study instruments for FH youth participants included the Youth Drug/Alcohol Use Tool and Cultural Connectivity Scale (CCS). The CDEP Study instrument for community members was the FH Community Needs and Interests Survey. Youth and community surveys were completed at FH and FHYP events, gatherings, and celebrations. Friendship House Ceremony Descriptions: Talking Circle ceremony is based on the princi- ple of sharing power with one another. Listening and talking are both important elements of Talking Circle towards the facilitation of more in-depth and meaningful discussions. Before their participation, clients learn about the purpose, protocols and instruc- tions related to Talking Circle during the FH Traditional Ceremony Orientation. Following, they are eligible to participate in Talking Circle sessions facilitated by tradi- tional healers, traditional practitioners and counselors of Friendship House. Talking Circle is implemented twice a month for residents of the FH Substance Abuse Treatment Program who may participate in sessions lasting 1-2 hours each.33 Sweat Lodge ceremony has been an essential part of many Indians tribes of North, Central and South America for thousands of years and is a spiritual ritual that medicine people use to heal many illnesses. Through participation in this ceremony, clients learn how to pray, sing, deepen communal bonds, develop trust and express themselves emotionally. Clients also learn how to identify and let go of the habits, thought patterns and actions that have hindered them in the past. There is a separate lodge for men and women and transgender residents are encouraged to partici- pate with the group with whom they are most com- fortable. Before their participation, clients participate in an orientation meeting to learn about the purpose, protocols and instructions related to Sweat Lodge cere- mony. Sweat Lodge ceremony is implemented twice a month for residents with sessions lasting up to 3 hours. Eligible residents are those who have complet- ed 30 days in the residential program. Traditional Healers are called upon to lead and facil- itate group and individual healing ceremonies. Tradi- tional Healers lead and facilitate group and individual ceremony services across a 2-day period, once every month for interested residents and identify modifica - tions and resources needed for future ceremonies. All clients are invited to attend group sessions and to set up individual appointments. Through participation in this ceremony ate in prayer services. They also receive opportunities for individual counseling sessions with Traditional Healers. Youth and Community Gatherings and celebrations are provided seasonally and annually and engage community members, youth participants and their families, and residents of the substance abuse treat- ment program. Community members are invited to participate in Traditional Healer and Sweat Lodge ceremonies, as space is available. Many FH gather- ings are based on the GONA approach, f ocusing on the three principles of Vision, Circles of Relationships and Sense of Hope. Measurement Tools and Intervals At baseline, and six-months later, adult AI residential substance abuse treatment residents were measured, using the Core Measures and GPRA Instruments. Planned participant count, GPRA, Core Measures: 50 residents per six-month period over a three-year study period: 300 total residents to complete GPRA and Core Measures Instruments. All residents were asked to complete the Resident Satisfaction Sur- vey at Discharge. Youth participants were asked to complete the Cultural Connectedness Tool - CA version and the Alcohol and Prescription Drug Survey. Community members were asked to complete the FH Needs and Interests Survey. Community Based Participatory Research Throughout the three-year study period, CBPR strat- egies were implemented to ensure the inclusion of stakeholders. Stakeholder refers to residential clients, project staff and AI/AN members of the local Bay Area community who participate in and have the option of providing feedback regarding the implementation of FH ceremonies. Community engagement strat- egies included both written materials and online/ onsite meetings to monitor performance and identify challenges and modifications. The Friendship House Traditional Resources Work Group (FH-TRWG) was established to help select and monitor ceremony ac- tivities, and provide input to project activities, includ- ing evaluation.34To ensure a Community Based Participatory Research (CBPR) process throughout CDEP planning implementa- tion, and evaluation, a FH Traditional Resources Work Group (FH TRWG) was established during the pilot phase of the CDEP Study. TRWG members met quarterly during the pilot year of the CDEP study and biannually afterward to guide the study's traditional components, recruitment activities and local evaluation. For the purposes of evaluating ceremonial aspects of the Friendship House Model and CDEP over a three-year period (July 1, 2018 - June 30, 2021), project staff and the FH TRWG decided to recruit 300 study participants: American Indian adult residents, primarily, aged 18 and older, of any gender identity. The quantity of data for 300 residents over the three-year study was felt to be reasonable and minimal for study participation, based on treatment programs' average rate of 175 residents' annual enrollment in recent years, and based on the sam- pling methods of previous years' studies. To assess cultural connectedness, participation and interest in Native practices, cultural gatherings that en- gaged FHYP participants and the American Indian community were studied, to a lesser degree. The study used an alpha level of .01 for all statistical tests. Planned/Actual Participant Counts, Residential Clients Intake goals for Core Measures and GPRA Tool participant count were exceeded. 1) 300 planned/338 actual (unduplicated/unique) resident participants completed the PARC Core Measures instrument from July 1, 2018 - June 30, 2021. Intake goal exceeded by 9%. 2) 300 planned/489 actual (unduplicated/unique) resident partici- pants completed the GPRA Tool from July 1, 2018 - June 30, 2021. For 6-month follow-up of the Core Measures and GPRA Tool: 1) 138/338 CDEP participants completed the Core Measures instrument at the six-month follow-up interval, indicating a 41% follow-up rate. 2) 300/489 total FH Residents completed the GPRA Tool at the six-month follow-up interval, indicating a 61% follow-up rate over the three-year study period. Demographics, FH Residential Clients From July 1, 2018, through June 30, 2021 (Fiscal Years 2018-2021), FH adult participants of the residential sub- stance abuse treatment program included 491 residential clients. Of that total, 489 completed the GPRA Tool and 338 residents completed the PARC Core Measures Instrument. For Race: 76% of the 491 residents were American Indians. 7% were White, 4% were Multiracial, 3% were African American, and 10% were other Races including Asian, Native Hawaiian/ Pacific Islander. For gender of residents, 56% were male, 43% were female and 1% were transgender. For Ethnicity, 20% were Hispanic. For age range, 14% of residents were between the ages of 18 and 24, 36% were 25-34. 28% were 35-44, 17% were 45-54, and 5% were between the ages of 55 and 64. Of the 375 (76%) American Indian clients served, 62% were affiliated with California tribes. Sampling Methods and Size35 Recruitment to the FH CDEP Study was voluntary and a convenience sampling method was used for recruit - ment: American Indian adult residents, ages 18 and older were recruited based on availability at the time and consent to take part in the study. FH informed and requested participation of each newly enrolled resident at Intake. Measurement timelines included baseline (at Intake) and a six-month interval. Enrollment Goal: 100 (unduplicated/unique) resident participants to be enrolled in the FH CDEP annually (50 per 2 cycles annually) and 300 study participants over a 3-year period. All newly enrolled residents of the substance abuse treatment program were asked to voluntarily complete the Core Measures instrument during their screening interview. They were fully informed that their participa - tion was voluntary and had no influence on their residential experience. GPRA Tool completion was required for all residents at Intake and findings are integrated into local evaluation reporting. For study retention pur - poses, FH participants no longer receiving services at the 6-month interval were offered a $25 gift card for their participation in completion of the 6-month follow-up assessment tools (Core Measures, GPRA Measures). Data procedures included the following: Informed Consent: During their first session at FH, residents were engaged in an informed consent process, during which details of their participation in the CDEP Study was explained. During this initial session, the risks were explained and discussed with the resident. Staff informed residents that their participation in the study was voluntary; that they would continue to receive services regardless of whether or not they participated; and that they could skip any questions they did not wish to answer. Risks: In addition to fully informing residents that their participation was voluntary, they were also informed that they should not feel compelled to answer questions that may be personally distressful. Residents were informed of protocols in place at FH to protect their personal information. Safeguards: All resident-facing staff are trained on HIPAA Compliance, Agency Confidentiality. Protocols, and Privacy and Security Policies. Clinicians are sensitive to those who are coping with trauma as well as se - rious health and wellness issues. Data Storage: Data collection is managed through Accucare, an Electronic Health Records system; through SAMHSA SPARS, for GPRA data collection; and through Asset Panda database for ceremony activity/partici - pant counts. These three data systems facilitate intake documentation, data collection and analyses, client outcome reporting and ceremony participation counts/activities. Data protection protocols are compliant with all confidentiality, contractual obligations, state license and certification standards, CARF accreditation and HIPAA regulations to safeguard protected health information. Benefits: There were no financial or other direct benefits to participants. The FH CDEP Study may benefit the AI/AN community by adding to the knowledge base of indigenous ways of delivering services to Native people. Data Collection and Measures36Data Collection Instruments To ensure that CBPR interests were integrated throughout CDEP efforts, the FH TRWG helped identify critical data collection questions, and helped develop the \"FH Community Needs & Interests Survey\" and \"FH Post-Ce- remony Survey\". Community and participant needs and suggestions were articulated through interests and satisfaction surveys, and findings were integrated into CDEP planning/implementation activities. FH CDEP Study instruments for resident participants and youth and community participants include the following: Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) Client Outcome Measures, PARC Core Measures, CDEP Informed Consent, Friendship House Resident Satisfaction Survey, Youth Drug/Alcohol Use and Cultural Connectedness Survey, FH Community Needs and Interests Survey and FH Traditional Healer Post-Ceremony Survey. INSTRUMENT: GPRA Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) Client Outcome Measures Measure Type: QuantitativeTiming of Data Collection: Matched (Program Enrollment Interval).Protocol: Paper/pencil data collec- ted through a semi-interview format and administered onsite at FH.

The FH CDEP focuses on FH \"Healing through Ceremony\" practices, specifically Talking Circles, Sweat Lodge, Traditional Healer and Cultural Gatherings, for the target population of American Indians. American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) adults of the FH residential substance abuse treatment programs are studied through the lens of traditional ceremonies. For the Friendship House CDEP Study, adherence was tracked through total quality management tools, im- plementation tracking tools (GPRA Client Outcome Measures, Friendship House Resident Satisfaction Survey, Youth Drug/Alcohol Use and Cultural Connectedness Survey, FH Community Needs and Interests Survey and FH Traditional Healer Post-Ceremony Survey) and other mechanisms to assure that essential program ele- ments were conducted in accordance with program design. Friendship House traditional practices experienced small to significant interruptions\u2014mostly due to Shelter in Place protocols, were well-attended and often requested throughout the three-year study period. FH CDEP and evidence-based practices, relevant especially to the COVID 19 Pandemic were implemented immediately, across all programs. Practices most used included Case Management Care, Telehealth, and FH ceremonies/ gatherings. CDEP Program Differentiation The FH CDEP was piloted in Fiscal Year 2017 and 90 individuals were assessed using the draft-Core Meas- ures instrument, GPRA Tool and FH Resident Satisfaction Survey. Pre-implementation changes were made and included the following: 1) The tribal ceremony, \"Calling Back the Spirit\" was removed as a regular cere- mony for residential clients due to feedback from several clients that \"this ceremony was not a regular and/ or allowable tribal practice\" for them. It was replaced with Talking Circles. 2) The FH CDEP Study was revised from a quasi-experimental study design to a non-experimental study design - measuring variables as they naturally occur through the services of the organization. Issues that impeded the regular practices of CDEP-measured activities included the COVID 19 Pandem - ic, the California Wildfires, and the George Floyd Killing/BLM Racial Uprisings. COVID 19 Pandemic: Fiscal years 2020 and 2021 were especially challenging for meeting the service needs of the San Francisco Bay Area American Indian community due to the COVID-19 Pandemic. Childcare, education, income, homelessness and social isolation impacts (especially for American Indian elders) were major concerns. The implementation of Shelter in Place protocols led to immediate modifications in service delivery. Black Lives Matter Racial Uprising/California Wildfires: Higher levels of anxiety and emotional/psychological distress were reported by residents, youth participants and community members during the period of BLM Racial Uprisings, which was already impacted by the CA Wildfires, and COVID-19 Pandemic. Traditional healers held special group cere - monies and individual counseling sessions with residential clients, staff and community members, focused on39the healing steps that would need to take place to address the killing of Floyd George and discussed steps to take towards healing as a nation. Youth and young adults of FHYP used a variety of online platforms to support BLM efforts and to support one another, psychologically and emotionally. Impact of COVID 19 Pandemic on Sweat Lodge, Talking Circles, Traditional Healer Services and Youth/Community Gatherings: Sweat Lodge Ceremony: For FH CDEP ceremonies, FH Sweat Lodge ceremony was discontinued for thirteen months (February 2020 to February 2021) due to the COVID-19 Pandemic/Shelter in Place and San Francisco \"Spare the Air\" restrictions. A modified Sweat Lodge Ceremony was implemented for interested FH residents who made medicine ties and placed them in the sweat lodge for prayer ceremony. An in-person Sweat Lodge ceremony was held in March of 2021. Talking Circles: Once project staff were available onsite, Talking Circles were reconfigured to smaller resident groups (10 individuals or less) to ensure social distancing for safety. Traditional Healer Ceremony: No traditional healer ceremonies were held for a three-month period after which Traditional Healer (individual and group) ceremonies continued, using online platforms. As of February 2021, traditional healer group and individual sessions were held as live, small group sessions but with social distancing and regular space disinfection protocols in place. Youth and Community Gatherings: To help ensure AI/AN children, youth and young adults and their fami- lies had the resources (including academic and cultural support) readily available during this reporting period: FHYP established itself as a SF Community Hub, which allowed for longer hours of operation for in-person or virtual, online services. etc. From July 1, 2018 - June 30, 2021, FHYP , Native American Health Centers of Oak - land and San Francisco, Office of Indian Education, American Indian Cultural Center, MeWater and other key CBOs worked closely with one another to provide Native Community Wellness Check-Ins to 1982 Youth, 925 Young Adult and 2,135 Community Participants/Family Members. Wellness Check-Ins included: funds/transpor- tation/delivery of food boxes, water, laptops with internet access for students, home supplies, including disin- fectant supplies, face masks and hand sanitizers. FHYP and collaborators continued to provide Wellness Check- Ins through the end of June 30, 2021. Quality of Delivery Total quality management/continuous improvement strategies informed Friendship House's decision-mak- ing and CDEP program design by conducting high quality, consumer-driven evaluation activities. Traditional healers, project staff and community stakeholders were actively engaged in shaping the modifications made to the FH CDEP during this period, thereby shaping local evaluation activities, in general. Community stakehold- ers refer to residential clients, project staff and AI members of the local Bay Area community who participate in services. Feedback was generated through resident and youth satisfaction surveys; community needs and interests surveys; and post-ceremony participant feedback, follow-up meetings and post-ceremony facilitator survey. Information was shared and modifications were made as needed through the decisions at FH TRWG meetings, monthly grant meetings, and quarterly quality assurance meetings. Apart from CDEP modifications made in response to COVID 19/BLM Uprising/CA Wildfires, the Friendship House CDEP was implemented as planned across the three-year study period. 40Implementation of Data Analysis Plan The Friendship House Community Defined Evi - dence Practice (CDEP) is based on the FH Healing Model, using best practices in trauma informed services, substance abuse treatment and commu- nity wellness services; and incorporating traditional indigenous methods such as Sweat Lodge ceremo- nies, Traditional Healer ceremonies, Talking Circles, Gathering of Native Americans (GONA), etc. The FH CDEP Study provided an opportunity to study the programs and services of Friendship House through the lens of traditional healing practices. The FH CDEP Study focuses on FH \"Healing through Ceremony\" practices, specifically Talking Circles, Sweat Lodge, Traditional Healer and Cultural Gatherings, for the target population of American Indians. In addition, numerous evidence/ practice-based methods are implemented across the FH Residential Program and Youth Program and integrated into FH program practices. The FH CDEP is designed to answer the following research question: Does the integration of American Indian healing practices into service delivery efforts have a positive impact on program recipients' wellness (mental, spiritual, physical, emotional), social and economic engagement and cultural connected- ness? The CDEP evaluation measured changes in resident wellness and measured resident, youth, and com- munity engagement (social/economic) and cultural connectedness? The level of intervention for resi- dents - those who are \"at risk to high-risk\" or with early onset of mental illness, exhibited through substance abuse history. A combination of process evaluation measures (participation demographics and counts by ceremo- ny participation), outcomes evaluation measures (ANOVA; pre/post comparison measures and ratesatisfaction, cultural connectedness surveys), and formative evaluation measures (community needs and interests) enabled this project to manage, moni- tor and enhance its activities. The primary source of outcome evaluation data for those receiving services was SAMHSA's GPRA Client Outcome Measures Tool (SAMHSA CSAT GPRA Tool, 2019). The GPRA tool uses client-level interview questions to measure each participant's substance use, criminal activity, mental/physical health, education/employment status and social connectedness. The local evaluation also engaged in process evaluation to determine if FH ceremonies and gath- erings had been implemented as planned. Process evaluation involved tracking the implementation plan, determining how well the project followed that plan and helped to suggest adjustments to the plan where indicated. Process evaluation efforts also tracked other program outputs including number 41 The local evaluation assessed CDEP effectiveness through two process evaluation questions, nine outcome questions, and one formative evaluation question and includes the data collection and man - agement of several tools, including: GPRA Tool (completed at baseline and 6-month follow-up), FH Post-Ceremony Survey, FH Resident Satisfac- tion Survey, FH Community Needs and Interests Survey, Cultural Connectivity Scale and the Alcohol and Drug Use Survey. Through Accucare EHR, SPARS (GPRA data sys- tem) and other management information data- base system used by FH, data may be researched by race, ethnicity, age, gender, two-spirit, tribal affiliation, etc., to obtain intersectional data. Pre - liminary study findings were shared with stake - holders, including the FH TRWG, with the goal of influencing implementation decisions and practic - es. Quality management issues were addressed at monthly FH Contracts meetings and quarterly FH Quality Assurance Committee meetings.of ceremonies and gatherings held and number of individuals participating in each type of activity. This was accomplished through in-person or online registrations and activity sign-in sheets. Project staff tracked, logged and organized these data through Asset Panda, an online data management system used for tracking process data. Community Based Participatory Research (CBPR) activities were adopted to ensure inclusion of stake- holders in CDEP implementation and evaluation efforts. To support CBPR efforts, Friendship House conductedstakeholder surveys at community events throughout the 3-year study period. Community engagement strategies monitored performance and identified challenges and needed modifications. A Traditional Resources Work Group (FH TRWG) was established to review and help enhance the CDEP traditional components and local evaluation throughout the three-year study period. 42Results The Friendship House Community Defined Evidence Practice (FH CDEP) Study is based on the Friendship House Healing Model and resilience and recovery are examined through the lens of tribal and intertribal healing prac- tices, specifically Talking Circles, Traditional Healer Ceremony and Sweat Lodge Ceremony. Cultural gatherings that engage the FH Youth Program and American Indian community are studied to a lesser degree.

Do American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) healing practices have a positive impact on resident wellness (mental, spiritual, physical and emotional), so- cial and economic engagement and cultural connectedness? How are FH healing methods and non-Native evidence-based practices integrated in a manner that is complementary to foundational healing practices? Resident wellness is assessed in several ways, from program Intake to Discharge. Each client helps devel- op their own individualized treatment/recovery plan, inclusive of the following resident goals: 1) Remain abstinent - no drugs or alcohol. 2) Start and continue daily practices of self-care, using resources, skills and discipline learned through treatment, recovery and healing at FH. 3) Secure and maintain gainful employ- ment or actively engage in education or vocation training. 4) Secure and maintain stable housing. Stay crime-free and actively engaged in clearing or correcting past records (if applicable). 5) Stay socially and culturally connected in healthy ways to individuals, family and community. Accomplishment of these resident goals is the starting point to getting \"back on track\". Sustaining these goals, while recognizing and avoiding \"triggers\" and everyday barriers and challenges, is the ongoing part of healing and recovery from substance abuse. At FH, recovery and healing tools are identified or designed with the vulnerability of the FH client population, in mind. Traditional healing practices are the core meth- ods used for helping clients restore or learn more about their AI/AN identify and to connect to their tribe, family, workplace and community in productive and healthy ways. Friendship House provides a number of traditional healing practices on a regular basis, including Talking Circles, Sweat Lodge Ceremony, Tradi- tional Healer Group/Individual sessions, Wiping of the Tears, Red Road to Recovery curriculum, Gathering of Native Americans (GONA), Dance/Drum Circles, etc. All aspects of the FH Healing Model and CDEP are guided by American Indian concepts. From a cultural lens, do American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) healing practices have a positive impact on resident wellness (mental, spiritual, physical and emotional), social and economic engage- ment and cultural connectedness? Yes! Data analysis ( ANOVA; pre/post comparison measures and rate of change; and means, standard deviation, degrees of freedom, p values, t-scores) for GPRA measures showed positive gains across all indicators: abstinence from drug and alcohol use (from 41% at Intake to 76% at 6-month follow-up); reduced recidivism - no past 30-day criminal justice involvement\" (from 92% at Intake to 98% at 6-month follow-up change); and increases in clients reporting \"no health, behavioral, social consequences related to alcohol or illegal drug use\" (from 19.1% at Intake to 23.8%). Data analysis also showed improvement in clients' reporting of overall health. \"Very Good\" to \"Excellent \"- increased from 32% at Intake to 60%, six months later; and improvement in reporting of \"Considerably\" to \"Extremely\" bothered by psychological and emotional problems decreased from 35% at Intake to 13%, six-months later. Clients showed reductions for anxiety (decreased from 78% to 56%), depression (decreased from 59% to 40%), hallucinations59 (decreased from 7% to 1%), and suicide attempt (decreased from 2% to 0.3%). Last, client outcome data demonstrated positive gains in terms of injection drug use and risky behavior indicators: 11.3% of residents reported injection drug use in the prior 30 days at baseline, with a decrease to 3.3% six months later. 7.1% reported unprotected sexual contact with an injection drug user at baseline, with a decrease to 2.4% at 6-month follow-up; and 13.2% reported unprotected sexual contact with an individual high on some sub- stance at baseline, with a decrease to 2.4% at 6-month follow-up. How do FH healing methods integrate non-Native evidence-based practices in a manner that is comple- mentary to foundational healing practices and how are these non-Native practices chosen? Oftentimes for FH, compliance with local, state and federal grants requires the use of standardized evidence-based practices . As very few Native-based, standardized EVP's are available, oftentimes non-Native practices must be selected, for compliance purposes. Over the years, Friendship House has endeavored to integrate non-Na - tive practices that are complementary to Native practices across all FH programs. Today, FH is guided by numerous evidence-based practices, many of which are complementary to the FH Healing Model. For exam- ples, Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) activities assess the mental, physical and emotional needs of clients. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy focuses on emotional and mental issues and supportive therapy. 12-Step Treatment Model addresses the spiritual aspect of recovery and provides emo- tional support services. Together, these cover the four components (emotional, physical, mental and spiritual) of the Native Medicine Wheel. Case management care integrates a system of care, or community approach to cross-agency collaboration, and is complementary to Gathering of Native Americans (GONA) and Circles of Care approaches, for examples. CBT, Case Management Care and GONA approaches were widely used in the FHYP , as well. Is the integration of these Native and non-Native practices successful in maintaining the interest of youth and community members; and do FH practices support cultural identity and connections for residents and youth and community members of the AI community of the San Francisco Bay Area? Yes, and Yes! The impact of Friendship House efforts on FH AI youth participants up to age 24, examined over a two-year study period noted through their: 1) ongoing participation in American Indian activities related to culture, identity, history, arts (87%); 2) ongoing ceremony participation, including participation with family members (81%); and 3) engagement healing activities with traditional healers (78%). For cultural connections of residential clients, 86% of residents surveyed felt that their involvement wit h FH helped them to make a connection to the American Indian Community. To support CBPR efforts and monitor community needs and interests, FH conducts stakeholder surveys at community events throughout the year. Over the three-year study period, community members were asked to identify activities they would like to participate in - across an eleven-year study period (Lebron, 2020a), Traditional Native Activities was consistently chosen as number one choice for favorite type of activities to join (48%, 2018-2021, n=202; and compared to 53%, 2010-2019, n=1603); and Racism/Discrimination/Prejudice was consistently chosen as the number one problem affecting the AI community. Community and youth participants (n=202) were asked to identify the issues that affect our SF Bay Area American Indian Community: Number One Choice - 60Which practices stood out as most useful and relevant to the COVID 19 Pandemic, the California Wildfires and the George Floyd Killing/BLM Racial Uprisings? Fiscal years 2020 and 2021 were especially challenging for meeting the service needs of the San Francisco Bay Area American Indian community due to the COVID-19 Pandemic, t he California Wildfires and the George Floyd Killing/BLM Racial Uprisings . Childcare, education, income, homelessness and social isolation impacts (especially for American Indian elders), fear, depression and anxiety were major concerns for our community. FH CDEP and evidence-based practices, relevant especially to the COVID 19 Pandemic, were implemented across all programs. As a provider of community-based services, looking to public health models for guidance in addressing these issues in our community seemed like a good approach. Yet, missing from the public health model is an un- derstanding of how nonprofits and community-based organizations respond to crisis in their communities. In times of crisis, there is a great deal of community activity going on that is informal and fueled by word-of- mouth. And these approaches/services are not captured in a public health model. This in part, explains the gaps and disparities: if you do not know what the community really needs, and if you are not working at a level where you can see and experience the actual community-level response (which is always outweighed by the community's needs), then you will likely not provide that community with enough money to do what it needs to do to be culturally responsive in times of crisis. Friendship House (including FHYP), Native American Health Centers of Oakland and San Francisco, Office of Indian Education, American Indian Cultural Center, MeWater and other key CBOs rallied closely with one an - other and with federal, state and local funding sources, to provide 5,042 Native Community Wellness Check- Ins (Check-In counts by population: 1982, Youth; 925, Community Participants/Family Members). Wellness Check-Ins included: funds/transportation/delivery of food boxes, water, laptops. with internet access for students, and student/home supplies, including disinfectant supplies, face masks and hand sanitizers. FHYP and collaborators continued to provide Native Community Wellness Check-Ins through the end of the CDEP study period, June 30, 2021. Telehealth services increased significantly, due to COVID Shelter in Place protocols. Initially, software, hard - ware, safeguards and use policies had to be addressed/purchased/set-up. After this adjustment period, res- idents had access to numerous services from medical, physical and mental health practitioners as well as traditional practitioners and medicine people. Last, the Gathering of Native Americans (GONA) approach was widely used to conduct online gatherings and group meetings, focusing on three guiding principles of Vision , Circles of Relationships and Sense of Hope (SAMHSA-GONA Fact Sheet, 2016). Conclusion Friendship House Association of American Indians of San Francisco is one of many underfunded, yet highly ef- fective Native-serving organizations in California. There is no doubt the Native-based ceremonial practices are valued and effective in influencing positive outcomes amongst FH program residents and participants, as61demonstrated through process evaluation findings ( ceremony engagement and participation); outcomes evaluation findings (ANOVA; pre/post comparison measures and rate of change; and means, standard devi - ation, degrees of freedom, p values, t-scores); and formative evaluation findings (self-reported resident and youth cultural connectedness, resident satisfaction and community needs and interest ratings). In general, FH ceremonies experienced small to significant interruptions\u2014mostly due to Shelter in Place protocols, were well-attended and often requested throughout the three-year study period. Sweat Lodge ceremony was temporarily discontinued, and Talking Circles and Traditional Healer ceremonies were implemented with con- sideration of the day-to-day experiences of the Native community. FH CDEP and evidence-based practices, relevant especially to the COVID 19 Pandemic were implemented immediately, across all programs - practices most used included the Case Management of Care Model, Telehealth and FH CDEP ceremonies. Still, here is no \"one size fits all\" in relationship to the selection of intertribal practices (or evidence -based practices). For example, Talking Circles is a well-known tribal/intertribal practice and implemented widely throughout Indian country. However, FH residential satisfaction survey findings across a two-year period, indicated that many individuals did not favor Talking Circles as a program activity. In addition, \"Calling Back of the Spirit\" was removed as a regular ceremony, due to feedback from several residential clients that \"this ceremony was not a regular and/or allowable tribal practice\" for them. Every year at Friendship House, approximately 100 or more unique tribes/tribal bands are represented through program services. Given this tribal diversity, understanding the complexity of FH services and how intertribal practices and non-Native evidence-based practices are chosen, and integrated in a manner that is complementary to foundational healing practices, is essential. In general, more indigenous research is need- ed to understand the significance of AI/AN organizational learning and cultural practices and how these facili - tate effective service delivery and positive outcomes for American Indians/Alaska Natives across the lifespan, in everyday life and in times of chaos and/or trauma. Going Forward The FH CDEP Study provided an opportunity to examine the programs and services and Friendship House healing practices through the lens of ceremony. In 2021, FH developed a Traditional Practices Mentorship Program and began to seek funding support for its implementation. Native mentorship and apprenticeship services will help to ensure that American Indian and Alaska Native healing practices are passed forward to the next generations of AI/AN healers and traditional practitioners.62References American Psychiatric Organization.
