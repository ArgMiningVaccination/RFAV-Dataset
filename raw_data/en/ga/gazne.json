I used to be a scared mom, frantically searching for answers and feeling powerless in the face of Western medicine's dismissal of my son's very real problems. And I've gotta tell ya, I wouldn't wish that helplessness on anyone. My family deserved more than shrugged shoulders and placating statements as we were ushered from exam rooms, and so does yours. A health care model that invalidated us couldn't be the best option. What started as a distraught attempt to help my child feel better grew into a deep passion for pursuing true wellness - a realignment with the body's natural state of health. And the more I learned, the more I wanted to share. Needless to say, my enthusiasm lead to learning multiple modalities over the years. Here are the credentials: Registered Nurse, MSN Starting my health care career in Western medicine was a blessing. First, it gave me a variety of experience that's allowed me to hold space for people in all stages of health or illness. Second, having this intimate knowledge allowed me to ultimately see how alternative health was the right move for my family. My portfolio as a registered nurse has included critical care, emergency care, respiratory, maternity, cardiac, radiology, pain management, spine and neurology, outpatient clinic services, field midwife, volunteering, and more. When I pursued my Master of Science in Nursing, I wanted to focus on caring for the whole person as their health landscape changes, and how as health care providers we can best support the journey. To learn more about this, I studied change management, ethical health systems, patient safety, and the litigation system of healthcare. Doctoral Student: PhD in Quantum Physics, Neuroscience & Healing Modalities In between caring for patients and my own kiddos, I opted to pursue a very unique doctorate degree. One on the cutting edge of how healing is viewed and applied. This perfectly marries my love of frequency based medicine and the evolution of human consciousness within the field of neuroscience. It's where I get to nerd out and then bring these new scientific discoveries back to my clients. Certified Exponential Health Coach Building Biology Practitioner This new approach to healthcare involves empowering health participants to be their own healers.
