With that comes a natural tendency to look back and assess the achievements of the past, but also to look ahead, to anticipate trends, and setbold new plans for the future. Today, Alberta stands at the crossroads. We're leaving behind a century that saw the birth of the province, the hard work and determination of our early pioneers, the development of oneof Canada's strongest agricultural industries, the discovery of oil and the extraction of oilfrom the tar sands, the subsequent diversification of our economic base, building leadingedge education and health systems, and welcoming thousands of people from across Canadaand around the world. It's been an exciting century for Alberta. Now we look ahead to a new century ... a century of untold promise.It's time to shift our focus to the future. While there is much to celebrate about Alberta's first century, there are challenges ahead and new opportunities to address. Meeting thosechallenges will demand the bold approach Albertans are known for across Canada. Alberta is uniquely positioned to take advantage of the opportunities a new century brings. From our early pioneers, we learned that sheer determination and hard work are key tosuccess. In business and industry, we learned that innovation and new ideas bring a solidcompetitive advantage. In health, education and other key areas of the public sector, welearned that people make the difference - highly skilled and committed teachers, educators,doctors, nurses, health providers and dedicated public servants. Through some difficult financial times, we learned that making tough decisions, spending only what you can afford, and paying down debt is the best long term strategy. FromAlbertans, we learned the importance of being bold, not settling for the status quo, tacklingissues head on, and caring for each other, especially those who need our help. With these lessons in mind, it's time to set bold new plans for the future. It's time to close one chapter in the history books and open the next. BOLD NEW PLANS As we begin a new century, Alberta faces a number of challenges. \u007f A tough, competitive global economy\u007f Addressing the increasing importance of knowledge and innovation\u007f Continuing pressures on the health system and the need to try new approaches\u007f Creating an environment for Alberta's children to get an excellent start in life in safe, happy and healthy families and communities \u007f Building opportunities for young people to learn, expand their skills and build their futures here in AlbertaGovernment of Alberta Business Plan 2000-03GOVERNMENT BUSINESS PLAN 2000-03 4To address those challenges, the government will put bold new plans in place, plans that are based on clear principles. \u007f Fiscal responsibility - managing the province's resources wisely, paying down debt and keeping taxes low \u007f Innovation - trying new ideas, seeking new solutions, and making changes that benefit the province and Albertans \u007f Equity - ensuring fairness for all Albertans and respect for diversity of culture, age, and gender \u007f Balance - balancing development and sustainability, saving and spending These principles of fiscal responsibility, innovation, equity, and balance are the foundation of the business plan and are addressed in both parts of the plan. Together, the first part, a seriesof goals and strategies undertaken by individual ministries and the second, a collection offour cross-government initiatives represent the combined three-year plan of the Albertagovernment. The cross-government initiatives engage people from various ministries in finding innovative, effective and productive ways of meeting people's needs. This cooperativeapproach recognizes the reality that many issues are not isolated to a single ministry. Theinitiatives include: 1. the Economic Development Strategy 2. the Aboriginal Policy Initiative3. the Alberta Corporate Service Centre Initiative4. the Corporate Human Resource Development Strategy Overall, the business plan will focus this government's efforts for the next three years in five critical areas: \u007f agriculture \u007f our economy\u007f education\u007f taxes\u007f health care ADDRESSING A CHANGING AGRICUL TURAL INDUSTRY Farming has been at the heart of Alberta's economy for the past century and we needconcerted efforts to preserve that tradition for tomorrow's generation of farmers. Today'sagricultural industry is going through significant changes and difficult times. Some familyfarms are finding it difficult to survive. Low world commodity prices, rising costs ofproduction and unfavourable trade practices in other countries are putting pressure on theagricultural industry in Alberta and all prairie provinces. Highly competitive markets meanagricultural producers continually need to search for new, value-added products and newmarketplaces to sell their goods.5 GOVERNMENT BUSINESS PLAN 2000-03There are no easy solutions. As a critical step, an Agriculture Summit will be held in the spring of 2000. That Summit will lay the groundwork for future actions to preserve Alberta'sfarm economy. A comprehensive review of the crop insurance program will be undertaken,innovative business opportunities will be supported, and efforts to open up new markets forvalue-added products will be expanded. The provincial government will also work with the federal government to advance the interests of Alberta's agricultural producers in improved trade rules and access to markets. IMPLEMENTING A NEW ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY In positioning the province for continued prosperity, Alberta faces a fiercely competitive,global marketplace. People, business and investment are highly mobile and can move quicklyto wherever they get the best advantage or return on their investment. Knowledge andinnovation are replacing assembly line factories and manual labour as the critical componentsof thriving economies around the world. To address those challenges, government will move forward on a new economic development strategy. Get Ready Alberta is designed to do just that - to get the province and the people ready for a very different economy, the economy of the future. The new strategy will focus the province's efforts in four key areas:\u007fUnleashing innovation - making Alberta a world leader in innovation, research, development and commercialization of new ideas. A new Alberta Heritage Foundationfor Science and Engineering Research is a key step in attracting research anddevelopment to the province. \u007fLeading in learning - ensuring that all Albertans have the opportunities to learn, adapt and develop new knowledge and new skills. Expanded access to high speed Internetconnections will give people access to learning any time, anywhere. \u007fCompeting in a global marketplace - taking steps so that Alberta is internationally recognized as a good place to invest and do business and Alberta businesses compete andsucceed in a global marketplace. Steps will be taken to implement a new InternationalStrategy. \u007fMaking Alberta the best place to live, work and visit - ensuring that Albertans enjoy an unmatched quality of life in a province that's recognized as the best place to live, workand visit. Alberta's tourism industry will be expanded, steps will be taken to protect andsustain Alberta's environment, and the diversity and excitement of Alberta's culture, arts,sports, festivals and volunteer spirit will be promoted. A key target of the new strategy is to create a climate that will see 295,000 new jobs created in the province by December 2005.GOVERNMENT BUSINESS PLAN 2000-03 6PROVIDING EXCELLENT EDUCATION AND TRAINING It is of utmost importance that Alberta's children and youth have opportunities to learn, achieve and take their place in a highly competitive global marketplace. This business plan will help pre-school children get a healthy start in life as we follow through on the recommendations of the Children's Forum and the Premier's Task Force onChildren at Risk. Once they start school, our aim is to ensure that children receive the best education in Canada. At the basic education level, work will focus on addressing class size and services forspecial needs students. A review of fundraising and school fees will be undertaken. The newAlberta Initiative for School Improvement will support projects designed to improve studentlearning. A new information and communications technology program will be introduced. At the post-secondary level, opportunities for students will be increased by supporting additional places in colleges, universities and technical institutes and expandingapprenticeship opportunities. Additional funding will be provided to ensure that studentshave the financial support they need to complete their education. That will include increasedfunding for student awards, extended eligibility for an interest relief program, and a newscholarship for second year post-secondary students. MAINTAINING ALBERTA'S TAX ADVANTAGE Albertans pride themselves on paying the lowest taxes in Canada. But it is critical that wemaintain this advantage and position Alberta to compete not only with other provinces butalso with our competitors in the United States and around the world. The provincial government has taken important steps in the past few years to lower taxes. Ultimately, tax dollars belong not to government but to the people who pay them. Thosedollars are entrusted to government to support programs Albertans value. As part of this business plan, government will move forward with plans to reform the personal income tax system, introducing a new single rate tax on income and providing afinancial benefit to Alberta families. In January this year, we removed the surtax. That will befollowed by comprehensive legislation introducing a new tax system - a system that willresult in 132,000 low income Albertans paying no provincial income tax whatsoever. Plans will proceed for reducing education property tax rates and a longer term review and consultation on education property taxes will be completed. In addition, business taxes inthe province will be reviewed by the Alberta Business Tax Review Committee to see howAlberta's taxes stack up against the competition and to recommend changes. SUSTAINING ALBERTA'S HEAL TH SYSTEM Health care is the number one concern of Albertans and a major issue facing all Canadians. Alberta's population is growing and aging. New technologies, treatments and medications add to the cost of maintaining the health system. Today, one out of every three dollars theprovincial government spends goes to health care. We have a good health care system. Butsimply doing more of the same will not be sufficient to address the mounting pressures oftoday or sustain the system for future generations of Albertans.7 GOVERNMENT BUSINESS PLAN 2000-03In this business plan, government commits to a comprehensive six-point plan. 1. Improve access to publicly funded health services Government will continue to ensure that the health system is properly funded. Over the next three years, spending on health will continue to increase. The additional money willbe used to hire more nurses and other health providers, to recruit more doctors andincrease residency positions in medical schools, to reduce waiting lists for heart surgery,joint replacements, cancer treatment and neurosurgery, and to open more long term carebeds. 2. Improve management of the health system A new Health Services Utilization Commission will monitor and assess the health system's performance and recommend improvements. 3. Improve the quality of health services Building on a number of pilot projects across the province, steps will be taken to expand primary care. These new approaches will improve access to doctors, reduce pressures onhospital emergency wards, and provide community-based clinics with access to teams ofhealth professionals and others who can help meet people's needs. Greater partnershipand teamwork among health professionals will be encouraged and discussions will beginthis year on ways of using nurse practitioners in new and creative ways. 4. Emphasize promotion of good health and prevention of illness and injury A new immunization plan and province-wide screening programs for breast cancer, cervical cancer and inherited disorders of metabolism in newborns will be criticalcomponents of new plans to promote good health. 5. Foster new ideas Continuing innovation is critical to the future of Alberta's health system. A new Premier's Advisory Council on Health will bring forward the best new ideas andapproaches from across Canada and around the world on how we can maintain ourpublic health system. 6. Protect public health care Legislation will be introduced to protect Alberta's publicly funded health system. Clear rules will be put in place for contracting out certain surgeries that require overnightstays. LOOKING AHEAD WITH CONFIDENCE Looking ahead, Alberta is well poised to continue our tradition of hard work, drive anddetermination. We have every reason to look forward to the future - to a new century -with the confidence that we will tackle whatever challenges come our way and succeed.The business plans of ministries, which are also contained in this volume, detail the actionsgovernment will take to meet these challenges.GOVERNMENT BUSINESS PLAN 2000-03 8GOALS AND STRATEGIES Government's actions are focused on three core businesses: People, Prosperity and Preservation.

[original signed]Ty Lund, Minister of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development February 2, 2000AGRICULTURE, FOOD AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT BUSINESS PLAN 2000-03 30INTRODUCTION The agri-food sector continues to be a key contributor to Alberta's economic prosperity: \u007f Farm production is Alberta's largest renewable resource-based industry. In 1998, the primary sector generated $6.4 billion in farm cash receipts, representing 21.7 per cent of Canada's primary agricultural output. Alberta farmers continue to increase their farmcash receipts relative to other provinces. Alberta averaged 20.1 per cent of Canada's primary output between 1989 and 1993. \u007f Secondary agricultural processing, including the food and beverage processing industries, is Alberta's largest manufacturing sector. Shipments set a new record for output in 1998 at $7.5 billion in sales. Alberta shipments now represent 12.6 per cent of Canadian foodand beverage shipments, up from the average 10.9 per cent over the period 1989 to 1993. \u007f Primary agriculture combined with the food and beverage manufacturing industry was the third largest employer in the province in 1998. Employment in agriculture and food averaged 102,000 during 1998. The agri-food sector offers significant potential for expansion in the years ahead: \u007f The industry and the Ministry believe there is an opportunity for the industry to grow to $20 billion in value-added shipments and $10 billion in farm cash receipts by 2005 to 2010. \u007f Achieving these growth levels would result in a sizable increase in direct employment in primary production and in the food and beverage sector, as well as contributing to thefurther development of rural Alberta. The Ministry contributes to rural development by encouraging technology adoption, leadership and skill development, economic growth, environmental stewardship, riskmanagement, physical infrastructure and regulations that are aligned with the goals and opportunities of self-reliant communities and industries. The Ministry contributes to the government's three core businesses - People, Prosperity and Preservation . Our primary focus is on the second core business - working with others to promote prosperity for Alberta through a strong, competitive agriculture and food industry that is sustainable and environmentally responsible. Note: The Ministry Goals, Key Results, Measures, Strategies and Actions reflect activities of the Agriculture, Food and Rural Development Department; Agriculture Financial Services Corporation; Alberta OpportunityCompany; Alberta Dairy Control Board; Farmers' Advocate; Irrigation Council; Surface Rights Board; Land Compensation Board; Agricultural Products Marketing Council; and Alberta Grain Commission.31 AGRICULTURE, FOOD AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT BUSINESS PLAN 2000-03VISION We are a Ministry of competent and valued staff working together and in partnership with others to achieve a world class industry.

The creation of a new Ministry of Children's Services signals the strong commitment of this government to support children and their families as they deal with these issues. Over the next three years, we will build on the direction and vision of communities for their childrenand families, and the initial steps taken with Ministry partners . We will build on existing relationships and foster new ones to support positive outcomes for our children, our families and our communities. There are significant expectations for this new Ministry. It's an opportunity for us, as a province, to focus on the needs of children and their families - to ensure that we meet our shared responsibility to care for our children and youth, especially those that need our helpthe most. We must remain fiscally responsible while realizing the benefits to be gained by investing in children and providing early supports before crises occur. Our continued economic and social success depends on ensuring that our children are safe and reach theirfull potential. This, the first business plan for the new Ministry, defines our strategy for meeting the needs of Alberta children and families. It outlines the goals, strategies, and performance measureswe will use as a Ministry to ensure we make the best use of our resources to achieve our vision. We are committed to working in partnership with community boards, Authorities, and other departments. Through a number of different approaches we will advance currentmodels and create new ways to meet the needs of those most at risk. This three-year business plan is a beginning. We will join with Albertans to carefully monitor our progress and make changes in our future business plans based on the needs ofchildren and families in Alberta. Putting together a solid business plan is only the start. We have to follow through on each of the goals and strategies contained in this plan if we're really going to make a difference in the lives of children and families. [original signed] Iris Evans Minister47 CHILDREN'S SERVICES BUSINESS PLAN 2000-03ALBERTA CHILDREN'S SERVICES The Ministry represents a dynamic and committed partnership between Child and Family Services Authorities (CFSAs), Family and Community Support Services (FCSS), the Youth Secretariat, the Children's Advocate, other partnering departments and the Department of Children's Services. We have a shared accountability for achieving these goals and results setout in this Business Plan. Working with their communities, eighteen Child and Family Services Authorities have assumed responsibility for managing services and resources for children and families with theinvolvement of communities. Each Child and Family Services Authority prepares a business plan for their region that identifies the goals, strategies and measures for 2000-2003 in response to community needs and priorities. These business plans are linked to the overallvision and direction for Alberta's children, and the key areas of change that were identified in consultations with Albertans, including the first Children's Forum and the preliminary results from the Task Force on Children at Risk. The Ministry Business Plan builds on thefollowing community priorities as well as the overall strategic direction of government to ensure that Alberta's children, particularly those at risk, are safe, well cared-for, successful at learning and healthy: \u007f Planning and service delivery will be integrated at the community, regional and provincial levels to facilitate barrier-free access to services for children and families. \u007f Communities will support the principle of participation and access for all. The role of support networks and cultural groups will be integrated and expanded within the professional delivery of service. \u007f Aboriginal communities will assume responsibility for planning and delivering services for Aboriginal children and families. The values, cultural and spiritual beliefs and customs of First Nations, Metis and other Aboriginal people will be respected and be part of a collaborative system. \u007f Timely, accessible services will be available to assist and support children and families to develop skills, to build on their strengths, and reduce the need for crisis intervention. Alberta children and families will be free from abuse and neglect. \u007f Support will be provided for community advocacy and development of programs focusing on prevention, preservation of families and positive relationships. This business plan is built on the involvement of our partners and stakeholders who share a common vision for Alberta children and families. We recognize the interdependency of children, families and communities, the importance of integration in our strategies and services, and of supporting communities and partners in developing collaborative approachesto meeting the needs of children and families. VISION FOR ALBERTA CHILDREN'S SERVICES Strong children, families and communities. Our shared vision is an Alberta where children and youth are valued, nurtured and loved; developing to their potential, supported by enduring relationships, healthy families and safe communities. Alberta will be child, youth and family friendly.CHILDREN'S SERVICES BUSINESS PLAN 2000-03 48MINISTRY MISSION STATEMENT Working together to enhance the ability of families and communities to develop nurturing and safe environments for children, youth and individuals. CHILDREN'S SERVICES CORE BUSINESSES Children's Services recognizes that the primary responsibility for children lies with theparents. Recognizing the role of parents and caregivers, the provincial government has a legislated responsibility for children's services shared with parents, communities, Child and Family Services Authorities (CFSAs), practitioners, other orders of government, and thepublic. The following core businesses and goals reflect the shared accountability of Authorities and organizations, including the Department, that form the Ministry of Children's Services. It also reflects the Ministry's relationship with municipalities, throughFamily and Community Support Services in achieving positive outcomes for Alberta children and families. Within this system of shared responsibility and co-operation, Alberta Children's Services, under the direction of the Minister, takes the lead in: CORE BUSINESS 1: SUPPORTING THE WELL-BEING AND HEALTHY DEVELOPMENT OF CHILDREN AND YOUTH Through services provided by the Child and Family Services Authorities, the Ministry will continue to ensure that Alberta children and families are safe and free from abuse and neglect. Children's Services will also be working with Ministry partners to increase thecapacity of children and youth to develop to their full potential, by providing prevention, promotion and early supports to children and families. CORE BUSINESS 2: SUPPORTING FAMILIES, GUARDIANS, CARE-GIVERS AND INDIVIDUALS Recognizing the role of the family and care-givers, Children's Services will work with Authorities, Family and Community Support Services and other partners to provide supports to families that increase their capacity to provide nurturing and protective environments for children. We will encourage new approaches to supporting children and youth in thedevelopment of life-long, nurturing relationships. Ministry partners will also work to prevent family violence and address its impact on children and families. CORE BUSINESS 3: SUPPORTING HEALTHY COMMUNITIES Children's Services will support a community-based approach to delivery of services to children and families. Through support to Authorities, Aboriginal communities, municipalities and community-based programming through Family and Community Support Services, the Ministry will work to increase the ability of communities to meet theneeds of their children and families. CORE BUSINESS 4: PROMOTING ADVOCACY FOR CHILDREN, YOUTH AND THOSE AT RISK The Ministry will continue to provide advocacy services to children and youth through the Children's Advocate. In addition, the Ministry will support increased public involvement,understanding and knowledge of issues affecting children and families, and will work to provide opportunities for children, youth, families and communities to have a voice in decision making.49 CHILDREN'S SERVICES BUSINESS PLAN 2000-03CORE BUSINESS 5: SUPPORTING HIGH QUALITY, ACCOUNTABLE SERVICES Children's Services will work to increase the satisfaction of community and stakeholders with the services they receive from the Ministry. The Ministry will work within the context of the government shared services strategy to ensure effective human resource, financial and information technology management. We will also support and assist Child and FamilyServices Authority boards and Family and Community Support Services board volunteers to ensure effective and accountable governance. By working with our partners and developing new partnerships, the Ministry will promote effective approaches to addressing the issuesfacing children and families, and an integrated, child-centred, and family focused system of services. CORE BUSINESS 6: SUPPORTING INNOVATION AND TRAINING Children's Services will continue to work with Ministry partners to ensure that Child and Family Services practitioners are highly skilled and trained. The Ministry will ensure that training programs are developed to support effective staff deployment and use of technology. By encouraging innovative approaches and building on best practices, we will work todevelop a culture of continuous learning and improvement. OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES SIGNIFICANT TRENDS, ISSUES AND COMMUNITY PRIORITIES ECONOMIC TRENDS Since 1997, Gross Domestic Product has increased at an annual rate of approximately 3%. Employment growth has also been strong - the number of Albertans who are unemployedhas declined from approximately 135,000 in 1992 to just under 92,000 in 1998. In spite of strong economic and employment growth, the number of Albertans living in poverty has not changed dramatically. The number of children living in poverty declined in 1997, butalso remained relatively constant over the period 1992 to 1996. DEMOGRAPHICS Alberta's population growth has been strong, increasing a total of 7.5% over the past fiveyears. The total number of children in Alberta has grown at a slower rate than thepopulation as a whole - 1.9% between 1994 and 1998. The change in the number of children aged 0-19 has varied significantly across the province, with some regions experiencing a decline in this age group while others experienced significant growth (over13%). The growth in the number of Aboriginal/First Nations children has been faster than non-Aboriginals. Aboriginal people now represent approximately 6% of Alberta's total population and approximately 46% are under 20 years of age. Alberta is projected tocontinue to have a net in-flow of immigrants and people from other provinces over the next three years. SOCIAL TRENDS Between 1995 and 1997, the number of children in single parent families has increased almost four times faster than the number of children in two-parent families. The rate of births to teenage mothers (aged 10-17) has been declining in Alberta, but still remains aboveCHILDREN'S SERVICES BUSINESS PLAN 2000-03 50the national average. Alberta's infant mortality rates have been declining since 1994. The number of low birth weight babies as a percent of total live births has increased between 1992 and 1997. There is a significant variation of these rates across regions. Youth crime generally has been declining (especially property crimes), however violent crime rates foryouth (12-17 years) have remained relatively constant since 1991. The proportion of Alberta students who successfully completed high school within six years of entering grade nine has remained relatively constant over the period 1992 to 1997. REGIONAL TRENDS A number of provincial trends have been identified by Child and Family Services Authorities within their Business Plans. Overall, most regions reported the following as key factors affecting the needs of children: \u007f There has been an increased number of people seeking Handicapped Children's Services and the complexity of needs of children with disabilities has also increased. \u007f Poverty, child poverty and income disparity are problems in many regions.\u007f There is a high proportion of Aboriginal children with high needs in many regions. OTHER SIGNIFICANT TRENDS/ISSUES There has been an increased focus on meeting the early developmental needs of children at the provincial and federal level. Research demonstrates that the early years of development,particularly the first three years, establish the foundation that will affect learning, behaviour and health throughout life. This research supports the work being done through the National Children's Agenda, and will create increased expectations for all provincialMinistries to develop and enhance supports that foster healthy early child development within safe and supportive environments. PRIORITY AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT Priority areas for improving services to Alberta's children and families have been identified from information on performance measures, implementation of the Ministry three year business plan, a review of Child and Family Services Authority three year business plans, the annual report of the Children's Advocate, and most recently from information received atthe Children's Forum. In addition to working with partners and stakeholders to ensure a quality range of supports for children and families, the following priority improvement areas are addressed in this plan for the fiscal years 2000/2001 to 2002/2003: \u007fprevention and early supports for children and families - improving outcomes for children and families by providing a broader range of prevention services and early supports; \u007fimproving communication, collaboration and consultation in all areas of the Ministry by involving partners and stakeholders in a meaningful way, in planning and decision- making; \u007fimproving services and early supports for youth in consultation with the Youth Secretariat and in response to the recommendations of the Task Force on Children at Risk, and the annual report of the Children's Advocate; \u007fimproving services for Aboriginal children and families by enhancing partnerships and supporting increased capacity of Aboriginal communities to deliver services that meet the needs of their children and families;51 CHILDREN'S SERVICES BUSINESS PLAN 2000-03\u007fensuring accountability of the system through support for Ministry partners, timely release of information, and the development of a performance measurement framework that is focused on outcomes for children and families, including core measures to monitor system effectiveness and efficiency; \u007fimproving information technology management - financial reporting and human resources management within the framework of the overall government Information Technology Strategy and Corporate Human Resource Development Strategy, andthrough working with the corporate shared services centre for government; \u007fimproving the knowledge and skills of staff by providing increased training and professional development opportunities for staff and managers, and to ultimately benefitchildren by identifying more innovative ways of doing business. KEY INITIATIVES Major initiatives, which respond to the key challenges identified, include: CHILDREN'S FORUM The Children's Forum is an annual event that will bring together parents, youth, stakeholders, citizens, concerned groups and service providers, business and community leaders, the provincial government, social workers and teachers, and community volunteers towork towards the well-being of children. CHILDREN AT RISK TASK FORCE This task force examined the issues facing all children at risk, including those who are at risk of developing violent behaviors. Recommendations will ensure that public programs and services in this province for children at risk are effectively co-ordinated and targeted toeffectively meet the needs of these children. YOUTH SECRETARIAT The Youth Secretariat will provide a mechanism through which issues affecting youth (13 years of age to 21 years of age) can be addressed. Through discussions with other departments and community stakeholders, the Youth Secretariat will identify issues andneeds of adolescents in Alberta. CHILD WELFARE CASELOAD REVIEW The Ministry will complete a review of factors leading to rising child welfare caseloads that will include an identification of 'best practices' and opportunities for improvement. REVIEW OF CHILDREN'S ADVOCATE The Ministry has made a commitment to complete a review of the Office of the Children's Advocate to ensure it reflects the new reality of children's services throughout the province.

[original signed] Stan Woloshyn, Minister of Community Development February 2, 2000COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT BUSINESS PLAN 2000-03 62VISION A strong province with a high quality of life and fair opportunity for all Albertans through the support of community goals and aspirations. MISSION To support community development, and through leadership, protection and partnership, help allAlbertans participate fully in the social, cultural and economic life of the province. Alberta Community Development provides leadership in building a high quality of life for all Albertans through its five core businesses: 1. promoting community development; 2. supporting the independence and well-being of seniors; 3. protecting human rights and promoting fairness and access; 4. preserving, protecting and presenting Alberta's unique natural, cultural and historical resources; and 5. supporting Alberta's special purpose housing needs. The ministry's success in enhancing the quality of life of Alberta's strong and diverse communities lies in its focus on productive partnerships, an energetic and growing volunteer base, and working with community-based organizations funded through the lottery-fundedfoundations. Building innovative partnerships with cooperating societies, private sector corporations and community organizations, to share resources, reduce duplication and costs, and broadensupport for community initiatives, will enable effective achievement of business plan goals. In addition, Community Development is committed to working collaboratively with ministries across government to ensure the success of broader government priorities. Theministry will participate in, and provide leadership and support for, key cross-government priorities, including the Alberta Corporate Services Centre Initiative, Corporate Human Resource Development Strategy, Economic Development Strategy and Aboriginal PolicyInitiative. Support to the Children's Services Initiative, Capital Planning, Climate Change and Municipal Government will continue. The ministry will provide leadership for an additional key cross-government initiative, Seniors Policy, which will mobilize the collectiveefforts of government to meet seniors' needs for the future. Due to the importance of cross- government and other partnerships in the achievement of ministry goals, ministry actions that have an important collaborative component have been highlighted with an asterisk. The ministry will continue its support to development of volunteerism, including coordination of provincial activities for the International Year of Volunteers in 2001. Working with government and external partners on services to children and youth will be apriority, especially in the areas of arts, libraries, sport and recreation and youth leadership development. Planning for the long-term sustainability of, and accessibility to, Alberta's programs for seniors will continue to be an important focus of the ministry's business plan. This plan includes actions to ensure the growing numbers of seniors have access to the supports they63 COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT BUSINESS PLAN 2000-03need to live in a secure and dignified way as independent and contributing members of society. Seniors housing will be integrated with other programs and services for seniors, improving access to services for seniors. Working to ensure that families and individuals most in need have access to basic housing accommodation will be central to the ministry's strategies for effective management and coordination of special purpose housing programs. The ministry will promote community- based, inexpensive housing initiatives in partnership with government departments,municipalities, community-based organizations, industry, private and non-profit housing organizations and housing management bodies. This business plan will continue its focus on actions to foster equality and reduce discrimination, including educational initiatives to promote fairness and access and increase understanding of the growing diversity in the province. Strategies to ensure effective operation of the Human Rights and Citizenship Services Commission will continue to beimplemented. This business plan recognizes Albertans' desire to respect the past and learn from the experiences of our forebears. Alberta has a rich heritage to preserve and to present, and theministry's network of 18 historic sites, museums and interpretive centres, as well as its cultural facilities, attest to the value Albertans place on this rich heritage. This business plan includes steps to preserve the future of the ministry's heritage infrastructure, including areplacement facility for the Provincial Archives of Alberta. As well, the creative energies of Albertans will be showcased as they welcome the millennium, including a special exhibition, Jesus Through the Centuries , and begin preparations for the celebration of the 100 th anniversary of Alberta becoming a province. MINISTRY CORE BUSINESSES 1. PROMOTING COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT Promoting the development of Alberta's communities and increasing the capacity of community organizations for self-reliance are key goals of the ministry. The ministryprovides on-site community development assistance through its regional office system and supports Alberta's quality of life through technical and financial support to the arts, recreation, sport, library and volunteer sectors of the province. GOAL To work in partnership with geographic communities and communities of interest to build and maintain a high quality of life in Alberta. This goal will be met by:\u007f Helping communities help themselves through the provision of organizational assistance and facilitation services. \u007f Increasing community self-reliance and self-sufficiency through financial support and consultative services aimed toward the development of local resources and effective use of volunteers. \u007f Supporting the development of arts and culture as fundamental assets of Alberta's quality of life by providing financial assistance and consultative services.COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT BUSINESS PLAN 2000-03 64\u007f Coordinating and supporting a province-wide library system with financial assistance and consultative services. \u007f Assisting Albertans in making informed choices through the classification of films. \u007f Encouraging, through financial support and education programs, participation in healthy physical activity and recreation that leads to wellness. \u007f Contributing to the athletic achievement of young Albertans through financial and consultative support to the provincial sport system. This goal is intended to achieve the following desired outcomes: \u007f Partnerships with communities that increase self-reliance and maintain a high quality of life in Alberta. \u007f Strong contribution by Alberta volunteers to all aspects of community life. \u007f Broad participation by Albertans, particularly children and youth, in arts, recreation, sport and library activities. \u007f Significant contribution to the economy of the province by the arts and cultural industries. \u007f A well-informed public through classification of films.

This measure represents the satisfaction rating for services delivered through the ministry's regionaloffices. In 1998-99, the average satisfaction rating was 98%. The target is to maintain this high level of client satisfaction; the minimum acceptable service level is an 85% satisfaction rating. \u007fLevel of community volunteerism. The percentage of Albertans who volunteer provides an indicator of the impact of the ministry's support to volunteer organizations, particularly in the arts and cultural, and sport and recreation sectors. In 1998-99, 72%of Albertans participated in volunteer activities. The target for 1999-2000 was 55%; however, a new target is being developed for 2000-2001. \u007fPercentage of population participating in sport and recreation activities.

Arts organizations raised 75% of their revenues from the private sector during 1997-98. The target is 75%. The economic impact of the arts and cultural industries in Alberta is represented by annual revenues reported by Alberta Foundation for the Arts funding recipients, multiplied byan industry standard multiplier. In 1997-98, the foundation partnered funds of $16.9 million to arts and cultural organizations, who in turn generated a $285 million economic impact for Alberta. The target is $256 million. The success of the AlbertaFilm Development Program in supporting film making in Alberta is measured by: the number of film production opportunities offered to Alberta's actors, musicians, designers, writers, producers and directors; the number of films made each year in the province; andthe dollar value of film production by Albertans in Alberta each year.

[original signed] Jon Havelock, Minister of Economic Development February 3, 2000ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT BUSINESS PLAN 2000-03 78INTRODUCTION Over the past five years, Alberta's economy expanded at an annual average rate of 3.8%, the fastest rate of growth in Canada. Increased trade, tourism and investment have driven this growth. During this period, our international trade in goods and services grew, on average, by almost 10% a year. Investments in our manufacturing and service industry increased, onaverage, by 5% a year. Alberta's tourism revenue has grown from $3.5 billion in 1995 to an estimated $4.2 billion in 1999. Alberta's reliance on trade, tourism and investment to grow our economy continues to present opportunities and challenges. Trends to globalization and freer markets enhance our trading and tourism opportunities and is increasing the mobility and availability of capital required for investment. Conversely, globalization exposes Alberta to more competition andincreases our dependency on the strength of our major trading partners and exchange rate fluctuations. Alberta faces strong competition as a place to conduct business successfully. A coordinated and strategic approach is required across governments and the private sector tocapitalize on growth opportunities, meet the competition and build our capacity to buffer the shocks from economic factors outside our control. Government contributes by maintaining an environment that retains private sector confidence in Alberta as an attractive place to invest and do business. We call this environment the Alberta Advantage. It includes competitive tax and regulatory policies, an abundance of natural resources, a skilled, highly educated and innovative workforce, soundfiscal management, key infrastructure, and an unsurpassed quality of life. The Alberta Advantage ensures that our business community enjoys a stable business and social environment. This stability allows businesses to capitalize on the opportunities of arapidly changing, global economy and to contribute to the continued development of Alberta's communities and the well-being of Albertans and their families. The private sector brings an entrepreneurial and competitive spirit to the Alberta Advantage. It identifiesopportunities; applies time, money and resources; takes risk and creates jobs. It also helps to identify short and long-term responses required in an ever-changing commercial world. Focusing on the province's Prosperity core business, Alberta Economic Development (AED) encourages the province's business community to find new opportunities to expand business and create jobs by striving to ensure that Alberta is, and is known to be, the best place in the world to live and do business . The Department leads government's strategic marketing of Alberta as a credible player on the world economic stage. By doing so we contribute to increasing the trade and investment required to grow our economy and to the development and well-being of all Albertans. Alberta Economic Development develops, implements and supports targeted strategies within selected sectors and markets to increase exports, enhance competitiveness, and attract visitors, investment and businesses to the province. We also coordinate a strategic economicplanning framework with the Alberta Economic Development Authority (AEDA), the private sector and across other departments and governments to identify barriers to economic growth and build effective solutions that enhance the Alberta Advantage. Key to theperformance of these businesses is the development and sharing of strategic market, trade, economic intelligence and business information, as well as the ongoing review, benchmarking and promotion of the Alberta Advantage.79 ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT BUSINESS PLAN 2000-03The Ministry of Economic Development works closely with the Alberta Economic Development Authority, the Strategic Tourism Marketing Council, and the Travel Alberta Secretariat. The Alberta Economic Development Authority, which is comprised of 10 committees with over 80 volunteers from the private sector, acts as a high level policy advisory group to the government concerning key economic development and industry competitiveness issues. This unique relationship with the private sector ensures Economic Development's goals areachieved in partnership with business and industry. The Strategic Tourism Marketing Council, made up of 14 volunteers from the tourism industry and three members from the provincial government, establishes the strategictourism marketing plan. The Council is a cooperative effort between government and the private sector to maximize the effectiveness of investments made in increasing tourism within Alberta. The Travel Alberta Secretariat consists of a small group of marketing professionals that provide assistance to the Council and are responsible for implementing and coordinating the strategic marketing plan. VISION Alberta is the best place in the world to live and do business. MISSION The Department's mission is to promote Alberta's continuing prosperity. VALUES Alberta Economic Development builds strong teams, partnerships, and alliances with Alberta businesses and communities in coordinating market development, investment attraction, and tourism. We provide competitive intelligence and business solutions to Alberta businesses. We value service and results orientation, accountability, and creativity in ouremployees. We respect each employee's skills and expertise, and encourage the sharing of knowledge among all colleagues to increase individual experience, competitive intelligence, and technical capabilities. Our future lies in capturing new ideas and work processes andthrough the promotion of best practices we help Alberta businesses successfully compete in the global marketplace.ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT BUSINESS PLAN 2000-03 80CORE BUSINESSES We work to achieve our mission across the province by concentrating on the following three core businesses: Core Business 1: Strategic Leadership for Economic Development Policy and Planning - Provide strategic leadership for Alberta's economic development.

Two levels of performance measures have been identified: industry level (outcome indicators) and marketing program level (output indicators). We have appropriate performance measures at the industry level, including tourism revenue and Alberta's market share. However, we need to develop performance measures at the marketing program level. In the 2000-01 fiscal year we will implement performancemeasurement processes for assessment of the impacts of the tourism marketing programs (cause and effect). This will be instrumental in improving tourism marketing programs and will indicate what works and what does not work and/or needs improvements. OUTCOME INDICATORS: 1. Tourism Industry Revenue - The annual value of all tourism industry revenues in Alberta. This includes expenditures made in Alberta by visitors from overseas, the United States, and other Canadianprovinces, and by residents of Alberta.

AIR QUALITY INDEX (SUPPORTS GOALS 1 AND 4) The Air Quality Index provides an indication of the quality of air in Alberta throughout theyear at selected locations in the province, including Edmonton, Calgary, Fort Saskatchewanand Fort McMurray. The measure reports the number of days in the year during which air is rated good, fair, poor or very poor using the guidelines established by Alberta's Environmental Protection and Enhancement Act and the National Air Quality Objectives . Specific parameters considered in this measure include carbon monoxide, ozone, dust and smoke, nitrogen dioxide and sulphur dioxide. The target is to maintain air quality levels which are considered good or fair at all times.

Alberta's Surface Water Quality Index assesses water quality in major rivers, allowing a comparison of sites upstream and downstream of developed areas. Environment and Agriculture, Food and RuralDevelopment have incorporated recent advances in an improved index. The target of bringing water quality downstream of developed areas in line with upstream conditions will be unchanged. Industrial approvals issued by the Ministry have been structured to include a requirement to monitor groundwater. Appropriate measures will be selected to measure the protection of groundwater from industrial pollution. A proposed target is to have all industrial sites meettheir required performance objectives, or to have a risk management plan in place. Charts for these two new measures are in preparation. REDUCTION OF MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE TO LANDFILLS AND HAZARDOUS WASTE REDUCTION (SUPPORTS GOALS 1, 4, AND 6) Since 1995, the amount of material going to landfills has increased as a result of greater economic activity and associated construction, renovation and demolition. A reduction target of 50% of 1988 levels by the year 2000 has been reassessed. A more realistic target of\"continuous reduction of municipal solid waste going to landfills on a per capita basis\" has been adopted. The Hazardous Waste Reduction performance measure is based on the ratio of the amount of hazardous waste recycled to the total amount of hazardous waste generated in Alberta. The target is to increase the percentage of hazardous waste recycled in Alberta.

Nelson, Minister of Government Services February 1, 2000GOVERNMENT SERVICES BUSINESS PLAN 2000-03 128INTRODUCTION Alberta Government Services (AGS) is a new Ministry, established in May 1999 to better meet Albertans' growing expectations for more flexible and convenient access to government. The Ministry will focus on the development of a \"gateway\" to government that will affect every Albertan. This \"gateway\" represents a fundamental change in how governmentinteracts with the public and private sector; a common, secure portal will allow individuals and businesses to interact with government. Key business and consumer competencies and activities have been merged into the Ministry to form the nucleus for the \"gateway\"initiative. In addition to initiating a \"gateway\", the Ministry's current activities touch the lives of every Albertan through leading-edge programs for land titles, motor vehicles, corporate/personalproperty registration, vital event registrations and consumer services. AGS' strong emphasis on customer service is an integral part to the success of the Ministry. Alberta Government Services is also responsible for the Regulatory Review Secretariat. The mandate of the Regulatory Review Secretariat is established by Executive Council and reflects the government wide initiative to reduce, simplify or eliminate regulations. During its first three-year planning period, AGS will build on its achievements in implementing award-winning, innovative service delivery and regulatory initiatives with a focus on: \u007f ensuring an informed, fair and competitive marketplace; and \u007f increasing the quality, accessibility and efficiency of registration, licensing and information services. The Ministry will also actively explore partnering opportunities with other government departments and levels of government, building on our core businesses to establish acomprehensive access point - or \"gateway\" - to a wide array of government programs and services. MINISTRY CHALLENGES The Ministry's business plan has been prepared within the context of a number of evolvingservice demands and technological issues and opportunities. These include the following: \u007f the need for all government departments to embrace service excellence supported by a \"gateway\" access to a broad range of information, products and services for Albertans; \u007f the increasing demands on registration, licensing, and information products and services, driven by the on-going economic growth of the province and continued pressures toaccommodate the increasing service desires of Albertans; \u007f the accelerated development of new Internet, call-centre, database, and computer technologies that can improve service delivery and increase efficiencies but which posechallenges in terms of regulation, enforcement, cross-jurisdictional consultation, and consumer and privacy protection; \u007f the increasing opportunities for establishing partnerships with the private sector to improve service delivery and voluntary or self-regulation, raise marketplace standards, and increase consumer awareness;129 GOVERNMENT SERVICES BUSINESS PLAN 2000-03\u007f rising public expectations regarding service quality, convenience and accessibility, including self-service options with respect to some registry functions; \u007f ongoing consumer issues, for example in the areas of home renovations and landlord/ tenant relationships, and new issues arising from deregulation, the growth of electroniccommerce, and an increasingly complex and diverse marketplace; \u007f the demands induced by marketplace globalization to share information and work cooperatively with other provinces and jurisdictions in both the consumer protection andregistries areas; and \u007f the need to respect both the right to access government records and the protection of privacy in the execution of the Ministry's activities. The challenges implied in these market and technological changes are reflected in the Ministry's business plan. VISION Connecting Albertans - A new gateway to government. MISSION Service excellence is the focus for delivery of services to Albertans. Alberta Government Services partners with governments, stakeholders, and businesses to: \u007f provide a secure, high-quality, and innovative gateway to a wide range of government services, including consumer information, registration, licensing, and other government services; \u007f facilitate, support, and, where mandated by legislation, regulate and strictly enforce high standards of consumer protection and business practice; and \u007f support the Regulatory Review Secretariat in its mandate to reduce regulatory red tape and complexity throughout government. CLIENTS AND STAKEHOLDERS The Ministry's primary clients include individual consumers and businesses in Alberta.However, AGS also works closely with other departments, levels of government, lawenforcement agencies, and business and non-profit organizations in exploring ways to improve service delivery, increase fairness and safety in the marketplace, and improve the province's regulatory framework. CORE BUSINESSES Both of the Ministry's core businesses support the key businesses of the Alberta government;People and Prosperity : \u007f Services to consumers, which include various registration and licensing services and an array of information services relating to consumer, corporate, and government matters.GOVERNMENT SERVICES BUSINESS PLAN 2000-03 130In addition to enhancing and expanding existing services, the Ministry will develop innovative new programs in collaboration with other departments and levels of government toward the development of a new gateway to government services. Service excellence will continue to be the focus of delivery of services to Albertans. \u007f Regulatory, monitoring, and compliance functions, which ensure that an appropriate legislative and regulatory framework supports the Alberta marketplace, and that the mechanisms are in place to ensure effective regulatory compliance and enforcement. The schematic below provides a visual picture of the structure and inter-relationships of the Ministry's activities. The key focus of this business plan is on service excellence.

Jonson, Minister of Health and Wellness February 2, 2000HEALTH AND WELLNESS BUSINESS PLAN 2000-03 138INTRODUCTION The Ministry of Health and Wellness is pleased to present our Business Plan for the three year period ending March 31, 2003. Business planning is a key management and leadership activity of the Ministry, both within the context of government as well as the health system in Alberta. This business plan is a record of what changes and improvements are anticipatedin the three years ahead, rather than an inventory of all of the activities essential to the operation of a provincial ministry and a public health system. The Ministry comprises the Department of Health and Wellness and three organizations with a provincial mandate: Alberta Alcohol and Drug Abuse Commission (AADAC) Persons with Developmental Disabilities Provincial Board (PDD)Premier's Council on the Status of Persons with Disabilities The mission of each of these organizations is defined on pages 149 and 150. These organizations report to the Minister of Health and Wellness and prepare, within the contextof the Ministry's Business Plan, their own Business Plans. The financial information for the department and the member organizations is consolidated in the attached income statement. This Plan proposes a vision for the provincial health system (as schematically represented below), and acknowledges some key challenges and issues from the Ministry's perspective. From this vision, goals and strategic directions emerge which can serve to inform dialogue among the public and stakeholders in search of a shared, collaboratively derived vision forthe system. HEALTH SYSTEM STAKEHOLDERS MINISTRY (Business Plan) (includes consumers/citizens) (Alberta Health and Wellness) DEPARTMENT AADAC, PDD, Premier's Council The Ministry's two core businesses, four goals and related objectives and strategies are written to encompass the activities of the department as well as the three provincially mandated organizations that comprise the Ministry. More detailed information about thestrategies for each of the member organizations is found in their Business Plan. The 2000-01 Annual Report for Alberta Health and Wellness will report the progress made on the commitments contained in the Business Plan. For reference purposes, a detailed description of how the health system in Alberta works today is contained in a separate publication entitled \"Health Care '99 - A Guide to Health Care in Alberta\" (July '99).139 HEALTH AND WELLNESS BUSINESS PLAN 2000-03VISION The Government of Alberta's vision for the province is \"A vibrant and prosperous province where Albertans enjoy a superior quality of life and are confident about the future for themselves and their children\". This broader vision is reflected in the slogan: \"Healthy Albertans in a healthy Alberta\". In this context, the vision of Alberta Health and Wellness is \"Citizens of a healthy Alberta achieve optimal health and well-being\". In acknowledgement that the determinants of the health and well-being of a population include factors such as education, employment, income and the environment, this vision is comprised of two distinct but interwoven dimensions: \u007f Albertans are able and encouraged to realize their full health potential in a safe environment, with adequate income, housing, nutrition and education, and to play avalued role in family, work and their community, and \u007f Albertans have equitable access to affordable and appropriate health and wellness services of high quality. The achievement of this vision requires individuals to take responsibility for health in their communities, in collaboration not only with the Ministry and providers of health services, but with a wide variety of parties including other Ministries, other levels of government andthe private sector. ISSUES AND CHALLENGES Publicly funded health services are organized and delivered to meet the priority needs ofAlbertans. But those needs, and the ways in which they can be best met, keep changing andso the system is challenged to adapt. The major forces of change are: \u007f Demographics \u007f Alberta's population is increasing and aging.\u007f As a consequence of age, both chronic disease and dependency are more prevalent and so demands on the health system and on informal caregivers continue to increase. \u007f As the provider population ages, skill shortages will occur in key health professions. \u007f Technology \u007f Advancements change our perceptions about what services can or should be delivered to whom and how. They result in new procedures (e.g., laporoscopic surgery), new drugs (e.g., for HIV, for migraine), new diagnostic (e.g., MRI) and treatment equipment (e.g., lasers), improved communication (e.g., Telehealth), etc. \u007f With these advancements come new costs (acquisitions, financing, training).HEALTH AND WELLNESS BUSINESS PLAN 2000-03 140\u007f Rising expectations in a knowledge society \u007f Albertans are well educated and will increasingly want to be informed about the choices and decisions they can make about their health and wellness. \u007f The new high profile technology improves the capacity to meet needs and raises public expectations for access to supports and services. \u007f Realigning priorities and reallocating resources are a constant challenge. \u007f Sustainability \u007f The increasing costs of drugs and technology, combined with salaries and utilization, cause the cost of the system to continue to rise significantly, and faster than thecombined effects of population growth and inflation. \u007f Restructuring provides an opportunity for greater operational efficiency but further reforms are necessary to keep costs within the capacity of public funding whileensuring accessibility, quality and accountability. MISSION AND CORE BUSINESSES Within the context of the Government's Business Plan and the vision for health, the Mission of the Ministry is... \"...to maintain and improve the health of Albertans by leading and working collaboratively with citizens and stakeholders.\" Across the health system, collaboration with citizens and stakeholders is essential for intended outcomes to be realized. In that regard, the feedback from the Health Summit hasbeen most instructive in the preparation of this plan. Within government, interdepartmental collaboration is a key to the achievement of this mission. The Ministry of Health and Wellness works with many other Ministries to address issues which influence health andhealth services delivery. To achieve our mission, the Ministry engages in two Core Businesses: \u007flead and support a system for the delivery of quality health services For Albertans who are fragile and/or ill, or who may need diagnosis, treatment or support, a system of quality health services is in place to meet their needs. While the responsibility for delivering those services rests with health authorities, agencies and individual practitioners, the Ministry is required to demonstrate leadership in settingdirection, policy and provincial standards which ensure quality services. Key Ministry roles are to set priorities based on health needs, determine the scope of financial, capital and human resources required, and measure/report on the performance of the system. \u007fencourage and support healthy living A primary focus of the health system is to support and encourage the well-being and health of Albertans, not just to diagnose and treat the ill and injured. Health promotion and protection programs, disease and injury prevention programs, along with enhancedsupports for persons with disabilities, address risks to health where knowledge or early intervention can make a major difference. Through health authorities and provincial141 HEALTH AND WELLNESS BUSINESS PLAN 2000-03agencies, programs for the promotion of well-being, as well as the prevention of disease and injury, enable Albertans to make informed decisions about their health. In acknowledgement of the wide array of factors that have an impact on health, the Ministry is engaged in inter-ministerial initiatives to effectively address challenges to the healthand well-being of the population. These two core businesses require the following function s: \u007f communicating and consulting with the public and stakeholders \u007f gathering, managing and sharing information and knowledge \u007f developing and implementing policy and strategies \u007f recommending direction and priorities\u007f setting standards \u007f monitoring, measuring, reporting on and improving performance \u007f providing and encouraging leadership\u007f encouraging and facilitating joint planning and action \u007f acquiring and allocating resources \u007f registering eligible Albertans and providers, and processing provider claims\u007f providing public health expertise and selected direct services \u007f advocating for health and wellness To succeed in our mission, the Ministry commits to key values and principles : \u007f consistency with the five principles of the Canada Health Act: \u007f accessibility - medically necessary services are available without user fees, extra-billing or other barriers to reasonable access; \u007f comprehensiveness - all medically necessary physician and hospital services are insured; \u007f portability - Canadians are covered for insured services received in another province;\u007f public administration - insurance plan is operated on a non-profit basis by a public authority; and \u007f universality - all Canadians are entitled to public health insurance for medically necessary hospital and physician services. \u007f Alberta's health system demonstrates excellence - high standards and best practices achieved through research, education and information \u007f Alberta's health system provides for equitable access by all Albertans to a comprehensive range of integrated health services \u007f Alberta's health system provides quality services and effective outcomes\u007f Alberta's health system builds on shared responsibility and decision-making among users, providers and organizers \u007f Alberta's health system ensures accountability at all levels for outcomes\u007f Alberta's health system is cost-effective, as well as sustainable in the long termHEALTH AND WELLNESS BUSINESS PLAN 2000-03 142GOALS, OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGIES Ministry goals and objectives under the two core businesses are shown below. Strategies for each of the goals and objectives are outlined in the tables that follow.

VISION STATEMENT A fair and equitable labour relations climate in Alberta. MISSION STATEMENT The mission of the Alberta Labour Relations Board is to support and advance the principles of Alberta's labour relations laws by: 1. educating the labour relations community and the public of their statutory rights and obligations; 2. developing policies and processes that will assist the parties to prevent disputes or resolve their differences over these rights and obligations without resort to litigation; and 3. providing timely, appropriate, impartial resolution of those differences. CORE ACTIVITIES The Board's core activities arise from the responsibilities placed on it by the labour relations legislation it oversees. These activities are: \u007f the investigation, processing, and determination of applications made to the Board by parties in Alberta's collective bargaining regime; \u007f the formal adjudication of issues arising out of the application/complaint process;\u007f the informal mediation of differences in attempts to limit the need for formal adjudication and help build mutually beneficial relationships between parties; \u007f the education of Alberta's labour community in the interpretation of Alberta's labour relations legislation and the Board's rules, policies and procedures; and \u007f the development of formal and informal consultative processes with the province's labour relations community to ensure that Board policies and procedures are sensitive to thecurrent realities in the community.HUMAN RESOURCES AND EMPLOYMENT BUSINESS PLAN 2000-03 166GOALS AND STRATEGIES GOAL 1 TO PROVIDE TIMELY, EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT SERVICES TO THE ALBERTA LABOUR RELATIONS COMMUNITY It is important from a labour relations perspective that all matters brought before the Board be dealt with as quickly as possible to ensure these situations don't grow into larger, more complicated issues. Strategies: a. Provide communications that are clear, timely and precise to ensure the parties understand the procedures and the issues involved. b. Investigate applications in a timely and accurate manner to ensure early resolution of differences. c. Ensure that all Board publications and communications are current and readily available to Alberta's labour relations community (Information Bulletins, Guide to Alberta Labour Relations Laws, Board Decisions, annual reports, forms, web-site, and other materials.) d.

OUR MANDATE Alberta Infrastructure is a multi-faceted organization responsible for infrastructure owned or supported by the Alberta government. Its key responsibilities are to: \u007f ensure the safety of those travelling on Alberta's roadways through the provision of traffic safety education, awareness and enforcement programs; \u007f provide safe and effective highways and support municipalities in the development and rehabilitation of local roads and bridges; \u007f manage the development of seniors' lodges, learning, health care and water management facilities; and \u007f plan, construct, operate and maintain cultural/historical, correctional, and other government facilities. CORE BUSINESSES \u007f improve road, driver and vehicle safety by delivering traffic safety education strategies; monitoring motor transport compliance with regulations; monitoring the handling and transport of dangerous goods; administering driver education and training programs; managing driver records and problem drivers; and implementing impaired drivingprograms; \u007f provide government facilities and road infrastructure through planning, design, construction, rehabilitation, operation, maintenance, and land management; \u007f through innovative partnerships, support the provision of infrastructure to meet the overall needs of Albertans, including local roads, health care, learning, and community service facilities and seniors' lodges; \u007f manage central services to all government departments, such as accommodation requirements, air transportation services, executive and government fleet operations, procurement, buildings, property acquisition and disposal; and \u007f influence national and international policy in roads, rail, air, passenger, ports/marine, and border crossing services, as well as represent Alberta's interests in internal and external trade agreements as they impact government procurement and transportation. GOALS AND STRATEGIES The following section represents the goals, strategies and performance measures used byAlberta Infrastructure to strategically plan for the 2000-01 to 2002-03 period. These goalssupport the goals and strategies outlined in the Government's Business Plan, particularly those related to the core business of Prosperity. Our goals are numbered 1 to 7, and the major strategies (in bold) and supporting information are noted below each goal. Due to the May 1999 government reorganization, a number of new performance measures are under development for inclusion in future business plans.171 INFRASTRUCTURE BUSINESS PLAN 2000-03The 1999-2002 Restated Business Plan and income statement reflect the additional funding allocations for transportation infrastructure as recommended by the Premier's Task Force on Infrastructure in August, 1998. Further recommendations of the Premier's Task Force were released on September 7, 1999, calling for funding to be increased by an estimated $925million over a three-year term commencing in 2000-01. The task force also recommended the transfer of responsibility from the municipalities to the province for secondary highways, as well as key trade corridors through some cities. The implementation of theserecommendations is reflected in the 2000-03 business plan. GOAL 1: IMPROVE TRANSPORTATION SAFETY Transportation safety involves virtually every Albertan, from drivers and pedestrians and themotor carrier industry to law enforcement and governments at every level. Throughnumerous education, information and compliance initiatives, Alberta Infrastructure will continue its efforts to make Alberta's roads as safe as possible. Improve road user behaviour through cost-effective education, information and compliance programs, and increased community participation. \u007f In consultation with stakeholders, the Traffic Safety Initiative will continue, focusing on generating a stronger awareness that all Albertans have a role to play in traffic safety;ensuring access to traffic safety information; improving traffic management, vehicle safety and driver skills; and ensuring that effective enforcement tools are in place. \u007f Regulations will be streamlined and consolidated under the new Traffic Safety Act , including revised Rules of the Road, Equipment Standards, and enhanced strategies to deal with impaired driving problems. Stakeholders will also be consulted extensively on these initiatives. \u007f We will continue to work with the motor carrier industry and other stakeholders on new programs such as the Professional Driver Training Initiative being developed by the Transportation Training and Development Company. The Partners in ComplianceProgram, which allows motor carriers with exemplary safety performance records to self- regulate, will continue in Alberta and efforts will be made to encourage the implementation of the program in other jurisdictions. In addition, inspection audits ofthe motor carrier industry will continue, as well as the monitoring of the handling and transport of dangerous goods on roads or by railways under provincial jurisdiction. \u007f The new Railway Act will be proclaimed. The objective of the new Act and regulation is to provide for the safe operation of railways under provincial jurisdiction. PERFORMANCE MEASURES Traffic Safety Measure The ministry is currently developing a new measure which will report on the successes of one or more of the new traffic safety programs and initiatives. This measure will allow thedepartment to gauge the effectiveness of programs targeted at educating drivers and reducing impaired driving.INFRASTRUCTURE BUSINESS PLAN 2000-03 172Mechanical Safety of Commercial Vehicles This measure is defined as the percentage of commercial vehicles that are rendered out-of- service using nationally recognized criteria (Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance) when inspected by department staff at roadside checks. Results Target Business Plan Targets 1998-99 1999-2000 2000-01 5.0% 5.0% 5.0% 5.0% Requiring Mechanic's Attention GOAL 2: ENHANCE INTEGRATED INFRASTRUCTURE PLANNING This goal addresses the department's strategy to improve infrastructure planning in order to make the most sustainable decisions regarding the management of both owned andsupported infrastructure. Facilitate the development and implementation of comprehensive infrastructure management and planning systems. \u007f As the lead ministry for the cross-government Capital Planning Initiative, Alberta Infrastructure will continue to work with other ministries in the development of a cross- government infrastructure priority rating system to ensure the most cost-effective andefficient use of infrastructure dollars. Ministry staff will also continue to work with regional health authorities, school boards, and other ministries in the development of long-term capital and rehabilitation plans for supported infrastructure. \u007f Using Internet-based software, Alberta Infrastructure will continue to develop the Integrated Health Facility Information System (IHFIS) in order to monitor the condition of publicly funded health facilities to support development and rehabilitation planning. \u007f The department will also continue to develop and implement the Infrastructure Management System (IMS). This system will enhance the ability of the ministry to prioritize construction, rehabilitation and maintenance on the highway network. \u007f The ministry will continue its long-term maintenance planning through cyclical evaluations of all owned facilities over 1,000 square metres (representing 80 per cent of all owned space), as well as owned facilities under 1,000 square metres, where warranted.Each facility will be re-evaluated every five years to ensure that the best possible information is available to support capital and maintenance planning. \u007f Alberta Infrastructure will consider the needs of persons with disabilities as a key criterion when planning and providing infrastructure, or designing and implementing programs. Ensure the efficient administration of infrastructure construction and maintenance contracts through the use of appropriate technology and innovative management. \u007f Partnering with industry stakeholders, Alberta Infrastructure will upgrade its electronic distribution process for all bid documents issued by the department to provide broader, easier, and quicker access to these documents. \u007f The ministry is committed to having 50 per cent of the 2001-02 fiscal year's primary and secondary highway construction and rehabilitation program available for tender by173 INFRASTRUCTURE BUSINESS PLAN 2000-03November 15, 2000, with an additional 25 per cent ready for tender by December 15, 2000. PERFORMANCE MEASURE Progress on the Collection of Facility Condition InformationThis measure indicates the percentage of ministry owned buildings over 1,000 square metres with condition information established. Facility condition is determined by field surveys completed by external consultants and department staff. Condition information is integral in making informed capital and maintenance planning decisions. Results Target Business Plan Targets 1998-99 1999-2000 2000-01 2001-02 2002-03 Percentage of Ministry-Owned Condition 59.9% 77.0% 89.0% 100.0% 100.0% Information Established NOTE: Once this measure reaches its final target in 2001-02, a new measure related to infrastructure planning will be developed. GOAL 3: WORK WITH PARTNERS TO PROVIDE QUALITY INFRASTRUCTURE One of the department's primary responsibilities is to ensure that Albertans have access to quality infrastructure. By working with our partners in the review, prioritization and implementation of infrastructure projects, we are striving to ensure basic infrastructure needs are met. Ensure the best possible quality educational facilities for Alberta students through effective and innovative planning and management of capital learning facility projects. \u007f In partnership with Alberta Learning, the ministry will continue to plan, evaluate and develop provincial capital plans, programs, policies and legislation for all learning facilities. Alberta Infrastructure will also continue to manage learning capital including utilization, acquisition, disposition, monitoring, and reporting of all learning facilities. \u007f Alberta Infrastructure will assist school boards and post-secondary institutions to function as autonomous corporate bodies in planning, building, operating, and maintaining learning facilities. \u007f The ministry will continue to implement the recommendations of the School Facilities Task Force in collaboration with school facilities stakeholder groups in order to fulfil the government's commitment to improve capital funding practices. \u007f The ministry will undertake a comprehensive review and establish a policy framework and guidelines for public/private partnership concepts for providing and sharing learning facilities. Provide funding and support for the construction and upgrading of health facilities and seniors' lodges. \u007f Alberta Infrastructure is responsible for major capital projects (total project costs greater than $1 million) and capital upgrading for hospitals, nursing homes, health units and other health care facilities. Those health care facilities projects that have been included inthis business plan were identified based on proposals from regional health authorities and provincial priorities established by the Ministries of Health and Wellness and Infrastructure.INFRASTRUCTURE BUSINESS PLAN 2000-03 174\u007f In partnership with Alberta Health and Wellness, the department will continue to develop and maintain a long-term provincial capital plan for health care facilities, based on facility condition assessments, regional health authority service planning and the Health Capital Projects Rating Scale approved by government. Alberta Infrastructure willwork with Alberta Health and Wellness to ensure that long-term regional capital plans are developed in concert with the regional health authorities by March 31, 2001. \u007f In partnership with Alberta Community Development, and in support of the government's Seniors Policy, continue the province-wide upgrading of seniors' lodges. The emphasis of this program is on life safety, building code, building envelope (i.e., roof, windows, exterior walls), mechanical and electrical upgrades, operating efficiencyissues and essential site work, which will extend the useful life of the lodges by 10 to 15 years. Upgrades to the 121 lodges that qualify for upgrading under the program will be completed by 2003. \u007f Infrastructure will also continue to work on projects on behalf of the lodge foundations that are outside the scope of the Lodge Upgrading Program, including the addition of resident units and the expansion of existing units to provide more space. Under thisarrangement, Infrastructure budgets for and manages this additional work and the lodge foundations reimburse the government for the costs. Implement the recommendations of the Premier's Task Force on Infrastructure. \u007f In response to municipalities' concerns and recommendations of the Premier's Task Force on Infrastructure, the province will assume responsibility for the cost of construction,rehabilitation and maintenance of all secondary highways effective April 1, 2000. As a result of this transfer of responsibility, municipalities will enjoy significant savings, as they will no longer have to fund maintenance or 25 per cent of secondary highwayconstruction projects. These savings can be used to fund other priority municipal infrastructure. \u007f In September 1999, the Premier's Task Force on Infrastructure recommended that funding to Alberta's 14 cities and the urban areas of Sherwood Park and Fort McMurray be enhanced. Commencing April 1, 2000, funding to the cities of Edmonton and Calgary will be based on the equivalent of five cents per litre of on-road fuel deliveredwithin each city resulting in approximately $65 million being provided to Edmonton and $85 million to Calgary per year. Other cities will continue to receive basic funding of $60 per capita, per year and will also be eligible for supplemental funding on aproject-specific basis. \u007f As well, the province will assume responsibility for the construction and maintenance of key primary highways along major trade corridors through cities, including the DeerfootTrail in Calgary, Anthony Henday Drive in Edmonton, Highway 63 in Fort McMurray, Highway 1 in Medicine Hat, and the North-South Trade Corridor routes through Lethbridge and Grande Prairie. Continue to provide funding to support municipal transportation and water/wastewater infrastructure. \u007f Counties, municipal districts, special areas and M\u00e9tis Settlements are facing increased growth and traffic resulting from a prosperous economy. This growth has placed additional stress on local roads and bridges, and has resulted in the need for enhanced investment in order to protect the integrity of the overall system. By eliminating theburden of responsibility for secondary highways, rural municipalities will have more175 INFRASTRUCTURE BUSINESS PLAN 2000-03funds for local roads and bridges. Paving of access roads to provincial parks will also be eligible for cost-shared funding. \u007f As recommended by the Premier's Task Force, the Resource Roads Program will continue to assist rural municipalities and towns and villages in addressing the needs forinfrastructure resulting from increased resource development related traffic. \u007f The Streets Improvement Program (cost-shared funding for transportation projects in towns, villages and summer villages) will provide enhanced funding of an additional $30per capita, per year commencing April 1, 2000, bringing funding levels to approximately the same level as the grant funding being provided to the cities. Effective April 1, 2000, hamlets will be eligible for funding under this program. \u007f Funding for municipal water/wastewater facilities under the Alberta Municipal Water/ Wastewater Partnership will be increased from $19 million to $29 million, $25 million, and $21 million respectively in each of the three years of this business plan. Eligiblemunicipalities can access funding for the capital construction of municipal water supply and treatment, and wastewater treatment and disposal facilities to ensure residents have safe drinking water and the facilities meet environmental standards. Protect the integrity and effectiveness of water management infrastructure in partnership with Alberta Environment. \u007f In partnership with Alberta Environment, construction of the East Arrowwood Syphon Replacement and St. Mary Dam Spillway Replacement projects will be completed. Construction of the South Heart River Dam Spillway Replacement and the Little BowRiver projects will proceed, subject to obtaining the remaining regulatory approvals. Support of the government's Aboriginal Policy Initiative. \u007f Alberta Infrastructure will continue to explore opportunities to expand the involvement of Aboriginal peoples in providing labour, equipment and material resources for ministry projects undertaken in the vicinity of their lands. PERFORMANCE MEASURES Progress on Completion of Major Water Management Construction ProjectThis measure is based on the percentage of total estimated construction costs paid to contractors, reflecting construction progress on each project. Activities including design,land acquisition (where required) and obtaining regulatory approvals precede the construction phase of each project. Results Target Business Plan Targets Project 1998-99 Spillway Replacement 75.0% 95.0% 100.0% \u2014 \u2014 South Heart River Dam Project \u2014 0% 50.0% 100.0% \u2014 Little Bow River Project (subject to obtaining remaining required \u2014 0% 20.0% 55.0% 100.0% regulatory approvals)INFRASTRUCTURE BUSINESS PLAN 2000-03 176Seniors' Lodge Upgrading Projects Completed (Total 121) This measure is calculated by determining the number of seniors' lodges for which upgrading is complete.

These facilities require ongoing upgrading as a result of equipment deterioration, or capacity shortfalls dueto population or economic growth. Results Target Business Plan Targets 1998-99 1999-2000 97.5% GOAL 4: IMPROVE THE MANAGEMENT OF PROVINCIAL TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE The department strives to continually improve the management of transportation infrastructure to ensure optimal quality and value. Improve transportation infrastructure in response to current and anticipated increases in the movement of people and goods resulting from enhanced economic activitie s. \u007f On September 7, 1999, the Premier's Task Force on Infrastructure recommended that significant additional funding be added to the primary highways program effective April 1, 2000, to be used for upgrading of primary highways to alleviate safety and traffic congestion concerns. Protect the integrity of the highway infrastructure through the timely maintenance and rehabilitation of roads and bridges. \u007f Alberta Infrastructure will continue to ensure private sector contractors effectively maintain the primary highway system by ordering work, setting standards and monitoring contractor performance.

PERFORMANCE MEASURES/INDICATORS International and Intergovernmental Relations has several methods of measuring its performance, including the following: 1. Reports on department Performance (e.g., Annual Report, mission reports) 2. Client Satisfaction Surveys 3. Intermediate Outcomes4. Secondary Indicators 5. Polling data on the views of Albertans 1. REPORTS ON DEPARTMENT PERFORMANCE Because the department's outcomes are often long term, dependent on factors outside the control of the department, and are difficult to present as quantitative data, the departmentprovides a detailed narrative record of its achievements and activities. The Annual Report documents the department's accomplishments for each goal and provides a narrative outlining events and outcomes. It is the intention of the Ministry to include within future Annual Reports a summary of the Report of the Metis Settlements Appeal Tribunal and the Metis Settlements Transition Commission. Adding information from these two organizations for which the Ministry hasresponsibility will enable users of the Annual Report to obtain additional information about the Ministry's responsibilities and accomplishments.INTERNATIONAL AND INTERGOVERNMENTAL RELATIONS BUSINESS PLAN 2000-03 206Other assessments are also done at the conclusion of major conferences, trade negotiations or missions to assess how Alberta fared in achieving its objectives. 2. CLIENT SATISFACTION SURVEYS Another measure of outcomes for International and Intergovernmental Relations isstakeholder or client satisfaction. To achieve its goals, the department works closely withAlberta ministers and ministries, and other organizations in the province. Through periodic surveys, the department consults these clients for their evaluation of its contribution to advancing Alberta's priorities and positions. The 1999 Client Survey indicated thatgovernment clients consistently rate the department at a high level of satisfaction with the services provided. This was the third broad survey completed by the department. The earlier surveys, completed in 1995 and in 1997, indicated a level of satisfaction of close to 4 out of5. The 1999 survey results were similar, with a target level of 4 out of 5 achieved in virtually all areas of services provided. Client Surveys continue to be an important component of the department's mix of measurement tools. 3. MEASURING INTERMEDIATE OUTCOMES The department prepares status reports or contributes to reports on major projects. Since these projects are multi-year ones, the approach of preparing regular progress reports or measuring intermediate outcomes allows governments and taxpayers to keep track of theprogress of particularly complex, long-term issues. Examples of this approach are regular status reports that measure the implementation of the Agreement on Internal Trade and the progress of complaints and disputes under that agreement. Other examples are the regularProgress Reports to Premiers by the interprovincial Council on Social Policy Renewal, and communiqu\u00e9s from annual meetings of Premiers. The International and Intergovernmental Relations departmental website will include updates on preparations for and progress indomestic and international trade negotiations (e.g., WTO and the AIT). The website will also provide an opportunity for reaction and comments from the business community and the public. 4. SECONDARY INDICATORS The department reports on a number of secondary indicators that track macroeconomic and socio-demographic trends. While these are not direct measures of the department's performance, they do provide an indication of the environment in which the department isoperating. Trade statistics, for example, track how the province is faring in export performance. However, it must be emphasized that export performance cannot be attributed to any one factor. Rather it is the result of a number of interconnected factors. In some cases,exports increase because of fluctuations in the world price for commodities such as oil, gas or wheat, or in the value of the Canadian dollar. In other cases, Alberta's trade performance reflects the aggressiveness of the private sector in opening up new markets. Some of theincrease may be attributed to the efforts of the Government of Alberta to remove barriers to trade in key markets, or to the government's efforts to \"open doors\" in key foreign markets for Alberta businesses through targeted trade missions or by receiving foreign visitors. Aboriginal socio-demographic data are another useful secondary indicator. These trends provide valuable information on the needs of the Aboriginal people in Alberta. This207 INTERNATIONAL AND INTERGOVERNMENTAL RELATIONS BUSINESS PLAN 2000-03information assists provincial departments and agencies in developing policies, programs and services to meet the needs of Aboriginal people. 5. PUBLIC POLLING DATA An important measure of how the Alberta government is performing in the areas of bothinternational and intergovernmental relations is public polling data that measures thesatisfaction level of Albertans with the performance of the provincial government in these areas. The polling data does not relate directly to the performance of the department only, but tracks the performance of the government. However, the department does play animportant role in supporting the Premier and his cabinet colleagues in achieving these intergovernmental and Aboriginal goals. The polling data is based on a regular national opinion poll conducted by Environics Canada, surveying the views of Canadians regardingthe performance of their provincial and federal governments. This is reported in the Focus Canada Report. Alberta's target is to maintain the government's public approval rating in federal-provincial relations on a par with the average of four other provinces (British Columbia, Saskatchewan,Manitoba, and Ontario). These provinces are used as a comparator as they are the provinces closest to Alberta in terms of geography, history, economic base, social patterns and approaches to federalism. Alberta's intergovernmental approval rating in 1998 was 71 percent. The four province average was 50 per cent and the federal government rating was 39 per cent. A similar poll on Aboriginal relations taken in 1997 showed an Alberta approval rating of 51 per cent versus a four-province average of 32 per cent. No polling was conducted on this question in 1998, but the question has been reinstated by Environics for 1999. GOVERNMENT-WIDE GOALS Much of the Ministry's work relates to Goal 18 of the Government Business Plan: Alberta will work with other governments and maintain its strong position in Canad a. The Ministry is also developing government-wide measures relating to Aboriginal well-being and self- reliance, which would involve most other ministries. As well, the Ministry strategies contribute to the realization of the following government- wide goals: Goal 2: Our children will be well cared for, safe, successful at learning and healthy (IIR outcomes 2.2 and 3.2) Goal 6: Alberta will have a prosperous economy (IIR outcomes 1.1, 1.2, 2.4 and 3.2) Goal 7: Our workforce will be skilled and productive (IIR outcomes 1.2, 2.4 and 3.2)Goal 13: Alberta businesses will increase exports (IIR outcomes 1.1, 1.2 and 2.4)INTERNATIONAL AND INTERGOVERNMENTAL RELATIONS BUSINESS PLAN 2000-03 208Ministry Income Statement (thousands of dollars) Consolidated Net Operating Result (thousands of dollars) Comparable Comparable Comparable 1998-99 1999-2000 1999-2000 2000-01 2001-02 2002-03 Actu al Budget Forecast Target Target REVENUE Internal Government Transfers - 11,300 11,300 - - - Other Revenue 50 - 5 - - - MINISTRY REVENUE 50 11,300 11,305 - - - EXPENSE Program International Settlements Legislation MINISTRY EXPENSE 35,035 33,960 38,307 34,221 34,363 34,520 Gain (Loss) on Disposal of Capital Assets - - - - - - NET OPERATING RESULT (34,985) (22,660) 2002-03 Actual Budget Forecast Estimates Target Target Ministry Revenue 50 11,300 11,305 - - - Inter-ministry consolidation adjustments - (11,300) (11,300) - - - Consolidated Revenue 50 - 5 - - - Ministry Program Expense 35,035 33,960 38,307 34,221 34,363 34,520 Inter-ministry consolidation adjustments - Consolidated Program Expense 35,035 33,960 38,307 34,221 34,363 34,520 Gain (Loss) on Disposal of Capital Assets - - - - - - CONSOLIDATED NET OPERATING RESULT (34,985) (33,960) (38,302) (34,221) (34,363) BUSINESS PLAN 2000-03APPENDIX CROSS-GOVERNMENT INITIATIVES ABORIGINAL POLICY FRAMEWORK A proposed Aboriginal Policy Framework was approved by Cabinet in July 1999, for consultation with Aboriginal organizations, industry, local and federal governments and other interested Albertans. The proposed framework will set out the structure for Alberta government policies that address the needs of Aboriginal people. It consists of three goals: the Government of Alberta will 1) work with Aboriginal people to improve individual and community well-being and self-reliance; 2) manage natural resources for the benefit of all Albertans, in a way that takes the existing treaty and other constitutional rights of Aboriginal people into account; and 3) clarify its own roles and responsibilities with respect to Aboriginal people. The consultation process concluded on January 31, 2000. The proposed framework will be revised to reflect, where possible, the input during the consultation process. A revised framework will be submitted to Cabinet forapproval by April 2000. Implementation of the key commitments in the Aboriginal Policy Framework involves most Alberta government departments. As a result, Cabinet has decided to implement an Aboriginal Policy Initiative as one of the fourmajor cross-government initiatives for 2000 - 2001. This will also involve the adoption of a Government Business Planning Goal directed to Aboriginal well-being and economic development. FRAMEWORK FOR INTERNATIONAL STRATEGIES One of the other cross-government initiatives is the Framework for International Strategies. The Framework outlines Alberta's three cross-government core businesses in the international sphere as follows: \u007f Building International Relations \u007f Removing Trade and Investment Barriers\u007f Marketing Trade, Tourism, and Investment International and Intergovernmental Relations will ensure that the international policies and activities of Alberta departments are coordinated so that programs and strategies are consistent with the recently adopted Frameworkfor Alberta's International Strategies. The Framework will focus on the strategic international priorities for Alberta, and the specific role the Alberta government can play in pursuing these.211211211211211 JUSTICE BUSINESS PLAN 2000-03JusticeBUSINESS PLAN 2000-03 ACCOUNTABILITY STATEMENT This Business Plan for the three years commencing April 1, 2000 was prepared under my direction in accordance with the Government Accountability Act and the government's accounting policies. All of the government's policy decisions as at February 1, 2000 with material economic or fiscal implications of which I am aware have been considered in preparing the Business Plan. The Ministry's priorities outlined in the Business Plan were developed in the context of the government's business and fiscal plans. I am committed to achieving the planned results laid out in this Business Plan. [original signed] Dave Hancock, Q.C., Minister of Justice and Attorney General February 1, 2000JUSTICE BUSINESS PLAN 2000-03 212MISSION STATEMENT The Mission of Alberta Justice is to ensure equality and fairness in the administration of justice in Alberta. As a result of the Justice Summit, we are currently undertaking a review and development of our Ministry's vision, mission and core values. This will involve dialogue between Ministrystaff and the public and will be reflected in future business plans. Albertans want their homes and communities to be safe places in which to raise their families and to do business. Promoting safe communities in all our programs will remain as ourprimary objective in this planning period. OUR STARTING POINT: THE SUMMIT ON JUSTICE The 2000-03 business plan for Alberta Justice represents a watershed in the administration of justice in the province as it represents the Ministry's response to the Alberta Summit onJustice. In January 1999, the Alberta Summit on Justice brought together representativesfrom justice-related agencies, volunteer organizations, stakeholders and citizens-at-large toaddress issues of concern regarding the justice system in Alberta. The Summit on Justice wasconvened to help make Alberta's good justice system better. Of the 136 delegates whoattended the Summit, most were randomly selected from across the province based ondemographics such as gender, age, occupation and First Nation/Metis considerations.Others were representatives from sectors with an interest in justice issues. The Summit wasconvened to ask Albertans for recommendations that would promote public confidence inthe administration of justice. Stakeholders and the public welcomed the government addressing outstanding justice issues. The Final Report: Alberta Summit on Justice was prepared by an outside steering committee. The report can be found on the website http://www.gov.ab.ca/justicesummit/ (click on\"What's New\", then click on \"Response of the Government of Alberta\"). The reportidentified 25 key recommendations in eight theme areas that were sound, practical and,most of all, \"doable\". These themes are as follows: \u007f Improve public knowledge, education and awareness \u007f Simplify the justice system \u007f Increase sensitivity and cultural awareness\u007f Enhance community partnerships \u007f Increase the role of victims \u007f Clarify accountability\u007f Take action on previous studies and reports on justice \u007f Increase funding In May 1999, the government published a response to the recommendations, agreeing that virtually all recommendations in the report would be addressed in the immediate, short orlonger term. The Ministry has made a commitment to regularly report on the progress it makes towards addressing these recommendations. The Steering Committee for the Justice Summit consisting of members from the justice community, has been asked to continue on as a Justice Policy Advisory Committee. This213 JUSTICE BUSINESS PLAN 2000-03committee will monitor progress towards implementation of the Summit recommendations; provide linkages to all stakeholders in the formal justice system; and assist in continuing partnerships between Ministry, non-governmental organizations, the private sector, and communities. The Justice Policy Advisory Committee will also encourage non-governmental organizations, the private sector and communities to implement the recommendations of the Justice Summit which require broader action. This business plan has, as a primary focus, the implementation of the recommendations of the Summit on Justice. OUR PLANNING ENVIRONMENT In addition to the Summit on Justice, the Alberta Justice business plan has considered thefollowing environmental factors in setting out our strategic objectives for 2000-03: Social and Economic Change: Divorced, common-law and single-parent families have increased. Children are experiencing more parental separation and growing up in non- traditional families. These trends will continue to contribute to an increase in the number ofpeople accessing family courts. There is a growing population of immigrants in Canada who originate from all parts of the world. It is important that the justice system be available, understandable and moresensitive to cultural diversity.JUSTICE BUSINESS PLAN 2000-03 214Demographics: Canada's population is aging. Due to declining fertility rates, there is a decreasing proportion of young adults \"at risk\" of committing crime or being victims. Due to increased longevity, there is an increase in the proportion of elderly who are fearful of crime. Canada's Aboriginal population is growing twice as fast as the country's total population and it is also getting younger. In Alberta, Aboriginal people are over-represented in the prison population. Alberta Justice needs to rise to the challenge of delivering services to Aboriginalpeople that will support community development and reduce the rate of incarceration of Aboriginal offenders. Justice is a Shared Responsibility: Justice is a shared responsibility between the federal and provincial governments. While the provincial Legislature is responsible for the administration of justice, property and civil rights, the federal Parliament is responsible for criminal law and procedures, which includes Youth Justice, and the laws relating to divorce,immigration, bankruptcy and inter-provincial trade and commerce. The provincial and federal government must work together to provide Canadians a safe and secure country. The courts are constitutionally independent entities and the government has a responsibilityto provide the necessary resources for their effective administration. Public Confidence: Public confidence in the Ministry of Justice drops as the public's fear of crime increases. There is more widespread and immediate access to crime event informationthrough the media, which in turn increases the fear of crime. The Summit on Justice was established to address legitimate public concerns such as crime prevention and victims' rights, with a view to increase the public's confidence in the justice system. Accessibility to Justice Services: Accessibility to justice services entails shifting from a single court-based dispute resolution mechanism to a variety of alternate dispute resolution mechanisms. These will include mediation, alternative measures and restorative justicetechniques. These mechanisms can provide cost effective and timely resolution in appropriate cases. Technology and Globalization: Technology has facilitated the rapid movement of people, capital and information. While this has resulted in a global economy, it has also produced crime that is global in scope. The challenge for the Ministry will be to partner with national and international enforcement agencies to produce a credible response to global economicand organized crime. Accountability: Increasingly, Albertans are looking to the public sector to account for results. The performance measures against which our programs are judged provide anobjective assessment of the progress of the Ministry in achieving its goals. Programs must exemplify excellence in the level of service delivery, while maintaining the necessary oversight to ensure the public interest is respected in all aspects of the justice system. ALBERTA JUSTICE STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES FOR 2000-03 For the coming planning period, Alberta Justice will focus on a number of key strategicobjectives which will improve the delivery of our core businesses in a manner that honoursthe recommendations of the Summit on Justice. These strategic objectives include the following:215 JUSTICE BUSINESS PLAN 2000-03Support for Families: Family law reform has been recommended in a number of forums including: the MLA Review of the Maintenance Enforcement Program and Child Access; the Federal Report of the Special Joint Committee on Child Custody and Access; and the Justice Summit. These forums have recognized that the volume of family law cases beforethe courts has increased and court processes can be costly. In addition, different levels of courts have jurisdiction in the family law area. Access by Albertans to family law can be improved through a consolidation and streamlining of both the family law legislation andcourt processes. These laws are currently found within a variety of different statutes. As well, many of the current laws have not been reviewed for a number of years. Family law will be reviewed and innovative reforms proposed which will improve access by Albertans to family justice. Review and a multi-level consultation will take place in 2000- 01, with legislation coming forward in 2001-02. Justice will continue to work with the Ministry of Children's Services to ensure that the Maintenance Enforcement Program,family mediation services and other child focussed programs continue to provide children with timely and appropriate assistance. Support for Families is one of the principle means by which we will achieve our fifth goal, \"To improve access to civil and criminal justice\". Youth Justice Initiatives: The nature of the change to services for young offenders contemplated by the new Youth Criminal Justice Act , and the Summit's theme of placing more emphasis on diversion programs and restorative justice, will allow Alberta Justice to deliver youth and children's programs with an increased focus on greater cooperation and communication between partnering groups, including Aboriginal communities. AlbertaJustice will explore the use of Attendance Centres, an expanded Alternative Measures Program and an Intensive Support and Supervision Program as alternatives to traditional justice sanctions. Alberta Justice strongly supports government's actions in reconfiguring. Greater cooperation and communication in the delivery of youth and children's programs will be achieved through participation in joint initiatives aimed at early intervention, with AlbertaChildren's Services and community stakeholders. Over the longer term, this will reduce input into the formal youth and adult criminal justice system. Youth Justice Initiatives are one of the principle means by which we will achieve our first goal, \"To promote safe communities in Alberta\"; our second goal, \"To provide services to victims of crime and ensure victims have a more meaningful role in the criminal justice system\"; our fourth goal, \"To facilitate the rehabilitation of offenders\"; and our fifth goal,\"To improve access to civil and criminal justice\". Improving Our Courts: Through the Justice Summit, the citizens of Alberta have expressed strong views about the functioning of the courts and trials process. They are ofthe view that: \u007f the complexity of the present justice system results in court delays; \u007f victims should have a more meaningful role; and\u007f the system should move to a more restorative approach which would make offenders more directly accountable to the community and to the individuals victimized by the crime.JUSTICE BUSINESS PLAN 2000-03 216The anticipated outcome of this strategic objective is earlier case resolution and improved services, consistent with the constitutional obligations of the province to provide for the courts in Alberta. Resolution may include a restorative form of diversion, an alternative measure or an early guilty plea. This strategy will be accomplished in part by having experienced Crown Prosecutors at the earliest possible time: \u007f screen police reports to determine if there is a reasonable likelihood of conviction and if it is in the public interest to proceed with the prosecution; \u007f determine if an alternative measure or other restorative approach is appropriate; \u007f assess the appropriate resolution of cases that are to proceed in the court system;\u007f pursue an early guilty plea through discussions with the defense counsel; and \u007f reduce unnecessary witness attendance in court by pursuing admissions of fact and expanding the use of affidavit evidence. To ensure that victims have a more meaningful role in the early case disposition initiative and in the conduct of prosecutions generally, Crown Offices will establish specialized public assistance units. The units will provide information, referrals and assistance with victims' needs, including restitution and victim impact statements. Public confidence in the justice system also depends upon providing access to citizens for the resolution of civil disputes. The development of an early alternative dispute resolution program will result in improved citizen access to civil justice forums that are fair, equitableand efficient. Improving our courts is one of the principle means by which we will achieve our first goal, \"To promote safe communities in Alberta\"; our second goal, \"To provide services to victimsof crime and ensure victims have a more meaningful role in the criminal justice system\"; and our fifth goal, \"To improve access to civil and criminal justice\". Restorative Justice Approaches: \"Restorative justice\" encompasses attempts to rehabilitate offenders, heal victims, involve communities and be responsive to diversity. A restorative justice system can be a very powerful tool for resolving social tensions and ensuring that the operation of the justice system is well-aligned with community expectations. The Summiton Justice recognized that healing - of both the victim and the offender - and restoring the balance of society in a humane and fair way is an important attribute of our justice system. Justice systems must have respect for the diversity that reinforces our collective commitmentto equality. Alberta Justice will continue its emphasis on offender work service contribution to their communities, with over one million hours of offender labour provided annually to non-profitcommunity groups. The Ministry will continue to provide support to the 75 existing Youth Justice Committees, whose volunteer members assist the justice system in sanctioning criminal offenders. Support will be extended to communities interested in establishing newYouth Justice Committees. Alberta Justice will continue to emphasize that incarcerated offenders be engaged in structured work or program activities. Contingent on the capacity of the community, Alberta Justice will consider the transfer of community corrections program management to Aboriginal communities expressing an217 JUSTICE BUSINESS PLAN 2000-03interest and demonstrating a readiness. Also contingent on the capacity of the community is the transfer to community management of adult minimum-security camps. Involving the local communities in the delivery of these correctional programs will ensure that the justice system is well aligned with community expectations. In fulfillment of its commitment to implement the recommendations of the Summit, the department will be actively exploring restorative justice alternatives with a view to expanding existing or initiating new restorative justice initiatives. Accordingly, the Adult AlternativeMeasures Program will be reviewed and expanded where appropriate. Restorative Justice Approaches are some of the principle means by which we will achieve our first goal, \"To promote safe communities in Alberta\"; our second goal, \"To provide servicesto victims of crime and ensuring victims have a more meaningful role in the criminal justice system\"; our fourth goal, \"To facilitate the rehabilitation of offenders\"; and our fifth goal, \"To improve access to civil and criminal justice\". First Nation Policing and Prosecutions: It has been a long-term objective of Alberta Justice to enable First Nations police services to address community law and order concerns. In this respect the Summit has noted, and the Ministry agrees, that First Nations should ultimatelyprovide services to their communities that are comparable to other similar communities in the province. Alberta Justice proposes to promote culturally sensitive approaches to prosecutions by developing the mandate of native liaison prosecutors in the coming year. This will include enhancing existing aboriginal awareness programs and improving the access of these programs to staff involved in conducting prosecutions. First Nation Policing and Prosecutions is one of the principle means by which we will achieve our first goal, \"To promote safe communities in Alberta\" and our second goal, \"Toprovide services to victims of crime and ensuring victims have a more meaningful role in the criminal justice system.\" Enhanced Services for Victims: The Summit recommended that victims become more involved in all stages of the resolution of a criminal act. Where appropriate, and where the victim voluntarily participates, the restorative justice process will involve the offender and will provide the victim with an opportunity for closure and healing. To provide effectiveservices to victims of crime and to expand the role of the victim in the criminal justice system, Alberta Justice will complete a review of current legislation from a victim's perspective. This will be accomplished by evaluating the services provided under the Victims of Crime Act , and making appropriate recommendations for change. A new funding model for victim program grants will be reviewed to ensure it reflects Criminal Codes requirements. Guidelines for offender-pay restitution will also be developed. Enhanced involvement of victims in the criminal justice process is a principle means by which we will achieve our second goal, \"To provide services to victims of crime and ensure victims have a more meaningful role in the criminal justice system\" and our fourth goal, \"Tofacilitate the rehabilitation of offenders\". Crime Prevention and Policing: The Summit noted Albertans found it imperative that their communities be safe places to raise their families and do business. Crime prevention wasidentified as a necessary element of safe communities and reconfirmed as a critical core business of the Ministry. In the coming year the Ministry proposes to augment crimeJUSTICE BUSINESS PLAN 2000-03 218prevention initiatives by supporting the Federal DNA Identification Act . The Act will provide for the analysis and use of genetic material (DNA) to assist police in linking offenders to serious crimes. A status reporting form will be introduced to enhance the case management of the most serious and complex cases. The recommendation of the Summit on Justice that the recruitment and training of police officers reflect the cultural and social diversity of the communities they serve, will be addressed by working with police services to standardize recruitment, selection and trainingof police officers in the province. Alberta Justice will also conduct a review of the process for filing a complaint against the police in accordance with the Summit recommendation to increase community involvement in disciplinary decisions concerning inappropriate policebehaviour and in the resolution of complaints against the police. Our crime prevention and policing strategic objectives are the principle means by which we will achieve our first goal, \"To promote safe communities in Alberta\". CORPORATE STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES Alberta Justice has identified three ministry-wide corporate strategic objectives that will bepursued to successfully achieve our goals and improve the delivery of our core businesses. Leadership Development: Significant numbers of managers will be eligible to retire in the next three to five years. Alberta Justice will develop effective successors to assume their roles.The goal of the Leadership Development Strategy is to provide learning opportunities to assist employees in developing their leadership skills and abilities. Develop Integrated Information Systems: A key theme of the Summit on Justice was the need of partners in the system to better communicate with each other and find more effective ways of sharing information. The integrated justice initiative will provide the framework for the use of technology to achieve greater effectiveness and efficiency in justiceprograms within our available resources. In this initiative, Alberta Justice, the police, the judiciary, private law firms and other stakeholders will expand the current information sharing between the various organizationsinvolved in the administration of justice. The desired outcome is to break down the organizational \"silos\", develop common information architecture and reduce procedure duplication with the ultimate goal of increasing the effectiveness of the system. Improving Public Understanding and Knowledge about the Justice System: The Justice Summit repeatedly highlighted the need to improve communication with the public regarding the administration of justice. It recommended that greater efforts be made toensure that citizens understand how their justice system works, why decisions are made and how they are made by the various components of the system. This will entail the development of a communications strategy which will focus upon educating Albertans onvarious roles and responsibilities of the partners in the system and how they coordinate their activities to further the public interest. In this planning period, Alberta Justice will meet with stakeholders to determine how this pro-active communication strategy can be accomplished and the role each partner will play in this endeavour. In addition, an examination of options to augment public legal education and information will be undertaken through working more closely with public legaleducation and information agencies, Alberta Learning and the Alberta Law Foundation. A219 JUSTICE BUSINESS PLAN 2000-03multi-sectorial communications plan will be prepared outlining the education objectives of the justice community, and the respective responsibilities of our partners and our Ministry in developing and disseminating information about the administration of justice. CORE BUSINESSES Successful implementation of the Ministry's strategic objectives requires the coordinatedinteraction of our core business functions: policing; victims' services; legal services for vulnerable persons; corrections, prosecutions; courts; and legal services to government.Our core businesses must work together to support the achievement of our goals and be delivered in an effective, efficient and high quality manner. GOALS AND PERFORMANCE MEASURES GOAL 1: TO PROMOTE SAFE COMMUNITIES IN ALBERTA Albertans have told us that they want peaceful and orderly communities in which they canlive, work and raise families in safety and security without fear of crime or victimization. To this end, Alberta Justice is committed to promoting safe communities in Alberta.The strategic objectives we will pursue over the next three years to reach this goal include: augmenting existing crime prevention programs and reviewing police recruitment and training; exploring restorative justice alternatives; promoting culturally sensitive approachesto prosecution and enabling First Nations police services to address community law and order concerns; and delivering youth and children's programs through greater cooperation with our partnering groups, including Aboriginal communities. The success of these strategic objectives in achieving this goal will be measured by: Public Perception of Safety in the Home This measure is defined as the percentage of Albertans who feel \"very safe\" to \"somewhat safe\" in their own homes. The data will be obtained from a public survey. Public Perception of Safety in the Neighbourhood This measure is defined as the percentage of Albertans who feel \"very comfortable\" to \"somewhat comfortable\" walking alone in their ownneighbourhoods at night. The data will be obtained from a 220Victimization Rate This measure is defined as the percentage of surveyed Albertans who have reported being a victim of crime in the past year. It is a measure of publicsafety and is another way to assess how well the Ministry is promoting safe communities in Alberta. * This target will be based on the results of the national General Social Survey being conducted in 1999. Crime Rate This measure is defined as the total number of Criminal Code of Canada incidents per 100,000 population as reported by the police. This measureis intended to identify the risk of Albertans becoming a victim of crime. Although all Albertans and all government ministries have a role to play inreducing crime, this measure represents our Ministry's responsibility for dealing with crime and its consequences. * For 1998, the Canadian average was 8,102. National data for 1999 is not available at this time. Public Satisfaction with the Level of Policing This measure is defined as the percentage of Albertans who feel \"very satisfied\" to \"somewhatsatisfied\" with the level of policing in Alberta. The data will be obtained from a public survey. GOAL 2: TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO VICTIMS OF CRIME AND ENSURE VICTIMS HAVE A MORE MEANINGFUL ROLE IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICESYSTEM Recognizing the needs of the victim in the criminal justice system helps restore the balance of society in a humane and fair way and is an important goal of our justice system. AlbertaJustice is committed to providing effective services to victims of crime and expanding the role of the victim in the criminal justice system. The strategic objectives we will pursue over the next three years to reach this goal include: reviewing current legislation from a victim'sperspective; evaluating services provided under the Victims of Crime Act ; implementing a new funding model for victim program grants; reviewing the Victim Impact Statement Program to ensure it reflects Criminal Code requirements; and involving victims on a voluntary basis in restorative justice processes so that the goals of healing and closure can be achieved. The success of these strategic objectives in achieving this goal will be measured by:1996 8,901 1997 9,127 1998* 9,043 1999 Target 9,000 2000 Target Canadian average 2001 Target below Canadian Canadian average221 JUSTICE BUSINESS PLAN 2000-03Number of Alberta Community Initiatives that Work in Partnership with Alberta Justice There are numerous justice initiatives throughout the province that involve the participation of the community. These ongoing initiatives includeCitizen Advisory Committees; Youth Justice Committees; community-based Victim Services Units; First Nation police services; and Aboriginalcrime prevention programs. This measure represents the total number of community initiatives in partnership with Alberta Justice. Satisfaction Rate with Services Provided for Applicants Who Apply for Victim Financial Benefits The new Victims of Crime Act has changed the way services are provided to victims of crime. Victims are surveyed to assess their level of satisfaction withrespect to the services they received within the criminal justice system. This indicator represents overall satisfaction with services on a scale of one tofive, with five representing \"very helpful\". GOAL 3: TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO JUSTICE SERVICES FOR PERSONS IN NEED Families and the community are principally responsible for protecting the vulnerable, butcritical contributions are made by the justice system. Access to justice services for Albertans in need is provided through maintenance enforcement, public trustee services, victim assistance, and the support for legal aid. The success of these strategic objectives in achieving this goal will be measured by: The Amount Collected on Maintenance Enforcement Program Files The fundamental objective of the Program is to collect court ordered maintenance for creditors. Dollars collected per file is a reasonable indicator ofthe Program's effectiveness in this regard. This indicator will be maintained as a surrogate measure until data can be collected on the previous measure. Client Satisfaction with the Services of the Public Trustee's Office This measures client satisfaction with services provided by the Public Trustee's Office. It is defined as the percentage of \"satisfied\" and \"very satisfied\" clientele from a survey conducted by thePublic Trustee's Office. This measure will monitor how well the Public Trustee provides its services and is one measure of ensuring access.1996/97 177 1997/98 192 1998/99 222 1999/2000 225 3.81 1998/99 3.87 1999/2000 Target 3.95 2000-03 222Number of Eligible Persons Receiving Legal Aid Services Legal aid volume measures the demand for legal aid. It is defined as the number of eligible peoplereceiving legal aid services. GOAL 4: TO FACILITATE THE REHABILITATION OF OFFENDERS At times, members of our communities come into conflict with the criminal justice system. When an individual does engage in criminal activity, it is to the advantage of all Albertans that offenders are held accountable and are encouraged to become law abiding members ofsociety. While the onus for change rests with the individual, it is believed that the change process can be facilitated through providing offenders with assistance and opportunities that promote positive and productive behaviours. The strategic objectives we will pursue over thenext three years to reach this goal include: exploring restorative justice alternatives; reviewing and expanding the Adult Alternative Measures Program; emphasizing offender work service contributions to the community; and provision of support for Youth JusticeCommittees. The success of these strategic objectives in achieving this goal will be measured by: Per cent of Offenders Involved in Meaningful Activities This measures the percentage of incarcerated offenders involved in work, education and lifemanagement programs. While not all offenders are able to participate due to health reasons, court involvement, etc., these activities are important tohelp prepare offenders for a successful return to the community. Note: In 1998, the method of counting offenders involved in meaningful activities changed. The target for this measurewas previously set at 95%. In light of the newmethodology, however, a revised target has been employed.This new target recognizes that some individuals are notable to participate because they are in court, at meetingswith lawyers or other professionals or otherwiseunavailable. Number of Hours of Community Service Community service work is a program that allows offenders an opportunity to give something back to their communities and to learn positive work habits.Projects are completed for non-profit organizations, community groups, municipalities and government ministries. This measure reports on thecontribution to the community of activities in which offenders are involved.1998/99 86% 1999/2000 Target BUSINESS PLAN 2000-03GOAL 5: TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO CIVIL AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE The justice system is responsible for providing the infrastructure to resolve criminal and civil disputes. This includes the provision of court resources; scheduling mechanisms; prosecutorial services and appropriate dispute resolution mechanisms. Where appropriate, mediation, judicial dispute resolution and mini-trials are used as alternatives to thetraditional court process. The Ministry will develop ways to ensure those who need justice services can access them in a timely way that is also cost effective and fair. The strategic objectives we will pursue over the next three years to reach this goal include: implementinga provincial court strategy; changes in prosecution; and an increase in alternative dispute resolution initiatives. Alberta Justice will also be reviewing family law legislation and proposing reforms to improve access to family justice. The success of these strategic objectives in achieving this goal will be measured by: Median Elapsed Time from First to Last Appearance This measures the median elapsed time in days that it takes to process a case in Provincial Criminal Court from first to last appearance. The Ministry must ensure that there is access to the courts in areasonable amount of time. * Data for 1998/99 median elapsed time is not yet available. ** The 1997/98 national average was 84 days. National data for 1999 is not available at this time. GOAL 6: TO PROVIDE EFFECTIVE LEGAL SERVICES TO GOVERNMENT OF ALBERTA The government performs a number of roles as service provider, community partner and lawmaker. These roles involve relationships with individuals, families, communities,businesses and other governments. The administration of justice includes legal support to assist in establishing and maintaining positive and constructive relationships. Effective legal services reduce the potential for conflict involving the government and protect the interestsof the government when relationships are formed and when conflict arises. This goal is met through: the provision of legal advice to government; representation of client departments and Crown agents in litigation and other dispute resolution processes; and advice inlawmaking and drafting of policy and legislation. The success of these strategic objectives in achieving this goal will be measured by: Client Satisfaction with Legal ServicesThis measures the level of satisfaction that client ministries have with the legal services of Alberta Justice.1996/97 67 1997/98 76 1998/99* 1999/2000 2000-03 224CROSS-GOVERNMENT PARTNERSHIPS Alberta Justice is a partner with shared responsibilities within the government in many initiatives that seek to improve the quality of services to the public in areas not traditionally associated with the administration of justice. We will continue to participate in collaborative efforts that support government-wide initiatives, such as: Government Business Plan: Through our commitment to foster safe and secure communities and to administer justice effectively, we support the government's vision and mission. For example, our business plan has strategies in place which will support theAlberta Children's Initiative by emphasizing early intervention to reduce the numbers of young persons in conflict with the law. Corporate Human Resource Development Strategy: Alberta Justice has a number of initiatives in place to develop the human resource potential of the public service. These initiatives include providing leadership skills programs, mentoring programs to develop the next generation of public sector managers, and employee wellness programs. Alberta Corporate Services Centre Initiative: Alberta Justice will examine ways to improve efficiency, reduce costs and provide support for programs through a review of sharing services with other ministries in the area of financial and administrative services, human resourcesand information technology. We will be involved in the support of the design and implementation teams. Economic Development Strategy: Alberta Justice will collaborate with other government ministries to support our government's role in developing the economy of the province. We will provide quick access to fair courts and dispute resolution forums and effective police services so that Alberta remains a prosperous and safe place to do business and raise families. Aboriginal Policy Framework Initiative: Alberta Justice is committed to building on its strong relationship with First Nations, Metis and other Aboriginal people through the development of new forms of agreements, accords and understandings related to justiceissues. Consultations on the establishment of a First Nations Forum on Policing and Justice is an example of the Ministry's activities on this initiative. Municipal-Provincial Roles and Responsibilities: In 2000-2001, Alberta Justice and Alberta Municipal Affairs will lead a government-wide initiative to clarify the issues relating to the relationship between municipalities and the province. A proposed plan to help resolve outstanding issues will be developed in subsequent fiscal years. A major element of thisreview that is expected to be of mutual concern to the Ministry and municipalities is the provision of police services to Albertans.225 JUSTICE BUSINESS PLAN 2000-03Ministry Income Statement (thousands of dollars) Consolidated Net Operating Result (thousands of dollars) Comparable Comparable Comparable 1998-99 1999-2000 1999-2000 2000-01 2001-02 2002-03 Actu al Budget Forecast Estimates Target Target REVENUE Transfers from Government of Canada 25,832 23,534 26,625 29,410 28,406 29,233 Investment Income 509 50 Fees and Licences 27,589 Judicature Act 47 - - - - Victims of Crime Fund 10,720 6,748 9,000 9,590 9,830 9,930 Valuation 456,949 447,332 451,596 Gain (Loss) on Disposal of Capital Assets (16) - - - - - NET OPERATING RESULT (287,976) (303,129) 102,977 110,129 131,561 109,749 110,372 Inter-ministry consolidation adjustments Consolidated Revenue 112,239 102,977 Inter-ministry consolidation adjustments - - - - - - Consolidated Program Expense 400 ,199 406 ,106 412 ,558 456 ,949 447 ,332 451 ,596 Gain (Loss) on Disposal of Capital Assets (16) - - - - - CONSOLIDATED NET OPERATING RESULT (287,976) (303,129) (302,429) PLAN 2000-03 ACCOUNTABILITY STATEMENT This Business Plan for the three years commencing April 1, 2000 was prepared under my direction in accordance with the Government Accountability Act and the government's accounting policies.

Last year alone net interprovincial migration added 31,064 more people to Alberta's population. While this growth brings tremendous economic opportunity for Alberta and Alberta's businesses, it also increases demand for local services and municipalinfrastructure. Every person lives in a municipality; Albertans' lives are touched by the services and decisions made by their local governments. In the midst of the province's continued growth, Alberta Municipal Affairs will help to ensure Albertans live in safe and sustainable communities, are served by open, effective and accountable local governments, and have their privacy protected. It will do so through its four key business areas: Local Government Services, Safety Services, Disaster Services, andFreedom of Information and Protection of Privacy. This will support the Alberta Advantage; maintaining Alberta as the province of choice as the new millennium is ushered in. BUSINESS PLAN SETTING A number of current issues and evolving challenges confront the Ministry and will shape thenew three-year business plan: \u007f continued pressures on local services, facilities, and infrastructure caused by growth of the Alberta economy, changing demographics and environmental factors that affect local communities; \u007f the need to improve the standardization of the property assessment system to ensure efficiency, uniformity, and equity; \u007f the need to clarify and potentially redefine provincial-municipal relationships to improve service quality, efficiency, and accountability; \u007f the need to cooperatively address the challenges facing small municipalities; \u007f increasing financial pressures on municipalities;\u007f continued need to support and advise all public bodies, such as local government bodies and post-secondary institutions, to help them comply with the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act ; and \u007f the requirement for enhanced information systems to improve service efficiency, measurement, and quality.

For the core resources of oil and natural gas, an indicator of this balance is the portion of industry's annual net operating revenue that is paid to the Crown as royalty. 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 Estimate Three year moving average 25% 23% 22% 23% 22% 21% Source: Developed from information in Energy Update published by ARC Financial Corp. GOAL 1: REVENUE ASSURANCE Assessing and collecting all revenue due to the Crown from development of its resources is a primary responsibility of the Department. To provide assurance that revenue is complete, accurate and fairly valued, the Department monitors several key indicators through revenuereporting and historical audits. In addition, we target that no material weaknesses will be identified by the Auditor General in the annual review. Following improvements to our audit scope and revenue reporting in 2000 - 2001, integrated measures will be established tomonitor revenue. In the interim, the Department assesses the following early indicators, some of which may be replaced in future business plans. Natural gas revenue is assessed and collected in a timely manner \u007fTimely Invoices - Target: 100% of invoices are issued by the last day of the month. On or before the last day of the month, gas royalty invoices are issued to all royalty clients with production during the month. 1996 1997 1998 1999 January to July Invoices issued by month-end 100% 100% 100% 100% Source: Alberta Resource Development \u007fLate Filing - Target: The penalty structure is changing. This indicator will be monitored to establish a target. Penalties are assessed when a required filing is received after the due date. This indicator represents the proportion of documents subject to penalties. In November 1999, the penalty structure was revised to implement a variable, rather than a fixed, penalty that isbased on the due date, rather than the receipt date, of the document. 1998 1999 April to August Documents subject to penalties (average) under old penalty rules 5.4% 2.5% Source: Alberta Resource DevelopmentRESOURCE DEVELOPMENT BUSINESS PLAN 2000-03 258\u007fProvisional Assessments - Target: This is a new process that is being monitored to ensure consistency. To encourage accurate and timely volumetric reporting, provisional assessments are levied if filings are late or are not accurate. Assessment levels are an indication of the extent of gas royalty that is not reported accurately the first time. This is a new process and the Department monitors trends in this measure to ensure consistency. 1997 1998 1999 May to December January to July Provisional assessments 23.5% 17.7% 13.4% Source: Alberta Resource Development The Crown is receiving a fair market price for royalty crude oil \u007fCrude Oil Marketing - Target: The Crown receives fair market value for its product. The Crown's royalty on conventional crude oil is taken as product and since June 1996 has been sold through marketing agents. Payment received from the sale of this oil isrevenue to the Crown. Posted prices that refineries are willing to pay for crude oil are the accepted industry standard for fair market value. Comparing the posted prices to the equivalent price received by the Crown provides an indication of whether the Crown isreceiving fair market value for its product. Can$/m3Light Sweet Crude Light Sour Crude Heavy Crude Average 1999 Crown price $0.69 above $0.95 above $0.60 above January to July Edmonton postings Hardisty postings Hardisty postings Source: Alberta Resource Development GOAL 2: DEREGULATION OF ALBERTA'S ELECTRICITY INDUSTRY In 1998, the Electric Utilities Amendment Act (EUAA) was passed as a key step in deregulation. The Act introduced further industry structure and regulatory reforms designed to increase efficiency in the electricity industry. These reforms will increase the competitiveness of wholesale electricity markets and retail market s. \u007fPower Pool Participation - Target: Increase participation to 52 by 2001. The growth in power pool participation is an indicator of the success of implementing competition in Alberta's electricity market. 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2001 As of October 14 Number of power pool participants 22 33 38 40 45 52 Source: Power Pool of Alberta \u007fConsumer Awareness - Target to be established following an initial survey to determine the base level of consumer awareness of electricity deregulation. The level of public awareness of changes resulting from electricity deregulation will affect the ability of consumers to make an informed choice of their electrical supplier in Fall 2000. To provide consumers with information and education, the Department willundertake an information campaign in 2000. To measure consumer awareness, surveys259 RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT BUSINESS PLAN 2000-03will be conducted prior to and during the campaign. A target will be established after the initial survey, with reference to the experience of other jurisdictions. GOAL 3: NATURAL GAS PIPELINE CAPACITY TARGET: INCREASE NATURAL GAS PIPELINE CAPACITY To evaluate market access, the Department monitors instances when demand for throughput exceeds available pipeline capacity. In recent years, take-away pipeline capacity has been insufficient to meet demand, thereby reducing the market value of Albertans' natural gas resources. Available capacity increased in late 1998 with expansion of TransCanada Pipelines and Foothills/Northern Border Pipeline. The Alliance project willincrease capacity to 13.3 billion cubic feet per day (bcf/d) by the end of 2000. 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 As of August 1999 Utilization rate 93% 95% NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd. GOAL 3: SECONDARY PROCESSING TARGET: ENCOURAGE STEADY GROWTH BY INDUSTRY The volume of primary resources that undergo secondary processing in Alberta is an indication of the growth in Alberta's processing capability. Plant expansions and new projects are expected to increase synthetic crude oil production and ethane demand. \u007fBitumen upgrading in Alberta - volumes consumed in Alberta synthetic crude oil manufacturing, and the per cent of bitumen production upgraded to synthetic crude oil.

The Department is now developing key indicators that measure the incremental administrative cost associated with royalty reporting.RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT BUSINESS PLAN 2000-03 260GOAL 5: FOREST INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENT TARGET: INCREASE THE TIMBER CUT AND REDUCE THE GAP BETWEENTHE HARVEST AND THE ANNUAL ALLOWABLE CUT CAP. This measure has been adapted from a Ministry of Environment performance measure and will be evaluated as a measure for forest industry development. This measure compares the actual annual timber harvest with the approved annual allowable cut (AAC), which is the amount of timber that can be harvested on a sustainable basiswithin a defined planning area. The AAC, which is set by the province, identifies the opportunity for resource development. The target is to increase the timber cut and reduce the gap between the harvest and the AAC cap, ensuring sustainable timber resourcedevelopment.

A more efficient hearing process that substantially reduces delays in decisions will result in benefits to all stakeholders. Thisindicator measures our ability to improve application and hearing process timelines while continuing to provide a fair and responsible regulatory environment. 2000-2001 2001-20002 2002-2003 % of decisions issued in less than 90 days from the end of the hearing 90% 95% 100% FACILITATION OF INDUSTRY/LANDOWNER CONFLICTS TARGET: ASSIST INDUSTRY IN IMPROVING THE SATISFACTORY RESOLUTION OF OPERATIONAL COMPLIANCE COMPLAINTS RECEIVED BY FIELD SURVEILLANCE WITHRESPECT TO EXISTING FACILITIES 1999 2000-2001 2001-2002 2002-2003 % of incidents resolved to the satisfaction of the complainant 78% 80% 83% 85% TARGET: IMPROVE THE % OF OBJECTIONS RESOLVED, RELATED TO NEW FACILITY AND RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT APPLICATIONS (NON-ROUTINE APPLICATIONS),PRIOR TO HEARING Utilize staff from the EUB's Surveillance and Applications Branches to facilitate conflict resolution before a hearing is required. Activities will be directed towards developing win-win solutions and avoiding public hearings. During 2000 - 2001, the EUB will evaluate itscurrent success in order to establish achievable targets. Our initial expectation is that the263 RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT BUSINESS PLAN 2000-03resolution of 85% of objections related to new facility and resource development applications is possible by 2001 - 2002. APPLICATION TURNAROUND TIME TARGET: 3 - 3.5 CALENDAR DAYS (AVERAGE) FOR ROUTINE FACILITY APPLICATIONS Application turnaround time is an indicator of the efficiency of the EUB's application- handling processes. In 1997 and early 1998, a significant reduction in routine application turnaround times was achieved, and three- to four-day averages were maintained despiterecord activity levels. Statistics from the latter part of 1998 indicate that the targeted turnaround rate is being maintained. DEREGULATION OF ALBERTA'S ELECTRICITY INDUSTRY TARGET: COMPLETION OF ALL REGULATORY MILESTONES, WHICH HAVE BEEN SET BYTHE GOVERNMENT TO SUPPORT DEREGULATION TRANSITION PERCENTAGE OF SOLUTION GAS PRODUCTION CONSERVED TARGET: MORE THAN 90% Measures show the effectiveness of regulatory requirements and industry practices in achieving an appropriate degree of conservation of solution gas and environment protection by reducing flaring. In 1997, the solution gas conservation rate was 93.5%. IT STRATEGY TARGET: 100% OF BUSINESS DATA ELEMENTS CURRENTLY RESIDING IN THEMAINFRAME ENVIRONMENT WILL BE MIGRATED BY 2003 TO THE DATA WAREHOUSEON THE CLIENT/SERVER PLATFORM, MAKING ALL DATA ACCESSIBLE TO STAFF The EUB plans to put in place a data warehouse for EUB staff, industry and the public so that they can access production and facility data and the status of applications more easily and with state-of-the-art tools supporting their decision making processes. This datawarehouse will complement the Shared Information Registry expected to be put in place by the Volumetric Infrastructure and Petroleum Information Registry initiative sponsored by the Ministry and industry. This will minimize redundancy in the kind of volume data andin the systems querying the data. 1999-2000 2000-2001 65% 100% STAFF EXPERTISE RENEWAL TARGET: SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN REGRETTABLE STAFF TURNOVER ANDIMPLEMENTATION OF A LONG-TERM SUCCESSION PLAN Without appropriate staff expertise in place, fulfilment of EUB core business commitments will be impaired. The EUB lost 1,250 person-years of experience in 1997 and 1998. The goal is to bring regrettable turnover down each year to a target of not more than 50% of that experienced in 1997/98. (Regrettable turnover is defined as departure of staff that theorganization would prefer to retain.) This performance measure is designed to measure EUB staff ability to accomplish core business performance measures and depends on our ability to attain a competitive compensation strategy. 1998 and 1999 2000-2001 2001-2002 2002-2003 average Person years of regrettable turnover 625 500 400 300RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT BUSINESS PLAN 2000-03 264NORTHERN ALBERTA DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL BUSINESS PLAN MISSION Our mission is to advance northern development through regional initiatives in partnership with the private sector, community-based organizations, and other government agencies. The mandate of the Northern Alberta Development Council (NADC), as outlined in the Act of Legislature, is to \"investigate, monitor, evaluate, plan, and promote practical measures to foster and advance general development in northern Alberta, and to advise the government thereon.\" Our current focus is on advancing the development of the northern economy. Northern Alberta includes 60% of Alberta's land mass and has 10% of the province's population. It is resource rich, with 90% of Alberta's forests, all of Canada's oil sands development, nearly 40% of Alberta's conventional oil and gas activity, and 20% of Alberta'sagricultural land. The NADC reports to Cabinet through Honourable Mike Cardinal, Associate Minister of Forestry and MLA for Athabasca-Wabasca. Mr. Cardinal chairs the eight member Council,who all live and work in northern Alberta. Professional support is provided by a 12-member staff based in Peace River. VISION Northern Alberta has tremendous potential for economic growth, based on a strong agriculture sector and driven by energy, forestry, and tourism sector expansion. Our vision is to build on these opportunities to achieve a strong economy by training northerners and capturing local benefits from resource development, adding value to commodities, and byaddressing key northern issues and barriers to development. This will contribute to the long- term strength of the provincial economy. CORE BUSINESSES NADC goals and strategies strongly support government's goals of enhancing People and Prosperity. We do this by facilitating the development of a thriving and progressive northern economy based on northern participation in the work force. Our goals are to: \u007f Receive input into priority northern development opportunities and issues. \u007f Promote opportunities and address barriers to the north's development. \u007f Increase northern skill levels. STRATEGIC APPROACHES The NADC works to address northern issues and opportunities. This is done through consultation, strategic initiatives, and programs. To be successful we work closely with northern organizations and government departments. Keeping people informed of northerndevelopments is an important component of our work. \u007fConsultation: NADC meets with representatives of key northern organizations to identify opportunities and barriers, and to determine their development priorities. \u007fStrategic Initiatives: NADC initiatives promote opportunities and address barriers.265 RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT BUSINESS PLAN 2000-03We focus on developmental strategies based on priority needs as expressed by northerners. We act as a catalyst to raise awareness of northern issues and opportunities, and as a facilitator to identify and work toward solutions to northern constraints. Our role in initiatives includes strategic planning, conducting research, sponsoring events,coordinating projects, and providing advice to government on northern matters. \u007fPrograms: We offer northern post-secondary student bursaries in conjunction with Alberta Learning. We are also piloting Northern LINKS, a program that funds projectswhich encourage northern high school graduates to make the transition to post-secondary education. \u007fCross-government approach: NADC works with other government departments and agencies on initiatives related to the north's development, at a variety of levels: \u007f Interjurisdictional: NADC coordinates Alberta's involvement in northern initiatives that span provincial, territorial and federal governments. \u007f Strategic Initiatives: NADC partners and coordinates with other government departments, the private sector and community-based organizations to carry out strategic initiatives that address northern issues and opportunities. \u007f Administration: NADC's bursary programs are integrated with the administrative processes of Alberta Learning. Northerners and others with an interest in northern development are kept informed of our activities through meetings, news releases, a regular newsletter, event advertising, and updates on our Web site. GOALS AND STRATEGIES Note: [CG] denotes response to cross-government priorities. Our business plan is dynamic. Strategies are continually strengthened and refined through the consultation and discussion process. We pursue strategies that are supported by northern organizations. The NADC is positioned to address emerging opportunities and issues on anongoing basis, and to adjust strategies as necessary.

The Fund grew from a portion of Alberta's oil and gas revenue being deposited into the Fund since inception in 1976 and until 1987.As well, prior to 1982, the Fund kept its investment income. The size of the Heritage Fund peaked in 1987 at $12.7 billion (at cost) and since then has declined by the amount of the annual Capital Projects Divisionexpenditures (the last year of spending by the Capital Projects Division was 1994-95). \u007f On January 1, 1997 the Heritage Fund was restructured in response to a public review of the Fund. The restructuring includes a new governance structure as well as the establishment of clearer investment objectives and performance measures. The Fund's first business plan was implementedin January 1997. FISCAL CONTEXT \u007f Assets and income of the Heritage Fund are fully consolidated with the assets and revenue of the province. As a result, for fiscal planningpurposes and under the Balanced Budget and Debt Retirement Act of 1995: (i) consolidated Heritage Fund income is included in the determination of the province's budget surplus, and (ii) Heritage Fund assets are nettedoff gross liabilities in determining the net debt position of the Province. \u007f The Balanced Budget and Debt Retirement Act requires that the province reduce its net debt to zero by March 31, 2010 beginning in the 1996-97 fiscal year. The net debt can be reduced by applying budget surpluses to either (i) pay down gross debt or (ii) increase assets (for example, by inflation proofing the Heritage Fund). As a result of strongerthan anticipated revenue growth over the last few years, Alberta's net debt was eliminated in 1999. \u007f In March 1999, a new Fiscal Responsibility Act (FRA) was passed. The FRA sets out a legislative schedule to eliminate the Province's accumulated debt in no more than 25 years. The FRA also grants the Provincial Treasurer the discretion to retain such income in the HeritageFund as he considers advisable. \u007f Subsequent to the approval of the business plan by the Standing Committee on the Alberta Heritage Savings Trust Fund, the ProvincialTreasurer decided to retain in the Heritage Fund $230 million of the Fund's 1999-2000 income.ALBERTA HERITAGE SAVINGS TRUST FUND BUSINESS PLAN 2000-03 150PURPOSE \u007f This is the fourth business plan for the Heritage Fund, which amends the previous business plans and incorporates updated financial information and income forecasts. This plan sets out the broad objectives of the Fund as expressed in the legislation, more specific investment objectives, othergoals and strategies to achieve the Fund's objectives, and performance measures. 2000-03 Business Plan The business plan incorporates the following changes: 1. Establish a range for the transfer of assets from the Transition Portfolio to the Endowment Portfolio. Previously, $1.2 billion was transferred annually or $100 million monthly. A range of $1.2 billion to $2.4 billion is now established for the annual transfer. This allowsflexibility to take advantage of market conditions or opportunities without compromising the discipline of \"dollar-averaging\" (the systematic investing of funds over time), used in the transition. 2. Amend the performance benchmarks. The mid-way point of the transition should be reached by the end of the 2000-01 fiscal year. The impact of the Transition Portfolio will diminish over time while theEndowment Portfolio will begin to dominate performance. While comparing the performance of the total Heritage Fund to the Province's borrowing cost will continue to be an important benchmark, it will beless useful to limit the comparison to just the Transition Portfolio due to its declining size and liquidity requirements to fund transfers. The total Fund will be compared to the Province's borrowing costs and a newbenchmark is established for the Transition Portfolio that more closely matches the term and quality structure of the portfolio. 3. In addition, the return of the real estate component of the Endowment Portfolio will be adjusted such that a more direct comparison to the Russell Commercial Property Index can be made. Unlike the real estate component of the Endowment Portfolio, the Russell CommercialProperty Index is calculated using Net Operating Income which omits major expenses such as acquisition and disposal costs, capital expenditures, tenant improvements, leasing costs, depreciation, audit feesand asset administration fees. This difference understates the performance of the Fund's real estate component. 4. The investment limit in the Transition Portfolio for Province of Alberta bond holdings is reduced to 15% from 17%.151 ALBERTA HERITAGE SAVINGS TRUST FUND BUSINESS PLAN 2000-03HERITAGE FUND STRUCTURE The mission of the Heritage Fund is as follows: \"To provide prudent stewardship of the savings from Alberta's non-renewable resources by providing the greatest financial returns for current and future generations of Albertans\". \u007f The government's fiscal plan, published in Budget '99 included unconsolidated annual income from the Heritage Fund of $794.6 million. In the 1998-99 fiscal year, the Heritage Fund generated$932.0 million in income on an unconsolidated basis. The government keeps its books on a consolidated basis and therefore Heritage Fund income is included in consolidated income for the province.Consequently, the level and variability of Heritage Fund income is important to the government's fiscal plan. \u007f If the Fund were invested solely with the objective of optimizing long- term financial returns, it is unlikely that it would generate the level of income experienced in previous years. Income will vary significantly from year to year for the following reasons: 1. An investment policy to maximize long-term returns implies a significantly higher weighting towards investments in equities in comparison to the equity holdings at the time the Fund wasrestructured. While equities have historically provided investors with higher total returns (dividends and capital gains) than fixed income investments, dividend rates in general are lower than interestrates thereby providing lower current income. The timing of realizing capital gains is also uncertain. 2. The well-established capital market principle that increased returns, as provided by equity investments, are accompanied with increased risk or return volatility means that the Fund's income will be more variable. \u007f In order to provide for an orderly transition between the need for current income and long-term investment goals, the Heritage Fund has been divided into two separate portfolios: a Transition Portfolio and anEndowment Portfolio. \u007f Each portfolio is managed independently of the other to meet its own specific investment objective and measured against its correspondingbenchmarks. The overall performance of the Fund is compared to the Province's borrowing cost. \u007f The Transition Portfolio is invested primarily in interest bearing securities with an emphasis on generating current income to support the Province's fiscal plan. \u007f The Endowment Portfolio is invested in a diversified portfolio including interest bearing securities, Canadian equities, international equities, and real estate.ALBERTA HERITAGE SAVINGS TRUST FUND BUSINESS PLAN 2000-03 152\u007f The Transition Portfolio will support current income needs in the first few years and then see its role diminish as it is reduced in size and the Endowment Portfolio grows over the transition period. \u007f Over a maximum ten-year transition period starting in 1996-97, a minimum of $1.2 billion (at cost) in assets will be transferred annually from the Transition Portfolio to the Endowment Portfolio. By December 31, 2005, all Heritage Fund assets will be invested in theEndowment Portfolio if $1.2 billion continues to be transferred on an annual basis. $1.2 billion to $2.4 billion will be transferred in 2000-01 and subsequent years. 12 10 864 2 0SCHEDULE OF TRANSITION* 1997 1999 2001 2003 2005 Transition Portfolio Assets Endowment Portfolio Assets(billions of dollars) * based on an annual transfer of $1.2 billion. \u007f Heritage Fund assets that are consistent with its long term investment objective, or that can readily be disposed of to permit acquisition of appropriate assets have been allocated to the Endowment Portfolio, with the remainder residing in the Transition Portfolio. Since the initialallocation of $1.2 billion on January 1, 1997, an additional $3.6 billion has been transferred from the Transition Portfolio to the Endowment Portfolio as per the transition plan. Below is a breakdown of assets as atDecember 31, 1999.153 ALBERTA HERITAGE SAVINGS TRUST FUND BUSINESS PLAN 2000-03HERITAGE FUND ASSETS BREAKDOWN AS AT DECEMBER 31, 1999 (thousands of dollars)) Heritage Fund Investments At Cost* Fair Value Endowment Portfolio Cash 235,683 235,317 Fixed-income 1,752,376 345,822 357,138 Total Investments - Cash 45,352 Total 7,047,536 Total Heritage Fund Investments 12, 042,788 12,596,458 (excludes accrued interest) * Cost includes amortization of purchase price discount or premium. GOALS, STRATEGIES AND OUTPUTS, OUTCOMES, AND PERFORMANCE MEASURES The legislated investment objective of the Transition Portfolio is: Investments shall be made with the objective of supporting the government's short-term to medium-term income needs as reflected in thegovernment's consolidated fiscal plan. What is the best approach in achieving this objective? \u007f To support the Province's revenue needs the Transition Portfolio is required to generate a stable source of income. Consequently, it is important the assets be revenue generating, and not exposed to significant credit risk. Additionally, due to the transfer program, assetsneed to be liquid (easily traded) so as to facilitate the monthly transfers to the Endowment Portfolio. This is accomplished by having a high quality portfolio of bonds.ALBERTA HERITAGE SAVINGS TRUST FUND BUSINESS PLAN 2000-03 154\u007f In the past, the Transition Portfolio has been compared to the cost of the Province's debt. As the Transition Portfolio declines in size and the liquidity needs increase, due to the transfer program, this comparison becomes less and less meaningful. \u007f The total Heritage Fund represents the Province's asset that is compared against the province's liabilities. Hence, the performance of the Heritage Fund will be compared against the cost of the Province's debt while theTransition Portfolio will be compared against a benchmark that is consistent with the term structure of the Portfolio. The legislated investment objective of the Endowment Portfolio is: Investments shall be made with the objective of maximizing long-term financial returns. \u007f Given a long-term investment horizon, investment practice suggests that a mix of equities (including real estate) and interest-bearing securities best achieves the objective of optimizing financial returns as it providesenhanced returns and diversifies risk. A long-term investment horizon generally means 10 years, however, for investment performance comparisons a minimum period of four years will be examined.Emphasis on \"long-term\" in the investment objective is designed to help the investment manager continue to plan and execute strategies in a long- term context at times when short-term pressures exist.155 ALBERTA HERITAGE SAVINGS TRUST FUND BUSINESS PLAN 2000-03GOAL 1: EARN INCOME TO SUPPORT THE GOVERNMENT'S CONSOLIDATED FISCAL PLAN STRATEGIES/OUTPUTS OUTCOMES PERFORMANCE MEASURES/ BENCHMARKS \u007f Invest Transition Portfolio assets in accordance with the investment industry standard \"Prudent PersonRule\" which assigns the investment managerresponsibility to restrict investment to assets thatwould be approved by a prudent investor. \u007f Invest in interest bearing securities (Canadian dollar issues; non-Canadian dollar issues would beswapped into Canadian dollars) that are rated attime of purchase a minimum of investment grade(BBB or equivalent) by a recognized rating agency orin the absence thereof by Alberta Treasury. \u007f Maintain an average term to maturity for the Transition Portfolio between one year and fouryears.

The Corporations will use the funds t o repay the debentures held by the Heritage Fund Transition Portfolio generally on the dates when the interest rates on thesedebentures are re-set (every five years). In turn, the Fund will use this cash to invest in external assets.157 ALBERTA HERITAGE SAVINGS TRUST FUND BUSINESS PLAN 2000-03GOAL 2: MAKE INVESTMENTS IN THE ENDOWMENT PORTFOLIO TO MAXIMIZE LONG-TERM FINANCIAL RETURNS STRATEGIES/OUTPUTS OUTCOMES PERFORMANCE MEASURES/ BENCHMARKS \u007f Invest Endowment Portfolio assets in accordance with the investment industry standard \"Prudent Person Rule\" which assigns the investment manager responsibility to restrict investment to assets that would be approved by a prudent investor. \u007f Diversify risk and enhance expected returns by allocating the Endowment Portfolio assets amongthe following asset classes and within the notedranges (expressed as a % of the EndowmentPortfolio's market value): Asset Class Holdings (%) Interest-BearingSecurities 430% to 50% Equity570% to 50% \u007f Diversify investments within each subcategory of the asset classes set out above. \u007f The Investment Operations Committee (see Attachment A) will recommend minimum andmaximum holdings for the asset classes and reviewperiodically the benchmarks to be used inmeasuring performance. \u007f The Investment Management Division of Alberta Treasury will vary the allocation of assets withinthe above policy ranges based on the outlook forfinancial markets. \u007f The Investment Operations Committee will determine the extent of use of external investmentmanagers to manage portions of the Endowment Portfolio, and the criteria for their selection.\u007f The market rate of return on the Endowment Portfolio is expected to exceed thecost of the Province'sdebt. \u007f The Portfolio is expected to generate a real rate ofreturn of 5% at an acceptable level of risk over a moving four-yearperiod. \u007f Market rate of return is expected to be greaterthan a passively investedbenchmark portfolio.Performance Measures \u007f The market value rate of return will be compared against the borrowingcost of the province on a movingfour-year basis. \u007f The market value rate of return will be compared against the level ofinflation to determine whether the long term capital market assumptions on which theinvestment policy is based areachieving the returns relative toexpectations. \u007f The market value rate of return will be compared against a \"policybenchmark return\" to determine theimpact of fund management onperformance.

The Committee includes a majority of private sector members with relevant financial and business expertise. \u007f Ongoing investment decisions will be made within Alberta Treasury consistent with the allocation of responsibilities set out in Attachment A. \u007f For each component of the Fund that is externally managed, an investment management mandate describing its purpose, goals andconstraints will be established. \u007f The investment management mandates of external managers will be consistent with this Business Plan. \u007f The Auditor General is the auditor of the Fund. \u007f There are restrictions on the kind of investments that can be made. Fund assets are to be invested prudently and cannot be used directly foreconomic development or social investment purposes. INCOME AND EXPENSES \u007f The rates of return on, and the income from, the Fund likely will become more volatile as the Endowment Portfolio grows and as equity investments increase. While equity investments have historically, overlong periods of time, provided higher rates of return than fixed income investments they are also significantly more volatile. Capital gains on traditional equity investments are not recognized as income until theinvestment is sold, so strong performance reflected in rates of return may not be reflected in income for some time. Unlike traditional equity instruments, income and expenses on equity index swaps are accrued asearned, as a result, market value gains and losses are realized as they occur. \u007f Following are current projections of Heritage Fund income based on the assumptions noted. Actual results will vary from projected income depending on the extent to which actual interest rates and equity market returns vary from the assumptions used. Forecast gross investmentincome decreases over the fiscal plan period due to the lower interest rate environment and the increasing investment in equities in the Endowment Portfolio, which contribute lower \"current income\". \u007f The income projections include interest income, dividend income, capital gains or losses only when they are realized, such as when an investment is sold, and income and expense on index swaps andinterest rate swaps accrued as earned. \u007f The income projections do not include unrealized capital gains.ALBERTA HERITAGE SAVINGS TRUST FUND BUSINESS PLAN 2000-03 160HERITAGE FUND INCOME FORECASTS AND UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS 1999-2000 795.7 Assumptions (%)1.
