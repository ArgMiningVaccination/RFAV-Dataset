What is Integrative Medicine? Integrative medicine is a healing-oriented medicine that takes account of the whole person (body, mind & spirit), including all aspects of lifestyle. It emphasizes the therapeutic relationship and makes use of all appropriate therapies, both conventional and alternative. Integrative Medicine & Direct Primary Care At Osteopathic Healing Arts in Libertyville, IL, we offer both conventional and alternative integrative medicine. Through our Direct Primary Care (DPC) model, you receive comprehensive primary health care and pay for this care through a monthly membership fee. This fee covers the primary integrative medicine services you see below and may also cover others not currently listed. We do not participate in any insurance or plans, thus being able to avoid the ever-increasing demands and costs associated with accepting insurance.
