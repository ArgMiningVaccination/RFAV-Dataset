Injectable influenza vaccines are especially important for people with a history of cancer because of the increased risk of developing serious influenza complications. People who live with or care for cancer patients and survivors should also be vaccinated against seasonal influenza.Did Y ou Know? CDC estimates that since 2010, influenza-related hospitalizations in the United States have ranged from 140,000 to 710,000 and influenza- related deaths have ranged from 12,000 to 56,000. About 320,000 people get pneumococcal pneumonia every year, leading to over 150,000 hospitalizations and 5,000 deaths. Each year, 1 million people get shingles and some will have severe pain that can continue long after the rash clears up. HPV causes over 27 ,000 cancers in women and men each year and about 4,000 deaths among women. Ensure medical providers record every immunization given in ShowMeVax - Missouri's Immunization Registry - to allow healthcare professionals at future visits know what vaccines have already been administered.Shingles CDC recommends adults 50 years and older receive the shingles vaccine, Shingrix\u00a9. Shingles is a reactivation of the chickenpox virus that can cause a blistering rash, fever, chills and crippling pain which may develop into a chronic pain syndrome. Individuals who have a history of cancer or chronic disease have an increased risk for developing shingles, so receiving the Shingrix\u00a9 vaccine is especially important.Human Papillomavirus (HPV) HPV vaccination can prevent over 90% of HPV cancers. The HPV vaccine is recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for both males and females from age 11 years through 26 years. The HPV vaccine is known to prevent nine strains of the virus which can cause six different types of cancer. People with weakened immune systems may be less able to fight off HPV and more likely to develop health problems from it. Pneumococcal Having influenza increases a person's risk for pneumococcal disease. Pneumococcal pneumonia is a serious influenza- related complication that can cause death. People with cancer or other diseases that weaken the immune system should ask a doctor about the pneumococcal vaccine.Cancer survivors and people with chronic diseases are particularly vulnerable to infection, so it is especially important that survivors as well as caregivers of survivors stay up-to-date on all recommended immunizations. Additionally, recipients of Hematopoietic Cell Transplant (HCT) treatment of all ages are at increased risk for certain vaccine-preventable diseases and should be revaccinated routinely after HCT treatment.IMMUNIZATIONS Tetanus, Diptheria & Pertussis (Tdap) CDC recommends T dap vaccination for everyone. Protection decreases over time, so a booster shot is needed every 10 years. Cancer survivors and people with chronic diseases have an increased risk of infections, so this vaccine is especially important for these individuals, as well as caregivers, to prevent getting and spreading serious disease.
