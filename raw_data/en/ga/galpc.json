The graduation took place at Marston Pavilion aboard Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune where 10 residents and 11 interns were able to graduate in front of a live audience, a major change from last year's strict COVID-19 limitations. The 2021 graduates received 100% pass rates on their Family Medicine Certification Examinations given by the American Board of Family Medicine, making this the 10th year in a row the program has achieved a 100% pass rate. \"This program, with what I have learned, the training I have received will better enable me to go out into the fleet and provide world class medicine anywhere in the world,\" states Lieutenant Commander Robert Eberly, Chief Resident. \"I believe in [Navy Medicine's] mission, and I believe our training helps us do our mission anywhere in the world, wherever we are called.\" Eberly, along with Lieutenant Tameem Sbaiti, were selected by residents and faculty to represent the graduating class as Chief Residents. The Chief Residents serve their class by acting as liaisons between the residents, faculty and other departments of the Medical Center. \"I believe that NMCCL is a unique environment as we are one of the more rural naval medical centers,\" explained Eberly. \"You get a full experience here, to include obstetrics, trauma and every aspect to make you a well-rounded Navy physician.\" Eberly, who will go on to a Sports Medicine Fellowship in Rochester, NY and Sbaiti will soon join Fleet Surgical Team Four based in Norfolk, VA. When asked to describe the program for future residents and interns, Sbaiti had this say, \"I think this is a hidden gem of the Navy, with respect especially to Graduate Medical Education. I chose this location to do my residency because the program and the people here are amazing. Every person here that I have interacted with has been fabulous, from start to finish.\" The graduation ceremony's guest speaker was Retired Vice Adm. and 38th Surgeon General of the U.S. Navy, Forrest Faison III. Faison called on graduates to hone in on the purpose of their lives. \"There is really only one reason for family medicine and that is to serve and care for others. At the end of the day, this profession to which we have devoted our entire lives is one of caring service and compassion. It is a true profession of the heart,\" said Faison. \"You will not cure everyone you touch; we know this by now...but to each person that you do touch, you represent hope when hope seems lost, a light in some of the darkest hours of their lives.\" Following graduation, residents and interns will go on to their next duty stations. Naval Hospital Guam, U.S.S. Harry S. Truman, and Naval Branch Clinic Bahrain are a few of the next duty stations where graduates will continue practicing family medicine. "}
