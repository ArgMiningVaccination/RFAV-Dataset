This online event is part of the [Royal Society's Summer Science Exhibition 2022](https://royalsociety.org/science-events-and-lectures/2022/summer-science-exhibition/). Our panel of expert scientists explored the science behind the pandemic, and discussed what it is about this particular virus that makes it so infectious and potentially life-threatening on an unprecedented global scale. Whether it is a private dinner for 10 or a drinks reception for 800, we have the experience and the commitment to exceed your expectations. Find information on the Royal Society's upcoming scientific meetings, including how to request an invitation and how to register. You can also explore past events through programmes and recordings. "}
