Make sure your uploads comply with the requirements and guidelines to avoid delays. AUDIO FORMAT & QUALITY At the moment, Insight Timer only accepts MP3 files. Here is a [free online mp3 converter](http://media.io/). The optimal length for meditation is between 10-20 minutes (slightly longer for music and talks), however, we have content that ranges from 45 seconds to 120 minutes. Moreover, unless it is a music track, talk, or meditation for sleep, using an ending bell is recommended but not required. Note that you must provide your own ending bell as Insight Timer does not supply this. Recordings should also minimize external noises and make sure that the volume is set properly. Recordings of live talks or seminars where miscellaneous sounds cannot be avoided may be accepted provided that it is indicated in the description. Here are our [best practices for content.](https://insight-timer.freshdesk.com/en/support/solutions/articles/67000664986-best-practices-for-content-) COPYRIGHTS, PERMISSIONS, & ACCREDITATIONS Before you upload anything onto the app, be sure you have all the necessary rights. We take issues with copyright very seriously so remember to credit all musicians for background music and other teachers who may have influenced your work. If you are uploading on someone else's behalf or using a trademarked term/practice, written permission may be requested. Any material that is found to breach copyright will be removed immediately. Royalty-free music tracks will not be allowed on the app unless used as background music for a guided meditation and/or as a sample for an original musical piece. Works already in the public domain may be accepted (e.g. readings, lectures, stories), provided original creators are properly credited. Furthermore, proper credentials are required if you are using a specialized practice like Neuroscience, Psychology, MBSR, ACT, the Wim Hof Method, and the like. DISCLAIMERS & WARNINGS If your audio tackles sensitive and triggering topics like depression, eating disorders, and the like, we require that you place a \"trigger warning\" note at the beginning of the recording as well as the track description. It must also be emphasized that it is not a substitute for professional help and that there are no scientific claims. Furthermore, reminders to exercise necessary caution and steps to ensure safety and health, like avoiding driving or operating heavy machinery, should also be included in the recording and the description when necessary. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE Please read our policy regarding the use of AI for content creation [here](https://help.insighttimer.com/support/solutions/articles/67000723124-can-teachers-use-artificial-intelligence-ai-on-their-insight-timer-offerings-). PROHIBITED TOPICS To make sure that Insight Timer remains a place of refuge, we refrain from accepting content that deals with or contains any of the following topics: - Promotions We kindly ask you to refrain from including any cross-promotional content in any of your offerings or during any interaction with our platform/audience. This includes any mention of products, services, email lists, websites, books, courses, retreats, contact details, and other platforms in the form of video, audio, or text. Our goal is to create a space where teachers can focus solely on sharing their practices and perspectives without any external distractions. We understand that promoting your work is an essential aspect of being a teacher, and we want to provide you with opportunities to do so. Therefore, we ask that you limit any external promotion to using the web link on your teacher profile. This will allow you to share your work while also ensuring that our community remains a safe and supportive space for everyone.

However, until we put appropriate filters for tracks that are sexual in nature, contain sexual references, have sexual undertones, and/or are sexually suggestive, we shall refrain from accepting such. - Hyper-Political, Hate Speech, & Explicit Language Content that promotes, bashes, and discredits specific organizations or movements will not be accepted. Topics like this may be divisive and polarizing to a general audience. We also do not tolerate hate speech or discrimination of any kind. Tracks with explicit language may be accepted as long as it is within the context and not used profusely. A disclaimer/warning in the description is also required. - Any Form of Hypnosis We believe hypnosis should be practiced only in a safe environment, preferably in a face-to-face setting with a trained practitioner. - References to Use of Substances We prohibit content that references, promotes, encourages, or implies the use of drugs, alcohol, or any state-altering substances. - Money-making Programs & Financial Services We do not accept content that deals with, promotes, sells, or offers any financial services. This includes crypto-currencies, insurance, multi-level marketing, investment plans, wealth management, and others. - Suicide Discussing the topic of suicide may be triggering to some of our more vulnerable users. Therefore, until measures that will safeguard user well-being and safety are in place, we will not be accepting such content. - Children voices While we applaud and encourage starting a mindfulness practice at a young age, we'd like our resources to be provided by qualified teachers. We welcome content aimed at parents to listen with their children, however, we do not accept content that includes children's voices.
