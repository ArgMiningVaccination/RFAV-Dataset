For further information contact beverley.devalois@nhs.net Introduction As part of a series of exploratory studies into using acupuncture to manage menopausal side effects of adjuvant hormonal treatments for breast cancer, we investigated the National Acupuncture Detoxification Association ( NADA) ear acupuncture protocol. Anecdotal evidence suggested that NADA treatment reduced hot flushes and night sweats (HF&NS) in substance detoxification. Methods Women age 35 years diagnosed with early breast cancer Without relapse or metastatic disease 6 months post active treatment (surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy) Taking adjuvant hormonal therapy 6 months Experiencing HF&NS 3 months Self-reporting an average of 4 HF&NS per 24 -hour period. Participants Acupuncture protocols Treatment once weekly, for 8 treatments Using the NADA protocol delivered in small groups of up to 5 women, or Semi -standardised traditional acupuncture treatment ( see Publications ) Administered by a licensed acupuncturist Hot Flush Diaries - measured HF&NS frequency and severity over a 2 - week period Women's Health Questionnaire (WHQ) - measured 9 domains of physical and emotional wellbeing associated with the menopause transition Problem Rating Score (PRS) - measured how bothersome women find their HF&NS. Measures were administered at : Baseline - 2 weeks prior to treatment Mid-tx - after the fourth treatment EOT - end of treatment EOT+4 - 4 weeks after EOT EOT+18 - 18 weeks after EOT. Measurement Results 50 out of 54 women recruited completed 8 acupuncture treatments in each study. Comparing Hot Flush and Night Sweat Frequency Comparing Emotional and Physical Wellbeing At EOT, the WHQ domains displayed below showed significant improvement in both studies. Overall, both groups showed similar scores and levels of improvement at each time point. All changes were clinically significant (a difference of 0.10 to 0.20), apart from Depressed Mood in the TA group. Recruitment and compliance Comparing Problem Rating Scores (PRS) PRS were similar for both groups at each measurement point. All changes within groups across time were statistically (paired t test) and clinically significant. There were no significant differences between groups at EOT (p=0.87). Discussion NADA reduced frequency of HF&NS by 35.9% after 8 treatments Improvements in wellbeing and problem rating scores were comparable to TA. NADA was less effective in reducing HF&NS than TA at Mid -tx and EOT. There were no significant differences in longer term outcomes. More frequent treatment may improve outcomes; however, the women in this study found committing to weekly treatment was sufficiently challenging. Conclusion Acknowledgements The median numbers of HF&NS per day at baseline and EOT were: 48 The primary endpoint was the comparison at EOT. Reductions in frequency for both groups were significant at all time points. There were significant differences between groups at Mid -tx (p=0.008) and EOT (p=0.038) in favour of TA, but no significant differences at follow -up. * Somatic = Backache/pain, Dizzy spells, Frequent urination, Headache, Nausea, Tiredness, Pins and Needles Key Questions This standardised protocol uses 5 acupuncture points on the surface of the ear. It is designed for use in a group setting. In the UK, it can be delivered by licensed acupuncturists and by non - acupuncturists who are trained and annually assessed by NADA UK.

How do the results of NADA treatment compare with the results of our previous study using traditional acupuncture (TA)? Evaluating the NADA ear acupuncture protocol to manage breast cancer treatment related hot flushes & night sweats (HF&NS) Beverley de Valois, Teresa Young, Nicola Robinson, Christine McCourt, Jane Maher Conducted at the Lynda Jackson Macmillan Centre, Mount Vernon Cancer Centre, Rickmansworth Road, Northwood, Middlesex, United Kingdom HA6 2RN Comparison of Mean % Reduction in Hot Flush Frequency Change over baseline at N = Mean % Reduction 95% CI Lower 95% CI Upper Mid-tx NADA 50 23.6 15.3 31.5 TA 48 40.8 30.1 50.0 EOT NADA 47 35.9 25.4 45.4 TA 48 49.8 40.5 56.5 EOT+4 NADA 45 37.5 25.4 47.6 TA 47 41.2 31.0 49.5 EOT+18 NADA 38 37.1 24.8 47.4 TA 47 41.8 29.1 49.5 This study suggests that NADA may provide a simple non -pharmacological option for managing HF&NS. Further research is warranted; NADA and TA should be compared concurrently.
