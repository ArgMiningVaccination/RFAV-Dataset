They are three well known and very widely used homeopathic remedies - used both topically and/or taken orally. You may know Arnica well - it is famous for helping to heal bruises and soft tissue trauma - many people swear by it after general and dental surgery! You may even have it in your first aid kit. What about utilising all the other thousands of available homeopathic remedies? Safe to be taken by anyone - I encourage you to explore Homeopathy further. Homeopathic remedies (or preparations) are made via extraction - a method which is a process of dilution and succussion (fancy word meaning vigorously shaken). It is this exact process which removes any possible toxic properties from the substance, thereby releasing the healing capabilities held in each substance. Homeopathic remedies are preserved in a very small amount of alcohol and can be taken as pilules, small tablets, liquid or included in creams/lotions to (e.g. Arnica, Hypericum, Hypercal, Calendula). Homeopathic tissue salts and work quickly. Magnesium phos (or mag phos as it is known) is great with muscle cramps - particularly period cramps. Put 4 tablets under the tongue and let dissolve. Repeat every 15 minutes for a total of 4 doses. Put another 4 tablets in a water bottle and continue to sip throughout the day to alleviate cramps. Another great tissue salt is ferrum phos - a great iron tonic for those with low iron levels. A gentle way to restore iron without the side effects that iron can bring (* note: not a main treatment for anaemia), but you can use on a continual basis to prevent the occurrence of low iron levels/anaemia again. Only to be taken if a blood test confirms low iron levels and supplementation has been recommended by your healthcare provider. Homeopathic remedies can be safely used alongside other prescribed medications and treatments.
