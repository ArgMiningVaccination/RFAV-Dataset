Chinese medicine is a traditional style of treatment and medicine which is based on over 2000 years of Chinese medical experience and practice. Over thousands of years, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has evolved and it is now increasingly being used as a complementary health approach or treatment form in both Europe and the United States. While western medicine traditionally focuses on treating disease and pathology, TCM has a more holistic approach and treats the whole being rather than an individual condition per se. Why is it done? TCM views the human body as a version of the larger universe which it is a part of. One of the basic principles of TCM is the body's 'qi' (or ch'i), meaning vital energy, flows and circulates through different channels in the body called meridians, which are connected to different organs and the functions performed in the body. It is also based on concepts such as yin and yang, or harmony between two opposing forces, and the belief that disease results from an imbalance between yin and yang. TCM also considers the five elements (fire, earth, metal, wood, and water) and the role that they play in explaining how the body functions. TCM is considered to be a form of alternative medicine or complementary medicine, as there is not enough scientific study or evidence to show outcomes. What does it involve? TCM covers a broad range of practices which have been a staple part of the methodology for thousands of years. TCM incorporates herbal medicine and herbal remedies, acupuncture, cupping, massage, exercise, and dietary therapy. Treatment is determined based on the 'pattern of disharmony' (i.e the disease) perceived in the body. How do you prepare for TCM? TCM should be used as a complement to conventional care rather than a standalone treatment. You should always see your healthcare provider (e.g a GP or your regular doctor) for diagnosis and a consultation regarding your medical problem. Inform your doctor that you are engaging in complementary medicine or health approaches. Before visiting a TCM doctor, you can check their training and experience as complementary therapies are regulated throughout the European Union - TCM is no exception. You can also check research and studies related to the therapy you are considering. Alternatives to this treatment TCM is an alternative in itself and should be considered complementary medicine rather than an alternative to conventional care. Other countries in East and South Asia such as Korea, Japan, Singapore, and Thailand have their own traditional systems of medicine which have now developed enough to be considered distinctive medicine systems of their own. TCM remains by far the most widespread alternative therapy of the Asian traditional medicine systems.12-09-2014 24-04-2017 Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) What is traditional Chinese medicine (TCM)?
