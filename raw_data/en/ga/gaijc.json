I chose hypnotherapy as my specialty because it felt safe and more accepted than what I initially wanted to study. After starting school, I began my [Holistic Wellness Coach ](https://swiha.edu/health-and-wellness-coach-training-program/)courses and quickly found I was not being true to myself, or authentic in how I wanted to show up as a Practitioner. I changed my specialties from hypnotherapy which did not resonate for me, to [Traditional Reiki](https://swiha.edu/reiki-training-programs/), [Polarity Practitioner](https://swiha.edu/polarity-programs/) Program, and Holy Reiki. I chose [Holy Reiki](https://swiha.edu/reiki-training-programs/#reiki-holy) to be a bridge for those with religious backgrounds wanting a change and wanting to incorporate a different way of sacredness in their life that resonated deeper than what they had been doing. Being an Angel Medium I have been able to shift Holy Reiki into Angel Reiki which resonates deeper and more easeful for me as I have my Angel family to amplify and assist in the facilitation of each healing session, and process. My Angel family is able to give me messages to pass on to my clients for a deeper level of healing, and closure. I found the sweet spot where I am in complete flow in my practices. What was your life like before SWIHA? What led you to SWIHA and to your particular program of study? Why are you passionate about this modality?: My life was not picture perfect, yet from the outside looking in it was socially picture perfect. I began my spiritual freedom from past ingrained programming in 2012 after my father passed away. Not able to set boundaries at the time, I fell away from my true beliefs and practices to appease others and make my relationship with my extremely religious mother easier. Quickly, I found out easier isn't always better. It came to a point where I was trying to please everyone around me- even my in-laws who have never accepted or approved of me as a person, and as a whole being. After 5 deaths in our family in 3 years, isolation due to location, and wanting my \"MORE\"; I quickly became a miserable person that started using more and more alcohol to numb my true feelings and energy. I had done this since I was a child speaking and interacting with my Angel family, which in turn shut my abilities off for almost a lifetime due to my family's religious beliefs that were not mine, from an early age. I knew their beliefs and values were not aligned with mine at a very young age. Forced to follow religions I did not buy into or believe in, and there was still a level of ingrained fear to stray away from those traditional beliefs within my family. After spending the day with my dear friend Stephi, she introduced me to SWIHA and offered me a class schedule. I immediately decided after raising children as a stay-at-home mother to my 16-year-old and 7-year-old, supporting my husband in his career for 18 years- It was now MY time. With my husband, children, and dear friends of mine Lori and Rex's support and push to go back to school I dove into SWIHA headfirst ready to embrace my true calling and purposes! Is there a \"defining moment\" you'd like to speak about? When did you know that you were on the right path?: I have had many defining moments throughout my student career at SWIHA. It began in the Holistic Wellness courses taught by James Patrick and Mimi Gahee; a course that is a part of my degree program. This is where I became aware of how uncomfortable I was in my body, life, and relationships, and an understanding of why. This is where I also discovered my \"WHY\" for my private practice [Be Well 360, LLC](https://bewell360llc.com/). I immediately knew I was continuing to move up the right path, the path that resonated deeply on a soul level when I took Polarity 1 with Gary Strauss, Lisa Kearn, And Jen Sanders. This first modality course opened me up. I started remembering my truth, and the spiritual experiences I had shut down, buried, and forgotten in my adolescent years. In this first energetic course, my abilities started to return and became more prominent in my everyday life. This felt so true and right; there was no way I could deny my true self any longer, so I dove in completely headfirst once again into these courses, experiences, and my spiritual healing and development, which has changed me forever in the best ways possible. Has your life significantly changed? How does intention/mindfulness show up?: My life has changed dramatically in so many ways. When I look back at the dark place I was prior to starting my quest at [SWIHA](https://swiha.edu/all-programs/) I feel such lightness, blessings, and gratitude for where I have been able to evolve through choice and dedication to myself and my truth. I am finally at peace with myself, and my past, and feel such gratitude for where I am headed. I am better able to move through the process of healing, witness my emotions rather than identify with them, and change my perspective in the moments of awareness that come to me. I use my ability to pause before I react. These courses, instructors, and the energy held within this institution have allowed me the space I needed to truly come to terms and accept my past leading me to self-forgiveness, surrender, self-acceptance, self-awareness, and a new perspective on life as a whole. Life now happens for me rather than to me. This is the significance that has led to much of my personal and professional successes. Now that I have gone through so many incredible healing processes throughout my student career, I am now able to commune with my Angel family, receive guidance, see energy such as aura, Higher Selves, and Messages from the Divine, and my Angels to pass along for a deeper level of healing for myself, and my clientele. What goals did you have the past year and how did living with intention help you reach them?: I am in a healthy place in my life with happiness, fulfillment, purpose, and flow. I've learned how to balance all aspects of Self to live a peaceful and purposeful life. I have learned to trust my Angel family and receive guidance that allows me to surrender to the process of becoming significant within the community, and my family regarding healing, expanding, evolving, and continued trauma support. I am currently doing 1:1 sessions with clients in my private healing space and via zoom. I teach live and real-time classes and workshops around spiritual development, how to use energy, and Full and New Moon workshops where I teach how to effectively, and efficiently use the different moon energies for the Highest Good of All. Starting in October, I will be offering Reiki courses and attunements for corporate staff, and for those who are drawn to this work with the intention of bringing as many healers into our community as possible. I have also been asked to do multiple podcast interviews about my company, and what I do within my company to support the holistic community, those interested in becoming a part of it, and those wanting to know more prior to signing up for a service or session with practitioners. What inspired you to start your own business? What services do you offer? How do you powerfully impact clients? How are the skills you learned at SWIHA supporting your work?: I am the founder, owner, and CEO of Be Well 360, LLC. I started my company to focus on helping individuals who have also suffered through trauma, and childhood trauma; and are looking for continued trauma support. My goal is to empower each client to step into their power, take responsibility for their lives, and experience the power of choice. As a [Holistic Healing Arts Practitioner](https://swiha.edu/integrative-healing-arts-practitioner-programs/), it is my purpose to assist, support, coach, and guide individuals in finding what resonates for them, how to go through the process of healing with as much ease as possible, be an accountability partner, hold a non-judgmental safe space for individuals to explore, and express themselves in healthy resonating ways. I use all my modalities for complete holistic healing. I begin with therapeutic communication, energy work that resonates with the clients which are followed by exploratory worksheets and prompts, physical movement, and supportive nutrition information they may use if they CHOOSE to. I also incorporate sound healing, and Aromatherapy; I do all of this with the intention it is for the Highest and Greatest Good for all involved and live by the ETHICS OF Do No Harm. Not only am I a Holistic Healing Arts Practitioner, Holistic Continued Trauma Support Coach, Reiki Master Teacher, An Associate Polarity Therapy Practitioner; I am also an Ordained Priestess through the Universal Life Church as well as An Ordained Minister through the American Marriage Ministry. I am also an [End of Life Doula](https://swiha.edu/integrative-healing-arts-practitioner-online-programs/) and a member of the National End of Life Doula Alliance (NEDA). I focus on our human experience as a whole from inner child healing, childhood trauma continued support, life trauma continued support, and support during the end-of-life transition for individuals while also providing grief cycle support for the family members involved, while using all of my modalities as they resonate with the individuals coming to me for holistic and natural healing. What was the greatest lesson(s) you learned while at SWIHA?: There are so many lessons and \"Blessons\" I have learned and absorbed into my being while at SWIHA. The most important lesson I learned was this work is natural and natural for me. I can trust myself and hold strong discernment in my work and personal life. I also learned that grace, patience, compassion, and unconditional love for self are a huge part of going through healing processes with ease. Healing does not always have to be hard, uncomfortable, or scary. It can be a process with flow when working with a practitioner who is trauma aware, trauma-sensitive, non-judgmental, neutral, and works from a place of unconditional love for another Soul traveling through a human experience. What advice do you have for those wanting to live with intention and mindfulness?: Trust Thy Self! After that my advice would be to surrender to the processes you will begin to go through as you dive into your education here at SWIHA. I believe we all have innate intelligence, and as subtle as it is, it still guides us if we pause to listen. We have all been guided to SWIHA for a reason whether Divinely Guided, Personal, or Professionally, and/or out of a place of genuine curiosity. Anything else you want to add about living ON-PURPOSE?: This journey has been a huge catalyst for me in the way I live my life, the way I experience life, personal and professional relationship dynamics, how to set and hold boundaries, and how to be and connect with Self, My Angels, The Divine Source of All, and My Higher Self for oneness and connectedness. I have left this program with an internal liberation of Self allowing me to live my life my way; authentically and unapologetically. Before I lived life by values, terms, and expectations others had put on me including societal programming, religious and spiritual programming, and abuses. I was living in the past traumas of every kind I endured throughout my life and childhood. I am no longer Identifying with the victim, martyr, or resentful caregiver roles while suffering in silence, and drinking away my power. I am a survivor and a warrior in my life. I now stand before you completely authentic, perfectly imperfect, in my power with unconditional love for Self-including forgiveness, grace, and compassion for not knowing what I didn't know previously on my spiritual journey through this human experience.
