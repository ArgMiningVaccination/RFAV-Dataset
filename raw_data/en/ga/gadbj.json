[Is your child sick?](#130517161-3) Sometimes it is hard to know if your child is well enough to attend school or not. Our School Nurse Office has provided the following Sick Child Brochure to help parents decide if they should send their child to school or keep them at home. [Sick Child Brochure - English](/ko/community/nurse/_health-clinic-services-3/SickChildBrochure_ENG_032021.pdf) [Sick Child Brochure - Korean](/ko/community/nurse/_health-clinic-services-3/SickChildBrochureKOR-032021.pdf) [Sick Child Brochure - Chinese](/ko/community/nurse/_health-clinic-services-3/SickChildBrochure-CHN-032021.pdf) [Health Policies](#130517161-4) Medical attention is the responsibility of the parent. TIS defines a \"sick\" child as the following: students should not be sent to school if they have cough or running nose that they cannot independently control inside a classroom, fever (at or above 100\u00b0F/37.7\u00b0C), rash related with illness (chicken pox, measles, roseola, etc.), or have vomited or had diarrhea in the past 24 hours. Illness spreads quickly in the school setting. Keeping a sick child at home shows care for other school families and helps keep the school environment a much healthier and safer place for your child. If a child is recovering from an illness or injury and is required to stay indoors during recess or physical education, a parent's or physician's notice must be provided to the student's teacher or divisional secretary. Your child will be sent home from school for any of the following reasons: Purulent (containing pus) or discolored nasal discharge; temperature at or above 100\u00b0F/37.7\u00b0C; if the student is too ill or uncomfortable to adequately function in a classroom setting. Students who have a fever or emesis (vomiting) will automatically be sent home. Students may also be excluded from school, regardless of symptoms, including falling asleep in class, if teachers deem them too uncomfortable to participate in class activities. Students who are ill will be sent home after parents or emergency contacts have been notified. Secondary students may take a taxi home with parent permission and if the school nurse judges their condition to be reasonably manageable via independent travel. Parents will be asked to pick up their sick child as soon as they can, preferably within an hour after notification. If a student has been sent home, he/she may not return to school that day. Students must stay at home until they are symptom free for at least 24 hours: for example, a student who vomits at school on Tuesday may not return to school earlier than Thursday and until they have not vomited for at least 24 hours. Your child may return to school when they have been temperature-free for 24 hours, nasal drainage is clear, and they therefore cease to be a threat to the well-being of others. The symptoms of nausea, vomiting and diarrhea can be caused by many different viruses, bacteria, or even parasites. If your child has been nauseated or vomited in the past 24 hours, please keep your child at home. This will help protect other students. Absences Absences must be reported by parents to divisional secretaries no later than 9:15 a.m. on the day in which the student is absent. The reason for the absence must be stated. Excused absences include illness, death in the family, and pre-approved family vacations. Students who arrive at school after 8:30 a.m. must check in with the divisional secretary before they will be admitted to class. Those who arrive after 11:15 a.m. will be counted absent for a full day in ECC and Elementary. Secondary students who are absent due to illness for more than three days per quarter must provide a doctor's written explanation, otherwise the absence will be considered unexcused. Students who do not attend school due to illness will not be permitted to take part in athletic activities that day. Students must arrive at school prior to 11:15 a.m. in order to be eligible for participation in after school activities. Online Annual Update in PowerSchool Every year in April/May, as part of the re-enrollment process parents will fill out an online Annual Update form in PowerSchool. If there are special concerns related to any illness, please note this. If there are any updates in your child's health of immunization status, please email the updated information to the TIS nurses at nurse@tiseagles.com or send a copy of the record with the student. Medical Report for New Students and Students Entering Grades 1, 6 and 9 As part of our effort to ensure a safe and healthy learning community, a Student Medical Report (SMR) is required for all new students and returning students entering grades 1, 6 and 9. The information you provide will alert staff to any special requirements or restrictions needed for school activities. This packet should be completed and returned to the School Nurse's Office by the end of the first week of school. This report includes: The Immunization Record provides a list of immunizations required by our school as recommended by the World Health Organization - Attach a copy of original vaccination records. - If records are not in English, complete this form as well. - When your child receives new immunizations, send a copy of the new records to the school nurse's office. The Student Medical Exam must be completed by a medical practitioner. The school accepts medical exams which were completed within 1 year prior to admission. No laboratory tests are required unless the medical practitioner deems it necessary.

It's IMPORTANT that we all be aware of the danger of overlooked concussions. If you or our coaches suspect a student has suffered a concussion, no matter how mild, the student will be taken out of play and evaluated. [Forms](#130517161-7) Air Quality Index (AQI) 2 Air Quality Information Air quality can become unhealthy due to pollutants such as ground-level ozone and particle pollution. Ozone is especially damaging to the lungs of children and those who work and play outside and is mainly a problem during hot summers. Particle pollution - especially fine particles such as those found in smoke, haze or dust - contains microscopic solids or liquid droplets that are so small that they can get deep into the lungs and cause serious health problems. Particle pollution is the main concern in China.

The school nurses check the Air Quality Index (AQI) online every morning at 8 am. Using the [TIS Air Quality Implication Chart](/ko/community/nurse/_air-quality-information-and-tis-policy-3/AQI-Implication-Chart.pdf) (click to open) the school nurse decides which color code the actual AQI has and what the implications are. From AQI 150 (color code red) and higher the divisional secretaries will be informed about the implications. The school nurse will check again at 11:30 am and 2:30 pm. If students are known with asthma problems, a school nurse will communicate with the parents to decide if they can follow the TIS policy or need to have stricter implications. A list of those students who might need special attention will be distributed to the teachers.
