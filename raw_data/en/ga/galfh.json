Source: Getty Images - CVS Health recently [announced](https://cvshealth.com/news-and-insights/press-releases/cvs-health-expands-community-access-to-covid-19-vaccines) that it is expanding access to COVID-19 vaccines to eligible populations at a limited number of CVS Pharmacy locations across 11 states. In total, there will be 250,000 initial doses available, which the company sourced directly from the federal government. CVS plans to expand to additional states and boost the number of stores offering vaccinations as more supply becomes available. Vaccinations will be offered through appointment only starting on February 9and pharmacy locations will begin administering the vaccine on February 11. \"Our presence in communities across the country makes us an ideal partner for administering vaccines in a safe, convenient, and familiar manner,\" Karen S. Lynch, president and chief executive officer of CVS Health, said in the announcement. \"This is particularly true for underserved communities, which have been a focus for us throughout the pandemic,\" Lynch continued. Over 90,000 healthcare professionals, including [pharmacists](https://pharmanewsintel.com/news/hhs-authorizes-pharmacists-to-administer-childhood-vaccines), licensed pharmacy technicians, and nurses will participate in the vaccination effort. This allows CVS to administer 20 to 25 million shots per month. Part of CVS Health's federal partnership, the criteria for which states can receive the COVID-19 vaccine, timing, and vaccine supply is determined by the federal government, while eligibility is determined by the state, CVS Health [explained](https://www.cvs.com/immunizations/covid-19-vaccine#acc_link_content_section_box_1308109738_boxpar_accordion_2011799818_14). The states included in the latest effort include California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Texas, and Virginia. California, Texas, Virginia, Massachusetts, and New York will receive the highest doses of the vaccine. Specifically, California will receive 81,00 doses across 100 stores, Texas will receive 38,000 doses across 70 stores, Virginia will receive 26,000 doses across 28 stores, Massachusetts will receive 21,600 across 18 stores, and New York will receive 20,600 doses across 32 stores. CVS Health will work working directly with Indiana and Ohio at their respective CVS Pharmacy locations to provide in-store vaccinations to eligible populations using state allocations. Other states in the US may choose the same option, which is separate from the federal pharmacy partnership program, but can still run simultaneously. CMS also reported in the announcement that its efforts to vaccinate residents of long-term care facilities remains on scheduled. In January, CVS Health [administered](https://cvshealth.com/news-and-insights/press-releases/cvs-health-completes-first-round-of-covid-19-vaccine-doses-at) the first round of COVID-19 vaccine doses to nearly 8,000 [skilled nursing facilities](https://ehrintelligence.com/news/skilled-nursing-facilities-lack-enhanced-patient-data-sharing) across the US, with the second dose underway and expected to be completed within four weeks. Allocations were based on long-term facility bed counts multiplied by two to account for staff, a CVS Health spokesperson noted. Colorado, Connecticut, Maine, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, North Dakota, Ohio, Puerto Rico, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming were the first states to receive COVID-19 vaccinations for assisted living and other facilities during the first week of January. Meanwhile, California, Florida, Georgia, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Mississippi, New York, Vermont, Virginia, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Alabama chose their COVID-19 activation dates for the middle of January. Assisted living facilities in Arizona, Indiana, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Maryland, Illinois, and Chicago received their vaccinations throughout the last week of January. The first doses at all long-term care facilities that selected CVS Health to provide COVID-19 vaccinations (over 40,000 in total) will be complete by mid-February. Nearly half of CVS' almost 10,000 locations nationwide are located in communities ranked high or very high in the CDC's Prevention Social Vulnerability Index. In November, HHS [announced](https://pharmanewsintel.com/news/hhs-partners-with-pharmacies-to-boost-access-to-covid-19-vaccines) the government's partnerships with large chain pharmacies and networks to boost access to COVID-19 vaccines across the US. Some of the most well-known pharmacies that signed up for the program so far include CVS, Costco, Wholesale, Publix, Rite Aid, Walgreens, Walmart, "}
