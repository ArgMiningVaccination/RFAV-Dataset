The results demonstrated that because phages have adjuvant properties and are safe for humans and animals, they are an excellent vaccine tool for protein and epitope immunization. The phage genome can easily be manipulated to display antigens or create DNA vaccines. Additionally, they are easy to produce on a large scale, which lowers their manufacturing costs. They are stable under various conditions, which can facilitate their transport and storage. However, no medicine regulatory agency has yet authorized phage-based vaccines despite the considerable preclinical data confirming their benefits. The skeptical perspective of phages should be overcome because humans encounter bacteriophages in their environment all the time without suffering adverse effects. The lack of clinical trials, endotoxin contamination, phage composition, and long-term negative effects are some obstacles preventing the development of phage vaccines. However, their prospects should be promising because phages are safe in clinical trials; they have been authorized as a food additive to avoid food contamination and approved for emergency use in phage therapy against difficult-to-treat antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Therefore, this encourages the use of phages in vaccines.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2023-02-14", "cleaned_text": "Aspects of Phage-Based Vaccines for Protein and Introduction [1](#B1-vaccines-11-00436)]. They have applications, e.g., in drug discovery [ [2](#B2-vaccines-11-00436), [3](#B3-vaccines-11-00436)], phage therapy [ [4](#B4-vaccines-11-00436)], vaccine development [ [5](#B5-vaccines-11-00436)], biocontrol of pathogens in food products [ [6](#B6-vaccines-11-00436)]. Phages can be a powerful tool for vaccine and antibody development since they are easy to produce and manipulate and can induce an immune response without adjuvants [ [5](#B5-vaccines-11-00436)]. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Search Strategy [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)(accessed on 5 January 2023)) using the keywords phage OR bacteriophage OR phage-based OR bacteriophage-based AND vaccine in the title/abstract. Articles published from 1 January 2017, to 15 December 2022, were analyzed. 2.2. Study Selection, Inclusion, and Exclusion Criteria 3. Results 3.1. Description of Phage-Based Vaccines [7](#B7-vaccines-11-00436)]. Currently, there are three types of vaccines based on bacteriophages: display, DNA, and hybrid vaccines [ [5](#B5-vaccines-11-00436), [8](#B8-vaccines-11-00436)]. In phage-displayed vaccines, the phages express proteins or protein subunits such as peptides with one coat protein or the antigens are chemically conjugate to the phage surfaces. Moreover, peptide screening using monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies from patients with a disease can reveal specific regions that can induce a neutralizing response [ [9](#B9-vaccines-11-00436), [10](#B10-vaccines-11-00436)]. In phage-based DNA vaccines, a gene fragment encoding a protein or a protein subunit is cloned into a eukaryotic cassette in a plasmid and then packed into phage particles. The phage particles are uptaken by target cells that express the antigen, leading to an immune response. The hybrid phage vaccine is a fusion of two types of phage vaccines. [11](#B11-vaccines-11-00436)]. In theory, any bacteriophage is suitable for phage-based vaccines, but they should meet some criteria to facilitate phage construction and production. The sequence of the phage genome and the genes encoding the capsid and tail proteins should be known and can be modified to promote the display of foreign antigens [ [12](#B12-vaccines-11-00436)]. The incorporation of the target sequence should not affect the phage stability and assembly. The phage bacterial host should be a nonpathogenic laboratory strain that can be used on a standard laboratory bench. Moreover, an alternative approach could be used, which applies to any bacteriophage, and antigens can be covalently linked to the bacteriophage surface by a chemical method such as the SpyCatcher system. However, the toxicity of untested bacteriophages should be analyzed first. One of the main reasons that E. coli phages are used for phage-based vaccines is that they are well-known, easy to use, and have already been tested in animal models and clinical trials [ [13](#B13-vaccines-11-00436)]. In addition, many well-developed tools and protocols are available for engineering these phages. The most common phages used in the selected studies were lambda, Q, T4, MS2, T7, AP205, 1](#vaccines-11-00436-t001). [14](#B14-vaccines-11-00436)]. Both the head protein pD and the tail protein pV can expose antigens on lambda [ [15](#B15-vaccines-11-00436), [16](#B16-vaccines-11-00436)]. Two capsid proteins (gp10A gp10B) make up the icosahedral head of T7. gp10B has been used in the first place since it is not required for the assembly of the capsid [ [17](#B17-vaccines-11-00436), [18](#B18-vaccines-11-00436), [19](#B19-vaccines-11-00436)]. [20](#B20-vaccines-11-00436)]. Given that Soc and Hoc are not necessary for phage infectivity, they have been used to express antigens on the surface of T4 [ [21](#B21-vaccines-11-00436), [22](#B22-vaccines-11-00436)]. [23](#B23-vaccines-11-00436)]. pVIII has been used to display peptides, while pIII to display larger fragments (scFv and Fab) in addition to peptides ( [Figure 1](#vaccines-11-00436-f001)). Due to the high copy number of pVIII on the phage surface (2700), pVIII is preferred to display multiple copies of an epitope in a phage-based vaccine. F8 is a filamentous bacteriophage similar to [ [24](#B24-vaccines-11-00436), [25](#B25-vaccines-11-00436)]. [26](#B26-vaccines-11-00436)]. Chemical conjugation and genetic fusion are the two main methods to display immunogenic antigens on VLPs [ [27](#B27-vaccines-11-00436)]. Q encodes a replicase), [ [28](#B28-vaccines-11-00436)] while MS2 has CP, A, L, and a replicase [ [29](#B29-vaccines-11-00436)]. In these two bacteriophages, antigens have been fused to their surface coat proteins to develop vaccines against HIV [ [30](#B30-vaccines-11-00436)] and drug addiction [ [31](#B31-vaccines-11-00436), [32](#B32-vaccines-11-00436)]. AP205 is a RNA (ssRNA) bacteriophage specific for Acinetobacter bacteria. This bacteriophage has 180 copies of the coat protein that allows both N- or C-terminal fusion of epitopes up to at least phage vector is composed of almost complete phage genome (e.g., M13), into which DNA encoding the desired antigen is introduced in the gene encoding a capsid protein (e.g., pVIII or pIII). The remaining portion of the phage genome typically remains untouched and generates the additional gene products required for the phage life cycle. The phage vectors allow multivalent expression of the target antigen, also displayed in fusion with every copy of the chosen capsid protein. A phagemid, on the other hand, is a plasmid that carries only the gene for one of the phage capsid proteins. Therefore, a helper phage (e.g., M13KO7 and VCSM13) must provide the remaining phage proteins for phage production. [53](#B53-vaccines-11-00436)]. The cleaned bacteriophages are dialyzed against sterile PBS after passing through a 0.4 m nitrocellulose filter. Other endotoxins removal methods could be used such as the one with organic solvents described by Szermer-Olearnik and Boratyski (2015) [ [54](#B54-vaccines-11-00436)]. 3.2. Safety of Phage-Based Vaccines for Humans and Animals [10](#B10-vaccines-11-00436)]. Bruttin and Br\u00fcssow did not record adverse outcomes in healthy adult volunteers that received low doses of E. coli phage T4 in their drinking water [ [55](#B55-vaccines-11-00436)]. A study by Algazi and colleagues evaluated the safety and efficacy of the phage vaccine SNS-301 along with pembrolizumab in people affected by chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). The results indicated that all doses of PAN-301-1 were safe, and no drug-related adverse events or dose-limiting toxicities occurred during the study [ [15](#B15-vaccines-11-00436)]. In another trial, fifteen patients with advanced multiple myeloma well-tolerated anticancer vaccine based on phage M13K07 [ [13](#B13-vaccines-11-00436)]. Sarkere et al. reported no adverse effects in healthy and diarrheal children from Bangladesh who received oral administration of T4-like coliphage cocktail preparations [ [56](#B56-vaccines-11-00436), [57](#B57-vaccines-11-00436)]. The phage study by Febvre and colleagues showed that oral administration of coliphages does not affect the fecal microbiota composition in healthy adults [ [58](#B58-vaccines-11-00436)]. [45](#B45-vaccines-11-00436)]. In another study, Q bacteriophage virus-like particles conjugated with a peptide corresponding to a region of the human L-type calcium channel (epitope CE12) had no adverse effects on immunized rats [ [46](#B46-vaccines-11-00436)]. [59](#B59-vaccines-11-00436)]. 3.3. Elicitation of the Immune Response by Phage-Based Vaccines [12](#B12-vaccines-11-00436)]. Antigen-presenting cells express toll-like receptors (TLR) that identify non-self antigens, such as phages at the early stages of the immune response [ [60](#B60-vaccines-11-00436)], which are internalized by these cells for maturation and presentation. Moreover, the peptides bind to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I or II, which are then identified by CD8+ or CD4+ T-cells, respectively [ [61](#B61-vaccines-11-00436)]. CD4+ can induce murine to proliferate and secrete immunoglobulin [ [64](#B64-vaccines-11-00436)], induce cytokines, stimulate natural killer cells, and elicit T-cell responses [ [65](#B65-vaccines-11-00436)]. [34](#B34-vaccines-11-00436)]. In the study by Ortega-Rivera et al., mice immunized with Q conjugated with the S protein peptides TESNKKFLPFQQFGRDIA, PSKPSKRSFIEDLLFNKV, HADQLTPTWRVY produced high-level IgG antibodies, while animals vaccinated with free S protein peptides did not [ [47](#B47-vaccines-11-00436)]. Li and colleagues found that whereas the proteins of influenza virus 3M2e displayed on T4 nanoparticles, without any adjuvant, elicited of 3M2e-specific IgG antibodies, 3M2e conjugated to RB69 low levels of 3M2e-specific IgG antibodies [ [38](#B38-vaccines-11-00436)]. In addition, the 58 amino acid peptide of the Pfs47 antigen of P. high level of antibodies [ [51](#B51-vaccines-11-00436)]. VLPs of bacteriophage Q displaying the target peptides PCKS9, ApoB, and CETP induced higher antibody titers in mice against the antigen than the free peptides [ [66](#B66-vaccines-11-00436)]. 3.4. Phage-Base Vaccines in Clinical Trials [50](#B50-vaccines-11-00436)]. This study ended on 25 February 2022, but no results have been published at clinical trials.gov. In addition, an open-label phase two trial (NCT05077267; EUCTR2021-001393-31) is ongoing with ABNCoV2 in Germany. A phase three trial (NCT05329220) evaluated the immunogenicity, safety, and tolerability of ABNCoV2 in adults previously vaccinated with SARS-CoV-2. [15](#B15-vaccines-11-00436)]. 3.5. Approved Phage-Based Vaccines [68](#B68-vaccines-11-00436)]. [69](#B69-vaccines-11-00436)]. In addition, phagebank therapy in COVID-19 patients with suspected or proven secondary bacterial infections received FDA approval under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) [ [70](#B70-vaccines-11-00436)]. Several case reports have described the use of phages to treat persistent bacterial infections after multiple failures of antibiotic treatments [ [71](#B71-vaccines-11-00436), [72](#B72-vaccines-11-00436), [73](#B73-vaccines-11-00436), [74](#B74-vaccines-11-00436), [75](#B75-vaccines-11-00436), [76](#B76-vaccines-11-00436), [77](#B77-vaccines-11-00436), [78](#B78-vaccines-11-00436)]. encouraging since this could indicate that bacteriophages may be safe in other medical applications, including in phage-based vaccines, without being a risk to people or animals [ [79](#B79-vaccines-11-00436)]. 3.6. Advantages and Disadvantages of Phage-Based Vaccines [80](#B80-vaccines-11-00436)] and trigger a strong humoral and cellular immune response. Therefore, adjuvants are not required [ [81](#B81-vaccines-11-00436)]. They do not need to be produced in cell culture systems and can be easily converted for mass production using basic bacteriological media [ [82](#B82-vaccines-11-00436)]. Phage-based vaccines could be a simple, time- and cost-efficient vaccination approach [ [13](#B13-vaccines-11-00436)]. Bacteriophages may also be applied to oral vaccination due to their physical stability in the gastrointestinal tract [ [83](#B83-vaccines-11-00436)]. Phages have a significant potential for use as vaccine carriers for various illnesses, including cancer and infectious diseases, which are listed in [Table 2](#vaccines-11-00436-t002)[ [12](#B12-vaccines-11-00436), [84](#B84-vaccines-11-00436)]. Viral particles are remarkably stable in many challenging environmental conditions (pH and temperature) [ [10](#B10-vaccines-11-00436)]. These characteristics make administration, storage, and transportation easy [ [8](#B8-vaccines-11-00436)]. For instance, some stability tests revealed that T4 was stable for at least ten weeks at room temperature. Therefore, a cold chain is not required to distribute vaccines based on T4 [ [40](#B40-vaccines-11-00436)]. Phage DNA vaccines allow gene expression and protein folding in eukaryotic cells, and the eukaryotic expression cassette is protected from degradation [ [85](#B85-vaccines-11-00436)]. [84](#B84-vaccines-11-00436)]. In addition, the antigen size can be a limitation because it is unlikely that large protein subunits could be displayed on phage particles. However, this is solved by conjugating the phages with these large antigens. Additionally, for the phage DNA vaccines, the genome length must be within the virion packaging limits [ [86](#B86-vaccines-11-00436)]. The lack of an immunological response to self or harmful antigens may also be a barrier [ [87](#B87-vaccines-11-00436)]. Another disadvantage is that few clinical trials support the efficacy of phage-based vaccines, and more efforts must convert the results from preclinical investigations to clinical trials. [59](#B59-vaccines-11-00436)] or derived from the host bacteria and culture media, can contaminate the production of phage-based vaccines. Endotoxins are also the hydrophobic moiety of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which makes up the outer monolayer of the outer membranes of most gram-negative bacteria [ [88](#B88-vaccines-11-00436)]. Endotoxins can be an issue since even slight exposure can trigger pro-inflammatory reactions [ [88](#B88-vaccines-11-00436)] and lead to toxic shock, cell damage, and the production of cytokines [ [89](#B89-vaccines-11-00436)]. Due to these effects, the generated phage stock must undergo a procedure to remove endotoxins before they can be used in vaccines. This can be minimized using lysogenic phages, such as filamentous phages (e.g., M13, fd, and f1), instead of lytic phages and implementing good manufacturing practice (GMP) [ [90](#B90-vaccines-11-00436)] in an early stage of the product development to meet regulatory requirements [ [91](#B91-vaccines-11-00436)]. The removal of endotoxins from bacterial cultures can be done using many techniques, such as triton X-114 separation [ [53](#B53-vaccines-11-00436)] and organic solvents [ [54](#B54-vaccines-11-00436)]. The triton X-114 separation worked quickly and effectively to prepare M13 phage-based vaccine by lowering the endotoxin concentration to less than one unit/mL, which was used in patients with advanced multiple myeloma participating in a clinical phase I/II trial. The triton X-114 treated phage vaccination was well-tolerated in the patients, with the only minor side effects being flu-like symptoms and skin irritation at the injection site SARS-CoV-2 [106](#B106-vaccines-11-00436)]. The RBD plays a role in the binding of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE-2, allowing the virus to enter the host cells [ [107](#B107-vaccines-11-00436)]. Moreover, antibodies can neutralize this attachment by competing with ACE-2 for binding to RBD. Therefore, the spike (S) protein is the main target to develop a phage-based vaccine. [34](#B34-vaccines-11-00436)]. [108](#B108-vaccines-11-00436), [109](#B109-vaccines-11-00436)]. Immunized mice produced higher levels of specific IgG after the first injection with S1- VLP than mice injected with S1 alone. However, the levels of these antibodies were almost equal after the second injection due to the presence of AddaVax, an MF59-like oil-in-water emulsion. Their sera could inhibit two UK/B.1.1.7) vitro [ [67](#B67-vaccines-11-00436)]. [110](#B110-vaccines-11-00436)]. Mice immunized with phages displaying S protein epitope generated a robust antibody response to the S protein. This study demonstrated that the pulmonary delivery of vaccines using a lung transport peptide can trigger both local and systemic immune responses [ [92](#B92-vaccines-11-00436)]. [86](#B86-vaccines-11-00436)]. [40](#B40-vaccines-11-00436)]. [39](#B39-vaccines-11-00436)]. 3.7.2. Influenza A Virus [111](#B111-vaccines-11-00436)]. New vaccines against the Flu were developed using a platform based on T4 phages. Peptides consisting of twenty-three amino acids from the amino terminal part of the extracellular domain of influenza matrix protein 2 (3M2e) from human, swine, and avian influenza viruses were displayed on phage outer capsid protein (Soc), forming the 3M2e-T4 VLP vaccine [ [38](#B38-vaccines-11-00436)]. This vaccine given intramuscularly to mice without any adjuvant triggered strong cell- and antibody-mediated immune responses. The produced antibodies were specific and highly immunogenic against M2e on influenza virions and virus-infected cells, which protected mice challenged with the H1N1 virus. These experiments demonstrate the feasibility of the phage T4 VLP platform to develop the has four proteins in its capsid (VP1-4), of which one of them (VP1) has an RGD sequence in its G-H loop that mediates attachment to the integrin. This loop has a major antigenic epitope capable of FMDV-specific neutralizing antibodies [ [113](#B113-vaccines-11-00436)]. Phage-based vaccine against FMDV was constructed by displaying a fragment corresponding to residues 131-160 of VP1 on the surface of the MS2 phage, which was termed the chimeric nanoparticle (CNPs) vaccine. Mice immunized with CNPs generated higher specific antibodies against VP1 and increased the cellular immune response much more than the control peptides. These findings showed that the CNPs developed for the current investigation might serve as a viable replacement vaccination for FMDV control in the future [ [48](#B48-vaccines-11-00436)]. In another study, bacteriophage T7 was used to design vaccines to prevent infections from several types of viruses, including influenza A and FMDV. VP1 was displayed on phage T7 generating the vaccine AKT-T7, which was not toxic to sheep kidney-, BHK-21-, or MDBK-cells. The immunized mice developed high levels of FMDV antibodies that could be sustained over time. Furthermore, the animals produced significant amounts of IFN- in mice while having minimal effect on IL-4 [ [36](#B36-vaccines-11-00436)]. 3.7.5. Zika Virus [114](#B114-vaccines-11-00436)], Phage-based vaccine was developed by B-cell epitopes of the ZIKV E protein on VLPs of bacteriophage Q. Immunized mice with phages with a single epitope generated antibodies against ZIKV. However, these antibodies only protect against a small viral inoculum. In contrast, a cocktail of phages displaying different B-cell epitopes of ZIKV E not only triggered a strong antibody response but also neutralized the viral infection at higher doses. As a result, vaccination with various VLPs exhibiting numerous ZIKV B-cell epitopes is an effective technique for increasing ZIKV neutralization [ [115](#B115-vaccines-11-00436)]. 3.8. Phage-Based Vaccines against Bacterial Infections 3.8.1. Chlamydia trachomatis [116](#B116-vaccines-11-00436)]. CT584 is a protein linked with the type three secretion system (T3SS) that plays a role in invasion, intracellular survival, and exit from cells [ [117](#B117-vaccines-11-00436)]. CT584 forms part of a vaccine composed of three proteins that induce the production of neutralizing antibodies that protect against C. trachomatis [ [118](#B118-vaccines-11-00436)]. Moreover, the immunogenicity and effectiveness of the phage-base vaccine in preventing C. trachomatis infections were evaluated. Epitopes 70-77 and 154-164 of CT584 were chemically conjugated to bacteriophage forming the Q-CT584 vaccine. Mice immunized intramuscularly with Q-CT584 and then challenged with C. trachomatis, produced high levels of IgG against CT584 that protected them from infection. CT584 antibodies were also found at the site of mouse infection. Moreover, the pre-incubation of C. trachomatis with sera from mice immunized with Q-CT584 reduced the number of bacterial cells in the upper genital tract of challenged animals. Surprisingly, sera from women affected by urogenital C. trachomatis infection did not identify the CT584 epitopes employed in the vaccine. However, species-specific differences in immunogenicity between humans and mice require further investigation [ [94](#B94-vaccines-11-00436)]. A transmembrane protein called MOMP, for major outer membrane protein, has four variable domains exposed to the surface and five constant domains (VDs). MOMP has a highly conserved epitope (TTLNPTIAG) in The phage-based vaccine was developed by selecting phages from a peptide library with E4 mAb. An alternative was to express the TTLNPTIAG epitope on the surface of the VLPs of bacteriophage MS2. In a mouse challenge model, mice immunized with MS2 VLPs generated IgG that identified C. trachomatis and gave protection against vaginal against V. designed by chemically connecting the antigen O-specific polysaccharide (OSP), recovered from V. cholerae O1 El Tor Inaba to VLP derived from phage Q. Immunizing mice with the Q-OSP formula induced high and long-lasting levels of IgG antibodies against OSP, and the resultant antibodies recognized the natural LPS from V. cholerae O1 El Tor Inaba. Additionally, antibodies from sera from immunized mice with complements could lyse the live bacteria [ [96](#B96-vaccines-11-00436)]. 3.8.4. Bordetella pertussis [122](#B122-vaccines-11-00436)]. Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are part of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, exhibiting endotoxic activities [ [123](#B123-vaccines-11-00436)] that make them attractive antigens to develop vaccines against B. pertussis. The LPS of B. pertussis includes lipid A coupled to dodeca-saccharide [ [124](#B124-vaccines-11-00436)] that are recognized by monoclonal antibodies, suggesting that it may be a suitable epitope target in vaccines [ [125](#B125-vaccines-11-00436)]. Phage-based vaccine against B. pertussis was developed by conjugating this pentasaccharide to the bacteriophage Q (Q-glycan). Immunization of mice with Q-glycan induced robust and long-lasting anti-glycan IgG that could recognize native LPS on the bacterial surface [ [97](#B97-vaccines-11-00436)]. 3.9. Phage-Based Vaccines cysteine proteases that induce parasite penetration into host tissues. Therefore, they might be a good vaccine target against this parasite. Different mimotopes of CL1 and CL2 displayed on phage M13KE were used as vaccine candidates against F. hepatic. Goats vaccinated with phages with the mimotopes DPWWLKQ of CL1, and PPIRNGK of CL2 with Quil A adjuvant generated high levels of Ig1 and Ig2 isotypes specific for CL1 and CL2. Compared with unvaccinated goats, all three mimotopes dramatically reduced the number of parasites when the immunized goats were challenged with F. hepatica metacercariae. The mimotope CL1 reduced infection more effectively (by more than 70%) than the other two mimotopes. Additionally, phage immunization reduced fecal egg production, egg viability, and total parasite biomass [ [42](#B42-vaccines-11-00436)]. In another study, the mimotopes TPWKDKQ of CL1 and YGSCFLR of CL2 induced high levels of IgG antibodies against CL1 and CL2. Compared with the control group, the CL1 vaccine gave 57.58% protection. However, CL2 or a combination of CL1 and CL2 had no significant effect in immunized animals (33.14% and 11.63%, respectively). Animals receiving CL2 have much lower parasite egg production [ [127](#B127-vaccines-11-00436)]. The mimotopes SGTFLFS and WHVPRTWWVLPP of CL1 and the immunodominant E/S displayed on phages induced the production of IgG1, IgG2, and IFN but reduced the levels of IL-4. The results indicated that the amino acids in the center and C-terminal end of the linear sequence are involved in the protection of sheep challenged with metacercariae of F. hepatic [ [98](#B98-vaccines-11-00436)]. 3.9.3. Plasmodium falciparum [128](#B128-vaccines-11-00436)]. Pfs47 is a 6-cysteine protein associated with the surface of Plasmodium gametes and mediates parasite evasion of the mosquito immune system, therefore, a potential vaccine target [ [129](#B129-vaccines-11-00436)]. A phage-based vaccine called VLP-P47 was designed by conjugating a fifty-eight amino acid peptide from domain two of Pfs47 to AP205 VLP using the SpyCatcher. This study demonstrated that the VLP-P47 vaccine was more immunogenic than the unconjugated P47. BALB/c mice immunized intramuscularly with resulted antibody titers than natural Pfs47 or unconjugated P47. These antibodies have high (83-98%) transmission-reducing activity (TRA), which indicates a level of reduction in oocysts compared to controls [ [51](#B51-vaccines-11-00436)]. 3.10. Phage-Based Vaccines against Yeast Infections [130](#B130-vaccines-11-00436)]. Fructose-bisphosphate aldolase 1 (Fba1) is a cell wall protein that is a potential anti-fungal target because yeast needs it for its growth [ [131](#B131-vaccines-11-00436)]. Previously, it was shown that the peptide from Fba1 protected from candidiasis [ [132](#B132-vaccines-11-00436), [133](#B133-vaccines-11-00436)]. Phage-based vaccine against albicans was developed by displaying the Fba1 epitope YGKDVKDLFDYAQE on coat and phage-8F generated humoral and cellular immune responses. The vaccine reduces fungal infection, relieves kidney damage in infected mice, and notably improves their survival rates [ [99](#B99-vaccines-11-00436)]. 3.11. Phage-Based Vaccines against Cancer 3.11.1. Breast Cancer [134](#B134-vaccines-11-00436)]. However, anti-HER2 monoclonal antibodies help increase the overall survival of patients with HER2-positive breast cancer [ [135](#B135-vaccines-11-00436)]. Therefore, HER2 is a vaccine target against this disease. A phage-based vaccine platform was developed by displaying HER2 and its variant 16HER2 on M13 phages, fused with 16HER2 transgenic mice HER2-phage or 16HER2-phage. Moreover, vaccination with anti-HER2 phage-based vaccines could control breast cancer growth in 16HER2 mice. Anti-HER2 antibodies from immune sera impairing extracellular signal-regulated kinase in [ [43](#B43-vaccines-11-00436)]. A highly immunogenic peptide transmembrane domain (654-662: IISAVVGIL) of HER2/neu protein was expressed in fusion with the capsid protein (gpD) in bacteriophage lambda. BALB/c mice were immunized with phages displaying GP2. The vaccine induced significant secretion of IFN- in the mice and cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity in a mouse tumor model over-expressing HER2/neu. It has a prophylactic effect by significantly reducing the growth rate of the tumor and prolonging survival compared with the control group. The GP2 phage-based vaccine has a therapeutic effect in a BALB/c mouse xenograft tumor model by efficiently inhibiting tumor growth and prolonging survival [ [100](#B100-vaccines-11-00436)]. In another study, phage lambda displaying the E75 peptide from HER2, named F7, was used to immunize mice in an implantable TUBO breast tumor model. Vaccinated and unvaccinated animals developed tumors in in vivo prophylactic experiments. In the therapeutic analysis, however, there was a substantial difference in tumor growth between mice inoculated with F7 and control groups. Furthermore, mice inoculated with F7 had longer survival periods [ [35](#B35-vaccines-11-00436)]. [136](#B136-vaccines-11-00436)]. Phage-based vaccine against metastatic breast cancer (MBC) was developed by displaying an extracellular loop of xCT on VLPs of the bacteriophage MS2 (AX09). Mice immunized with AX09 produced high levels of specific antibodies against xCT. The sera from these animals reduced the number and size of the tumors, cystine uptake, and migration of breast cancer cells in vitro. In breast cancer models, AX09 immunization suppresses the generation of lung metastases and tumor progression [ [101](#B101-vaccines-11-00436)]. 3.11.2. Other Types of Cancer [137](#B137-vaccines-11-00436)]. [138](#B138-vaccines-11-00436)]. A previous study showed that vaccination with the extracellular domain of murine EGFR reduced lung metastasis in mice challenged with tumor cells [ [139](#B139-vaccines-11-00436)]. The extracellular domain L2 of EGFR was expressed as a fusion peptide with pVIII protein on the surface of M13 phages. BALB/c mice immunized with the phage-based vaccine generated high titers of antibodies against EGFR L2 compared with the control groups. The prophylactic and therapeutic anticancer effects of the EGFR L2 vaccine were evaluated in a mouse tumor model. The results showed that this vaccine could reduce the tumor growth rate in immunized mice. Because the study was conducted on a few animals, it should be expanded to a larger number to obtain more solid and definitive results [ [140](#B140-vaccines-11-00436)]. [141](#B141-vaccines-11-00436)]. GD2 has been studied as a candidate for an anticancer vaccine, but it is weakly immunogenic [ [142](#B142-vaccines-11-00436)]. Additionally, acetylated GD2 may be used in vaccines due the hydroxyl groups of gangliosides may be acetylated in nature [ [143](#B143-vaccines-11-00436)]. Anticancer phage-based vaccine was developed by conjugating a GD2 derivative bearing an N-acetamide at the C-9 position (9NHAc-GD2) to bacteriophage Q. After being inoculated with the Q-9NHAc-GD2 vaccine, mice developed robust and long-lasting IgG antibodies that were highly specific for 9NHAc-GD2 with limited cross-recognition of GD2. Canine immunotherapy with Q-9NHAc-GD2 revealed that the phage vaccine was immunogenic in dogs and not toxic [ [102](#B102-vaccines-11-00436)]. [144](#B144-vaccines-11-00436)]. The extracellular domain of MUC1 contains a variable region of twenty amino acid tandem repeats (HGVSTAPDTRPAPGSTAPPA) with five potential O-glycosylation sites that become exposed in cancer cells [ [145](#B145-vaccines-11-00436)]. Clinical investigations show that the presence of MUC1 antibodies is related to a better prognosis of the disease. However, there is currently no effective MUC1 vaccine [ [146](#B146-vaccines-11-00436)]. Phage-based vaccine for anticancer the bacteriophage Q-MUC1. Immunized MUC1 transgenic mice with the Q-MUC1 vaccine produced high levels of antibodies against MUC1, exhibiting tumor protection in metastasis and solid tumor models. Antibodies from sera from Q-MUC1 immunized mice recognized tissues from human breast cancer but not from normal human breasts [ [103](#B103-vaccines-11-00436)]. [147](#B147-vaccines-11-00436)]. Phage-based vaccine against cancer cells were developed by expressing neoepitopes from mutated proteins of B16-F10 melanoma tumor cells. In mice, a dose of phage-peptide vaccines elicits a high immune response. Induced antibodies bound to the mutant peptides more strongly than the equivalent not mutated peptides. In comparison with uninfected mouse nodes, next-generation sequencing (NGS) of lymph node cells revealed poor B-cell receptor diversity and clonal hyperpolarization in vaccine-draining lymph nodes. Following immunization, the NGS data indicated a rise in IgG and other class-switched antibodies. These findings agree with previous data on plasma IgG antibodies against peptides on T7 phages that recognize whole B16-F10 cells [ [37](#B37-vaccines-11-00436)]. 3.12. Phage-Based Vaccines against Other Types of Diseases or Conditions [148](#B148-vaccines-11-00436)], causing Tauopathies. Therefore, Tau may be a good target in a vaccine against these diseases. A phage-based vaccine against Tauopathies (pT181-Q) was developed by conjugating a from pT181) bacteriophage Tauopathy-prone transgenic rTg4510 and non-transgenic mice vaccinated with pT181-Q generated a robust IgG response against pT181. These antibodies could detect classical somatodendritic pTau+ in the brains of FTD but not in the brain sections of healthy controls. The pTau accumulated in the hippocampus and cortex was reduced in pT181-Q vaccinated mice. Neuroinflammation and circulating CD3+ T-cells in the brain were also reduced [ [104](#B104-vaccines-11-00436)]. [149](#B149-vaccines-11-00436)], and the human L-type calcium channel (CaV1.2) is the most prominent voltage-gated channel type that regulates Ca2+ influx in vascular smooth muscle. Changes in CaV1.2's molecular structure and function generate vascular dysfunction and hypertension [ [150](#B150-vaccines-11-00436)]. A phage-based vaccine for treating hypertension was created by coupling the epitope of the E3 region domain IV (CE12) of CaV1.2 to VLPs of the bacteriophage Q. The Q-CE12 vaccination successfully elicited anti-CE12 antibodies, reducing blood pressure in hypertensive animals. Moreover, these antibodies recognize CaV1.2, blocking its function. Additionally, there was no evidence of adverse effects [ [46](#B46-vaccines-11-00436)]. [151](#B151-vaccines-11-00436)]. Also, four subtypes of histamine receptors (e.g., H1, H2, H3, and H4) have been reported so far. The blockage of the histamine H4 receptor (H4R) reduces AR symptoms and inflammation in animal models of AR [ [85](#B85-vaccines-11-00436)]. A phage-based vaccine against AR was developed by phage M13. library using an affinity-purified anti-H4R antibody. Immunized rats with the P-FN12 vaccine induced the production of anti-H4R antibodies. The IgE and IL-4 levels decreased but increased the interferon (IFN)- and interleukin-2 (IL-2) levels in immunized rats. Additionally, the vaccine lowers the proportion of Th1/Th2 cells in PBMCs and inhibits the infiltration of eosinophils in the nasal mucosa. P-FN12 is a promising vaccine for treating AR [ [105](#B105-vaccines-11-00436)]. [152](#B152-vaccines-11-00436)]. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol or LDL-C is associated with an increased risk of CVDs [ [153](#B153-vaccines-11-00436)] and comprises three proteins (e.g., PCSK9, ApoB, and CETP) that are checkpoint proteins. A phage-based vaccine was developed by displaying these three proteins on the coat protein VLPs of bacteriophage Q. The phage-based vaccines were prepared in hot melt-extrusion to ensure a slow-release. Immunized ApoB, and CETP. Additionally, the vaccines reduce the levels of these proteins, thus, decreasing the total cholesterol in the plasma [ [66](#B66-vaccines-11-00436)]. [154](#B154-vaccines-11-00436)]. GnRH has been used in vaccine formulations, which limit reproduction and decrease sex hormone synthesis in various mammalian species, including cats, over lengthy periods [ [155](#B155-vaccines-11-00436)]. A phage-based vaccine to control fertility in cats was selected from an f8-8 landscape phage display library with neutralizing GnRH antibodies [ [44](#B44-vaccines-11-00436)]. The cats vaccinated with phage-GnRH produced high levels of antibodies against GnRH, decreasing their serum testosterone levels and reducing their total testicular volume, indicating gonadal atrophy. Moreover, all cats generated sperm at the end of the trial. However, their normal morphology was reduced by up to 38%. These results demonstrate that the phage-based vaccination against GnRH may be used to suppress cat fertility [ [45](#B45-vaccines-11-00436)]. 4. Discussion [156](#B156-vaccines-11-00436), [157](#B157-vaccines-11-00436)]. Despite the excellent phage vaccine characteristics and substantial preclinical data, the FDA and EMA have not yet approved any bacteriophage vaccines. [26](#B26-vaccines-11-00436)]. Another factor that probably meets resistance to the acceptance of phages in vaccines is that phages can kill bacteria and could kill bacteria from the human flora. However, there are data from a human trial showing that phages do not affect the human flora and that oral administration of phages is safe [ [58](#B58-vaccines-11-00436)]. In addition, the natural microbial community of the human gut is frequently exposed to bacteriophages in high concentrations through food, water, and the environment without causing any harm to people [ [68](#B68-vaccines-11-00436)]. Another issue that can create concern and probably skepticism towards approving phage-based vaccines is endotoxin contamination during phage production and its secondary effects. However, there are effective protocols to remove endotoxins like the one used by Roehnisch et al., 2014 [ [13](#B13-vaccines-11-00436)]. They demonstrated that their M13-based vaccine was well-tolerated by fifteen patients with advanced multiple myeloma, with only modest and temporary side effects, such as flu-like symptoms and skin irritability at the injection site. The use of phages for medical purposes, such as phage therapy, was long resisted by the Western world, but this has started to change. New technologies, therefore, undergo a protracted and slow process before being accepted and authorized if they meet the standards for safety and efficacy, especially those designed for clinical application. [13](#B13-vaccines-11-00436)], should be a good starting point to increase phage-based vaccines in clinical trials, at least those based on M13 that have shown to be safe. This perspective is encouraging because the above may indicate that the application of phages in vaccines could be authorized in the future.
