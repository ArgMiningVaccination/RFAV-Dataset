Athens is an unusual city in that it is home to beautiful ancient ruins surrounded by streets packed with hurried cars and motorbikes, walls and shops plagued with graffiti, and tourists roaming the sidewalks. This couldn't be more of a contrast to what was in store for us on the island of Ikaria. Warm smiles. Clear water. Delicious foods. Natural beauty. Quiet. Brilliant stars. Charm. Ikaria had more surprises and secrets to offer than I imagined. Our time in the village of Nas on the island of Ikaria provided many opportunities to learn about the life and culture of the island, many of which we hope you read in our blog. But what made the experience truly special was the people. The people we met along the way - truly strangers to us\u2014made us feel welcome, connected, happy, inspired, and grateful. By their example, we learned to not live by the clock, put down our cell phones, reflect on our relationships, and found permission to relax and simply enjoy. Ikarians showed happiness and contentment, evidenced by constant smiles, laughter, and socialization with family and friends. They embraced life, exuded it! They knew their purpose and set out each day to accomplish it. Returning home, I think each of us carry a piece of the island\u2014its beauty, people and lifestyle. Having the opportunity to travel to Ikaria (something not even many Greeks are able to do), I hope we all feel compelled to share our experience with our family, friends, and communities, helping them to achieve happiness and health unlike what they have previously known. Thank you, Ikaria, for opening our eyes and giving us gifts to help change the world. "}
