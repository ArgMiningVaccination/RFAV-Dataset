TCM Nutrition Basics The goal of TCM nutrition is to keep the body in a neutral state by eating the proper foods at the proper times in proper amounts. The most natural way of all to boost our immune system is through food, and in TCM, this has been a well-known fact for thousands of years.

Top 3 TCM Nutrition Tips: - Although raw foods have more nutrients compared to cooked foods on a molecular level, they are also harder to break down within the stomach. Lightly cooked is best to get everything that we need from the foods we eat. - The temperature of the food being consumed is important. Having cold food and drinks in general is not the best for digestion. Having food and drink that is room temperature is preferrable. - A common problem, especially in the United States, is dampness from foods that backs us up. This dampness comes from hard to digest foods like refined sugar and dairy. Have a patient cut out these types of foods, and they will be surprised at the change in their health issues. Essentially, TCM does not want to make the stomach's job harder and disrupt digestion in the body. The goal is to encourage self-healing through boosting the immune system. Additionally, patients should consume food that is grown locally as much as possible, while eating foods that are appropriate with the seasons. For patients to maintain immunity, especially in colder months when sickness is more common, they should take increase their intake of fresh vegetables, seeds, nuts, grains, water, meat and fish, and a small amount of oil. Common signs that a patient has a compromised immune system are chronic fatigue, chronic skin conditions like inflammation or allergies, frequent colds or body aches, and digestive issues. A tongue diagnosis would reveal teeth marks or scallop outline and greasy coating when a patient is showing a weak immune system.
