It took less than a moment and she knew this was the start of something pivotal! As an apprentice makeup artist working with drag stars and performers in the Manhattan cabaret scene, life was about covering up and enhancing \"the look\" vs. proper skincare to achieve the ultimate natural beauty. Hours of makeup application became the literal foundation of her knowledge - seeing the result of endless layers of stage makeup without proper skincare was the edge that she needed to propel and further her interest in the world of beauty - specifically the science of skin and ultimately skincare! Within the multi-channeled beauty industry and its' every changing landscape, Chandra knew that education was her guiding principle and the key to her future success. Esthetics to her was not just an art, it was an art of science and skin. She continued her studies with the wellness movement and was one of the pioneers evangelizing the concept of blending eastern and western methodologies in the treatment room for ultimate results. Over the next 30 years, Bredel studied science and skincare formulation while honing her esthetic skills in the treatment room with some of the most sought after dermatologists and cosmetic surgeons - a dynamic career in the beauty industry was in the making. Today she is an accomplished esthetician, international esthetic educator, published author, product development consultant and connoisseur of all things beauty - from ingredients and formulation to final product- she is known as an the Esty's best friend and the Geek4Beauty in the social circles.

She is highly sought after professional speaker for TV, medical conferences and aesthetics tradeshows. She has appeared on Oprah, as well as a skincare expert on local stations, such as FOX, NBC and ABC affiliates. Pamela began her career in the beauty industry as a National Training Director for a major skincare company. She soon discovered the industry's lack of information on the skin care needs of the ethnic market. This encouraged her to complete her licensing goals as an Aesthetician and also, as an Aesthetics Instructor. Though her initial training in aesthetics allowed her to know the skin and its treatments of various skin conditions, there was no training in the nuances of ethnic skins. Searching for this training, she was introduced to a well-known board certified dermatologist and medical school professor who specialized in Ethno Dermatology and was given a 9-month internship. Pamela realized the importance of this untapped market and founded The Skin & Makeup Institute of Arizona, offering studies in the anomalies seen in skin of color. In 2009, Springer introduced Global Skin Solutions, a corrective PRO skin care product line. Global Skin Solutions is formulated to reflect the unique challenges consumers face in today's diverse ethnic market.

My love for beauty started very early on, from watching my Mom (who sold Avon on the side) get ready for work every morning, never leaving the house without eye-shadow and lipstick (still to this day), to making sure her hair and nails were/are done every two weeks. My mom showed me the importance of self-care and self-maintenance, and despite all the hours she worked, she still found time to make sure she looked and felt good. I studied Criminal Justice at Temple University, but after 4 years of studies, I realized that was not my passion. I swiftly changed course and applied to be a Flight Attendant where I also spent 4 years before realizing again, I still haven't found my passion. Fast forward a few months, I found myself working part-time at a Lash Salon as a receptionist. Watching the girls work and seeing how happy the clients were, I then had my \"AH-HA!\" moment. My passion was to make people happy and to make people feel amazing about themselves. I realized through the Beauty Industry I could do just that. I could help others, just like my mom. I enrolled at The Jean Madeline Aveda Institute, where I earned my Esthiology diploma and went on to take my state boards to become a Licensed Esthetician in PA. Now every day I wake up, I get to say that I am doing something I love. Something that matters. More importantly, something that empowers people. I have found passion in one of the most rewarding industries, and I am beyond thrilled to share that passion with you all. My goal is to bring comprehensive skincare and product education to all of my clients so that while both in the treatment room and at home they feel confident in their self-care routine and life. My passion from teaching comes from my love of sharing my knowledge and life experiences to help inspire others to do the same.
