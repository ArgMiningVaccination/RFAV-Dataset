Properly and responsibly managing acute pain is desirable not only because it relieves patient suffering, but because it reduces the chances that acute pain will morph into chronic pain, and responsi ble prescribing can help stem the tide of opioid diversion, misuse, and abuse. Opioids do, of course, play an invaluable role in the management of acute pain, but they carry important risks, as well, and thus are generally viewed as second -line agents or to be used only as part of a multi -modal approach. The risks of opioids, even when used for acute pain and for relatively short durations, are amplified among older adults, patients with impaired renal or hepatic function, those with COPD, cardiopulmonary disorders, sleep apnea, or mental illness, and in anyone likely to combine opiates with other respiratory depressants such as alcohol or benzodiazepines.3 This white paper summarizes the current evidence for optimal management of acute pain , with the key recommend ations being : Assess the degree of expected or actual pain from an injury, surgery, or procedure Consider patient -related and drug -related factors related to pain and pain relief Use multimodal pain control methods, emphasizing, when appropriate, non - pharmacological methods and non -opioid pharmacotherapy If opioids are deemed necessary , prescribe only an amount to cover the expected pain or realistic duration of time to a follow -up appointment oCheck PDMP AWARxE, South Dakota's prescription drug monitoring program . oScreen for risk factors such as history of substance abuse disorder or men tal illness . oPrescribe only short -acting opioids . oDiscuss with storage, use, and disposal of opioids . oTaper or discontinue opioids as soon as possible . oRe-evaluate patients if healing does not follow the expected course . Although the practices described in these guidelines are intended to apply broadly, they are not intended to establish a \"standard of care.\" P roviders - to include all prescribers - must exercise their own 27best medical judgment when providing treatment, taking all relevant circumstances into account, including the potential for abuse, diversion and risk for addiction. 28Introduction As unpleasant as it is, a cute pain serves an important adaptive biological purpose: it alerts us to internal or external damage or dysfunction in our bodies. Acute pain can provoke a range of protective reflexes (e.g., withdrawal of a damaged limb, muscle spasm, autonomic response s) that can help the body heal. Even brief episodes of acute pain , however, can induce suffering, neuronal remodeling, and can set the stage for chronic pain.4 Associated behaviors (e.g., bracing, abnormal postures, excessive reclining) may further contribute to the development of chronic pain. An e xample of this phenomenon is persistent postsurgical pain (PPP), which is pain persisting beyond the expected healing period. Many common operations (e.g., mastectomy, thoracotomy, hernia repair, coronary artery bypass surgery) are associated with an inci dence of PPP of up to 30 -50 percent .5 The intensity of perioperative and postoperative pain is estimated to contribute about 20 percent of the overall risk for transition from acute pain to PPP.6 In addition to the purely humanitarian value of reducing or eliminating acute pain , therefore, effectively and aggressively treating acute pain may reduce complications and progression to chronic pain states.7 Acute pain is a multidimens ional experience that usually occur s in response to tissue trauma, and although responses to acute pain may be adaptive, they can have adverse physiologic and psychological consequences (e.g., reduced tidal volume, excessive stress response, or inability to comply with rehabilitation). Acute pain is more difficult to manage if permitted to become severe, so prompt and adequate treatment of acute pain is imperative , with the basic goals of: Early intervention, with prompt adjustments in the regim en for inadequately controlled pain Reduction of pain to acceptable levels Facilitation of recovery from underlying disease or injury Although much attention has been paid in the past decade to the range of problematic issues related to opioid analgesics and chronic pain, many similar issues can be at work in the treatment of acute pain. For example, a number of studies demonstrate increased risk of new persistent opioid use in opioid - na\u00efve patients after having been prescribed opioids for acute pain.8-11 Although the risk of opioid misuse in patients prescribed opioids for acute post -surgical or post -procedural pain is relatively small (roughly 0.6 percent ), the volume of such procedures (approximately 48 million ambulatory surgeries or procedures in 20 10) translates into large numbers of p atients (i.e., approximately 160,000) who may develop dependence, abuse, or overdose every year.12 A related issue with opioid prescription for acute pain is the risk of diversion or inappropriate use from leftover pills . Approximately 40-50 percent of those who abuse opioids initially obtain the drugs 29from family members or friends with pills remaining from legitimate prescriptions.13 Many studies have found excessive levels of routine opioid prescriptions for a range of surgical procedures or emergency department visits for painful conditions.14,15 One study of 1,416 patients in a 6 -month period found that surgeons prescribed a mean of 24 pills (standardized to 5 mg oxycodone) but that patients reported using a mean of only 8.1 pills (utilization rate 34 percent ).16 The South Dakota State Medical Association's Committee on Pain Management and Prescription Drug Abuse has reviewed current literature and existing clinical guidelines in order to articulate the following recommendations for effective and responsible treatment of acute pain, including the use of opioid analgesics. Although the practices described in these guidelines are intended to apply broadly, they are not intended to establish a \"standard of care.\" All prescribers must exercise their own best medical judgment when providing treatment, taking all relevant circumstances into account, including the potential for abuse, diversion , and risk for addiction associated with opioid analgesics . Types and levels of acute pain Acute pain is typically define d as pain concordant with the degree of tissue damage and which remits with resolution of the injury. A more holistic definition is \"a complex, unpleasant experience with emotional and cognitive, as well as sensory, features that occur in response to tiss ue trauma.\"17 This definition captures the multiple levels of effects that pain can have, as well as the fact that cognitive and emotional factors can influence how pain is perceived. The subjective experience of pain (as opposed to the purely physical phenomenon of nociceptive nerve activation) varies widely in degree (from mild to severe) and quality ( dull, sharp, stinging, burning, throbbing, etc.) and is significantly modulated by such factors as: Type of injury or surgical procedure Cultural or ethic factors History of drug or alcohol use History of anxiety or depression Anatomic location Injuries or procedures involving bones and joints tend to be more painful than those involving soft tissues .16 For example, in one study of 5 ,703 ambulatory surgical patients, those having microdiscectomy were most likely to have s evere pain, followed by laparoscopi c cholecystectomy, shoulder surgery, elbo w or hand surgery, ankle procedures, hernia repair, and knee surgery .18 Variations in pa in levels for different procedures can also be seen in data about the amount of opioids needed to 30control pain. In one study, in which opioid doses were standardized to units of 5 mg pills of oxycodone, 5 pills were adequate for patients having partial ma stectomy, 10 pills for partial mastectomy with lymph node biopsy, and 15 pills for laparoscopic cholecystectomy and inguinal hernia repair.19 (Significantly, in this study, many patients used no opioids, ranging from 22 percent after hernia repair to 82 percent after partial mastectomy.) Another study found that in the 3 days post -surgery, patients having wrist or hand surgery used about 7 pills, those having forearm or elbows procedures used an average of 11 pills, and those havin g upper arm or shoulder procedures used an average of 22 pills (all pills standardized to oxycodone or hydrocodone 5 mg or codeine 30 mg) .16 Table 1 . Common types of acute pain20 Type Source or Examples Acute illness Appendicitis, renal colic, myocardial infarction Perioperative Head and neck surgery Chest and chest wall surgery Abdominal surgery Orthopedic and vascular surgery (back, extremities) Major trauma Motor vehicle accident Minor trauma Sprain, laceration Burns Fire, chemical exposure Procedural Bone marrow biopsy, endoscopy, catheter placement, circumcision, chest tube placement, immunization, suturing Obstetrical Childbirth by vaginal delivery or Cesarean section Assessing pain The etiology of acute pain, as opposed to chronic pain, is typically straightforward since it is usually associated with some kind of obvious injury, disease process, surgery, or procedure. Nonetheless, it can be helpful to systematically evaluate the pai n using pain scales (numerical or visual -analog) to increase the precision of a patient's self -report and provide a baseline against which to evaluate analgesia and/or healing over time. Consider the following steps in assessing acute pain:21 Ask the patient to describe the pain using 5 characteristics: a.What makes the pain more or less intense? b.What does the pain feel like ? (i.e., dull, throbbing, sharp, pins -and-needles) 31c.Does the pain spread anywhere? d.How severe is the pain? e.Is the pain constant or does it come and go? The answers to these questions can help determine if the pain is nociceptive (i.e., the result of injury to bones and muscles) or neuropathic (i.e., the result of injury to peripheral or central nerves). Making this determination is important because neuropathic pain is not particularly responsive to non- steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs ( NSAID s) Other medications such as antidepressants or anticonvulsants may be mor e appropriate first -line agents for neuropathic pain . As will be detailed later in these guidelines, opioid analgesics should not typically be considered as first -line agents for acute pain, nonetheless, just when assessing patients in chronic pain, it is important to evaluate a patient in acute pain for risk of opioid dependence or abuse. Such assessment is not completely objective, and opinions differ about which patients should be more rigorously assessed. Some favor a \"universal precautions\" approach, in which all pain patients are considered to have some degree of vulnerability to abuse and addiction and, hence, all patients are given the same screenings and diagnostic procedures.22 Some patient characteristics, however, do appear to be predictive of a potential for drug abuse, misuse, or other aberrant behaviors, particularly a person al or family history of alcohol or drug abuse.23 Some studies also show that younger age and the presence of psych iatric conditions are associated with aberrant drug -related behaviors.23 Relatively brief, validated tools can help formalize assess ment of a patient's risk of having a substance misuse problem (Table 2 ) and these should be considered for routine clinical use.23 For more information on risk reduction strategies, a free online CME is available at www.opioidprescribing.com. The 4Ps of Screening Parents - Did any of your parents have a problem with alcohol or drug use? Partner - Does your partner have a problem with alcohol or drug use? Past - In the past, have you had difficulties in your life because of alcohol or other drugs, including prescription medications? Present - In the past month, have you drunk any alcohol or used other drugs - illicit or otherwise? 32Table 2. Tools for Patient Risk A ssessment Tool Who Administers?

This can help identify patients at higher risk for opiate overdose or opiate use disorder, and help determine which patients may benefit from gr eat caution and increased monitoring or interventions when risk factors are present. Research indicates that most fatal overdoses could be identified retrospectively on the basis of two pieces of information - multiple prescribers and high total daily opi ate dosage - both of which are available to prescribers through the PDMP AWARxE . PDMP AWARxE offers point -of-care access to pharmacy dispensing records of controlled substances from prescribers. From these, clinicians can quickly assess patterns of presc ription drug use that can be helpful in confirming or refuting suspicions of aberrant behaviors. Information from PDMP AWARxE may also reveal that a patient is being prescribed medications whose combinations are contraindicated. By reviewing the PDMP each prescriber can identify other prescribers involved in the care of their patient. Pharmacies and practitioners that dispense any Schedule II, III, or IV controlled substances in South Dakota, or to an address in South Dakota, must report such dispensing to PDMP AWARxE . 33Strategies for acute pain control Ladder of pain The World Health Organization advocates a 3 -step \"Pain relief ladder\" model in which non - pharmacologic or non -opioid approaches are preferred as first -line pain treatment, followed by low-dose or low -potency opioids with or without adjunctive pharmacological or non -pharmacological therapies, and, for moderate to severe pain, higher doses and/or more potent opioids with or without adjunctive treatment.24 Variations on this model include a \"fast -track\" approach that skips directly to step 3 for controlling intense acute pain, incorporation of \"movement\" on the ladder both up (when, for example, a disease process worsens) as well as down ( in response to he aling or remission of symptoms), and adding a 4th step that includes invasive procedures such as nerve blocks, neurolysis, epidurals, and spinal stimulators .25 Figure 1. 4 -Step Adaptation of WHO analgesic ladder Clinicians should bear in mind that the goal of pain treatment is not necessarily zero pain, but a level of pain that is tolerable and that allows the patient maximum physical and emotional functioning with the lowest risk of side effects, progression to c hronic pain, or misuse or abuse. This requires an adroit balancing of many factors (both patient -related and drug -related). One way to operationalize this paradigm is with multimodal analgesia, in which several therapeutic approaches , each acting at diffe rent 34sites of the pain pathway, are used, which can reduce dependence on a single medication and may reduce or eliminate the need for opioids.26 Using both pharmacological and non -pharmacological interventions, and, if warranted, opioid and non -opioid medications can reduce overall opioid use as well as opioid - related adverse effects. This approach involves the use of more than one method or modality of controlling pain (e.g., drugs from two or more classes, or drug plus non -drug treatment) to obtain additive beneficial effects, reduce side effects, or both. These modalities may operate through different mechanisms or at different sites (i.e., peripheral versus central actions).26 One example of multimodal analgesia is the use of various combinations of opioids and local anesthetics to manage postoperative pain. Table 3 summarizes some specific examples of multimodal therapy ; Appendix 1 provides a workflow guidline. Some b enefits of multimodal analgesia include earlier ambulation, oral intake, and hospital discharge for postoperative patients as well as higher levels of participation in activities necessary for recovery (e.g., physical therapy).26 Some pain experts advocate revision of traditional postoperative care programs to include accelerated multimodal postoperative recovery programs. Table 3 . Examples of multimodal therapy Combination of Agents Systemic NSAID plus systemic opioid Systemic NSAID plus epidural opioid and local anesthetic Systemic NSAID plus local infiltration of anesthetic plus systemic opioid Regional block plus systemic NSAID opioid and local anesthetic Ketamine plus opioid Non-pharmacologic al treatment s for acute pain When possible, non -pharmacologic methods should be used, alone or combin ed with a nalgesics, to manage acute pain. The degree to which this can be done depends on the severity of pain , availability, and patient preference, but many non -pharmacological approaches can be very effective and their use avoids the potential side effects and risks associated with pharmacological interventions. Non-pharmacologic methods for managing early -phase acute pain :20 Application of cold (standard protocols are icing for 20 minu tes every two hours or every 10 minutes, alternating with 10 minutes of rest) Compression 35Elevation Immobilization (although recovery from some injuries, such as ankle sprains, may be faster with graduated exercises rather than rest alone)27 Non-pharmacologic methods for late -phase acute pain and/or pain prophylaxis Physical therapy Yoga Hypnosis /guided imagery Massage Physical methods of acute pain management can be helpful in all phases of care, including immediately after tissue trauma (e.g., rest, application of cold, compression, elevation) and late during the healing period (e.g., exercises to regain strength and r ange of motion). Mind/body or psychological therapies can encourage active patient participation in their care, address psychological or social dimensions of pain, and can support sustained improvements in pain and function with minimal risks. These therap ies are not always , or fully , covered by insurance, and access and cost can be barriers , but for many patients, non-pharmacologic management can be used even with limited access to specialty care. A randomized trial comparing patients assigned to low -cost group aerobics vs. more expensive individual physiotherapy and muscle reconditioning sessions found similar reductions in low back pain intensity, frequency , or disability.28 Low-cost options to increase physical activity include brisk walking in public spaces or use of public recreation facilities for group exercise. Cognitive beh avioral therapy ( CBT ) can help address psychosocial contributors to pain and has been shown to improve function.29 Primary care clinicians can integrate elements of CBT into their practice by simply encouraging patients to take an active role in the ir care plan, by supporting patients in engaging in beneficial activities such as exercise, or by providing education in relaxation techniques and coping strategies. There may be free or low -cost patient support, self -help, and educational community - based programs in more populated areas of South Dakota that can provide stress reduction and other mental health benefits. Patients with more entrenched anxiety or fear related to pa in, or other significant psychological distress, can be referred for formal therapy w ith a mental health specialist. Multimodal therapies should be considered for patients not responding to single -modality therapy, and combinations should be tailored depen ding on patient needs, cost, and convenience. Additional details on some common non -pharmacological treatments shown to be effective in managing acute pain follow. 36Physical therapy Physical therapy may be useful for a range of musculoskeletal issues and c an be helpful in recovering from acute pain -producing traumas initially treated with other methods. A 2018 study reported that patients with low back pain who first consulted a physical therapist were less likely to receive an opioid prescription compared to those who first saw their primary care provider .30 Physical therapists typically create individualized exercise, stretches, and body alignment adjustments to help relax tight muscles, decrease back and joint pain, and improve range of m otion. Professional guidelines have strongly recommended aerobic, aquatic, and/or resistance exercises for patients with osteoarthritis of the knee or hip31 and maintenance of activity for patients with low back pain.32 Yoga Yoga involves poses with a range of extensions and challenge, which can be tailored to an individual's level of flexibility, strength, and condition ing. Moderate evidence suggests that y oga can reduce late -stage acute pain, as well as chronic pain conditions, particularly back pain. For example, a 2017 trial randomized 131 patients (mean age 75) with lower extremity osteoarthritis to twice -weekly sessions of chair yoga vs. a health education program.33 At 3-month follow -up, participants in the yoga group showed greater reductions in pain interferences (P=0.01) compared to contr ol.30 During the intervention, patients in the yoga group had reduced pain and improved gait speed compared to the control group. In addition to reducing pain, the people in the yoga group were more likely to have stopped taking pain relievers at one-year follow -up. Massage Massage therapy may help relieve muscular pain (acute or chronic) as well as reduce stress and anxiety. Some massage therapists specialize in working with people recovering from injuries or surgeries, or they may have focused training for treating particular conditions such as back or neck pain. A review of seven randomized trials with 352 participants suggests that massage as a st and-alone treatment may be better than no treatment for reducing pain.34 The trials were di verse with respect to outcomes, massage techniques, and patient populations. Clinical effect sizes for pain were moderate with about a 20 -point reduction in pain scores from a baseline of 50 -60 points. The functional benefits were less clear; some trials s howed no benefit while others showed improvement in the 50 -foot walk test. A 201 1 study randomized 401 adults with back pain to two types of weekly massage (structural and relaxation) for 10 weeks vs. a usual care group. At the end of the study 36 percent of the adults having structural massage and 40 percent of the adults having relaxation massage reported that their pain was \"much better\" or \"gone\" vs. 4 percent of the control group.35 37Hypnosis Clinical hypnosis is a procedure in which a trained clinician or therapist gives a patient a series of verbal instructions with the goal of helping the patient enter a state of deep relaxation. In this relaxed state, the patient is aware of everything that is going on, but at the same time, becomes increasingly absorbed in using his or her imagination as directed by the therapist. Therapists often teach their patients self-hypnosis me thods that they can employ on their own to reinforce and continue the process at home. Evidence -based research on the use of hypnosis to relieve pain is limited, but a large, well - designed study , however a 2000 trial evaluated the effectiveness of hypnosis \u2014termed \"nonpharmacologic analgesia\" \u2014in easing pain and anxiety in people who were having minimally invasive surgical therapies such as angiograms, angioplasty, simple kidney procedures, or liver biopsies, during which they remain ed conscious.36 Patients participated in a self -hypnosis relaxation session that involved deep -breathing and concentration techniques. The researchers found that these patients required less than half the amount of analgesic drugs compared to those receiving standard treatments. Procedures also took less time for the hypnosis group, and participants had lower levels of anxiety and pain at both one hour and fou r hours into the procedure. Pharmacologic al management of acute pain Most acute pain is nociceptive and responds to non -opioids and opioids. However, some adjuvant analgesics (e.g., local anesthetics) also are used to manage acute pain and medications for neuropathic pain are also important agents in the analgesic armamentarium . In general, mild -to-moderate acute pain responds well to oral non -opioids (e.g., acetaminophen, NSAIDs, and topical agents ). Moderate to severe acute pain is m ore likely to require opioids , although, as mentioned earlier, lower doses and short durations may be appropriate. NSAIDs and acetaminophen NSAIDs, which include aspirin and other salicylic acid derivatives, and acetaminophen are used in the management of both acute and chronic pain such as that arising from injury, arthritis, dental procedures, swelling, or surgical procedures. Although they are weaker analgesics than opioids , acetaminophen and NSAIDs do not produce tolerance, physical dependence, or addi ction and they do not induce respiratory depression or constipation . Acetaminophen and NSAIDs are often added to an opioid regimen for their opioid -sparing effect. Since non -opioids relieve pain via different mechanisms than opioids , combination therapy can provide improved relief with fewer side effects. 38These agents are not without risk, however. Potential a dverse effects of NSAIDs include gastrointestinal problems (e.g., stomach upset, ulcers, perforation, bleeding, liver dysfunc tion), bleeding (i.e., antiplatelet effects), kidney dysfunction, hypersensitivity reactions and cardiovascular concerns, particularly in the elderly.37 The threshold dose for acetaminophen liver toxicity has not been established; however, the SDSMA recommends that the total adult daily dose should not exceed 3,000 mg in patients without liver disease (although the ce iling may be lower for older adults).38 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) currently sets a maximum limit of 325 mg of acetaminophen in prescription combination products (e.g., hydrocodone and acetaminophen) in an attempt to l imit liver damage and other potential ill effects of these products.32 Topical agents Topical capsaicin and salicylates can both be effective for short term pain relief and generally have fewer side effects than oral analgesics, but their long -term effic acy is not well studied.39,40 Topical NSAIDs and lidocaine have been reported to b e effective for short -term relief of superficial pain with minimal side effects, although both are more expensive than topical capsaicin and salicylates. None of the topical agents are useful for non -superficial pain. Anticonvulsants Antiepileptic drugs ( AEDs) are increasingly used for treating neuropathic pain because they can reduce membrane excitability and suppress abnormal discharges in pathologically altered neurons.41 The exact mechanism of action for their analgesic effects, however, is unclear. It does not appear to be specifically related to their antiepileptic activit y. Other drugs that suppress seizures (e.g., barbiturates) do not relieve pain, and some AEDs with effective antiepileptic activity do not necessarily have good analgesic activity.42 Few trials have evaluated AEDs in acute pain conditions, so the evidence base is weak .43 A 2017 trial, for exa mple, randomized 209 patients with acute or chronic sciatica to pregabalin 150 mg/day vs. placebo and found no significant differences in leg pain or functional outcomes.44 Ketamine Ketamine has been used as a general anesthetic since the 1960s, but its use in subanesthetic concentrations for analgesia has grown rapidly in recent years , due, in part, to efforts to reduce the risks of chronic opioid use .45 Ketamine has been successfully used to treat such acute pain conditions as sickle cell crises, renal colic, and trauma.45 39Opioids for acute pain in opioid -na\u00efve patients If an opioid is deemed necessary to treat acute pain , oxycodone, hydrocodone, or tramadol in short -acting formulations are commonly used. Guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and other organizations strongly recommend that only short -acting opioids be prescribed for acute pain because they reach peak effect more quickly than extended -release formulations and the risk of unintentional overdose is reduced.46 (One study looking at the prescription of opioids in about 840,000 opioid -na\u00efve patients over 10 years found that unintentional overdose was 5 times more likely in patients prescribed extended - release opioids compared to immediate -release opioids.47) Research shows general equivalency of efficacy and tolerability between different opioids. Hydrocodone 5 mg, oxycodone 5 mg, and tramadol 50 mg alone or in combination with acetaminophen or ibuprofen have similar analgesic power to treat acute pain.48-50 Oxycodone and hydromorphone are available as pure drug s, whereas hydrocodone (in the United States) is only available co - formulated with acetaminophen or ibuprofen, therefore oxycodone or hydromorphone might be preferred if a patient is already taking acetaminophen or NSAIDs, or if those drugs are prescribed simultaneously with the opioid as part of multi -modal therapy. Dose and d uration o f opioid therapy Only enough opioids should be prescribed to a ddress the expected duration and severity of pain from an injury or procedure (or to cover pain relief until a follow -up appointment) . Several guidelines about opioid prescribing for acute pai n from emergency departments51,52 and other settings3,53 have recommended prescribing 3 days of opioids in most cases, whereas others have recommended 7 days,54 or 14 days.55 CDC guidelines suggest that f or most painful conditions (barring major surgery or trauma) a 3 -day supply should be enough, although many factors must be taken into account (for example, some patients in South Dakota might live so far away from a health care facility or pharmacy that somewhat larger supplies might be justified).46 Clinician discretion in choosing an opioid and deciding how much to prescribe is always necessary because so many factors inf luence how a patient will respond to both pain and an analgesic. These factors include: Legal limits on opioid prescribing A number of states have passed laws in recent years regulating the prescription of opioids for acute pain, with allowed durations of prescriptions for opioid - na\u00efve patien ts ranging from 5 -10 days.1 To date, South Dakota does not have similar regulations, although the South Dakota De partment of Health has appointed a Prescription Opioid Abuse Advisory Committee (to which SDSMA has a representative) to review opioid use in the state and develop strategies for preventing opioid misuse and abuse.2 40Age Hepatic or renal impairment Genetic polymorphisms Comorbid conditions History of substance abuse Potential drug -drug interaction Co-administration with other central nervous system depressants Opioid -induced hyperalgesia Basic science and clinical data suggest that patients receiving opioids can actually become more sensitive to painful stimuli.56 This opioid -induced hyperalgesia is probably due to up regulation of pro - nociceptive pathways in the peripheral and central nervous systems.57 Although hyperalgesia has traditionally been associated with chronic pain, it can also occur after intraoperative or postoperative administration of high -dose opioid s as well as in low -dose or maintenance -dose regimens.58 Opioid - induced hyperalgesia is different pharmacologi cally from the phenomenon of opioid tolerance, although both can lead to an increased need for opioids and disentangling the two, clinically, can be difficult. Calculating morphine equivalents Calculating a patient's total daily dose of opioids is import ant to appropriately and effectively prescribe, manage, and taper opioid medications use for both acute and chronic pain . This can be done with printed or online equianalgesic charts, which provide conversion factors and dose equivalents of all available o pioid medications relative to a standard dose of morphine. Care must be taken in using such charts because dose is not the only relevant variable. Clinicians must also consider the route of administration, cross tolerance, half -life, and the bioavailabili ty of a drug. In addition, the patient's existing level of opioid toleran ce must be taken into account. Printed equianalgesic charts are common, and online calculators are also freely available (a common one can be accessed at clincalc.com/Opioids). The C DC provides a helpful guide to opioid conversions available at: www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/pdf/calculating_total_daily_dose -a.pdf Pain medicine specialists Integrated pain management requires coordination of medical, psychological, and social aspects of hea lth care and includes primary care, mental health care, and specialist services when needed Consultation with an addiction medicine specialist or psychiatrist may be necessary if an episode of acute 41pain involves many complicating variables (such as multiple comorbidities) or if opioids are needed but the patient is already using an opioid for chronic pain and/or opioid maintenance therapy. Patient education Before prescribin g an opioid for acute pain, providers should discuss the known risks and benefits of such therapy. Providers should talk openly and honestly to patients in order to arrive at informed decisions about opioid therapy. Here are some suggestions : Be explicit and realistic about expected benefits , including the fact that complete pain relief is unlikely and not necessarily desired Emphasize improvement in function as a primary goal and that function can improve even when some pain in present Advise patients abo ut potential serious adverse effects including respiratory depression , constipation, and development of an opioid use disorder Review common effects such as dry mouth, nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, confusion, tolerance, physical dependence, and withdrawal symptoms when stopping opioids Discuss effects that opioids might have on one's ability to operate a vehicle, particularly when opioid s are initiated, when dosages are increased, or when other central nervous system depressants, such as benzodiazepines or alcohol are used concurrently Review increased risks for respiratory depression when opioids are taken with benzodiazepines, other sed atives, alcohol, illicit drugs such as heroin, or other opioids Discuss risks to household members and other individuals if opioids are intentionally or unintentionally shared with others from whom they are not prescribed. Consider whether cognitive limitations might interfere with management of opioid therapy, and if so, determine whether a caregiver can responsibly co -manage the therapy In addition, whenever an opioid is prescribed, the patient should be educated about th e safe storage and disposal of opioid medications. This can be done by a non -physician/provider , if desired, and the key points can be included in patient -provider agreements or treatment plans. Safe use means following clinician instructions about dosing, avoiding potentially dangerous drug interactions, and assuring full understanding of how the medication should be consumed or applied. Remind patients that pain medications are sought after by many people, and, thus it is best if opioids are stored in a locked cabinet or other secure storage unit. If a locked unit is not available, patients should, at least, not keep opioids in a place that is obvious to, or easily accessed by others, since theft by 42friends, relatives, and guests is a known route by whic h opioids become diverted.59 Storage areas should be cool, dry, and out of direct sunlight. Proper disposal methods should be explained : Follow any specific disposal instructions on the prescription drug labeling or patient information that accompanies the medication Do not flush medicines down the sink or toilet unless this information specifically instructs to do so Return medications to a pharmacy, health center, or other organization with a take -back program Mix the medication with an undesirable substance (e.g., coffee groun ds or kitty litter) and put it in the trash Specific acute pain populations Management of acute perioperative pain A full discussion of ways to manage perioperative pain is beyond the scope of this document because it can involve a diverse array of pharm acological and invasive measures administered by hospital -based anest hesiologists or pain specialists in order to relieve suffering, achieve early mobilization post -surgery, and reduce hospital stay. It is worth noting, however, that a multimodal approach to acute pain management is the primary model for dealing with perioperative pain as it is, more generally, for the treatment of acute pain in primary care settings. Also, just as competent and responsi ble treatment of acute pain in primary care can help prevent the development of chronic pain and attendant morbidities, research has shown an array of a dverse outcomes associated with the under -treatment of perioperative pain , including thromboembolic and pulmonary complications, additional time spent in an intensive care unit or hospital, hospital readmission for further pain management, needless suffering, impairment of health -related quality of life, and development of chronic pain.60 In addition, the issue of opioid analgesic over prescription is as important an issue in the perioperative arena as it is anywhere in medicine. A 2018 cohort study of 2,392 adults having a range of surgeries found that, overall, a median of 30 pills of hydrocodone/acetaminophen (5/325 mg) were prescribed for postsurgical pain, but patients only use d a median of 9 pills.61 The study also found that the stronges t association with higher use of opioids was not level of pain, but the quantity of opioids prescribed: 0.53 more pills used (95 percent CI 0.4 -0.65 p < 0.001) for every additional pill prescribed.62 43Table 4 summarizes a set of 2019 recommendations from the Michigan Opioid Prescribing Engagement Network.

Management of acute pain in patients already using opioids or on Medication -Assisted Treatment When caring for patients who are physically dependent on opioids \u2014whether because of ongoing chronic pain or opioids used as part of treating opioid use disorder (OUD) \u2014clinicians must know the type and quantity of opioid the patient is currently using so that an equivalent (equianalgesic) dose can be administered by an appropriate route to cover their baseline opioid requirement as well as the additional medication required for the acute pain. Some clinicians mistakenly believe that the opioid agonist therapy (methadone ) or partial agonist therapy (buprenorphine) used for medication -assisted therapy (MAT) provides enough analgesia to \"cover\" acute pain.64 In fact, the doses of methadone and buprenorphine typically used in MAT do not provide sustained analgesic effects and are insufficient to treat acute pain.62 Patients on opioid agonist therapy also develop cross -tolerance, which means they require higher a nd more frequent doses of short - or long -acting opioids to provide analgesia for episodes of acute pain. Because buprenorphine binds to mu-receptors with much higher affinity than other opioid agonists, pain management in patients using buprenorphine can be complicated. Several types of regimens using both buprenorphi ne and other opioids for acute pain have been described in the literature with choices of regimen guided by the specifics of a patient's existing regimen, presence of comorbid conditions, setting, and degree of acute pain.64 Patients S erved by Multiple Providers Ideally, patients in pain, whether acute or chronic, would receive prescriptions for analgesic prescriptions or other pain treatments from a single provider. In the real world, this is often neither possible nor feasible. Unfortunately, the risks of overdose and overdose -related death rise steeply as the number of prescribers increases . For exampl e, the risk of overdose (from prescribed opioids or sedatives) is 3.5 times higher for patient with 4 -5 prescribers compared to patients seeing a single prescriber.65 Increasing numbers of prescribers is a potential indicator of opioid misuse or abuse, but it can also be related to non -problematic causes such as high use of emergency room services, suboptimal medical care, \"nomadic \" or \"migrant\" populations, or of populations in which providers rotate through clinics on a short -term, regular basis (as can be the case in areas serviced by the Indian Health Service). It is not always easy to determine whether a patient with multiple providers is o btaining overlapping prescriptions in an attempt to obtain more medication than a single provider would give. But the existence of multiple 45providers should be a \"red flag\" warranting investigation, starting with conversations with the patient, but always including use of a PDMP. Emergency department considerations Although emergency departments prescribe only a fraction of opioid analgesics prescribed nationwide , ED prescriptions for opioid s are reported to account for about 45 percent of the opioids diverted for non -medical use.52 Guidelines from the American Academy of Emergency Medicine and other groups have attempted to reduce the variability in pain management and prescribing practices that has been evident in past de cades. These guidelines mirror recommendations by the CDC and other organizations , with the following key provisions:52 Give short -acting opioids as second -line treatment to other analgesics unless there is clear indication for opioid (e.g., acute abdominal pain or long bone fracture) Start with lowest effective dose Prescribe no more than a 3-day course of opioid for most acute pain conditions Address exacerbations of chronic pain with non -opioid analgesics, non-pharmacological therapies, or referral to pain specialists for follow -up Assess for opioid misuse or addiction using validated screening tools Access PDMPs when available Avoid long -acting or extended -release opioids Refrain from refilling chronic opi oid prescriptions \u2014refer to treating clinician who provided original prescription Refrain from replacing lost, stolen, or destroyed opioid prescriptions Understand that the federal Emergency Medical Treat ment and Labor Act ( EMTALA ) does not state that severe pain is an emergency medical condition , and that EMTALA allows emergency medical provider s to withhold opioid treatment if in their professional judgment such withholding is clinically justified Older adults Older patients are at increased risk of acute pain related to trauma, surgery or procedures, or degenerative conditions such as osteoarthritis . The elderly undergo surgery four times more often than other age groups, and are therefore more likely to suffer from associated pain.66 In those 65 years and older, acute pain leads to about 4 million U.S. emergency department visits each year.67 Assessing and treating pain in older patients can be complicated by issues such as age -related physiologic changes, physical accessibility to treatment, cognitive impairment, coexisting illnesses, and 46polypharmacy. Elderly patients may under - or over -report their experience of pain due to functional impairment or psychological distress. Doses of NSAIDs often need to be reduced to avoid hepatic or kidney damage, and opioids may induce unacceptable risks related to falls, constipation, or respiratory depression. Clinical decision -making must take into account all of these considerations, e ach of which can increase the risk for adverse outcomes. Pregnancy In general, and w henever possible, opioids should be avoided in pregnancy due to associations between opioid use and adverse fetal outcomes such as stillbirth, poor fetal growth, pre-term delivery, and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome.46 If a opioid is indicated however, don't hesitate to prescribe based on conce rn for neonatal abstinence syndrome alone (NAS) . Before prescribing opioids in pregnancy: Ensure opioids are indicated Maximize non -opioid therapy, including exercise, physical therapy, behavioral approaches, and non -opioid medications Discuss the risks and benefits of opioids, including the risk of physiologic dependence and the risk of NAS Take a thorough history of substance use and review the PDMP AWARxE. For reproductive age women who are not pregnant, discuss family planning and effects on pre gnancy. 47Conclusions Although the focus of much public and professional attention in the past decade has been on the problems related to opioid analgesic prescribing for chronic pain, as this report had demonstrated, the treatment and management of acute pain is an equally important topic because many of the same dynamics (e.g., prescribing opioids when non -opioids may be just as effective, or prescribing higher doses/durations than needed) are at work with acute pain as with chronic pain. Properly and r esponsibly managing acute pain is desirable not only because it relieves patient suffering, but because it reduces the chances that acute pain will morph into chronic pain, and it can help stem the tide of opioid diversion, misuse, and abuse. Opioids can, of course, play an invaluable role in the pain management armamentarium, but they carry important risks, as well, and thus should be general ly viewed as second -line agents or as part of a multi -modal approach. The risks of opioids, even when used for ac ute pain and for relatively short durations, are amplified among older adults , patients with impaired renal or hepatic function , those with COPD, cardiopulmonary disorders, sleep apnea, or mental illness , and in anyone likely to combine opiates with other respiratory depressants such as alcohol or benzodiazepines. These guidelines present evidence -based recommendations for treating acute pain with a range of pharmacological and non -pharmacological strategies to be administered usually in a step -like fashion , with opioids only used when necessary and then at the lowest dose and shortest duration deemed clinically beneficial. As with treating chronic pain, the appropriate deployment of opioids for chronic pain can be challenging, but it is not inherently diffe rent from using any other treatment option with significant risks of harm. With proper pain assessment , primary reliance on non -pharmacologic and non -opioid analgesics, and a view that includes critical emotional, psychological, and social dimensions of pain, clinicians can both relieve immediate suffering and maximize their patients' long -term health. 48Appendix 1. Acute Pain Workflow Guideline Patient presents with acute pain or anticipated postoperative pain Brief Pain Assessment: In the emergency setting use opioids judiciously to alleviate pain when it overwhelms the patient's ability to contribute to the assessment. Comprehensive Pain Assessment: Inclusive of the following: Etiology and nature of the pain Appropriate diagnostics Medication history, including past and current opioid use Check PDMP (Prescription Drug Monitoring Program) Acute Exacerbation of Chronic Pain Treatment Options: Avoid prescribing increased dosage or additional opioids because of potential risks and adverse effect. Check prescriptio n monitoring program (PDMP) f or history of opioid prescriptions. Consult t he patient's pain care agreement prior to prescribing any medications. Consider collaborating with the clinician managing the patient's chronic pain care plan, an interdisciplinary team o r available r esources to provide appropriate chronic pain management. Assess the patient's mental health status and social situati on to determine if additional resources, e .g. social services, behavioral health, pain management or addiction medici ne consult may be appropriate.Non -traumatic tooth pain Other Acute Pain Symptom Management could include: Long -acting local anesthetic. NSAID a nd/or acetaminophen. Topical anesthetic rinse for stomatitis or mouth ulcers. Antibiotics with presence of swelling or exudates in cheek or jaw. Chlorhexidine mout h wash for localized gum inflammation/infection. Stress need for dental follow up and avoid prescribing opioids without examination and diagnosis of the underlying reason for tooth pain, including appropriate tests and X-r ays.See Page 2 Symptom Management could include: 49Acute Pain Workflow Guideline Other Acute Pain Severe Pain that may require opioid: (i.e. fracture, post operative pain, severe injury) Common pain conditions that are almost never indicated for opioids (non- inclusive): Fibromyalgia Headache Self-limited illness, i.e., sore throat Uncomplicated back and neck pain Uncomplicated musculoskeletal pain Treat with other analgesics or NSAIDs, physical, psychological , interventional, or other appropriate non-opioid therapies. Reassure and provide patient education, include expectedduration of pain episode and warning signs that would require immediate medical attention. Arrange appropriate follow -up.Appropriate therapy and/or referral: Does potential benefit of opioids outweigh potential risk? NO YES Prescription of Opioids: Assess for risk: Personal or Family History ofSubstance abuse? Personal History of misuse ofprescription controlled substance? Concurrent sedative, alcohol, muscle relaxant use? Respiratory insufficiency or sl eep apnea? Identify risk factor s such as age, delirium, dementia, and f all risk. Check PDMPDetermine if prescribing opioid Is appropriate. High Risk Patients: Avoid prescribing opioid and use alternative if at all possible and refer to PCP or to pain specialist or provider experienced in case of opioi d at risk patients. If must prescribe such as in severe injury. Use lowest dose for shortest period of time. Educate and document risks w ith patient Monitor closely. Consider naloxone prescription Particularl y for total daily dosage > 50 mg Morphi ne Equi valents (MME).Educate patient on opioi d risks/benefits to make informed decision and review side effects. If opioids are deemed necessary, prescribe only an amount to cover the expected pain or reali stic durati on of time to a follow-up appointment. (Tramadol is an atypical opioi d and should be managed appropriately). Never prescribe long-acting/extended- release for acute pain. Caut ion using opioids in the elderly. Review safe d riving, work, storage, and disposal . Follow-up with patient withi n 3-5 days. Maximize appropriate non-op ioid therapies.Is the answer yes to any of the above? NO YES 50Acute Pain Workflow Guideline Clinical Pearls 1. Over 5 million Americans report that they currently (within 30 days) abuse prescription opioids and 10.3 million have abused them at some point in their lifetime. It has been noted that although most of these pills originated from a licensed prescriber, only 20% of users were the l egitimate recipient of the initial prescription, with 71% of users having received the drug through methods of diversion. In addition, it is reported that 55% of these peopl e received pills for free from a family member or friends who had excess pills.2,3,4 2. In one study of 642 general surgery patients i t was found that opioid pills are greatly over-p rescribed for the treatment of acute postoperative pain in general surgery patients: over 70% of the prescribed pills were never taken. In this study, depending on the procedure, 22 -82% of patients never took any opioid following surgery.1 References 1. Ann Surg 2016 Sep 14.

Therapeutic Class Overview Tetracyclines INTRODUCTION The tetracycline class of antibiotics, discovered in the 1940s, has been widely used for its broad- spectrum bacteriostatic activity (Nelson and Levy 2011). The tetracyclines are useful in treating aerobic gram -positive, gram -negative er, these drugs have little activity against fungi and viruses (May 2019). The tetracyclines have a number of indications, some of which include acne, rosacea, sexually -transmitted diseases, acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections ( ABSSSIs), urinary tract infections, respiratory tract infections, and v arious other infections (see Table 2 for the labelled indications for the individual agent s) (May 2019) . The antimicrobial ac tivity is generally similar between the tetracyclines, although some differences in the relativ e degr ee of activity against certain pathogens do exist among the various agents (May 2019). T etracyclines function by binding reversibly to the 30S ribosomal subunit at a position that blocks the binding of t he am inoacyl -tRNA to t he acceptor site on the mRNA -ribosome complex. Protein synthesis is ultimately inhibited, leading t o a bac teriostatic effect (May 2019). With regard to resistance, once resistance develops to one of the drugs in this class, it is typically conferred to all tetracyclines. However, there are differences in resistance among species of bacteria (May 2019). Doxycycline and minocycline are the most frequently prescribed drugs in this class ( May 2019). Newer oral tetracyclines approved in 2018 by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) include Nuzyra (omadacycline) and Seysara (sarecycline). Omadacycline was approved for bacterial pneumonia (CABP) and ABS SSIs (including cellulitis, wound infection, and major cutaneous abscess ); while sarecycline was approved for t he t reatment of inflammatory lesions of non- nodular moderate to severe acne vulgaris in patients 9 years of age (Drugs@FDA 2019, FDA multi -discipline review [Nuzyra] 2018). Community -acquired pneumonia (CAP) is an acute infection of the pulmonary parenchyma in a patient who has acquired the infection in the community. CAP is a common and potentially serious illness, and is associated wit h c onsiderable morbidity and mortality, particularly in older adults and those with major comorbidities ( File 2018). Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most commonly identified bacterial cause of CA BP worldwide. Other comm on pat hogens identified and anaerobes (in the setting of aspiration). Viruses are also common causes of CAP ( FDA multi-discipline review [Nuzyra] 2018, Marrie and Fil e 2018 ). Systemic antibiotics are recommended in the management of moderate and severe acne and forms of inflammatory acne that are resistant to topical treatments ( Zaenglein et al 2016). The tetracycline class of antibiotics should be considered first -line therapy in moderate to severe acne, except when contraindicated ( Zaenglein et al 2016) .

CLINICAL EFFICACY SUMMARY There are numerous clinical trials that have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of the tetracyclines for their respect ive FDA-approved indications , with no significant differences observed among the agents in this class. The focus of this section, however, will be the clinical trials for omadacycline and sarecycline (Fleischer et al 2006, Garner et al 2003, Hubbell et al 1982, Lauharanta et al 1993, Lister et al 1993, Parish et al 2005, Rosentock et al 1985) . For the treatment of CABP, the efficacy of omadacycline was evaluated in a p hase 3, double- blind (DB), active- control (AC), multi -center (MC), randomized controlled trial (RCT), known as the OPTIC trial. The trial included 774 patients 18 years of age with radiographically -confirmed pneumonia and a pneumonia severity index/ Patient Outcomes Research Team (PORT) Risk Class II, III, or IV (ie, low - to moderate- risk). Patients were treated for 7 to 14 days with omadacycline 100 mg intravenous ( IV) infusion every 12 hours for 2 doses on Day 1, followed by 100 mg I V infusion once daily for 3 days, with an option to switch to 300 mg orally once daily on Day 4 (n = 386) ; or m oxifloxacin 400 mg IV infusion once daily for 3 days, with an option to switch to 400 mg orally once daily on Day 4 ( n = 388). Of note, the efficacy and safety of an oral loading dose was not evaluated in CABP ( FDA multi -discipline review [Nuzyra] 2018, Stets et al 2019 ). The primary endpoint was clinical success ( early clinical response [ ECR]) at 72 to 120 hours after the first dose, defined as survival with improvement in 2 of 4 symptoms (cough, sputum production, chest pain, dyspnea) without deterioration. Clinical success was demonstrated in 81.1% of omadacycline- treated patients vs 82.7% of moxifloxacin- treated pat ients, with a treatment difference of - 1.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], - 7.1 to 3.8). For the clinical success endpoint, omadacycline met an efficacy finding of noninferiority vs moxifloxacin with the lower bound of the 2- sided 95% CI being greater than the pre- specified 10% noninferiority margin (80% power) . The secondary endpoint of clinical response at 5 to 10 days after the last study dose was defined as improvement i n s igns and symptoms of CABP with no further antibacterial therapy needed. Clinical response was demonstrated in 87.6% of omadacycline- treated patients vs 85.1% of moxifloxacin- treated pat ients, with a treatment difference of 2.5% (95% CI, - 2.4 to 7.4). For the treatment of ABSSSI, the efficacy of omadacycline was evaluated in 2 Phase 3, DB, AC, PG, MC, RCTs, know n as the OASIS -1 and OASIS -2 trials. The trials included a total of 1012 patients 18 years of age with ABSSSI and ev idence of a systemic inflammatory response. Of note, both trials excluded patients with necrotizing fasciitis or diabetic foot infections ( FDA multi -discipline review [Nuzyra] 2018, McGovern 2018, O'Riordan et al 2019). In OASIS -1, patients were treated with omadacycline 100 mg IV infusion every 12 hours for 2 doses on d ay 1, followed by 100 mg IV infusion once daily for 3 days, with an option to switch to 300 mg orally once daily on Day 4 ( n = 386) ; or linezolid 600 mg IV infusion twice daily for 3 days, with an option to switch to 600 mg orally every 12 hour s on Day 4 (n = 322). In OASIS -2, patients were treated with omadacycline 450 mg orally once daily for 2 days , f ollowed by 300 mg orally once daily (n = 368); or linezolid 600 mg orally every 12 hours (n = 367). Patients in bot h t rials were treated for 7 to 14 days. In both studies, the primary endpoint was clinical success ( ECR) at 48 to 72 hours after the first study dose, defi ned as a 20% decrease in lesion size without clinical failure. In OASIS -1, clinical success was demonstrated in 84.8% of omadacycline- treated patients vs 85.5% of linezolid- treated patients, with a treatment difference of - 0.7% (95% CI, - 6.3 to 4.9); in OASIS -2, clinical success was demonstrated in 87.3% of omadacycline- treated patients vs 82.2% of linezolid- treated patients, with a treatment difference of 5.1% (95% CI, - 0.2 to 10.5). In both trials, omadacycline met an efficacy finding of noninferiority for clinical success vs linezolid with the lower bound of the 2- sided 95% CI being greater than the pre- specified 10% noninferiority margin (90% power) . The secondary endpoint of clinical response at 7 to 14 days after the last dose was defined as survival with resoluti on or improvement in signs or symptoms of infection without receiving alternative antibacterial therapy and/or unpl anned m ajor surgical intervention, and sufficient resolution of infect ion. In OASIS -1, clinical response was demonstrated in 86.1% of the omadacycline- treated patients vs 83.6% of linezolid -treated patients, with a treatment difference of 2.5% (95% CI, - 3.2 to 8.2); in OASIS -2, clinical respons e w as demonstrated in 83.9% of the omadacycline- treated patients vs 80.5% of linezolid -treated patients, wit h a t reatment difference of 3.4% (95% CI, - 2.3 to 9.1). The efficacy and tolerability of sarecycline 1.5 mg/kg daily (administered as 60 mg, 100 mg, or 150 mg) were evaluat ed i n 2 phase 3, DB , PC, RCTs (Moore et al 2018, Seysara prescribing information 2018). Patients 9 to 45 years of age with moderate to severe acne were randomized to sarecycline or placebo once daily for 12 weeks.

The trials assessed the proportion of patients with success on the facial investigator's global assessment (IGA) (scores range from 0 [clear] to 4 [severe]), as well as assessing lesion counts. In the first trial, the proportions of patients achieving IGA success (defined as clear or almost clear and a 2-grade i mprovement from baseline) were 21.9% and 10.5% in the sarecycline and placebo groups, respectively (p < 0.0001). In the second trial, proportions were 22.6% and 15.3%, respectively (p = 0.0038). In the first trial, the mean absolute changes in inflammatory lesion counts were - 15.3 and - 10.2 for sarecycli ne and pl acebo, respectively (p < 0.001). In the second trial, changes were - 15.5 and - 11.1, respectively (p < 0.001). Improvements were also demonstrated for reductions in noninflammatory lesions and for IGA success on chest and bac k acne. CLINICAL GUIDELINES CABP Treatment recommendations from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and American Thoracic Society (ATS) recommend selection of empiric antimicrobial regimens based on prediction of the most likely pathogen(s) and k nowledge of local susceptibility patterns. Once the etiology of CABP has been identified via microbiological testing, antimicrobial therapy should be directed at that pathogen ( FDA multi -discipline review [Nuzyra] 2018, Mandell et al 2007). Regimens chosen by the IDSA/ATS guidelines mainly rely on macrolides (with or without a -lactam) or fluoroquinolones for outpatient therapy ( File 2018). The guidelines promote the use of macrolides to provide cover age f or both S. pneumoniae and atypical pathogens (particularly, M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae), which account for the majority of cases of CAP in ambulatory patients. The IDSA recommends IV vancomycin, oral or IV linezolid, or oral or IV clindamycin for community -acquired (CA) - methicillin -resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia if the strain is susceptible ( Liu et al 2011). ABSSSI The I DSA recommended the following in their 2014 practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of ski n and s oft tissue infections ( Stevens et al 2014): Nonpurulent skin and soft tissue infections ( SSTIs ): cellulitis/erysipelas/necrotizing infection Mild infection (ie, typical cellulitis/erysipelas with no focus of purulence) Patients with typical cases of cellulitis without systemic signs of infection should receive an antimicrobial agentthat is active against streptococci such as oral penicillin or amoxicillin, cephalosporin, dicloxacillin, or clindamycin. Moderate infection (ie, typical cellulitis/erysipelas with systemic signs of infection) For cellulitis with systemic signs of infection, IV antibiotics such as penicillin, ceftriaxone, cefazolin, o r c lindamycin are indicated. C overage against methicillin- susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) can be considered. Severe infection (ie, oral antibiotic failure, systemic signs of infection, immunocompromised patients, clinical signs of deeper infection [bullae, skin sloughing, hypotension, or evidence of organ dysfunction]) For patients whose cellulitis is associated with penetrating trauma, evidence of MRSA infection elsewhere, nasal colonization with MRSA, injection drug use, or systemic inflammatory response syndrome ( SIRS ), vancomycin or another antimicrobial effective against both MRSA and streptococci is recommended. In severely compromised patients, broad- spectrum antimicrobial coverage may be considered. Vancomycin plus either piperacillin/tazobactam or i mipenem /cilastin, or meropenem is recommended as a r for severe nonpurulent abscesses, and large furuncles) Incision and drainage is the recommended treatment. Moderate infection (ie, purulent infection with systemic signs of infection) The decision to administer antibiotics directed against S. aureus as an adjunct to incision and drainage should b e m ade based upon presence or absence of SIRS .

Clinic ians should refer to the full prescribing information and published resources when making medical decisions. Severe infection (ie, failure of incision and drainage plus oral antibiotics, systemic signs of infection, immunocompromised patients) An antibiotic active against MRSA is recommended for patients with carbuncles or abscesses who have fail ed i nitial antibiotic treatment or have markedly impaired host defenses or in patients with SIRS and hypotensi on. Empiric treatment options include vancomycin, telavancin, and ceftaroline. MRSA: any be considered. MSSA: nafcillin, cefazolin, or clindamycin. The Clinical practice guidelines by the IDSA for the treatment of MRSA infections recommend the following in adults an d c hildren ( Liu et al 2011): The following recommendations pertain only to the management of SSTI and pneumonia associated with MRSA disease. SSTIs For a cutaneous abscess, incision and drainage is the primary treatment . A ntibiotic therapy is recommended for abscesses associated with conditions such as severe or extensiv e di sease or rapid progression in presence of associated cellulitis, signs and symptoms of systemic illness, associated comorbidities or immu nosuppression, abscess in an area difficult to drain (eg, face and genitalia), associated septic phlebitis, and lack of response to incision and drainage alone. For outpatients with purulent cellulitis , empiric ended pendi therapy for infection due to -hemolytic streptococci is likely to be unnecessary . F or outpatients with nonpurulent cellulitis, empiric therapy for infection due to -hemolytic streptococci is recommended. Empiric coverage for CA -MRSA is recommended in patients who do not respond to -lactam therapy and may be considered in those with systemic toxicity. For empiric coverage of CA -MRSA in outpatients with SSTI, oral antibiotic options include clindamycin, S MX/ TM P , a t etracycline (doxycycline minocycline), and linezolid. If coverage for both -hemolytic streptococci and CA - MRSA is desired, options include clindamycin alone, S MX/ TM P or a tetracycline in combination with a -lactam (eg, amoxicillin), or linezolid alone. For children with minor skin infections (such as impetigo) and secondarily infected skin lesions (such as eczema, ulcers, or lacerations), mupirocin 2% topical ointment can be used. Tetracyclines should not be used in children < 8 years of age. Ac ne The American Academy of Dermatology published guidelines for the management of acne vulgaris in 2015. T he r ecommendations are as follows (Zaenglein et al 2016): Systemic antibiotics are recommended in the management of moderate and severe acne, and forms of inflammatoryacne that are resistant to topical treatments. Doxycycline and minocycline are considered more effective than tetracycline, but neither agent is consider ed s uperior over the other. Oral erythromycin and azithromycin can be effective; however, their use should be limited to patients who cannot use tetracyclines (eg, pregnant women or children < 8 years of age). Of note, erythromycin should be us ed c arefully, due to the increased risk of bacterial resistance. Systemic antibiotic use should be limited to the shortest possible duration, usually 3 months, in order to minimiz e t he risk of bacterial resistance. Monotherapy with systemic antibiotics is not recommended. Concomi tant topical therapy (eg, benzoyl peroxid e and/ or retinoid) should be used with systemic antibiotics, as well as maintenance after completion of systemic antibiotic therapy. S exually -transmitted disease s (STDs) The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) published treatment guidelines for the management of STDs in 2015. T he rec ommendations are listed below (CDC 2015 ).

Clinic ians should refer to the full prescribing information and published resources when making medical decisions. Doxycycline is recommended. Alternative agents include azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin or Lymphogranuloma venereum Doxycycline for 21 days is recommended. Erythromycin for 21 days is an alternative treatment option. Syphilis Penicillin G is the preferred drug for all stages of syphilis. Alternative agents include doxycycline and tetracycline. Azithromycin may be effective in early syphilis but should only be used when treatment with penicillin G or doxycycline is not feasible. Penicillin G is the only therapy recommended during pregnancy. Pregnant women with an allergy to penicilli n s hould be desensitized. Benzathine penicillin G is recommended for primary and secondary syphilis. Infants >1 month of age with primary or secondary syphilis should be treated with benzathine penicillin G. Patients with neurosyphilis should be treated with aqueous crystalline penicillin G. An alternative regimen i n pat ients in whom compliance can be assured is procaine penicillin plus probenecid Urethritis Azithromycin or include erythromycin, levofloxacin or ofloxacin. Azithromycin or amoxicillin is recommended in pregnant patients. An alternative agent is erythromycin. Gonococcal infections Dual therapy with ceftriaxone and azithromycin is preferred. If ceftriaxone is unavailable, then cefixime + azithromycin are an option. Pelvic inflammatory disease Recommended parenteral regimen A: cefotetan or cefoxitin plus plus doxycycline (oral or IV ). Outpatient oral therapy may be considered in patients with mild to moderate disease. Recommended regimens include ceftriaxone plus doxycycline with or without metronidazole, cefoxitin and probenecid plus doxycycline wit h or without metronidazole, or another parenteral third generation cephalosporin plus doxycycline with or without metronidazole. Epididymitis Ceftriaxone plus doxycycline is recommended. For acute infections most likely caused by enteric organisms, ceftriaxone + levofloxacin or ofloxacin are recommended. Proctitis Ceftriaxone + doxycycline are recommended. SAFETY SUMMARY The tetracyclines are contraindicated in patients hypersensitive to tetracyclines or any component in the formulations . Key warnings and precautions for t etracyclines : Tooth discoloration and enamel hypoplasia: U se during tooth development (ie, during the last half of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood up to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow -gray-brown) and enamel hypoplasia. Inhibition of bone growth: U se during the second and third trimester of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood up to t he age of 8 years may cause reversible inhibition of bone growth. C. difficile -associ ated diarrhea Photosensitivity : Skin protection and sun avoidance is recommended. Tetracyclines are generally considered safe; the most common adverse effects associated with this class ar e gas trointestinal in nature, eg, epigastric pain, anorexia, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.

Based on various treatment guidelines, the tetracyclines potentially play a role in the treatment of various infectiousdiseases based on their established susceptibility to certain microorganisms and FDA -approved indications. Within the class no major clinically significant differences exist among the various agents; however, doxycycli ne and m inocycline appear to be the most highly utilized. Tetracyclines have been associated with permanent tooth discoloration in children < 8 years of age if used repeatedly orfor prolonged courses, and with accumulation in fetal bones and teeth when administered to pregnant women. The newer generation tetracyclines (eg, doxycycline) are associated with a lower risk of dental staining when used 21 days in children. Doxycycline has not been correlated with teratogenic effects during pregnancy and is a treatment option when other agents appear less effective. Tetracycline antibiotics are relatively safe, with th e most common adverse events relating to gastrointestinal symptoms. Omadacycline, FDA -approved in 2018, provides an additional oral option for the treatment of ABSSSI due to MRSA, as well as a non- fluoroquinolone option 3 RCT demonstrated non- inferiority with omadacycline treatment vs an appropriate comparator (ie, moxifloxacin) for clinical success (ie, ECR) in patients with low - to moderate- risk pneumonia. In ABSSS I, 2 phase 3 RCTs demonstrated non- inferiority wit h omadacycline treatment vs an appropriate comparator (ie, linezolid) for clinical success (ie, ECR) in patients with moderate to severe skin infections. Sarecycline, also FDA -approved in 2018, is specifically indicated for inflammatory lesions of non- nodular moderate t o s evere acne vulgaris in patients 9 years of age. Sarecycline has demonstrated efficacy vs placebo for improving the severity of acne and decreasing lesion counts, and is well tolerated.

Therapeutic Class Overview Multiple Sclerosis Agents INTRODUCTION Multiple Sclerosis (MS), a chronic, immune- mediated disease of the central nervous system (CNS), is the leading cause of disability in young and middle- aged people in developed areas of the world (MS Coalition 2018) . MS i s characterized by repeated episodes of inflammation within the brain and spinal cord, resulting in injury to the myelin sheaths that surround and insulate nerves, and subsequently the nerve cell axons (Goodin et al 2002) . There are 4 clinical subtypes of MS: oRelapsing- remitting MS (RRMS), which is characterized by acute attacks followed by partial or full recovery. This is the most common form of MS, accounting for 80 to 85% of cases. oSecondary progressive MS (SPMS) begins as RRMS; however, the attack rate declines over time. Patients experience a gradual deterioration. Patients with RRMS for more than 10 years may transition to SPMS. oPrimary progressive MS (PPMS) occurs in approximately 10% of patients with MS. Patients have a continuous andgradual decline in function without evidence of acute attacks. oClinically isolated syndrome (CIS) refers to the first episode of neurologic symptoms that lasts at least 24 hours and is caused by inflammation or demyelination in the CNS (Goodin et al 2002, Sanvito et al 2011, National MS Society 2019[a] ). A more recent revision of the MS clinical course descriptions recommended that the core MS phenotype descriptions of relapsing and progressive disease be retained with some of the following modifications: (1) an important modifier of these core phenotypes is an assessment of disease activity, as defined by clinical assessment of relapse occurrence or lesion activity detected by CNS imaging; (2) the second important modifier of these phenotypes is a determination of whether progression of disability has occurred over a given time period; and (3) the prior category of PRMS can beeliminated since subjects so categorized would now be classified as PP MS patients with disease activity (Lublin et al 2014) . An estimated 1 million adults in the United States have been diagnosed with MS. Most patients are diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 50 years, and MS is reported more frequently in women than in men (N ational MS Society 2019[b]) . Diagnosis of MS requires evidence of damage in at least 2 separate areas of the CNS, evidence of damage that occurred at 2 separate time points at least 1 month apart, and that other possible diagnoses have been ruled out. The clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) includes 1 attack and objective evidence of 1 lesion (Thompson et al 2018) . Following CIS, the course of MS is variable. The inclusion of CIS in the spectrum of MS phenotypes with prospective follow -up of most such patients determining their subsequent disease phenotype was also recommended in the recent revision of the MS clinical course descriptions (Lublin et al 2014) . Disease- modifying therapies (DMTs) delay the development from CIS to clinically definite MS (CDMS) (Miller et al 2012, Armoiry et al 2018) . Evaluation includes an extensive patient history, neurological examination, laboratory tests to rule out other possible causes, magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) to evaluate for new disease and signs of more chronic damage, and possibly lumbar puncture ( Thompson et al 2018) . Exacerbations, also known as flares, relapses, or attacks of MS are caused by inflammation in the CNS that leads to damage to the myelin and slows or blocks transmission of nerve impulses. An exacerbation must last at least 24 hours and be separated from a previous exacerbation by at least 30 days. Exacerbations can be mild or severe. Intravenous (IV) corticosteroids may be used to treat severe exacerbations of MS. Corticosteroids decrease acute inflammation in the CNS but do not provide any long- term benefits (Frohman et al 2007) . The approach to treating MS includes the management of symptoms, treatment of acute relapses and utilization of DMTs to reduce the frequency and severity of relapses , reduce lesions on MRI scans, and possibly delay disease and disability progression ( Rae-Grant et al 2018[b] ). The American Academy of Neurology (AAN) , the European Committee for Research and Treatment of Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS) and the European Academy of Neurology (EAN) recently updated their guidelines on MS. Both guidelines recommend initiation of DMT s treatment early on in the patient's disease course ( Rae Grant et al 2018[b] , Montalban et al 2018).

Clinic ians should refer to the full prescribing information and published resources when making medical decisions. British Neurologists guidelines support access to the available DMTs for patients with MS. While there are no precise algorithms to determine the order of product selection, therapy should be individualized and patients' clinical response and tolerability to medications should be monitored (Corboy et al 2015, Goodin et al 2002, MS Coalition 2017, Scolding et al 2015). Pediatric -onset MS is rare, with the vast majority of cases demonstrating a relapsing remitting disease course ( Otallah et al 2018) . Gilenya (fingolimod) is the first FDA -approved agent for pediatric patients. Its approval was based on t he PAR ADIGMS trial ( Chitnis ada ( alemtuzumab) are all currently being evaluated in pediatric patients in P hase 3 trials.

CLINICAL EFFICACY SUMMARY In the management of MS, numerous clinical trials have established the safety and efficacy of the biologic respons e m odifiers in reducing the frequency of relapses lesions on MRI scans, and possibly delaying disease progressi on and d isability.

Patients should always seek the advice of a physician or other qualified health pr ovider with any ques tions regarding a medic al condition. Clinic ians should refer to the full prescribing information and published resources when making medical decisions. Pivotal clinical trials demonstrating efficacy in reducing the rate of relapses, burden of disease on MRI, and disability progression for the interferons and glatiramer acetate were published in the 1990's (Jacobs et al 1996, Johnson et al , 1995 , The inter feron beta [ IFN] Multiple Sclerosis Study Group 1993, The IFN Multiple Sclerosis Study Group 1995) . Long -term follow -up data for IFN -1b show that overall survival in MS is improved (Goodin et al 2012) . Head- to-head omparable in terms of relapse rate reduction and disease and disability progression (PRISMS 1998, Kappos et al 2006, Mikol et al 2008, Flechter et al 2002, Cadavid et al 2009, O'Connor et al 2009) . The results of several studies suggest that lower dose Avonex (IFN -1a 30 mcg intramuscular [ IM] once weekly) may be less efficacious while being mor e tol erable compared to higher dose Rebif (IFN -1a subcutaneous [ SC] 3 times weekly or every other day) or glatiramer acetate (Khan et al 2001[a] , Khan et al 2001[b] , Barbero et al 2006, Durelli et al 2002, Panitch et al 2002, Panitch et al 2005, Schwid et al 2005, Schwid et al 2007, Traboulsee et al 2008) . In a meta- analysi s of 5 randomized studies comparing IFNs with glatiramer acetate, there were no significant differences between IFNs and glatiramer acetate in terms of the number of patients with relapses, confirmed progression, or discontinuation due to adverse events at 24 months (La Mantia et al 2016) . oAt 36 months, however, evidence from a single study suggested that relapse rates were higher in the group giv en IF Ns than in the glatiramer acetate group (risk ratio [ RR] 1.40, 95% confidence interval [ CI]: 1.13 to 1.74; p = 0.002). While MRI outcomes analysis showed that effects on newer enlarging T2 or new contrast -enhancing T1 lesions at 24 months were similar, the reduction in T2- and T1- weighted lesion volume was significantly greater in the groups given IFNs than in the glatiramer acetate groups (mean difference [ MD] 0.58, 95% CI: 0.99 to 95% CI: 0.33 to 0.07; p = 0.003, respectively). In a network meta- analysis of 24 studies comparing IFNs and glatiramer acetate, both drugs were found to reduce t he annual ized relapse rate (ARR) as compared to placebo but did not differ statistically from each other ( Melendez -Torres et al 2018). Ranking of the drugs based on SUCRA (surface under the cumulative ranking curve) indicated that glatiramer acetate 20 mg once daily had the highest probability for superiority, followed by peginterferon -1a 125 mc g ev ery 2 weeks. A meta- analysis of 6 placebo- controlled trials failed to find a significant advantage of Avonex (IFN -1a) 30 mcg IM onc e w eekly compared to placebo in the number of relapse- free patients after 1 year of therapy ( Freedman et al 2008). In contrast, other studies found Avonex (IFN -1a) 30 mcg IM once weekly to be comparable to the other IFN products i n t erms of relapse rate reduction, disability progression, and SPMS development (Carra et al 2008, Limmroth et al 2007, Minagara et al 2008, Rio et al 2005, Trojano et al 2003, Trojano et al 2007) . Moreover, IFN therapy, especially the higher dose products, is associated with the production of neutralizing antibodies (NAb), which may result in decreas ed r adiographic and clinical effectiveness of treatment (Goodin et al 2007, Sorensen et al 2005) . Exploratory post -hoc analyses of the PRISMS trial linked the development of NAb with reduced efficacy (Alsop et al 2005) . Development of NAb among patients (N = 368) randomized to receive R ebif (IFN -1a) 44 or 22 mcg SC 3 times weekly for 4 years was associated with higher relapse rates (adjusted relapse rate ratio, 1.41; 95% CI : 1.12 to 1.78; p = 0.004), a greater number of active lesions, and percentage change in T2 lesion burden from baseline on MRI scan ( p < 0.001). I n a s ystematic review of 40 studies of MS agents including IFN -1a and IFN -1b, the primary outcome measure was t he f requency of IFN NAb (Govindappa et al 2015) . NAb development was most frequent with IFN -1b, followed by IFN - 1a SC, and lowest with IFN -1a IM. Higher doses were associated with a higher rate of NAb development. The CombiRx trial evaluated the combination of Copaxone (glatiramer acetate) and Avonex (IFN -1a IM) over 3 years. The ARR for the combination therapy (IFN -1a + glatiramer) was not statistically superior to the better of the 2 singl e t reatment arms (glati ramer) (p = 0.27). The ARR s were 0.12 for the combination therapy, 0.16 for IFN -1a, and 0.11 for glatiramer acetate. Glatiramer acetate performed significantly better than IFN -1a, reducing the risk of exacerbation by = 0.027), and IFN -1a glatir amer acetate performed significantly better than IFN -1a, reducing the risk of exacerbation by 25% ( p = 0.022). The 3 treatment groups did not show a significant difference in disability progressi on ov er 6 months. Combination therapy was superior to either monotherapy in reducing new lesion activity and ac cumulation of total lesion volume (Lublin et al 2013) . It is estimated that within a few years of initiating treatment, at least 30 and 15% of patients discontinue MS biological response modifiers due to perceived lack of efficacy or side effects, respectively (Coyle 2008, Portaccio et al 2008) . A ccording to several observational studies, switching patients who have failed to adequately respond to initial treatment to another first -line therapy is safe and effective (Caon et al 2006, Zwibel 2006, Carra et al 2008) . Patients switching t o gl atiramer acetate after experiencing inadequate response to IFN -1a therapy experienced a reduction in relapse rates and disability progression. Likewise, switching to IFN -1a therapy after suboptimal efficacy with glatiramer acetat eData as of April 11, 2019 PK-S /ALS/KR Page 74 This information is cons idered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

The smallest reduction in the ARR was seen in patients who had switched from one IFN -1a preparation to another. The GALA study evaluated glatiramer acetate SC 40 mg 3 times w eekly compared to placebo in 1404 patients wit h r elapsing MS over 12 months. Results demonstrated that glatiramer acetate 40 mg 3 times weekly, compared t o pl acebo, reduced the ARR and MRI endpoints (Kha n et al 2013) . Glatiramer acetate 20 mg daily and 40 mg 3 times weekly have not been directly compared for efficacy. A Phase 3 dos e c omparison study evaluated glatiramer acetate 20 mg and 40 mg each given daily in 1155 patients with MS. T he pr imary endpoint, mean ARR, was similar in both groups : ARR = 0.33 (20 mg group) vs ARR = 0.35 ( 40 mg group). For patients from both groups who completed the entire 1- year treatment period, the mean ARR = 0.27 (Comi et al 2011) . The efficacy and safety of Plegridy (peginterferon -1a) in adult patients with MS (N = 1516) were evaluated i n A DVANCE, a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, placebo- controlled trial. Eligible adult patients had RRMS with baseline Expanded Disability Status Scale ( EDSS ) score 5 and 2 clinically documented relapses in the previous 3 years with at least 1 relapse in the previous 12 months. Patients were randomized to placebo or SC peginterferon -1a 125 mc g ev ery 2 weeks or every 4 weeks for 48 weeks. Approximately 81% of patients were treatment na\u00efve. oAt week 48, ARR s were significantly lower in the peginterferon -1a every 2 week group (ARR = 0.256; p = 0.0007) and peginterferon -1a every 4 week group (ARR = 0.288; p = 0.0114) compared to placebo (ARR = 0.397). oThere were also significant differences between the peginterferon -1a ev ery 2 weeks and every 4 weeks groups compared to placebo in the proportion of patients with relapse at week 48 ( p = 0.0003 and p = 0.02, respectively). The proportions of patients with 12 weeks of sustained disability progression at the end of the 48 week study peri od we re significantly lower in the peginterferon -1a groups (both 6.8%; p = 0.0383 for every 2 weeks group; p = 0.038 f or every 4 weeks group) compared to placebo (10.5%). oThe mean number of new or newly enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions on MRI were significantly reduced in t he pegi nterferon -1a every 2 weeks group compared to placebo (3.6 lesions vs 10.9 lesions, respectively; p < 0.0001). Significant beneficial effects on the mean number of Gadolinium (Gd)- enhancing lesions were also observed with peginterferon -1a every 2 weeks compared to placebo ( p < 0.0001). oDuring the 48 weeks of treatment, the most commonly reported adverse effects included influenza- like illness and i njection site erythema. Discontinuations due to adverse effects were higher in the peginterferon -1a groups compared to placebo (Calabresi et al 2014b) . oNAb to interferon -1a were identified in < 1% of all groups after 1 year (peginterferon -1a every 2 weeks, 4 pat ients; peginterferon -1a every 4 weeks, 2 patients; placebo, 2 patients) (Calabresi et al 2014b) . Preliminary dat a on NAb dev elopment to peginterferon -1a over 2 years show ed < 1% for all groups (White et al 2014) . The ADVANCE study continued into a second year. Patients originally randomized to placebo were re- randomized to peginterferon -1a (the \"placebo- switch group\"). on their original assi gned t herapy. A total of 1332 patients entered the second year of the study. After 96 weeks, the ARR was significantly lower in the peginterferon -1a every 2 weeks group (ARR 0.221; p = 0.0001 vs placebo- switch group; p = 0.0209 vs every 4 w eek regimen) compared to both the placebo-s witch group (ARR 0.351) and the peginterferon -1a every 4 week gr oup (AR R 0.291). The peginterferon -1a every 4 week group (ARR 0.291; p = NS vs placebo- switch group) was not significantly different than the placebo- switch group (ARR 0.351) after 96 weeks based on the intent -to-treat (ITT ) anal ysis. Peginterferon -1a every 2 weeks was also associated with a lower proportion of patients who had relapse an d a l ower proportion of patients who had disability progression. Mean number of new or newly enlarging T2-weight hyperintense MRI lesions over 2 years w as numerically lower with the peginterferon -1a every 2 weeks gr oup c ompared to the placebo- switch group (Calabresi et al 2014b , Kieseier et al 2015) . The ATTAIN study was an open- label extension of the ADVANCE study, where patients were followed for an additional 2 years ( Newsome et al 2018). Of the original ADVANCE patients, 71% continued into the ATTAIN study , and 78% of those patients completed the extension study. The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the long- term safety of peginterferon -1a. During the study, the common adverse events were influenza- like illness (43%), injection sit e er ythema (41%), and headache (29%). The rate of treatment -related serious adverse events was 1%. The adjuste d A RR and risk of relapse was reduced significantly with the every 2 weeks compared to the every 4 weeks dosing gr oup ( large, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in adults against plac ebo and agai nst Avonex (IFN -1a IM). In FREEDOMS, a 24- month placebo- controlled trial, fingolimod (0.5 and 1.25 mg onc e dai ly) was associated with significant reductions in ARR compared to placebo (54 and 60%, respectively; p < 0.001 forData as of April 11, 2019 PK-S /ALS/KR Page 75 This information is cons idered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Moreover, fingolimod was associated with reductions in disability progression and a prolonged time to first relapse compared to placebo (Kappos et al 2010) . In the 12- month TRANSFORMS trial, fingolimod 0.5 and 1.25 mg once daily significantly reduced ARR by 52 and 40%, respectively, compared to IFN -1a 30 mcg IM once weekly ( p < 0.001 for both) (Cohen et al 2010) . In a 12- month ex tension of TRANSFORMS, patients initially randomized to IFN -1a IM were switched to either dose of fingolimod for 12 additional months and experienced significant reductions in ARR compared to initial treatment with IFN -1a IM. Patients switched from IFN -1a IM to fingolimod experienced fewer adverse events compared to treatment with IFN -1a IM in the core study (86 vs 91% and 91 vs 94% for the 0.5 and 1.25 mg groups, respectively; p values not reported). Fewer patients continuing fingolimod from the core study reported adverse events in the extension period compared to the core study (72 vs 86% and 71 vs 90% for the 0.5 and 1.25 mg doses, respectively; p values not reported) ( Khatri et al 2011) . The TRANSFORMS extension study followed patients for up to 4.5 years with results consistent with those observed in the first 12 months of the extension study; however, there was significant attrition bias with very few patients enrolled past 36 months (Cohen et al 2015) . In the FREEDOMS II study, a 24- month placebo- controlled study, fingolimod (0.5 mg and 1.25 mg) significantly reduc ed A RR compared to placebo (48 and 50%, respectively; both p < 0.0001) (Calabresi et al 2014a) . Mean percentage brai n v olume change was lower with both fingolimod doses compared to placebo. Fingolimod did not show a significant effect on time to disability progression at 3 months compared to placebo. Fingolimod has also been evaluated in pediatric patients with relapsing MS ( Chitnis et al 2018). The PARADIGMS trial randomized patients between 10 and 17 years of age to fingolimod 0.5 mg daily (0.25 mg for patients 40 kg) or IFN - 1a IM 30 mcg weekly for up to 2 years. Fingolimod signif icantly reduced ARR compared to IFN -1a IM (adjusted rates, 0.12 vs 0.67; relative difference of 82%; p < 0.001). Fingolimod was also associated with a 53% relative reduction in t he annual ized rate of new or newly enlarged lesions. However, serious adverse events occurred more frequently wit h f ingolimod than IFN -1a IM (16.8% vs 6.5%). Aubagio (teriflunomide) Efficacy and safety of Aubagio were evaluated in two Phase 3, randomized, double- blind, placebo- controlled trials - the T EMSO trial ( O'Connor et al, 2011) and the TOWER trial (Confavreux et al 2014) . In the TEMSO trial, 1088 patients wit h r elapsing MS were randomized to teriflunomide 7 mg or 14 mg daily or placebo for a total of 108 weeks. Results demonstrated that compared to placebo, teriflunomide at both doses, reduced the ARR. oThe percentage of patients with confirmed disability progression (CDP) was significantly lower only in t he t eriflunomide 14 mg group (20.2%) compared to placebo (27.3%; p = 0.03) (O'Connor et al 2011) . Teriflunomide has demonstrated beneficial effects on MRI scans in a Phase 2, randomized, double- blind, clinical trial. A total of 179 patients with MS were randomized to teriflunomide 7 mg or 14 mg daily or placebo for 36 weeks and wer e f ollowed every 6 weeks with MRI scans during the treatment period. The teriflunomide groups had significant reductions in the average number of unique active lesions per MRI scan ( O'Connor et al 2006) . In the TOWER trial, 1165 patients with relapsing MS were randomized to teriflunomide 7 mg or 14 mg daily or plac ebo f or at least 48 weeks of therapy. The study ended 48 weeks after the last patient was randomized. Results demonstrated that, compared to placebo, teriflunomide 14 mg significantly reduced the ARR and the risk of sustai ned ac cumulation of disability (Confavreux et al 2014) . Teriflunomide and R ebif were compared in the 48- week TENERE study evaluating 324 patients with relapsing MS. T he pr imary outcome, time to failure defined as a confirmed relapse or permanent discontinuation for any cause, was comparable for teriflunomide 7 mg and 14 mg and R ebif P hase 3 studies: DEFINE and CONFIRM (Gold et al 2012, Fox et al 2012, Xu et al 2015) . DEFINE was a multicenter RCT that compared 2 dosing regimens of dimethyl fumarate (240 m g t wice daily and 240 mg 3 times daily) to placebo in patients with RRMS. There were 1237 patients enrolled, and the trial duration was 96 weeks. Results demonstrated that, compared to placebo, treatment with both doses of dimethyl fumarate reduc ed the proportion of patients with a relapse within 2 years , the ARR , the number of lesions on MRI, and t he proportion of patients with disability progression (Gold et al 2012) . CONFIRM was a multicenter RCT that compared 2 dosing regimens of dimethyl fumarate (240 mg twice daily and 240 m g 3 times daily) to placebo, with an additional, open- label study arm evaluating glatiramer acetate 20 mg SC daily. Glatiramer acetate was included as a reference comparator, but the study was not designed to test the superiority o r non -inferiority of dimethyl fumarate vs glatiramer acetate. There were 1430 patients enrolled, and the trial duration was 96 weeks. Results of CONFIRM were similar to DEFINE, with the exception that there was no significant differenc eData as of April 11, 2019 PK-S /ALS/KR Page 76 This information is cons idered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

The CONFIRM trial demonstrated that, compared to placebo, treatment with both doses of dimethyl fumarate reduced the proportion of patients with a relapse within 2 years , the ARR, and the number of lesions on MRI (Fox et al 2012) . Tysabri (natalizumab) Tysabri (natalizumab) reduced the risk of experiencing at least 1 new exacerbation at 2 years and reduced the risk of experiencing progression at 2 years (Polman et al 2006, Pucci et al 2011, Rudick et al 2006) . The AFFIRM trial compared natalizumab to placebo in patients with MS with less than 6 months of treatment experience with any DMT . N atalizumab reduced the ARR at 1 and 2 years compared to placebo. The cumulative probability of sustained disability progression and lesion burden on MRI were significantly reduced with natalizumab compared to placebo (Polman et al2006) . In the SENTINEL trial, natalizumab was compared to placebo in patients who were receiving IFN -1a IM 30 mc g onc e weekly for at least 1 year. The combination of natalizumab plus IFN-1a IM resulted in a significant reduction i n A RR at year 1 and 2 and significant reduction in cumulative probability of sustained disability progression at year 2 . Les ion burden on MRI was also significantly reduced with the combination therapy. Two cases of PML were reported i n t he SENTINEL patient population resulting in the early termination of the trial (Rudick et al 2006) . Lemtrada (alemtuzumab) The efficacy and safety of alemtuzumab were to R ebif (IFN -1a SC) in two randomized, Phase 3, open- label trials in patients with relapsing forms of MS - CARE -MS I and CARE -MS II ( Cohen et al 2012, Coles et al 2012) . In the 2-y ear studies, patients were randomized to alemtuzumab infused for 5 consecutive days followed by a 3 consecutiv e day treatment course 12 months later or to R ebif (IFN -1a SC) 44 mcg 3 times weekly after an initial dosage titration. All patients received methylprednisolone 1 g IV for 3 consecutive days at the initiation of treatment and at month 12. oThe CARE -MS I trial enrolled treatment -na\u00efve patients with MS ( n = 581) who were high functioning based on t he r equirement of a score of 3 or lower on the EDSS. oPatients ( n = 840) enrolled in the CARE -MS II trial had experienced at least 1 relapse while on IFN or glatiramer acetate after at least 6 months of treatment. Patients were required to have an EDSS score of 5. oThe co- primary endpoints for both trials were the relapse rate and the time to 6- month sustained accumulation of disability. oIn the CARE -MS I trial, alemtuzumab reduced the risk of relapse by 55% com IFN -1a Relapses treated patients and 40% of IFN -1a SC patients over 2 years. T he pr oportion of patients having sustained accumulation of disability over 6 months was not significantly different between alemtuzumab (8%) vs IFN -1a SC (11%) (p the CARE -MS II trial, alemtuzumab significantly reduced relapse rate and sustained accumulation of disability compared to IFN -1a SC. The relapse rate at 2 years was reduced by 49% with alemtuzumab (p < 0.0001). T he per cent of patients with sustained accumulation of disability confirmed over 6 months was 13% with alemtuzum ab and 20% with IFN alemtuzumab ( p = 0.0084). oBoth studies evaluated MRI outcomes, specifically the median percent change in T2 hyperintense lesion volume frombaseline. Neither study found a significant difference between the 2 drugs for this measure. oDuring extension studies of CARE -MS I and CARE -MS II , approximately 80% of patients previously treated wit h al emtuzumab did not require additional treatment during the first year ( Garnock -Jones 2014) . A Cochrane review by Zhang et al (2017) that compared the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of alemtuzumab vs IFN- 1a i n the treatment of RRMS identified 3 RCTs in 1694 total patients from the CARE -MS I, CARE -MS II , and CAMMS 223 s tudies . In the alemtuzumab 12 mg/day group, the results showed statistically significant differences in reduci ng r elapses (RR = 0.60, 95% CI: 0.52 0.70); preventing disease progression (RR = 0.60, 95% CI: 0.45 to 0.79) ; and dev eloping new T2 lesions on MRI (RR = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.61 to 0.93) after 24 and 36 months' follow -up, but f ound no s tatistically significant difference in the changes of EDSS score ( MD = - 0.35, 95% CI: - 0.73 to 0.03). In the alemtuzuma b 24 m g/day group, the results showed statistically significant differences in reducing relapses (RR = 0.38, 95% CI : 0.23 t o 0. 62); preventing disease progression (RR = 0.42, 95% CI : 0.21 to 0.84) ; and the changes of EDSS score (MD = -0.83, 95% CI : -1.17 to - 0.49) after 36 months' follow -up. The most frequently reported adverse effects with alemtuzumab wer e i nfusion- associated reactions, infections, and autoimmune events. Ocrevus (ocrelizumab) The Phase 3 clinical development program for ocrelizumab (ORCHESTRA) included 3 studies: OPERA I, OPERA II, and OR ATORIO (Hauser et al 2017[a], Montalban et al 2017) .Data as of April 11, 2019 PK-S /ALS/KR Page 77 This information is cons idered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Clinic ians should refer to the full prescribing information and published resources when making medical decisions. oOPERA I and OPERA II were 2 identically -designed, 96-w eek, Phase multicenter , parallel RCTs that evaluated the efficacy and safety of ocrelizumab (600 m g adm inistered as an IV infusion given as 2- 300 mg infusions separated by 2 weeks for dose 1 and then as a singl e 600 m g infusion every 6 months for subsequent doses) compared with Rebif (IFN -1a; 44 mcg administered by SC injection 3 times per week) in 1656 patients with RMS (Hauser et al 2017, ClinicalTrials.gov Web site, Ocrevus Formulary Submission Dossier 2017) . A cross both studies, the majority of patients had not been treated with a DMT in the 2 years before screeni ng ( range: 71.4% to 75.3%); of those patients that had received a previous DMT as allowed by the protocol, most received IFN (18.0% to 21.0%) or glatiramer acetate (9.0% to 10.6%). Two patients previously treated wit h nat alizumab for < 1 year were included, while 5 patients previously treated with fingolimod and 1 patient previously treated with dimethyl fumarate (both not within 6 months of screening) were also included. Ocrelizumab achieved statistically significant reductions in the ARR vs Rebif across both trials (primary endpoint). OPERA I (0.16 vs 0.29; 46% lower rate with ocrelizumab; p < 0.001) OPERA II (0.1 6 vs 0.29; 47% lower rate; p < 0.001) In pre- specified pooled analyses (secondary endpoints), the percentage of patients with disability progressi on c onfirmed at 12 weeks was statistically significantly lower with ocrelizumab vs Rebif (9. 1% vs 13.6%; hazard rati HR] 0.60, 95% CI: 0.45 to 0.81; p < 0.001). The results were similar for disability progression confirmed at 24 w eeks: 6.9% vs 10.5%; HR = 0.60, 95% CI: 0.43 to 0.84; p = 0.003. The percentages of patients with disability improvement confirmed at 12 weeks were 20.7% in the ocrelizumab group vs 15.6% in the Rebif group (33% higher rate of improvement with ocrelizumab; p = 0.02). The mean numbers of Gd- enhancing lesions per T1- weighted MRI scan were statistically significantly reduced wit h oc relizumab vs Rebif (secondary endpoint). OPE RA 95% CI: to 0.10; p < 0.001) OPER A II: 0.02 vs 0.42 ratio CI: 0.03 to 0.09; 95% lower number of lesions; p < 0.001) The most common adverse events were infusion- related reactions and infections. oNo opportunistic infections, including PML, were reported in any group over the duration of either trial. An imbalance of malignancies was observed with ocrelizumab; across both studies and through 96 weeks, neoplas ms occurred in 0.5% (4/825) of ocrelizumab- treated patients 0.2% (2/826) of Rebif -treated patients. Among the ocrelizumab- treated patients that developed neoplasms, there were 2 cases of invasive ductal breast carcinoma, 1 case of renal -cell carcinoma, and 1 case of malignant melanoma. Rebif -treated patients wit h neopl asms included 1 case of mantle- cell lymphoma and 1 case of squamous -cell carcinoma in the chest. Between the clinical cutoff dates of the 2 trials (April 2, 2015 [OPERA I] and May 12, 2015 [OPERA II]) and J une 30, 2016, 5 additional cases of neoplasm (2 cases of breast cancer, 2 cases of basal -cell skin carcinoma, and 1 c ase of malignant melanoma) were observed during the OL extension phase in which all continuing patients received ocrelizumab. oORATORIO was an event -driven, Phase 3, double- blind, multicenter , placebo- controlled, RCT evaluating the efficacy and safety of ocrelizumab (600 mg administered by IV infusion every 6 months; given as 2- 300 mg infusions 2 weeks apart for each dose) compared with placebo in 732 people with PPMS (Montalban et al 2017, ClinicalTrials.gov Submission Dossier 2017) . Double- blind treatment was administered for a minimum of 5 doses (120 weeks) until the occurrence of ~253 events of disability progression in the trial cohort that was confirm ed f or at least 12 weeks. The majority of patients (~88%) reported no previous use of DMTs within 2 years of trial entry. The proportion o f pat ients with Gd- enhancing lesions was similar (27.5% in the ocrelizumab group vs 24.7% in the placebo group); however, there was an imbalance in the mean number of Gd- enhancing lesions at baseline, with nearly 50% fewer lesions in the placebo group (1.21 vs 0.6) ( FDA Medical and Summary Reviews 2017). The percentages of patients with 12- week confirmed disability progression (primary endpoint) were 32.9% wit h oc relizumab vs 39.3% (HR = 0.76, 95% CI: 0.59 to 0.98; relative risk reduction of 24%; p = 0.03). The percentages of patients with 24- week CDP (secondary endpoint) were 29.6% to 0.98; relative risk reduction of 25%; p = 0.04). Additional secondary endpoints included changes in the timed 25- foot walk, the total volume of hyperintense brai n l esions on T2- weighted MRI, and brain volume loss.Data as of April 11, 2019 PK-S /ALS/KR Page 78 This information is cons idered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

The proportion of patients with 20% worsening of the timed 25- foot walk confirmed at 12 weeks was 49% i n oc relizumab- treated patients compared to 59% in placebo- treated patients (25% risk reduction). From baseline to Week 120, the total volume of hyperintense brain lesions on T2- weighted MRI decreased by 3.37% in ocrelizumab- treated patients and increased by 7.43% in placebo- treated patients (p < 0.001). From Weeks 24 to 120, the percentage of brain volume loss was 0.90% with ocreli zumab vs 1.09% with placebo (p = 0.02). Infusion- related reactions, upper respiratory tract infections, and oral herpes infections occurred more frequently with ocrelizumab vs placebo. Neoplasms occurred in 2.3% (11/486) of patients treated with ocrelizumab vs 0.8% (2/239) of patients w ho r eceived placebo. Among the ocrelizumab- treated patients that developed neoplasms, there were 4 cases of breast cancer, 3 cases of basal -cell carcinoma, and 1 case in each of the following: endometrial adenocarcinoma, anaplastic large- histiocytoma, and pancreatic carcinoma. In t he pl acebo group, 1 patient developed cervical adenocarcinoma in situ and 1 patient developed basal -cell carcinoma. Between the clinical cutoff date (July 24, 2015) and June 30, 2016, 2 additional cases of neoplasm (1 case of basal -cell skin carcinoma and 1 case of squamous -cell carcinoma) were detected during the open- label extension phase in which all patients received ocrelizumab. Mayzent (siponimod) The Phase 3 trial, EX PAND blind, randomized, parallel -group, placebo- controlled, time- to-event study i n patients with SPMS who had evidence of disability progression in the previous 2 year s (Bar-Or et al 2018, Fox et al 2015, Kappos et al 2018). oA total of 1651 patients were randomized to treatment with either siponimod 2 mg (n = 1105) or placebo ( n = 546). oA total of 82% of the siponimod- treated patients and 78% of placebo- treated patients completed the study. The m edian age of patients was 49.0 years, 95% of patients were white, and 60% were female. For the primary endpoint, 288 (26%) of 1096 patients receiving siponimod and 173 (32%) of 545 patients receivi ng placebo had a 3- month CDP (HR 0.79: 95% CI: 0.65 to 0.95: RR reduction, 21%; p = 0.013). Key secondary endpoints included time to 3- month confirmed worsening of at least 20% from baseline in T25FW an d change from baseline in T2 lesion volume on MRI. Siponimod did not show a significant difference in T25FW. Patients treated with siponimod had a 55% relative reduction in ARR (0.071 vs 0.16), compared to placebo ( nominal p < 0.01) . The absolute reduction in the ARR was 0.089 with siponimod. Mavenclad (cladribine) The 96-week Phase a double- blind, 3-arm, placebo- controlled, multicenter trial to evaluate t he safety and efficacy of oral cladribine in 1326 patients with RRMS (Giovannoni et al 2010, Giovannoni 2017). oPatients were required to have at least 1 relapse in the previous 12 months. The median patient age was 39 years and the female- to-male ratio was 2:1. The mean duration of MS prior to study reenrollment was 8.7 years. oPatients were randomized to receive either placebo (n = 437), or a cumulative oral dose of cladribine 3.5 mg/ kg (n = 433) or 5.25 mg/ kg (n = 456) over the 96- week study period in 2 treatment courses. oThe primary outcome was ARR . oARRs at 96 weeks were reduced in both cladribine treatment groups v s placebo (0.14, 0.15, and 0.33 in the 3. 5 mg/kg, 5.25 mg/kg and placebo groups, respectively; each p < 0.001) . oA significantly higher percentage of patients remained relapse- free at 96 weeks both in the cladribine treatment groups vs placebo; a total of 79.7% and 78.9% of patients in the 3.5 mg/kg and 5.25 mg/kg groups, respectively, were relapse free vs 60.9% in the placebo group (each p < 0.001 vs placebo) . oCladribine 3.5 mg/kg significant ly lower ed the ARR vs t he 5.25 mg/kg treatment group. Symptomatic MS Despite the demonstrated efficacy of DMTs, for many patients there is little evidence of their effect on quality of lif e ( QOL) in general or symptom management in particular. Impaired mobility contributes to direct and indirect costs (Miravelle et al 2011) . oAmpyra (dalfampridine) is the only FDA -approved agent for the symptomatic treatment of impaired mobility i n pat ients with MS. Improvement of walking ability with dalfampridine was demonstrated in two 14- week, double- blind, Phase 3, RCTs of 540 patients of all MS types. Compared to placebo, dalfampridine significantly improved t heData as of April 11, 2019 PK-S /ALS/KR Page 79 This information is cons idered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

To address the benefit of long- term therapy wit h dal fampridine, an open- label, observational study of 52 MS patients with impaired mobility was conducted. Results demonstrated that about 60% of patients were still on treatment after 9 to 12 months. Two weeks after treatment initiation, significant ameliorations could be found for T25FW, maximum walking distance, as well as motoric and c ognitive fatigue, which persisted after 9 to 12 months (Ruck et al 2014) . Clinically Isolated Syndrome (CIS) Avonex -1a IM) and Betaseron (IFN -1b) are FDA -approved for the treatment of the first clinical episode with MRI features consistent with MS. Copaxone (glatiramer acetate) and Aubagio (teriflunomide) have evidence supporti ng a s ignificant delay in the time to development of a second exacerbation, compared to placebo, in patients with an isolate d dem yelinating event. In the PRECISE trial, glatiramer acetate significantly reduced the risk of converting to a CDMS diagnosis by 45% compared to placebo in patients with CIS ( p = 0.005). In addition, the time for 25% of patients to convert to CDMS wa s s ignificantly prolonged with glatiramer acetate compared to placebo (722 vs 336 days; p = 0.0041) (Comi et al 2009) . In the 2 year, open- label extension phase of PRECISE, early initiation of glatiramer acetate demonstrated a 41% reduc ed r isk of Over the 2 year extension, the baseline- adjusted proportions of patients who developed CDMS were 29.4% and 46.5% for the early and l ate initiation treatment groups (odds ratio [ OR]: 0.48; 95% CI: 0.33 to 0.7; . A meta- analysis of randomized, double- blind, placebo- controlled trials in patients with CIS found a significantly lower risk of CDMS with IFN therapy compared to placebo ( p < 0.0001) (Clerico et al 2008) . A 10- year, multicenter, randomiz ed c linical trial with IFN -1a IM demonstrated that immediate initiation of therapy in patients with CIS reduced the risk for relapses over 10 years, but it was not associated with improved disability outcomes compared to a control group that also initiated therapy relatively early in the disease (Kinkel et al 2012) . Over the 10- year study, the drop- out rate was significant. Similar results were observed with IFN -1b (BENEFIT study) over an 8- year observation period. Patients who received treatment early had a lower overall ARR compared to those patients who delayed treatment (Kappos et al2007, Edan et al 2014) . In the first 3 years of BENEFIT, early treatment with IFN -1b reduced the risk for progression of disability by 40% compared to delayed treatment (16% vs 25%, respectively; HR = 0.6; 95% CI : 0.39 to 0.92; p = 0.022). A 2018 systematic review and network meta- analysis of RCTs was conducted to assess the potential short - and long- term benefits of treatment with IFN - or glatiramer acetate in patients with CIS (Armoiry et al 2018) . The review identified 5 primary RCTs that assessed the time to clinically definite multiple sclerosis (CDMS) in patients with CIS treated with IFN - or glatiramer acetate vs placebo. They found that all drugs reduced the time to CDMS w hen c ompared with placebo, with a pooled HR of 0.51 (95% CI : 0.44 to 0.61) and low heterogeneity, and there was no ev idence that indicated that 1 active treatment was superior to another when compared indirectly. The authors noted t hat there was insufficient information to rate the risk of selection bias, 4 of the 5 studies were at high risk of performance bias, and 1 study was rated to have a high risk for attrition bias. Four of the trials had open- label extensi on s tudies performed over 5 to 10 years, all of which indicated that early DMT therapy (regardless of agent) led t o an i ncrease in time to CDMS when compared with placebo (HR = 0.64, 95% CI: 0.55 to 0.74; low heterogeneity). Thes e r esults should be taken with caution; however, as all of the open- label extension arms were at a high risk for attriti on bi as and had large losses to follow -up noted. The TOPIC study enrolled 618 patients with CIS and found teriflunomide 7 and 14 mg doses reduced the risk of relaps e def ining CDMS co mpared to placebo (Miller et al 2014) . Teriflunomide 14 mg reduced the risk of conversion to CDMS by 42.6% compared to placebo (HR, 0.574; 95% to .869; p = 0.0087) whereas teriflunomide 7 mg reduc ed t he conversion to CDMS by 37.2% compared to placebo (HR, p = 0.0271). Progre ssive MS Limited treatment options are available for patients with non- active SPMS and PPMS. Mitoxantrone is FDA -approved for treating SPMS, while ocrelizumab has been specifically approved for the treatment of PPMS (and relapsing forms of MS). Mitoxantrone was shown to reduce the clinical relapse rate and disease progression in aggressive RRMS, SPMS, and p rogressive- relapsing MS (Hartung et al 2002, Krapf et al 2005) . For MRI outcome measures, mitoxantrone was not statistically significantly different than placebo at month 12 or 24 for the total number of MRI scans with positive G dData as of April 11, 2019 PK-S /ALS/KR Page 80 This information is cons idered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

However, the baseline MRI lesion number and characteristics were different among the groups (Krapf et al 2005) . In 2010, Therapeutics and Technology Assessment Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology evaluated all published data including cohort data for mitoxantrone. Evaluation of efficacy found that mitoxantrone is probably effective in modestly reducing clinical attack rate, MRI activity, and disease progression. A confirmatory trial is necessary before widespread adoption of mitoxantrone for DMT for MS can be made in light of the risks of cardiotoxicity and treatment -related leukemia (Marriott et al 2010) . The results of studies with the other agents for MS have failed to consistently demonstrate a benefit in progressive forms of MS, and due to being off -label, these uses are not included in Table 2 . In the PROMISE trial, glatiramer acetate was no more effective than placebo in delaying the time to accumulated disability for patients with PP MS (Woli nsky et al 2007) . The ASCEND trial evaluated natalizumab in SPMS was found to have no significant difference in the rate of confirmed disability progression compared to placebo ( Kapoor et al 2018). Several IFN trials in this population have yielded conflicting results (Rizvi et al 2004) . A systematic analysis evaluated 5 c linical trials (N = 3082) of IFN compared to placebo in the treatment of SPMS. In 4 trials with the primary outcome of sustained disability progression at 3 or 6 months , IFN demonstrated no benefit. The risk ratio for sustained progressi on w ith IFN was 0.98 was high (I2 = 57%) (La M antia et al 2013) . Timing of DMT initiation A 2017 systematic review by Merkel et al (2017) evaluated the effect of high- efficacy immunotherapies (ie, fingolimod, natalizumab, alemtuzumab) at different stages of MS . Twelve publications (9 RCTs + 3 observational studies) wer e i dentified as reporting information relevant to the outcomes of early vs delayed initiation of high- efficacy DMTs for RRMS. A number of these studies suggested that earlier commencement of high- efficacy DMTs resulted in mor e e ffective control of relapse activity than their later initiation. The evidence regarding the effect of the timing of high- efficacy therapies on disability outcomes was conflicting ; additional data are required to answer this question. Decisions to discontinue DMTs in MS Patient with RRMS eventually progress to SP MS. Patients experience worsening disability with or without relapses. Current therapies focus on relapsing forms of MS and are not indicated for non- active SPMS. The decision t o di scontinue DMTs has not been well studied. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) publis hed a c omparative effectiveness review evaluating the decision dilemmas surrounding discontinuation of MS therapies in t he s etting of progressive disease and pregnancy (Butler et al 2015) . No studies directly assess continued therapy vs discontinued therapy for MS in comparable populations. Based on low strength of evidence, long- term all -cause survival is higher for treatment -na\u00efve MS patients who did not delay starting IFN -1b by 2 years and used DMT for a longer duration than those who delayed therapy. Very little evidence is available about the benefits and risks of discontinuati on of therapy for MS in women who desire pregnancy (Rae-Grant et al 2018[b] ). Meta -Analyses A 2017 systematic review conducted by the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) included ocrelizumab i n a c omparative efficacy analysis with other DMTs used in the treatment of MS. oNetwork meta- analyses demonstrated that for the treatment of RRMS, alemtuzumab, natalizumab, and ocrelizum ab ( in that order) were the most effective DMTs for reducing ARRs (~70% reduction vs placebo). oOcrelizumab and alemtuzumab had the greatest reductions in disability progression (53% to 58% reduction vs placebo, respectively), closely followed by natalizumab (44%). A systematic review that identified 28 RCTs found that the magnitude of ARR reduction varied between 15 to 36% for all IFN products, glatiramer acetate, and teriflunomide; for alemtuzumab, dimethyl fumarate, fingolimod, and natalizumab. The risk of 3- month disability progression was reduced by 19 to 28% with IFN products, glatiramer acetate, fingolimod, (Fogarty et al 2016) . RCTs (n = 39) evaluating 1 of 15 treatments for MS were analyzed for benefits and acceptability in 25,113 patients wit h RRM S (Tramacere et al 2015) . Drug s included daclizumab and laquinimod, were also included.

The network meta- analysis evaluated the recurrence of relapses and disability progression. oRelapses: alemtuzumab, mitoxantrone, natalizumab, and fingolimod were reported to have greater treatment benefit compared to placebo. Over 12 months (29 studies; N = 17,897): alemtuzumab: RR = 95% CI: 0.20 to 0.76; low quality evidence natalizumab: RR = 0.56, 95% CI: 0.43 to 0.73; high quality evidence fingolimod: RR = 0.63, 95% CI: 0.53 to 0.74; evidence = 0.78, 95% CI: 0.65 to 0.93; moderate quality evidence daclizumab (no longer on the market) : RR = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.61 to 0.68 to 0.93; moderate quality evidence oRelapses over 24 months vs placebo (26 studies; N = alemtuzumab: RR = CI: 0.27 to 0.81; = 0.56, 95% CI: 0.47 to CI: 0.64 to 0.81; moderate quality evidence oDisability worsening over 24 months vs placebo (26 studies; N = 16,800): mitoxantrone: RR = 0.20, 95% CI: 0.05 to 0.84; low quality evidence alemtuzumab: RR = 0.35, 95% CI: 0.26 to 0.48; 95% CI: 0.49 to 0.85; moderate quality evidence oRelapses and disability worsening over 36 months were only tested in 2 studies (CombiRx and CAMMS223). Bot h s tudies had a high risk of bias. oAcceptability: Higher rates of withdrawal due to adverse events compared to placebo over 12 months were report ed f or teriflunomide (RR = 2.24, 95% CI: fingolimod (RR = 8.26, 95% CI: 3.25 t o 20. 97). oOver 24 months, only fingolimod had a significantly higher proportion of participants who withdrew due to any adverse event (RR vs placebo = 1.69, 95% CI: 1.32 to 2.17). to 1.61 Filippini et al (2013) conducted a Cochrane review of 44 RCTs on the relative effectiveness and acceptability of DMTs and immunosuppressants in patients with either RRMS or progressive MS (N = 17,401). oOn the basis of high quality evidence, natalizumab and Rebif were superior to all other treatments for preventi ng c linical relapses in the short -term (24 months) in RRMS compared to placebo (OR = 0.32, 95% CI: 0.24 to 0.43; OR = 0.45, 95% CI: 0.28 to 0.71, respectively); they were also more effective than Avonex (OR = 0.28, 95% CI: 0.22 t o 0. 36; OR = 0.19, 95% CI: 0.06 to 0.6, respectively). oBased on moderate quality evidence, natalizumab and Rebif decreased the odds of patients with RRMS havi ng di sability progression in the short -term, with an absolute reduction of 14% and 10%, respectively, vs placebo. oNatalizumab and Betaseron were significantly more effective (OR = 0.62, CI: 0.49 to 0.78; OR = 0.35, 95% CI: 0.17 to 0.7, respectively) than Avonex in reducing the number of patients with RRMS who had progression at 2 years of follow -up, and confidence in this result was graded as moderate. oThe lack of convincing efficacy data showed that Avonex, IV immunoglobulins (IVIG), cyclophosphamide, and long- term corticosteroids have an unfavorable benefit -risk balance in RRMS. The Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH) conducted a systematic review of 30 RCTs t o as sess the comparative clinical - and cost -effectiveness of drug therapies for the treatment of RRMS (N ,= 16,998 ) (C ADTH, 2013). Results suggested that all active treatments produce statistically significant reductions in ARR compared with no treatment, and that there were clear between- treatment differences. oCompared with no treatment, reductions in the ARR were approximately 70% for natalizumab and alemtuzumab , of April 11, 2019 PK-S /ALS/KR Page 82 This information is cons idered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Clinic ians should refer to the full prescribing information and published resources when making medical decisions. oCompared with placebo, all active treatments exhibited a lower risk of sustained disability progression, but results were only statistically significant for Avonex, Rebif, natalizumab, fingolimod, teriflunomide, and dimethyl fumarate ; these agents ranged from 0.59 (95% CI: to treatment differences were less apparent. oAmong active comparisons, the risk of sustained disability progression was statistically lower for alemtuzumab (0.59, 95% CI: 0.40 to 0.80) compared with Avonex. oAmong active comparisons, MRI findings were more favorable for alemtuzumab compared with Rebif, and mor e f avorable for all 3 of fingolimod, Betaseron, and Rebif compared with Avonex. Compared with glatiramer acetate , T ecfidera resulted in a lower mean number of T2 lesions, but the mean number of Gd- enhancing lesions was not statistically different between these 2 treatments. oThe incidence of serious adv erse events and treatment discontinuations did not differ significantly betw een t reatments in the majority of trials, except for a higher incidence of treatment discontinuation for Rebif compared t o pl acebo and alemtuzumab. Hamidi et al (2018) conducted a systematic review and network meta- analysis of 37 studies including 26 RCTs from a health technology assessment (HTA) report and 11 supplemental RCTs published after the HTA . emtuzumab were included and were compared to either placebo or any drug treatment in patients of varying treatment experience levels . Key findings from the network meta -analysis include: oAlemtuzumab 12 mg had the highest probability of preventing annual relapses (RR = 0.29, 95% CI: 0.23 to 0.35; hig mg (RR = 0.36, 95% CI: 0.16 to 0.7; low quality evidence) ( RR = 0.40, 95% CI: 0.27 to 0.60; very low quality evidence) were the most effective against progression of disability . oDimethyl fumarate 240 mg and fingolimod 0.5 mg and 1. 25 mg were more effective treatments when consideri ng annual relapse and disability progression: Annual relapse: 0.42 to 0.6; = 0.45, 95% CI: high evidence Disability progression: mg daily: RR = 0.49 to 0.85; = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.56 to 0.90; high quality evidence oWithdrawal due to adverse events was difficult to assess due to the low quality of available evidence, however, t he aut hors determined that: Fingolimod 1.25 mg ( RR = 2.21, CI: to 2.5; moderate mcg (RR = 2.21, 95% CI: 1.29 to 3.97; low quality evidence) were associated with higher withdrawals due to adverse events w hen c ompared with other treatment options. oAlemtuzumab 24 mg (mean difference = - 0.91; 95% CI: - 1.48 to - 0.40), and 12 mg (mean difference = - 0.6; 95% CI: -1.02 to - 0.24) were more effective than other therapies in lowering the EDSS . oNo treatments were found to significantly increase serious adverse events; peginterferon -1a was associated wit h m ore adverse events overall when compared with other medications (RR = 1.66, 95% CI: 1.21 to 2.28). oNone of the 11 agents studied were associated with a statistically significantly higher risk of mortality when compare d t o placebo. A Bayesian network meta- analysis evaluating DMTs for RRMS ranked the most effective therapies based on SUCRA analysis ( Lucchetta et al 2018). A total of 33 studies were included in the analysis. For the ARR, alemtuzumab (96% probability), natalizumab (96%), and ocrelizumab (85%) were determined to be the most effective therapies ( high- quality evidence). A meta- analysis of randomized controlled trials was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of teriflunomide i n reducing the frequency of relapses and progression of physical disability in patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis (Xu et al 2016) . The results showed that teriflunomide (7 and 14 mg) reduced the ARR and teriflunomide 14 mg decrease d the disability progression in comparison to placebo (RR = 0.69, 95% CI: 0.55 to 0.87) .Data as of April 11, 2019 PK-S /ALS/KR Page 83 This information is cons idered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

CLINICAL GUIDELINES The European Committee for Research and Treatment of Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS) and the European Academy of Neurology (EAN) published updated guidelines in 2018 ( Montalban et al 2018). The main recommendations reported were the following: oThe entire spectrum of disease- modify ing drugs should be prescribed only in centers with adequate infrastructure t o pr ovide proper monitoring of patients, comprehensive assessment, detection of side effects, and capacity to address them properly. (Consensus statement) oOffer IFN or glatiramer acetate to patients with CIS and abnormal MRI findings with lesions suggesting MS w ho do not fulfill full criteria for MS. (Strong) oOffer early treatment with disease- modifying drugs in patients with active RRMS, as defined by clinical relapses and/or MRI activity (active lesions: contrast -enhancing lesions; new or unequivocally enlarging T2 lesions assess ed at least annually). (Strong) oFor active RRMS, choosing among the wide range of available drugs from the modestly effective to the highly effective will depend on patient characteristics and comorbidity, disease severity /activity , drug safety profile, and ac cessibility of the drug. (Consensus statement) oConsider treatment with IFN in patients with active SPMS, taking into account, in discussion with the patient, t he dubi ous efficacy, as well as safety and tolerability profile. (Weak) oConsider treatment with mitoxantrone in patients with active SPMS, taking into account the efficacy and specifically the safety and tolerability profile of this agent. (Weak) oConsider ocrelizumab for patients with active SPMS. (Weak) patients with PP MS. ( Weak ) oAlways consult the summary of product characteristics for dosage, special warnings, and precautions of use, contraindications, and monitoring of side effects and potential harms. (Consensus statement) oConsider combining MRI with clinical measures when evaluating disease evolution in treated patients. (Weak) oWhen monitoring treatment response in patients treated with disease- modifying drugs, perform standardiz ed r eference brain MRI within 6 months of treatment onset and compare the results with those of further brain MRI, typically performed 12 months after starting treatment. Adjust the timing of both MRIs, taking into account the drug's mechanism and speed of action and disease activity, including clinical and MRI measures. (Consensus statement) oWhen monitoring treatment response in patients treated with disease- modifying drugs, the measurement of new or unequivocally enlarging T2 lesions is the preferred MRI method, supplemented by Gd -enhancing lesions for monitoring treatment response. Evaluation of these parameters requires high- quality standardized MRI scans and i nterpretation by highly qualified readers with experience in MS. (Consensus statement) oWhen monitoring treatment safety in patients treated with disease- modifying drugs, perform standard reference MRI every year in patients at low risk for PML, and more frequently (3 to 6 months) in patients at high risk for PML (JCvirus positivity, natalizumab treatment duration over 18 months) and in patients at high risk for PML who switch drugsat the time the current treatment is discontinued and the new treatment is started. (Consensus statement) oOffer a more efficacious drug to patients treated wit h IFN or glatiramer acetate who show evidence of diseas e ac tivity, assessed as recommended above. (Strong) oW hen deciding on which drug to switch to, in consultation with the patient, consider patient characteristics and c omorbidities, drug safety profile, and disease severity/activity. (Consensus statement) oWhen treatment with a highly efficacious drug is stopped, whether due to inefficacy or safety, consider starti ng anot her highly efficacious drug. When starting the new drug, take into account disease activity (clinical and MRI; t he gr eater the disease activity, the greater the urgency to start new treatment), the half -life and biological activity of t he pr evious drug, and the potential for resumed disease activity or even rebound (particularly with nat alizumab). (Consensus statement) oIn treatment decisions, consider the possibility of resumed disease activity or even rebound when stopping treatment,particularly with natalizumab. (Weak) oConsider continuing a disease -modifying drug if the patient is stable (clinically and on MRI) and shows no safety or tolerability issues. (Weak) oAdvise all women of childbearing potential that disease- modifying drugs are not licensed during pregnancy, except glatiramer acetate 20 mg/mL .

Patients should always seek the advice of a physician or other qualified health pr ovider with any ques tions regarding a medic al condition. Clinic ians should refer to the full prescribing information and published resources when making medical decisions. oFor women planning a pregnancy, if there is a high risk for disease reactivation, consider using IFN or glatiramer acetate until pregnancy is confirmed. In some very specific (active) cases, continuing this treatment during pregnancy could also be considered. (Weak) oFor women with persistent high disease activity, it would generally be advised to delay pregnancy. For those who still decide to become pregnant or have an unplanned pregnancy, treatment with natalizumab throughout pregnancy may be considered after full discussion of potential implications; or treatment with alemtuzumab could be an alternative for planned pregnancy in very active cases provided that a 4- month interval is strictly observed from the latest infusi on unt il conception. (Weak) The American Academy of Neurology (AAN ) performed a systematic review that included 20 Cochrane reviews and 73 addi tional articles in order to assess the available evidence on initiation, switching, and stopping DMTs in patients wit h MS (R ae Grant et al 2018[a]) . The results of the systematic review were used to assist in formulating updated AAN treatment guidelines (Rae Grant et al 2018[b]) . The main recommendations were as follows: oStarting DMT Clinicians should discuss the benets and risks of DMTs for people with a single clinical demyelinating event wit h 2 o r more brain lesions that have imaging characteristics consistent with MS (Level B). After discussing the risks and bene ts, clinicians should prescribe DMT s to people with a single clinical demyelinating event and 2 or more brai n l esions characteristic of MS who decide they want this therapy. (Level B) Clinicians should offer DMTs to people with relapsing forms of MS with recent clinical relapses or MRI activity . ( Level B) Clinicians should monitor the reproductive plans of women with MS and counsel regarding reproductive risks and us e of birth control during DMT use in women of childbearing potential who have MS. (Level B) Clinicians should counsel men with MS on their reproductive plans regarding treatment implications before initiatin g t reatment with teriflunomide. (Level B) Because of the high frequency of severe adverse events, clinicians should not prescribe mitoxantrone to peopl e w ith MS unless the potential therapeutic benets greatly outweigh the risks . (Level B) Clinicians should prescribe alemtuzumab, ngolimod, or natalizumab for people with highly active MS . (Level B) Clinicians may initiate natalizumab treatment in people with MS with positive anti -JCV antibody indices above 0. 9 onl y when there is a reasonable chance of benet compared with the low but serious risk of PML. (Level C) Clinicians should off er ocrelizumab to people with PPMS who are likely to benet from this therapy unless there ar e r isks of treatment that outweigh the benets. (Level B) oSwitching DMT s Clinicians should discuss switching from one DMT to another in people with MS who have been using a DMT l ong enough for the treatment to take full effect and are adherent to their therapy when they experience 1 or mor e r elapses, 2 or more unequivocally new MRI -detected lesions, or increased disability on examination, over a 1- year period of using a DMT. (Level B) Clinicians should evaluate the degree of disease activity, adherence, adverse event proles, and mechanism of action of DMTs when switching DMTs in people with MS with breakthrough disease activity during DMT use. (Level B) Clinicians should discuss a change to non- injectable or less frequently injected DMTs in people with MS who report intolerable discomfort with the injections or in those who report injection fatigue on injectable DMTs. (Level B) Clinicians sh ould inquire about medication adverse events with people with MS who are taking a DMT and attempt to manage these adverse events, as appropriate (Level B). Clinicians should discuss a medication switch wit h peopl e with MS for whom these adverse events negatively influence adherence. (Level B) Clinicians should monitor laboratory abnormalities found on requisite laboratory surveillance (as outlined in t he m edication's package insert) in people with MS who are using a DMT (Level B). Clinicians should discuss switchin g DM Ts or reducing dosage or frequency (where there are data on different doses [eg, interferons, teriflunomide]) when there are persistent laboratory abnormalities . (Level B) Clinicians should counsel people with MS considering natalizumab, ngolimod, ocrelizumab, and dimethyl fumarat e about the PML risk associated with these agents (Level B). Clinicians should discuss switching to a DMT wit h a l ower PML risk with people with MS taking natalizumab who are or who become JCV antibody -positive, especially with an index of above 0.9 while on therapy . (Level B) Clinicians should counsel that new DMTs without long- term safety data have an undened risk of malignancy and i nfection for people with MS starting or using new DMTs (Level B). If a patient with MS develops a malignancy while using a DMT, clinicians should promptly discuss switching to an alternate DMT, especially for people with MSData as of April 11, 2019 PK-S /ALS/KR Page 85 This information is cons idered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Clinic ians should refer to the full prescribing information and published resources when making medical decisions. using ngolimod, teriflunomide, alemtuzumab, or dimethyl fumarate (Level B). People with MS with serious infections potentially linked to their DMT s should switch DMTs (does not pertain to PML management in people with MS using DMT). (Level B) Clinicians should check for natalizumab antibodies in people with MS who have infusion reactions befor e s ubsequent infusions, or in people with MS who experience breakthrough disease activity with natalizumab us e ( Level B). Clinicians should switch DMTs in people with MS who have persistent natalizumab antibodies. (Level B) Physicians must counsel people with MS considering natalizumab discontinuation that there is an increased risk of MS relapse or MRI -detected disease activity within 6 months of discontinuation (Level A). Physicians and peopl e w ith MS choosing to switch from natalizumab to ngolimod should initiate treatment within 8 to 12 weeks after natalizumab discontinuation (for reasons other than pregnancy or pregnancy planning) to diminish the return of disease activity. (Level B) Clinicians should counsel women to stop their DMT before conception for planned pregnancies unless the risk of MS activity during pregnancy outweighs the risk associated with the specic DMT during pregnancy (Level B). Clinicians should discontinue DMTs during pregnancy if accidental exposure occurs, unless the risk of MS activity during pregnancy outweighs the risk associated with the specic DMT during pregnancy (Level B). Cliniciansshould not initiate DMTs during pregnancy unless the risk of MS activity during pregnancy outweighs the risk associated with the specic DMT during pregnancy . (Level B) oStopping DMT s In people with RRMS who are stable on DMT and want to discontinue therapy, clinicians should counsel peopl e r egarding the need for ongoing follow -up and periodic reevaluation of the decision to discontinue DMT (Level B). Clinicians should advocate that people with MS who are stable (that is , those with no relapses, no disability progression, and stable imaging) on DMT should continue their current DMT unless the patient and physicia n dec ide a trial off therapy is warranted. (Level B) Clinicians should assess the likelihood of future relapse in individuals with SPMS by assessing patient age, diseas e dur ation, relapse history, and MRI -detected activity (eg, frequency, severity, time since most recent relapse or gadolinium -enhanced lesion) (Level B). Clinicians may advise discontinuation of DMT in people with SPMS w ho do not have ongoing relapses (or gadolinium enhanced lesions on MRI activity) and have not been ambulatory (EDSS 7 or greater) for at least 2 years . (Level C) Clinicians should review the associated risks of continuing DMTs vs those of stopping DMTs in people with CIS using DMTs who have not been diagnosed with MS. (Level B) According to the 2013 Canadian recommendations for treatment of MS, treatment decisions should be based on t he l evel of concern for the rate and severity of relapses, degree of functional impairment due to relapses and disability progression. First -line treatment recommendations for RRMS include IFN products and glatiramer acetate. Second- line therapies for RRMS include fingolimod and natalizumab (Freedman et al 2013) . With an increasing number of options for the treatment of RRMS, the place in therapy for an individual agent is not straightforward. Treatment decisions will likely be based on a consideration of the risks and benefits of each therapy, physician experience, patient comorbidities, and patient preferences. The 2015 AAN position statement supports access to all DMT for patients with MS. In addition, step therapy should be driven by evidence- based clinical and safety information and not just based on costs. Highly individualized treatment decisions are necessary for patients with MSaccording to the AAN (Corboy et al 2015) . The 2015 Association of British Neurologists state that all available DMT s are effective in reducing relapse rate and MRI lesion accumulation (Scolding et al 2015) . Evidence is less clear on the impact of DMT on long- term disability. Drugs ar e s eparated into 2 categories based on relative efficacy. Category 1 - moderate efficacy includes IFN s (including pegIFN ), glatiramer acetate, teriflunomide, dimethyl fingolimod. Category - high efficacy includes alemtuzuma b and nat alizumab - these drugs should be reserved for patients with very active MS. In September 2018, the MS Coalition published an update to its consensus paper on the principles and current evidenc e c oncerning the use of DMTs in MS. Major recommendations included the following: oInitiation of treatment with an FDA -approved DMT is recommended a s soon as possible following a diagnosis of relapsing or primary progressive MS, regardless of the person's age; for individuals with a first clinical event and MRI features consistent with MS in whom other possible causes have been excluded; and for individuals with progressiv e M S who continue to demonstrate clinical relapses and/or demonstrate inflammatory activity. oClinicians should consider prescribing a high efficacy medication such as alemtuzumab, fingolimod, ocrelizumab ornatalizumab for newly -diagnosed individuals with highly active MS.Data as of April 11, 2019 PK-S /ALS/KR Page 86 This information is cons idered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Potential contraindications limit options for some individuals. Risk tolerance varies among people with MS and their treating clinicians. Route of delivery, frequency of dosing, and side effects may affect adherence and quality of life. Individual differences related to tolerability and adherence may necessitate access to different medications withi n t he same class. Pregnancy and breastfeeding limit the available options . oIndividuals' access to treatment should not be limited by their frequency of relapses, level of disability, or personal characteristics such as age, sex, or ethnicity. oAbsence of relapses while on treatment is a characteristic of treatment effectiveness and should not be considered a justification for discontinuation of treatment. SAFETY SUMMARY Warnings for IFN include decreased peripheral blood cell counts including leukopenia, higher rates of depression, suicide and psychotic disorders, injection site reactions, and risk of severe hepatic injury. IFN is associated with i nfluenza -like symptoms including injection site reactions, musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, and headache. All IFN products carry a warning for thrombotic thrombocytopeni c syndrome. Adverse events related to IFN therapy appear to be dose- related and transient. Glatiramer acetate is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to glatiramer acetate or mannitol. Patients treated with glatiramer acetate may experience a transient, self -limited, post-injection reaction of flushing, chest pain, palpitations, tachycardia, anxiety, dyspnea, constriction of the throat , and urticaria immediately following injection . I njection site reactions including lipodystrophy and skin necrosis have been reported. Because glatiramer acetate can m odify immune response, it may interfere with immune functions. In controlled studies of glatiramer acetate 20 mg/mL, the most common adverse reactions ( 10% and 1.5 times higher than placebo) were injection site reactions, vasodilatation, rash, dyspnea, and chest pain. In a controlled study of glatiramer acetate 40 mg/mL, the most comm on adv erse reactions ( 10% and 1.5 times higher than placebo) were injection site reactions. Fingolimod was originally approved with a risk evaluation and mitigation strategies program (REMS) to inform healthcar e pr oviders about the serious risks including bradyarrhythmia, atrioventricular block, infections, macular edema, respiratory effects, hepatic effects, fetal risk, increased blood pressure, basal cell carcinoma, immune system effects following discontinuation, and hypersensitivity reactions; however, the FDA lifted the REMS requirements in November 2016. Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) has been reported with fingolimod. Patients with pre- existing cardiac disease may poorly tolerate fingolimod and may require additional monitoring. In clinical trials, the most common adverse reactions (incidence 10% and > placebo) were headache, liver transaminase elevation, diarrhea, cough, influenza, sinusitis, back pain, abdominal pain, and pain in extremity. If a serious infection develops, considersuspending fingolimod and reassess risks and benefits prior to re- initiation. Elimination may take up to 2 months thus, monitoring for infections should continue during this time. Do not start fingolimod in patients with active acute or chronic infection until the infection is resolved. Life -threatening and fatal infections have been reported in patients taki ng f ingolimod. Establish immunity to varicella zoster virus prior to therapy initiation. Recent safety labeling changes warn of an increased risk of cutaneous malignancies, including melanoma, in patients treated with fingolimod.

A warning for PML has been added to the fingolimod labeling; at the first sign or symptom suggestive of PML, fingolimod should be withheld and an appropriate diagnostic evaluation performed. Monitoring for signs consistent with PML on MRI may be useful to allow for an early diagnos is. Additionally, severe increases in disability after discontinuation of fingolimod have been described in post marketing reports. Teriflunomide is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment; patients who are pregnant, of childbeari ng pot ential , or that are not using reliable contraception; and with concurrent use of leflunomide. Labeling includes box ed w arnings regarding hepatotoxicity and teratogenicity/embryolethality that occurred in animal reproduction studies i n m ultiple animal species at plasma teriflunomide exposures similar to or lower than in humans. Other warnings incl ude r isk of leukopenia, peripheral neuropathy, severe skin reactions, and elevated blood pressure. Teriflunomide has a half - life of 4 to 5 months; therefore, use of activated charcoal or cholestyramine in an 11- day regimen upon discontinuation of teriflunomide is recommended to reduce serum levels over 2 weeks. The most common adverse reactions ( 10% and 2% greater than placebo) are headache, diarrhea, nausea, alopecia, and an increase in alanine aminotransferas e (A LT). Dimethyl fumarate has no contraindications, except in patients with hypersensitivity to dimethyl fumarate excipients. Warnings include anaphylaxis and angioedema, PML, lymphopenia, and clinically significant cases of liver injury reported in the post -marketing setting. Consider therapy interruption if severe lymphopenia for more than 6 m onths occurs. Cases of PML have been reported following dimethyl fumarate therapy. Monitoring for signs consistent with PML on MRI may be useful to allow for an early diagnosis. Common adverse events (incidence 10% and 2% more than placebo) were flushing, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and nausea. Administration of non- enteric aspirin up t o 325 m g given 30 minutes prior to each dose or temporary dose reduction to 120 mg twice daily may reduce flushing. Natalizumab has a boxed warning regarding the risk of PML. PML is an opportunistic viral infection of the brain that usually leads to death or severe disability. Due to the risk of PML, natalizumab is only available through the TOUCH\u00ae P rescribing Program which is a restricted distribution program. Natalizumab is contraindicated in patients who have or have had PML and in patients who have had a hypersensitivit y reaction. The most common adverse reactions (incidence 10%) were headache, fatigue, arthralgia, urinary tract infection, lower respiratory tract infection, gastroenteritis, vaginitis, depression, pain in extremity, abdominal discomfort hypersensitivity reaction to natalizumab. Monitoring for signs consistent with PML on MRI may be useful to allow for an early diagnosis. Other warnings wit h nat alizumab include hypersensitivity reactions, increased risk of Herpes encephalitis and meningitis, acute retinal necrosis, increased risk of infections (including opportunistic infections), and hepatotoxicity, diarrhea (not otherwis e s pecified), and rash. Mitoxantrone has boxed warnings for the risk of cardiotoxicity, risk of bone marrow suppression, and secondary leukemia. Congestive heart failure (CHF), potentially fatal, may occur either during therapy with mitoxantrone or months to years after termination of therapy. The maximum cumulative lifetime dose of mitoxantrone for MS patients should not exceed 140 mg/kg/m2. Monitoring of cardiac function is required prior to all mitoxantrone doses. Alemtuzumab is contraindicated in patients with h uman immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The boxed warning for alemtuzumab includes autoimmunity conditions (immune thrombocytopenia and anti -glomerular basement membr ane disease), serious and life- threatening infusion reactions, serious and life- threatening stroke within 3 days of administration, and the possibility of an increased risk of malignancies. Alemtuzumab is only available thr ough a r estricted distribution and REMS program which requires the member, provider, pharmacy and infusion facility t o be c ertified by the REMS program. Approximately one- third of patients who receive alemtuzumab develop thyroi d di sorders. The most commonly reported adverse events reported in at least 10% of alemtuzumab- treated patients and m ore frequently than with IFN -1a were rash, headache, pyrexia, nasopharyngitis, nausea, urinary tract infection, fatigue, insomnia, upper respiratory tract infection, herpes viral infection, urticaria, pruritus, thyroid disorders, fungalinfection, arthralgia, diarrhea, sinusitis, oropharyngeal pain, paresthesia, dizziness,abdominal pain, flushing, and vomiting. Nearly all patients (99.9%) in clinical trials had lymphopenia followi ng a t reatment course of alemtuzumab. Alemtuzumab may also increase the risk of acute acalculous cholecystitis; i n c ontrolled clinical studies, 0.2% of alemtuzumab- treated MS patients developed acute acalculous cholecystitis, compared to 0% of patients treated with IFN -1a. During postmarketing use, additional cases of acute acalculous cholecystitis have been reported in alemtuzumab- treated patients. Recent updates to the safety labeling include a w arning that patients taking alemtuzumab are at risk for serious infections caused by Listeria monocytogenes . Patients that are prescribed alemtuzumab should be counseled about this risk, and to avoid or appropriately heat any foods that may be a source of Listeria, such as deli meat s and unpasteurized cheeses. Patients should undergo tuberculosis screening according to local guidelines. Data as of April 11, 2019 PK-S /ALS/KR Page 88 This information is cons idered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

The labeling of o crelizumab does not contain any boxed warnings; however, ocrelizumab is contraindicated in patients with active hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and in those with a history of life- threatening infusion reactions t o oc relizumab. Additional warnings for ocrelizumab concern infusion reactions, infections, and an increased risk of malignancies. oAs of June 30, 2016, the overall incidence rate of first neoplasm among ocrelizumab- treated patients across all 3 pi votal studies and a Phase 2, dose- finding study (Kappos et al [2011]) was 0.40 per 100 patient -years of exposur e t o ocrelizumab (6467 patient -years of exposure) vs 0.20 per 100 patient -years of exposure in the pooled comparator groups (2053 patient -years of exposure in groups receiving Rebif or placebo) (Hauser et al 2017, Ocrevus Formulary Submission Dossier 2017) . S ince breast cancer occurred in 6 out of 781 females treated with ocrelizumab (vs in none of 668 females treat ed w ith Rebif or placebo), the labeling of ocrelizumab additionally recommends that patients follow standard breast cancer screening guidelines. In related postmarketing requirements, the FDA has asked the manufacturer to conduct a prospective, longitudinal, observational study in adult patients with RMS and PPMS exposed to ocrelizumab to determine the incidence and m ortality rates of breast cancer and all malignancies. All patients enrolled in the study need to be followed for a m inimum of 5 years or until death following their first exposure to ocrelizumab and the protocol must specify 2 appr opriate populations to which the observed incidence and mortality rates will be c ompared (FDA approval letter 2017) . oNo cases of PML have been reported to date in any studies of ocrelizumab ( Hauser et al 2017, McGinley et al et al 2017, Ocrevus Formulary Submission Dossier 2017). oIn patients with RMS, the most common adverse reactions with ocrelizumab (incidence 10% and greater t han R ebif) were upper respiratory tract infections and infusion reactions. In patients with PPMS, the most comm on adv erse reactions (incidence 10% and greater than placebo) were upper respiratory tract infections, infusi on r eactions, skin infections, and lower respiratory tract infections. Dalfampridine is contraindicated in patients with a history of seizure, moderate or severe renal impairment (CrCl 50 m L/min), and a history of hypersensit ivity to dalfampridine or 4-aminopyridine. Dalfampridine can cause anaphylaxis; signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis have included respiratory compromise, urticaria, and angioedema of the throat and or tongue. Urinary tract infections (UTIs) were reported more frequently as adverse reactions in controlled studies i n pat ients receiving dalfampridine 10 mg twice daily (12%) as compared to placebo (8%). The most common advers e ev ents (incidence 2% and at a rate greater than the placebo rate) for dalfampridine w ere UTI, insomnia, dizziness, headache, nausea, asthenia, back pain, balance disorder, MS relapse, paresthesia, nasopharyngitis, constipation, dyspepsia, and pharyngolaryngeal with a cytochrome P4502C9*3/*3 genotype, presence of Mobitz type II second- degree, third degree atrioventricular (AV) block or sinus syndrome. It is also contraindicated in patients that hav e experienced myocardial infarction, unstable angina, stroke, transient ischemic attack or decompensated heart failur e requiring hospitalization in the past 6 months. Warnings and precautions of s iponimod include macular edema, increased blood pressure, bradyarrhythmia and AV conduction delays, decline in pulmonary function, and liver injury. Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during and for 10 days after stopping siponimod due to fetal risk . The most adverse events are headache, hypertension, and transaminase increases. Cladribine is contraindicated in patients with current malignancy, HIV infection, active chronic infection such as hepatitis or tuberculosis, hypersensitivity to cladribine, and in pregnant women. There is a boxed warning for potential malignancy and risk of teratogenicity. The warnings and precautions are lymphopenia, active infection, hematologic toxicity, liver injury, and graft vs host disease with blood transfusion. The most common adverse events are upper respiratory tract infection, headache, and lymphopenia. Table 3.

CONCLUSION DMTs for MS have shown benefits in patients with RRMS such as a decreased relapse rate and a slower accumulati on of brain lesions on MRI. Therefore, it is recommended that all patients with a diagnosis of definite RRMS begin DMTs (MS Coalition 2017) . IFN products have been shown to decrease MRI lesion activity, prevent relapses, and delay disease progression. In general, patients treated with IFN or glatiramer acetate can expect a 30% reduction in ARR during a 2-year period (MS Coalition 2017) . Head- to-head clinical trials have found IFN and glatiramer acetate to be comparable in terms of efficacy on relapse rate. Several studies have demonstrated an improved tolerability at the cost of a decreas ed t herapeutic response with the low dose IM IFN -1a compared t o the higher dose SC IFN -1a (Panitch et al 2002, Panitch et al 2005, Schwid et al 2005, Schwid et al 2007, Traboulsee et al 2008) . Influenza- type symptoms, injection sit e r eactions, headache, nausea, and musculoskeletal pain are the most frequently report ed adverse events with IFN products including Plegridy . With IFN, use caution in patients with depression or other mood disorders. Peginterfer on -1a ev ery 2 weeks has demonstrated efficacy in reducing the ARR in relapsing forms of MS compared to placebo . P otential advantages of Plegridy are less frequent administration every 2 weeks and possibly the reduced risk of NAb development. Adverse effect profile is similar among the IFN s. The most frequently reported adverse events with glatiramer acetate include a transient, self -limiting, post -injecti on s ystemic reaction immediately following drug administration consisting of flushing, chest pain, palpitations, anxiety, dyspnea, throat constriction, and urticaria. Glatiramer acetate does not have any known drug interactions and is not associated with an increased risk of hepatotoxicity or depression. G latiramer acetate is generically available. Despite advancements in treatment, many patients fail initial DMTs with glatiramer acetate or IFN, primarily due t o i ntolerable adverse effects or perceived inadequate efficacy (Coyle 2008, Portaccio et al 2008) . Clinical trials hav e s hown that patients switching from IFN to glatiramer acetate therapy and vice versa, due to poor response, may achieve a significant reduction in relapse rates and a delay in disease and disability progression (Coyle 2008, Caon et al2006, Zwibel 2006) . The guidelines suggest that all first -line MS DMTs should be made accessible, and the choice of initial treatment should be based on patient -specific factors (Corboy et al 2015, MS Coalition 2017, Scolding et al 2015 , M ontalban et al 2018) . Premature discontinuation rate is high among patients with MS; therefore, factors that will maximize adherence should be considered when initiating therapy. Failure with 1 agent does not necessarily predict failure to another. Therefore, patients experiencing an inadequate response or drug- induced adverse event shoul d be s witched to a different DMT (Coyle 2008, Portaccio et al 2008) . There are now 5 available oral agents: Gilenya (fingolimod), which was approved in 2010, Aubagio (teriflunomide), h w as approved 2012, and Tecfidera (dimethyl fumarate), which was approved in 2013. The 2 new agents are Mavencl ad ( cladribine) and Mayzent (siponimod). Among other potential benefits, it is expected that the availability of oral agents may increase convenience and improve patient adherence to their drug regimen (S anvito et al 2011) . The available oral drugs each have different mechanisms of action and tolerability profiles. The oral products have not been compared t oData as of April 11, 2019 PK-S /ALS/KR Page 97 This information is cons idered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Clinic ians should refer to the full prescribing information and published resources when making medical decisions. one another in any head- to-head trials. Cases of PML have been reported in patients taking fingolimod and dimethyl fumarate. Mayzent (siponimod) is a sphingosine 1- phosphate receptor modulator, similar to fingolimod, indicated for t he treatment of relapsing forms of MS, to include CIS, relapsing- remitting disease, and active secondary progressiv e disease. In a trial comparing Mayzent to placebo, Mayzent significantly reduced the risk of 3- month CDP, delayed t he risk of 6 -month CDP, and reduced the ARR ( Kappos et al 2018). First dose cardiac monitoring is recommended for patients with a heart rate < 55 bpm or a history of cardiac disease. Siponimod shares many of the same warnings as fingolimod. Mavenclad (cladribine) is a purine antimetabolite indicated for the treatment of relapsing forms of MS , to incl ude relapsing- remitting disease and active secondary progressive disease. In a trial comparing Mavenclad to placebo, bot h Mavenclad 3.5 mg/kg and 5.25 mg/kg treatment groups had reduced ARRs and disability progression vs plac ebo (Giovannoni et al 2010 ). Lymphopenia is the most common adverse effect. Gilenya (fingolimod) is a sphingosine 1- phosphate receptor modulator. In a trial comparing fingolimod to placebo, fingolimod- treated patients had a decreased ARR, improved MRI outcomes, and a lower likelihood of disability progression (Kappos et al 2010) . In a trial IFN -1a IM ( Avonex ), fingolimod- treated patients had a decreased ARR and improved MRI outcomes, but disability progression was similar in the 2 groups (Cohen et al, 2010) . The adverse event profile for fingolimod includes cardiovascular risks including bradycardia. First dos e adm inistration of fingolimod requires at least 6 hours of observation with hourly monitoring of heart rate and bl ood pr essure, and patients should have an E CG before dosing and at the end of the observation period. Fingolimod is also FDA -approved for MS in the pediatric population. In a trial evaluating patients betw een 10 and 17 y ears of age, fingolimod significantly reduced ARR and the rate or new or newly enlarged lesions compared to IFN - 1a (Chitnis et al 2018). Tecfidera (dimethyl fumarate) has efficacy similar to that of fingolimod; its benefit -risk profile makes it a reasonabl e i nitial or later stage DMT option for most patients with RRMS (CADTH 2013 , Wingerchuk et al 2014) . Gastrointestinal intolerance and flushing are common side effects that may wane with time; slow ti tration to maintenance doses, taki ng t he medication with food, and premedication with aspirin may reduce their severity . Aubagio (teriflunomide) inhibits dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, a de novo pyrimidi ne s ynthesis. Although its exact mechanism of action is unknown, it may involve a reduction in the number of activat ed l ymphocytes in the CNS. Patients treated with teriflunomide in a clinical trial experienced a reduction in the ARR and i mproved MRI outcomes compared to placebo. Patients in the higher dose group (14 mg) also had a lower likelihood of disability progression, but this difference was not statistically significant in the lower dose group (7 mg) (O'Connor et al , 2011) . T eriflunomide has boxed warnings for the possibility of severe liver injury and teratogenicity. The most comm on adv erse reactions include increases in ALT, alopecia, diarrhea, influenza, nausea, and paresthesia. Tysabri (natalizumab) has demonstrated very high efficacy vs placebo and although PML is a major safety concern, t he ov erall incidence of PML has remained low (0.4%). Natalizumab can only be obtained through a restricted distributi on pr ogram. Lemtrada (alemtuzumab) is a highly efficacious DMT that has demonstrated superiority in reducing relapses w hen c ompared to Rebif in both treatment -na\u00efve and treatment -experienced patients. The d osing schedule of 2 annual treatment courses is counterbalanced by the need for regular monitoring of the increased risk for autoimmunity. Lemtrada is best reserved for patients who have failed at least 2 other DMTs and are not candidates for natalizum ab (G arnock -Jones 2014). Ocrevus (ocrelizumab) is a recombinant monoclonal antibody designed to selectively target CD20 -positive B cells. As a hum anized form of Rituxan (rituximab), ocrelizumab is expected to be less immunogenic with repeated infusions and m ay have a more favorable benefit -to-risk profile than Rituxan (Sorensen et al 2016) . oThe approval of Ocrevus provides another DMT option to the growing armamentarium of highly effective agentsindicated for the treatment of RMS. Ocrelizumab is also indicated for the treatment of PPMS, making it the first DMT with substantial evidence supporting its use in this form of MS. Although the pivotal studies of ocrelizumab were of sufficient length to assess efficacy, more long- term safety data are needed to evaluate the effects of ocrelizum ab on em ergent neoplasms and the risk of PML. Mitoxantrone is a synthetic intercalating chemotherapeutic agent. While it is approved for the treatment of RRMS, SPMS, and PRMS, cumulative dose- related cardiac toxicity and the risk for secondary leukemia markedly limit its use. Mitoxantrone is, therefore, reserved for use in patients with aggressive disease. While DMTs do not sufficiently address QOL in RRMS, symptomatic agents such as Ampyra (dalfampridine) c an be us ed to complement treatment with DMTs . Although a 25% improvement in T25FW may appear marginal, it has beenData as of April 11, 2019 PK-S /ALS/KR Page 98 This information is cons idered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Dalfampridine can complement DMTs, which do not address the specific symptom of walking speed. Improved walking could potentially contain some of the direct and indirect costs (eg, reduced productivity, disability, unemployment, costs of assistive devices and caregivers) associated with MS. With an increasing number of DMTs currently on the market and no specific MS algorithm in place to guide treatment decisions , the selection of an agent is generally based on considerations of the risks and benefits of each therapy, physician experience, patient comorbidities, and patient preferences.
