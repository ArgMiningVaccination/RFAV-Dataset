It is based on the principle called \"the Law of Similars\". The principle states that \"like cures like\", or that a substance can treat a sick person's symptoms if it can cause a similar sickness in a healthy person. Under homeopathic theories, homeopathic medicines seek to stimulate the body's inherent healing response, working to return it to a state of health. According to the National Center for Homeopathy, among other differences, homeopathic medicines seek to stimulate a healing response, while most conventional allopathic cold medicines seek to control symptoms. Both homeopathic and allopathic medicines are regulated by the FDA. Homeopathy has been practiced for more than 200 years.
