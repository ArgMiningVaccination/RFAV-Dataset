About Our Products Alliance Integrative Medicine (AIM) offers a variety of health-related products to serve our patients' immediate needs. And all of the products we sell have been scientifically tested by their manufacturers and independently reviewed for quality. If you would like to know more about the risks, benefits, and limits of knowledge relating to the products sold through AIM, please ask a physician. We make every effort to provide the products we sell to patients as cost-effectively as possible. Acting as a retailer for the manufacturers of the health-related products we sell, all health-related products sold by AIM have an industry-accepted markup. The Functional Medicine Approach Getting well and staying well often means taking selected supplements to boost your natural healing. And we believe that the judicious use of nutritional supplements, along with a healthy diet, can be an important part of your overall wellness plan. We make it easy for you to get your recommended daily supplements at our retail shop. We offer only the highest quality and most effective supplements to our patients. And our supplements are pharmacy grade, dye free, and physician reviewed. - Quality Matters in Supplements - By purchasing your supplements through the retail shop at Alliance Integrative Medicine, you can be sure you are buying the highest quality products now available. Not all supplements and vitamins are the same. Many manufacturers skimp on quality and sell products that aren't absorbed well or don't contain enough of the active ingredient to be helpful. - How Supplements Can Help - One important aspect of Transformational Medicine is achieving optimal health and function. We believe that the judicious use of nutritional supplements, along with a healthy diet, can be an important part of your overall wellness plan. - Personalized Nutrition - We all have unique nutritional needs. What is enough of one nutrient for one person may be far too little for another. A good example is vitamin D. In high doses, vitamin D can actually be toxic, but even a mild vitamin D deficiency can cause severe health problems. One person may need to supplement with only a few hundred International Units of vitamin D daily, while another may need thousands to achieve the same therapeutic level. To ensure that your supplement program is providing your body with the right nutrients and vitamins, please discuss your needs with our knowledgeable physicians or with our staff nutritionist.
