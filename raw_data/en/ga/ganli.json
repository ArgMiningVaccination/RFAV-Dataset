Making a difference for patients with severe eosinophilic asthma, HES, EGPA and COPD in India Severe Eosinophilic Asthma Your company launched Nucala in 2019 for severe eosinophilic asthma which is a rare type of asthma and usually diagnosed in adults. Given the rarity and complexity of the disease, Nucala has been able to make a positive difference in the lives of these patients by helping to reduce exacerbations and hospitalisation.

Adult vaccination While interest in adult or adolescent vaccination has never been high in India despite the fairly successful Universal Immunization Program (UIP), COVID-19 vaccination drives started conversations on adult vaccination and have given it an impetus. With increased life expectancy and a growing segment of the elderly population in India, healthy aging is emerging as a larger area of focus. A key intervention for healthy aging continues to be preventive health led by vaccination strategies. Adult vaccination is in a nascent stage in India with a large potential for growth. For instance, the virus that causes Shingles affects over 90% of adults aged 50 years and above.Opportunities Price control impact Unfavorable regulations on product prices may impact revenues and profit margins, as your company operates in a price regulated market. Your company periodically assesses its product portfolio to make it more diversified, with focus on high volume growth products and operational efficiencies to control costs. Once every five years, the National List of Essential Medicines (NLEM) is declared. In late 2022, the NLEM included your company's brands Ceftum and T -Bact in this price ceiling list. Your company's initiatives to mitigate the price impact on these key brands is to increase volumes, drive cost optimisation and leverage the launch of Shingrix to not only create a new category in India for adult vaccines but also make it a significant growth lever for your company. Molecules of some of your company's vaccines, such as that of Synflorix or Rotarix, have been included in the NIP. However, these NIP vaccines are now getting stabilised as the self-pay vaccines market begins to regain momentum. The overall growth of your company's existing vaccines portfolio is being driven by other vaccines such as Infanrix Hexa, Boostrix and Menveo. Supply chain disruptions Ongoing geopolitical crises have led to supply chain disruptions and rising cost of raw materials. Given the reliance on import of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), Indian pharmaceutical companies are susceptible to supply shocks and input material price increases. Your company is also prone to these near-term risks.Challenges* internal data Annual Report 2022-23 49Statutory reports Financial statements Corporate overviewGlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals Limited50 Your company's world-class manufacturing facility in Nashik, along with its contract manufacturing organisations (CMOs), have helped your company provide patients with high-quality pharmaceutical products.

In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (\"the Act\") in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended, (\"Ind AS\") and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2023, and its profit, total comprehensive income, its cash flows and the changes in equity for the year ended on that date. Basis for Opinion We conducted our audit of the standalone financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibility for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules made thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI's Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence obtained by us is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the standalone financial statements. Key Audit Matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have determined the matter described below to be the key audit matter to be communicated in our report. Sr. No.Key Audit Matter Auditor's Response 1 Information T echnology (IT) systems which impact financial reporting The IT systems of the Company form a critical component of the Company's financial reporting activities and impact all account balances. IT controls, in the context of our scope for the financial audit, primarily relate to access security and change control. The purpose of such controls is to prevent inappropriate changes being made to IT systems in relation to application functionality, transactional processing and direct changes to underlying data.Principal audit procedures performed with the assistance of our IT specialists: We identified the IT risks for each IT system based on our understanding of the flows of transactions and the IT environment. We determined whether each general IT control, individually or in combination with other controls, is appropriately designed to address the associated IT risk. We tested the design, implementation and operating effectiveness of the relevant general IT controls. We tested the mitigating manual controls for the IT control deficiencies noted around privilege access for certain scoped-in IT systems and the associated infrastructure. Information Other than the Financial Statements and Auditor's Report Thereon The Company's Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Management Discussion and Analysis, Board's Report including Annexures to Board's Report, Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report Annual Report 2022-23Statutory Reports Financial Statements Corporate Overview133 and Corporate Governance in Annual Report, but does not include the consolidated financial statements, standalone financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. Our opinion on the standalone financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the standalone financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the standalone financial statements or our knowledge obtained during the course of our audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Standalone Financial Statements The Company's Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation of these standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance including other comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in equity of the Company in accordance with the Ind AS and other accounting principles generally accepted in India. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the standalone financial statement that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the standalone financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. The Company's Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the Company's financial reporting process.Auditor's Responsibility for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the standalone financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these standalone financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the standalone financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Obtain an understanding of internal financial control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Company has adequate internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls. Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the management. Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the standalone financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals Limited134 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the standalone financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the standalone financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the standalone financial statements that, individually or in aggregate, makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable user of the standalone financial statements may be influenced. We consider quantitative materiality and qualitative factors in (i) planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work; and (ii) to evaluate the effect of any identified misstatements in the standalone financial statements. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication. Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements 1. As required by Section 143(3) of the Act, based on our audit, we report that: a.

(xix) On the basis of the financial ratios, ageing and expected dates of realization of financial assets and payment of financial liabilities, other information accompanying the financial statements and our knowledge of the Board of Directors and Management plans and based on our examination of the evidence supporting the assumptions, nothing has come to our attention, which causes us to believe that any material uncertainty exists as on the date of the audit report indicating that Company is not capable of meeting its liabilities existing at the date of balance sheet as and when they fall due within a period of one year from the balance sheet date. We, however, state that this is not an assurance as to the future viability of the Company. We further state that our reporting is based on the facts up to the date of the audit report and we neither give any guarantee nor any assurance that all liabilities falling due within a period of one year from the balance sheet date, will get discharged by the Company as and when they fall due. (xx) The Company has fully spent the required amount towards Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and there are no unspent CSR amount for the year requiring a transfer to a Fund specified in Schedule VII to the Companies Act or special account in compliance with the provision of sub-section (6) of section 135 of the said Act. Accordingly, reporting under clause (xx) of the Order is not applicable for the year. For DELOITTE HASKINS & SELLS LLP Chartered Accountants (Firm's Registration No. 117366W/W-100018) Rupen K.

Nadkarni Company Secretary FCS 10460 Mumbai, May 17, 2023 Mumbai, May 17, 2023Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2023 Annual Report 2022-23Statutory Reports Financial Statements Corporate Overview147 Note 1: Significant accounting policies A. GENERAL INFORMATION GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals Limited ('the Company') is a public company domiciled in India and is incorporated under the provisions of the Companies Act applicable in India. Its shares are listed on the BSE Ltd. (Bombay Stock Exchange) and the National Stock Exchange of India Ltd. (NSE). The registered office of the Company is located at Dr. Annie Besant Road, Worli, Mumbai 400 030. The Company is engaged inter alia, in the business of manufacturing, distributing and trading in pharmaceuticals. B. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES a) Statement of Compliance The standalone financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards (\"Ind AS\") notified under the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 and relevant provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 (\"the Act\") (as amended from time to time). b) Basis of preparation The standalone financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for the following: certain financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value; assets held for sale - measured at lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell; defined benefit plans - plan assets measured at fair value; and share-based payments. The financial statements are presented in INR and all values are rounded to the nearest lakhs (INR 00,000), except where otherwise indicated. c) Operating Cycle The operating cycle of the Company is the time between the acquisition of assets for processing and their realisation in cash or cash equivalents. When the Company's normal operating cycle is not clearly identifiable, it is assumed to be twelve months. d) Revenue recognition Revenue towards satisfaction of a performance obligation is measured at the amount of transaction price (net of variable consideration) allocated to that performance obligation. The transaction price of goods sold and services rendered is net of variable consideration on account of various discounts and schemes offered by the Company as part of the contract. This variable consideration is estimated based on the expected value of outflow. Revenue (net of variable consideration) is recognized only to the extent that it is highly probable that the amount will not be subject to significant reversal when uncertainty relating to its recognition is resolved. The specific recognition criteria described below must also be met before revenue is recognised. Sale of goods Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the goods have been passed on to the buyer as per contractual terms, at which time all the following conditions are satisfied: the company is recognizing revenue as and when it satisfies the performance obligation by transferring promised goods or services to a customer and customer obtains control of the same.; the Company retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with ownership nor effective control over the goods sold; the amount of revenue can be measured reliably; it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Company; the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably. Rendering of services Income from clinical research and data management services is recognised in the accounting period in which the services are rendered based on terms of the agreement.Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2023 GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals Limited148 Rights of return Certain contracts provide a customer with a right to return the goods within a specified period. The Company uses the expected value method to estimate the goods that will not be returned because this method best predicts the amount of variable consideration to which the Company will be entitled. The requirements in Ind AS 115 on constraining estimates of variable consideration are also applied in order to determine the amount of variable consideration that can be included in the transaction price. For goods that are expected to be returned, instead of revenue, the Company recognises a refund liability. T rade Receivables A receivable represents the Company's right to an amount of consideration that is unconditional (i.e., only the passage of time is required before payment of the consideration is due). Refer to accounting policies of financial assets in section (g) financial instruments. Dividends Dividend is recognised when the Company's right to receive the payment is established, it is probable that economic benefit associated with the dividend will flow to the Company, and the amount of dividend can be measured reliably. Interest Income Interest income is recorded using the Effective Interest Rate (EIR). Interest income is included in other income in the statement of profit and loss. Rental income Rental income arising from operating leases on investment properties is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease terms and is included in revenue in the statement of profit and loss due to its operating nature. e) Property, plant and equipment Freehold land is carried at historical cost. All other items of property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost, net of accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items. Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of any component accounted for as a separate asset is derecognised when replaced. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the statement of profit and loss during the reporting period in which they are incurred. Depreciation is provided on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as per the rates prescribed under Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013 or re-assessed useful life based on technical evaluation as under: Factory Buildings 30 to 50 years Other Buildings 60 years Plant and Equipment 10 to 15 years Personal Computers and Laptops 3 to 5 years Other Computer Equipment 4 years Furniture and Fixtures 10 years Office Equipment 5 years Vehicles 5 years Depreciation is provided pro-rata for the number of months available for use. Depreciation on sale / disposal of assets is provided pro-rata up to the end of the month of sale / disposal. An asset purchased where the actual cost does not exceed Rs. 5,000 is depreciated at the rate of 100%. Leasehold building, leasehold land and leasehold improvements are amortised over the period of the lease. Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amount. These are recognised as income or expense in the statement of profit and loss.Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2023 Annual Report 2022-23Statutory Reports Financial Statements Corporate Overview149 Cost of items of property, plant and equipment not ready for intended use as on the balance sheet date is disclosed as capital work in progress. Advances given towards acquisition of property, plant and equipment outstanding at each balance sheet date are disclosed as capital advance under other non-current assets. An item of property, plant and equipment and any significant part initially recognised is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the statement of profit and loss when the asset is derecognised. The residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of property, plant and equipment are reviewed at each financial year end and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate. f) Intangible assets Intangible assets are stated at cost of acquisition net of recoverable taxes less accumulated amortisation / depletion and impairment loss, if any. The cost comprises of purchase price, borrowing costs and any cost directly attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for the intended use. Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amount. These are recognised as income or expense in the statement of profit and loss. Cost of items of intangible assets not ready for intended use as on the balance sheet date are disclosed as intangible assets under development. Amortisation method and periods Amortisation is charged on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives. The estimated useful life and amortisation method are reviewed at the end of each annual reporting period, with the effect of any changes in the estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis. Software expenditure have been amortised over a period from 8 to 10 years. Distribution rights are amortised over the agreement / contract period. Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in the statement of profit and loss when the asset is derecognised. g) Impairment of non-financial assets Assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset's carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less cost of disposal and value in use. For the purpose of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash inflows which are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or group of assets (cash generating units). Non-financial assets that suffered an impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at the end of each reporting period. Impairment losses of continuing operations, including impairment on inventories, are recognised in the statement of profit and loss, except for properties previously revalued with the revaluation surplus taken to OCI. For such properties, the impairment is recognised in OCI up to the amount of any previous revaluation surplus. h) Leases The Company recognises right of use assets under lease arrangements in which it is the lessee. Rights to use assets owned by third parties under lease agreements are capitalised at the inception of the lease and recognised on the balance sheet. The corresponding liability to the lessor is recognised as a lease obligation. The carrying amount is subsequently increased to reflect interest on the lease liability and reduced by lease payments made. For calculating the discounted lease liability, the lessee's incremental borrowing rate is used. The incremental borrowing rate is calculated at the rate of interest at which the Company would have been able to borrow for a similar term and with a similar security the funds necessary to obtain a similar asset in a similar market.Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2023 GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals Limited150 Finance costs are charged to the income statement so as to produce a constant periodic rate of charge on the remaining balance of the obligations for each accounting period. Variable rents are not part of the lease liability and the right of use asset. These payments are charged to the income statement as incurred. If modifications or reassessments occur, the lease liability and right of use asset are re-measured. Right of use assets are depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the lease term. i) Financial instruments A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity. Financial assets (i) Classification The Company classifies its financial assets in the following measurement categories: - those to be measured subsequently at fair value (either through other comprehensive income, or through profit or loss), and - those measured at amortised cost. The classification depends on the Company's business model for managing financial assets and the contractual terms of the cash flows. For assets measured at fair value, gains and losses will either be recorded in the statement of profit and loss or other comprehensive income. For investments in debt instruments, this will depend on the business model in which the investment is held. For investments in equity instruments, this will depend on whether the Company has made an irrevocable election at the time of initial recognition to account for the equity investment at fair value through other comprehensive income. The Company reclassifies debt investments when and only when its business model for managing those assets changes. (ii) Measurement At initial recognition, the Company measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. T ransaction costs of financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are expensed in the statement of profit and loss. Financial assets with embedded derivatives are considered in their entirety when determining whether their cash flows are solely payment of principal and interest. Debt instruments Subsequent measurement of debt instruments depends on the Company's business model for managing the asset and the cash flow characteristics of the asset. There are three measurement categories into which the Company classifies its debt instruments: Amortised cost: Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows where those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest are measured at amortised cost. A gain or loss on a debt investment that is subsequently measured at amortised cost and is not part of a hedging relationship is recognised in the statement of profit and loss when the asset is derecognised or impaired. Interest income from these financial assets is included in other income using the effective interest rate method. Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI): Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows and for selling the financial assets, where assets cash flow represents solely payments of principal and interest, are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI). Movements in the carrying amount are taken through OCI, except for the recognition of impairment gains or losses, interest revenue and foreign exchange gains and losses which are recognised in the statement of profit and loss. When the financial asset is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2023 Annual Report 2022-23Statutory Reports Financial Statements Corporate Overview151 OCI is reclassified from equity to profit and loss and recognised in other expenses/ income. Interest income from these financial assets is included in other income using the effective interest rate method. Fair value through profit or loss: Assets that do not meet the criteria for amortised cost or FVOCI are measured at fair value through profit or loss. A gain or loss on a debt investment that is subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss and is not part of a hedging relationship is recognised in the statement of profit and loss and presented net in the statement of profit and loss within other expenses/ income in the period in which it arises. Interest income from these financial assets is included in other income. Equity instruments The Company subsequently measures all equity investments at fair value. Where the Company's management has elected to present fair value gains and losses on equity investments in other comprehensive income, there is no subsequent reclassification of fair value gains and losses to profit and loss. Dividends from such investments are recognised in the statement of profit and loss as other income when the Company's right to receive payments is established. Changes in the fair value of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss statement are recognised in other income/ expense in the statement of profit and loss. Impairment losses (and reversal of impairment losses) on equity investments measured at FVOCI are not reported separately from other changes in fair value. (iii) Impairment of financial assets The Company assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit losses associated with its assets carried at amortised cost and FVOCI debt instruments. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk. For trade receivables only, the Company applies the simplified approach permitted by Ind AS 109 \"Financial Instruments\", which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised from initial recognition of the receivables. (iv) Derecognition of financial assets A financial asset is derecognised only when the Company has transferred the rights to receive cash flows from the financial asset or retains the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the financial asset, but assumes a contractual obligation to pay the cash flows to one or more recipients. Where the entity has transferred an asset, the Company evaluates whether it has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset. In such cases, the financial asset is derecognised. Where the entity has not transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset, the financial asset is not derecognised. Where the entity has neither transferred a financial asset nor retains substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset, the financial asset is derecognised if the Company has not retained control of the financial asset. Where the Company retains control of the financial asset, the asset is continued to be recognised to the extent of continuing involvement in the financial asset. Financial liabilities and equity instruments Classification as debt or equity Debt and equity instruments issued by the Company are classified as either financial liability or as equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangements and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument. Equity instruments An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Company is recognised at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Repurchase of the Company's own equity instruments is recognised and deducted directly Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2023 GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals Limited152 in equity. No gain or loss is recognised in the statement of profit and loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Company's own equity instruments. Financial liabilities All financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Financial liabilities subsequently measured at amortised cost Financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, loans and borrowings, payables, as appropriate. Financial liabilities that are not held-for-trading and are not designated as at fair value through profit or loss are measured at amortised cost at the end of the subsequent accounting period. The carrying amount of financial liabilities that are subsequently measured at amortised cost are determined based on the effective interest method. Interest expense that is not capitalised as part of costs of an asset is included in the \"Finance costs\" line item. The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through the expected life of the financial liability, or, where appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount in initial recognition. Derecognition A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the statement of profit and loss. Offsetting of financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the standalone balance sheet if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously. j) Contributed equity Equity shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. k) Inventories Inventories are valued at lower of cost or net realisable value. Cost is determined on weighted average cost basis. The cost of work-in-progress (other than those lying at third party manufacturing sites which is valued at material cost) and finished goods comprises of raw materials, direct labour, other direct costs and related production overheads, but excludes interest expense. Net realisable value is the estimate of the selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the costs of completion and selling expenses. l) Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalent in the balance sheet comprise cash at banks and on hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less, which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. For the purpose of presentation in the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents includes cash on hand, demand deposits with banks, short-term balances (with an original maturity of three months or less from date of acquisition). m) Foreign currency transactions Items included in the standalone financial statements of the Company are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates ('the functional currency'). The standalone financial statements are presented in Indian Rupee (INR), which is Company's functional and presentation currency.Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2023 Annual Report 2022-23Statutory Reports Financial Statements Corporate Overview153 Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at year end exchange rates are generally recognised in the statement of profit and loss. Foreign exchange gains and losses are presented in the statement of profit and loss on a net basis within other expenses/ income. Non-monetary items that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was determined. T ranslation differences on assets and liabilities carried at fair value are reported as part of the fair value gain or loss. For example, translation differences on non-monetary assets and liabilities such as equity instruments held at fair value through profit or loss are recognised in the statement of profit and loss as part of the fair value gain or loss and translation differences on non-monetary assets such as equity investments classified as FVOCI are recognised in other comprehensive income. Non-monetary items that are measured based on historical cost in a foreign currency are not translated. n) T axes Income tax expense represents the sum of the current tax and deferred tax. Current tax charge is based on taxable profit for the year. T axable profit differs from profit as reported in the statement of profit and loss because some items of income or expense are taxable or deductible in different years or may never be taxable or deductible. The Company's liability for current tax is calculated using Indian tax rates and laws that have been enacted by the reporting date. Current tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority. The Company periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate. Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable in the future arising from temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. It is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are off-set against each other and the resultant net amount is presented in the balance sheet, if and only when the Company currently has a legally enforceable right to set-off the current income tax assets and liabilities. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. Current and deferred tax is recognised in the statement of profit and loss, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively. o) Employee benefits (a) Short T erm Employee Benefits Short-term employee benefits are expensed as the related service is provided. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid if the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably. Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2023 GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals Limited154 (b) Post-Employment Benefits (i) Defined Contribution Plans The Company's defined contribution plans are superannuation and employees' pension scheme (under the provisions of the Employees' Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952) since the Company has no further obligation beyond making the contributions. The Company's contributions to these plans are charged to the statement of profit and loss as incurred. (ii) Defined Benefits Plans \"Liability for defined benefit plans is provided on the basis of valuations, as at the balance sheet date, carried out by an independent actuary.\" Gratuity and Post-Retirement Medical The actuarial valuation method used for measuring the liability for gratuity and post-retirement medical is projected unit credit method. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the statement of other comprehensive income in the period of occurrence of such gains and losses. The obligations for gratuity and post-retirement medical are measured as the present value of estimated future cashflows discounted at rates reflecting the prevailing market yields of Indian Government securities as at the balance sheet date for the estimated term of the obligations. The estimate of future salary increases considered takes into account the inflation, seniority, promotion and other relevant factors. The expected rate of return of plan assets is the Company's expectation of the average long term rate of return expected on investments of the fund during the estimated term of the obligations. Plan assets are measured at fair value as at the balance sheet date. Provident Fund Provident fund contributions are made to a T rust administered by the Company. The Company has an obligation to make good the shortfall, if any, between the return from the investments of the T rust and the notified interest rate. The actuarial valuation method, carried out by an independent actuary, used for measuring the liability for provident fund is projected accrued benefit method. This approach determines the present value of the interest rate guarantee under three interest rate scenarios: base case scenario, rising interest rate scenario and falling interest rate scenario. The defined benefit obligation of the interest rate guarantee is set equal to the average of the present values determined under these scenarios in respect of accumulated provident fund contributions as at the valuation date. (c) Other Long T erm Benefit Plans The liabilities for earned leave and sick leave are not expected to be settled wholly within 12 months after the end of the period in which the employees render the related service. They are therefore measured as the present value of expected future payments to be made in respect of services provided by employees up to the end of the reporting period using the projected unit credit method. The benefits are discounted using the market yields at the end of the reporting period that have terms approximating to the terms of the related obligation. Re-measurements as a result of experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in the statement of profit and loss. (d) The expenditure on voluntary retirement schemes is charged to the statement of profit and loss in the year in which it is incurred. (e) Share Based Payment Arrangements In terms of a long-term incentive plan, the eligible members of the senior management are entitled to receive cash settled awards at the end of a three year 'restricted period', provided they remain in continuous employment with the Company for the aforesaid period. The value of such incentive is based on the price of shares of GlaxoSmithKline Plc, U.K. The above scheme is applicable for all grants to employees till 2022. Starting 2023, Incentives in the form of shares are provided to employees under share award schemes.Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2023 Annual Report 2022-23Statutory Reports Financial Statements Corporate Overview155 The fair values of these awards are calculated at their grant dates using a Black-Scholes option pricing model and charged to the income statement with a corresponding credit to ESOP Reserve over the relevant vesting periods. Recharge by the Group Company is accounted with a corresponding debit to ESOP Reserve. p) Investment property Property that is held for long-term rental yields or for capital appreciation or both, and that is not occupied by the Company, is classified as investment property. Investment property is measured initially at its cost, including related transaction costs and where applicable borrowing costs. Subsequent expenditure is capitalised to the assets carrying amount only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the expenditure will flow to the Company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance costs are expensed when incurred. When part of an investment property is replaced, the carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised. Based on technical evaluation the following is the best estimate of period over which investment property is depreciated on a straight-line basis. Asset Management estimate of useful life Factory Building 30 Years Freehold Land - Any gain or loss on disposal of an investment property is recognised in statement of profit and loss. q) Investment in subsidiary Investment in subsidiary is carried at cost less impairment loss, if any, in the separate Standalone Financial Statements. r) Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the period attributable to the owners of Company by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the period. The weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the period and for all periods presented is adjusted for events, such as bonus shares, other than the conversion of potential equity shares, that have changed the number of equity shares outstanding, without a corresponding change in resources. For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, the profit for the period attributable to the owners of the Company and the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period is adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential equity shares. s) Exceptional items When items of income or expense are of such nature, size or incidence that their disclosure is necessary to explain the performance of the Company for the year, the company makes a disclosure of the nature and amount of such items separately under the head \"Exceptional items\". t) Segment reporting Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM). The Managing Director of the Company has been identified as CODM and he is responsible for allocating the resources, assess the financial performance and position of the Company and makes strategic decisions. The Company has identified one reportable segment \"Pharmaceuticals\" based on the information reviewed by the CODM. Refer note 52 for segment information presented. u) Provision and contingent liabilities A provision is recognised if as a result of a past event, the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) that can be estimated reliably and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are recognised at the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date. If the effect of time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre tax rate that reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. The increase in the provision due to passage of time is recognised as an interest expense.Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2023 GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals Limited156 A contingent liability exists when there is a possible but not probable obligation, or a present obligation that may, but probably will not, require an outflow of resources, or a present obligation whose amount cannot be estimated reliably. Contingent liabilities do not warrant provisions but are disclosed unless the possibility of outflow of resources is remote. v) Discontinued operations and non-current assets held for sale Discontinued operation is a component of the Company that has been disposed of or classified as held for sale and represents a major line of business. Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount is intended to be recovered principally through a sale (rather than through continuing use) when the asset (or disposal group) is available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sale of such asset (or disposal group) and the sale is highly probable and is expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification. Non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale are measured at lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. w) Business Combination Common control business combination is accounted using the pooling of interest method where the Company is transferee. Assets and liabilities of the combining entities are reflected at their carrying amounts and no new asset or liability is recognised. Identity of reserves of the transferor company is preserved by reflecting them in the same form in the Company's financial statements in which they appeared in the financial statement of the transferor company. The excess between the amount of consideration paid over the share capital of the transferor company is recognised as a negative amount and the same is disclosed as capital reserve on business combination. The financial information in the financial statements in respect of prior periods is restated from the beginning of the preceding period in the financial statements if the business combination date is prior to that date. However, if business combination date is after that date, the financial information in the financial statements is restated from the date of business combination. Standards issued but not yet effective Ministry of Corporate Affairs (\"MCA\") notifies new standard or amendments to the existing standards. There is no such notification which would have been applicable to the Company from April 1, 2023.Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2023 Annual Report 2022-23Statutory Reports Financial Statements Corporate Overview157 Note 2 : Critical estimates and judgements The preparation of Standalone Financial Statements requires the use of accounting estimates which, by definition, will seldom equal the actual results. Management also needs to exercise judgement in applying the Company's accounting policies. This note provides an overview of the areas that involved a higher degree of judgement or complexity, and of items which are more likely to be materially adjusted due to estimates and assumptions turning out to be different than those originally assessed. a Recognition and measurement of defined benefit obligations The obligation arising from defined benefit plan is determined on the basis of actuarial assumptions. Key actuarial assumptions include discount rate, trends in salary escalation and vested future benefits and life expectancy. The discount rate is determined by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on government bonds. The period to maturity of the underlying bonds correspond to the probable maturity of the post-employment benefit obligations. b Estimation of useful life Useful lives of tangible assets and intangible assets are based on the estimate by the management. The useful lives as estimated are same as prescribed in Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013. In cases, where the useful lives are different from that prescribed in Schedule II, they are based on management estimate, taking into account the nature of the asset, the estimated usage of the asset, the operating conditions of the asset, past history of replacement, anticipated technological changes, manufacturers' warranties and maintenance support. Assumptions also need to be made, when the Company assesses, whether an asset may be capitalized and which components of the cost of the asset may be capitalised. The useful lives and residual values of Company's assets are determined by management at the time the asset is acquired and reviewed annually for appropriateness. The lives are based on historical experience with similar assets as well as anticipation of future events which may impact their life such as changes in technology. c Provisions and contingent liabilities The Company exercises judgement in measuring and recognising provisions and the exposures to contingent liabilities related to pending litigation or other outstanding claims subject to negotiated settlement, mediation, arbitration or government regulation, as well as other contingent liabilities. Judgement is necessary in assessing the likelihood that a pending claim will succeed, or a liability will arise, and to quantify the possible range of the financial settlement. Because of the inherent uncertainty in this evaluation process, actual losses may be different from the originally estimated provision. d Impairment of assets The Company reviews the carrying amounts of its property, plant and equipment, Capital work in progress and intangible assets, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Further details on the Company's accounting policies on this are set out in the accounting policy above. Determining whether an asset is impaired requires an estimation of the recoverable amount, which requires company to estimate the Fair value less cost of disposal.Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2023 GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals Limited158 Note 3 : Property, Plant and Equipment (` in lakhs) Gross Carrying Value Accumulated Depreciation Net Carrying Value As at April 1, 2022Additions Disposals As at March 31, 2023As at April 1, 2022Charge for the Ye a rOn DisposalsImpairment As at March 31, 2023As at March 31, 2023 Freehold land 2.00 - - 2.00 - - - 2.00 Leasehold land lakhs) Gross Carrying Value Accumulated Depreciation Net Carrying Value As at April 1, 2021Additions Disposals As at April 1, 2022As at April 1, 2021Charge for the Ye a rOn DisposalsImpairment (Refer Note 3(b) below)As at April 1, 2022As at April 1, 2022 Freehold land 2.00 - - 2.00 - - - - 2.00 Leasehold land 2,22.93 0.05 Note 3 (a): Plant and equipment includes computers.

These comprise of two vacant land sites (March 31, 2022: two vacant land sites) that are not in operational use at present. In the view of the management, the fair market value of the land sites is not reliably measurable as there are very few recent transactions of comparable composition of these properties in the market. Further, the fair market value will be subject to numerous municipal deductions dependent upon the current use and intended use of the property. Based on the above, it is not possible to ascertain and disclose the range of fair market value. The estimated Ready Reckoner value at year end, based on latest published data and on current stated use, totals `225,95.73 lakhs (March 31, 2022: `225,95.73 lakhs). Ready Reckoner rates are the prices of residential property, land or commercial property for a given area that is published and regulated by the respective State Governments as a guide towards payment of stamp duty at the time of transaction. The Ready Reckoner Value is regarded as a gross value and does not represent the underlying fair market value of the properties. The company will further detail the fair value of its investment properties upon entering a committed agreement with a third party, unless an alternative reliable estimate of the fair value is attainable.Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2023 Annual Report 2022-23Statutory Reports Financial Statements Corporate Overview161 Note 5 : Intangible assets (` in lakhs) Gross Carrying Value Accumulated Depreciation Net Carrying Value As at April 1, 2022Additions Disposals As at March 31, 2023As at April 1, 2022Charge for the Ye a rAs at March 31, 2023As at March 31, 2023 Intangible Assets Computer lakhs) Gross Carrying Value Accumulated Depreciation Net Carrying Value As at April 1, 2021Additions Disposals As at April 1, 2022As at April 1, 2021Charge for the Ye a rAs at April 1, 2022As at April 1, 2022 Investments (` in lakhs) As at March 31, 2023 As at March 31, 2022 Unquoted Equity Instruments In SubsidiaryBiddle Sawyer Limited 47,61.31 47,61.31 9,60,000 Equity Shares of ` 10 each fully paidLess: Provision for Impairment (23,12.00) (23,12.00) 24,49.31 24,49.31 Note 7 : Non-current financial assets -

Note 42 : Pricing Matters The demand of `71,79.00 lakhs made by the Central Government on the Company in respect of Betamethasone bulk drugs and formulations made therefrom during the period May 1981 to August 1987 has been under litigation for a period spanning over 30 years. Pursuant to the special leave petition of the Central Government in the Supreme Court of India against the Delhi High Court's Judgment and Order dated October 19, 2001 which was held in favour of the Company, the Supreme Court has, vide its Judgement and Order dated March 31, 2011, upheld the demand. The Company had accrued a liability of `18,68.00 lakhs in earlier years and a further provision of `53,11.00 lakhs was accrued in 2011. Based on legal advice, the Company has filed an application in the Supreme Court seeking, inter alia, clarifications on some aspects of the Judgement and directions for recomputation of the demand. Simultaneously, the Company without prejudice to and subject to the outcome of the application filed in the Supreme Court, has tendered as a further deposit, an amount of `63,60.00 lakhs, which together with the amount of `8,19.00 lakhs previously deposited with the Government, aggregates the demand of `71,79.00 lakhs made by the Government in November 1990. The Company filed a review petition in the Supreme Court which was rejected in March 2012. In October 1996, the Government had claimed interest of `117,66.00 lakhs for the period May 12, 1981 to October 17, 1996, for which no provision was made in earlier years. The Government had vide letter dated May 4, 2011 called upon the Company to discharge the entire liability, including upto date interest calculated at 15% p.a., and had vide letter dated October 10, 2011, raised a demand on the Company for the interest amount amounting to `247,44.00 lakhs. Without prejudice to the position that interest is not payable, the Company had recognized a provision of `247,44.00 lakhs in respect of the Government's claim for interest in 2011. The Company had filed a writ petition at Delhi High Court against the above demand which had been admitted. The Company also filed stay applications which were dismissed and the Company had filed a Special Leave Petition (SLP) before the Supreme Court for stay of the interest demand until final determination of the writ petition filed in the Delhi High Court. The Supreme Court on hearing the above SLP, passed an order on April 3, 2012. The said order stayed the Demand Notice dated October 10, 2011 during the pendency of the writ petition at the Delhi High Court subject to the Company depositing `136,82.00 lakhs in three equal installments within Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2023 Annual Report 2022-23Statutory Reports Financial Statements Corporate Overview181 six month's time from the date of order. All three instalments have been deposited with the Government. The Supreme Court, vide its order dated October 5, 2012, directed the Delhi High Court to dispose of the writ petition as expeditiously as possible. The Company's counsel has been routinely appearing in the matter and urging the Delhi High Court to hear the matter expeditiously considering it is at final hearing stage and has been pending for a long time. The counsel has also cited the significant sums involved; however, the Court is not inclined to take this matter out of turn. Next date of the matter is July 21, 2023. Note 43 : Matters in respect of erstwhile Burroughs Wellcome (India) Limited (BWIL): (i) The Government of India, Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilisers, New Delhi, passed a final order on July 21, 1993, directing erstwhile BWIL to pay an amount of ` 1,91.15 lakhs along with interest due thereon from the date of default into the Drugs Prices Equalisation Account (DPEA) in respect of a bulk drug procured by erstwhile BWIL during the period April 1981 to April 1983. Erstwhile BWIL filed a writ petition in August 1993 which was admitted by the Bombay High Court. After hearing both the parties, the High Court granted an interim injunction restraining the Government of India from taking any action in furtherance of and/ or implementation of the order dated July 21, 1993 or from in any manner seeking to compel erstwhile BWIL to deposit any amount into the DPEA, pending the hearing and final disposal of the petition on the condition that erstwhile BWIL furnishes a bank guarantee for ` 2,00.00 lakhs from a nationalised bank and undertakes to pay the amount demanded with interest at the rate of 20% per annum in case the petition fails. Erstwhile BWIL had accordingly furnished the required bank guarantee. If calculated on the basis of correct data, taking into account set offs claimable for earlier years for which data has been provided by erstwhile BWIL, no amount will be payable by the Company and accordingly no provision in that respect is considered necessary. The Company's stand that the demand is not sustainable has been confirmed by an eminent counsel. The Government of India's application in the Supreme Court praying that the writ petition be transferred to the Supreme Court from the Bombay High Court was not allowed and the Company's writ petition is pending hearing by the Bombay High Court. (ii) Erstwhile BWIL had made an application to the Government of India for approval under Section 198(4) of the Companies Act, 1956, in respect of payment to the Managing Director and three whole time Directors amounting to ` 10.93 lakhs for the year ended August 31, 1986, which was in accordance with the minimum remuneration provided in the agreements entered into with them prior to erstwhile BWIL becoming public, which required such Government of India's sanction. The approval is still awaited. Note 44 : Matters in respect of erstwhile SmithKline Beecham (India) Limited: (i) `1,44.44 lakhs received from Beckman Instruments International S.A. on account of disputed alleged additional commission has been included under non-current provisions and Income tax paid thereon aggregating `64.77 lakhs has been included under other non-current assets. The Company is contesting the matter with the concerned authorities. (ii) Refund of surtax `96.81 lakhs, and interest thereon amounting to `48.52 lakhs, received during 1994, have not been adjusted against the provision for tax in the books of accounts and recognised as income respectively, since the Income tax department had filed a reference application against the income tax tribunal's order which was pending before the High Court of Karnataka. The Company has received an order dated April 18, 2007 from the High Court of Karnataka which is partially in the Company's favour. On the basis of the aforesaid order, Income T ax Appellate T ribunal (ITAT), Bangalore will pass an order giving directions. On receipt of the ITAT order, the Company will take appropriate steps in the matter.Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2023 GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals Limited182 Note 45 : Disclosures as required by Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development Act, 2006 are as under: (` in lakhs) As at March 31, 2023 As at March 31, 2022 (a) The principal amount and the interest due thereon remaining unpaid to suppliers (i) Principal 4,30.20 7,19.19 (ii) Interest due thereon 51.75 55.21 4,81.95 7 ,74.40 (b) (i) The delayed payments of principal amount paid beyond the appointed date during the entire accounting year18,15.16 28,95.80 (ii) Interest actually paid under Section 16 of the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development Act, 2006- - (c) (i) Normal Interest accrued during the year, for all the delayed payments, as per the agreed terms- - (ii) Normal Interest payable for the period of delay in making payment, as per the agreed terms- - (d) (i) T otal Interest accrued during the year - - (ii) T otal Interest accrued during the year and remaining unpaid - - The above information regarding Micro, Small and Medium enterprises has been determined to the extent such parties have been identified on the basis of information available with the Company.

Fair Value Hierarchy This section explains the judgements and estimates made in determining the fair values of the financial instruments that are (a) recognised and measured at fair value and (b) measured at amortised cost and for which fair values are disclosed in the Standalone Financial Statements. (a) Financial instruments that are recognised and measured at fair value T o provide an indication about the reliability of the inputs used in determining fair value, the Company has classified its financial instruments into the three levels prescribed under the accounting standard. Level 1 : It includes financial instruments measured using quoted prices Level 2 : The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined using valuation techniques which maximise the use of observable market data and rely as little as possible on entity-specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2. Level 3 : Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable.

C. Financial risk management The Company has exposure to the following risks arising from financial instruments: \u009f Credit risk ; \u009f Liquidity risk ; and \u009f Market riskNotes to the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2023 GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals Limited190 Risk management framework The Company's board of directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Company's risk management framework. The board of directors has established the Risk Management Committee, which is responsible for developing and monitoring the Company's risk management policies. The committee reports regularly to the board of directors on its activities The Company's risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Company, to set appropriate risk limits and controls and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Company's activities. The Company, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to maintain a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations. The audit committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Company's risk management policies and procedures, and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Company. The audit committee is assisted in its oversight role by internal audit. Internal audit undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the audit committee. Credit Risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Company's receivables from customers. T rade and other receivables The Company's trade receivables are largely from sales made to wholesale customers and direct sales to hospitals with a smaller proportion of sales to Indian Government Institutions. The Company's exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer, demographics of the customer and the default risk of the industry. The Company manages credit risk through credit approvals, establishing credit limits and continuously monitoring the creditworthiness of customers to which the Company grants credit terms in the normal course of business. Exposures to customers outstanding at the end of each reporting period are reviewed to determine incurred and expected credit losses and the Company establishes an allowance for doubtful debts and impairment that represents its estimate of expected losses in respect of trade receivables. Historical trends of impairment of trade receivables do not reflect any significant credit losses. Given that the macro economic indicators have undergone change, it has not affected the customers of the Company substantially, hence the Company expects the historical trend of minimal credit losses to continue. The impairment loss as at March 31, 2023 relates to customers that have defaulted on their payments to the Company and are not expected to be able to pay their outstanding balances, mainly due to economic circumstances. In case of receivables from wholesale customers and hospitals, the Company has followed a provision approach consistent with expected credit loss approach as per IndAS 109.Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2023 Annual Report 2022-23Statutory Reports Financial Statements Corporate Overview191 Summary of the Company's ageing of outstanding from various customers and impairment for expected Credit Loss is as follows: (` in lakhs) As at March 31, 2023 Gross Carrying amountExpected Credit LossesCarrying amount of trade receivables (net of Expected Credit loss) Not due 178,10.70 3.91 178,06.79 Past due days otal 205,24.30 12,86.80 at March 31, 2022 Gross Carrying amountExpected Credit LossesCarrying amount of trade receivables (net of Expected Credit loss) Not due 191,81.13 6.39 191,74.74 Past due 731-1095 days 4,69.21 T otal 225,47 .13 20,23.24 205,23.89 Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they become due. The Company manages its liquidity risk by ensuring, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risk to the Company's reputation. The Company's principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents and the cash flow that is generated from operations. The Company has no outstanding bank borrowings. The Company believes that the working capital is sufficient to meet its current requirements. Any short-term surplus cash generated, over and above the amount required for working capital management and other operational requirements, are retained as Cash and Investment in short term deposits with banks and mutual funds. The said investments are made in instruments with appropriate maturities and sufficient liquidity. As of March 31, 2023, the Company had working capital of ` 1149,69.10 lakhs, including cash and cash equivalents of ` 29,74.32 lakhs, investments in term deposits (i.e., bank certificates of deposit having original maturities of more than 3 months but less than 12 months) of ` 1100,89 lakhs and Current investments of ` 518,28.88 lakhs.

Market risk is attributable to all market risk-sensitive financial instruments, all foreign currency receivables and payables. The Company is exposed to market risk primarily related to foreign exchange rate risk and risk on its investments. However since the investments are in overnight and liquid funds the risk is negligible. Currency risk The fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates may have potential impact on the statement of profit and loss, where any transaction references more than one currency or where assets/liabilities are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity. The Company is exposed to currency risk on account of its receivables and payables in foreign currency. The functional currency of the Company is Indian Rupee. The Company has exposure to GBP, USD, EUR and other currencies. The Company has not hedged this foreign currency exposure and strives to achieve asset liability offset of foreign currency exposure.Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2023 Annual Report 2022-23Statutory Reports Financial Statements Corporate Overview193 Exposure to currency risk The Company's exposure to foreign currency risk at the end of the reporting period is as follows: (` in lakhs) As at March 31, 2023 As at March 31, 2022 GBP USD EUR Others GBP USD EUR Others Current Financial assets 122,16.98 - - - 45,84.20 - (6.03) - - - (6.03) (2.71) - Net statement of financial position exposure105,30.28 (32,89.45) (1,62.50) (3,37 .43) 29,23.52 (80,53.11) (2,20.97) - Sensitivity analysis A reasonably possible strenghtening / weakening of the respective foreign currencies with respect to functional currency of Company would result in increase or decrease in profit or loss and equity as shown in table below.

The policies set out below have been consistently applied during the years presented. The financial statements are presented in INR and all values are rounded to the nearest lakhs (INR 00,000), except where otherwise indicated. b) Property, plant and equipment Freehold land is carried at historical cost. All other items of property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less depreciation. Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items. Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of any component accounted for as a separate asset is derecognised when replaced. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to profit or loss during the reporting period in which they are incurred. Depreciation is provided on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as per the rates prescribed under: Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013 or re-assessed useful life based on technical evaluation as under: Factory Buildings 30 years Other Buildings 60 years Plant and Equipment 10 years Personal Computers and Laptops 3 to 5 years Other Computer Equipment 4 years Furniture and Fixtures 10 years Office Equipment 5 years Vehicles 5 years Depreciation is provided pro-rata for the number of months availability for use. Depreciation on sale / disposal of assets is provided pro-rata up to the end of the month of sale / disposal. An asset purchased where the actual cost does not exceed ` 5,000 is depreciated at the rate of 100%. Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amount. These are recognised as income or expense in the statement of profit and loss. Advances given towards acquisition of Property, plant and equipment outstanding at each balance sheet date are disclosed as Capital Advance under Other non current assets. c) Investments and other financial assets The Company classifies its financial assets in the following measurement categories: - those to be measured subsequently at fair value (either through other comprehensive income, or through profit or loss), and - those measured at amortised cost. The classification depends on the Company's business model for managing financial assets and the contractual terms of the cash flows. For assets measured at fair value, gains and losses will either be recorded in profit or loss or other comprehensive income. For investments in debt instruments, this will depend on the business model in which the investment is held. For investments in equity instruments, this will depend on whether the Company has made an irrevocable election at the time of initial recognition to account for the equity investment at fair value through other comprehensive income. d) Inventories Inventories are valued at lower of cost or net realisable value. Cost is determined on first-in first-out basis. The cost of work-in-progress (other than those lying at third party manufacturing sites which is valued at material cost) and finished goods comprises of raw materials, direct labour, other direct costs and related production overheads, but excludes interest expense. Net realisable value is the estimate Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2023 GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals Limited214 of the selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the costs of completion and selling expenses. e) Revenue Recognition Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the goods are delivered and titles have passed, at which time all the following conditions are satisfied: the company is recognizing revenue as and when it satisfies the performance obligation by transferring promised goods or services to a customer and customer obtains control of the same.; the Company retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with ownership nor effective control over the goods sold; the amount of revenue can be measured reliably; it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Company; the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably. Interest Income Interest income is recorded using the Effective Interest Rate (EIR). Interest income is included in other income in the statement of profit and loss. f) Foreign Currency transactions Items included in the Standalone Financial Statements of the Company are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates ('the functional currency'). The Standalone Financial Statements are presented in Indian rupee (INR), which is Company's functional and presentation currency. Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at year end exchange rates are generally recognised in profit or loss. Foreign exchange gains and losses are presented in the statement of profit and loss on a net basis within other expenses/ other income. Non-monetary items that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was determined. T ranslation differences on assets and liabilities carried at fair value are reported as part of the fair value gain or loss. For example, translation differences on non monetary assets and liabilities such as equity instruments held at fair value through profit or loss are recognised in profit or loss as part of the fair value gain or loss and translation differences on non-monetary assets such as equity investments classified as FVOCI are recognised in other comprehensive income. Non-monetary items that are measured based on historical cost in a foreign currency are not translated. g) T axes on Income Income tax expense represents the sum of the current tax and deferred tax. Current tax charge is based on taxable profit for the year. T axable profit differs from profit as reported in the Statement of Profit and Loss because some items of income or expense are taxable or deductible in different years or may never be taxable or deductible. The Company's liability for current tax is calculated using Indian tax rates and laws that have been enacted by the reporting date. Current tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority. The Company periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate. Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable in the future arising from temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the Balance Sheet and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. It is accounted for using the Balance Sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2023Statutory Reports Financial Statements Corporate Overview Annual Report 2022-23215 probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are off-set against each other and the resultant net amount is presented in the Balance Sheet, if and only when the Company currently has a legally enforceable right to set-off the current income tax assets and liabilities. Current and deferred tax is recognised in profit or loss, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively. h) Provision and contingent liabilities A provision is recognised if as a result of a past event, the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) that can be estimated reliably and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are recognised at the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the Balance Sheet date. If the effect of time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre tax rate that reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. The increase in the provision due to passage of time is recognised as an interest expense. A contingent liability exists when there is a possible but not probable obligation, or a present obligation that may, but probably will not, require an outflow of resources, or a present obligation whose amount cannot be estimated reliably. Contingent liabilities do not warrant provisions but are disclosed unless the possibility of outflow of resources is remote i) Other Accounting Policies These are consistent with the generally accepted accounting principles.2 Investment Property (` in lakhs) As at March 31, 2023 As at March 31, 2022 Gross carrying amount Opening gross carrying amount/ Deemed cost2.08 2.08 Additions (Improvements) - - Deduction - - Closing gross carrying amount 2.08 2.08 Accumulated Depreciation Opening Accumulated Depreciation - - Depreciation charge - - Closing Accumulated Depreciation - - Net carrying amount 2.08 2.08 Estimation of fair value The Company has a land site that have been considered as Investment Property as it is not currently operational at present. In view of management, the fair market value of the land site is not reliably measurable as there are very few recent transactions of comparable composition of these properties in the market. Further, the fair market value will be subject to numerous municipal deductions dependent upon the current use and intended use of the property. Consequently, it is not possible to ascertain and disclose the range of fair market value. The estimated Ready Reckoner at year end, based on latest published data and current stated use, totals ` 13,43.75 lakhs for current year (` 24,75.15 lakhs for previous year). Ready Reckoner rates are the prices of the residential property, land or commercial property for a given area that is published and regulated by the respective State Governments as a guide towards payment of stamp duty at the time of transaction. The Ready Reckoner is regarded as a gross value and does not represent the underlying fair market value to the Company.

The Company had filed its reply contending that no amount is payable into DPEA.49.29 49.2916 (i) Drugs Prices Equalisation Account The Company received a letter dated 20th/24th August, 1998 from the Central Government demanding an amount of ` 4,40,79,918 comprising ` 1,42,74,110 in respect of prices relating to Salbutamol formulations during the period April, 1979 to December, 1983 with interest thereon amounting to ` 2,98,05,808 upto 31st July, 1998. The Company had been legally advised that the demand of ` 1,42,74,110 is not sustainable and it, therefore follows that the interest demand also cannot be sustained. The total demand has been challenged by the Company in a Writ Petition filed in the Bombay High Court. The Bombay High Court has granted an interim stay of the demand, subject to the Company depositing 50% of the principal amount. Accordingly, the Company has deposited an amount of ` 71,50,000 with the Government on 3rd May, 1999. This is a normal interim order passed by the High court in such matters and does not in any way reflect upon the merits or otherwise of the case. The amount will be refunded if the Company succeeds at the final hearing of the matter. The Government's application in the Supreme Court praying that this writ petition be transferred to the Supreme Court from the Bombay High Court was not allowed and the Company's writ petition will now be heard by the Bombay High Court.Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2023Statutory Reports Financial Statements Corporate Overview Annual Report 2022-23219 Note 17: Share Capital (` in lakhs) As at March 31, 2023 As at March 31, 2022 Authorised 15,00,000 (Previous year : 15,00,000) Equity each1,50.00 1,50.00 ISSUED, SUBSCRIBED & PAID-UP: 9,60,000 (Previous year : 9,60,000) Equity Shares of `10 each fully paid up (of the above 7,50,000 ordinary shares have been allotted as fully paid-up Bonus shares by capitalisation of General Reserve) 96.00 96.00 TOTAL 96.00 96.00 a) Shares held by holding company Equity Shares of ` 10 each 9,60,000 (Previous year : 9,60,000) held by GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals Limited, the Holding Company 96.00 96.00 As at March 31, 2023 As at March 31, 2022 Number of Shares` In Lakhs Number of Shares` In Lakhs a) Reconciliation of the number of shares Balance at the beginning of the year 9,60,000 96.00 9,60,000 96.00 Issued during the year - - - - Balance at the end of the year 9,60,000 96.00 9,60,000 96.00 b) Rights, preferences and restrictions attached to equity shares: The Company has only one class of equity shares having a par value of ` 10/ - per share.

Financial risk management The Company has exposure to the following risks arising from financial instruments: Liquidity risk Market risk Risk management framework The Company's B oard of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Company's risk management framework. The B oard of Directors has established the Risk Management Committee, which is responsible for developing and monitoring the Company's risk management policies. The committee reports regularly to the Board of Directors on its activities The Company's risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Company, to set appropriate risk limits and controls and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Company's activities. The Company, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to maintain a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations. The audit committee of the Holding company oversees how management monitors compliance with the C ompany's risk management policies and procedures, and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Company. The audit committee is assisted in its oversight role by internal audit. Internal audit undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the audit committee. Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they become due. The Company manages its liquidity risk by ensuring, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risk to the Company's reputation. The Company's principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents and the cash flow that is generated from operations. The Company has no outstanding bank borrowings. The Company believes that the working capital is sufficient to meet its current requirements. Any short-term surplus cash generated, over and above the amount required for working capital management and other operational requirements, are retained as Cash and Investment in short term deposits with banks. The said investments are made in instruments with appropriate maturities and sufficient liquidity. As of March 31, 2023, the Company had working capital of ` 18,20.7 lakhs, including cash and cash equivalents of ` 5,19.77 lakhs, investments in term deposits (i.e., bank certificates of deposit having original maturities of more than 3 months and less twelve months) of ` nil. As of March 31, 2022, the Company had working capital of ` 13,25.01 lakhs, including cash and cash equivalents of ` 5,39.59 lakhs, investments in term deposits (i.e., bank certificates of deposit having original maturities of more than 3 months and less twelve months) of ` nil.

Market risk is attributable to all market risk-sensitive financial instruments, all foreign currency receivables and payables. The Company is exposed to market risk primarily related to foreign exchange rate risk. Currency risk The fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates may have potential impact on the profit and loss account, where any transaction references more than one currency or where assets/liabilities are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity. The Company is exposed to currency risk on account of its receivables and payables in foreign currency. The functional currency of the Company is Indian Rupee. Exposure to currency risk The Company's exposure to foreign currency risk at the end of the reporting period is as follows: (` in lakhs) As at March 31, 2023 As at March 31, 2022 USD GBP USD GBP T rade payables (3,15.85) - - Current financial assets - Others 34.68 12,96.32 Net statement of financial position exposure(3,15.85) 34.68 - 12,96.32 Sensitivity analysis A reasonably possible strengthening / weakening of the respective foreign currencies with respect to functional currency of Company would result in increase or decrease in profit or loss and equity as shown in table below.

As per our report of even date attached For and on behalf of the Board For CORNELIUS & DAVAR CHARTERED ACCOUNTANTS (Firm's Registration May 10, 2023GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals Limited228 Independent Auditor's Report T o The Members of GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals Limited Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements Opinion We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of GLAXOSMITHKLINE PHARMACEUTICALS LIMITED (\"the Parent\") and its subsidiary, (the Parent and its subsidiary together referred to as \"the Group\") which comprise the Consolidated Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, and the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows and the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity for the year then ended, and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, and based on the consideration of the report of the other auditor on separate financial statements of the subsidiary referred to in the Other Matters section below, the aforesaid consolidated financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (\"the Act\") in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended ('Ind AS'), and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the consolidated state of affairs of the Group as at March 31, 2023, and their consolidated profit, their consolidated total comprehensive income, their consolidated cash flows and their consolidated changes in equity for the year ended on that date. Basis for Opinion We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143 (10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibility for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules made thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI's Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence obtained by us and the audit evidence obtained by the other auditor in terms of their report referred to in the Other Matters section below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements.Key Audit Matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have determined the matter described below to be the key audit matter to be communicated in our report. Sr. No.Key Audit Matter Auditor's Response 1 Information T echnology (IT) systems which impact financial reporting The IT systems of the Parent form a critical component of the Group's financial reporting activities and impact all account balances. IT controls, in the context of our scope for the financial audit, primarily relate to access security and change control. The purpose of such controls is to prevent inappropriate changes being made to IT systems in relation to application functionality, transactional processing and direct changes to underlying data..Principal audit procedures performed with the assistance of our IT specialists: We identified the IT risks for each IT system based on our understanding of the flows of transactions and the IT environment. We determined whether each general IT control, individually or in combination with other controls, is appropriately designed to address the associated IT risk. We tested the design, implementation and operating effectiveness of the relevant general IT controls. We tested the mitigating manual controls for the IT control deficiencies noted around privilege access for certain scoped-in IT systems and the associated infrastructure. Information Other than the Financial Statements and Auditor's Report Thereon The Parent's Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Management Discussion and Analysis, Board's Report including Annexures to Board's Report, Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report and Corporate Governance in Annual Report, but does not include the consolidated financial statements, standalone financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. Annual Report 2022-23Statutory Reports Financial Statements Corporate Overview229 Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information, compare with the financial statements of the subsidiary audited by the other auditor, to the extent it relates to this entity and, in doing so, place reliance on the work of the other auditor and consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained during the course of our audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. Other information so far as it relates to the subsidiary is traced from their financial statements audited by the other auditor. If based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial Statements The Parent's Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation of these consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position, consolidated financial performance including other comprehensive income, consolidated cash flows and consolidated changes in equity of the Group in accordance with the Ind AS and other accounting principles generally accepted in India. The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group are responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Group and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, which have been used for the purpose of preparation of the consolidated financial statements by the Directors of the Parent, as aforesaid. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the respective Management of the companies included in the Group are responsible for assessing the ability of the respective entities to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the respective Board of Directors either intends to liquidate their respective entities or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group are also responsible for overseeing the financial reporting process of the Group.Auditor's Responsibility for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Obtain an understanding of internal financial control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Parent has adequate internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls. Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the management. Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the ability of the Group to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern. Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entity within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the financial statements of such entity included GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals Limited230 in the consolidated financial statements of which we are the independent auditors. For the other entity included in the consolidated financial statements, which have been audited by the other auditor, such other auditor remains responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audits carried out by them. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the consolidated financial statements that, individually or in aggregate, makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable user of the consolidated financial statements may be influenced. We consider quantitative materiality and qualitative factors in (i) planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work; and (ii) to evaluate the effect of any identified misstatements in the consolidated financial statements. We communicate with those charged with governance of the Parent regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication Other Matters We did not audit the financial statements of a subsidiary, whose financial statements reflect total assets of ` 42,89.79 lakhs as at March 31, 2023, total revenues of ` 51,31.47 lakhs and net cash outflows amounting to ` 19.82 lakhs for the year ended on that date, as considered in the consolidated financial statements.

Auditor's Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements of the Parent and its subsidiary company which is a company incorporated in India, based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the \"Guidance Note\") issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India and the Standards on Auditing, prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements was established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.

The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and the audit evidence obtained by the other auditor of the subsidiary company, which is a company incorporated in India, in terms of their report referred to in the Other Matters paragraph below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements of the Parent and its subsidiary company, which is a company incorporated in India. Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with reference to consolidated financial statements A company's internal financial control with reference to consolidated financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal financial control with reference to consolidated financial statements includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance Annual Report 2022-23Statutory Reports Financial Statements Corporate Overview233 regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with reference to consolidated financial statements Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control with reference to consolidated financial statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Nadkarni Company Secretary FCS 10460 Mumbai, May 17, 2023 Mumbai, May 17, 2023Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2023 Annual Report 2022-23Statutory Reports Financial Statements Corporate Overview239 Note 1: Significant accounting policies A. GENERAL INFORMATION GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals Limited ('the Group') is a public company domiciled in India and is incorporated under the provisions of the Companies Act applicable in India. Its shares are listed on the BSE Ltd. (Bombay Stock Exchange) and the National Stock Exchange of India Ltd. (NSE). The registered office of the company is located at Dr. Annie Besant Road, Worli, Mumbai 400 030. The Group is engaged inter alia, in the business of manufacturing, distributing and trading in pharmaceuticals. The subsidiary considered in these Consolidated Financial Statements is: Name of the CompanyCountry of Incorporation % voting power held as at March 31, 2023 % voting power held as at March 31, 2022 Biddle Sawyer Limited (BSL) India 100.00 100.00 B. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES a) Statement of Compliance The Consolidated Financial Statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards (\"Ind AS\") notified under the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 and relevant provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 (\"the Act\") (as amended from time to time). b) Basis of preparation The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for the following: certain financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value; assets held for sale - measured at lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell; defined benefit plans - plan assets measured at fair value; and share-based payments. The financial statements are presented in INR and all values are rounded to the nearest lakhs (INR 00,000), except where otherwise indicated. c) Operating cycle The operating cycle of the Group is the time between the acquisition of assets for processing and their realisation in cash or cash equivalents. When the Group's normal operating cycle is not clearly identifiable, it is assumed to be twelve months. d) Principles of consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statement have been prepared on the following basis: The Group combines the financial statements of the parent and its subsidiary line by line adding together like items of assets, liabilities, equity, income and expenses. Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between group companies are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the transferred asset. Accounting policies of subsidiary have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the group. The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared using uniform accounting policies for like transactions and other events in similar circumstances and are presented to the extent possible, in the same manner as the Company's separate financial statements. The excess of cost to the Company of its investment in the subsidiary is recognised in the financial statements as goodwill, which has been amortised over a period of ten years. If the difference of the aggregate of the consideration transferred, the amount recognised for noncontrolling interests and any previous interest held, over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is a deficit then the said deficit is recognized as a capital reserve.Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2023 GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals Limited240 e) Revenue recognition Revenue towards satisfaction of a performance obligation is measured at the amount of transaction price (net of variable consideration) allocated to that performance obligation. The transaction price of goods sold and services rendered is net of variable consideration on account of various discounts and schemes offered by the Group as part of the contract. This variable consideration is estimated based on the expected value of outflow. Revenue (net of variable consideration) is recognized only to the extent that it is highly probable that the amount will not be subject to significant reversal when uncertainty relating to its recognition is resolved. The specific recognition criteria described below must also be met before revenue is recognised. Sale of goods Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the goods have been passed on to the buyer as per contractual terms, at which time all the following conditions are satisfied: the Group is recognizing revenue as and when it satisfies the performance obligation by transferring promised goods or services to a customer and customer obtains control of the same.; the Group retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with ownership nor effective control over the goods sold; the amount of revenue can be measured reliably; it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Group; the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably. Rendering of services Income from clinical research and data management services is recognised in the accounting period in which the services are rendered based on terms of the agreement. Rights of return Certain contracts provide a customer with a right to return the goods within a specified period. The Group uses the expected value method to estimate the goods that will not be returned because this method best predicts the amount of variable consideration to which the Group will be entitled. The requirements in Ind AS 115 on constraining estimates of variable consideration are also applied in order to determine the amount of variable consideration that can be included in the transaction price. For goods that are expected to be returned, instead of revenue, the Group recognises a refund liability. T rade Receivables A receivable represents the Group's right to an amount of consideration that is unconditional (i.e., only the passage of time is required before payment of the consideration is due). Refer to accounting policies of financial assets in section (h) Financial instruments. Dividends Dividend is recognised when the Group's right to receive the payment is established, it is probable that economic benefit associated with the dividend will flow to the Group, and the amount of dividend can be measured reliably. Interest Income Interest income is recorded using the Effective Interest Rate (EIR). Interest income is included in other income in the statement of profit and loss. Rental income Rental income arising from operating leases on investment properties is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease terms and is included in revenue in the statement of profit and loss due to its operating nature. f) Property, plant and equipment Freehold land is carried at historical cost. All other items of property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost, net of accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Historical cost includes Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2023 Annual Report 2022-23Statutory Reports Financial Statements Corporate Overview241 expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items. Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of any component accounted for as a separate asset is derecognised when replaced. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the statement of profit and loss during the reporting period in which they are incurred. Depreciation is provided on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as per the rates prescribed under Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013 or re-assessed useful life based on technical evaluation as under: Factory Buildings 30 to 50 years Other Buildings 60 years Plant and Equipment 10 to 15 years Personal Computers and Laptops 3 to 5 years Other Computer Equipment 4 years Furniture and Fixtures 10 years Office Equipment 5 years Vehicles 5 years Depreciation is provided pro-rata for the number of months available for use. Depreciation on sale / disposal of assets is provided pro-rata up to the end of the month of sale / disposal. An asset purchased where the actual cost does not exceed Rs. 5,000 is depreciated at the rate of 100%. Leasehold building, leasehold land and leasehold improvements are amortised over the period of the lease. Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amount. These are recognised as income or expense in the statement of profit and loss. Cost of items of property, plant and equipment not ready for intended use as on the balance sheet date is disclosed as capital work in progress. Advances given towards acquisition of property, plant and equipment outstanding at each balance sheet date are disclosed as Capital advance under Other non-current assets. An item of property, plant and equipment and any significant part initially recognised is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the statement of profit and loss when the asset is derecognised. The residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of property, plant and equipment are reviewed at each financial year end and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate. g) Intangible assets Intangible assets are stated at cost of acquisition net of recoverable taxes less accumulated amortisation / depletion and impairment loss, if any. The cost comprises of purchase price, borrowing costs and any cost directly attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for the intended use. Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amount. These are recognised as income or expense in the statement of profit and loss. Cost of items of intangible assets not ready for intended use as on the balance sheet date are disclosed as intangible assets under development. Amortisation method and periods Amortisation is charged on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives. The estimated useful life and amortisation method are reviewed at the end of each annual reporting period, with the effect of any changes in the estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis. Software expenditure have been amortised over a period from 8 to 10 years. Distribution rights are amortised over the agreement / contract period.Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2023 GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals Limited242 Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in the statement of profit and loss when the asset is derecognised. h) Impairment of non-financial assets Assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset's carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less cost of disposal and value in use. For the purpose of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash inflows which are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or group of assets (cash generating units). Non-financial assets that suffered an impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at the end of each reporting period. Impairment losses of continuing operations, including impairment on inventories, are recognised in the statement of profit and loss, except for properties previously revalued with the revaluation surplus taken to OCI. For such properties, the impairment is recognised in OCI up to the amount of any previous revaluation surplus. i) Leases The Group recognises right of use assets under lease arrangements in which it is the lessee. Rights to use assets owned by third parties under lease agreements are capitalised at the inception of the lease and recognised on the balance sheet. The corresponding liability to the lessor is recognised as a lease obligation. The carrying amount is subsequently increased to reflect interest on the lease liability and reduced by lease payments made. For calculating the discounted lease liability, the lessee's incremental borrowing rate is used. The incremental borrowing rate is calculated at the rate of interest at which the Group would have been able to borrow for a similar term and with a similar security the funds necessary to obtain a similar asset in a similar market. Finance costs are charged to the income statement so as to produce a constant periodic rate of charge on the remaining balance of the obligations for each accounting period. Variable rents are not part of the lease liability and the right of use asset. These payments are charged to the income statement as incurred. If modifications or reassessments occur, the lease liability and right of use asset are re-measured. Right of use assets are depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the lease term. j) Financial instruments A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity. Financial assets (i) Classification The Group classifies its financial assets in the following measurement categories: - those to be measured subsequently at fair value (either through other comprehensive income, or through profit or loss), and - those measured at amortised cost. The classification depends on the Group's business model for managing financial assets and the contractual terms of the cash flows. For assets measured at fair value, gains and losses will either be recorded in the statement of profit and loss or other comprehensive income. For investments in debt instruments, this will depend on the business model in which the investment is held. For investments in equity instruments, this will depend on whether the Group has made an irrevocable election at the time of initial recognition to account for the equity investment at fair value through other comprehensive income. The Group reclassifies debt investments when and only when its business model for managing those assets changes.Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2023 Annual Report 2022-23Statutory Reports Financial Statements Corporate Overview243 (ii) Measurement. At initial recognition, the Group measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. T ransaction costs of financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are expensed in the statement of profit and loss. Financial assets with embedded derivatives are considered in their entirety when determining whether their cash flows are solely payment of principal and interest. Debt instruments Subsequent measurement of debt instruments depends on the Group's business model for managing the asset and the cash flow characteristics of the asset. There are three measurement categories into which the Group classifies its debt instruments: Amortised cost: Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows where those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest are measured at amortised cost. A gain or loss on a debt investment that is subsequently measured at amortised cost and is not part of a hedging relationship is recognised in the statement of profit and loss when the asset is derecognised or impaired. Interest income from these financial assets is included in other income using the effective interest rate method. Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI): Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows and for selling the financial assets, where assets cash flow represents solely payments of principal and interest, are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI). Movements in the carrying amount are taken through OCI, except for the recognition of impairment gains or losses, interest revenue and foreign exchange gains and losses which are recognised in the statement of profit and loss. When the financial asset is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified from equity to profit and loss and recognised in other expenses/ income. Interest income from these financial assets is included in other income using the effective interest rate method. Fair value through profit or loss: Assets that do not meet the criteria for amortised cost or FVOCI are measured at fair value through profit or loss. A gain or loss on a debt investment that is subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss and is not part of a hedging relationship is recognised in the statement of profit and loss and presented net in the statement of profit and loss within other expenses/ income in the period in which it arises. Interest income from these financial assets is included in other income. Equity instruments The Group subsequently measures all equity investments at fair value. Where the Group's management has elected to present fair value gains and losses on equity investments in other comprehensive income, there is no subsequent reclassification of fair value gains and losses to profit and loss. Dividends from such investments are recognised in the statement of profit and loss as other income when the Group's right to receive payments is established. Changes in the fair value of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss statement are recognised in other income/ expense in the statement of profit and loss. Impairment losses (and reversal of impairment losses) on equity investments measured at FVOCI are not reported separately from other changes in fair value. (iii) Impairment of financial assets The Group assesses on a forward looking basis the expected credit losses associated with its assets carried at amortised cost and FVOCI debt instruments. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk. For trade receivables only, the Group applies the simplified approach permitted by Ind AS 109 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2023 GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals Limited244 \"Financial Instruments\", which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised from initial recognition of the receivables. (iv) Derecognition of financial assets A financial asset is derecognised only when the Group has transferred the rights to receive cash flows from the financial asset or retains the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the financial asset, but assumes a contractual obligation to pay the cash flows to one or more recipients. Where the entity has transferred an asset, the Group evaluates whether it has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset. In such cases, the financial asset is derecognised. Where the entity has not transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset, the financial asset is not derecognised. Where the entity has neither transferred a financial asset nor retains substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset, the financial asset is derecognised if the Group has not retained control of the financial asset. Where the Group retains control of the financial asset, the asset is continued to be recognised to the extent of continuing involvement in the financial asset. Financial liabilities and equity instruments Classification as debt or equity Debt and equity instruments issued by the Group are classified as either financial liability or as equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangements and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument. Equity instruments An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Group is recognised at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Repurchase of the Group's own equity instruments is recognised and deducted directly in equity. No gain or loss is recognised in the statement of profit and loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Group's own equity instruments. Financial liabilities All financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Financial liabilities subsequently measured at amortised cost Financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, loans and borrowings, payables, as appropriate. Financial liabilities that are not held-for-trading and are not designated as at fair value through profit or loss are measured at amortised cost at the end of the subsequent accounting period. The carrying amount of financial liabilities that are subsequently measured at amortised cost are determined based on the effective interest method. Interest expense that is not capitalised as part of costs of an asset is included in the \"Finance costs\" line item. The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through the expected life of the financial liability, or, where appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount in initial recognition. Derecognition A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the statement of profit and loss.Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2023 Annual Report 2022-23Statutory Reports Financial Statements Corporate Overview245 Offsetting of financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the consolidated balance sheet if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously. k) Contributed equity Equity shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. l) Inventories Inventories are valued at lower of cost or net realisable value. Cost is determined on weighted average cost basis. The cost of work-in-progress (other than those lying at third party manufacturing sites which is valued at material cost) and finished goods comprises of raw materials, direct labour, other direct costs and related production overheads, but excludes interest expense. Net realisable value is the estimate of the selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the costs of completion and selling expenses. m) Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalent in the balance sheet comprise cash at banks and on hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less, which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. For the purpose of presentation in the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents includes cash on hand, demand deposits with banks, short-term balances (with an original maturity of three months or less from date of acquisition). n) Foreign currency transactions Items included in the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Group are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates ('the functional currency'). The Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in Indian Rupee (INR), which is Group's functional and presentation currency. Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at year end exchange rates are generally recognised in the statement of profit and loss. Foreign exchange gains and losses are presented in the statement of profit and loss on a net basis within other expenses/ income. Non-monetary items that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was determined. T ranslation differences on assets and liabilities carried at fair value are reported as part of the fair value gain or loss. For example, translation differences on non-monetary assets and liabilities such as equity instruments held at fair value through profit or loss are recognised in the statement of profit and loss as part of the fair value gain or loss and translation differences on non-monetary assets such as equity investments classified as FVOCI are recognised in other comprehensive income. Non-monetary items that are measured based on historical cost in a foreign currency are not translated. o) T axes Income tax expense represents the sum of the current tax and deferred tax. Current tax charge is based on taxable profit for the year. T axable profit differs from profit as reported in the statement of profit and loss because some items of income or expense are taxable or deductible in different years or may never be taxable or deductible. The Group's liability for current tax is calculated using Indian tax rates and laws that have been enacted by the reporting date. Current tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority. The Group periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate.Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2023 GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals Limited246 Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable in the future arising from temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the Balance Sheet and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. It is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are off-set against each other and the resultant net amount is presented in the Balance Sheet, if and only when the Group currently has a legally enforceable right to set-off the current income tax assets and liabilities. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. Current and deferred tax is recognised in the statement of profit and loss, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively. p) Employee benefits (a) Short T erm Employee Benefits Short-term employee benefits are expensed as the related service is provided. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably. (b) Post-Employment Benefits (i) Defined Contribution Plans The Group's defined contribution plans are superannuation and employees' pension scheme (under the provisions of the Employees' Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952) since the Group has no further obligation beyond making the contributions. The Group's contributions to these plans are charged to the statement of profit and loss as incurred. (ii) Defined Benefits Plans \"Liability for defined benefit plans is provided on the basis of valuations, as at the balance sheet date, carried out by an independent actuary.\" Gratuity and Post-Retirement Medical The actuarial valuation method used for measuring the liability for gratuity and post-retirement medical is projected unit credit method. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the statement of other comprehensive income in the period of occurrence of such gains and losses. The obligations for gratuity and post-retirement medical are measured as the present value of estimated future cashflows discounted at rates reflecting the prevailing market yields of Indian Government securities as at the balance sheet date for the estimated term of the obligations. The estimate of future salary increases considered takes into account the inflation, seniority, promotion and other relevant factors. The expected rate of return of plan assets is the Group's expectation of the average long term rate of return expected on investments of the fund during the estimated term of the obligations. Plan assets are measured at fair value as at the balance sheet date.Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2023 Annual Report 2022-23Statutory Reports Financial Statements Corporate Overview247 Provident Fund Provident fund contributions are made to a T rust administered by the Group. The Group has an obligation to make good the shortfall, if any, between the return from the investments of the T rust and the notified interest rate. The actuarial valuation method, carried out by an independent actuary, used for measuring the liability for provident fund is projected accrued benefit method. This approach determines the present value of the interest rate guarantee under three interest rate scenarios: base case scenario, rising interest rate scenario and falling interest rate scenario. The defined benefit obligation of the interest rate guarantee is set equal to the average of the present values determined under these scenarios in respect of accumulated provident fund contributions as at the valuation date. (c) Other Long T erm Benefit Plans The liabilities for earned leave and sick leave are not expected to be settled wholly within 12 months after the end of the period in which the employees render the related service. They are therefore measured as the present value of expected future payments to be made in respect of services provided by employees up to the end of the reporting period using the projected unit credit method. The benefits are discounted using the market yields at the end of the reporting period that have terms approximating to the terms of the related obligation. Re-measurements as a result of experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in the statement of profit and loss. (d) The expenditure on voluntary retirement schemes is charged to the statement of profit and loss in the year in which it is incurred. (e) Share Based Payment Arrangements In terms of a long-term incentive plan, the eligible members of the senior management are entitled to receive cash settled awards at the end of a three year 'restricted period', provided they remain in continuous employment with the Company for the aforesaid period. The value of such incentive is based on the price of shares of GlaxoSmithKline Plc, U.K. The above scheme is applicable for all grants to employees till 2022. Starting 2023, Incentives in the form of shares are provided to employees under share award schemes. The fair values of these awards are calculated at their grant dates using a Black-Scholes option pricing model and charged to the income statement with a corresponding credit to ESOP Reserve over the relevant vesting periods. Recharge by the Group Company is accounted with a corresponding debit to ESOP Reserve. q) Investment property Property that is held for long-term rental yields or for capital appreciation or both, and that is not occupied by the Group, is classified as investment property. Investment property is measured initially at its cost, including related transaction costs and where applicable borrowing costs. Subsequent expenditure is capitalised to the assets carrying amount only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the expenditure will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance costs are expensed when incurred. When part of an investment property is replaced, the carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised. Based on technical evaluation the following is the best estimate of period over which investment property is depreciated on a straight-line basis. Asset Management estimate of useful life Factory Building 30 Years Freehold Land - Any gain or loss on disposal of an investment property is recognised in s tatement of profit and loss. r) Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the period attributable to the owners of Group by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the period. The weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the period and for all periods presented is adjusted for events, such as bonus shares, other than the conversion of potential equity shares, that have changed the number of equity shares outstanding, without a corresponding change in resources. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2023 GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals Limited248 For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, the profit for the period attributable to the owners of the Group and the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period is adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential equity shares. s) Exceptional items When items of income or expense are of such nature, size or incidence that their disclosure is necessary to explain the performance of the Group for the year, the Group makes a disclosure of the nature and amount of such items separately under the head \"Exceptional items\". t) Segment reporting Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM). The Managing Director of the Group has been identified as CODM and he is responsible for allocating the resources, assess the financial performance and position of the Group and makes strategic decisions. The Group has identified one reportable segment \"Pharmaceuticals\" based on the information reviewed by the CODM. Refer note 52 for segment information presented. u) Provision and contingent liabilities A provision is recognised if as a result of a past event, the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) that can be estimated reliably and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are recognised at the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date. If the effect of time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. The increase in the provision due to passage of time is recognised as an interest expense. A contingent liability exists when there is a possible but not probable obligation, or a present obligation that may, but probably will not, require an outflow of resources, or a present obligation whose amount cannot be estimated reliably. Contingent liabilities do not warrant provisions but are disclosed unless the possibility of outflow of resources is remote. v) Discontinued operations and non-current assets held for sale Discontinued operation is a component of the Company that has been disposed of or classified as held for sale and represents a major line of business. Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount is intended to be recovered principally through a sale (rather than through continuing use) when the asset (or disposal group) is available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sale of such asset (or disposal group) and the sale is highly probable and is expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification. Non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale are measured at lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. w) Business Combination Common control business combination is accounted using the pooling of interest method where the Company is transferee. Assets and liabilities of the combining entities are reflected at their carrying amounts and no new asset or liability is recognised. Identity of reserves of the transferor company is preserved by reflecting them in the same form in the Company's financial statements in which they appeared in the financial statement of the transferor company. The excess between the amount of consideration paid over the share capital of the transferor company is recognised as a negative amount and the same is disclosed as capital reserve on business combination. The financial information in the financial statements in respect of prior periods is restated from the beginning of the preceding period in the financial statements if the business combination date is prior to that date. However, if business combination date is after that date, the financial information in the financial statements is restated from the date of business combination. Standards issued but not yet effective Ministry of Corporate Affairs (\"MCA\") notifies new standard or amendments to the existing standards. There is no such notification which would have been applicable to the Company from April 1, 2023.Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2023 Annual Report 2022-23Statutory Reports Financial Statements Corporate Overview249 Note 2 : Critical estimates and judgements The preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements requires the use of accounting estimates which, by definition, will seldom equal the actual results. Management also needs to exercise judgement in applying the Group's accounting policies. This note provides an overview of the areas that involved a higher degree of judgement or complexity, and of items which are more likely to be materially adjusted due to estimates and assumptions turning out to be different than those originally assessed. a Recognition and measurement of defined benefit obligations The obligation arising from defined benefit plan is determined on the basis of actuarial assumptions. Key actuarial assumptions include discount rate, trends in salary escalation and vested future benefits and life expectancy. The discount rate is determined by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on government bonds. The period to maturity of the underlying bonds correspond to the probable maturity of the post-employment benefit obligations. b Estimation of useful life Useful lives of tangible assets and intangible assets are based on the estimate by the management. The useful lives as estimated are same as prescribed in Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013. In cases, where the useful lives are different from that prescribed in Schedule II, they are based on management estimate, taking into account the nature of the asset, the estimated usage of the asset, the operating conditions of the asset, past history of replacement, anticipated technological changes, manufacturers' warranties and maintenance support. Assumptions also need to be made, when the Group assesses, whether an asset may be capitalized and which components of the cost of the asset may be capitalised. The useful lives and residual values of Group's assets are determined by management at the time the asset is acquired and reviewed annually for appropriateness. The lives are based on historical experience with similar assets as well as anticipation of future events which may impact their life such as changes in technology. c Provisions and contingent liabilities The Group exercises judgement in measuring and recognising provisions and the exposures to contingent liabilities related to pending litigation or other outstanding claims subject to negotiated settlement, mediation, arbitration or government regulation, as well as other contingent liabilities. Judgement is necessary in assessing the likelihood that a pending claim will succeed, or a liability will arise, and to quantify the possible range of the financial settlement. Because of the inherent uncertainty in this evaluation process, actual losses may be different from the originally estimated provision. d Impairment of assets The Group reviews the carrying amounts of its property, plant and equipment, Capital work in progress and intangible assets, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Further details on the Group's accounting policies on this are set out in the accounting policy above. Determining whether an asset is impaired requires an estimation of the recoverable amount, which requires Group to estimate the Fair value less cost of disposal.

These comprise of three vacant land sites (March 31, 2022: three vacant land sites) that are not in operational use at present. In the view of the management, the fair market value of the land sites is not reliably measurable as there are very few recent transactions of comparable composition of these properties in the market. Further, the fair market value will be subject to numerous municipal deductions dependent upon the current use and intended use of the property. Based on the above, it is not possible to ascertain and disclose the range of fair market value. The estimated Ready Reckoner value at year end, based on latest published data and on current stated use, totals `239,39.48 lakhs (March 31, 2022: `250,70.88 lakhs). Ready Reckoner rates are the prices of residential property, land or commercial property for a given area that is published and regulated by the respective State Governments as a guide towards payment of stamp duty at the time of transaction. The Ready Reckoner Value is regarded as a gross value and does not represent the underlying fair market value of the properties. The Group will further detail the fair value of its investment properties upon entering a committed agreement with a third party, unless an alternative reliable estimate of the fair value is attainable.Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2023 Annual Report 2022-23Statutory Reports Financial Statements Corporate Overview253 Note 5 : Intangible assets (` in lakhs) Gross Carrying Value Accumulated Depreciation Net Carrying Value As at April 1, 2022Additions Disposals As at March 31, 2023As at April 1, 2022Charge for the Ye a rAs at March 31, 2023As at March 31, 2023 Intangible Assets Computer lakhs) Gross Carrying Value Accumulated Depreciation Net Carrying Value As at April 1, 2021Additions Disposals As at March 31, 2022As at April 1, 2021Charge for the Ye a rAs at March 31, 2022As at March 31, 2022 financial assets -

In practice, generally it does not occur. When one variable is changed, it affects others. In calculating the sensitivity, project unit credit method at the end of the reporting period has been applied.

Note 41 : Pricing Matters The demand of ` 71,79.00 lakhs made by the Central Government on the Parent Company in respect of Betamethasone bulk drugs and formulations made therefrom during the period May 1981 to August 1987 has been under litigation for a period spanning over 30 years. Pursuant to the special leave petition of the Central Government in the Supreme Court of India against the Delhi High Court's Judgment and Order dated October 19, 2001 which was held in favour of the Parent Company, the Supreme Court has, vide its Judgement and Order dated March 31, 2011, upheld the demand. The Parent Company had accrued a liability of ` 18,68.00 lakhs in earlier years and a further provision of ` 53,11.00 lakhs was accrued in 2011. Based on legal advice, the Parent Company has filed an application in the Supreme Court seeking, inter alia, clarifications on some aspects of the Judgement and directions for recomputation of the demand. Simultaneously, the Parent Company without prejudice to and subject to the outcome of the application filed in the Supreme Court, has tendered as a further deposit, an amount of ` 63,60.00 lakhs, which together with the amount of ` 8,19.00 lakhs previously deposited with the Government, aggregates the demand of ` 71,79.00 lakhs made by the Government in November 1990. The Parent Company filed a review petition in the Supreme Court which was rejected in March 2012. In October 1996, the Government had claimed interest of ` 117,66.00 lakhs for the period May 12, 1981 to October 17, 1996, for which no provision was made in earlier years. The Government had vide letter dated May 4, 2011 called upon the Parent Company to discharge the entire liability, including upto date interest calculated at 15% p.a., and had vide letter dated October 10, 2011, raised a demand on the Parent Company for the interest amount amounting to ` 247,44.00 lakhs. Without prejudice to the position that interest is not payable, the Parent Company had recognized a provision of ` 247,44.00 lakhs in respect of the Government's claim for interest in 2011. The Parent Company had filed a writ petition at Delhi High Court against the above demand which had been admitted. The Parent Company also filed stay applications which were dismissed and the Parent Company had filed a Special Leave Petition (SLP) before the Supreme Court for stay of the interest demand until final determination of the writ petition filed in the Delhi High Court. The Supreme Court on hearing the above SLP, passed an order on April 3, 2012. The said order stayed the Demand Notice dated October 10, 2011 during the pendency of the writ petition at the Delhi High Court subject to the Parent Company depositing ` 136,82.00 lakhs in three equal installments within six month's time from the date of order. All three instalments have been deposited with the Government. The Supreme Court, vide its order dated October 5, 2012, directed the Delhi High Court to dispose of the writ petition as expeditiously as possible. The Parent Company's counsel has been routinely appearing in the matter and urging the Delhi High Court to hear the matter expeditiously considering it is at final hearing stage and has been pending for a long time. The counsel has also cited the significant sums involved; however, the Court is not inclined to take this matter out of turn. Next date of the matter is July 21, 2023. Note 42 : Matters in respect of erstwhile Burroughs Wellcome (India) Limited (BWIL): (i) The Government of India, Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilisers, New Delhi, passed a final order on July 21, 1993, directing erstwhile BWIL to pay an amount of ` 1,91.15 lakhs along with interest due thereon from the date of default into the Drugs Prices Equalisation Account (DPEA) in respect of a bulk drug procured by erstwhile BWIL during the period April 1981 to April 1983.Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2023 Annual Report 2022-23Statutory Reports Financial Statements Corporate Overview273 Erstwhile BWIL filed a writ petition in August 1993 which was admitted by the Bombay High Court. After hearing both the parties, the High Court granted an interim injunction restraining the Government of India from taking any action in furtherance of and/ or implementation of the order dated July 21, 1993 or from in any manner seeking to compel erstwhile BWIL to deposit any amount into the DPEA, pending the hearing and final disposal of the petition on the condition that erstwhile BWIL furnishes a bank guarantee for ` 2,00.00 lakhs from a nationalised bank and undertakes to pay the amount demanded with interest at the rate of 20% per annum in case the petition fails. Erstwhile BWIL had accordingly furnished the required bank guarantee. If calculated on the basis of correct data, taking into account set offs claimable for earlier years for which data has been provided by erstwhile BWIL, no amount will be payable by the Company and accordingly no provision in that respect is considered necessary. The Company's stand that the demand is not sustainable has been confirmed by an eminent counsel. The Government of India's application in the Supreme Court praying that the writ petition be transferred to the Supreme Court from the Bombay High Court was not allowed and the Company's writ petition is pending hearing by the Bombay High Court. (ii) Erstwhile BWIL had made an application to the Government of India for approval under Section 198(4) of the Companies Act, 1956, in respect of payment to the Managing Director and three whole time Directors amounting to ` 10.93 lakhs for the year ended August 31, 1986, which was in accordance with the minimum remuneration provided in the agreements entered into with them prior to erstwhile BWIL becoming public, which required such Government of India's sanction. The approval is still awaited. Note 43 : Drugs Price Equalization-Biddle Sawyer Biddle Sawyer Limited (BSL) received a letter dated 20th/24th August, 1998 from the Central Government demanding an amount of ` 4,40.80 lakhs comprising ` 1,42.74 lakhs in respect of prices relating to Salbutamol formulations during the period April, 1979 to December, 1983 with interest thereon amounting to ` 2,98.06 lakhs upto 31st July, 1998. BSL had been legally advised that the demand of ` 1,42.74 lakhs is not sustainable and it, therefore follows that the interest demand also cannot be sustained. The total demand has been challenged by BSL in a Writ Petition filed in the Bombay High Court. The Bombay High Court has granted an interim stay of the demand, subject to BSL depositing 50% of the principal amount. Accordingly, BSL has deposited an amount of ` 71.50 lakhs with the Government on 3rd May, 1999. This is a normal interim order passed by the High court in such matters and does not in any way reflect upon the merits or otherwise of the case. The amount will be refunded if BSL succeeds at the final hearing of the matter. The Government's application in the Supreme Court praying that this writ petition be transferred to the Supreme Court from the Bombay High Court was not allowed and BSL's writ petition will now be heard by the Bombay High Court. Note 44 : Matters in respect of erstwhile SmithKline Beecham (India) Limited: (i) ` 1,44.44 lakhs received from Beckman Instruments International S.A. on account of disputed alleged additional commission has been included under non-current provisions and Income tax paid thereon aggregating ` 64.77 lakhs has been included under other non-current assets. The Company is contesting the matter with the concerned authorities. (ii) Refund of surtax ` 96.81 lakhs, and interest thereon amounting to ` 48.52 lakhs, received during 1994, have not been adjusted against the provision for tax in the books of accounts and recognised as income respectively, since the Income tax department had filed a reference application against the income tax tribunal's order which was pending before the High Court of Karnataka. The Company has received an order dated April 18, 2007 from the High Court of Karnataka which is partially in the Company's favour. On the basis of the aforesaid order, Income T ax Appellate T ribunal (ITAT), Bangalore will pass an order giving directions. On receipt of the ITAT order, the Company will take appropriate steps in the matter.

Fair Value Hierarchy This section explains the judgements and estimates made in determining the fair values of the financial instruments that are (a) recognised and measured at fair value and (b) measured at amortised cost and for which fair values are disclosed in the Consolidated Financial Statements. (a) Financial instruments that are recognised and measured at fair value T o provide an indication about the reliability of the inputs used in determining fair value, the Group has classified its financial instruments into the three levels prescribed under the accounting standard. Level 1 : It includes financial instruments measured using quoted prices. Level 2 : The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined using valuation techniques which maximise the use of observable market data and rely as little as possible on entity-specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2. Level 3 : Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable.

Financial risk management The Group has exposure to the following risks arising from financial instruments: Credit risk ; Liquidity risk ; and Market risk Risk management framework GlaxoSmithKline's board of directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group's risk management framework. The board of directors has established the Risk Management Committee, which is responsible for developing and monitoring the Group's risk management policies. The committee reports regularly to the board of directors on its activities. The Group's risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Group's activities. The Group, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to maintain a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations. The audit committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Group's risk management policies and procedures, and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group. The audit committee is assisted in its oversight role by internal audit. Internal audit undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the audit committee. Credit Risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Group's receivables from customers. T rade and other receivables The Group's trade receivables are largely from sales made to wholesale customers and direct sales to hospitals with a smaller proportion of sales to Indian Government Institutions. The Group's exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer, demographics of the customer and the default risk of the industry. The Group manages credit risk through credit approvals, establishing credit limits and continuously monitoring the creditworthiness of customers to which the Group grants credit terms in the normal course of business. Exposures to customers outstanding at the end of each reporting period are reviewed to determine incurred and expected credit losses and the Group establishes an allowance for doubtful debts and impairment that represents its estimate of expected losses in respect of trade receivables. Historical trends of impairment of trade receivables do not reflect any significant credit losses. Given that the macro economic indicators have undergone change, it has not affected the customers of the Group substantially, hence the Group expects the historical trend of minimal credit losses to continue. The impairment loss as at March 31, 2023 relates to customers that have defaulted on their payments to the Group and are not expected to be able to pay their outstanding balances, mainly due to economic circumstances. In case of receivables from wholesale customers and hospitals, the Group has followed a provision approach consistent with expected credit loss approach as per IndAS 109.Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2023 Annual Report 2022-23Statutory Reports Financial Statements Corporate Overview283 Summary of the Group's ageing of outstanding from various customers and impairment for expected Credit Loss is as follows: (` in lakhs) As at March 31, 2023 Gross Carrying amountExpected Credit LossesCarrying amount of trade receivables (net of Expected Credit loss) Not due 178,10.70 3.91 178,06.79 Past due days otal 205,24.30 12,86.80 at March 31, 2022 Gross Carrying amountExpected Credit LossesCarrying amount of trade receivables (net of Expected Credit loss) Not due 191,81.13 6.39 191,74.74 Past due 731-1095 days 4,69.21 T otal 225,47 .13 20,23.24 205,23.89 Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they become due. The Group manages its liquidity risk by ensuring, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risk to the Group's reputation. The Group's principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents and the cash flow that is generated from operations. The Group has no outstanding bank borrowings. The Group believes that the working capital is sufficient to meet its current requirements. Any short-term surplus cash generated, over and above the amount required for working capital management and other operational requirements, are retained as Cash and Investment in short term deposits with banks and mutual funds. The said investments are made in instruments with appropriate maturities and sufficient liquidity. As of March 31, 2023, the Group had working capital of ` 1167,89.44 lakhs, including cash and cash equivalents of ` 34,94.09 lakhs, investments in term deposits (i.e., bank certificates of deposit having original maturities of more than 3 months but less than 12 months) of ` 1100,89.00 lakhs and Current investments of ` 518,28.88 lakhs. As of March 31, 2022, the Group had working capital of ` 2009,60.35 lakhs, including cash and cash equivalents of ` 286,18.71 lakhs, investments in term deposits (i.e., bank certificates of deposit having original maturities of more than 3 months but less than 12 months) of ` 2179,10.00 lakhs and Current investments of ` 365,59.23 lakhs.Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2023 GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals Limited284 Exposure to liquidity risk The following are the remaining contractual maturities of financial liabilities at the reporting date.

Market risk is attributable to all market risk-sensitive financial instruments, all foreign currency receivables and payables. The Group is exposed to market risk primarily related to foreign exchange rate risk and risk on its investments. However since the investments are in overnight and liquid funds the risk is negligible. Currency risk The fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates may have potential impact on the statement of profit and loss, where any transaction references more than one currency or where assets/liabilities are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity. The Group is exposed to currency risk on account of its receivables and payables in foreign currency. The functional currency of the Group is Indian Rupee. The Group has exposure to GBP, USD, EUR and other currencies. The Group has not hedged this foreign currency exposure and strives to achieve asset liability offset of foreign currency exposure.Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2023 Annual Report 2022-23Statutory Reports Financial Statements Corporate Overview285 Exposure to currency risk The Group's exposure to foreign currency risk at the end of the reporting period is as follows: (` in lakhs) Nature of Loss As at March 31, 2023 As at March 31, 2022 GBP USD EUR Others GBP USD EUR Others Current Financial assets 122,51.66 - - - 58,80.52 - (6.03) - - - (6.03) (2.71) - Net statement of financial position exposure105,64.96 (36,05.30) (1,62.50) (3,37 .43) 42,19.84 (80,53.11) (2,20.97) - Sensitivity analysis A reasonably possible strenghtening / weakening of the respective foreign currencies with respect to functional currency of Group would result in increase or decrease in profit or loss and equity as shown in table below.

('Plc'). Under these plans, certain employees are granted cash / equity settled RSAs at no cost, which entitle them to receive cash equivalent to the stock price of the Plc's shares or shares of the Plc's listed at London stock exchange after two and a half to three year vesting period during which the employee has to remain in continuous employment with the Group. These RSA's do not give any voting rights or the right to accrue dividends and there are no performance criteria attached. The fair value of these awards is determined based on the closing share price on the day of grant, after deducting the expected future dividend yield of 3.75% (Previous Year 3.8%) over the duration of the award.

The performance conditions since 2022 are based on five measures over a three-year performance period. These are TSR (30%), pipeline progress (20%), profit measure (20%), sale measure (20%) and ESG environment (10%).
