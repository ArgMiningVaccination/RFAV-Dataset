Defra Publications, Admail 6000 London, SW1A 2XX\u00a9 Crown Copyright March 2003 PB 7949Code of Recommendations for the Welfare of Livestock: CattleNote After consultation, this code (which consists of paragraphs 1-150) has been put before both Housesof Parliament for authority to issue it under Section 3of the Agriculture (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1968. This Section allows 'the Ministers' to produce codes of recommendations for the welfare of livestock, andto issue such codes once they have been approved indraft by both Houses of Parliament. However, theoriginal definition of 'the Ministers' (see Section 50 ofthe 1968 Act) has been changed to reflect devolutionfor Scotland and Wales and the creation of theDepartment for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.In England, the powers of 'the Ministers' were firsttransferred to the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheriesand Food by the Transfer of Functions (Agricultureand Food) Order 1999 (S.I. 1999/3141) and thentransferred to the Secretary of State by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Dissolution) Order2002 (S.I. 2002/794). In Scotland, the powers of 'the Ministers' had previously been transferred to the Scottish Ministersby Section 53 of the Scotland Act 1998 (1998 c.46)and, in Wales, the powers of 'the Ministers' hadpreviously been transferred to the National Assemblyfor Wales by article 2(a) of the National Assembly for Wales (Transfer of Functions) Order 1999 (S.I. 1999/672).

Any person who keeps animals, or who causes or knowingly permits animals to be kept, shall notattend to them unless he has access to all relevantstatutory welfare codes relating to the animalswhile he is attending to them, and is acquaintedwith the provisions of those codes. In Regulation 2 it states that 'statutory welfare code' means code for the time being issued under Section 3 of the Agriculture (MiscellaneousProvisions) Act 1968. To cause unnecessary pain or unnecessary distress to any livestock on agricultural land is an offence underSection 1(1) of the Agriculture (MiscellaneousProvisions) Act 1968. The breach of a code provision,whilst not an offence in itself, can nevertheless be used in evidence as tending to establish the guilt ofanyone accused of causing unnecessary pain ordistress under the Act (Section 3(4)). The Welfare of Farmed Animals (England) Regulations 2000 (S.I. 2000 No. 1870) Regulation3(1), states that: - owners and keepers of animals shall take all reasonable steps: - to ensure the welfare of the animals under their care; and - to ensure that the animals are not caused any unnecessary pain, suffering or injury. The Welfare of Farmed Animals (England) Regulations 2000 (S.I. 2000 No. 1870) Regulation3(3), states that: In deciding whether the conditions under which animals are kept comply with the requirements setout in Schedule 1 of the Regulations, the ownerand keeper of the animals shall have regard to theirspecies, and to their degree of development,adaptation and domestication, and to theirphysiological and ethological needs in accordancewith established experience and scientificknowledge. 2Preface This preface is not part of the code; instead, it explains the code 's role and the broad considerations on which it is based. The legal text in shaded boxesthroughout this document is not part of the code either but highlights the legalposition. The text in these boxes is the law as it stands on the date that this code is published or reprinted (please turn to the back cover for this information). You should be aware that any of the legal requirements quoted here couldchange - you should check that these are an accurate statement of the law as it currently stands. (See the Appendix for a list of relevant legislation).The Welfare of Farmed Animals (England) Regulations 2000 (S.I. 2000 No. 1870) Regulation11, states that: Where an authorised person considers that animals are being kept in a way which is likely to causeunnecessary pain, suffering or injury, or in any otherway in contravention of any provision of theseRegulations, he may serve a notice on the personappearing to him to be in charge of the animalsrequiring that person, within the period stated inthe notice, to take any action that the authorisedperson considers to be reasonably necessary toensure compliance with these Regulations and theauthorised person shall give his reasons forrequiring that action to be taken. The Welfare of Farmed Animals (England) Regulations 2000 (S.I. 2000 No. 1870) Regulation13(2), states that: In any proceedings against an owner or keeper of animals for a failure to comply with Regulation 3(1)or 3(2), the owner or keeper as the case may be,may rely on his compliance with any relevantrecommendation contained in a statutory welfarecode as tending to establish his compliance withthe relevant regulation. The code aims to encourage all those who care for farm animals to follow the highest standards ofhusbandry. Without good stockmanship, animalwelfare can never be properly protected. If stock-keepers follow this code, it will help them to meet thenecessary welfare standards. No matter howacceptable a system may be in principle, withoutcompetent, diligent stockmanship, the welfare of theanimals cannot be adequately catered for. The welfare of cattle is considered within a framework that was developed by the Farm AnimalWelfare Council and known as the 'Five Freedoms '. These form a logical basis for assessing animal welfarewithin any husbandry system, together with takingthe action necessary to protect animal welfare withinthe limitations of an efficient livestock industry.The Five Freedoms are: 1freedom from hunger and thirst - by ready access to fresh water and a diet to maintain full health and vigour; 2freedom from discomfort - by providing an appropriate environment including shelter and a comfortable resting area; 3 freedom from pain, injury or disease - by prevention or rapid diagnosis and treatment; 4freedom to express normal behaviour - by providing sufficient space, proper facilities and company of the animals ' own kind; 5 freedom from fear and distress - by ensuring conditions and treatment which avoid mental suffering. In taking account of these freedoms, those people who care for livestock should demonstrate: caring and responsible planning and management; skilled, knowledgeable and conscientious stockmanship; appropriate environmental design (for example, of the husbandry system); considerate handling and transport of animals; and humane slaughter.1This code (which only applies in England) covers all cattle. 'Cattle ' refers to all bovine stock (such as cows and oxen), and includes buffalo and bison. A calf refers to any animal under six months old. 2The code 's recommendations apply to cattle under all husbandry systems. Section 1 of the codegives the recommendations that apply to all agesand types of cattle. Section 2 covers thoserecommendations that apply to specific categoriesof cattle (such as calves, breeding cattle and dairy).If these recommendations are followed, they willhelp to protect the stock 's welfare. The code 's recommendations are not a complete list and theyare not meant to replace expert advice, such asfrom a veterinary surgeon. 3The husbandry system that is used, and the number and stocking rate of cattle kept at any one time, should depend on: the suitability of the farm environment; how many animals the farm can accommodate at one time; the competence of the stock-keeper; and how long the stockmen have to carry out their duties. 4Organic cattle farming is conducted according to additional, legally enforced standards. However,nothing in those standards affects the legalresponsibilities of organic farmers regarding positiveanimal welfare. Any matters which appear to conflictwith organic standards should be discussed with yourorganic certifying body. In addition, you should seekexpert advice, such as from a veterinary surgeon. 5In general, the larger the size or the productivity of the herd, the more skill and care is needed to protectwelfare. No changes should be made to husbandry,equipment or production until the possible effects onanimal welfare have been considered. 6 The relevant animal welfare legislation applies to owners as well as to anyone looking after cattle ontheir behalf, wherever the cattle are located. Awritten contract can be useful in making sure thateveryone involved is clear about their animalwelfare responsibilities. However, the obligationsimposed by law will still apply, whether or not acontract exists. Certain aspects of livestockhusbandry can present hazards to the health andsafety of the stock-keeper. Advice on such mattersis available from the local Agricultural SafetyInspector of the Health and Safety Executive. 5Introduction The Protection of Animals Acts 1911-2000 contain the general law relating to cruelty to animals.Broadly it is an offence (under Section 1 of the1911 and 1912 Acts) to be cruel to any domestic or captive animal by anything that is done oromitted to be done. Section 12(2) of the 1911 Act empowers a police constable to place in safe custody, animals in thecharge of persons apprehended for an offenceunder the Act until the end of proceedings or thecourt orders the return of the animals. Thereasonable costs involved, including any necessaryveterinary treatment, are recoverable from theowner upon conviction. Under section 1 of the Protection of Animals (Amendment) Act 1954, as amended by the 1988Act, the court has the power to disqualify a personconvicted under these Acts from having custody ofany animal. The ban can specify a particular kindof animal or all animals for such period as thecourt thinks fit. The Protection of Animals (Amendment) Act 2000 supplements the 1911 Act by allowing a court tomake an order relating to the care, disposal orslaughter of animals kept for commercial purposesthat are the subject of a prosecution brought underthe 1911 Act by a \"prosecutor \". A \"prosecutor \" is defined in the 2000 Act to include certain bodiesthat conduct prosecutions (Crown ProsecutionService, Government departments and localauthorities) and any person or bodies approved bythe Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). The 2000 Act then allowsreasonable costs to be recovered from the owner by the \"prosecutor \". This code only applies in England and has been issued by the Secretary of State for the Environment, Foodand Rural Affairs (following its approval in draft byboth Houses of Parliament). It replaces (also only inEngland) the existing code, which was issued in 1983.Similar codes are being produced in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Until these new codes areissued, the existing code will continue to apply inScotland and Wales. Separate arrangements existin Northern Ireland. THIS WELFARE CODE WAS ISSUED ON 23 APRIL 2003 4Inspection The Welfare of Farmed Animals (England) Regulations 2000 (S.I. 2000 No. 1870) Schedule 1, paragraph 2,requires that: - All animals kept in husbandry systems in which their welfare depends on frequent human attention shallbe thoroughly inspected at least once a day to checkthat they are in a state of well-being; and - Animals kept in systems other than husbandry systems in which their welfare depends on frequenthuman attention shall be inspected at intervalssufficient to avoid any suffering. 11The health and welfare of animals depends on them being regularly inspected. All stock-keepersshould be familiar with the normal behaviour of cattleand should watch for any signs of distress or disease.To do this, it is important that stock-keepers haveenough time to: inspect the stock; check equipment; and take action to deal with any problem. There are more detailed inspection rules for calves (see box before paragraph 99 and paragraphs 99-101). 12 The stock-keeper should be aware of the signs of ill-health in cattle, which include: listlessness, separation from the group; unusual behaviour; loss of body condition; loss of appetite; a sudden fall in milk yield; constipation; scouring (diarrhoea); not cudding; any discharge from the nostrils or eyes; producing more saliva than usual; persistent coughing; rapid or irregular breathing abnormal resting behaviour; swollen joints; lameness; and mastitis. 13 You should be able to anticipate problems or recognise them in their earliest stages. In many cases,you should be able to identify the cause and putmatters right immediately. You should alwaysconsider the possibility that cattle may be affected bya notifiable disease (see paragraphs 37-38). If thecause is not obvious, or if your immediate action isnot effective, a veterinary surgeon or other expertshould be called in immediately - failure to do so may cause unnecessary suffering. Handling The Welfare of Farmed Animals (England) Regulations (S.I. 2000 No. 1870), Schedule 1, Paragraph 30,states that: - No person shall apply an electric current to any animals for the purposes of immobilisation. 14 Cattle should be moved at their own pace, without being hurried by stock-keepers, vehicles ordogs. You should encourage them gently - especiallyaround corners and where it is slippery underfoot.You should avoid using too much noise, excitementor force. You must not put pressure or strike at anyparticularly sensitive part of the body (such as thehead or udder). Anything that you use to guide theanimals (such as a stick) should only be used for thatpurpose and must not have a sharp or pointed end.The use of electric goads on adult cattle should beavoided as far as possible. If goads are used, you 7Section 1 - Recommendations for all cattle The Welfare of Farmed Animals (England) Regulations 2000 (S.I. 2000 No. 1870) define a \"keeper \" as 'any person responsible for or in charge of animalswhether on a permanent or temporary basis. ' The Welfare of Farmed Animals (England) Regulations 2000 (S.I. 2000 No. 1870) Schedule 1, paragraph 1,states that: Animals shall be cared for by a sufficient number of staff who possess the appropriate ability,knowledge and professional competence. General 7 The stock-keeper has the most significant influence on the welfare of cattle. The stock-keeper shoulddraw up a written health and welfare plan with theherd's veterinary surgeon and, where necessary, othertechnical advisors, which should be reviewed andupdated each year. This plan should set out healthand husbandry activities that cover the whole year 's cycle of production, and include strategies to prevent,treat or limit existing disease problems. The planshould include records to enable you to monitor andassess the health and welfare of the herd. 8 Those responsible for farm management should make sure that the cattle are cared for by enoughwell-motivated and competent staff. These staff needto be aware of the welfare needs of cattle and becapable of protecting them from all expectedproblems before they are given any responsibility.This means that the staff need specific knowledgeand skills, which they should develop on-farm byworking with a skilled stock-keeper who isexperienced in the relevant system. Whereverpossible, staff should also go on a course run by asuitable training organisation. Ideally, the trainingshould lead to formal recognition of competence.Any contract or casual labour used on the farm inbusy periods should be trained and competent in therelevant activity.9 Stock-keepers should be knowledgeable and competent in a wide range of animal health andwelfare skills, which should include: handling skills (see paragraphs 14-17); ear tagging (see paragraphs 18-21); preventing and treating certain basic or common cases of lameness (see paragraphs 31-33); preventing and treating internal and external parasites (see paragraphs 34-35); administrating medicines (see paragraph 36); providing appropriate care to sick and injured cattle (see paragraphs 39-48); castration (see paragraph 116); disbudding (see paragraphs 117-119); and removing supernumerary (extra) teats (see paragraph 120); and milking (see paragraph 143-149) It is particularly important that stock-keepers are competent in calving assessments and simpledeliveries, if this is part of their role. If they areexpected to perform specific tasks on-farm, such asfoot trimming, then appropriate training should begiven. Otherwise, a veterinary surgeon or, for certaintasks, a competent and trained contractor will berequired. 10 It is important that grazing cattle, especially young stock come into regular contact with a stock-keeper so that they will not be too frightened if theyneed to be gathered or treated. Careful supervisionand handling of the animals will reduce their fear.The stock-keeper needs a back-up plan andequipment available if he needs to catch and restrainan extensively grazed animal that is not so used tohuman contact (for example, if it needs to see aveterinary surgeon). You should avoid mixing groupsof animals, especially where the animals are horned. 6Section 1 - Recommendations for all cattle Stockmanship[(5) not relevant.] (6) An animal may be loaded or unloaded by means of manual lifting or carrying if the animal is of a sizethat it can easily be lifted by not more than twopersons and the operation is carried out withoutcausing injury or unnecessary suffering to the animal. (7) An animal may be loaded or unloaded without equipment or by manual lifting or carryingprovided that, having regard to the age, height and species of the animal, it is unlikely to be causedinjury or unnecessary suffering by being loaded orunloaded in this manner. 17 You should have the facilities on-farm to load and unload cattle onto and from a vehicle, with as littlestress as possible. Stock-keepers should know how tohandle animals during loading and unloading,including: using visual fields (i.e. cattle have a wide field of vision but have a blind spot behind them, which you should avoid entering) and flight zones (an imaginary area which if you enter will make the animal want to move away. You can control an animal 's movement by understanding the flight zone). lighting (as cattle prefer to move from the dark into the light); and when and how to use such things as sticks and other implements. Marking 18 The law states that all cattle must be permanently identified by an official ear tag in each ear. These eartags should be fitted by a properly trained andcompetent operator, so that the animal does notsuffer any unnecessary pain or distress - either whenthe tags are fitted or later. Think carefully about thebest type of tags for your animals. A suitable style and size of tag should be used for the breed of animal. Make sure that you fit the tagcorrectly by following the manufacturers ' instructions and using the correct applicator for the model of tagyou are fitting. Always fit the tags under hygienicconditions. 19 When fitting ear tags, you must properly restrain the animals. You should take care to position andinsert tags correctly, avoiding main blood vessels andridges of cartilage. When inserted, the tag should beproperly closed to minimise snagging. Remember toleave a suitable gap under the tag and at the edge ofthe ear to allow for growth. If you are tagging cattleduring the fly season (i.e. summer) you should takeprecautions to prevent the animals being irritated byflies. 20 If you are marking the cattle with neck bands or chains, and tail bands or leg bands (which you use forherd management identification purposes) you shouldfit them carefully and adjust them as necessary toavoid causing the animals any unnecessary pain,suffering or injury. If you are using aerosols or paintsfor temporary marking, make sure you only use non-toxic (safe) substances. 21 You can find out more information on cattle identification and cattle movements from the BritishCattle Movement Service (see the Appendix forcontact details). Clipping 22 Anyone who clips cattle should be experienced, competent and trained in clipping techniques.Clipping operators should clean and disinfect theirequipment between cattle to reduce the risk ofspreading disease. The clippers they use shouldalways be appropriate for the purpose and wellmaintained. 9Section 1 - Recommendations for all cattle should always ensure that there is sufficient space for them to move forward. 15 You should regularly assess the type and condition of any track on which cattle are moved andthe distance from housing or milking facilities topasture. Your assessment should include: gateways; tracks; and the areas surrounding water troughs; so that you can take appropriate action to avoid possible injury or lameness. You should make sure that any concrete floors and walkways have a non-slip surface, which does notcause too much pressure or excessive abrasion on theanimals ' feet. 16 All stock-keepers should have access to easy-to- use and efficient handling pens (the right size andscale for the type and number of animals in the herd).This is so that you can routinely manage and treat theanimals, and make sure that they are quietly andfirmly handled. Ideally, these handling pens shouldprotect the animals from extreme weather. Youshould keep all pens, races (narrow passageways),crushes (restraining gates to assist handling) andfloors in good condition and make sure that they arefree from any sharp edges or projections which mightinjure cattle. Where possible races should be gentlycurved rather than have right-angled bends. Transport off-farm The Welfare of Animals (Transport) Order 1997 (S.I. 1997 No. 1480) Schedule 2, Part II, Paragraph 15,states that: - (1) Animals shall not be suspended by mechanical means, nor lifted or dragged by the head, horns, legs or tail.(2) No person shall use excessive force to control animals. (3) Subject to sub-paragraph (4) below, no person shall use - (a) any instrument which is capable of inflicting an electric shock to control any animal; (b) any stick, goad or other instrument or thing to hit or prod any cattle of six months or under. (4) The prohibition in sub-paragraph (3)(a) above shall not apply to the use of any instrument of a kind mentioned in the sub-paragraph, on the hindquarters of any cattle over the age of six months which are refusing to move forward when there is space for them to do so, but the use of any such instrument shall be avoided as far as possible. (5) Nothing in this provision shall prevent the suspension by mechanical means of a receptacle inwhich an animal is being carried. The Welfare of Animals (Transport) Order 1997 (S.I. 1997 No. 1480), Schedule 2, Part II, paragraph 10states that:- (1) Animals shall be loaded and unloaded in accordance with this paragraph. (2) Save as provided in sub-paragraphs (6) and (7) below they shall be loaded and unloaded using suitable ramps, bridges, gangways or mechanical lifting gear, operated so as to prevent injury or unnecessary suffering to any animal. (3) The flooring of any loading equipment shall be constructed so as to prevent slipping. (4) Subject to sub-paragraph (6) below, ramps, bridges, gangways and loading platforms shall be provided on each side with protection which is- (a) of sufficient strength, length and height to prevent any animal using the loading equipment from falling or escaping; and (b) positioned so that it will not result in injury or unnecessary suffering to any animal. 8Section 1 - Recommendations for all cattleBiosecurity 28 Biosecurity means reducing the risk of disease occurring or spreading to other animals.Good biosecurity can be obtained through: good management/husbandry; good hygiene; reducing stress on the herd; effective disease control systems such as vaccination and worming programmes. Biosecurity results in: farm units being more secure from the introduction of new infectious diseases; and the spread of any diseases on the unit itself being kept to a minimum. 29 If you are careful when you move livestock onto a farm, and within the farm (particularly if the farm is on more than one site), this can greatly reduce thechance of a major outbreak of disease. For example,any cattle must only be transported in vehicles that have been properly cleansed and disinfected.You should ask the vendor to provide you withinformation on the health of the herd, such asroutine vaccination and worming procedures, so that their suitability for your herd can be assessedand, where necessary, appropriate treatments andvaccinations administered. 30 You should have isolation facilities so that you can isolate and observe/test new animals for asuitable period when they arrive, before they join therest of the herd. Hired bulls should only be usedwhen no alternative is available. The potentialdisease status of the hired bull should be carefullyconsidered prior to its introduction. Get advice fromyour veterinary surgeon. You can find moreinformation in the Defra publication 'Better biosecurity provides peace of mind, healthy stock anda more viable business ' (see the Appendix).Lameness 31 Lameness in any animal is usually a sign that they are in pain. Lameness in cattle is a sign of ill-healthand discomfort. It clearly affects animals ' welfare, as well as their performance and production. For thisreason, very lame cows should be taken off concreteand housed in a suitably bedded pen. If a significantpercentage of your cattle has severe lameness, thiscan be a sign of poor overall welfare standardswithin the herd. You can find more information inDefra 's booklets, 'Lameness in dairy cattle ' and 'Lameness in beef cattle and dairy followers ' (see the Appendix). 32 If lame cows do not respond to treatment, you need to call a veterinary surgeon immediately.Lameness can have a number of causes. This is whyyou need the veterinary surgeon 's early and accurate diagnosis of the specific type of lameness affectingthe herd before you can identify the likely causes andtake the appropriate action. 33 If a lame animal does not respond to the veterinary surgeon 's treatment, you should have it culled rather than leave it to suffer. If you cannottransport lame animals without causing them morepain, you should slaughter them on the farm (seeparagraph 47). Also, you must not transport anycattle off-farm that cannot stand up unaided orcannot bear their weight on all four legs whenstanding or walking. You should not take any cattlethat can bear weight on all four feet but are slightlylame to market or anywhere else if it is likely toaggravate the injury, however slightly. External parasites 34 You should control diseases caused by external parasites - especially where the animal 's skin is irritated and it is rubbing the area - with theappropriate parasiticides. You should treat youranimals for parasites with your veterinary surgeon 's 11Section 1 - Recommendations for all cattle General 23 Maintenance of good health is the most basic requirement affecting the welfare of cattle.Measures to protect health include good hygiene,good husbandry and effective ventilation.Vaccinations may be appropriate against certaindiseases. You should ensure that only authorisedveterinary medicinal products, including vaccines, are used. 24 The written health and welfare plan (see paragraph 7) should also, as a minimum, look at: biosecurity arrangements on-farm and in transport; purchased stock procedures; any specific disease programmes, such as leptospirosis, Johne 's disease, salmonella, BVD and tuberculosis; vaccination policy and timing; isolation procedures; external and internal parasite control; lungworm control; lameness monitoring and foot care; routine procedures, such as ear tagging; mastitis control. The health and welfare plan should make sure that animals get any necessary medical treatment at thecorrect time and in the correct dose. 25 In geographical areas with known mineral deficiencies and imbalances - and where vitamin ormineral deficiencies are likely - you may need tosupplement the animals ' diet. Supplementary magnesium should be provided during periods whenthere is a recognised risk of deficiency, for example,in early spring or at weaning in suckler herds. Thisaspect should be covered in your health and welfareplan. Equally, too much of a particular vitamin ormineral may cause problems. For example, too muchcopper can lead to copper poisoning. You need to look carefully at the amount of copper in the existingdiet, prior to the administration of copper orally or byinjection. 26 If your herd has a serious problem with summer mastitis, you need advice from a veterinary surgeonabout introducing a suitable control programme.Controls for summer mastitis may include: dry cow therapy; teat sealants; controlling flies (particularly from July to September) by using ear tags impregnated with insecticide or pour-on/spray insecticides; and where possible, avoiding high-risk pastures (such as areas close to hedges and slow moving water which attract flies) (see paragraph 142). Condition scoring 27 Body-condition scoring can contribute greatly to good husbandry and help to avoid costly welfareproblems. Condition scoring is an easy technique to learn. Basically, it means that you can quicklyassess the body reserves (i.e. fat) of individualanimals. The technique will be of benefit if you useit as a routine management tool to check that cattleare in the target condition for each stage of theproduction cycle. This will be particularly useful at: drying off or weaning; calving; peak yield; and early lactation. You should adjust feeding as necessary for animals that are too fat or too thin. You will find moreinformation in the Defra booklets, 'Condition scoring of dairy cows ' and 'Condition scoring of beef suckler cows and heifers ' (see the Appendix). 10Section 1 - Recommendations for all cattle Healthadvice and ensure that control and treatment regimes form part of your herd health and welfareplan. Internal parasites 35 You should control internal parasites by planning the grazing rotation and by using effective medicinalproducts (to control roundworm and fluke) orvaccines (to prevent lungworms). As part of the herdhealth and welfare plan you should ensure thattreatment is based on the life cycle of the particularparasites you are tackling. You should treat youranimals for parasites with your veterinary surgeon 's advice. Organic producers, in particular, should seekveterinary advice on this aspect of their health andwelfare plan. Dosing and vaccination equipment 36 You must make sure that all the equipment you use for dosing, vaccinating and treating the animalsis in good working order. Ideally, use equipmentfrom your own farm. If you must borrow it, makesure it is cleaned and disinfected before use on yourfarm. You should regularly clean and sterilise anyequipment you use for injections, to avoid infectionsand abscesses. Ideally, you should use disposableneedles. The size of a dosing-gun nozzle should besuitable for the animal 's age. You should dispose of any dangerous objects (such as needles) safely.Products should be administered according tomanufacturer 's instructions and you should be trained to give treatments - such as injections orboluses by mouth - as the animals could be injuredby poor administration of treatments. Notifiable diseases 37 If you suspect that any animal is suffering from a notifiable disease, you have a legal duty to notify aDivisional Veterinary Manager (DVM) of Defra as soon as possible. 38 The following are the main notifiable diseases which affect cattle: For more information on these diseases contact your veterinary surgeon or local Animal Health DivisionalOffice. Sick and injured animals The Welfare of Farmed Animals (England) Regulations 2000 (S.I. 2000 No. 1870) Schedule 1,paragraph 5, states that: - any animals which appear to be ill or injured:- shall be cared for appropriately without delay; and- where they do not respond to care, veterinary advice shall be obtained as soon as possible.The Welfare of Farmed Animals (England) Regulations 2000 (S.I. 2000 No. 1870) Schedule 1,paragraph 6, states that: - where necessary, sick or injured animals shall be isolated in suitable accommodation with, whereappropriate, dry comfortable bedding. 39 You should take action immediately if any cattle are injured or appear ill or distressed. It is importantto exclude the possibility of notifiable diseases. Ifyou are in any doubt about the ill-health or the mosteffective treatment, consult your veterinary surgeonwithout delay. Likewise, if an animal you havetreated does not respond to treatment, seek yourveterinary surgeon 's advice. 40 When necessary, you should have a procedure for isolating and caring for sick or injured animals.Hospital pens should be an essential component ofany cattle unit and they should have an entrancethat is wide enough for an animal to be easilyherded into the pen. When moving sick or injuredcattle to the hospital pens, you should ensure thatunnecessary suffering does not occur. These pensshould be easily reached so that you can regularlycheck on the animal. You should make sure thatdrinking water is freely available in the pens, andthat there are feeding facilities. The possibility ofspillage should be minimised by using an appropriatereceptacle and positioning it carefully, so as not towet the lying area and deprive the animal of feed orwater. Ideally, you should also be able to milk anycows in them, if you need to. 41 If an unfit animal does not respond to treatment, it should be humanely killed on-farm (culled). Youshould cull any animals suffering from an incurablecondition (such as mucosal disease or Johne 's disease), poisoning or untreatable painful conditions,as soon as possible after diagnosis. Downer animals 42 When an animal is unable to rise - a 'downer animal ' - the prospect for recovery of the animal can be greatly increased by providing quality care in theinitial period of recumbency. The animal should beprovided with a comfortable dry lying area and givenfood and water. Treatment should include frequentturning to ensure that the animal is not continuouslyresting on one side or leg, which could lead toirreversible muscle damage. 43 When an animal becomes recumbent, it is important to identify the likely cause. Where there isa history of trauma, for example, falling or slipping, aveterinary surgeon should assess the extent of anyinjury. Where the prognosis for recovery is poor,early intervention, by humanely destroying theanimal on-farm, should not be delayed. 44 Where the history indicates a medical origin for the recumbency, such as milk fever or toxic mastitis,appropriate treatment should be given in accordancewith veterinary advice. Where a 'downer animal ' has not responded to treatment, it should be assessed bya veterinary surgeon. Attempts to lift 'downer animals ' must not be made prior to an assessment by a veterinary surgeon, to ensure that the procedurewill not result in additional suffering for the animal. The Welfare of Animals (Transport) Order 1997 (S.I. 1997 No. 1480) Articles 4 (1) and 6 respectivelyprovide that: - - No person shall transport any animal in a way which causes or is likely to cause injury orunnecessary suffering to that animal. - No person shall transport any animal unless: - it is fit for the intended journey; and- suitable provision has been made for its care during the journey and on arrival at the place of destination. 13Section 1 - Recommendations for all cattle 12Section 1 - Recommendations for all cattleAt present, burial or burning is only permitted in very limited circumstances. If you plan to bury the carcasson-farm, you should first check that the localauthority allows this under the Animal By-ProductsOrder 1999. However, from 30 April 2003, new EUlegislation, the Animal By-Products Regulation, willban the routine burial or burning of animal carcases. Record Keeping The Welfare of Farmed Animals (England) Regulations 2000 (S.I. 2000 No. 1870) Schedule 1,paragraph 7, states that: A record shall be maintained of - (a) any medicinal treatment given to animals; and(b) the number of mortalities found on each inspection of animals carried out in accordance with any of the following provisions. Schedule 1, paragraph 8 states that: - The record referred to in paragraph 7 shall beretained for a period of at least three years from thedate on which the medicinal treatment was given, orthe date of the inspection, as the case may be, andshall be made available to an authorised personwhen carrying out an inspection or when otherwiserequested by such person. It is a requirement under the Animals and Animal Products (Examination for Residues and MaximumResidue Limits) Regulations 1997 (S.I. 1997 No.1729),Part V, paragraph 32, that you keep a record of: 'The name and address of the supplier of the veterinary medicinal product '.49 You should only buy and use authorised animal medicines. You must keep full records of all themedicine you buy, including where you bought it.Also, you must keep records for at least three years of: the date you treated the animals; how much medicine you used; and which animal or group of animals you treated. You will find more information in the Code of Practice on responsible use of animal medicines onthe farm (see the Appendix). 50 In terms of individual animal management, you may find it useful, as part of the health and welfareplan, to note specific cases of mastitis, lameness anddisorders, such as milk fever, and where appropriate,the relevant treatment given. 15Section 1 - Recommendations for all cattle For these purposes an animal shall not be considered fit for its intended journey if it is ill, injured, infirm orfatigued, unless it is only slightly ill, injured, infirm orfatigued and the intended journey is not likely tocause it unnecessary suffering, likely to give birthduring transport, has given birth during the previous48 hours or is a new born animal in which the navelhas not completely healed. 45 You can only transport an unfit animal if you are taking it to a veterinary surgeon for treatment ordiagnosis, or to the nearest available place ofslaughter and even then, only if you do so in a waythat does not cause the animal any more suffering.You will find more information in Defra 's booklet, 'Guidance on the transport of casualty farm animals ' (see the Appendix). 46 In an emergency, you may have to slaughter an animal immediately to prevent its suffering. In suchcases, you should destroy the animal humanely and,where possible, it should be done by someone whois suitably trained and competent both in slaughtermethods and use of the equipment. Under theseemergency circumstances a slaughter licence is notrequired. It is a general offence under the Welfare of Animals (Slaughter or Killing) Regulations 1995 (S.I. 1995 No.731) as amended by the Welfare of Animals(Slaughter or Killing) (Amendment) Regulations 1999(S.I. 1999 No. 400), to cause or permit any avoidableexcitement, pain or suffering to any animal duringslaughter or killing (regulation 4(1)). The general offence applies in all cases, but the detailed provisions in respect of the method ofslaughter or killing do not apply when an animal hasto be killed immediately for emergency reasons(regulation 13(2)). 47 If you have to slaughter the animals on-farm in a non-emergency situation, you must do so using apermitted method which is in line with currentwelfare at slaughter legislation (see box below). The Welfare of Animals (Slaughter or Killing) Regulations 1995 (S.I. 1995 No. 731) as amended bythe Welfare of Animals (Slaughter or Killing)(Amendment) Regulations 1999 (S.I. 1999 No. 400)state that when an animal is slaughtered or killed on-farm, this must be done using a permitted method.The animal could be: - stunned using a captive bolt pistol, concussion stunner or electrical stunner after which it must befollowed by bleeding - or pithed - without delay (regulation 14 and Schedules 5 (Part II) and 6). If theanimal is stunned and bled, the operation must becarried out by a slaughterman licensed for theseoperations (Schedule 1), unless the owner isslaughtering an animal for his own consumption; or - killed by a free bullet (regulation 15 and Schedule 5 Part III); the animal should be killed with a singleshot to the head. 48 After slaughter, you must dispose of the carcass by a suitable method (see the box below): Article 5 of the Animal By-Products Order 1999 (S.I. 1999 No.646) requires that fallen stock are disposedof by: - despatch to a knackers yard, hunt kennel or similar premises; - incineration;- rendering;- in certain circumstances, burial in such a way that carnivorous animals cannot gain access to thecarcass, or burning. This provision applies to the disposal of still-born or unborn calves, as well as to older cattle. The Dogs Acts 1906-28 include provisions making it an offence for a person knowingly to permit acarcass to remain unburied in a place to which dogscould gain access. 14Section 1 - Recommendations for all cattleGeneral The Welfare of Farmed Animals (England) Regulations 2000 (S.I. 2000 No. 1870) Schedule 1,paragraphs 11 and 12, state that: - materials used for the construction of accommodation, and, in particular for theconstruction of pens, cages, stalls and equipmentwith which animals may come into contact, shallnot be harmful to them and shall be capable ofbeing thoroughly cleaned and disinfected. - accommodation and fittings for securing animals shall be constructed and maintained so that thereare no sharp edges or protrusions likely to causeinjury to them. The Welfare of Farmed Animals (England) Regulations 2000 (S.I. 2000 No. 1870) Schedule 1,paragraph 4, states that: - where any animals (other than poultry) are kept in a building they shall be kept on, or have access atall times to, a lying area which either has well-maintained dry bedding or is well-drained; The Welfare of Farmed Animals (England) Regulations 2000 (S.I. 2000 No. 1870) Schedule 1,paragraph 9 states that: - The freedom of movement of animals, having regard to their species and in accordance withestablished experience and scientific knowledge,shall not be restricted in such a way as to causethem unnecessary suffering or injury. Schedule 1, paragraph 10 states that, where animals are continuously or regularly tethered orconfined: - they shall be given space appropriate to their physiological and ethological needs in accordancewith established experience and scientificknowledge.56 The more you limit the space that cattle have in the housing system you provide, the less choice theanimal has to avoid unfavourable conditions.Housed cattle need constant care and attentionfrom staff who are well trained in the nutritionaland environmental needs of cattle. 57 No matter how long you house the animals, their accommodation should give them shelter andenough room to move around and interact witheach other. The accommodation should provideenough space for a subordinate animal to moveaway from a dominant one. It is important toprovide as comfortable an area as possible, so thatthe animals can lie down for as long as they wantand have enough space to stand up again. Thefloor should not slope too steeply - no more than about 10% - as steeper slopes can cause legproblems, slipping and falling. 58 You should keep all concrete yards and passageways in good condition. They should notbe too rough as this can graze or even cut the solesof the animals ' feet. On the other hand, the yards and passageways must not be worn smooth, as theanimals are then likely to slip and possibly cause legand other damage. You should not let slurry buildup on concrete floors and passageways, as this willalso make the floor slippery. 59 Where slatted floors are used, you should pay particular attention to the type of slats, to avoidslipperiness. The gaps between the slats should notbe wide enough to cause foot injuries (for example,when claws get trapped). You should only useslatted pens for the size of animals that they weredesigned for. 60 You should not use fully-slatted concrete floors for breeding cows or replacement heifers. Wherethere are slats, part of the accommodation shouldbe a solid-floor area with straw or some othersuitable bedding material, so that the animals willbe comfortable and less likely to injure themselves -particularly their udders. 17AccommodationSection 1 - Recommendations for all cattle The Welfare of Farmed Animals (England) Regulations 2000 (S.I. 2000 No. 1870) Schedule 1,paragraphs 22-27, states that: - Animals shall be fed a wholesome diet which is appropriate to their age and species and which is fedto them in sufficient quantity to maintain them ingood health and to satisfy their nutritional needs andto promote a positive state of well-being. - No animals shall be provided with food or liquid in a manner, nor shall such food or liquid contain anysubstance, which may cause them unnecessarysuffering or injury. - All animals shall have access to feed at intervals appropriate to their physiological needs (and, in anycase, at least once a day), except where a veterinarysurgeon acting in the exercise of his professionotherwise directs. - All animals shall either have access to a suitable water supply and be provided with an adequatesupply of fresh drinking water each day or be able tosatisfy their fluid intake needs by other means. - Feeding and watering equipment shall be designed, constructed, placed and maintained so thatcontamination of food and water and the harmfuleffects of competition between animals areminimised. - No other substance, with the exception of those given for therapeutic or prophylactic purposes or forthe purpose of zootechnical treatment shall beadministered to animals unless it has beendemonstrated by scientific studies of animal welfareor established experience that the effect of thatsubstance is not detrimental to the health or welfareof the animals. 51 All cattle need a balanced daily diet to maintain full health and energy. You should monitor howmuch forage is available and when there is no longer enough for the animals ' needs, you should supplement it with other suitable feeds. You shouldregularly check the weight and type of supplementaryfeeds offered, to make sure they are well balanced.You should plan any changes in the diet and introduce them gradually. 52 Sufficient roughage must be available in all diets to reduce the risk of inducing bloat or laminitis. Inintensive barley beef systems, long roughage, such asstraw, should be made available ad lib . Where total mixed rations are used, you should seek specialistadvice. 53 Animals that have been isolated for treatment must have plenty of water available. Unless aveterinary surgeon tells you otherwise, you must givethe animal its normal feed. 54 There should be enough water available for at least 10% of housed cattle to drink at any one time.Water troughs - especially those in loose housing orcubicle units - should be designed and placed where: they are protected from fouling; and there is a low risk of the water freezing in cold weather. where there is sufficient space and easy access for all stock and dead-ends are avoided. You should keep water troughs or bowls thoroughly clean and check them at least once a day to makesure they are not blocked or damaged, and thewater is flowing freely. Checking for blockages isequally important where drinking nipples are used.Provision must be made for providing emergencysupplies of water. 55 For grazing cattle, you need the appropriate number of water troughs (large enough and of theright design) or some other source of drinkable water(such as a bowser, or water tanker) that the animalscan readily use wherever they are grazing. Theseareas should allow easy access, be smooth underfootand not prone to waterlogging. 16Section 1 - Recommendations for all cattle Feed, water and other substancesCowsheds 69 In cowsheds, the lying area should be big enough to help keep the cows clean andcomfortable and to avoid them damaging theirjoints. You need to untie tethered cows and letthem exercise at least once a day and give themfeed and water if it is a long exercise period. Theanimals should also be able to groom themselveswhen tethered. The cowshed needs to be wellventilated. 70 Feed and water troughs should be designed and placed where smaller animals cannot get intothem and you should keep the troughs clean.Where particular feeds are not provided ad lib , the troughs should enable all the animals in the pen toeat at the same time to avoid excessive aggression. 71 The internal surfaces of housing and pens should be made of materials that you can clean anddisinfect and easily replace when necessary. 72 If you are going to treat these surfaces, use paints or wood preservatives that are safe to usewith animals. There is a risk of lead poisoning fromold paintwork, especially if you use second-handbuilding materials. Space allowances 73 You should work out the space allowance for cattle housed in groups in terms of: the whole environment; the age, sex, liveweight and behavioural needs of the stock; the size of the group; and whether any of the animals have horns; and you should base your decision on expert advice.Ventilation The Welfare of Farmed Animals (England) Regulations 2000 (S.I. 2000 No. 1870) Schedule 1,paragraph 13, states that: - air circulation, dust levels, temperature, relative humidity and gas concentrations shall be keptwithin limits which are not harmful to the animals. 74 All new buildings should be designed with the animals ' comfort in mind, and with the aim of preventing respiratory diseases. The buildingsshould provide enough ventilation throughout theyear for the type, size and number of stock to behoused in them. Where appropriate, roofs shouldbe insulated to reduce solar penetration. 75 Where the ventilation in existing buildings is not good enough, you should adapt these buildings byimproving air inlets and outlets, or by usingmechanical equipment (such as a fan). 76 When you are removing slurry from under slats, you must take special care to avoid fouling the airwith dangerous gases (such as methane), which cankill both humans and animals. Ideally, slurry tanksshould be emptied when the building is not in use.Where it becomes necessary to remove slurry whencattle are being housed, you should take all stockout of the building. Buildings should be wellventilated during this procedure. Lighting The Welfare of Farmed Animals (England) Regulations 2000 (S.I. 2000 No. 1870), Schedule 1,Paragraph 3 states that: - where animals are kept in a building, adequate lighting (whether fixed or portable) shall beavailable to enable them to be thoroughly inspectedat any time. 19Section 1 - Recommendations for all cattle 61 You should keep bulls reared for slaughter in small groups, ideally no more than 20 animals ineach. You should not normally add bulls to groupsalready formed, and neither should you add onegroup to another to send to slaughter. You shouldkeep groups of bulls at a safe distance from femalecattle. Straw yards 62 Ideally, for dairy herds you should completely clean out straw yards every four to six weeks. Thisis so that the cows do not get too dirty and toreduce the risk of mastitis from bacteria in thebedding (i.e. environmental mastitis). If you usestraw yards, you should top them up with clean,dry straw every day. In the case of suckler herds,the frequency of cleaning out and topping up canbe reduced. You should make sure that there isenough clean and dry straw available for as long asthe animals are housed. Where possible, youshould store this straw under cover to keep it dry.There should be enough space for all the animals tolie in comfort at the same time, and to stand upand move freely. 63 There should be enough room for all the animals in the management group to lie down andmove around freely. Where feed and water troughsare accessible from the bedded area, measuresshould be put in place to reduce fouling. Wherefeed and water troughs are provided in theadjacent loafing area, the access areas should besufficiently wide to permit free movement ofanimals and prevent routes becoming wet, fouledand slippery. Where a loafing area is used it should,ideally, be partly covered. You will need to controlthe build-up of slurry in passageways and loafingareas by scraping at least twice a day. 64 Where appropriate, you should take cows that are bulling away from the main group temporarily,so that the risk of teat injuries is reduced and thestraw yard will not be churned up. Churned-up straw can dirty the cows and may lead to mastitis. Cubicles 65 If you are installing cubicles or adapting your existing facilities, you should get specialist advice.You need to consider the size, shape and weight ofthe animals when you design the cubicles. Cubiclepassageways should be wide enough for cows topass one another easily. 66 Cubicles should be designed to encourage cows to lie down and stand up easily without injuringthemselves. You need to have enough bedding to: keep the cows comfortable; prevent them from getting contact or pressure sores (from always lying in the same or cramped positions); and keep the cows ' teats, udders and flanks clean. You must never use a bare, solid base in the cubicles. The kerb should not be so high that itstrains the cows ' legs as they enter or leave the cubicle, neither should the bed be so low that itbecomes contaminated with slurry. 67 Where you do have cubicles, you should have at least one for each cow. About 5% more cubiclesthan the number of cows in the managementgroup is recommended. You should train heifers tolie correctly in cubicles by encouragement (givingthem familiar bedding), rather than by restraint(such as tethering them). 68 It is important that you keep slurry to a minimum, either by scraping out the passagewaysat least twice a day or by using slattedpassageways. You should clean the cubicle baseeach day and replace the bedding as necessary, tokeep the lying area clear of manure. 18Section 1 - Recommendations for all cattleThe Welfare of Farmed Animals (England) Regulations 2000 (S.I. 2000 No. 1870) (Schedule 1,Paragraphs 18-21), state that: - All automated or mechanical equipment essential for the health and well-being of the animals shallbe inspected at least once a day to check there isno defect in it. - Where defects in automated or mechanical equipment of the type referred to in the paragraphabove are discovered, these shall be rectifiedimmediately, or if this is impossible, appropriatesteps shall be taken to safeguard the health andwell-being of the animals pending the rectificationof such defects including the use of alternativemethods of feeding and watering and methods ofproviding and maintaining a satisfactoryenvironment. - Where the health and well-being of the animals is dependent on an artificial ventilation system - - provision shall be made for an appropriate back- up system to guarantee sufficient air renewal topreserve the health and well-being of the animals inthe event of failure of the system; and - an alarm system (which will operate even if the principal electricity supply to it has failed) shall beprovided to give warning of any failure of thesystem. - The back-up system shall be thoroughly inspected and the alarm system shall each be tested at leastonce every seven days in order to check that thereis no defect in the system and, if any defect isfound (whether when the system is inspected ortested in accordance with this paragraph or at anyother time) it shall be rectified immediately. 78 All mains electrical equipment should meet relevant standards and be properly earthed,safeguarded from rodents and out of the animals ' reach. 21EquipmentSection 1 - Recommendations for all cattle Schedule 1, paragraphs 14-16 state that: - Animals kept in buildings shall not be kept in permanent darkness. - Where the natural light available in a building is insufficient to meet the physiological andethological needs of any animals being kept in itthen appropriate artificial lighting shall be provided. - Animals kept in buildings shall not be kept without an appropriate period of rest from artificiallighting. 77 During daylight hours, indoor lighting - whether it is natural or artificial - should be bright enoughfor you to clearly see all the housed cattle and forthe cattle to feed and behave normally. Also, youshould have enough fixed or portable lightingavailable at any time if you need to inspect anyanimals, for example, during calving. 20Section 1 - Recommendations for all cattleon conviction liable to a fine. The Act also contains additional powers, which enable the Secretary ofState to take action to arrange for the weeds to becleared and recover the cost of doing so, ifnecessary through the Courts. The five weeds thatthis legislation applies to are: - Spear thistle (Cirsium vulgare) find out more information on injurious weeds in Defra 's leaflets, 'The Weeds Act - Preventing the spread of harmful weeds '; 'The Weeds Act - Guidance notes on the methods that can be used to control harmful weeds ' and 'Identification of injurious weeds ' (see the Appendix). 23Section 1 - Recommendations for all cattle General The Welfare of Farmed Animals (England) Regulations 2000 (S.I. 2000 No 1870) Schedule 1,paragraph 17, states that: - Animals not kept in buildings shall, where necessary and possible, be given protection fromadverse weather conditions, predators and risks totheir health and shall, at all times, have access to awell-drained lying area. 79 Where there is no natural or artificial shelter to protect grazing stock from extreme weatherconditions, you should move them to a moresuitable area. Shelter or natural shade from trees orhedges is important in summer as heat stress causesanimals (particularly high-yielding cows and dark-coated suckler cows) severe problems such as: abnormal breathing; severe loss of appetite; serious weight loss; and anoestrus (cows not coming into season). 80 Where animals are outwintered they must have access to a well-drained lying area and, wherepossible, be provided with shelter from adverseweather conditions. 81 You should have a concrete standing area, or well-drained, suitable surface, that will not injureanimals ' feet around feed and water troughs. The surface on which the animals walk to reach thetroughs should also be well drained. Otherwise,you should move the troughs quite often so thatthe animals are not standing in the same muddyand fouled areas. 82 You should take all practical measures to remove all cattle from areas that are in imminentdanger of flooding.83 You should keep all the farm 's fields and buildings clear of debris such as wire or batteries(with their risk of lead poisoning), or plastic orsharp metal objects that could injure the cattle orrip out their ear tags and damage their ears. Fencing and hedges 84 You should look after your fences, trim hedges and remove any obstructions or snags (on hedges,gates, fences or feeding troughs) that could catchon ear tags. 85 You should make sure that any electric fences are designed, constructed, used and maintainedproperly, so that when the animals touch them theyonly feel slight discomfort. All power units forelectric fences must be properly earthed to preventshort circuits or electricity being conductedanywhere it should not be, for example, gates andwater troughs. Injurious weeds 86 You should control injurious (harmful) weeds because they can harm animals by: poisoning them (for example, ragwort); injuring them (for example, thistle); and reducing their grazing area by reducing the edible plants that are available. Under the Weeds Act 1959, the Secretary of State for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, mayserve an enforcement notice on an occupier of landon which one or more of the five injurious weedsare growing requiring the occupier to take action toprevent the weeds from spreading. The Act permitsDefra officials to enter land to inspect whether anenforcement notice has been complied with. If anoccupier has unreasonably failed to comply with thenotice, he or she shall be guilty of an offence and 22Section 1 - Recommendations for all cattle ManagementThe Welfare of Farmed Animals (England) Regulations 2000 (S.I. 2000 No. 1870), Schedule 5,paragraphs 1 and 2 state that: - Where any lactating dairy cows or any cows which are calving are kept in any roofed accommodationthey shall have access at all times to a well-drainedand bedded lying area. - Where any cows which are calving are kept in a building, they shall be kept - (a) in a pen or yard which is of such size as to permit a person to attend the cows; and (b) separate from other livestock other than calving cows. 90 A large proportion of calving difficulties and losses can be prevented by making sure that cowsare at the correct condition at calving. Stock-keepers in charge of calving should be: familiar with all the signs that a cow is about to calve; and well trained in caring for calving cows and their calves, including the use of mechanical calving aids. 91 You should always provide adequate supervision at calving, whilst ensuring that calving cows shouldnot be disturbed, unless there are indications thatthe birth process is not proceeding normally.Enough space should be available to allow cows toexhibit their normal behaviour at calving. If space islimited, you should not house heifers with oldercows, as the cows may dominate their feeding andlying areas. 92 Before you use any type of recognised calving aid, you should examine the cow to make sure thatthe calf is properly presented (i.e. in the correctposition - head first, the right way up and with the head between the two front feet). You also needto check that the calf is not too large for a naturaldelivery, so that it will not cause any unnecessarypain or distress to either mother or offspring.93 If you have any concerns about the presentation or the ability to calve naturally, youshould get advice from a veterinary surgeonimmediately. 94 If you help in the delivery, good hygiene of both yourself and the equipment, is essential. Youshould clean and disinfect calving aids and ropesafter each time you use them. You should only usecalving aids to help with a delivery, not to extractthe calf as quickly as possible. Calving ropes needto be flexible and thick enough not to damage thecalf. After the birth, you should treat the calf 's navel with a suitable antiseptic to prevent infection,particularly when calves are born inside. 95 Where calving pens are used, you should do everything possible to prevent the build-up andspread of infection by making sure that they haveenough clean bedding and that they are regularlycleaned and disinfected. 96 Where cows and their calves are group housed, calves should have a separate solid floor andbedded area which the cows are unable to access. 97 Calving should not be induced routinely. Induction does have a role to play in preventingoversized calves, but you should seek advice fromyour veterinary surgeon. 25Pregnancy and calvingSection 2 - Specific recommendations 87 There should be plans in place to deal with emergencies at your farm, such as fire, flood ordisruption of supplies (for example, no electricity formilking machines). The owner should make surethat all the staff are familiar with the appropriateemergency action. You will find more informationin the Defra booklets, 'Emergencies on livestock farms ' and 'Farm fires: advice on farm animal welfare ' (see the Appendix). 88 It is important that you get advice about design when you are building or modifying a building.You need to be able to release and evacuatelivestock quickly if there is an emergency by, forexample, having outward opening doors and gates.You should consider installing fire alarms that canbe heard and responded to at any time of the dayor night. 89 You can get expert advice on all fire precautions from your local fire prevention officers and from theFire Prevention Association. 24Section 1 - Recommendations for all cattle Fire and other emergency precautionsSchedule 4, paragraph 12 states that: (1) All calves shall be provided with food which contains sufficient iron to ensure a bloodhaemoglobin level of at least 4.5mmol/litre. (2) A minimum daily ration of fibrous food shall be provided for each calf over 2 weeks old, the quantitybeing raised in line with the growth of the calf froma minimum of 100g at 2 weeks old to a minimum of 250g at 20 weeks old. Schedule 4, paragraph 13 states that calves shall not be muzzled. Schedule 4, paragraph 14 states that: (1) All calves shall be fed at least twice a day. (2) Where calves are housed in a group and do not have continuous access to feed, or are not fed by anautomatic feeding system, each calf shall have accessto food at the same time as the others in the feedinggroup. Schedule 4, paragraph 15 states that: (1) Subject to sub-paragraph (2) below, all calves shall be provided with a sufficient quantity of freshdrinking water each day. (2) Calves shall be provided with fresh drinking water at all times - (a) in hot weather conditions, or(b) when they are ill. 103 Bovine colostrum is essential to protect the calf against infectious disease. Ideally calves should be leftwith their dam for at least 12 and preferably 24 hoursafter birth. It is recommended that the calf shouldcontinue to receive colostrum from its mother for thefirst three days of life. Allowing the calf to sucklenaturally may be the best way to make sure that itgets enough colostrum. However, you shouldsupervise suckling carefully and ensure that the udderis clean before the calf sucks. If the calf is unable tosuck, colostrum should be given by a suitably trainedperson using a stomach tube. When there is any doubt about the quantity or quality of colostrum thatis available from the cow, you should give it to thecalf by teat feeder or stomach tube from anothersource within six hours of its birth. A store of frozenor some other form of colostrum should be kept onthe farm for use in emergencies. 104 Removing the calf earlier than 12-24 hours after birth should only be done for disease controlpurposes, under the advice of a veterinary surgeonand the protocol should be recorded in the healthand welfare plan. These calves should still be fedcolostrum. In some circumstances, such as in thecontrol of Johne 's disease, the use of pooled colostrum may promote the transfer of infection. In such cases, to prevent the risk of the spread ofinfection in the herd, you should ensure that eachcalf receives colostrum only from its dam or if this isnot possible, only from a single animal. 105 You can increase the value of colostrum by specific vaccination of the cow or colostrum donor.In high-yielding dairy cows, you may find that theconcentration of antibodies in colostrum is diluted.You should get advice from your veterinary surgeonon ways to improve colostrum to protect calvesagainst infectious diseases. 106 You should not offer milk from cows treated with antibiotics or those being treated for mastitis tocalves fed on whole milk. 107 In artificial calf-rearing systems, it is better for the calf to drink from, or be able to reach a dummyteat. Fresh water should be available in the pen. All calves should receive liquid food every day duringtheir first four weeks of life and, in any case, untilthey are eating enough solid food. 108 When calves are put on unlimited milk-feeding diets, you should make sure that they have enoughteats to avoid undue competition and watch themcarefully to check that they are all feeding properly. 27Section 2 - Specific recommendations General The Welfare of Farmed Animals (England) Regulations 2000 (S.I. 2000 No. 1870) Regulation 6,states that owners and keepers of calves confined forthe rearing and fattening shall ensure that, inaddition to the requirements set out in Schedule 1,the conditions under which the animals are keptcomply with the requirements set out in Schedule 4. 98 Caring for calves, particularly when you buy calves from a number of sources, should be part ofyour written health and welfare plan. As calves aremore susceptible to a number of diseases, goodhygiene is essential, particularly with the equipmentused artificially to rear calves. You will find moreinformation in Defra 's booklet, 'Improving calf survival ' (see the Appendix). Inspection The Welfare of Farmed Animals (England) Regulations 2000 (S.I. 2000 No. 1870) Schedule 4,paragraphs 3 and 4, state that: - All housed calves shall be inspected by the owner or keeper of the calves at least twice a day to checkthat they are in a state of well-being. - Calves which are kept outside shall be inspected by the owner or keeper of the calves at least once a dayto check that they are in a state of well-being. 99 It is particularly important that you watch calves carefully for signs of diarrhoea or respiratory disease,such as coughing or rapid or laboured breathing,both of which could spread rapidly. When you buyin calves, you should inspect them as soon as theyarrive, before they come into contact with othercalves on the farm. You need to assess their generalhealth, paying particular attention to their posture,breathing and the condition of their nose, eyes,navel, anus, feet and legs. 100 After carefully inspecting any calves you have bought, you should rest them in comfortableconditions for a few hours and then give them a firstfeed of milk or other suitable liquid, such aselectrolyte solution. Where practicable, you shouldkeep them apart from other calves for long enoughto prevent any possible cross-infection. 101 If you rear calves in a system where milk is provided by artificial means, you should closelymonitor their feed intake. If calves have a reduced orslower feed intake, this is often an early sign ofdisease. Sick and injured calves In addition to the provisions laid down in Schedule 1, paragraph 5 of the Welfare of Farmed Animals(England) Regulations 2000 (S.I. 2000 No. 1870),Schedule 4 paragraph 5 states that: - - where necessary sick or injured calves shall be isolated in suitable accommodation with drycomfortable bedding. 102 You should isolate and treat calves if, for example, they have diarrhoea or pneumonia.Monitoring their temperature is a useful means ofassessing their response to treatment. If the calvesdo not respond to treatment promptly or properly orthese illnesses return, you need to get advice from aveterinary surgeon. Feed, water and other substances The Welfare of Farmed Animals (England) Regulations 2000 (S.I. 2000 No. 1870) Schedule 4,paragraph 11, states that: - each calf shall receive bovine colostrum as soon as possible after it is born and in any case within thefirst six hours of life. 26Section 2 - Specific recommendations Calf rearingother animals in neighbouring stalls and pens unless isolated for veterinary reasons. Tethering 6. -(1) Calves shall not be tethered, with the exception of group-housed calves which may be tethered for a period of not more than one hour when being fed milk or milk substitute. (2) Where tethers are used in accordance with the preceding sub-paragraph, they shall not cause pain or injury to the calves and shall be inspected regularly and adjusted as necessary to ensure a comfortable fit. (3) Each tether shall be designed to avoid the risk of strangulation or pain or injury and allow the calf to lie down, rest, stand up and groom itself without hindrance. Lighting 7. Where calves are kept in an artificially lit building then, subject to paragraphs 14 and 16 of Schedule 1, artificial lighting shall be provided for a period at least equivalent to the period of natural light normally available between 9.00 a.m. and 5.00 p.m. Cleansing and Disinfection 8. -(1) Housing, stalls, pens, equipment and utensils used for calves shall be properly cleaned and disinfected to prevent cross-infection and the build-up of disease-carrying organisms. (2) Faeces, urine and uneaten or spilt food shall be removed as often as necessary to minimise smell and to avoid attracting flies or rodents. Floors 9. Where calves are kept in a building, floors shall- - be smooth but not slippery so as to prevent injury to the calves;- be so designed as not to cause injury or suffering to calves standing or lying on them; - be suitable for the size and weight of the calves;and - form a rigid, even and stable surface. Bedding and lying area 10.-(1) All calves shall be provided with appropriate bedding. (2) All calves shall be kept on, or at all times have access to, a lying area which is clean, comfortable and well-drained and which does not adversely affect the calves. (3) All housed calves and calves kept in hutches or temporary structures shall be kept on, or at all times have access to, a lying area which is well-maintained with dry bedding. 111 Housed calves need an environment that is: dry; well drained; well bedded; well ventilated; and draught free. The calves must have enough space for each of them to lie down comfortably. Young calves areparticularly susceptible to pneumonia so goodventilation is essential. Ventilation should not berestricted to try and raise the air temperature. 112 Until they are weaned, you should keep housed calves in small groups to: make it easier for you to inspect them; and limit the spread of disease. When calves are fed by natural suckling, other penning arrangements may be satisfactory. 113 You should not put newborn and young calves on totally slatted floors. Suitable bedding shouldalways be provided. 29Section 2 - Specific recommendations You should take the same care when you introduce solid food, as and when the calves want it. 109 You should wean suckler calves so that it causes as little stress as possible to both cows andcalves. You should take particular care of newly-weaned suckling calves and keep them in groups offamiliar animals to avoid fighting and cross-contamination. If you have to mix some of theanimals, to minimise disease you should make surethat the environment does not stress the calves. 110 You should avoid the routine early weaning of suckled beef calves (at two to three months old) as itcan increase the post weaning growth check and thusreduce their resistance to disease. Weaned calvesmust always have access to fresh forage and weanermix. You should replace the feed each day so that thefood is fresh and appetising. Weaning at between sixand nine months of age is recommended, althoughearlier weaning is acceptable for suckler calves wherethe cow 's health or body condition is poor. Accommodation The Welfare of Farmed Animals (England) Regulations 2000 (S.I. 2000 No. 1870) Schedule 4,states that: 1. -(1) No calf shall be confined in an individual stall or pen after the age of eight weeks unless a veterinary surgeon certifies that its health or behaviour requires it to be isolated in order to receive treatment. (2) The width of any individual stall or pen for a calf shall be at least equal to the height of the calf at the withers, measured in the standing position, and the length shall be at least equal to the body length of the calf, measured from the tip of the nose to the caudal edge of the tuber ischii (pin bone), multiplied by 1.1. (3) Individual stalls or pens for calves (except for those isolating sick animals) shall have perforated walls which allow calves to have direct visual and tactile contact. (4) For calves kept in groups, the unobstructed space allowance available to each calf shall be -- at least 1.5 square metres for each calf with a live weight of less than 150 kg, - at least 2 square metres for each calf with a live weight of 150 kg or more but less than 200 kg, and - at least 3 square metres for each calf with a live weight of 200 kg or more. (5) Each calf shall be able to stand up, turn around, lie down, rest and groom itself without hindrance. (6) Subject to sub-paragraphs (7) and (8) below, each calf that is kept on a holding on which two or more calves are kept shall be able to see at least one other calf. (7) Sub-paragraph (6) above shall not apply to any calf that is kept in isolation on a holding on veterinary advice. (8) For the purpose of calculating the number of calves being kept on a holding in order to determine whether sub-paragraph (6) above applies, no account shall be taken of any calf that is being kept in isolation on that holding on veterinary advice. Transitional provisions for accommodation 2. -(1) Until 1st January 2004 sub-paragraphs (1), (3) and (4) of paragraph 1 shall not apply in relation to accommodation in use before 1st January 1998. (2) Until 1st January 2004, in the case of accommodation brought into use after 1st January 1994 but before 1st January 1998 - (a) where calves are housed in groups, each calfof 150 kg or more live weight shall have at least1.5 square metres of unobstructed floor space;and (b) where a calf is housed in an individual stallor pen, the stall or pen shall have at least one perforated wall which enables the calf to see 28Section 2 - Specific recommendationsprocedure. If you feel that dehorning is necessary, it should be done in spring or autumn to avoid flies orfrosts. Following the procedure, the animal shouldbe given appropriate pain relief. You should protectthe wound from contamination by such things asgrass seeds, hay or silage until the hole has scabbedover. You should put hay racks at a level whichreduces the risk of food falling onto the head andcontaminating the wound. 119 The person doing the disbudding or dehorning should always allow enough time for the anaestheticto numb the area before they begin. They shouldtest this by pricking the skin in the area to seewhether the animal can still feel anything around thehorn bud or the base of the horn. Supernumerary teats Under the Veterinary Surgeons Act 1966, as amended, only a veterinary surgeon may remove asupernumerary teat from a calf which has reachedthree months of age. - The Protection of Animals (Anaesthetics) Act 1954 makes it an offence to remove a supernumerary teatfrom a calf which has reached three months of agewithout the use of an anaesthetic. 120 If an animal has supernumerary teats (i.e. too many teats) and the extra ones are to be removed,the operation should be done at an early age.Anyone carrying out the procedure should besuitably trained and competent. Once the localanaesthetic has numbed the area and antiseptic hasbeen applied, the teats should beremoved with clean, sharp scissors. Any bleedingshould be stopped immediately. 31Section 2 - Specific recommendations Moving and selling calves The Welfare of Animals (Transport) Order 1997 (S.I. 1997 No. 1480) Article 6, states that: (3) Animals shall not be considered fit for transport if (inter alia) they are newborn animals in which the navel has not completely healed. The Welfare of Animals at Markets Order 1990 (S.I. 1990 No. 2627), Article 14, states that: - - no person shall bring to a market a calf which is less than 7 days old or which has an unhealed navel. - no person shall bring to a market a calf which has been brought to a market on more than oneoccasion in the previous 28 days. - it shall be the duty of the owner of any calf in a market on any day, or of his duly authorised agent ,to remove it from the market within 4 hours of thetime when the last sale by auction of a calf hastaken place on that day. - in this article \"calf\" means a bovine animal under 12 weeks of age. 114 To reduce the risk of disease, wherever possible, you should make arrangements to transfer the calvesdirectly from farm to farm rather than through a market. 115 Ideally, young calves reared without their mothers, should receive human contact, preferablyfrom the same stock-keeper. Castration Under the Protection of Animals (Anaesthetics) Act 1954, as amended, it is an offence to castrate calveswhich have reached two months of age without theuse of an anaesthetic. Furthermore, the use of arubber ring, or other device, to restrict the flow ofblood to the scrotum, is only permitted without ananaesthetic if the device is applied during the firstweek of life.Under the Veterinary Surgeons Act 1966, as amended, only a veterinary surgeon may castrate acalf which has reached the age of two months. 116 Stock-keepers should consider carefully whether castration is necessary. If it is necessary, there arethree methods which can be used to castrate calves: a rubber ring or other device, which can only be used in the first seven days of life, by a trained andcompetent stock-keeper, to restrict the flow of blood to the scrotum; bloodless castration, by a trained and competent stock-keeper, by crushing the spermatic cords of calves less than 2 months old, with a burdizzo; castration by a veterinary surgeon, using an anaesthetic. Disbudding and dehorning Under The Protection of Animals (Anaesthetics) Act 1954, as amended, it is an offence to disbud calvesor dehorn any cattle without the use of ananaesthetic other than when chemical cauterisationis used. Chemical cauterisation may only be usedduring the first week of life. 117 Disbudding means removing the horn buds in calves, before any horn material can be seen. It is preferable to dehorning as it is less stressful tothe animal. Disbudding should take place beforecalves are two months old and ideally as soon as you can start to see the horn bud. It is stronglyrecommended that chemical cauterisation should notbe used. Disbudding should only be carried out witha heated iron, under local anaesthetic, by a trainedand competent stock-keeper. 118 Dehorning should not be a routine procedure. It involves cutting or sawing horn and other sensitivetissues under local anaesthetic. Ideally, a veterinarysurgeon should do it, and only if it is necessary forthe herd 's welfare. It should not be a routine 30Section 2 - Specific recommendationsanimals. This is because poor foot trimming can cause lameness. If you are in any doubt, get advicefrom a veterinary surgeon. Natural service - bulls 126Where natural mating is used, young bulls should only be introduced to small groups of cows(ideally 10-15). Extra feed should be offered asnecessary. 127All bulls should have good and safe service conditions. Slatted floors and slippery conditionsunderfoot, (for example, in yards, cubicles andpassageways) are not suitable for mating animals. Artificial insemination (AI) and embryo transfer Under the Artificial Insemination of Cattle (Animal Health) (England and Wales) Regulations 1985 (S.I.1985 No. 1857), as amended, AI may only becarried out by a veterinary surgeon, a competentfull-time employee of a licensed supply centre or, inthe case of cows in his ownership, by a farmer orhis employee who has been trained underRegulation 24(b)(iv). Under the Bovine Embryo (Collection, Production and Transfer) Regulations 1995 (S.I. 1995 No.2478): Embryo collection may only be undertaken by someone who is a member of an approved embryocollection team and acting under the authority ofthe team veterinarian; Embryo transfer may be undertaken only by a veterinary surgeon or by a member of an approvedembryo transfer team acting under theresponsibility of the team veterinarian.Before embryo transfer takes place, the recipient cow must be clinically examined by a veterinarysurgeon (within 30 days preceding transfer if theperson who is to carry out the transfer is not aveterinary surgeon). The veterinary surgeon mustcertify that the recipient is suitable to receive theembryo, and that there is no reason at the time ofexamination to believe the recipient would not beable to carry it to term and to calve naturally; Embryo transfer and embryo collection may only be made if the animal concerned is given anappropriate anaesthetic (usually an epidural); Epidural anaesthesia may only be given by a veterinary surgeon, or by somebody trained andacting under the conditions given in Article 3 of the Veterinary Surgery (Epidural Anaesthesia) Order1992 (S.I. 1992 No. 696). 128 You should keep the cows in familiar surroundings until insemination, at which time theycan then be moved to an appropriate stall nearbyand inseminated immediately. 129 Embryo transfer (the transplanting of an embryo from one cow into the uterus of asurrogate mother) should always be carried out inline with The Bovine Embryo (Collection, Productionand Transfer) Regulations 1995. Surgical methodsof embryo collection or transfer may only be carriedout by a veterinary surgeon and should not be usedas part of routine husbandry. Surgical methodsshould only be necessary when it is not possible tocollect or transfer embryos by the usual method. 130 The recipient animal (the cow receiving the embryo) should be able to carry the chosen embryoto full term and to calve normally, without needinga caesarean section. Caesarean sections should notbe routinely undertaken. 131 Ovum pick up (collecting unfertilised eggs direct from the ovary of a cow or heifer, usuallythrough a needle inserted through the wall of thevagina) must only be done by a veterinary surgeon 33Section 2 - Specific recommendations Breeding The Welfare of Farmed Animals (England) Regulations 2000 (S.I. 2000 No. 1870) Schedule 1,paragraph 28, states that: (1) Subject to sub-paragraph (2), natural or artificial breeding or breeding procedures which cause, orare likely to cause, suffering or injury to any of theanimals concerned shall not be practised. (2) Sub-paragraph (1) shall not preclude the use of natural or artificial breeding procedures that arelikely to cause minimal or momentary suffering orinjury or that might necessitate interventions whichwould not cause lasting injury. Schedule 1, paragraph 29 states that: - No animals shall be kept for farming purposes unless it can reasonably be expected, on the basisof their genotype or phenotype, that they can bekept without detrimental effect on their health andwelfare. 121 To rear heifers, you need to demonstrate conscientious and knowledgeable managementduring their growing period, and through tocalving. The animals should show steady growth tomeet recommended target weights, so that theywill successfully calve at a weight and size suitablefor introduction to the adult herd. You should notdeliberately mate heifers that are too small, or matefemales with an inappropriate bull, or breed of bull.If you do, you are likely to produce calves which willbe subject to a high degree of calving difficultiesdue to their high birth weight or conformation.Every effort should be taken to ensure that suchmatings do not take place accidentally. Where itbecomes apparent that an inappropriate mating hasoccurred, veterinary advice should be sought onhow best to handle the situation. 122 A high priority in the breeding selection policy should be to include qualities that will improve thewelfare of the animals, for example, leg and footconformation which would lessen the likelihood of lameness. You should not breed from any animalsthat have deformities or other weaknesses, wherethese could affect the general welfare of the stock.For beef cattle in particular, you should breed fromanimals that are more docile (less aggressive), andalso animals with good muscular-skeletal structures(which can reduce lameness). Where possible, youshould breed from naturally-polled cattle (i.e. thosewith no horns) as this avoids the need fordisbudding or dehorning. Inspection 123 In breeding herds where you use supervised or artificial mating and at calving times, the stock-keeper should allow enough time to monitoroestrus activity, so as to avoid the unnecessary useof hormones or other treatments. At least twice aday, the stock-keeper should inspect all lactatingdairy cows and cattle close to calving. Management 124 A lactating cow needs an appropriate diet to satisfy her nutritional needs, without harming herbody condition and metabolism The amount ananimal consumes will be dependent on thequantity, quality and accessibility of the feedprovided and the time spent eating. Anythingwhich interferes with this, such as lameness, willhave a detrimental effect on the health and welfareof the animal. 125 You should regularly inspect the feet of all cattle - including bulls - and trim them whennecessary. A foot-care programme for your herdshould be part of your farm 's written health and welfare plan. Foot trimming is of value for allcattle, not just for cows that are lame. You shouldnot attempt foot trimming unless you are properlytrained and you have restraining facilities for the 32Section 2 - Specific recommendations Breeding animalsGeneral 135 It is recommended that at least once a month, you should record the daily milk yield of eachlactating dairy cow and monitor this against theappropriate lactation curves for the yield level of theherd. You should use these figures and otheravailable data as a management tool in order toidentify possible welfare problems at an early stage. 136 When you offer concentrated dry feeds on their own to dairy cows, you should normally limit theamounts to a maximum of 4 kg in any one feed. Thisis to reduce the risk of rumen acidosis (i.e. too muchgrain in the rumen leading to digestive problems) andother metabolic disorders. To make sure that theanimals have enough to eat, you should makealternative feeds freely available at all times. 137 To allow for cows to eat as much forage as they want, you should offer more than you expect them toeat each day. You should remove any old or stale feedwhich could contaminate fresh feed and spoil theanimals ' appetites. 138 You should carefully introduce dairy heifers to the adult herd at least four weeks before calving, sothat they have time to get used to their new andunfamiliar surroundings - including the milking parlour. 139 If you are introducing cows of high genetic potential into a dairy herd (i.e. cows that have beenbred for high milk yield), you will need expert adviceon nutrition. High metabolic turnover in such cowscan mean that they have a greater risk of: mastitis; lameness; failure to become pregnant or maintain pregnancy; and metabolic disorders.These animals potentially need a higher standard of management and nutrition to maintain a satisfactorystandard of welfare. 140 Before high-yielding dairy cattle are fed on conserved forages (such as silage and hay), youshould analyse feed samples to check their nutritionalvalue. If necessary, you should get expert advice onhow you can supplement the diet to match theanimals ' age and species. You also need to analyse the quality of feeds you buy (including by-products,such as brewers ' grains), if the supplier does not provide an analysis. 141 You should dry lactating cows off quickly and put them on an appetising forage diet, which willmaintain their body condition. From two to threeweeks before calving, you should gradually introducethe cows to the production ration (i.e. the phasedintroduction of the higher energy, post-calving diet) toavoid a sudden change of diet. Mastitis 142 As with any other infection, mastitis can cause the animals distress and suffering so you shouldtherefore control it. Despite the overall reduction inclinical mastitis, the level of environmental infectionhas hardly changed. Dairy producers should followthe Defra Mastitis Management Action Plan (MastitisMAP) which, together with good stockmanship andenvironmental management, will help you to controlmastitis infection. The Mastitis MAP covers: hygienic teat management (such as keeping the teats clean); promptly identifying and treating clinical cases; dry-cow management and therapy; accurate record keeping; culling of chronically infected cows; and regular milking-machine maintenance and testing. 35Dairy cowsSection 2 - Specific recommendations as it is a surgical procedure. You should not use this procedure on young, immature heifers and, in anycase, it should only be done rarely. Repeatedepidural injections are necessary for this procedureand they can cause welfare problems for the animals(such as severe pain in the tailhead and lower back). Ultrasound scanning 132 Ultrasound scanning through an animal 's rectum is an invasive procedure that needs skill andtraining on the operator 's part. The Veterinary Surgery (Rectal Ultrasound Scanning of Bovines)Order 2002 requires lay operators to have attendeda Defra approved training course, undertaken anumber of supervised scans and obtained a'certificate of exemption ' from Defra, before they can carry out the procedure. Bull pens 133 You should not neglect the welfare of bulls. Breeding bulls, where possible, should be kept withother stock, for example dry cows. Bull pens shouldbe sited to allow the bull to see and hear farmactivity. As a guide, accommodation for a singleadult bull of average size should include a sleepingarea of at least 16m 2. For bulls weighing over one tonne, the sleeping area should be at least 1m2for every 60 kg liveweight. If the bull is not regularlyand routinely exercised outside the bull pen - or ifyou use the bull pen as the service area - the penshould include an exercise area at least twice aslarge as the sleeping area. 134 You should have facilities in the pen and exercise area so that you can securely restrain thebull with a yoke or similar device. This is so that youcan carry out routine husbandry procedures (such ascleaning out the bull pen) and so that the bull canbe treated when required. 34Section 2 - Specific recommendationsA Defra publications related to cattle welfare as at March 2003 PB number Title 0409 Code of Practice - the welfare of animals in livestock markets 0621 Farm fires: advice on farm animal welfare 1147 Emergencies on livestock farms 1151 Lameness in beef cattle and dairy followers 1381 Guidance on the transport of casualty farm animals 2339 A short guide to the Dairy Products (Hygiene) Regulations for Dairy Farmers 2594 Explanatory guide to the Welfare of Animals (Slaughter or Killing) Regulations 1995 3335 Improving calf survival 3477 Welfare of red-meat animals at slaughter - pre-slaughter handling: a pocket guide 3478 Welfare of red-meat animals at slaughter - stunning and sticking: a pocket guide 3575 Assessment of practical experience in the handling, transport and care of animals: guide to employers 3766 Guidance on the Welfare of Animals (Transport) Order 1997 4020 Lameness in dairy cattle 4192 Identification of injurious weeds. 4516 TB in Cattle - reducing the risk 4661 Treatment and prevention of mastitis in dairy cows 6491 Condition scoring of beef suckler cows and heifers 6492 Condition scoring of dairy cows 7189 The Weeds Act 1959 - Preventing the spread of harmful weeds. 7190 The Weeds Act 1959 - Guidance note on the methods that can be used to control harmful weeds. 7350 Better biosecurity provides peace of mind, healthy stock and a more viable business. 37Useful publicationsAppendix You will find more information in Defra 's booklet, 'Treatment and prevention of mastitis in dairy cows ' (see the Appendix). Milking 143 You should never leave lactating dairy cows unmilked or with over-full udders. Anyone who milkscows - including relief milkers - should be fullycompetent to perform all milking procedures. Ideally,formal training should be given to milkers, whichwould include a period of full supervision bycompetent, trained operators. 144 A milking machine that is working properly is essential for: the cows ' comfort; optimum milking performance; and udder health. During each milking session, you should make simple checks (such as the working vacuum level) and carryout routine maintenance to make sure that themilking machine is working properly. 145 Where necessary, you should upgrade the milking machine so that there is no machine damagecaused to teats and that the cyclic vacuumfluctuations are within the recommended range. Youmay need specialist advice for this. 146 You should have new or refurbished installations independently tested to ensure correct operation inaccordance with manufacturer 's recommendations and those contained in the 'British Standard for milking machine installations ' (see the appendix). 147 Each year, a trained and competent operator should carry out at least one full working assessmentof the machinery, to ensure that it is operatingcorrectly and to make any necessary repairs oradjustments. 148 You should minimise the amount of time cows have to wait to be milked. The standings should belarge enough for the size of cattle being milked andfor cows to enter and leave the milking parlour easily,with a minimum of stress. The entrance and exitareas of the milking parlour, where animals will tendto collect, should be wide enough for the animals tomove easily on non-slip floors. 149 Where automatic backing gates are used in collection yards, they should be designed toencourage dairy cows to move towards the parlour,without causing them any distress. These gatesshould not be electrified. Robotic milkers 150 Robotic milkers offer the opportunity to make more efficient use of labour, but cannot replace goodstockmanship. At least twice daily, the robotic systemshould be assessed and the appropriate action takenin respect of: cows not attending the milking station; failed attachments; incomplete milkings; fall in milk yields; and alarms generated by various sensory equipment to detect conditions such as abnormal milk composition, including mastitis. 36Section 2 - Specific recommendations You can get copies of all these publications, free of charge, from: Defra Publications Admail E-mail: defra@iforcegroup.comWebsite: http://www.defra.gov.ukThese publications are updated regularly.
