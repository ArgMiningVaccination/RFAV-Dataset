To view the amendments, visit the section titled \" [Summary of Protocol Amendments](/products/vaccine-safety/research-protocol/#amendments).\" Background and Objectives for the Systematic Review Vaccines are considered one of the greatest public health achievements of the last century for their role in eradicating smallpox and controlling polio, measles, rubella, and other infectious diseases in the United States. [1](#ref1) Despite their effectiveness in preventing and eradicating disease, substantial gaps in vaccine uptake exist. Vaccination rates for young children are at an all-time high. [2](#ref2) However, vaccination rates remain well below established Healthy People 2020 targets for many vaccines recommended for adolescents, [3](#ref3) adults, [4](#ref4) and pregnant women. [5](#ref5) Increasing vaccination rates remains critically important, as vaccine-preventable diseases such as influenza, pertussis, and human papilloma virus (HPV)-associated cervical cancer continue to take a heavy toll despite the widespread availability of effective vaccines. The health and productivity costs of influenza infection alone in adults are have been estimated to be as high as $87 billion per year. [6](#ref6) The recent pertussis outbreaks in California, Washington, Minnesota, and Wisconsin highlight the importance of protecting vulnerable infants by vaccinating their pregnant mothers, caregivers, and other contacts. HPV is the most common sexually transmitted infection, affecting approximately 27 percent of U.S. women aged 14-59. HPV-16 and HPV-18\u2014the two strains covered by the HPV vaccine\u2014are thought to be responsible for approximately 70 percent of incident cervical cancer. Nationally, in 2005, there were nearly 12,000 new cases of cervical cancer reported, with 4,000 cervical cancer-related deaths. [7](#ref7) Despite the availability of an HPV vaccine that could prevent a substantial proportion of these cases of cervical cancer, completion of the three-dose series was only 34.8 percent among adolescent females in 2011. [3](#ref3) The shortfall in vaccination coverage rates is occurring in the context of a rapidly changing immunization schedule. The number of routine immunizations recommended for children (Table 1), adolescents (Table 1), adults (Table 2), and pregnant women (Table 3) has expanded considerably over the past 10 years. Since 2005, the routine adolescent vaccination schedule has grown to include these vaccines at ages 11 or 12 years: meningococcal conjugate vaccine; tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis (Tdap); HPV; and influenza (one dose annually). Pregnant women are now advised to receive Tdap vaccine during the second or third trimester of pregnancy to protect their newborns from pertussis. |Vaccine||Children| |DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis)||2 diphtheria, and older| |Vaccine||Adults| risk of hepatitis A infection| |Hepatitis B||All unvaccinated adults at risk for hepatitis B infection and all adults requesting protection from hepatitis B infection| |HPV (human papillomavirus)||Adults of meningococcal (MCV4 or MPS5 if younger than 55 years and younger with certain conditions, and all adults 65 years and older| |Td (tetanus, diphtheria)||All adults| old; some adults 65 years older| |Varicella||All adults without evidence of varicella trimester| |Td (tetanus, diphtheria)||Should be used if indicated| |Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis)||All pregnant women after the first trimester if indicated| As the number of recommended immunizations have expanded across the population, so too have concerns about the safety of vaccines, despite the rigorous processes new vaccines must undergo before receiving approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Vaccine development and commercialization are complex processes, and the regulatory review process is overseen by the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research of the FDA. [8](#ref8) Vaccines are unique when compared with many other drugs and medications because they are administered to a large population of mostly young healthy people to prevent rather than treat disease. Vaccines must meet stringent criteria for safety, efficacy, and potency. Preclinical studies are conducted in the early stages of vaccine development and are meant to be sufficient to rule out overt toxicity and identify potential toxic effects that might occur during the clinical trial. Once a vaccine is ready for clinical evaluation, an Investigational New Drug application must be submitted so that the FDA can monitor the safety of clinical trial subjects and ensure that the study design is appropriate to assess the vaccine's effectiveness and safety. The clinical evaluation of a vaccine typically consists of three phases. [8](#ref8) Phase I studies\u2014which typically enroll 20 to 80 subjects\u2014are designed to evaluate vaccine safety and tolerability and to generate preliminary immunogenicity data. Phase II studies evaluate the immunogenicity of the vaccine and provide preliminary estimates on the rates of common adverse events, typically enrolling several hundred subjects. Phase III trials provide the information on a vaccine's safety and effectiveness that is required to support licensure. After a vaccine is licensed and in use, multiple systems are in place to ensure ongoing assessments of safety, [9](#ref9) including postlicensure safety surveillance conducted by the FDA, [10](#ref10) the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), [11](#ref11) the Vaccine Safety Datalink, [12](#ref12) and the Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment Network. [13](#ref13) Despite the stringent regulation and evaluation of vaccines, concerns about vaccine safety continue to persist for the lay public. Perhaps the most highly publicized safety concern of the last 2 decades has been the link between autism and the MMR vaccine, first reported in The Lancet by Dr. Andrew Wakefield. [14](#ref14) Vaccination rates for measles, mumps, and rubella plummeted in the United Kingdom leading to measles outbreaks [15](#ref15) and concern about vaccines and autism spread globally. In 2010, The Lancet fully retracted the 1998 publication, [16](#ref16) noting that elements of the manuscript had been deliberately falsified. Subsequently, Dr. Wakefield was barred from practicing medicine in the United Kingdom. Although multiple large studies have confirmed the lack of association between MMR and autism, parental worries about the safety of the vaccine persist. In addition to autism, other parental concerns about childhood vaccines include links to multiple sclerosis, sudden infant death syndrome, asthma, and diabetes. [17](#ref17) Though no systematic data exist on the safety concerns of pregnant women, this is likely to be an active focus given the relatively recent introduction of the recommendation to administer the Tdap vaccine during pregnancy. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) has requested an evidence report on the safety of vaccines used for routine immunization of adults (including pregnant women) and children that will, based on a comprehensive and systematic review of the scientific literature, describe associations between vaccines and adverse events (AEs) and help to outline the gaps in evidence. This report focuses on the AEs potentially associated with vaccines as opposed to the benefits, as all of these vaccines are already recommended. Our work will expand the consensus report Adverse Effects of Vaccines: Evidence and Causality, which was published by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) in 2011. This report evaluated the scientific evidence for event-vaccine relationships and covered many vaccines included in current recommended immunization schedules (varicella, influenza, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, HPV, MMR, meningococcal, tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis) in the United States. Our work will build upon the IOM report in a number of important ways. In addition to those vaccines covered by the IOM report, our systematic review will also cover the pneumococcal, rotavirus, Haemophilus influenzae type b, inactivated poliovirus, and zoster vaccines. We will use the existing IOM bibliography as a springboard and will update the literature search with more recent studies and include original searches for the vaccines recommended for adults, children, and pregnant women that are not included in the IOM report. We provide an assessment of AEs for all vaccines and include searches for studies that address the severity of, relative risk for, and risk factors for each AE type. Appendix A contains an extensive list of potential AEs by vaccine; our methods are summarized below.

Analytic Framework The analytic framework for the project is displayed in the figure below. Vaccinations recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 2011 are listed in the large oval. Various subsets are administered annually to children, adolescents, and adults, including pregnant women (next circle), according to a schedule developed by ACIP. Both patient factors (i.e., age and race) and vaccine factors (i.e., formulation, dosage, and timing) may be risk factors for potential AEs associated with vaccination. Abbreviations: Hep A = hepatitis A; Hep rubella Methods A. Criteria for Inclusion/Exclusion of Studies in the Review The following publication types / studies will be excluded: - Letters - Editorials - Individual case reports - Animal studies - Mechanistic/in vitro (animal or human) studies; we will include an appendix summarizing potential biological mechanisms - Studies of vaccines not on the recommended 2011 schedules, including brands/formulations not available in the United States - Non-English-language studies - Studies not reporting or mentioning AEs The following types of studies will be included: - All other studies that compare AEs between a vaccinated group and an unvaccinated control or comparison group - Multivariate analysis for risk factors (no unvaccinated group necessary, but must control for multiple factors in a regression analysis) - Vaccination with high-dose influenza vaccine versus another dose in elderly adults - Vaccination of pregnant women versus a nonpregnant group - Interdermal versus intramuscular administration of influenza vaccine - Studies of vaccines that do not have an unvaccinated group for ethical reasons (i.e., testing a new product against the vaccination that is licensed/in use), such as: - Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine 7 (PCV7) - Inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) versus oral polio vaccine (OPV) - Live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) versus trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) - Tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) versus tetanus and diphtheria (Td) - Meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MCV4) versus meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine 5 (MPS5) There will be no limitations regarding publication date. B. Development of the Search Strategy: Searching for the Evidence Keyword Searches Our search strategy will build upon the recent IOM report for the eight vaccines contained therein. Using the IOM keyword search strategy, we will update their searches on varicella, influenza, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, HPV, MMR, meningococcus, diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus to identify more recently published studies. The following structure was used in the IOM keyword search strategy: \"vaccine term\" AND \"health term,\" where vaccine terms include the technical vaccine name, general descriptions of the vaccine of interest (e.g., rotavirus AND vaccine), or manufacturer names; health terms include a list of AEs potentially associated with the vaccine. Because our focus is on AEs in general, we will add more general AE keywords to the list of health terms such as \"safe\" or \"safety\" or \"side effect\" or \"harm.\" We are not including minor AEs such as crying, fever, injection site tenderness, et cetera. Using the same approach, we will develop new search strategies for the vaccines not originally included in the IOM report: pneumococcal, rotavirus, H. influenzae type b, inactivated poliovirus, and zoster. In addition to using broad terms such as \"safety\" to identify studies assessing AEs, we will use keyword search terms for specific AEs. Preliminary searches will be based on AEs reported in systems just as VCIP, VAERS, and the FDA's Mini-Sentinel Program. Input from the Technical Expert Panel (TEP) was used to identify additional AEs of interest. The detailed search strategy, as well as a list of potential AEs for each vaccine, is included as Appendix A. Data Sources The following databases will be used to conduct searches and identify relevant studies: DARE, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, CENTRAL, PubMed, CINAHL, and TOXFILE Procs for SAS. [23](#ref23) Unless statistical power is adequate, subgroup analyses will be narrative in order to be able to make comparisons between study designs and other variables in the heterogeneous dataset. Further input about effect modifiers and pertinent subgroups has been discussed with a local content expert and the TEP. (See the comparisons listed under Criteria for Inclusion/Exclusion of Studies in the Review.) Multiple publications of the same study will be noted but counted (and extracted, assessed for quality, and analyzed) as one study to ensure that the same participants do not enter the analyses multiple times. Multiple publications are defined by the investigated patients. F. Assessing Strength of Evidence: Grading the Strength of Evidence for Individual Outcomes We will assess the overall strength of evidence by using guidance suggested by AHRQ for its Effective Health Care Program. [24](#ref24) This method is based loosely on one developed by the GRADE Working Group [25](#ref25) and classifies the grade of evidence according to the following criteria: High = High confidence that the evidence reflects the true effect. Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect. Moderate = Moderate confidence that the evidence reflects the true effect. Further research may change our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate. Low = Low confidence that the evidence reflects the true effect. Further research is likely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate. Insufficient = Evidence either is unavailable or does not permit a conclusion. The evidence grade is based on four primary (required) domains and four optional domains. The required domains are risk of bias, consistency, directness, and precision; the additional domains are dose-response, plausible confounders that would decrease the observed effect, strength of association, and publication bias. G. Assessing Applicability Applicability refers to the extent to which the effects observed in published studies are likely to reflect the expected results when a specific intervention (i.e., vaccination) is applied to the population of interest under \"real-world\" conditions. Relatively few clinical trials are designed with applicability in mind; furthermore, they sometimes report only a few of the factors needed to fully assess applicability. Thus, we are including observational studies that contain an unvaccinated control/comparison group such as population surveillance, retrospective and prospective cohorts, and analyses of administrative databases. Defining the populations, interventions, timing, and outcomes (as described in the KQs and analytic framework) inevitably takes into account factors that may affect the applicability of studies. Reviewers will abstract this information and consider it in summarizing the applicability and limitations of the evidence. Evidence tables will clearly distinguish studies designed to assess effectiveness versus those designed specifically to assess safety. To make applicability information useful, the review will address how specific aspects of study design affected the final population and how greatly (and in which direction) it may differ from more representative populations in practice.
