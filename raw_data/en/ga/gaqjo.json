Meeting The Need 5 Meeting the Need (1) Provide the mission and vision for the proposed school and briefly describe how they serve as the foundation for the proposed school, including: Mission: The Village High School (TVHS) transforms the lives of graduates by offering a high -quality education in conjunction with coping, decision -making, and practical life skills that lead to grit and perseverance , and better understanding of what it takes to be successful in the world. TVHS' s culture will create a safe space for all students, including LGBTQ+ students and their allies. Vision: We are a charter school that is committed to creating and sustaining an exceptional education for students whos e needs cannot be met in traditional environments. TVHS's mission and vision consist of five core beliefs: 1. Students cannot learn if they do not feel safe.12 2. Many students are in desperate need of counseling and mental health services at school.3 3. Formative assessment and data drive instruction. 4. High quality teachers, curriculum, student engagement, and materials increase student growth. 5. Professional development that is focused and thoughtful is vital to the success of the school. TVHS proposes to give families the ability to attend a quality high school in which students feel in charge of their learning, safety , and mental health. O ur unique model will transform education for diverse and traditionally underserved student populations. (a) The key components of your educational model . The key components for TVHS's model is to provide a rigorous, innovative, and hands -on core curriculum. Based on the constructivist view of learning, TVHS's model encourages students to use real- world problem solving to create knowledge and reflect and discuss their understanding.4 TVHS will provide specialty elective programs in social -emotional learning, and high -level technology certification programs in piloting drones and cybersecurity. TVHS will incorporate the Summit Learning Curriculum for core classes including English, Math, Science, Social Studies. Summit Learning is a research -based approach designed to drive student engagement, meaningful learning, and strong student- teacher relationships that prepare students 1 GLSEN . (2019).

Constructivist Learning Theory. Retrieved from https://educationaltechnology.net/constructivist- learning -theory/ Meeting The Need 6 for life beyond the classroom.5 The Summit Lea rning program offers schools customizable curriculum, a range of educational resources and technology tools, professional development for educators, ongoing coaching, and support for schools. Students learn from teachers through whole group, small group, a nd one -on-one instruction . Project -based and group learning allow teachers the opportunity to demonstrate for students the application of life -long learning skills via team collaboration, data interpretation, and persuasive arguments. The curriculum largel y centers on real world projects allowing s tudents to connect what they are learning to life beyond the classroom. Classroom teachers will mentor students weekly during dedicated one -on-one sessions. During these mentoring sessions students will set long and short -term goals. These sessions will foster strong relationships between students and mentors as they celebrate successes and discuss learning opportunities from roadblocks they need to overcome. Electives use the Stretch, Enliven, Ennoble, Discover ( SEED) Impact Program , a program that focuses on internal growth utilizing Social Emotional Learning (SEL). SEED Impact is defined as: Stretch an individual's views of what's possible Enliven an individual's work with more of what you do best Ennoble more creative hands in the work, an d Discover maximum performance and impact. SEL intentionally develops attitudes, behaviors, and skills that are fundamental for academic and life success. SEL programming incorporates two essential benefits:6 (1) encouragement of positive, strength -based behaviors, integrated as norm s for lifetime practice and (2) d iscourages negative behaviors. Educators, policymakers, and employers, alike, believe that SEL is key to optimizing education and training. Working in partnership with the stage -model framework, SEED Impact, will be customized and integrated into the school to measure, credibly report, and accelerate the lear ning experience of program participants. With a focus on life -transformations, the SEED Impact approach tracks major shifts in competency measured across three domains of growth /competency ladders : Being (comfort with self) Doing (aptitude with new skill s) Relating (interpersonal relationships) SEED Impact will guide TVHS's leadership team to customize these three competency ladders to clarify core SEL practices in alignment with our mission and most -desired outcomes. At the start and end of each school year, the staff will use the competency ladders to assess each learner's performance. Learners will also self -assess their experience. Combining these two complementary survey tools strengthens the validity and reliability of the measurement with SEED Impact and amplifies the benefits derived by each participant. 5 Summit Learning. (n.d.). What is Summit Learning? Retrieved from https://www.summitlearning.org/approach/learning -experience 6 SEED Impact. (n.d.). Social Emotional Learning. Retrieved from https://www.seedimpact.org/social - emotional -learning Meeting The Need 7 In customizing the assessments, SEED Impact will build on the tools, research, and reporting TVHS has already completed in this area. The intent is to simplify and reduce the work on TVHS's staff as SEED Impact guides to effectively implement this advanced approach to SEL measurement and accelerated learner growth. Once tools are refined and made operational, SEED Impact will provide data analysis and a dynamic report reflecting the SEED Impact brand and tailored for specific audiences as requested by the organization. Overall, S EED Impact will be equipped to report the impacts that most powerfully capture its work while generating actionable data to guide learners to increasingly higher levels of competency. Integrating this approach increase s self-reflection and amplifies the students' learning experiences . Staff, instructors, and students will come to share a common, clarifying language that enables the learner to understand \"where I am\" in my personal growth, in relation to \"where I want to be\" and \"what I can do next to grow into mor e of my potential.\" The goal is r ecognition and celebration of student success to ignite deeper learning. Findings will include: \u00b7 Percent SEL gains by participant, cohorts, and subgroup. \u00b7 Distribution of competency levels. \u00b7 Narrative accounts supporting and enriching these data. \u00b7 Summary ratings of the core practices . \u00b7 Correlation of the results from the ladder ratings and self -assessments . \u00b7 Suggested strategies for accelerating growth in SEL. Working closely with SEED Impact to launch these SEL tools for strategic learning and outcome measurement, our program will gain: \u00b7 Streamlined data collection - reducing the work required of staff and volunteers. \u00b7 Ability to blend numbers and narratives in compelling reports that credibly convey the fullness of our program's life -changing results . \u00b7 Baseline data to inform program enhancements and against which to track gains. \u00b7 Ability to compare across cohorts and time periods, and tally results across the organization. \u00b7 Ability to causally link the benefits of participating in our program to successes in school home , and employment, as SEL benefits translate across environments. Between program experiences, participants can be challenged to reference the three ladders to accelerate their SEL growth. SEED Impact will support our staff to guide participant self -reflection on the similarities and differences between the stages reached on each ladder with the next -higher stages. Learners will identify skills and behaviors from higher stages to mirror, and then throughout the year practice, journal, and report on their successes. This reflection can be incorporated in student learnin g plans. Learners will enter the next program experience with heightened SEL competencies on which to build. We will gain holistic, rather than piecemeal reporting of results, grounded in SEL research. Our work with SEED Impact is less about evaluation and more about the opportunity for staff, leaders, student s, parents, and funders to apprehend the power of our school . In addition to SEED Impact, TVHS supplement the SEL curriculum using the Goodlife Curriculum. Finally, TVHS will implement the suicide prevention program, Reach In University. This program will be available to all students and staff, and the courses will serve as elective credit . An additional piece of TVHS' s model is the technology component, GRADD.co , NVBAA, and Cyberjutsu. GRA DD.co provides the software expertise and training to create highly accurate 3D models through drone flying, virtual and augmented reality , which is the world's fastest Meeting The Need 8 photogrammetry software .7 The Nevada Business Aviation Association (NVBAA) promotes aviation by developing and offering STEM education curriculum and by providing workforce training programs.8 Participants in the FAA Part 107 Remote Pilot Training program will receive industry leading instruction to prepare for the exam. We have partnered with the Women's Society of Cyberjutsu (WSC), to create a unique and rigorous Cybersecurity curriculum. WSC serves thousands of women, men, and girls across the globe by bringing awareness to, and advancing careers in, cybersecurity.9 The WSC community includes information security profession als, IT professionals, programmers, computer scientists and engineers, as well as women wanting to explore and join the field. Recognizing the importance of encouraging girls to embrace a future in STEM -related professions through its Cyberjutsu Girls Acad emy, WSC provides a unique hands -on curriculum focused on securing information technology. WSC's mission is to advance women in cybersecurity careers by providing programs and partnerships that promote hands -on training, networking, education, mentoring, resource -sharing and other professional opportunities. We envision a cyber -community where all students can reach their full potential & thrive with unlimited opportunit ies. (b) The outcomes you expect to achieve. TVHS plans to achieve the mission and vision through a rigorous, project -based core curriculum, weekly focus on social -emotional learning and self- care, one -to-one mentoring, while creating a sense of community and service among students and staff. TVHS believes this culture will also increase academic achievement and success after graduation. As a school, TVHS is committed to achieving the following outcomes and academic goals. \u00b7 A safe space and accepting culture for all students to grow, learn, and achieve their highest potential . \u00b7 A rigorous, hands -on core curriculum with exceptional and trained educators and professionals . \u00b7 Weekly focus on social -emotional learning, s elf-care, and mentoring. \u00b7 Creating opportunities for students to be leaders within the school and community . \u00b7 Establi shing partnerships with institutions of higher education and business professional s to create oppo rtunities outside of the school. \u00b7 Meets or exceeds the average student academic performance of the local district . \u00b7 in all required state accountability tests, WIDA/CRT Science/EOC/NAA/ACT . TVHS expect s that each student will graduate with a 21st Century College and Career ready diploma10 and the grit and perseverance to be a contributing member of society. TVHS also offers students the ability to obtain a license from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to fly and maintain drones, as well as the ability to be certified in Cybersecurity. This will allow students to either attend a college, university, or technology school upon graduation and/or use their certification to immediately access the workforce regardless of the path a student chooses . TVHS graduates will have qualities and abilities that will set them apart from other graduates. 7 GRAD D. (2021). Retrieved from https://gradd.co/ 8 Nevada Business Aviation Association. (2021).

The r emainder of the distribution is White 27%, Black /African American 21% , and Asian/Pacific Islander at 6%. These findings show a diverse population that is encompassing a variety of needs. Upon examining the educational needs of the students in the surrounding area, and then reviewing the NEPF Star ratings of the high schools in the focus areas, there is a need for the community to have access to a high school that can provide all the students with opportunity and a quality education.19 (a) Academic Needs: Applicants meeting this need will propose a school model that includes demonstrated capacity, credible plans, and thorough research and analysis in order to intentionally provide acc ess to 3, 4 and 5 -Star schools in zip codes where students are attending a 1 - or 2 -Star school. A map and list of zip codes will be provided; SPCSA charter schools will be removed from the data set used to identify zip codes. The grade levels served are 9-10 , starting F all 2022 -2023 with 3 25 stude nts. The first year, 2022 - 2023, the breakdown will be 175 students for grade 9 and 150 students for grade 10 . The second year, 2023 -2024 with a student breakdown of 200 /175/150 and a student population of 5 25 students. In year three, 2024 -2025 with a student breakdown of 200/200/175/150 and a student population of 725 students. In year four, 2025 -2026 with a student breakdown of 200/200/200/175 and a student population of 775 students. Finally, maxing out the student population during year five 2026 -2027 with a breakdown of 200/200/200/200 and a student population of 800 students. TVHS's first graduating class will be May 202 5.

The enrollment of students at those 1 -2 star middle and high schools is approximately 16,125 students, who currently attend underperforming schools. These schools struggle with irregular attendance, behavior issues, and poverty. During the 2019 -2020 school year, the average graduation rate for all five high schools , that f all into the 1- 2 star ranking , was 76%, this means only 76 out of every 100 students is graduating from these underperforming schools. There was a 90% average attendance rate, which was 4% under the average Nevada Attendance rate of 94%. The chronic absenteeism percentage for 2018 -2019 was 21.9%, while the state average was 18.8%.21 TVHS b elieves that with its model, it will get students interested and motivated to come to school each day.

This is the number one issue that TVHS is looking to change. Overall results for the social emotional learning are in the low 70% for all 5 schools, out of a 100% scale. SEL refers to the process through which children and adults acquire and apply the knowledge, attitudes, and skills necessary to manage emotions; maintain positive relationships and make responsible decisions. SEL is fundamental not only to children's social emotional development but also their health, ethical development, citizenship, motivation to achieve, and academic learning. TVHS has adopted the SEED Impact program to measure and grow each student's social emotional learning through an exceptional curriculum, peer mentoring , and SEL growth assessments. The amount of violence and the use of weapons and drugs on campus at the high schools in these areas is a safety concern. During the 2019 -2020 school year, there were a total of 548 incidents of violence, weapons, or drugs reported at Cheyenne HS, Delta Academy HS, Desert Rose HS, Mojave HS, and Somerset Losee alone. Mojave HS had the highest number of reported incidents and the most incidents involving a weapon. Based on The Nevada School Climate and Social Emotional Survey 2019 -2020 23, all five schools wi thin the targeted zip codes hold the highest number of incidents in the same three categories; violence to other students, possession or use of a controlled substance, and bullying. A ccording to the fall 2019 survey, all five CCSD schools are hovering just above least favorable conditions for physical and emotional safety, with scores at 300 -340 out of a maximum score of 500. The mission of the SPCSA is \"to sponsor, support, and oversee dynamic and responsive public charter schools that prepare all studen ts for academic, social, and economic success,\" and TVHS 's culture and programs will accomplish those goals. The reported numbers for violence, substance misuse/abuse, and bullying are alarming. TVHS will address these needs via its curriculum , mentoring program , and community resources. Examples by which these issues will be addressed are (1) Life Skills Training ( LST) reduces alcohol, marijuana, and tobacco use by 50 -75%; (2) Big Brothers & Big Sisters has a 77% success rate for reducing antisocial behavior; (3) Teen Court Models are proven to reduce delinquency, crime, and violence, as well as having a Peer Led Disciplinary Board in partnership with the Clark County Law Foundation; Peer Counseling etc.; and (4) LIFT - Linking the Interests of Families and Teachers .

Models may include but are not limited to programs designed for student groups that are most at -risk of dropping out or programs aimed at enabling credit -deficient students to get back on track to graduate. Applicants should demonstrate a strong understanding of grade -level appropriate indicators for successful high school completion, such as early litera cy, attendance, and credit sufficiency and plans to enable students to successfully meet these milestones. The term at -risk is often used to describe students or groups of students who are considered to have a higher probability of failing academically or dropping out of school. This term may be applied to students who face circumstances that could jeopardize their ability to complete school, such as homelessness, incarceration, teenage pregnancy, serious health issues, domestic violence, transiency, or other conditions . It may also refer to learning disabilities, low test scores, disciplinary problems, grade retentions, or other learning -related factors that could adversely affect the educational performance and attainment of some students. While educators often use the term at - risk to refer to general populations or categories of students, they may also apply the term to individual students who have raised concerns \u2014based on specific behaviors observed over time \u2014 that indicate they are more likely to fail or drop out. To be proactive, TVHS will be using three main programs to help students be successful in school and in life. Response to Intervention (RTI), Summit Learning Mentoring Program, and SEED Impact SEL Assessments. 1. Response to Intervention (RTI): a multi- tier approach to the early identification and support of students with learning and behavior needs. The RTI process begins with high - quality instruction and universal screening of all children in the general education classroom.25 The tiers of the RTI Processes are: a. Tier 1 Interventions - classroom intervention, screening assessment, differentiated instruction by developmental level and learning style b. Tier 2 Interventions - small group targeted interventions c. Tier 3 Interventions - individualized, intensive instruction a nd intervention Research has shown that between 5 -10% of the student body will r equire Tier 2 interventions and 1-5% will require Tier 3 interventions. 2. Summit Learning Mentorship: In addition to classroom instruction, teachers also mentor students during dedicated weekly one- on-one meetings. With their mentors, students set long- and short -term goals, and discuss both their academic and emotional experiences 25 RTI Action Network . (2021). RTI in Secondary Schools. Retrived from http://www.rtinetwork.org/learn/rti -in-secondary -schools Meeting The Need 23 while working toward these goals. Mentoring sessions build strong relationships between students and their mentors. Together, they celebrate successes, discuss reasons for roadblocks, and talk about areas of learning opportunity. Mentors will demonstrate a strong understanding of grade -level appropriate indicators for successful high school completion, such as early literacy, attendance, credit sufficiency , and plans to enable students to successfully meet these milestones.26 3. SEED Impact: Working in partnership with SEED Impact, a stage- model framework, the SEED Impact Competency Ladders, will be customized, and integrated with TVHS programming to measure, credibly report, and accelerate the learning experience of TVHS's students . SEED Imp act will guide TVHS's leadership team to customize three competency ladders (being, doing and relating) and clarify core SEL practices in alignment with its mission and most -desired program outcomes. At the start and end of each program year, program staff will use the competency ladders to assess each learner's performance. Learners will self -assess their experience as well. Combining these two complement ary survey tools strengthens the validity and reliability of the measurement, amplif ying the benefits derived by each participant.27 In customizing the assessments, we will build on the tools, research, and reporting what the organization has already done in this area. The intent is to simplify and reduce the workload on the staff as SEED Impact guides us to effectively implement this advanced approach to SEL measurement and accelerated learner growth. PARENT AND COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT (1) Describe the role to date of any parents, neighborhood, and/or community members involved in the development of the proposed school.

TVHS believes in the equity of measurable and ascertainable curriculum for all levels of students. The curriculum evaluation process will be led by a team of teachers, instructional coaches, and administrators who will evaluate and test the relevance and effec tiveness of the curriculum on a regular basis through assessments. TVHS will align its curriculum with the Nevada Academic Content Standards (NVACS) . The team will collect teacher feedback and student data from NWEA MAP, state assessment data, SEL data, and internally created assessments. Data Days will be held monthly to provide teachers with continuous ongoing professional development. This will provide an opportunity to discuss and analyze student data and plan for instruction and lesson implementation.

(3) Describe the distinguishing features of your school, including programming and curricular choices that make your school unique. For each feature, describe how it will be implemented. Key features may include: (a) Programs (e.g., curriculum, PD, afterschool program, parent program, etc.) All instruction will be based on the Nevada Academic Content Standards (NVACS) and the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) .30 TVHS will incorporate the Summit Learning Curriculum for core curriculum classes. These classes include English, Math, Science, Social Studies. Summit Learning is a research -based approach to education designed to drive student engagement, meaningful learning, and strong student -teacher relationships that prepare students for life beyond the classroom. The Summit Learning program offers schools customizable curriculum , a range of educational resources and technology tools, professional development for educators, ongoing coaching, and support for schools. Students learn from teachers through whole group, small group, and one -on-one time. Project -based and group learning allow teachers the opportunity to demonstrate for students the application of life -long learning skills via team collaboration, data interpretation, and persuasive arguments. The curriculum largely centers on real world related pr ojects. Students connect what they are learning to life beyond the classroom.31 Classroom teachers will also mentor students weekly during dedicated one- on-one sessions. During these mentoring sessions students will set long and short -term goals with their mentor. These sessions will foster strong relationships between students and mentors as they celebrate successes and discuss learning opportunities from roadblocks they need to overcome. 30 State of Nevada Department of Education.

What is Summit Learning? https://www.summitlearning.org/approach/learning - experience Academic Plan 46 The TVHS elective choice for our secondary programming is the SEED Impact Program. SEED Impact is a program that focuses on internal growth utilizing Social Emotional Learning (SEL). SEL intentionally develops attitudes, behaviors, and skills that are fundamental for academic and life success. SEL programming incorporates two essential benefits:32 (1) encouragement of positive, strength -based behaviors, integrated as norms for lifetime practice and (2) d iscourage negative behaviors . Educators, policymakers, and employers, alike, believe that SEL is key to optimizing education and training. Working in partnership with the stage -model framework, SEED Impact, will be customized and integrated with our programming to measure, credibly report, and accelerate the learning experience of program participants. With a focus on life -transfo rmations, SEED Impact's approach tracks major shifts in competency measured across three domains of growth : Being (comfort with self), Doing (aptitude with new skills), and Relating (interpersonal relationships). These will be used to clarify core SEL prac tices in alignment with TVHS's mission and most -desired program outcomes. At the start and end of each program year, program staff will use the competency ladders to assess each learner's performance. Learners will also self -assess their experience. Com bining these two complementary survey tools thus strengthens the validity and reliability of the measurement with SEED Impact and amplifies the benefits derived by each participant. In customizing the assessments, SEED Impact will build on the tools, rese arch, and reporting TVHS has already completed in this area. The intent is to simplify and reduce the work on TVHS's staff as SEED Impact guides to effectively implement this advanced approach to SEL measurement and accelerated learner growth. Once tools are refined and made operational, SEED Impact will provide data analysis and a dynamic report reflecting the SEED Impact brand and tailored for specific audiences as requested by the organization. Overall, Seed Impact will be equipped to report the impacts that most powerfully capture its work while generating actionable data to guide learners to increasingly higher levels of competency. The integration of this approach within programming will afford increased self -reflection and exemplify the experience of our program as a learning community. Staff, instructors, and participants will come to share a common, clarifying language that enables the learner to understand \"where I am\" in my personal growth, in relation to \"where I want to be\" and \"what I can do next to grow into more of my potential.\" Recognition and celebration of student successes will ignite deeper learning. Overall, SEED Impact's approach provides an integrated \"mental map\" of the entire program's landscape, and a concise way to portray and talk internally and externally about the program. TVHS will gain holistic rather than piecemeal reporting of results, grounded in SEL research. The work with SEED Impact is less about evaluation and more about the opportunity for staff, leaders, participants, parents, and funders to apprehend the power of its program. As more of 32 SEED Impact. (n.d.). Social Emotional Learning. https://www.seedimpact.org/social -emotional -learning Academic Plan 47 the programs are implement ed over time, TVHS will share common language and a unifying framework. SEED Impact reports will combine impact data with stories and photos to convey how each program and the organization is changing lives. An innovative element of TVHS's Model is the technology component, GRADD.co , Nevada Business Aviation Association ( NVBAA), and Cyberjutsu. GRADD.co provides the software expertise and training to create highly accurate 3D models through drone flying, virtual reality and augmented reality. It is the world's fastest photogrammetry software.33 NVBAA promotes aviation by developing and offering a STEM ed ucation curriculum and by providing workforce training programs.34 Participants in the FAA Part 107 Remote Pilot Training will receive industry leading instruction to prepare for the exam. We have partnered with the Women's Society of Cyberjutsu (WSC), to create a unique and rigorous Cybersecurity curriculum.35 WSC serves thousands of women, men, and girls across the globe by bringing awareness to, and advancing careers in, cybersecurity. The WSC community includes information security professionals, IT pro fessionals, programmers, computer scientists and engineers, as well as women wanting to explore and join the field. Recognizing the importance of encouraging girls to embrace a future in STEM -related professions through its Cyberjutsu Girls Academy, WSC pr ovides a unique hands -on curriculum focused on securing information technology. WSC's mission is to advance women in cybersecurity careers by providing programs and partnerships that promote hands -on training, networking, education, mentoring, resource- sharing and other professional opportunities. We envision a cyber - community where all students can reach their full potential & thrive with unlimited opportunity. \u00b7 Blended Learning Programs will help to support core instruction. Summit Learning, Google Class room, GRADD.co, and Cyberjutsu will be used. \u00b7 \"Data Days\" will be held monthly to provide teachers with continuous ongoing professional \u00b7 development. This will provide an opportunity to discuss and analyze student data and plan for instruction and lesson implementation.

Between program experiences, participants can be challenged to reference the three ladders (being, doing, relating) to accelerate their SEL growth. SEED Impact will support TVHS's staff to guide participant self -reflection on contrasts between the stages reached on each ladder with the next - higher stages. Learners will identify skills and behaviors from higher stages to mirror, and then throughout the year practice, journal, and report on their successes. This reflection can be incorporated in participant learning plans. Learners will enter the next program experience with heightened SEL competencies on which to build. GRADD.CO/NVBAA/Cyberjutsu student outcome findings will include obtaining a certification in the selected pathway area, c ontinuing to CSN through the dual enrollment option , and g aining employment after graduation . (5) Are there any portions of an existing network or school's model that you will utilize in this proposed school? If so, please identify and describe the student performance results of that particular programming. Portions of TVHS's model will include Summit Learning and SEED Impact. Summit Learning provides the core curriculum classes in English, Mathematics, Science, and Social Studies. Summit Learning is a research -based approach to education designed to drive student engagement, meaningful learning, and strong student -teacher relationships that prepare students for life beyond the classroom. The Summit Learning program offers schools customizable curriculum, a range of educational resources and technology tools, professional development for educators, ongoi ng coaching, and support for schools. Students learn from teachers through whole groups, small groups, and one -on-one time. Project- based and group learning allow teachers the opportunity to demonstrate for students the application of life -long learning sk ills via team collaboration, data interpretation, and persuasive arguments. Schools who have implemented Summit Learning curriculum have seen changes in student behavior and student achievement. For example, after year one of implementation, a school in Roanoke, Alabama which serves 530 students, experienced a 63% decrease in discipline referrals compared to previous years, and have seen an increase in ACT Aspire testing improve 28 points in writing.38 By 2018 -2019 school year, approximately 400 schools nat ionwide use d Summit Learning, which include d nearly 72,000 students and 3,800 educators.39 SEED Impact is another program that will be used in TVHS's model. The TVHS elective choice for our secondary programming is the SEED Impact Program. SEED Impact is a program that focuses on internal growth utilizing Social Emotional Learning (SEL). SEL intentionally develops attitudes, behaviors, and skills that are fundamental for academic and life success. SEL programming incorporates two essential benefits:40 (1) encouragement of positive, strength -based behaviors, 38 Summit Learning.

Educators, policymakers, and employers, alike, believe that SEL is key to o ptimizing education and training. Working in partnership with the stage -model framework, SEED Impact, will be customized and integrated with our programming to measure, credibly report, and accelerate the learning experience of program participants. With a focus on life- transformations, SEED Impact's approach tracks major shifts in competency measured across the three domains of growth . Research has shown that after three and a half years of SEL intervention, academic performance of students scored 13% h igher than those not exposed to SEL interventions.41 Implementing an SEL program and assessment tool like SEED Impact , schools improved in student performance. Based on Casel.org, 27% more students would improve in academic performance, 57% more would gain in their skill levels, 24% more would improve social behaviors and lower levels of distress, 23% more would improve attitudes, and 22% more would show fewer discipline problems.42 CURRICULUM & INSTRUCTIONAL DESIGN (1) In accordance with NRS 388A.246 , provide a description of the proposed instructional design of the charter school and the type of learning environment the charter school will provide, including, without limitation, whether the charter school will provide a program of distance education, the planned class size and structure, the proposed curriculum for the charter school and the teaching methods that will be used at the charter school.

The founders of TVHS believe that the school must incorporate specific instructional strategies in each classroom, in addition to differentiated instructional techniques in the core curriculum, to achieve the school's mission. TVHS teachers will develop thematic lessons to provide real -world experiences to core subject matter while addressing rigorous content and key areas of the curriculum in alignment with N VACS. TVHS will actively seek and encourage both parental and community involvement in the school's programs to empower students to continuously strive for academic and personal success. The program will promote higher levels of student engagement in the curriculum through mentoring opportunities, community service projects, project -based projects, and one-to-one mentoring allowing for students to build positive relationships with their peers, teachers, and their community. Emphasizing specific standard s-based measures of performance, TVHS will set high expectations for all students through standards -based instruction which incorporates opportunities for active and genuine relationships among students, families, a nd community mentors within the social emotional learning model to create richer learning communities that hold all stakeholders accountable for success. 41 Casel.org.

The grade- specific standards will define end -of-year expectations and a cumulative progression to enable students to meet college and career readiness. The ELA Standards (strands in Reading, Writing, Speaking & Listening, and Language) and Literacy standards will emphasize reading, writing, speaking, listening, and language in History /Social Science, Science and Technical Subjects. The Stan dards for Mathematical Practice and Content will guide teachers to prepare students with the mathematical skills necessary for success in college and future careers. 45 Curriculum Delivery: TVHS will provide professional development planning opportunities and resources for teachers to develop lessons that incorporate the N VACS while engaging students through project based related activities. As teachers build on interdisciplinary connections under project -based learning, it is expected that students will naturally begin to link information between and among courses, increasing the relevancy of skills and content in such courses. The expectation is that teachers work cooperatively through hori zontal and vertical planning opportunities using the s tandards to develop lessons and projects throughout the school year.46 Curriculum Support: TVHS's educational program is founded on the principle that students will be fully engaged in the curriculum and thereby be academically successful.47 All students will be engaged in, and benefit from, the curriculum including students with special needs, EL students, and students who may enter below grade level. After school activities, quarterly guest speakers within academy strands, participation in school sponsored events, internship, and volunteer opportunities with school partners will provide students with opportunities to 45 State of Nevada Department of Education.

Faculty will differentiate instruction for students, as well as offer tutoring services or other such assistance to ensure students remain successful . (2) Describe the instructional strategies that you will implement to support the educa tion plan and why they are well suited for the anticipated student population. Outline the data, methods, and systems teachers will use to provide differentiated instruction to all students. Teachers will be using explicit instruction to deliver content. In addition to project -based learning, explicit instruction is an evidence -based practice that is effective because it reduces cognitive load.48 Learning new concepts or topics can put stress on students who do not have the prerequisite knowledge and skills necessary to perform at grade level. Instruction will be focused on critical content that are aligned with the NVACS so that students can develop a deep understanding of the concepts and skills needed for success. Instructional practices should focus o n purpose and intentionality, and not on quantity.2 The goal is to help teachers gain a better understanding by learning through the eyes of students. Here are instructional practices that will be modeled at TVHS.49 \u00b7 Teacher Clarity - teachers will clarify purpose and learning targets with students by providing an explicit criterion on how students can meet success. Models or examples will be presented so that students understand what the expectations are and what the end project/product looks like. \u00b7 Classroom Discussion - teachers will facilitate class discussions. This will allow students to learn from one another and provides an opportunity for teachers to assess through observation on how well students are learning new concepts and get insight on m isconceptions that need to be addressed. \u00b7 Feedback - steady and consistent feedback (written or verbal) are critical in providing areas of growth and need. Along with individual feedback, small- group and/or whole groups allow for two -way communication by pr oviding feedback to the teacher for adjustments in the learning process and instruction. \u00b7 Formative Assessments - to provide students with effective and accurate feedback, teachers will assess frequently where students are in relation to a course's learning goals or final product (summative assessment). \u00b7 Metacognitive Strategies - s tudents will be given opportunities to plan, organize, manage their own work, create goals, direct their own learning, and to self- reflect along the way. Providing students with time and a safe space to be aware of their learning progress and their mental state, will allow them to take ownership of their success and challenges. TVHS will also create an environment for active learning. Active learning means engaged learners. TVHS's curriculum will require students to interact with each other, apply curriculum to real -life situations, and use a variety of technological tools beyond the classroom. Students are also exposed to opportunities for project -based learning. In 48 Calvin, S. (2020).

(2015). 5 Highly Effective https://www.edutopia.org/blog/5 -highly - effective -teaching -practices -rebecca- alber Academic Plan 53 accommodating i ndividual learning styles and individual learner needs TVHS's curriculum incorporates the following instructional practices: \u00b7 Summit Learning - TVHS will incorporate the Summit Learning Curriculum for core curriculum classes. These classes include English, Math, Science, Social Studies. Summit Learning is a research -based approach to education designed to drive student engagement, meaningful learning, and strong student- teacher relationships that prepare students for life beyond the classroom. The Summit Learning program offers schools customizable curriculum, a range of educational resources and technology tools, professional development for educato rs, ongoing coaching, and support for schools. Students learn from teachers through whole groups, small groups, and one- on-one time. Project -based and group learning allow teachers the opportunity to demonstrate for students the application of life -long le arning skills via team collaboration, data interpretation, and persuasive arguments. The curriculum largely centers on real world related projects. Students connect what they are learning to life beyond the classroom.50 \u00b7 SEED Impact - The TVHS elective choice for our secondary programming is the SEED Impact Program. SEED Impact is a program that focuses on internal growth utilizing Social Emotional Learning (SEL). SEL intentionally develops attitudes, behaviors, and skills that are fundamental for academic and life success. SEL programming incorporates two essential benefits mentioned above \u00b7 Kagan training - Kagan structures are a way of grouping students and allows for students to interact and work together. \u00b7 Audio, Visual, and Kinesthetic less ons in all classrooms. \u00b7 Universal Design of Learning - The Universal Design of Learning provides a framework that includes flexible methods for presentation, expression and active learning, and student engagement, so all students (i.e., students with disabilities, English language learners) can participate in core instruction. 51 \u00b7 Systematic and Explicit Instruction - TVHS teachers will use both formative and summative assessment data to align with instruction. Explicit components include connecting the new content to previous learning, provides feedback, and provides opportunities to practice . Systematic components will include building lessons upon one another by moving from simple skills to more complex skills, prioritizes tasks from easy to challenging, and scaffolds instruction by providing support.52 \u00b7 Project & Problem -Based Instruction - Instruction that centers on hands -on, real-world activities, projects, and problems that help students to understand the knowledge and skills they develop in the classroom may be applied in everyday life. This approach scaffolds student learning through structured activities and projects that empower students to 50 Summit Learning. (n.d.).

T hese Professional Learning Communities (PLCs) will provide opportunities within the school to engage multiple teaming patterns. \u00b7 Technology - TVHS recognizes that instructional technology can facilitate learning and enhance the curriculum itself. All membe rs of TVHS , including parents, will benefit from the success of the technology plan. The teachers will improve their lesson plans and delivery methods. The students will have the opportunity to be exposed to and to learn an enhanced curriculum with all the additional tools for computation and visualization. (3) Explain how the proposed instructional model and curriculum will be used to meet the needs of and enable measurable growth for all students according to the Nevada Academic Content Standards , including those that are in need of remediation and those that are intellectually gifted. The proposed instructional model and curriculum of TVHS is through Summit Learning. These classes include English, Math, Science, Social Studies. Summit Learning is a research -based approach to education designed to drive student engagement, meaningful learning, and strong student -teacher relationships that prepare students for life beyond the classroom. The Summit Learning program offers schools customizable curriculum, a range of educational resources and technology tools, professional development for educators, ongoing coaching, and support for schools. Students learn from teachers through whole groups, sm all groups, and one -on-one time. Project -based and group learning allow teachers the opportunity to demonstrate for students the application of life -long learning skills via team collaboration, data interpretation, and persuasive arguments. The curriculum largely centers on real world related projects. Students connect what they are learning to life beyond the classroom. Through the partnership with CSN, TVHS will offer a dual credit program or Jump Start program offered to students. Those who are credit de ficient will have the opportunity to make up those required credits through programs provided by the school. TVHS will work to ensure that its graduates meet state graduation requirements. (4) Explain how the school will identify and differentiate to meet the needs of intellectually gifted students in a way that extends their learning and offers them unique, tailored opportunities. Include information on how staffing will be structured to ensure that gifted students are adequately supported. Please note that Nevada law classifies intellectually gifted students as eligible for specific support services. How will staffing be structured to ensure that gifted students are adequately supported? The high school program will offer two options for gifted students: Gifted Program through the content areas (9 -12) /High School Gifted Courses: TVHS will offer gifted content area courses and/or State -approved high school elective courses. All students in 53 Pieratt, J. (2019). What is the difference between problem based and project based learning? Retri eved - learning/ Academic Plan 55 the gifted course will be eligible for gifted services. Teachers of gifted students will be certified in the appropriate content field endorsed to teach gifted or on an approved waiver to complete the gifted endorsement and finish within three years. Consultation Model: Some gifted students who may not take gifted courses (due to scheduling conflicts or other issues) may use the consultation model. Teachers of the gifted will meet regularly with the gifted consultation model student to discuss their progress and set realistic goals. The teacher of the gifted may also contact the administration, counselors, general education teacher(s), social worker, parent, and/or the respective students, if he/she deems appropriate, to discuss and/or monitor instructional alternatives designed to ensure that the gifted students achieve successful accomplishment of gifted goals in their courses. (5) Describe the professional development teachers will receive to ensure high levels of implementation of the instructional model and curriculum . Teachers will receive professiona l development that align with the mission and vision of TVHS. The Summit Learning program offers schools customizable curriculum, a range of educational resources and technology tools. This includes professional development for educators, ongoing coaching, and support for schools. To support the social -emotional learning component, SEED Impact will guide the professional development of teachers and the leadership team to clarify core practices that will maximize outcomes. In addition, teachers will meet weekly with Professional Learning Communities (PLCs) that are grouped by grade levels/content areas and administration. 54 (6) If the proposed charter school intends to include a vocational or career and technical education program, provide a description of the career and technical education program that will be implemented by the charter school. TVHS will offer a technology component, GRADD.co, NVBAA, and Cyberjutsu. GRADD.co provides the software expertise and training to create highly accurate 3D models through drone flying, virtual reality and augmented reality. It is the world's fastest photogrammetry software. The Nevada Business Aviation Association (NVBAA) promotes aviation by developing and offering STEM education curriculum and by prov iding workforce training programs. Participants in the FAA Part 107 Remote Pilot Training will receive industry leading instruction to prepare for the exam. We have partnered with the Women's Society of Cyberjutsu (WSC), to create a unique and rigorous Cybersecurity curriculum. WSC serves thousands of women, men, and girls across the globe by bringing awareness to, and advancing careers in, cybersecurity. The WSC community includes information security professionals, IT professionals, programmers, computer scientists and engineers, as well as women wanting to explore and join the field. Recognizing the importance of encouraging girls to embrace a future in STEM -related professions through its Cyberjutsu Girls Academy, WSC provides a unique hands -on curriculum focused on securing information technology. WSC's mission is to advance women in cybersecurity careers by providing programs and partnerships that promote hands -on training, networking, education, mentoring, resource - sharing and other professional oppor tunities. We envision a cyber -community where all students can reach their full potential & thrive with unlimited opportunity. GRADD.CO/NVBAA/Cyberjutsu student outcome findings will include obtaining a certification in the selected pathway area , continuin g to CSN through the dual enrollment option , and g aining employment after graduation. 54 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Retrieved from https://www.cdc.gov/healthyschools/tths/pd_follow_up.htm Academic Plan 56 PROGRAMS OF DISTANCE EDUCATION (Distance Education Applicants Only) A charter school that wishes to provide distance education (online, virtual, cyber, etc.) courses and/or programs (NRS 388.820 -388.874 and NAC 388.800 -388.860) must submit a distance education application to the Nevada Department of Education prior to or in conjunction with its application to the SPCSA. For applicants who do not propose to offer a program of distance education, please provide a brief statement explaining that the questions in this section are not applicable. TVHS will not offer a full -time online distance learning option. However, TVHS will offer a hybrid option where students will attend in -person for three days (including Wellness Wednesday) and two asynchronous days. This will be on an AA/C/BB schedule. Requested changes to schedules will be completed at the beginning of the new semester. PROMOTION AND HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS Please note that h igh schools approved by the SPCSA will be required to meet or exceed Nevada graduation requirements. (1) Explain how students will matriculate through the school (i.e., promotion/retention policies) and how stakeholders will be informed of these standards. TVHS's students will be promoted, or graduate based on academic achievement criteria based on mastery of the grade level subject matter. The academic team will review passing grades in Mathematics , English, Social Studies and Science (core classes), elective courses, as well as how the student demonstrates appropriate social and emotional maturity (growth mindset). In determining promotion or retention decisions, TVHS shall consider the recommendation of the student's teachers, academic advisor, adult mentor, the student's grade in each course, the student's score on required state assessments and any other pertinent academic information needed to make an appropriate educational decision that represents the student's mastery of the content. Assessments: Accountability for student achievement will be the primary mission at TVHS. Assessments will assist the school in determining student mastery of Nevada Academic Content Standards and ass ist in determining whether students are equipped with the necessary knowledge and skills they need to be college and career ready. Therefore, every child enrolled at TVHS will participate in academic assessments. TVHS does not recognize parent opt out or parent/student refusal to test. If a parent keeps their child home during mandatory testing, TVHS will utilize the progressive attendance policy and the test will be made up upon the student's return to school. Retention Policy: TVHS will implement a str ict policy regarding retention. Students must meet specific levels of performance to be promoted. For students who are not meeting grade level performance standards and are at risk for retention, the parent/guardian will be notified to provide opportunitie s for intervention and remediation. At the end of the year, the student's data will be reviewed, in conjunction with the parent/guardian, and a final determination of grade level promotion or retention will be made by administration. If a student reaches twenty (20) absences in a school year, that student may be retained dependent on academic growth. The final determination will be made by administration.

Received supplemental support services such as special education services that do not recommend retention (IEP and/or Section 504) 2. The Retention/Promotion Committee (teachers, academic advisor, and administrators) will determine if the student has shown a dequate progress and mastery of the NVACS student who does not meet these will be considered for retention by the committee. The student's parent/guardian will be integrally involved in the process and any education decision made. Students must maintain a minimum 60% mastery in NVACS for their grade level to be eligible for promotion. Upon failure to perform satisfactorily on the statewide assessment, a student shall be referred to the Retention /Promotion Committee consisting of the student's teacher (s), parents, and a school administrator. The team will determine if the student receives remedial instruction or be retained. All stakeholders will be informed of these standards through TVHS's website and through the student and parent -guardian handbook, which all students and guardians will sign at the beginning of each school year. (3) For schools proposing a high school program, e xplain how the graduation requirements will ensure student readiness for college or other postsecondary opportunities (e .g., trade school, military service, or entering the workforce). TVHS plans to exceed the state requirements for earning a diploma, students will have the possibility to earn 32 credits, with the possibility of earning college credits as well. Students will be required to pass four years of math, English, science, and s ocial studies. Through TVHS unique pathways of SEL, Drone flight/Tech, Cybersecurity, students will also be able to earn college credits through CSN, and/or obtain their certification to be employed immediately following graduation.

For high schools, describe your plans to support students needing to access credit recovery options. TVHS will h ave in place a tier intervention model (RTI) which will provide the necessary structures and support for students who are at risk of dropping out of school and/or not meeting Nevada's requirements for graduation. This tier intervention model will provide several opportunities for intervention that will support both the student's social -emotional and academic needs.56 Students of TVHS will be allowed to earn up to eight credits in one school year. Those who are deficient in credits may earn more credits by taking an additional term of courses to be considered on -track for graduation. TVHS's guidance counselors will be available and provide support to make the necessary adjustments to ensure student success and to graduate. The RTI intervention support will allow students to receive additional academic support during the school year and/or during scheduled intersessions including summer break. This will provide opportunities for students to earn additional credits. TVHS will also incorporate a one -to-one men toring program allowing for students to build positive relationships with their peers, teachers, and community. Students will meet with their mentors through sessions on Wellness Wednesdays where together, they will set long and short- term goals. These ses sions will foster strong relationships between students and mentors as they celebrate successes and discuss learning opportunities from roadblocks they need to overcome. DUAL -CREDIT PARTNERSHIPS High schools approved by the SPCSA will be expected to enter into cooperative agreements with one or more community colleges, state colleges and universities to offer dual credit courses per NRS 389.310. For applicants who do not propose to operate a high school program during the initial charter term, please pr ovide a brief statement explaining that the questions in this section are not applicable. 1. Discuss the scope of the services and resources that will be provided by the college or university.

Internal assessments will be used to monitor student progress throughout the course and will include MAP growth te sting, class unit tests, and End of Course (EOC) exams. These results may also shift students' instructional level and their need for intervention and/or assistance. External assessments will be used to provide end of year feedback to plan student learning and professional development for the following school year and will include the PSAT, ACT, NV CRT Science, and the SEED Impact social emotional assessments.

In addition to mandatory state testing, identify the primary interim academic assessments the school will use to assess student -learning needs and ensure progress towards SPCSA and state proficiency targets and describe how they will be used. (a) How will you support teachers in developing embedded assessments and checks for understanding in order to ensure that instruction meets student needs? To support teachers in developing embedded assessments, teachers will meet weekly by subject area, and be given exam ples of embedded assessments and data. Teachers will then be given time to plan out each week . Teachers will plan relevant activities, projects, group activities, to provide assessment data about a particular learning standard. The purpose of the data is to use it to make Academic Plan 67 instructional decisions on a group or an individual basis. Teachers will monitor the data and will refer students whose needs cannot be met through the RTI process. (b) Explain how you will know that your proposed interim assessments are valid and reliable indicators of progress. Explain how these interim assessments align with the school's curriculum, performance goals for the school and the SPCSA, and state standards. TVHS administration will utilize the MAP Growth asse ssments as our indicator of progress. MAP assessments will be given three times each school year in the fall, winter, and spring. These assessments are nationally benchmarked and are valid and reliable indicators of progress. 57 These assessments align with TVHS's curriculum and performance goals and are aligned to the NVACS . Teachers will also be regularly monitoring each student's progress through unit pre - and post -tests . (c) Describe the corrective actions the school will take if it falls short of student academic achievement expectations or goals at the school -wide and classroom level. Explain what would trigger such corrective actions and who would be responsible for implementing them. At the school -wide level, the administration and instructional team will review the school wide data to determine the areas of need and use the data to drive the school improvement plan. Staff will work together in PLCs to create an action plan identifying both successful and unsucc essful strategies. At the classroom level, the administration, through observations, walk -throughs, and classroom data, will identify which t eachers will need extra support. Professional development and mentoring support will be provided. A corrective plan would be developed, and the teacher would be expected to implement the corrective action(s) with support. (d) Articulate how interim assessments will be used to inform instruction. How will teachers and school leaders be trained in their use? TVHS will u se interim assessment results to inform instruction. All reports on interim assessments and stated -mandated assessments will be made available to teachers, students, and TVHS to disaggregate the data. This data will communicate findings, areas of strength, and areas of improvement for each student. Teachers will use this data to inform instruction, enhance curriculum and teacher effectiveness, and encourage student growth toward proficiency. TVHS will utilize time during Wellness Wednesdays or one time each quarter in which faculty and staff will compile progress monitoring results and subject area teams will disaggregate the data and plan instruction and future assessments. TVHS will also structure non -instructional time during the day for vertical and hori zontal team articulation and PLCs. 57 Northwest Evaluation Association.

By taking the ACT, students can make themselves visible to colleges and scholarship agencies. 11th grade 5. How will the school monitor for disparities in academic performance between student groups? What actions with the school take to address identified disparities? Achievement gaps are defined as \"the differences in academic performance between groups of students of different backgrounds.\"59 These groups include racial and ethnic minorities, English second language learners, students from low -income families, and students with disabilities.4 These academic disparities include:2 Access to academi c opportunities ( i.e., advanced courses, AP courses, dual credit courses); Student performance on assessments (i.e., SAT, ACT, statewide tests, etc.); and Student attainment (i.e., high school diploma, graduation, college acceptance, employment). The Nati onal Education Association (NEA) recommends strategies for monitoring disparities in student achievement.60 Table 3.11 presents effective strategies NEA recommends and focuses on identifying contributing factors early in the school year.61 59 National Education Association.

Source: Hanover Research62 TVHS will monitor for disparities in academic performance between student groups by dividing the process into three phases. The first phase is gathering and analyzing data that will help to gain a better understanding of student performance. The second phase includes addressing the question \"What are the root causes of our disparities\" in student performance? Understanding and conducting a root cause analysis will help TVHS learn more about how and why disparities exist. The third phase is creating an action plan that addresses the question \"How will root causes of dispar ities\" in student performance be addressed? This stage will help TVHS create an action plan that can be implemented, monitored, and improved over time. 63 At-Risk Students 1. How do you define \"at -risk\" students? What are the methods for identifying at -risk students through academic and behavioral processes? At-risk s tudents are students with a higher probability of failing academically or dropping out of school , and who face circumstances that could jeopardize their ability to complete school, such as homelessness, incarceration, teenage pregnancy, serious health issues, domestic violence, 62 Hanover Research.

Academic Plan 73 transiency, or other conditions. It may also refer to learning disabilities, low test scores, disciplinary problems, grade retention, or other learning -related factors that could adversely affect educational performance. Other key factors are attendance, low literacy , lack of interest in school, negative interactions with peers, behavioral issues including aggression, violence, social withdrawal, family history/backg round, and educational history.64 Given the population the TVHS intends to serve, there is a significant percentage of the students to be identified as 'at- risk' based on the definition of \"at -risk\" as in NRS 388A.045 : \"A pupil is 'at risk' if t he pupil has an economic or academic disadvantage such that he or she requires special services and assistance to enable him or her to succeed in educational programs. The term includes, without limitation, pupils who are members of economically disadvanta ged families, pupils who are English learners, pupils who are at risk of dropping out of high school and pupils who do not meet minimum standards of academic proficiency. The term does not include a pupil with a disability.\" 65 Generally, at -risk students a re those with a higher probability of failure due to academic or behavioral challenges. Academically, initial indicators are grades a nd scores on diagnostic assessments. Behaviorally, TVHS will monitor the success of behavior interventions to indicate which students need more significant behavioral support. Multiple sources and early warning systems will be used to identify at -risk students. TVHS recognizes that many factors can be associated with increased risk of academic failure and/or potential dropo ut of students, such as:66 \u00b7 Social and economic risk factors, including: o Free and reduced lunch; o Single parent family; o Student pregnancy or parenthood; o Parent educational attainment; o Foster care; o Homelessness; and o Involved in the juvenile justice system. \u00b7 Diagnostic testing (students who do not meet current grade level mastery expectations). \u00b7 Review of attendance records - if a student has a documented history of more than 10% absenteeism. \u00b7 Review of discipline records - if a student has documented hi story of 3 or more offenses in a school year. \u00b7 Documented input regarding academic performance provided by previous administration, teacher, and school staff. Students who are identified as academically 'at risk' and who are not already identified with an Individualized Education Plan (IEP) will be referred to TVHS's RTI team. The RTI team will be 64 National Ed ucation Association. (n.d.). Understanding the Gaps: Who are we leaving behind and how far?

The teacher of record will notify the parent(s) that his/her child will be entering the RTI program, which will provide interventions in all areas of the student's academic or behavioral deficiencies. During the RTI process, a goal is written in the deficit academic and/or behavioral area, the student is provided with additional interventions, and the student has weekly progress monitoring related to the goal. The data is collected and analyzed every 4 -6 weeks. If the student is not making adequate progress toward the grade level expectation, then instruction becomes more intensive by increasing the amount of time in intervention, increasing the number of sessions in intervention, or changing the teaching method. If after 12 -16 weeks, the student's data still shows a lack of adequate progress, the student will be referred for the special education eligibility process. Should the student qualify for special education, the student will receive support in regular education with supplementary aids and service s. Progress monitoring will continue. If a student shows little to no academic growth, an IEP meeting will be held to discuss increasing services which may include a more restrictive environment and additional supplementary aids and supports. The goal is t o provide the student access to a free and appropriate public education within the least restrictive environment using student's data in the decision -making process. 2. Describe how you will identify the needs of all students. Identify the research -based programs, strategies and supports you will utilize to provide a broad continuum of services, ensure students' access to the general education curriculum in the least res trictive environment. All students will be engaged in and benefit from the curriculum including exceptional students or students who enter TVHS below grade level. The results of the student's prior year standardized tests results and other student records, will be used to determine the best educational setting for students (e.g., appropriate course selection, tutoring, referral for special servic es). Students who are identified as academically at -risk, who are not already identified with an IEP, will be referred to the RTI team. Progress monitoring will ensure that students are receiving the appropriate continuum of services and equitable access to the general education curriculum. During daily collaborative team meetings, staff will review student performance data from all instructional tiers to determine next day steps of instruction. Progress monitoring by special education staff will be done on a weekly basis to determine the effectiveness of the instructional program. Adjustments to instructional program s will be made as student progress or lack of progress is determined. Revisions to IEPs will occur as adjustments are needed to a student's academic program towards a restrictive environment based on progress. Apart from providing the specific services listed in a student's IEP, Section 504, and/or ELL plans for EL Ls, as applicable, THVS' s faculty will differentiate instruction as necessary, a s well as offer tutoring services or other such assistance to ensure students remain successful. Student performance will be continuously assessed. Students not making adequate progress towards the NVACS will be identified and the following measures will be instituted: \u00b7 All students not meeting standards will be placed on a Progress Monitoring Plan (PMP) and specific strategies to remediate any learning deficiencies will be implemented (excluding ELLs who have been participating in the English to Speakers of Other Languages ( ESOL ) program for less than 2 years.) Academic Plan 75 \u00b7 Reading strategies in the content areas will be facilitated throughout the curriculum to provide students additional practice in addition to those taught during language arts classes. \u00b7 Saturdays and daily pullout tutoring may be required for those students consistently demonstrating non -mastery of the standards. \u00b7 Students consistently demonstrating non -mastery of b enchmarks on teacher generated quizzes, chapter tests, projects, investigations, and poor academic progress will be targeted for supplemental and intensive instruction/intervention. In addition, students needing remediation based on respective subject area assessments in specific subject areas will be assigned to and placed on a spec ific PMP targeting these deficiencies. This plan requires active participation from the student, the parents, and specific teachers to ensure continuous student improvement. This initiative allows each student to have ownership and understa nding of his or her learning style and allows each student to track and monitor his or her achievement. The PMP will consist of specific measurable individualized goals for that student, as well the strategies and services (tutoring , required additional classes, E nglish Language Development (ELD) services) to be implemented for the student to achieve the specified goals. Special education must be provided in the L east Restrictive Environment (LRE). To the maximum extent appropriate, children with disabilities must be educated with their nondisabled peers. Students with disabilities may be removed from the regular educational environment only when the nature or severity of the disability is such that modifications, supplementary aids, and services are insufficient in the general education environment. Specialized education (including related services) can be offered in: \u00b7 the general education classroom; \u00b7 a resource room; \u00b7 a self -contained classroom; \u00b7 at home; \u00b7 in hospitals; or \u00b7 in residential programs. It is possible that a child's needs cannot be adequately met in the mainstream classroom even with accommodations and services. In that event, the IEP team may decide that so me combination of a specialized learning environment and the general classroom, or a more segregated setting, is necessary to permit that child to benefit from his or her education. When a student is removed from the general education classroom, the commi ttee must explain in detail why the removal is necessary. Even then, the student must be allowed to participate with nondisabled students at mealtime, recess, or any other non- academic or extracurricular activity, unless compelling needs or performance of that student require otherwise . 3. Describe the school's approach to help remediate students' academic underperformance. Detail the identification strategy, interventions, and remediation to be implemented. Cite the research/rationale for the chosen metho ds. How will you measure the success of your academic remediation efforts (in year 1, year 3, year 5, and beyond?) TVHS is committed to serving the needs of all its students, regardless of level, learning style, and/or special needs. In support of our miss ion, the goal remains that all students attain and demonstrate mastery of the NV ACS . Academic underperformance is first identified during the enrollment process when reviewing student's records and transcripts. The Special Education and Section 504 Academic Plan 76 team may also choose to immediately refer students with significant concerns to the school -wide Student Study Team (SST) to ensure that more intensive actions are taken to address the student's needs. Students that test below benchmark and/or receive a failing g rade in one or more of their classes will be transitioned to the appropriate tier level of instruction to receive more face -to-face interventions. If a student is already on campus full time and displays low grades and or shows needs based on their intervention screening, the student will be assigned to a case manager for direct follow up. The case manager will work directly with TVHS's Academic Advisor and the student's parent/guardian to provide one -on-one interventions. Students that do not qualify for an IEP or a Section 504 plan will still work with their teachers one on one each day through small group interventions and after and before each schedule transition. Teachers will schedule interventions with students and parents/guardians to assist in mastering their learning objectives. TVHS's daily collaborative team sessions will identify students and thei r areas of struggle. Each teacher, based on their expertise, will be assigned a group of students to monitor and schedule one on one or small group intervention. If increased performance is not seen on course assignments, assessment scores, and progress scores , classroom teachers may refer the student to the SST . The team will prioritize further interventions. All academic interventions will be measured by examining year -by-year assessment data. If improvement is not seen amongst students within the bottom 20%, then school- wide intervention practices will be revised. In accordance with student's needs, TVHS may employ Reading and/or Math instructional coaches and will employ the adequate number of ELL and Exceptional Student Education ( ESE) personnel requi red, as well as the counseling staff necessary to adequately support and properly service students. Classroom teachers will use research -based texts, enhanced by supplementary materials and programs, to ensure student success. Teachers will be required to document in lesson plans when and how each standard is taught and assessed. TVHS will offer free tutoring after school and on Wellness Wednesdays to fill and address learning gaps, as well as enrichment programs aligned to ELA/Math and Science standards, s uch as Robotics Club and Art Club . These activities will be offered to address all learner needs as well as foster an academic culture and love of learning both in and out of the classroom, further promoting TVHS's mission. Data- Driven Individualized Supp orts for A ll Students TVHS will have a Response to Intervention (RTI) team within a Multi -Tier System of Supports (MTSS) structure composed of administrators, teachers, and specialists trained to use the framework to effectively meet the academic and behavioral needs of all students. T VHS will implement strategies designed to address individualized learning needs, including educationally disa dvantaged students and students with special needs who may be at -risk of falling behind. TVHS's RTI team will oversee and monitor the early warning system including: 67 \u00b7 Collecting and analyzing data on the number of students identified by the system as exhibiting two or more early warning indicators, the number of students by grade level who exhibit each early warning indicator. 67 United States Department of Education.

Academic Plan 77 \u00b7 Preparing a description of all intervention strategies employed to improve the academic performance of students identified by the early warning system. \u00b7 Determining, in consultation with the parent, appropriate intervention strategies based on data from the early warning system for each student who exhibits two or more early warning indicators, unless the student is already being serv ed by an intervention. Implementation of RTI/MTSS : Multiple tiers of increasingly intense instruction and intervention services are implemented to support student success as part of the RTI/MTSS process. Students not meeting specific levels of performance in content areas for each grade level (or not meeting specific levels of performance on statewide assessments) will receive additional diagnostic assessments to determine the nature of the student's difficulty and areas of academic need. Students needing remediation or intensive instructional/behavioral support will be matched to strategic and intensive instruction/ interventions. 68 \u00b7 Tier 1 is inclusive of all students. All students in Tier 1 will receive high quality, research - based instruction, differentiated to meet their needs and will be screened at minimum on bi-weekly basis to identify struggling learners who need additional support. Core academic interventions include the use of the core curriculum and whole -class instruction and interventions. Core behavioral interventions include school -wide discipline policies and procedures, as well as positive behavior supports. Academic assessments at the Tier 1 include mid -year assessments, benchmark assessments, formative and summative assessments, and end- of-year assessments. Behavioral assessments at the Tier 1 include observational data, parent conference records and disciplinary data. \u00b7 Tier 2 is inclusive of students not making progress in the core curriculum. TVHS will provide these students with increasingly intensive instruction matched to their needs including, but not limited to small group instruction, one -to-one re -teaching, pull- out intervention, individualized instruction, intensive interventions that address each student's needs, and additional tutoring opportunities with a qualified interventionist. \u00b7 Tier 3 interventions are introduced when students need a more frequent, inte nse, and individualized instructional setting, which may include but would not be limited to: d aily pull -out tutoring, one -on-one instructions; behavior intervention plan, individualized counseling, and intensive individualized academic plans following assessments . After school and summer tutoring will be available to TVHS's students regardless of being identified as being \"deficient\" in their academic performance in core classes. Key findings from the National Center for Education Evaluation and Regional Assistance showed \"one year of enhanced instruction produces positive and statistically significant impacts on student achievement.\" 69 Services for Students with S pecial Needs TVHS's model allows educationally disadvantaged students, including students with d isabilities and students entering below grade level, to benefit highly from the core curriculum.

To accomplish this, TVHS will commit to instruction that incorporates supports and accommodates students including: 1. An Individualized Education Pla n (IEP) for Special Education students and a progress monitoring plan for students below grade level proficiency, which include annual goals aligned with and chosen to facilitate their attainment of grade -level academic standards. 2. Teachers and specialized instructional support personnel who are prepared and qualified to deliver high quality, evidence- based, individualized instruction, and support services. 3. Instructional accommodations in materials or procedures - which do not change the standards but allow students to learn within the framework of the NVACS . 4. Assistive technology devices and services to ensure that students with special needs have equal learning and developmental opportunities; and 5. Instructional supports for learning based on the principles of Universal Design for Learning (UDL) 70, which foster student engagement by presenting information in multiple ways and allowing for diverse avenues of action and expression. In addition to providing the specific services listed in a student's IEP and/or ELL plan, TVHS will offer tutoring services or other such assistance to ensure students remain successful. Evaluating Meeting the Needs Components of monitoring and evaluating meeting the needs of subgroups include: \u00b7 Teacher utilized flexible grouping. \u00b7 Types of flexible grouping were utilized ( i.e., pairs, small groups, and/or independent practice)? \u00b7 Teacher differentiated instruction for all levels of learners. \u00b7 Teacher scaffold instruction for special education students and/or ELL students \u00b7 Example of how the teacher differentiated instruction for learners. \u00b7 Assignments and assessments were meaningful, rigorous, and at or above grade level. \u00b7 Teacher grade book reflected meaningful, rigorous, and at grade level assignments/assessments. \u00b7 Teacher provided an explicit closure to ensure mastery of lesson objectives. \u00b7 Teacher conduct ed a review and emphasized the important points of the lesson \u00b7 Teacher utilized technology in the lesson. \u00b7 Teacher maintained appropriate pacing throughout the lesson to engage students. 4. Describe your Response to Intervention model in detail, including the interventions and the anticipated proportion of the student body served at each tier level. Please provide the rationale used in this approximation. TVHS is committed to servi ng the needs of all its students, regardless of their baseline data, learning style, and/or special needs. In support of our mission, the goal remains that all students attain and demonstrate mastery of the NVACS . TVHS will utilize a RTI team within the MTSS structure 70 CAST (2018). Universal Design for Learning Guidelines version 2.2.

The RTI implementa tion at TVHS will contribute to more meaningful identification of learning and behavioral problems, improve instructional quality, provide all students with the best opportunities to succeed, and assist with the identification of learning difficulties and problems. Parents will be invited to RTI meetings to review screening data and place the student in a group intervention, when a student is placed in a second group of intervention, when an individual intervention is designed for the student, and when a special education referral is initiated. Parents will be continually informed about the plan and its implementation. The RTI model at TVHS will have four essential components: (1) a school -wide, multi -level instructional and behavioral system for preventing school failure, ( 2) screening, (3) progress monitoring, and ( 4) data- based decision making for instruction and movement within the multi - level system. 73 The RTI model is a multi -tiered approach to providing high quality instruction and intervention matche d to student needs, using learning rate over time and level of performance to inform instructional decisions. Embodied in each tier are four steps TVHS will implement: 1. Identify the problem. 2. Analyze the problem and determine why there is a discrepancy. 3. Esta blish a performance goal for the student, develop an intervention plan to address the goal, and monitor the student's progress during implementation. 4. Use evidence -based data, collected during progress monitoring, to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention. Once effectiveness has been evaluated, the RTI team will determine if additional intervention is needed and/or adjust the intervention to support student progress. Within the RTI structure, resources will be aligned to a three -tier model that will use increasingly more intense instruction. Tiers include increasing levels of intensity of interventions.7475 Tier 1 will include evidence -based instruction in the general education classroom with core instructional interventions. Tier 1 will include differentiated curriculum and instruction for all students. Primary instruction will include at -risk children who have be en identified through the universal screening process to receive evidence -based instruction, sometimes in small groups, sometimes as part of a class -wide intervention. A certain amount of time (generally not more than 71 Wayne RESA. (n.d.). Quick Guide for Multi -Tiered System of Supports: The Building Level.

Retrieved from http://www.rtinetwork.org/learn Academic Plan 80 six or eight weeks) will be allotted t o determine if the student responds to the intervention \u2014hence, the name RTI . Each student's progress will be monitored closely. If the student does, indeed, respond to the evidence -based intervention, then this indicates that perhaps his or her difficulties have resulted from less appropriate or insufficiently targeted instruction. The Tier 1 process will include the following components: \u00b7 Expectations - 80% or more of students successful with general education curriculum and instruction. \u00b7 Assessments - universal screenings for academics and social/emotional growth (behaviors). \u00b7 Interventions - through differentiated instructional practices. \u00b7 Roles and responsibilities - primarily the general education teacher. Tier 2 will include small group intervention with intensive assistance for students who are performing below monitored progress expectations at Tier 1. Tier 2 includes targeted interventions for students at -risk. Tier 2 standard treatment protocol interventions will include interventions that are: \u00b7 Eviden ced-based interventions; \u00b7 From education research; \u00b7 Experiential- based Interventions; and \u00b7 From best practice with like students. The length of time in Tier 2 is instructional time in addition to Tier 1, and the level of intensity of the interventions is gre ater. They may also be more closely targeted to the areas in which the child is having difficulty. Again, the child's progress is closely monitored. The time allotted to see if the child responds to interventions in this more intensive level may be longer than in the first level - a marking period, for instance, rather than seven weeks - but the overall process is much the same. The Tier 2 process will include the following components: \u00b7 Expectation - 15% of students may be at risk and in need of targeted interventions; \u00b7 Assessment - progress monitoring of student response to specific intervention; \u00b7 Intervention - standard protocol treatment intervention as available from the research; evidence -based intervention as available in the literature; and \u00b7 Roles and responsibilities - variety of personnel as determined at the local site. Tier 3 become s an option for conti nued and more intensive intervention. Five percent of students may be at significant risk and in need of intense interventions. If, however, the child does not respond to the first level of group -oriented interventions, he or she typically moves to the nex t RTI level. Tier 3 involves the use of a combination of different types of curriculum material(s) including but not limited to: standard protocol treatment intervention as available from the research, evidence -based intervention as available in the literature, and unique intervention based on teacher expertise. Tier 3 is more individualized as well as more intensive. Weekly progress monitoring specific to the intervention should continue; analysis of every four data points will take place to determine whet her the student is showing progress. If progress monitoring graph line is flat lining (student showing no progress) then intensity of instruction will be increased. Intensity can be increased by providing intensive intervention to the student in a smaller group or individually by increasing the minutes per session, increasing the number of sessions per day or week, and/or by changing the method of instruction. If the child does not respond to instruction at this level, then he or she will need to be referred for a full and individual evaluation under IDEA. Academic Plan 81 Regardless of the number of interventions TVHS implements, each will be classified under one of the three levels of prevention. This will allow for a common understanding across the entire process. At Tier 1, evidence- based core instructional and behavioral methodologies, practices and supports designed for all students will provide the foundation in general education. Tier 2 will consist of supplemental instruction and interventions that are provided in addition to and in alignment with core instruction and behavioral supports to targeted groups of students identified as needing additional assistance. Tier 3 is targeted for those students that require intensive instructional or behavioral intervention in ad dition to and in alignment with core instruction. At this tier, instruction and intervention intensity is reflected in increased frequency, greater duration and/or more individualization. Tier 1 is inclusive of all students. All students in Tier 1 will re ceive high quality, evidence- based instruction, differentiated to meet their needs and will be screened at minimum on bi-weekly basis to identify struggling learners who need additional support. Core academic interventions include the use of the core curri culum and whole -class instruction and interventions, following research - based instructional strategies and best practices. Core behavioral interventions would include school -wide discipline policies and procedures, as well as positive behavior supports. Be havioral assessments at Tier 1 include observational data, parent conference records and disciplinary data. The RTI process will consist of the following: \u00b7 RTI teams review (Tier 1 meetings) the screening data and identify students in need of additional su pport through Tier 2 intervention. For those students that meet benchmark standards, they will continue to remain at Tier 1 and their progress will be monitored at the next benchmark assessment. \u00b7 While receiving intervention at Tier 2, a student's progress will be monitored by the RTI team to determine if progress is being made adequately. If a student is not progressing and the intervention(s) has been implemented as designed, the student will be referred to the School Support Team (SST). The SST will con sist of the School administrator, school psychologist, counselor, general education teacher and the parent(s), EL L Coordinator (as applicable). The SST will assist teachers in providing additional interventions for students with learning, emotional, social , and behavioral problems in school, primarily within general education classes. The SST process will be initiated as assistance is requested and the collection of student information such as history of grades, background screening, attendance, academic, b ehavioral and/or social -emotional screening assessments etc. is conducted. Continual filtering of a student 's response to intervention determines the effectiveness of interventions and assists in the data -based decisions. After the consideration of all the data by the SST, a data- driven decision is made as to whether a referral for a Multi -disciplinary Team evaluation will be initiated. This rigorous and constant sorting and analyzing of information makes the SST a reliable and efficient system incorporatin g the tiers of intervention delivery. In addition to the SST being a valuable resource for schools it is also a filtering process which serves to fluidly move students through the tiers of intervention, always evaluating and monitoring their response to these interventions and making data -based decisions every step of the way. It is a process that ensures the delivery of general education interventions first to address student's academic, behavioral and/or social emotional needs. The filtering then begins as students who continue to perform below standards and show inadequate response to general education interventions, even when provided with appropriate instruction and evidence -based interventions, formally enter the SST process. Academic Plan 82 The SST will review the s creening and progress monitoring data and information provided from all other relevant records to develop more focused, intensive interventions for the student. Parent(s)/guardian(s) are integral team members and will be invited to provide data regarding developmental history and current functioning within the family and community units. Barriers to learning will be identified and strategies to overcome such barriers will be developed. Progress monitoring schedule will be determined, and responsible person s will determine the implementation of interventions and progress monitoring. Interventions will be implemented and monitored. Progress monitoring data will be collected a minimum of every two weeks and parents will be notified of intervention implementat ion and student progress over time. The school psychologist will periodically conduct fidelity checks on the SST Intervention Plan while assisting with progress monitoring data collection. If the focused, evidence -based interventions attempted at all Tiers do not produce a satisfactory level of progress, as evidenced by review of the RTI data and an analysis of any existing barriers to learning, interventions will be modified, and a comprehensive evaluation may be requested. Documentation of the various strategies and interventions employed in Tiers 2 and 3, as well as all data pertaining to progress monitoring, will become part of the referral packet. Parents will be kept informed of planned intervention efforts and the student's progress in response to intervention throughout the entire SST process. Referral Procedures - Prior to a referral for students suspected of having a disability, school personnel will make one of the following determinations and include appropriate documentation in the student's educational record: 1. For students who present speech disorders; severe cognitive, physical, or sensory disorders; and/or severe social/behavioral deficits that require immediate attention to prevent harm to the student or others, the implementation of evidence- based interventions (including the parent involvement in the intervention procedures) and the observations of the student would be inappropriate in addressing the immediat e needs of the student. 2. The activities described in the general education intervention procedures above have been implemented but have been unsuccessful in addressing the areas of concern for the student. 3. The parents of the child receiving the general education interventions requested, prior to the completion of the interventions, will request TVHS conduct an evaluation to determine the child's eligibility for specially designed instruction and related services as a student with a disability. In this case, the activities described in the general education interventions procedures are completed concurrently with the evaluation but prior to the determination of the student's eligibility for specially designed instruction. In the instance significant risk fact ors are present or if the student demonstrates severe cognitive, physical or sensory impairments, or presents as a danger to self or others, an individual intervention plan should be developed as the child awaits the M ultidisciplinary Team evaluation. 5. How will you communicate the need for remediation to parents? TVHS will use various methods to share information with students and parents. Ongoing communication will be maintained through on -line reporting systems such as, web -based grade book and progress reports, parent conferences, and other forms of written and oral communication that the parents may prefer. TVHS will make every effort for communication to take place in the home language for those students from homes where a language other than English i s spoken. Academic Plan 83 Depending on the students program it could be weekly student behavior report s, parent teacher conferences, phone calls, and/or emails. Specifically, TVHS will ensure communication with students/parents occur as follows: \u00b7 Written Notices & Email: Parents will be notified, in writing, at any time during a grading period when: it is apparent that the student is doing unsatisfactory work; when course or grade assignments drop abruptly or significantly; if a student is in jeopardy of failing a course, and/or if a student is in jeopardy of not meeting promotion criteria. Parents will also be notified in writing when a student is receiving instruction in an accelerated class or grade placement other than for which they are eligible. \u00b7 Phone & In Pers on: Teacher and/or administrator will call parents with updates or concerns and/or request in -person conference. TVHS will also host an open house at the beginning of the s chool year wherein they will make parents aware of school policies, procedures, and how to request conferences. Parent conferences will be held as requested by parent s or as deemed necessary by teacher or administration. \u00b7 Interim Progress Reports: Parents receive an interim report between grading periods, which indicate student progress by course and contains academic, behavioral and attendance data. \u00b7 Parent Portal/ Online Gradebook: Parents have access to all the child's grades/assignments. \u00b7 Data Reports: MAP Scores, ACT, PSAT, SAT and reports of student individual performance and progress. \u00b7 School's Star Rating: (School Accountability Reports) will be made available to stakeholders and the community at -large via TVHS website and other means. Additionally, TVHS will coordinate parent workshops to bring parents into TVHS and invite o pen dialogue. TVHS will coordinate other appropriate methods of communication with parents/guardians, as necessary, and will make every effort to communicate with parents in their native language. TVHS will have a campus podcast to further open lines of communication with parents and families, as well as increase engagement on the portal. TVHS will meet this task by communicating available resources, announcement of upcoming engagement dates, contests, and giveaways to support families who are dealing with remediation. 6. What interventions will be offered for students exhibiting early signs of behavioral concerns? How will individual behavior plans for students be implemented and monitored? The classroom teacher is the first level of intervention for students with behavioral concerns. The teacher will collaborate with the student and parent/guardian to foster working relationships and promote positive classroom behaviors. TVHS teachers and st aff will use Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports ( PBIS ) along with Functional Assessment and Behavior Plans to determine why the behavior is being exhibited. Positive support paths will be demonstrated by all TVHS staff with the end -goal in mind to efficiently and appropriately correct student behavior issues. 1. Positive Behavioral Interventions and Support (PBIS), is beneficial for all students and provides effective tier one (1) interventions. Examples: set routines, silent signals, proximity, quiet corrections, giving students tasks, positive phrasing, take a break, state and explain the behavior that you want to see, and give out tangible reinforcers. Wellness Academic Plan 84 Wednesday's will also be utilized for students to meet with their mentor and/or the Student Success Team (SST).76 2. Individual Behavior plans, and Functional Assessment provide effective tier two (2) and three (3) interventions. Individual Behavior plans target a specific behavioral difficulty. The purpose of the plan is to systematically modify a student's environment with the goal of changing the student's behavior. Individual Behavior plans are most effective when they are based on functional behavior assessments. The function of a behavior describes what the student is getting out of a behavior and by gathering data and analyzing the antecedents and consequences, teachers can create lessons and strategies that produce positive change. Behavior plans will be developed, implemented by the school personnel, who daily, spend the most time with the student(s). Plans and implementation will be monitored by the SST. Interventions that will be offered for students exhibiting early signs of behavioral concerns are interventions that can be used in the classroom to positively reinforce student behavior for all students. The platform, Reach In, will be utilized to provide peer supports, counseling supports in the community, positive social groups, video content which promotes resiliency, problem solving strategies, and emotional intelligence. Special Education 1. Track Record: Please explain the extent to which one or more members of the founding school team (e.g., founding board, instructional leader, etc.) has experience working to achieve high academic outcomes of students with disabilities, including students w ith mild, moderate, and severe disabilities. One of TVHS's founding board members serves as an attorney for the Clark County School District in the Student Services Division (special education ) for her employment. Th is member research es legislation, policy, state statutes, and federal laws regarding IDEA and special education issues, as well as those relating to Section 50 4 of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA ). This board member ensures that the Clark County School District complies with all laws and policies in this area and advises schools on best practices to ensure compliance with the law and maintain high academic and behavioral standards for students with disabilities. This member has also been an inclusion teacher at the elementary level, focusing primarily on students with mild and moderate learning and behavioral disabilities. Another founding board member also works within the Student Services Division within the Clark County School District. The board member is current ly a Special Education Instructional Facilitator. Previously this member has been a self -contained teacher, focusing on students with mild/moderate and moderate/severe learning and behavioral disabilities. Other member experiences include licensed teachers who have worked with students of all levels of disabilities. The board also has members of the community serving in positions that give students with disabilities real life practical experiences, often furthering functional curriculum goals and 76 Fluke, S. & Peterson, R.

Academic Plan 85 objecti ves. For example, on e of its members is the CEO of Code Ninjas which helps students of all levels. 2. Identification: How will the school identify students in need of additional supports or services? TVHS will utilize the SST team when concerns have been expressed about an individual student's academic or behavioral needs. Prior intervention is used to assist the school in determining whether the student has needs that are able to be met within the general education setting without the need of special education supports/accommodations, or whether the student is suspected of having a disability and requires a more restrictive environment. (a) (Elementary Schools Only) How will the school accurately identify students prior to enrollment ( e.g., those who require pre -school special education and related services) and in the early grades (PreK, K, 1, or 2) for appropriate services? TVHS will be grades 9 -12 so this question is not applicable. (b) (Middle and High Schools) How will the school iden tify and serve students who require special education services and develop transition plans? TVHS will utilize the SST team when concerns have been expressed about an individual student's academic or behavioral needs. Prior intervention is used to assist the school in determining whether the student has needs that are able to be met within the general education setting without the need of special education supports/accommodations, or whether the student is suspected of having a disability and requires a mo re restrictive environment. If the student requires special education services , a meeting will be put together involving school administration, the school psychologist, teachers, parent/guardians, and other school personnel who are responsible for and work with student s who require assistance. TVHS will initiate procedures to evaluate the student for eligibility under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and the Nevada Administrative Code (NAC). This meeting is so all members can discuss and share information and ideas that will help the student succeed and improve the student's ability to participate in the general education classroom. For a student to qualify for special education services the student must have a disability and a unique learning need that cannot be met through the general education setting with appropriate accommodations and modifications. To determine eligibility, the team will complete the appropriate assessments and present and discuss the results. Once this is completed the team will determine whether the student has or continues to have one or more disabilities and whether the student has a unique learning need that requires special education services. For a smooth transition to adulthood, young people with disabilities need support, guidance, and planning. TVHS will help students with disabilities plan the future they want, pursue employment and/or higher education, and navigate the shift to adult life in the community. TVHS will utilize the time on Wellness Wednesdays to schedule a time with each student to develop, follow and successfully complete their unique transition plan to adulthood and future success . Academic Plan 86 (c) (All Schools ) How will the school handle over- identification of students as having a disability that qualifies them for special education services? What will be the process to transition a student out of special education who has been incorrectly identified as having a disability in the past? TVHS will consider assessing students for special education based on teacher feedback from the Response to Intervention process, parent concerns, or other staff member concerns. Students that are proving successful and are making continuous gains to achieve gr ade level success will not be assessed for special education if it appears that a suspected disability is not having any impact on academic success. However, the staff will consider the entire picture of each student individually. Initially, students with learning concerns will be placed in interventions to help the team determine the scope of the concern or a possible disability. This will help reduce an automatic reaction to put all struggling students in special education. Also, the determination of special education is a team decision, and all relevant factors will be considered, including the impact on student learning. TVHS will also utilize Section 504 Accommodation Plans in lieu of a formal Individualized Education Plan (IEP) if that is more appropri ate. If a student has been incorrectly identified as needing special education services, the team will make that determination at an \"exit IEP meeting.\" If the data supports the decision and the team agrees, the student will be ex ited from special educati on. A Section 504 Plan may be considered at that time if the student needs accommodations to help access the general education curriculum. It is important to note that the parent is an integral part of any IEP team decision, and their input will be taken into consideration along with the input of the other required team members and school staff. 3. Continuum of Services: How will the operator provide a broad continuum of instructional options and behavioral supports and interve ntions for students with a range of disabilities? Specifically describe how students with severe intellectual, learning, and/or emotional disabilities will be served. TVHS will continue to provide interventions and support for instructional and behavioral deficits. TVHS will have many opportunities to accommodate and modify with highly trained special education staff. Regarding students with severe intellectual, learning, and/or emotional disabilities TVHS would include these five best practices; inclusion , home -school collaboration, staff development, data -based instruction, and the criterion of ultimate functioning ( i.e., preparing students for their current and future environment). 4. General Education Collaboration/Access: How will special education and related service personnel collaborate with general education teachers (e.g., team teaching, team planning, etc.) to ensure that all students are able to access a rigorous general academic curriculum? TVHS will have bi -weekly meetings for general education teachers to meet with the special education team to collaborate and discuss what is working and what is not working. They will be able to answer any questions and assist with any accommodations, modifications, or assistance with planning lessons or behaviors . TVHS will plan student schedules accordingly and special education teachers will be able to push into classrooms to assist with student struggles during instruction. Academic Plan 87 5. Staffing: How will you ensure qualified staffing to meet the needs of students with dis abilities? Note: Federal and Nevada law requires licensure for the special education teachers, related service personnel, and psychologists at all charter schools. TVHS will hire staff that is highly qualified and endorsed in the areas needed for our stud ents and school to succeed. All teachers will have the required licenses or will follow all state guidelines regarding provisional licensing of special education teachers. 6. Staff Development: How does the school plan to train general education teachers to m odify the curriculum and instruction to address the unique needs of students with disabilities? General education teachers will have the opportunity to meet biweekly with the special education team. TVHS will have mandatory monthly staff developments to ma ke general education teachers knowledgeable about Individualized Education Plans (IEP s), accommodations, modifications, goals/benchmarks, and how to ensure they are being implemented. 7. Discipline: Explain how the school will protect the rights of students with disabilities in disciplinary actions and proceedings and exhaust all options in order to promote the continuation of educational services in the home school. Upon compliance with the provisions of NAC 388.265 , and the IDEA, no student with a disability will be suspended, expelled, or excluded from attendance if the suspension, expulsion, or exclusion results in a change of placement of the student during any school year. Before ini tiating any suspension, expulsion, or exclusion that will result in a change of placement , TVHS team will convene a meeting of relevant members as determined by the parent and the IEP team to hold a behavior manifestation determination. The purpose of this meeting is to determine whether the behavior of the student was a manifestation of the disability of the student. 8. Monitoring: What are your plans for monitoring and evaluating both the progress and success of students who qualify for special education an d related services, and the extent to which your special education program complies with relevant federal and state laws? How will curriculum and instructional decisions be tracked and monitored by IEP teams and school personnel? All special education teachers are required to keep data collection on student IEP goals and benchmarks. This is to determine if instruction is working or if it needs to be differentiated. Depending on the type of monitoring whether it is instructional or behavioral it could be collected daily, weekly, bi -monthly, or some other interval that is more appropriate for the goal. Behavior data is usually collected daily, and academic data is often collected once a week. This will be determined by TVHS's Special Education Team as the frequency that data is collected is related to how often measurable progress can be expected. 9. Parental Involvement: What appropriate programs, activities, and procedures will be implemented for the participation of parents of students with disabilities? TVHS will make sure to always send at least two prior notices/invitations to any upcoming IEP meetings. Regardless of the level of experience families may have with special education, TVHS will ensure that families are well informed as to what their rights are and what they can expect from TVHS. We value their partnership in their child's education and will host at least one Family Night Presentation for students and families to have an open and honest dialogue about special education concerns and share resources and information regarding IDEA and state policies, as well as our Academic Plan 88 own TVHS philosophy. The school will aim for families who will understand that TVHS is open to their suggestions and ideas and are all interested in achieving the same goal for their ch ild. 10. For Distance Education Schools: Describe how the school will provide appropriate services in the distance education learning environment to students with disabilities. If you are not proposing to operate a distance education or virtual school, pleas e explain that this is not applicable. TVHS will not be offering a full-time distance learning program at this time, this question is not applicable. 11. Please approximate how many students would qualify for these services. Please provide the rationale used in this approximation. As mentioned in Table 2.1 and Table 2.2 in \"Meeting the Need\", TVHS has estimated that 13% of the school's population will qualify for s pecial education services. English Language Learners 1. Identification: What methods will you employ to identify English Language Learners? How will you work to avoid misidentification? Local educational agents, ( LEAs ) must identify in a timely manner English learners in need of language assistance services. The Home Language Survey (HLS) used to identify potential English learners shall be included in the registration packet or given in a questionnaire to parents or guardians at the time of the student's enrollment. In Nevada, the Home Language Survey, at a minimum, must include the questions that meet the requirements in NAC 388.620 (Determination of primary language of pupil). Each school district shall identify the primary language of each pupil who enrolls in a school within the district for the first time . A pupil's primary language shall be deemed to be a language other than English if: a) The pupil first spoke a language other than English; b) The primary language spoken in the home of the pupil is not English; or c) The language most often spoken by the pupil is not English. In the implementation of this requirement, for students identified as potential English learners through the home language survey, the school administers an English language proficiency screener (WIDA screener, grades 1 - 12) to determine if the student qualifies as an English learner. Results from the assessment must be sent to parents or guardian within 30 calendar days at the beginning of the year, or within two weeks during the school year. After English learners have been identified using the English language proficiency screener, LEAs must offer to English learners EL services and programs until ELs are proficient in English and can 6 participate meaningfully in educational programs without EL support. Additionally, LEAs mus t provide appropriate special education services to English Learners with disabilities that are found to be eligible for special education and related services. Academic Plan 89 2. Placement: How will the results of the W -APT assessment and other identification and program placement decisions be communicated to staff and parents? Once students are assessed, the principal will ensure that eligible students are provided appropriate EL services. In addition, the principal or designees (EL L Teacher) will ensure that EL L students and their parents or guardians are aware of school activities and other opportunities at TVHS in a language they understand. Students who are eligible for EL L services will receive these services until it is determined, through re -evaluation procedures, that they possess adequate English language and academic skills to allow them to perform satisfactorily in general education classes without special instructional considerations. For students c lassified as Non -English or Limited English Proficient who are coded as non -English or limited English proficient because of the initial assessment, the followin g steps will be completed within the mandated timelines: 1. Classify students who are eligible for English Language Learner (EL L) services as Non - English or Limited English proficient. The students are eligible for EL L services. 2. Prepare a Parent Notification Letter. Once the parent receives the letter, they may choose to receive EL L instructional services. If the parent or guardian refuses EL instructional services, THVS will meet with the parent or guardian to ensure that the parent or guardian understand s what is being waived. Parents or guardians may only waive ELL instructional services - not testing. TVHS will document the parent conference and place a copy of the waiver in the cumulative student folder. 3. Students will be evaluated with the World -Class Instructional Design and Assessment's (WIDA) Assessing Comprehension and Communication in English State to State for English Language Learners (ACCESS). Students will receive an English Language Proficiency Level on a scale of 1 -6 (1 -Entering, 2- Emerging, 3-Developing, 4 -Expanding, 5 -Bridging, 6- Reaching). Teachers will utilize the score report to better differentiate instruction to meet the needs of each student. 4. Once students are assessed, the p rincipal will ensure that eligible students are provided appropriate EL services. In addition, Principals or designees will ensure that EL students and their parents or guardians are aware of school activities and other opportunities at TVHS in a language they understand. Students who are eligible for ELL services will receive these services until it is determined, through re- evaluation procedures, that they possess adequate English language and academic skills to allow them to perform satisfactorily in general education classes without special instruction al considerations. ELL Program Placement: TVHS will implement an EL L program of instruction in meeting the needs of the EL L population to be served. Program instruction will be designed to develop the student's mastery of the four language skills, including listening, speaking, reading, and writing, as rapidly as possible. TVHS will provide effective EL L instructional strategi es in all courses including mathematics, science, social studies, and computer literacy following state guidelines. 3. Staffing: How will you ensure qualified staffing to meet the needs of ELL students , conduct assessments, and monitor the progress of ELL st udents ? Note: Nevada law requires licensure (TESL endorsement) for the primary teacher providing ELL services in pull -out and inclusive environments at all charter schools. TVHS plans to hire an ELL endorsed i nstructor and an instructional aide to assis t. The ELL endorsed instructor will be responsible for all i nstructional plans and implement all accommodations as Academic Plan 90 designed by the program to meet state guidelines. A certificated and ELL endorsed c ounselor may assist with some testing and s upervision and ongoing monitoring. The ELL environment will be inclusive in all classes, with pull -out testing as required by the state of Nevada. TVHS is a school of acceptance and success for all. 4. Curriculum and Instruction: What specific instructional programs, practices, and strategies will be employed to ensure academic success and equitable access to the core academic program for English Language Learners? The program at TVHS for the ELL students will use an instructional software from the Pearson series. It has specific remedial, testing, redo, and additional instructional materials for the ELL students . This comes complete with an online, and in classroom model. It includes a udio, visual, and kinesthetic portions. In addition, it has a homework help section and parent portions as well. The Pearson program is used in many state and international schools because it is so inclusive of various levels and components. It is also culturally sensitive with reading, comprehension, and vocabulary. It also has some reteaching modules in every chapter, as well as practice exams prior to the actual exam. It has unit and yearly progression charts with correction strategies to follow. Pearson is a series that ELL students will easily adapt to along with other resources used by the instructor . Using the Pearson series allows for pacing, modeling, and specific tracking on all testing and data. It is a data driven program, backed by research and many years of proven practice by teachers of different cultures and countries. The ELL instructor will be using a student -centered approach with d irect instruction, multi- sensory learning, and project -based to meet the needs of the ELL students. The engage -activate model will allow for the student- teacher connection initially. The goal will be mastery and proficiency at the student's grade level. There will be some task -based learning, community language learning, and some communicative language teaching by the instructor . The instructor may also choose to apply the engage- study -activate model, as determined by the student's exposure to the language and need. For the ELL program to be effective, the students will be included in classes with regular expectations and given remedial ELL instruction as needed or referred by the instructor . All classes will have equal access to the ELL Instructor, and all students and classes will be included to ensure academic success. The ELL students will be identified in each class, and the expectation is the instructors in all classes will be directed to use the presentation, practice, and materials. TVHS will have a school wide instructor in-service and training. This will ensure equal access for ELL students to gain the knowledge they need to be successful, with the ELL teacher assisting them. All classes will be expected and supervised to include audio, visual and kinesthetic elements, with projects or assignments. These strategies will ensure academic success, and equitable access at TVHS. If a student is failing in a class, the identifying interventions can be put in place and a reteaching or extra help by the instructor can be instituted immediately. 5. Monitoring: What plans are in place for monitoring and evaluating the progress and success of ELL students, including the process for exiting students from ELL services as needed? TVHS will progress monitor EL L students on a regular basis using data to tr ack their progress. In addition, EL L students will be reassessed every year to determine whether the pupil's proficiency in English is fluent and whether they are able to succeed in courses of study that are taught only in English. TVHS will monitor all re classified students for a minimum of two years after they have met Academic Plan 91 language proficiency. The student must be given the test , ACCESS for ELLs , every year until the student exits the E LL program. Parents or guardians of LEP children do not have the option of withdrawing their student from participating in the ACCESS for ELLs. TVHS may reclassify an EL L student only if the s chool administers the ACCESS for ELLs to assess the pupil's proficiency to comprehend, speak, read, and write English. Afterward, the pupil will obtain a score on the examination that is equal to or greater than a score for a person who is fluent in speaking , reading, and writing English, as established by the publisher of the examination. TVHS will monitor any students reclassified as English proficient who have not yet met exit criteria . TVHS will ensure that reclassified students are appropriately placed in general education classes and TVHS will monitor a student reclassified as fluent -English proficient, but who has not yet met exit criteria, for no less than two years. The purpose of this monitoring is to ensure that the students maintain success in any academic class and are no longer in need of language acquisition assistance. The monitoring from TVHS will include periodic contact with the student's teacher(s) to ascertain student progress. TVHS will also review the student's report card annually to review the student's attendance, academic and citizenship grades. To be considered academically successful, a student should have no grades below a \"C\" in English, reading, math, science, or social studies. Specific consideration for language proficiency must be tak en into consideration in planning specific interventions for the student. If, because of monitoring, evidence indicates that the student is not successful in English -only classes and needs further language acquisition assistance , TVHS will administer the i nitial assessment test to ascertain the student's current English proficiency. A meeting will be held with the student's parents or guardians and the student will be considered for reinstatement into the EL L program, into an academic remediation program, o r the student will remain in English -only classes. TVHS will continue to monitor the student for language and academic progress. If the student is determined to be academically unsuccessful, TVHS and the appropriate teachers will seek out other services fo r the student to address any academic deficiencies. Prior to making any changes, the principal or designee will meet with the parents or guardians to discuss the recommended changes. 6. Parental Involvement: What appropriate programs, activities, and proce dures will be implemented for the participation of parents of ELLs? Parents of students attending TVHS will begin the year with understanding the EL L services provided at the school. In addition, they will be informed of and sign the learning compact (tran slated to accommodate all individual language learners). Parents of EL Ls will be invited to attend school -wide events. Access to programs and activities in the parents' primary language will be provided when necessary. Additionally, parents of students ide ntified as EL L will receive weekly progress reports regarding the growth that their child is demonstrating. The EL L Teacher will notify parents via phone, letter, or email when a formal meeting should be held to discuss their child's EL L progress. Parents of ELL students will receive monthly calls from their general education teacher to discuss the progress of their child and to celebrate academic accomplishments. These one -on-one conversations allow for parents to get to know their child's teacher and to a sk questions or share their perspective on various matters. If the teacher is not fluent in the home Academic Plan 92 language of the parent, a translator will be provided by TVHS to ensure that this necessary communication takes place. TVHS plans to use potential Title II I funding and SB390 (Sec. 3114(a) and 3114(c) to support programs designed for parental involvement of TVHS's English Learners.77 7. For Distance Education Schools: Describe how the school will provide appropriate services in the distance education learning environment to ELLs. If you are not proposing to operate a distance education or virtual school, please explain that this is not applicable. TVHS will have a program for in class instruction, and a hybrid model that will allow students to be online distance learning two days a week. Students with the hybrid model will be communicating with the ELL instructor daily . The testing and parent conferences will be completed at school in the in-class days. This will involve the ELL instructor, a dministra tion, and the classroom teachers. The ELL instructor will partner with the classroom teachers and provide the necessary online instruction per subjects needed at the appropriate level of instruction for the limited English, and non- English proficient stude nts. There will be checks and balances in the ELL program and the instructor for the ELL students. Teachers of the online program will be using the same strategies and methodology as the classroom teachers. 8. Please approximate how many students would qualify for these services. Please provide the rationale used in this approximation. TVHS will be expecting 30 % based on current school enrollment and the enrollment filled out by the students and the parents completing the intent to enroll data. TVHS is expecting to hire an ELL teacher to screen the newly enrolling students. The c ounselor will also review all transcripts and records of incoming students for previous enrolling in ELL at prior schools. Students transferring credits from other schools will also be interviewed as they register for classes. Parents will also be consulted for the newly enrolling students. TVHS anticipates approximately 98 ELL students in a school of 325 at the open ing of the school year . However, TVHS predicts the students will have different developing levels of English with some students requiring more and others requiring less remediation. TVHS anticipate s hiring Special Education Instructional Aide (s) to assist the ELL Instructor. TVHS anticipates students will exit the program as they master the proficiency of the grade level expectations. Classroom Instructors may refer students to the ELL program as needed. Homeless/Migrant Services 1. Identification: What methods will you employ to identify famili es who qualify for homeless and/or migrant services? How will you work to avoid misidentification? TVHS is planning an individual interview for all new students enrolling, to review their needs, home address, and family situation. This involves their cur rent credit status, former schools, and school records. By doing this entrance interview, TVHS will be able to identify migrant and homeless students and place them into our school with the appropriate resources. A parent will be required 77 Nevada Department of Education. (2020). Guidance Document for Title III English Learners and Immigrant Students. Retrieved from https://doe.nv.gov/uploadedFiles/ndedoenvgov/content/English_Language_Learners(ELL)/Guidance_Docu ment_TitleIII.pdf Academic Plan 93 to attend the entrance interview with the student, at which time a full review of the needs will be assessed. TVHS will have a Special Education teacher and an ELL specialist available. Additionally , the counselor will have community resources and be able to refer needy st udents to the appropriate services needed. Project 150 Community Room will be located within TVHS and will be accessible to all students. 2. Meeting the Need: How will you ensure that identified families receive the required services within the mandated tim eframe? To ensure the students and families receive the services, there will be a follow up check by the counselor, and the mentors with the student within three weeks of any new student entering. This will include the school specialist, and a home contact made via phone, zoom or email to maximize services. The 3- week check will be recommended and noted for all new students and adjustments will be made to classes, services, or mentors, as needed. 3. For Distance Education Schools: Describe how the school will provide appropriate services in the distance education learning environment to students who qualify for homeless and/or migrant services. If you are not propo sing to operate a distance education or virtual school, please explain that this is not applicable. TVHS will not be providing full time distance education ; however, TVHS will provide a h ybrid model, those students will be following the same process as out lined above. To ensure TVHS are providing migrant and homeless students online services we will require the same personal interview with a parent. In addition, TVHS is requiring a signed agreement by the student and parent. This means, students in all classes online ( two days a week only) must have a daily presence and maintain specified assignments. The student will be required at TVHS to be in resource classes, and the same 3- week check and assessment will be made by the mentors and c ounselor. Online students not complying with the TVHS agreement will be required to attend full time classroom, and thus forfeit the online privilege of two days a week. Additionally, the in -person time three days a week will give students access to additi onal personal services for the Migrant and Homeless students. The services will be in accordance with Nevada state law. SCHOOL STRUCTURE: CULTURE 1. Describe the culture or ethos of the proposed school. Explain how it will promote a positive academic enviro nment and reinforce student intellectual and social development. TVHS's mission, vision, and core values are the foundation of the culture and climate of the school. TVHS strives to commit to diversity and social awareness, as well as to academic achievement and excellence. Mission: The Village High School (TVHS) transforms the lives of graduates by offering a high -quality education in conjunction with coping, decision -making, and practical life skills that lead to grit and perseverance and better unders tanding of what it takes to be successful in the world. TVHS' culture will create a safe space for all students, including LGBTQ+ students and their allies. Vision: We are a charter school that is committed to creating and sustaining and exceptional educ ation for students whose needs cannot be met in traditional environments. Academic Plan 94 TVHS's mission and vision consist of five core beliefs: 1. Students cannot learn if they do not feel safe.7879 2. Many students are in desperate need of counseling and mental health services at school.80 3. Formative assessment and data drive instruction. 4. High quality teachers, curriculum, student engagement, and materials increase student growth. 5. Professional development that is focused and thoughtful is vital to the success of the sch ool. TVHS proposes to give families the ability to attend a quality high school in which students feel in charge of their learning, safe, and mentally healthy. Our unique model will transform education for diverse and traditionally underserved student pop ulations. 2. Explain how you will create and implement this culture for students, teachers, administrators, and parents starting from the first day of school. Describe the plan for enculturating students who enter the school mid -year. The creation and implementation of TVHS's school culture will start during student enrollment and the hiring of faculty and staff. School culture is not created overnight, but rather born from the school's vision, beliefs, values, and mission.81 Through TVHS's mission and vision, the culture will develop and grow through the accumulation of actions and traditions that align. Students and their families will be immersed in the norms and expectations of TVHS from the moment they step foot on campus. Students wi ll participate in activities that encourage acceptance and diversity, as well as communication development. Parents /guardians will be enculturated through the enrollment process, reading, and agreeing to the student and parent handbook, and direct weekly c ommunication with school faculty and staff. Faculty and staff enculturation begins in the interview and hiring process. Because TVHS's mission and vision focus on creating a safe space, as well as social emotional learning and mental health counseling, applicants will be asked to share their personal educational philosophies including their viewpoints on equitable curriculum and pedagogical beliefs. Creating the type of culture, the School Board envisions starts at the top. The principal will be instrumental in creating the structures and procedures within the school that truly embody the vision of TVHS. A strong administrative team that constantly and clearly communicates the \"why\" behind decisions and the purpose of TVHS is essential. Once a strong leadership team has been established, all other hiring decisions will fall into place to align with TVHS's vision and culture. Applicants who share similar beliefs to TVHS and alignment to the school's mission and vision will be considered for employment. Facu lty and staff enculturation will continue throughout the school year by professional development implementations and team collaboration. During team collaboration, student academic and 78 GLSEN.

Retrieved from http://www.ascd.org/publications/books/111014/chapters/Creating -Culture -in- Schools.aspx Academic Plan 95 emotional growth will be discussed to continue to build and enforce school culture. These daily sessions will provide the necessary support and interventions for all learners. 3. Please describe how you will evaluate school culture and evaluate implementation of your culture plan. Include how parent and student feedback will be incorporated in measuring your school's success in creating a positive culture. Assessing school culture should be intentional, completed anonymously and individually. These assessments will help to gain an understanding of cultural behaviors or markers of the overall culture of the learning community. In addition, school culture is the shared experiences both in school and out of school, creating a sense of community, family, and team membership, and will be measured through observations from all stakeho lders. 82 TVHS will measure school culture and evaluate implementation using a survey that will be collected twice a year. Assessments on school culture will ask questions related to and attitudes towards school culture. Qualitative data will be collected, analyzed, and aggregated with all TVHS school leaders, board members, and faculty and staff. The results of the survey will be used to shape pathways to school improvement, promote individual professional development, and implement the school's core values. 4. Describe the school's approach to help support all students' social and emotional needs. Detail the identification strategy, interventions, and remediation to be implemented and cite the research/rationale for the selected methods. TVHS's s econdary program model is to provide a rigorous, innovative, and hands -on core curriculum, as well as a social -emotional learning program which focuses on individual and internal growth. Classroom teachers will also mentor students weekly during dedicated one -on-one sessions. During these mentoring sessions students will set long and short -term goals with their mentor. These sessions will foster strong relationships between students and mentors as they celebrate successes and discuss learning opportunitie s from roadblocks they need to overcome. The TVHS elective choice for our secondary programming is the SEED Impact Program. SEED Impact is a program that focuses on internal growth utilizing Social Emotional Learning (SEL). SEL intentionally develops a ttitudes, behaviors, and skills that are fundamental for academic and life success. SEL programming incorporates the two essential benefits as mentioned above. Educators, policymakers, and employers, alike, believe that SEL is key to optimizing education and training. Working in partnership with the stage -model framework, SEED Impact, will be customized and integrated with our programming to measure, credibly report, and accelerate the learning experience of program participants. With a focus on life -transformations, SEED Impact's approach tracks major shifts in competency measured across three domains of growth as mentioned above. 82 Wagner, C. (2007). The School Leader's Tool FOR ASSESSING AND IMPROVING SCH OOL CULTURE. Retrieved from https://www.redorbit.com/news/education/847037/the_school_leaders_tool_for_assessing_and_improving_ school_culture/ Academic Plan 96 SEED Impact will guide TVHS's leadership team to customize three competency ladders (being, doing and relating) to clarify co re SEL practices in alignment with TVHS's mission and program outcomes. At the start and end of each program year, program staff will use the competency ladders to assess each learner's performance. Learners will also self -assess their experience. Combi ning these two complementary survey tools thus strengthens the validity and reliability of the measurement with SEED Impact and amplifies the benefits derived by each participant. In customizing the assessments, TVHS will build on the tools, research, and reporting that have already done. The intent is to simplify and reduce the work on staff as SEED Impact guides TVHS to effectively implement this advanced approach to SEL measurement and accelerated learner growth. Once tools are refined and made operational, SEED Impact will provide data analysis and a dynamic report reflecting TVHS's brand and tailored for specific audiences as requested. Overall, TVHS will be equipped to report the impacts that most powerfully capture the work while generating action able data to guide learners to increasingly higher levels of competency. The integration of this approach within our programming will afford increased self -reflection and exemplify the experience of our program as a learning community. Staff, instructors, and participants will come to share a common, clarifying language that enables the learner to understand \"where I am\" in my personal growth, in relation to \"where I want to be\" and \"what I can do next to grow into more of my potential.\" Recognition and c elebration of student successes will ignite deeper learning. Overall, SEED Impact's approach provides an integrated \"mental map\" of the entire program's landscape, and a concise way to portray and talk internally and externally about the program. TVHS will gain holistic rather than piecemeal reporting of results, grounded in SEL research. The work with SEED Impact is less about evaluation and more about the opportunity for staff, leaders, participants, parents, and funders to apprehend the power of its program. As more of the programs are implemented over time, TVHS will share common language and a unifying framework. SEED Impact reports will combine impact data with stories and photos to convey how each program and the organization is changing lives. 83 SCHOOL STRUCTURE: STUDENT DISCIPLINE 1. Describe the school's discipline policy. Discuss the practices the school will use to promote good discipline, including both penalties for infractions and incentives for positive behavior. TVHS promotes a productive learning environment with positive staff/student interactions rich in rituals and traditions that support the school's philosophy and mission. The school's culture and climate are built around positive reinforcement for empathetic behavior, personal acco untability, clear standards of conduct, and the expectancy of good character. TVHS's discipline plan calls for the restorative and progressive discipline of pupils and onsite review of disciplinary decisions. Restorative justice means nonpunitive interven tion and support 83 The Aspen Institute. (2017). The Evidence Base for How We Learn, Council of Distinguished Scientists National C ommission on Social, Emotional, and Academic Development. Retrieved from https://www.seedimpact.org/social -emotional -learning Academic Plan 97 provided by the school to a pupil to improve the behavior of the pupil and remedy any harm caused by the pupil (AB 168). Restorative disciplinary practices include holding a pupil accountable for their behavior; restoration or remedies rel ated to the behavior of the pupil, relief for any victim of the pupil; and changing the behavior of the pupil (SB 89). The plan has been developed in accordance with written rules of behavior prescribed in NRS 392.463, NRS 392.4644, and NRS 392.466. It includes, without limitation, provisions designed to address the specific disciplinary needs and concerns of TVHS. The plan provides for the temporary removal of a pupil from a classroom in accordance with NRS 392.4645. Once operational, TVHS will provide a copy of the plan to every staff member, and include it in the student/parent handbook, which will be posted electronically on the school website for public inspection. TVHS holds the following beliefs and policies concerning student disciplinary procedur es: \u00b7 Each student is a person deserving of the opportunity to correct their wrongdoings and to learn from their mistakes. \u00b7 Each staff member develops positive relationships with students, helping create a supportive environment where students thrive personally and academically. \u00b7 Students are held accountable for their behavior. \u00b7 A fair and thorough investigation will be conducted, including an attempt to discover underlying issues associated with the offense. \u00b7 A plan of action based on restorative justice will b e designed for students with the goal to address underlying issues associated with the offense, change and/or improve the behavior of the student and remedy or \"make right\" any harm caused by the student to others. \u00b7 The feelings of the person harmed by a st udent's behavior or actions must be considered in the plan of action. \u00b7 Continued support will be provided to both the person harmed and the offender. \u00b7 Search methods and investigatory techniques must comply with the applicable law and TVHS policies and regul ations. \u00b7 The Restorative Plan of Action, including progressive disciplinary action, must be commensurate with the severity of the offense(s). \u00b7 A student's Restorative Plan of Action, academic and disciplinary chronology must be considered, except in the even t of mandatory expulsion offenses as provided for in Nevada Revised Statutes. \u00b7 The school's administration is provided, by TVHS's School Board, with the authorization and discretion to make and implement disciplinary decisions and interventions, including b ut not limited to, suspension and recommendations for expulsion, except for mandatory expulsion offenses required by Nevada Revised Statutes, for all TVHS students. \u00b7 A Restorative Plan of Action, behavior contract, group and individualized counseling, Requ ired Parent Conferences (RPC), referrals, detention, temporary assignment to an alternative placement, intervention with social workers, parent conferences, and attendance notification may all be utilized, as appropriate. Academic Plan 98 In the case of referrals, which are cumulative throughout the school year, the progression of discipline is contemplated as follows: 1) Student removed from class, see s an administrator. 2) Student removed from class, sees an administrator, and calls home. 3) Student removed from class, sees administrator, calls home, is placed on Required Parent Conference (RPC) status, or suspended immediately depending on the infraction, and may not return without a parent attending school with the student for the entire day. Return day is determined by the administrator and parent. 4) Suspension is defined as either at -home suspension or in -school suspension as deemed appropriate by the principal or principal's designee. 5) Suspensions for similar infractions will result in multiple day suspensions. 6) Suspended students will not be allowed to attend or participate in athletics or school activities on the days of suspension. 7) Suspended students will not be on the honor roll for that quarter. \u00b7 Any student who receives four or more disciplinary referrals will not be allo wed to attend any field trips without a parent accompanying them for the day. These students will also be suspended from all school activities. \u00b7 RPC means that either a student- administrator conference (in the case of a student who is 18 or older) or a parent -student -administrator conference will take place. At the time of notice, the school administrator will specify if the required meeting must be held prior to the student's return to campus OR if the student may continue to attend school on campus until the meeting is held. \u00b7 The student should be present whenever possible. \u00b7 All parent conferences held because of student disciplinary issues will include students/parents being given notice of the charges against him or her, an explanation of the evidence, and an opportunity for the administrator to hear information and a defense from the student/parent (a hearing). A parent conference must be held prior to a suspension. \u00b7 Temporary Alternative Placement (TAP) can be either off -site in the online environment only or can be onsite with the direct supervision of a teacher, the school counselor, the school social worker or the school administrator. \u00b7 Every attempt must be made to contact a parent/guardian for each significant offense. Parents must be provided with written notification for all Restorative Plans of Action and disciplinary actions. \u00b7 Suspensions may be assigned at the discretion of the principal, up to a maximum of ten school days. \u00b7 Referrals of expulsion require formal due process. Due process includes a parent conference, which will include notice of the charges against the student, an explanation of the evidence, an opportunity for the administrator to hear information and a defense from the student/parent (a hearing), and an opportunity for appeal. An appeal can be made to the TVHS School Board. \u00b7 If the principal believes a crime may have been committed, law enforcement must be notified. Records of police involvement must be requested and maintained. Any criminal Academic Plan 99 action taken by law enforcement is separ ate, and not always parallel to administrative action taken by the school. \u00b7 Additionally, a manifestation determination and functional behavioral assessment must be conducted if the student's behavior is, or will potentially, inhibit the student's access to Free Appropriate Public Education (FAPE). (2) Describe the procedures for due process when a student is suspended or expelled as a result of a code of conduct violation, including a description of the appeal process that the school will employ for students facing expulsion. Suspension Suspension is the temporary removal of a student from school for dangerous and/or antisocial behavior. When circumstances warrant , students who must be removed from a classroom or playground should be kept at school to partic ipate in as much of the program as possible. The primary purpose of suspension is to give the student, the student's parent(s), and the school the time needed for resolving a problem. The parents must be notified in writing of each suspension. Reasonable effort will be made to contact the parent(s) before the student leaves the school if the student leaves during school hours. Duration and conditions of suspensions are as follows: Since the time and actions needed to resolve problems depend on individual c ircumstances, the duration of suspension shall in all cases be related to a course of action designed to resolve the problem. The duration shall be specified in advance only when known factors preclude immediate resolution. The student shall be readmitted as soon as the school has reasonable assurance that the problem has been resolved or significantly improved. TVHS may impose appropriate requirements relating to parental contacts, the student's future behavior at a school, and schoolwork to be done during suspension as outlined in school regulations. A Notice of Suspension form is to be used by the principal or assistant principal, when a student is being placed on suspension, including in cases of a more serious nature or when circumstances may warrant fu rther action, such as referral to the online program, or an expulsion recommendation or removal. Within three school days of suspension, a conference with the student, parent or guardian, and principal or assistant principal is to be held. No student is to be on suspension more than ten school days before a decision or recommendation is made. If a recommendation for the online or expulsion is made, the suspension will remain in effect until the final disposition of the online program or expulsi on recommendation. Students on suspension are not allowed on a school campus or at any school sponsored activity for any reason without the express prior permission of the school principal. When a student is placed on a suspension for any offense, the appropriate administrator will read the following statement to the student and will verify that act by making a notation on the suspension form: Academic Plan 100 \"As the duly appointed representative of the owner of all school district property, I hereby warn you that should you come on this property during the term of this suspension without the express prior permission of the principal, you will be trespassing upon this property as defined by the Nevada Revised Statute 207.200 and will be subject to arrest for a misdemea nor.\" Expulsion Expulsion is the removal of a student from school for dangerous and/or antisocial behavior. The procedure for determining whether a student should be recommended for expulsion is set forth below: 1. The principal shall report any violation of the law to the appropriate law enforcement agency. \"Principal\" as used in this section means the principal or their designee. 2. The principal or designee shall suspend the student by use of a \"Notice of Suspension\" pending further investigation by administr ation and review of the facts, which may lead to a recommendation for expulsion. 3. Within three school days of the suspension, the principal or designee, must conduct a hearing with the student and the student's parent(s) or legal guardian(s), to discuss the investigation of the incident, the violation of school rules and/or regulations, and the student's prior discipline history, as well as any information submitted that the parent(s) or legal guardian(s) would like the principal to consider as it relates to the suspension and the possible recommendation for expulsion. 4. At the conclusion of the hearing, the principal or designee shall make a decision regarding the disciplinary action, which may include removal from the day school and placed in the online progr am or a recommendation for expulsion. The principal or designee must recommend expulsion if it is determined at the hearing the student has or is believed to have committed any of the following offenses: Battery on a school employee; Battery to a student w ith significant injury; Possession of a firearm, including a weapon as defined by the Gun -Free Schools Act or any weapon deemed to be dangerous and/or; Possession of drugs or alcohol with intent to distribute, which require a mandatory recommendation for expulsion. 5. If the student is to be recommended for expulsion, the parent(s) or legal guardian(s) must be informed of the due process procedures available. The parent(s) or legal guardian(s) must decide whether to contest or not contest the expulsion and sig n a statement to that effect. If the parent does not sign the statement, the expulsion will be treated as a contested expulsion. 6. The parent(s) or legal guardian(s) will be provided in writing with the due process procedures available. These procedures will be provided during the hearing with the principal or designee, or with the written decision. The following levels of due process are available to the parent(s) or legal guardian(s) of a student who is being recommended for expulsion: 1. A hearing will be conducted by the school principal, or designee. The principal will disclose information obtained during the investigation of the incident which resulted in the recommendation for expulsion. This information, as well as the student's prior disciplinary Academic Plan 101 record, will be reviewed with the student and the parent(s) or legal guardian(s). The parent(s) or legal guardian(s) must be allowed to present any information to the principal that the parent(s) or legal guardian(s) would like the principal to consider. The student must also be allowed to be heard regarding the incident resulting in the recommendation for expulsion. 2. At the conclusion of the hearing, the principal shall inform the parent(s) or legal guardian(s) of the decision and must within two (2) school days following the hearing provide written notice to the parent(s) or legal guardian of the decision regarding the recommended expulsion. 3. The School Board must make the following determinations: i. What disciplinary offense, if any, has been co mmitted by the student; and ii. If the student has committed a disciplinary offense, what is the appropriate consequence and educational placement considering the nature of the offense, the student's disciplinary history for one (1) calendar year prior to the date of the subject offense, as well as the student's overall academic record or any other academic concerns. iii. The decision of the School Board is final and binding. (3) Describe the process for completing a plan of action based on restorative justice prior to engaging in suspension and/or expulsion proceedings as required under Assembly Bill 168 (2019). TVHS's discipline plan calls for the restorative and progressive discipline of pupils and onsite review of disciplinary decisions. Restorative justice means nonpunitive intervention and support provided by the school to a pupil to improve the behavior of the pupil and remedy any harm caused by the pupil (AB 168). Restorative disciplinary practices include holding a pupil accountable for their be havior; restoration or remedies related to the behavior of the pupil, relief for any victim of the pupil; and changing the behavior of the pupil (SB 89). The plan has been developed in accordance with written rules of behavior prescribed in NRS 392.463, NRS 392.4644, and NRS 392.466. It includes, without limitation, provisions designed to address the specific disciplinary needs and concerns of TVHS. The plan provides for the temporary removal of a pupil from a classroom in accordance with NRS 392.4645. Once operational, TVHS will provide a copy of the plan to every staff member, and include it in the student/parent handbook, which will be posted electronically on the school website for public inspection. TVHS holds the following beliefs and policies concerning student disciplinary procedures: \u00b7 Each student is a person deserving of the opportunity to correct their wrongdoings and to learn from their mistakes. \u00b7 Each staff member develops positive relationships with students, helping create a supportive environm ent where students thrive personally and academically. \u00b7 Students are held accountable for their behavior. \u00b7 A fair and thorough investigation will be conducted, including an attempt to discover underlying issues associated with the offense. Academic Plan 102 \u00b7 A plan of action b ased on restorative justice will be designed for students with the goal to address underlying issues associated with the offense, change and/or improve the behavior of the student and remedy or \"make right\" any harm caused by the student to others. \u00b7 The feelings of the person harmed by a student's behavior or actions must be considered in the plan of action. \u00b7 Continued support will be provided to both the person harmed and the offender. \u00b7 Search methods and investigatory techniques must comply with the applicab le law and TVHS policies and regulations. \u00b7 The Restorative Plan of Action, including progressive disciplinary action, must be commensurate with the severity of the offense(s). \u00b7 A student's Restorative Plan of Action, academic and disciplinary chronology must be considered, except in the event of mandatory expulsion offenses as provided for in Nevada Revised Statutes. \u00b7 The school's administration is provided, by TVHS's School Board, with the authorization and discretion to make and implement disciplinary decisions and interventions, including but not limited to, suspension and recommendations for expulsion, except for mandatory expulsion offenses required by Nevada Revised Statutes, for all TVHS students. \u00b7 A Restorative Plan of Action, behavior contract, group and individualized counseling, Required Parent Conferences (RPC), referrals, detention, temporary assignment to an alternative placement, intervention with social workers, parent conferences, and attendance notification may all be utilized, as appropriate. (4) Who will be responsible for implementing the school's discipline policy, including ensuring that accurate disciplinary records are maintained, and that discipline data Is reported to the SPCSA ? The principal will be ultimately respon sible for implementing the school's discipline policy but may delegate to the assistant principal as appropriate . (5) How will the school track discipline data and how will this data be used make needed changes for school culture? What actions does the school plan to take in order to monitor for and prevent disparities in discipline practices between student groups ? For CMO applicants, and applicants intending to contract with a CMO or EMO, describe how the schools currently affiliated with the CMO/EMO have monitored for and addressed any disparities in discipline practices between student groups. Maintenance and reporting of TVHS's disciplinary records will be administered by the principal or their designee. The School Board will pr ovide oversight of the principal as appropriate. The data will be used to identify t rends or significant numbers of certain disciplinary problems or trends in student demographics . When such issues are identified, further investigation and evaluation will be undertaken to determine root causes and whether changes to the school environment or culture should be made to obviate such issues. TVHS's response will be dictated by the data. Academic Plan 103 (6) Describe the school's proposed parent grievance policy. TVHS values open and proactive communication among and between the members of the school community, including parents, students, faculty, staff, administration, and the School Board. Issues that are not dealt with directly can become destructive to the school community and, therefore, detrimental to the learning process of our students. The adults in TVHS community must model for their students a willingness to address conflict directly, respectfully, and at the lowest level possible, whenever possible. As such, TVHS will create a grievance policy consisting of four steps that is designed for settling differences in a prompt and equitable manner. These procedures guide how any adult member of the schoo l community - parent, employee (faculty or non- faculty ), administrator, or other adult - is expected to express grievances about other members of the community. The school's administration and School Board both expect that conflict will be addressed and proactively dealt with following the fewest number of steps possible. The steps include: 1. addressing the situation directly with the other person(s) involved, 2. enlisting the assistance of an administrator to assist in facilitating a resolution , 3. preparing a wri tten grievance for the principal, who then reviews and acts upon that grievance as appropriate; and 4. preparing a written grievance for the School Board, who then may choose to hear additional information at a b oard meeting and will ultimately make a final decision, not subject to appeal. It is important to emphasize that in most cases the TVHS School Board will not become involved in a grievance until the final step of the process. Board members are encouraged to refer any member of the school community who may approach them with a grievance to the school's grievance policy and the proper process for resolving the issue. (7) Discuss any required dress code or uniform policy. Student dress, personal appearance, and conduct are required to be of such character as not to disrupt or detract from the educational environment of the school. Any style that tends to diminish instructional effectiveness or discipline control by a teacher is not acceptable. TVHS dress code is in accordance with Clark County School Dist rict Regulation 5131. The school administration shall have the right to designate which types of dress, fashion, fads, or appearance disrupt or detract from the educational program and may be a potential safety hazard. The specific requirements and prohibi tions are: Students must wear shoes with soles. Slippers and sandals are not permitted. Shirts and blouses must be appropriately buttoned in accordance with the design of the shirt or blouse. Length must extend beyond the belt level with no skin showing between bottom of shirt/blouse and top of pants or skirts. Crop tops, and clothing that is strapless, low -cut or has slits, or tops and outfits that provide minimum coverage or that are transparent, are not permitted. Academic Plan 104 All attire may be no more than two inches above the knee. If shorts are worn, they must be hemmed and without fraying. Cutoffs are not permitted. Skin should not be visible more than two inches above the knee. No spaghetti straps are permitted. All sleeveless shirts must have straps covering the shoulder. Prohibit slogans or advertising on clothing, which by their controversial ( e.g., Iron Cross) or obscene nature disrupt the educational setting. This includes any clothing that advertises racial bigotry and sexual activities, tobacco products, alcoholic beverages, or drugs; jewelry; wallet chains; or any gang -related clothing. Coats, mittens, and scarves must be removed upon entering the building. Pants may not be worn in a sagging fashion that displays private undergarments, or any attire that is not conducive to the educational setting of TVHS . No undergarments may be displayed. If a student's pants do not fit at the waist, the student will need to wear a belt. Sunglasses may not be worn inside the building. Any student violating the dress code will not be allowed to attend class. The principal may make an exception to this aspect of the policy if the offending shirt or blouse can be worn inside out or covered up by another article of clothing. The goal is to find solutions before immediately interrupting the student's classroom instruction. Continuous violations will result in Required Parent Conferences and/ or suspensions. The principal shall retain the authority to grant exceptions for special occasions and/or conditions. SCHOOL STRUCTURE: CALENDAR AND SCHEDULE (8) As Attachment 3, pro vide the annual academic schedule for the school (included in the student/parent handbook). Explain how the calendar reflects the needs of the student population and the educational model. Please see Attachment 3 TVHS's school calendar meets the requirements of the Nevada Department of Education. 2022 - 2023 Academic School Calendar 2022 August 8 Students Return September 5 Labor Day October 10 Columbus Day Academic Plan 105 October 28 Nevada Day October 31 Halloween November 11 Veteran 's Day November 23 - 25 Thanksgiving December 26 - January 6 Holiday Break (last day 12/23, return 1/9) 2023 January 1, 2023 New Year 's Day January 16 Martin Luther King Day February 20 President's Day March 17 St. Patrick 's Day April 3 - 10 Spring Break (classes resume 4/11) May 26 Last Day of School May 30 Memorial Day (9) Describe the structure of the school day and week , including the length of the school day, start times, and dismissal times. Include the number of instructional minutes/hours in a day for core subjects such as language arts, mathematics, science, and social studies. Explain why the school's daily and weekly schedule will be optimal for the school model and for student learni ng. Provide the minimum number of hours/minutes per day and week that the school will devote to academic instruction in each grade. Figure 3.2 demonstrates a sample block schedule for TVHS's students. The principal and faculty will continue to refine the schedule to meet the needs of the students and future growth of the school. Academic Plan 106 TVHS plans to implement block schedules for students. According to NEA,84 having block schedules has its advantages by providing more of a \"sane school day.\" These advantages include: \u00b7 Teachers have time to plan lessons, projects, etc. \u00b7 Teachers will see fewer students throughout the day allowing for more individualized instruction. \u00b7 Teachers and students have more time to do more hands -on learning and collaboration, mentor/mentee and/or peer mentoring sessions. \u00b7 Extended teaching/learning time allows for longer cooperative learning activities and completion of project -based learni ng. Figure 3.3 shows TVHS's weekly schedule. This includes \"Wellness Wednesday\" which will include time to focus on Social Emotional Learning and mental health curricula and will offer student - driven activities that promote self -care. Wellness Wednesday will also provide opportunities for teachers, students, and other adult mentors to check- in with one another and build mentor/mentee relationships. 84 Walker, T. (2016). Are Block Schedules the Stress -Buster S tudents -students - need Figure 3.2: Block Schedule Sample Academic Plan 107 (10) Describe your goal for student attendance and explain how you will ensure high rates of student attendance. Who will be responsible for collecting and monitoring attendance data? What supports will be in place to reduce tru ancy and chronic absenteeism? TVHS offers a pro -active approach to reduce absences by providing a safe and accepting space for all students. For example, s tudents who feel safe and welcomed at school will tend to want to co me to school as opposed to those who do not . Attendance Enforcement for Secondary School Students' Grades 9 -12 85 a) All students and their parents/guardians will be required to sign an attendance notification. b) CCSD regulation R -5113 requires students under 18 to show proof of school attendance per NRS 483.2521. Students will be required to submit a DMV -301 to the DMV office for either an instruction permit or driver's license. c) Students who exceed 6 unverified absences in any class, per semest er, will not earn credit and may be referred to an alternative placement. Students referred to an alternative educational program will not gain credit from TVHS . d) If a student is absent due to physical or mental reasons, the parent/guardian must provide written notification to the school attendance office within three days of the absence. Failure to do this will result in an unexcused absence. e) A student who is determined to be habitually truant will be referred to the appropriate law enforcement officials and truancy court. f) Students more than 30 minutes late to class will be marked absent. 85 Regulation 5113. 2 Figure 3.3 : Student Schedule Sample Academic Plan 108 g) Notices will be sent to the student's recorded residence after the third, fifth, and eighth h) Absences for the following reasons will not be included in the absence total: a. while participating in a school -sanctioned activity, b. while on suspension or required parent conference, or c. while assigned in -house suspension. i) If the parent/legal guardian has reason to believe that there is an error in the attendance record, or if extenuating circumstances exist, an appeal hearing may be requested with the principal or designee. j) After any absence, a student shall be required to initiate contact with their teachers to obtain make -up work within three school days. Once contact has been made with teachers, the teachers will determine special make -up work and the time interval allowed for completion (3 -day minimum). Truancy Law School attendance is vital to academic success in school. Laws regarding school truancy include :86 a) The principal of the school is required to report the pupils who are habitually truant to law enforcement. b) A habitual truant is defined as \"a student who has three unapproved or unexcused absences within one year, for any class.\" c) A truant is a pupil who is absent from school without the written approval from a parent or guardian. d) The court the parent to pay a fine of $100 or more for habitual truancy. e) The court can order the suspension of existing driver's license privileges for students 16 years of age or older if they are habitual truants. This applies to students 14 years or older and it's not just existing license, it's holding up your original license. There needs to be a hearing first. NRS 392.148. Administrative sanctions against habitual truant after investigation and hearing; suspension or delay in issuance of driver's license; appeal by parent or guardian. (a) If it is the first time that administrative sanctions have been issued pursuant to this section because the pupil is a habitual truant, and the pupil is 14 years of age or older, order the suspension of the driver's license of the pupil for at least 30 days but not more than 6 months.

Describe the primary roles of the governing board and how it will interact with the principal/head of school and any advisory bodies. Explain how the board will evaluate the success of the school and school leader; and how the board will ensure that there will be active and effective representation of key stakeholders, including parents. The primary roles of the governing board will be to establish and uphold the principles and integrity of the school's mission and be prudent fiduciaries of funds , establi sh performance goals for the principal and metrics for determining when such goals are met, provide oversight and accountability of the principal. The Board will maintain a strong working relationship with the principal and key stakeholders such as student s, teachers and staff, parents, and the community. The Board establishes the mission, vision, and long -term strategy for the school, continually monitors and evaluates performance, but delegates day to day operations to key personnel hired. The Board will be responsible for hiring the principal, who will hire the school's faculty and staff. The school principal, selected by the Board, will be responsible for all aspects of school operations within the scope of operating policies, mission, vision, and fiduciary responsibilities as adopted and approved by the governing board. It is expected that the principal attends all board meetings to provide updates on the school's progress academically and other topics of interest for the Board. The school's faculty and staff will report directly to the principal, who will report to the Board. The principal will be formally evaluated by the School Board at least once per year, but there will be ongoing dialogue between the principal and the Board. The evaluation process will allow the administration an opportunity to set personal and professional goals in alignment with the charter and the school mission and vision, prior to the beginning of the school year. The Village High School plans to use the Evaluwise 87 online evaluation system. 2. Summarize the qualifications and experience of proposed members of the governing body of the school.

Building capacity means providing our Board with the capabilities, knowledge and resources needed to perform well, achieve results, and fulfill our mission. The current Board not only fulfills the statutory requirements but is composed of respected leaders in their areas of expertise. It is a priority to maintain this high -caliber, diverse Board while ensuring its members can devote the time necessary for its success. Indeed, we believe the Board benefits from the diverse backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives of others. That is why Board members will have term limits and elections will be held. Further, the Board will benefit by networki ng with other charter school boards through relevant state and national charter school conferences and keeping abreast of best practices updates. New members will be recruited and selected for their skills, which will round out the Board's capacity and kn owledge and further aid the school in fulfilling its mission and vision. Parents, educators, business and financial professionals and community stakeholders will be ideal candidates to contribute to the school's goals, growth, and objectives. To increase t he outcomes proposed in this application, TVHS will solicit involvement and participation of these groups. Should there be a vacancy on the Board, we will use the school's digital assets (e.g., internal social media and newsletter) to circulate the information as well as approach members of our stakeholder groups as potential Board candidates. During the recruitment process, potential Board candidates will be invited to learn about the mission, vision and philosophy of TVHS. Each potential candidate will be presented with the school's strategic plan and informed of the time commitment and legal and fiduciary responsibilities that are required for a position/role on the Board. Should there be a need, the Board may create a membership committee to facilitate r ecruitment. Operations Plan 113 8. Describe the kinds of orientation or training new board members will receive and what kinds of ongoing development existing board members will receive. The plan for training and development should include a timetable, specific topics to be addressed, and requirements for participation. Each Board member will have training to optimize their experience on the Board. We anticipate the training plan will include: Initial Orientation - The initial orientation is provided within thirty (30) days of a member joining the Board. The orientation is provided by at least two other Board members, key staff member(s) (i.e., Principal), a representative of the V illage S chools Organization (VSO) . A minimum of 8 hours of required (mandatory) training is provided which includes topics such as: Review of the bylaws and mission; Open meeting law requirements, Review of Charter Agreement; Job duties for Board members; Review and understanding of the school's education model; Analysis of financial considerations including reading a financial statement, audit and understanding of the budget; School tour and orientation on the school operations including meeting of key staff; and Review of the school management plan, school performance reports, attendance and other performance and outcome data. Ongoing Training/Development - The Board members have access to multiple opportunities for ongoing training. Four (4) hours of professional development annual training is required for all Board members and will be scheduled during evenings on a quarterly basis and/or through an annua l Board Retreat (scheduled by and for the Board), and/or the annual Education Summit (provided by the VSO). Training topics may include: Challenges of a first year school; Education and self- government; School achievement and performance; Financial reporti ng and performance; educational framework; Developing goals, objectives and strategic planning initiatives. Board members will attend at least one annual state charter school conference (usually in June and September) where they will receive professional g uidance and development on topics including governance and board leadership, financial oversight, budget, and academic accountability for schools. Board members will also be encouraged to join the Parent Teacher Organization (PTO) and attend meetings to sh ow school support and to collect feedback from important stakeholders and the community. The Board will also determine whether to utilize a third -party training organization such as the National Charter Schools Institute or Charter School Management Corpor ation (C SMC) to conduct training. 9. Describe the working relationship between the board and staff (academic, operations, and financial) and the working relationship between the board, staff, and any education management organization. Outline the regular r eports that will be provided to the board, their frequency, and who will provide them. This may include financial, operational, and/or or academic reports. TVHS Committee to Form includes a diverse group of professional and community leaders who have contributed funds and time to complete pre -approval activities such as research, marketing, formulation of academic plans, and all other aspects of the charter. Members of the Committee to Form will continue to support the school financially, tapping their personal and professional networks, participating in mentoring, and other relevant support activities. TVHS has no plans to contract with a third party CMO or E MO. Any contracts will be for specific professional services Operations Plan 114 such as financial reporting, payroll, etc., subject to board approved procurement policies and procedures. The school principal, selected by the Board, will be responsible for all aspects of sch ool operations within the scope of operating policies, procedures, and fiduciary responsibilities as adopted and approved by the governing board. It is expected that the principal regularly attends Board meetings to provide updates on the school's progress academically and other topics of interest for the Board.

Please include any existing competencies used for school leader selection and evaluation, if available (provide as Attachment 10). Provide, as Attachment 1 2, your leadership evaluation tool(s), as well as any supporting protocols or documentation. The principal will be evaluated by the Board at least once per year. The evaluation process will allow the administration an opportunity to set personal and professi onal goals in alignment with the charter and the school mission and vision, prior to the beginning of the school year. The Village High School plans to use the Evaluwise online evaluation system. Please see Attachments 10 and 12 4. Explain your school leader's role in the successful recruitment, hiring, development and retention of a highly effective staff. The principal is expected to establish a working environment that qualified faculty and staff want to be a part of. Indeed, the ideal environment will be positive, encouraging, and supportive. In terms of the mechanics of hiring, the principal will lead interviews of job candidates in conjunction with Operations Plan 117 other relevant staff members. The school will also provide a wide range of benefits such as: Health Insurance/Vision/Dental, PERS retirement contribution (half) , and benefits savings plans. 5. Explain your school leader's role in providing instructional guidance and school culture guidance. What role will other members of the leadership team play in providin g instructional guidance and school culture guidance?

Describe your strategy, plans, and timeline for recruiting and hiring teachers. Explain key selection criteria and any special considerations relevant to your school design. TVHS understands the importance of recruiting and hiring high quality teachers that are dedicated to the mission and vision of the school. To recruit high- quality teachers, TVHS will utilize social media , the school's website, Linkedin, job fairs, along with presentations at local colleges and universities. TVHS will be looking for candidates with the following qualifications: \u00b7 Bachelor's degree or higher \u00b7 Licensed by the state of Nevada in relevant content area. \u00b7 Mentoring \u00b7 Experience working with students who have experienced trauma. Attitude and Mindset: \u00b7 Humility (Humble) \u00b7 Sustainable commitment to doing a job well and going above and beyond (Hungry) \u00b7 The ability to understand and share the feelings of another (Empathy) \u00b7 Uncompromisingly student -centered \u00b7 Flexible \u00b7 Creative \u00b7 Growth oriented TVHS will attract and retain staff by developing and managing staff compensation, paid time off, and benefit packages which are competitive to area schools. We believe that teacher mentoring and training is one key to student achievement as well as teacher retention. Mentoring will be provided to teachers new to the profession, as well as new to the campus. Mentoring provides teachers new to the profession with practical information, guides teachers as they develop instructional skills, and offers feedback and opportunities for reflection. The teacher mentoring program will be inclusive of several areas; curriculum, project -based learning, student trauma training, student assessment, data disaggregation, classroom management, instructional strategies, communicating with parents, assisting students with special needs, and professional responsibilities such as maintaining gradebooks and required paperwork. Special to TVHS 's design, all staff will be regularly trained on project -based learning, how to mentor students, and how to teach students that have experienced trauma. These will be special sessions for teachers that can be utilized on Wellness Wednesday and on Professional Development Days. Operations Plan 120 2. Describe your plan to recruit and hire teachers/staff who are representative of your student body.

In a timely manner, after the candidate accepts, principal or designee will provide follow up communication with each applicant. 8. Begin on -boarding process. Fingerprinting/Criminal Background Checks In Nevada, fingerprint background checks are now required due to the passage of Senate Bill 287 in 2017.89 Specifically, the bill requires that those who are considered regular volunteers (those who visit four or more times per month) undergo these additional security measures. Ultimately enforcement is up to the p rincipal of the school. Addition ally, the law requires all those who volunteer to be fingerprinted if they have regular contact OR unsupervised contact with students. Fingerprinting is now required every five years for volunteers that meet this criterion. The law also mandates those volunteers who will have one -time unsupervised contact with students must go through the fingerprinting process. Finally, the law requires volunteers to act as mandatory reporters of child abuse and sign a document acknowledging that responsibility.90 Dismissing School Personnel 89 Nevada Legislature. SB287.

Explain how teachers will be supported and developed. Describe the school's performance management system and process for teacher evaluation. Provide your teacher evaluation tool(s) as Attachment 1 1, as well as any supporting protocols or documentation. The teachers will be evaluated once per year, based on three different observations. The evaluation process that we are proposing is the Charlotte Danielson Framework for Teaching.91 FFT is a comprehensive and coherent framework that identifies those aspects of a teacher's responsibilities that have been documented through empirical studies and theoretical research as promoting improved student learning. The FFT is an evolving instructional resource that provides a roadmap for effective teaching. It outlines 22 components and 76 elements organized into Four Domains of Teaching Responsibility: Planning & Preparation, Classroom Environment, Instruction, and Prof essional Responsibilities. Over time, the FFT has evolved to reflect new learning in the field and meet the needs of today's classrooms and students. The Danielson Group developed the Framework for Teaching Clusters (FFT Clusters) to reorganize the 22 comp onents of the FFT by drawing attention to the big ideas that support student learning. This tool anchors comprehensive approaches to teacher growth including coaching, professional learning communities, self - assessment and reflection, and other essential p ractices. The components of the FFT can support teachers to develop practices and approaches that meet the needs of their context. Given the shared elements of the current context during the 2020 -21 school year, TVHS has identified eight essential 91 The Danielson Group. (2021). Retrieved from ht tps://danielsongroup.org/framework Operations Plan 122 componen ts from the FFT and a pathway that prioritizes student wellbeing, equity, and racial justice. Without a deep understanding of students' identities and lives during these crises, TVHS has little chance of meeting their needs. 7. Please explain the responsibilities of each of your school's administrative/leadership team members with regard to Human Resources . Identify the staff member responsible for leading payroll, benefits, and employee relations and describe how key Human Resources responsibilities will be managed. Responsibilities Local Board School Leader Performance Goals The TVHS Board, along with school administration , sets annual goals that address the student performance goals.

Culture The Board will create and adopt policies to promote the culture that support s the mission and vision of TVHS. The school administration will be responsible for creating and maintaining a safe, positive school environment for all stakeholders. Budget and Accounting The Board will oversee all aspects of the fiscal management of the scho ol. The Board's Treasurer will be responsible for reviewing and approving School Financials. The Board The principal will oversee portions of the budget such as classroom supplies, copiers, travel, professional development, etc. The principal will review the school's budget with the Board monthly at the monthly Board meeting. Table 4.3: Leadership Team Responsibilities Operations Plan 123 will adopt a financial policies and procedures manual that is in line with financial best practices of charter schools across the country. Student Recruitment The Board will develop a start- up budget that includes marketing efforts and student recruitment. Administration will be responsible for hosting Open House meetings to help recruit students and be instrumental in organizing recruitment efforts during the startup yea rs and beyond. Social media and the website will also play an important role in student recruitment. Staff Recruitment /Hiring The Board will develop and review policies for hiring of personnel to support the school's mission and vision which are in compliance with state and federal law. The Board will interview and hire the principal . School administration will be responsible for interviewing (with a panel) and hiring all instructional and non- instructional staff. In addition, school ad ministration may attend teacher recruitment job fairs. HR Services (payroll, benefits, ect.) The Board will select a third party payroll company to contract with and provide the processing of payroll and benefits. School administration will serve as a HR resource to all staff. Administration will work with the legal team on the Board to ensure HR policies and procedures are followed correctly.

The Board has made the decision to work with Red Hook Capital Partners for the development. The principal will assist the Board with its development and fundraising efforts. 8. Explain how the school and organization intend to identify and address unsatisfactory leadership or teacher performance, as well as leadership/teacher changes and turnover. Teacher performance will be evaluated through several means. Performance is measured through individual goals, student success, and following policy, procedure, and laws. Where appropriate, employee performance and assessment will be a collaborative process between TVHS and the employee. However, unsatisfactory performance in any area may result in corrective action which can include verbal coaching, performance improvement plan (PIP) written warning, written reprimand, suspension with or w ithout pay, and/or termination In instances when it is necessary to conduct further investigation and the employee's continued presence in the work environment is deemed detrimental, the s chool may place the employee on suspension pending investigation for up to five (5) days with or without pay. An employee will be provided with notice and an opportunity to respond to performance concerns regarding the employee or charges being made against the employee. The school may conduct further investigation as warranted before making a final determination regarding the appropriate action to be taken. Notwithstanding any corrective action taken, the school may always exercise its right to terminate the employment relationship in accordance with applicable laws, emp loyee contracts (if any) and school policies. The cost of turnover is high at any school and can impact student achievement, productivity, and overall school culture. TVHS plans to implement appropriate reward and retention strategies to reduce overall tur nover of staff and impending cost. Turnover is calculated by including the number of days the position was open, recruiting costs, training costs, administrative processing, and payroll costs. 9. Will your organization require additional support (from third parties or consultants) for core Human Resources functions (e.g., payroll, benefits administration, employee relations, etc.)? If yes, please detail the areas that will require additional support and the costs and criteria for selecting such services. If not, please provide a detailed description of how these functions will be managed. The Board and TVHS will utilize support for its core Human Resources functions (services such as payroll, benefits administration, employee relations, etc.). The school may seek out specialized experts to assist with the complexities of the Affordable Care Act and Nevada Public Employees Retirement System, but these costs have been factored into the payroll budget. Operations Plan 125 STUDENT RECRUITMENT AND ENROLLMENT 1. Explain the plan for student recruitment and marketing that will provide equal access to interested students and families, including how the school will comply with the requirements of R 131 . Specifically, describe the plan for outreach to: families in poverty; academically low - achieving students; students with disabilities; and other youth at risk of academ ic failure. For schools which are giving one or more statutorily permissible admissions preferences pursuant to NRS 386.580 or SB390 (2015 session), please indicate if you plan to focus your student recruitment efforts in specific communities or selected a ttendance areas. (a) What is the enrollment calendar for both the first year of operation and subsequent years of operation? Please specify the dates on which the school will begin accepting applications and how long the enrollment window will last prior to conducting a lottery. Note that your proposed enrollment window should satisfy the requirements of NRS 388A.453(7). TVHS plans to begin operations in the 2022 -2023 school year. Open enrollment shall commence on January 1, 2022, beginning at 12:01 a.m. and continue through February 28, 2022, until 11:59p.m., and will occur during a similar time frame in subsequent years in compliance with NRS388A.453. A lottery will be held after the Open Enrollment period if the school receives more applications than there are seats available. If the limit is not reached during the Open Enrollment period, the enrollment window will remain open until the limit is reached. Once student enrollment is capped, names will be placed on a waiting list, in order, and students will be offered enrollment as seats become available. Families will be notified via email or phone of their child's acceptance into TVHS through the computerized lottery program. (b) What enrollment targets will you set and who will be responsible for monitoring progress towards these targets? What is your target re- enrollment rate for each year? How did you come to this determination? What are the minimum, planned, and maximum projected enrollment at each grade level? Outline specific targets in the table below. The school will implement an open enrollment policy, the school will be open to any student in the state that is eligible for attendance in a public school, unless the number of students enrolled exceeds the school capacity. In this case, students will be place d into a lottery and as seats open, students will be randomly selected to fill the open seats. If the number of applicants fall s short of capacity, the open enrollment window will remain open until capacity is reached. Admission will be determined in the following progression: 1. Students continuing enrollment at TVHS will automatically be granted enrollment the following year with placement determined by number of credits earned based on TVHS academic policies. 2. Siblings of currently enrolled TVHS stud ents will automatically be enroll ed into available openings in appropriate grade levels. Operations Plan 126 3. Students may also be enrolled based on the following preferences: Children of families of TVHS founding team. Children of Board members, teachers, or staff. All other children not meeting this criterion will be enrolled in the lottery. The enrollment target for the first year is 3 25 students. The governing body and the school's principal will be responsible for monitoring progress. The target re -enrollment rate is 95%. (c)What systems will you put in place to ensure that staff members are knowledgeable about all legal enrollment requirements pertaining to special populations and the servicing of particular populations of students? TVHS is committed to providing an equal o pportunity education to all applicants without regard to race, religion, color, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, national origin, citizenship status, age, disability, or any other protected status in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local laws that prohibit discrimination. Employees will receive training regarding the school's anti- discrimination, harassment, and retaliation policy as part of new hire on -boarding. In addition to having regular meetings to discuss the rules, TVHS will use applicable state -sponsored training/presentations for professional development. Daily and weekly monitoring of enrollment calls, and meetings will take place to ensure compliance. 2. Describe the student recruitment plan once your school has opened. In what ways will it be different than your pre -opening year, in terms of the strategies, activities, events, persons responsible and milestones? How will the school backfill vacancies in existing grades? TVHS will assess the community need and the mark eting tactics that reach the most families and will adjust ongoing recruitment and marketing efforts. TVHS understands that word of mouth, the website thevillagehs.org, and social media (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, TikTok) is the most successful way to inform families about the school. In addition, postcards and fliers will be sent to residents within a two -mile radius of the school to increase enrollment. The school will welcome school tours during the school year to show families what the school is like in action and will also host parent information meetings in the evening. The school will take advantage of any charter school fairs hosted by the Charter School Association of Nevada. The principal will be responsible for ensuring enrollment targets are m et. TVHS will use its waiting list to fill any vacancies that may occur by grade level. 3. Complete the following tables for the proposed school to open in 2022-23. Experienced Operators applying for multiple schools must complete enrollment summary tables fo r each school campus opening in fall 202 2.

Describe the rationale for the number of students and grade levels served in year one and the basis for the growth plan illustrated above. Start -up applicants proposing to open with more than 400 students or more than 3 grade levels should identify and discuss the specific elements of the school model detailed throughout the application that demonstrate that the proposed school is designed to compen sate for the known organizational and academic challenges which accompany serving larger student bodies and multiple grade levels in a start -up environment. The Committee to Form expects to see a high demand for this new high school model. The proposed school facility will be in North Las Vegas. The Committee to Form chose this location because it believes this is an area of our city that is in high need. The need is evidenced by the quality of schools in this area and the limited number of proficient test scores. 5. As Attachment 13, please provide evidence of demand from prospective students and families within the community you intend to serve. Please see Attachment 13 Table 4.5: Planned Enrollment Table 4.6: Maximum Enrollment Operations Plan 128 INCUBATION YEAR DEVELOPMENT 1. Provide a detailed start -up plan as well as specific organizational goals for the planning year (SY 202 1-202 2) to ensure that the school is ready for a successful launch in fall 202 2. Using the template provided, outline key activities, responsible parties, and milestones and submit as Attachment 1 4 (\"Incubation Year Planning Table\") . Please see Attachment 14 2. Please describe the plans for leadership training and development of the selected school leader during the incubation year prior to school opening and how these plans support your year 0 goal s. If partnering with an organization, please briefly describe the main components of the training program and why that organization was chosen. The general philosophical beliefs that guide this leadership training and development plan are that all this work shall be driven by TVHS's organizational beliefs, and the content must reflect the philosophy and culture of the school. The theoretical framework that guides the professional development is that leadership is developed by focusing on the Personal, Interpersonal, Managerial, and Organizational attributes, skills, and competencies of TVHS's leadership team. The theory of a ction is that, i f TVHS, supported by board and external partners, provides high quality, in depth, current and innovative employee and leadership capacity -building in a thoughtful and well -planned structure, key performance indicators will rise and allow TVHS to accomplish its long- term strategic vision and plan. The elements of this focus will be a) Character and Culture; b) Organizational Management; c) Coaching and Mentoring; d) Decision Making, and e) Instructional Leadership . 92 Upon the initial hiring of the leadership team , two days of professional development will be provided to ensure that there is alignment between the beliefs, goals, and culture of TVHS and the leadership behaviors of the new team. The Board will be included in this as well. An additional day will be provided to ensure that the leadership team understands Nevada charter law, regulation, statutes, and expectations as well as understanding the collection and reporting of all pertinent data. The board of directors, along with the leadership team, will receive two days of training in governance, Nevada Open Meeting Law, and conflict of interest. There will also be time set aside for the development of a governance team handbook which makes explicit the roles, responsibilities, and the protocols needed for interaction between the board of directors and the leadership team. Upon the hiring of teaching staff, the priority will be team building, including the school culture and beliefs. Classroom level scope and sequence instruction, lesson plans, special education processes, school protocols, procedures and requirements will follow as well as training in the use of specific software. Additionally, teaching staff will need training in the Summit Learning protocols and an understanding of Social Emotional Learning. These will begin with overviews and continuous 92 Gallizzi, R. (2021). Every Student Learns, Inc., Theoretical Framework. Operations Plan 129 training will be e mbedded throughout the school year as part of the professional development set aside on Wellness Wednesdays. Teachers will be supported by ongoing observation, feedback, and coachin g. The professional development for the leadership and board will be provided by Every Student Learns (ESL), a Nevada based organization. This organization was chosen because of a shared underpinning philosophy that every student has an innate ability a nd desire to learn give n the right conditions. ESL looks for innovative ways to enhance and improve learning environment s to optimize the educational opportunities for all involved. They have a proven track record of working with traditional public schoo ls, school boards, charter schools, and charter school boards. SEED Impact Learning will provide the initial and ongoing training in SEL . They have been in existence for over twenty years and provide support to the nonprofit sector. Summit Learning wil l provide the initial and ongoing training on project -based learning, how to foster life -long learning habits, and the art and science of mentoring students. Summit Learning is a research-based approach to education designed to drive student engagement, meaningful learning, and strong student -teacher relationships that prepare students for life beyond the classroom. They currently support over 400 schools across the US. All three of these providers will be present throughout the years through observation of staff and follow -up feedback and coaching as well as the embedded professional development. 3.

SERVICES (1) Provide a description of how the school leadership team will support operational execution. Please provide narrative or evidence that illustrates the staffing model, performance metrics, and the school's plan for supporting all operational needs of the sch ool, including but not limited to those listed below. In this space and in the finances section, demonstrate how you will fund the provision of these services. (a) Transportation: Describe your plans for providing student transportation. If the school will not provide transportation, please identify how the school will ensure that this does serve as a barrier to enrollment or ongoing attendance. TVHS will not provide daily transportation for the students to and from school. Should a special education student enroll who has an Individ ualized Educational Plan (IEP) that has transportation as an accommodation, TVHS will work to partner with CCSD or Regio nal Transportation Commission of Southern Nevada ( RTC ) as to how to best provide this accommodation. For any school field trips or events, a plan will be developed to accommodate transportation needs by contracting a charter bus company. The school will wo rk with their broker at Charter School Insurance Alliance to ensure that all necessary insurance policies and coverage are in place. Operations Plan 130 (b) Food Service: Outline your plans for providing food service at the school, including whether and how you will be your own school food authority or will contract with another provider. If the school will not provide food service, please identify how the school will ensure that this does serve as a barrier to enrollment or ongoing attendance. TVHS plans on providing food se rvices at their school and anticipates participating in the National School Lunch Program. TVHS also anticipates identifying and contracting with a third -party service provider. The Board will ensure that the vendor is approved and is in good standing with the Food and Nutrition Program. (c) Facilities maintenance (including janitorial and landscape maintenance) TVHS plans to have a campus monitor(s) and custodian(s).

TVHS will be a provider of health services to all students identified in need of those services. The governing body will contract with the appropriate trained professionals, the number of professionals will be based on the student enrollment and number of students enrolled requiring care and services. In accordance with NRS 392.420, a licensed school nurse will be contracted by TVHS to train the health office staff. A First Aid Safety Assist ant (FASA) will be responsible for planning and carrying out health examinations required by law, and for checking immunizations. The FASA will be responsible for following up with parents/guardians of any student who has a problem in any of the screenings or students missing immunizations. Pursuant to NRS 392.420, the FASA will also repost these findings to the State Health Officer . (e) Purchasing processes The purchasing agent will be appointed by the governing body (traditionally the s chool principal). They will be responsible for developing and administering the charter school's purchasing program. No obligation may be incurred by any officer or employee of the governing body unless that expenditure has been authorized in the budget or by gov erning body action and/or governing body policy. In all cases calling for the expenditure of charter school money, except payrolls, a requisition and purchase order system must be used. Unless authorized by the administrator, no purchase, except for a pett y cash purchase, will be authorized unless covered by an approved purchase order . No bills will be approved for payment unless purchases were made on approved orders. T he administrator or designee is authorized to enter and approve payment on contracts obl igating charter school funds not to exceed ($25,000) for products, materials, supplies, capital outlay and services that are within current budget appropriations. The governing body shall approve all contracts that are collective bargaining Operations Plan 131 agreements or s ervice contracts that include the provision of labor performed by charter school employees, such as custodial, food service and transportation services. The administrator will review bills due and payable for the purch ase of supplies and services to determ ine if they are within budget amounts. After appropriate administrative review, the administrator will direct payment of the just claims against the chart er school. The administrator is responsible for the accuracy of all bills and vouchers. Bids or propos als shall be called for on all purchase, lease or sale of personal property, public improvements, or services other than agreements for personal service, in accordance with applicable competitive p rocurement provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes and adopted public contracting rules.93 (f) Safety and security (include any plans for onsite security personnel) Emergency Management Plan Campus monitor(s), security cameras, ID badges for all students and staff. Monthly drills All visitors must check in with the main office Staff training on emergency protocols (2) Technology: Outline the technology infrastructure and support mechanisms across your school, staff, and teachers. Your outline should include but not be limited to reliable and secure wide area networking, local area networking (e.g., wireless and cables), hardware (e.g., personal computing devices, servers, telephony, storage, routers, switches), technology policies and procedures, device management, and end user support. TVHS 's IT plan is premised around the idea that it supports the m ission and v ision o f the school. Technology will be part of school culture and because it is such an important part to this schools overall plan it will be crucial that all educators have a voice in the ongoing process of building out the structure. TVHS will primarily use a wireless system with a goal of providing a seamless one to one implementation for all staff and students. Ongoing assessment of the system will be built into the school technology plan. Ease of integration and technology as a tool to support the curriculu m is of highest importance. Technology will be a tool that will be designed to work seamlessly and personally for every individual. Technology should never be a barrier to learning. To support daily operations TVHS will employ a technology firm (two have b een sourced) to provide technology hardware and software support. Ongoing PD will be necessary and provided to ensure that staff are prepared to use the tools effectively and efficiently. Specific software tools and the Learning Management System (LMS) systems, Infinite Campus and Google Classroom will have a technology team designed, pathway of incremental stepped PD education for staff. The technology team will consist of TVHS staff with the expertise and experience to lead their colleagues in valuable PD to improve instruction. If necessary, TVHS will contract with outside consultants to deliver high quality PD to the staff. Specific online software tools that are part of the educational program such as the SEED Impact and Summit Learning programs have PD components included as part of the initial program rollout. 93 NRS Chapter 332, 388A.420 Operations Plan 132 TVHS will use a router, filtering and firewall security system that will keep students safe even when they use laptops on/off school premises. The software components will include software to bl ock, monitor and eliminate any suspicious or malicious intrusions via intranet. Students along with staff will develop and agree to an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) to set the standard and expectations for the use of all technology. Students will also be held to an expectation of full compliance and will sign -off on the AUP. The goal of the IT infrastructure and complete technology system is immediate safe secured filtered access for all stakeholders with every aspect of the implementation centered on the learner and providing a reliable enterprise built on digital equity. TVHS will pursue e -rate pricing and support from this this will provide between 70% -90% of the schools initial and ongoing technology related expenses. All infrastructure components to su pport the visible end of technology must be robust at TVHS , as it is a high -tech school. Internet b andwidth will be provided by COX Communications w hich has given a pricing of $1000 a month for necessary bandwidth with room for growth within that quote and to include phone services. All other necessary hardware: secure router, server, UPS, switches, WIFI nodes, hardwire cabling , etc. , will be sourced and installed using a reputable provider. Our provider will also plan for disaster recovery and will keep mu ltiple backups using an automated off -site cloud -based system. Login credentials will be created and maintained offsite with a staff person designated to add or delete students as needed. Virus and other threat protections will be in place with a plan developed for disaster recovery. The initial infrastructure will be robust and scalable for school growth. It will include security and cloud -based services. The actual physical on -site support hardware will be in a secured limited access location. Google will provide the primary e -mail, digital cloud drive with office products, and Google classroom as the primary Learning Management System. It is cost -effective, (free to public education), scalable, supports a wide variety of formats and teaching modalities. It is available to the students and parents 24/7 anywhere the internet is available. Because it is supported by Google all data has redundancy, and it is hardware independent. It is available on laptop, PC, tablet, and phone. The use of Google products wil l help to ensure the minimizing of any malicious malware and viruses. The school will use Infinite Campus as its Student Information System ( SIS) using it to maintain student records, grades, attendance, finance, and human resources. This is an on-line system that has training components included in the startup pricing included in the budget. Additional software i.e., Adobe S uite , will be added as needed to support the needs of the staff and school. TVHS will review and comply with all NRS 385A.800 laws. Student laptops as well as all TVHS hardware will have physical external asset itemized labeling. All laptops will have tracking and locating software pre -installed, and laptops will be heavily branded with TVHS name and l ogo. Students will be given responsibility and be expected to maintain hardware in good physical condition. The school will design methods and systems to maintain hardware and to replace broken or irretrievable hardware. To monitor and review all technology needs and to further develop tec hnology the building principal will appoint a technology committee to have meetings and develop a five- year technology plan. They will also monitor, develop, and conduct yearly surveys of students, staff, and parents for technology services performance and needs. This will include implementation and ongoing school modifications as recommended by the committee. Other aspects of technology i.e., CCTV system will also be considered by the committee with all recommendations and plans taken to the Committee to Form and later to the School Board. Operations Plan 133 (3) Student Information Management: Timely communication of accurate student information is critical for payments to schools, compliance, and performance monitoring. Please describe how you will manage studen t information using the statewide Infinite Campus system, and how you will build capacity around the use of the software. If most of the applicant group or the CMO/ EMO is new to operating in Nevada's education environment, explain your plan to determine N evada specific reporting requirements. Detail the staff members who will enter data along with the project manager who will commit to trainings and regularly monitor student information for accuracy. TVHS will be using the statewide Infinite Campus system and will also be hiring a Registration/Attendance Clerk to fulfil all required duties. Infinite Campus representatives will provide specific Registrar/Attendance training along with staff training specifically on Infinite Campus. Registrar/Attendance staff will attend any training hosted by the SPCSA. (4) Data Security: SPCSA charter schools record, generate and consume data that falls under strict requirements for security, privacy, and retention (including FERPA and recent legislation related to the protectio n of personally identifiable information (PII)). Describe the systems and procedures you will implement in order to ensure you are compliant with these obligations. The governing board will delegate authority to the principal the task of ensuring student records are maintained accurately and up -to-date as well as safe and with limited access to only appropriate personnel. The Board will ensure student records will be accurately maintained and kept in a safe, locked area of the school's main office in secure cabinets, and in accordance with all Nevada laws. Only authorized staff and administration will have access to the files. In accordance with NRS 385A.800 -8.30, the school will participate in Student Accountability Informati on Network ( SAIN ) and will use software, hardware, and telecommunications compatible with its sponsor (The Nevada State Board of Education) to fulfill data transfer requirements to the sponsor. T VHS will report data to its sponsor by the beginning of the s chool's first year of operation. T VHS will use Infinite Campus that is hosted as an Application Service Provider by the Department of Education. The governing board chairperson will be the person responsible for the records of students if the school is dissolved or the written charter of the charter school is not renewed. If the charter school closes, or a student withdraws , the school will forward the permanent record of the student to the office of student records of the school district in which the stud ent resides. When a student graduates from the charter school, the school shall forward the permanent record of the pupil(s) to the office of student records of the school district in which the pupil resides. If a licensed teacher who is a member of the go verning body of a charter school fails to comply with the policy, the charter authorizer may consider whether such failure to comply constitutes grounds for suspension or revocation of the license of the teacher pursuant to NRS 391.330 and whether appropriate action is warranted in accordance with NRS 391.320 to 391.361, inclusive. In accordance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) (20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232g; 34 CFR Part 99), parents or eligible students have the right to inspect and review t he student's education records maintained by the school. Schools are not required to provide copies of records unless it is impossible for parents or eligible students to review the records. Schools may charge a fee for copies. Parents or eligible students have the right to request that a school correct records, which they believe to be inaccurate or misleading. Schools may disclose, without consent, Operations Plan 134 \"directory\" information. Schools must notify parents and eligible students annually of their rights under FE RPA. In addition, TVHS will comply with NRS 388.291 to ensure that all school service providers provide written disclosure of the types of personally identifiable information collected by the school service and the plan for ensuring data security. Strict compliance with this statute will be enforced by the Board Chair and the principal prior to purchasing any school service. Additionally, pursuant to NRS 388.294, the principal will ensure that all teachers and other licensed educational personnel complete professional development regarding the use of school service providers and the security of data concerning pupils.

The purpose of this Board conflict of interest policy (this \"Policy \") is to protect The Village High School (\"TVHS\")'s integrity, interests, and reputation when it is contemplating entering into a transaction or arrangement that might benefit the private interests of a director, board officer, or board committee (or subcommittee) member of TVHS (any such person, a \" TVHS Governor \"). 2. This policy is intended to supple ment, but not replace, any applicable state and federal laws and regulations governing conflicts of interest applicable to charter schools, as well as TVHS's Charter Agreement and Rules of Governance, as they may be amended from time to time. (In the event of an unavoidable conflict, those laws, regulations, and documents trump this Policy.) 3. Among other things, the applicable laws include the Nevada Code of Ethical Standards (the \"Nevada Ethical Code \"), codified at NRS 281A.400 et seq., a copy of which (in effect as of the start of the 2022 -2023 school year) is attached as Exhibit A to this Policy, and which applies to each TVHS Governor (as a \"Public Officer \") pursuant to NAC 386.345(7). ARTICLE II: DEFINITIONS 1. Interested TVHS Governor . Any TVHS Governor w ho has a direct or indirect financial interest, as defined below, is an \" Interested TVHS Governor .\" 2. Financial interest . A person has a relevant \" financial interest \" if the person has, directly or indirectly, through business, investment, or family: a. An o wnership or investment interest in any entity with which TVHS has a transaction or arrangement, b. A compensation arrangement with any entity or individual with which TVHS has a transaction or arrangement, c. A potential ownership or investment interest in, or compensation arrangement with, any entity or individual with which TVHS is negotiating (or is reasonably likely to negotiate in the next six months) a transaction or arrangement; or d. One of other types of interests listed in NRS 281A.420(1)(a) through (d) o f the Nevada Ethical Code. Attachment 6 Board Bylaws, Code of Ethics, and Conflict of Interest Policies 310 Compensation includes direct and indirect remuneration as well as gifts or favors that are not insubstantial. A financial interest is not necessarily a conflict of interest. A person who has a financial interest may have a co nflict of interest only if the TVHS Governor or Board decides that a conflict of interest exists, in accordance with this Policy. 3. Independent Director . A director shall be considered \" independent \" for the purposes of this Policy if he or she is not an I nterested TVHS Governor. ARTICLE III: POLICY MATTERS 1. General Prohibitions . a. Every TVHS Governor shall comply in all material respects with the provisions of NRS 281A.400 of the Nevada Ethical Code, which (paraphrasing, and without amending that statute, nor exhaustively summarizing it) generally prohibits the TVHS Governors from: b. accepting gifts which will improperly influence decision making, or using his or her position to gain unjustified privileges or benefits; c. participating in negotiations with an entity in which the TVHS Governor has a significant pecuniary interest; d. receiving compensation from a private source for the TVHS Governor's public duties; e. using confidentially -obtained information for his or her own pecuniary gain, or suppressing official information to prevent a loss in his or her own pecuniary interests; and f. using TVHS time, property, equipment, or facilities for his or her own pecuniary gain. 2. Duty to Disclose . f. In connection with any actual or possible conflict of interest, an Interested TVHS Governor must timely disclose the existence of the financial interest and be given a reasonable opportunity to disclose all of the material facts to the Board, in accordance with the full paragraph in NRS 281A.420(1) of the Nevada Ethical C ode (but subject to the disclosure exceptions in NRS 281A.420(1) of that Code). g. For Open Meeting Law purposes, a conflict -of-interest discussion is deemed to be a part of any agenda item in which an actual or potential conflict of interest is raised, even if the conflict -of-interest is not expressly stated in the agenda item and is only raised at the meeting. 3. Recusal (a/k/a abstention) by Oneself . h. A director shall recuse himself or herself at any time from involvement in any decision or advocacy (but not necessarily the discussion, generally) in which the director believes he or she has or may have a conflict of interest, when recusal is required by NRS 281A.420(3) and (4)(a) of the Nevada Ethical Code. Generally, the test in those statutes is whether the Attachment 6 Board Bylaws, Code of Ethics, and Conflict of Interest Policies 311 \"independence of judgment of a reasonable person in the public officer's situation would be materially affected\" by the financial interest. That is an objective test, based on what a reasonable person would do. Any director may recuse himself or herself at any time from involvement in any decision or discussion in which the director believes he or she has or may have a conflict of interest, without going through any process for the other TVHS Governors determining whether a conflict of interest exists, but shall first consider the policy statement set forth in NRS281A.420(4)(b) of the Nevada Ethical Code, which discourages abstention except in \"clear cases.\" i. Upon recusal, the necessary quorum to act upon the matter, and the number of votes necessary t o act upon the matter, as fixed by any statute, ordinance or rule, is reduced as though the member abstaining were not a member of the Board, Committee, or Subcommittee. In the event of a tie vote among the remaining TVHS Governors, no approval or denial s hall be deemed given (meaning it is as if the Board did not vote). 4. Recusal by the Remaining TVHS Governors . If, after disclosure of the financial interest and all material facts pursuant to Section III(1), and after any discussion with the Interested TVHS Governor, the Interested TVHS Governor has not recused himself or herself, and an Independent TVHS Governor (on the Board, Committee, or Subcommittee, as the case may be) has reasonable concerns about that decision, then: the Interested TVHS Govern or shall leave the Board meeting; and the remaining Independent TVHS Governors shall discuss, decide if a conflict of interest exists, and vote upon recusal. 5. Eligibility for Contracts . Neither TVHS nor any TVHS Governor (nor any entity controlled by a TVHS Governor) shall bid upon, negotiate, or enter into any contract or similar arrangement except in material accordance with NRS 281A.430 of the Nevada Ethical Code, describing in detai l under which conditions such contracts or arrangements may and may not be bid upon, negotiated, and entered into. 6. Additional Matters . The Board President, if appropriate, appoint an Independent TVHS Governor or committee to investigate alternatives to a proposed transaction or arrangement. If the Interested TVHS Governor is the Board President, then a majority of the Governance Committee may take these actions. 7. Violations of the Conflicts of Interest Policy . Attachment 6 Board Bylaws, Code of Ethics, and Conflict of Interest Policies 312 j. If the Board has reasonable cause to believe a TVHS Governor has failed to disclose actual or possible conflicts of interest, it shall inform the TVHS Governor of the basis for such belief and afford the TVHS Governor an opportunity to explain the alleged failure to disclose. k. If, after hearing the TVHS Governor's response and after making further investigation as warranted by the circumstances, the Board determines that the TVHS Governor has failed to disclose an actual or possible conflict of interest (with a vote of a simple majority of Independent TVHS Governors, excluding the board member in question), it shall take appropriate disciplinary and corrective action. 8. Amendments to this Policy . A majority of the Board as a whole may approve or disapprove of amendments and modifications to this Policy from time to time. Upon any modification being approved, the school shall submit the same to the State Public Charter Schools Au thority (\"SPCSA\") within five (5) days. ARTICLE IV: RECORDS OF PROCEEDINGS The minutes of the Board, committee, and subcommittee shall contain: 1. The names of the persons who disclosed or otherwise were found to have a financial interest in connection with an actual or possible conflict of interest, the nature of the financial interest, any action taken to determine whether a conflict of interest was present, and the Interested TVHS Governor or Board's decision as to whether recusal was required. 2. The names of the persons who were present for discussions and votes relating to the relevant transaction or arrangement, the content of the discussion, including any alternatives to the proposed transaction or arrangement, and a record of any votes taken in connectio n with the proceedings. ARTICLE V: ANNUAL STATEMENTS 1. Each TVHS Governor shall annually sign a statement which affirms that such person: a. Has received a copy of this Policy, b. Has read and understands this Policy, and c. Has agreed to comply with this Policy. 2. If at any time during the year, the information in the annual statement changes materially, the Interested TVHS Governor shall immediately disclose such changes and revise the annual disclosure form. 3. The Governance Committee shall regularly and c onsistently monitor and enforce compliance with this Policy by reviewing annual statements and taking such other actions as are necessary for effective oversight.

A code of ethical standards is hereby established to govern the conduct of public officers and employees: 1. A public officer or employee shall not seek or accept any gift, service, favor, employment, engagement, emolument or economic opportunity, for the public officer or employee or any person to whom the public officer or employee has a commitment in a private capacity, which would tend improperly to influence a reasonable person in the public officer's or employee's position to depart from the faithful and impartial discharge of the public officer's or employee's public duties. 2. A public officer or employee shall not use the public offic er's or employee's position in government to secure or grant unwarranted privileges, preferences, exemptions or advantages for the public officer or employee, any business entity in which the public officer or employee has a significant pecuniary interest or any person to whom the public officer or employee has a commitment in a private capacity. As used in this subsection, \"unwarranted\" means without justification or adequate reason. 3. A public officer or employee shall not participate as an agent of governm ent in the negotiation or execution of a contract between the government and the public officer or employee, any business entity in which the public officer or employee has a significant pecuniary interest or any person to whom the public officer or employ ee has a commitment in a private capacity. 4. A public officer or employee shall not accept any salary, retainer, augmentation, expense allowance or other compensation from any private source, for the public officer or employee or any person to whom the publi c officer or employee has a commitment in a private capacity, for the performance of the public officer's or employee's duties as a public officer or employee. 5. If a public officer or employee acquires, through the public officer's or employee's public duti es or relationships, any information which by law or practice is not at the time available to people generally, the public officer or employee shall not use the information to further a significant pecuniary interest of the public officer or employee or an y other person or business entity. 6. A public officer or employee shall not suppress any governmental report or other official document because it might tend to affect unfavorably a significant pecuniary interest of the public officer or employee or any pers on to whom the public officer or employee has a commitment in a private capacity. 7. Except for State Legislators who are subject to the restrictions set forth in subsection 8, a public officer or employee shall not use governmental time, property, equipment or other Attachment 6 Board Bylaws, Code of Ethics, and Conflict of Interest Policies 314 facility to benefit a significant personal or pecuniary interest of the public officer or employee or any person to whom the public officer or employee has a commitment in a private capacity. This subsection does not prohibit: a) A limited use of gov ernmental property, equipment or other facility for personal purposes if: 1. The public officer or employee who is responsible for and has authority to authorize the use of such property, equipment or other facility has established a policy allowing the use o r the use is necessary as a result of emergency circumstances; 2. The use does not interfere with the performance of the public officer's or employee's public duties; 3. The cost or value related to the use is nominal; and 4.

If a governmental agency incurs a cost as a result of a use that is authorized pursuant to this subsection or would ordinarily charge a member of the general public for the use, the public officer or employee shall promptly reimburse the cost or pay the charge to the governmental agency. 8. [Intentionally omitted] 9. A public officer or employee shall not attempt to benefit a significant personal or pecuniary interest of the public officer or employee or any person to whom the public officer or employee has a commitment in a private capacity through the influence of a subordinate. 10. A public officer or employee shall not seek other employment or contracts for the public officer or employee or any person to whom the public officer or employee has a commitment in a private capacity through the use of the public officer's or employee's official position. NRS 281A.410 Limitations on representing or counseling private persons before public agencies; request for relief from strict application of certain provisions. In addition to the requirements of the code of ethical standards and the other provisions of this chapter: 1. If a public officer or employee serves in a state agency of the Executive Department or an agency of any county, city or other political subdivision, the public officer or employee: Attachment 6 Board Bylaws, Code of Ethics, and Conflict of Interest Policies 315 a) Shall not accept compensation from any priva te person to represent or counsel the private person on any issue pending before the agency in which that public officer or employee serves, if the agency makes decisions; and b) If the public officer or employee leaves the service of the agency, shall not, for 1 year after leaving the service of the agency, represent or counsel for compensation a private person upon any issue which was under consideration by the agency during the public officer's or employee's service. As used in this paragraph, \"issue\" inclu des a case, proceeding, application, contract or determination, but does not include the proposal or consideration of legislative measures or administrative regulations 2. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 3, a State Legislator or a member of a local legislative body, or a public officer or employee whose public service requires less than half of his or her time, may represent or counsel a private person before an agency in which he or she does not serve. 3. A member of a local legislative body shall not represent or counsel a private person for compensation before another local agency if the territorial jurisdiction of the other local agency includes any part of the county in which the member serves. The Commission may relieve the member from the strict application of the provisions of this subsection if: a) The member files a request for an advisory opinion from the Commission pursuant to NRS 281A.675; and b) The Commission determines that such relief is not contrary to: i. The best interests of the public; ii. The continued ethical integrity of each local agency affected by the matter; and iii. The provisions of this chapter. 4. For the purposes of subsection 3, the request for an advisory opinion, the advisory opinion and all meetings, hearings and proceedings of the Commi ssion in such a matter are governed by the provisions of NRS 281A.670 to 281A.690, inclusive. 5. Unless permitted by this section, a public officer or employee shall not represent or counsel a private person for compensation before any state agency of the Executive or Legislative Department. NRS 281A.420 Requirements regarding disclosure of conflicts of interest and abstention from voting because of certain types of conflicts; effect of abstention on quorum and voting requirements; exceptions. 1. Except as otherw ise provided in this section, a public officer or employee shall not approve, disapprove, vote, abstain from voting or otherwise act upon a matter: a) Regarding which the public officer or employee has accepted a gift or loan; b) In which the public officer or e mployee has a significant pecuniary interest; Attachment 6 Board Bylaws, Code of Ethics, and Conflict of Interest Policies 316 c) Which would reasonably be affected by the public officer's or employee's commitment in a private capacity to the interests of another person; or d) Which would reasonably be related to the nature of any representation or counseling that the public officer or employee provided to a private person for compensation before another agency within the immediately preceding year, provided such representation or counseling is permitted by NRS 281A.410, without disclosing information concerning the gift or loan, the significant pecuniary interest, the commitment in a private capacity to the interests of the other person or the nature of the representation or counseling of the private person that is sufficient to inform the public of the potential effect of the action or abstention upon the person who provided the gift or loan, upon the public officer's or employee's significant pecuniary interest, upon the person to whom the public officer or employee has a commitment in a private capacity or upon the private person who was represented or counseled by the public officer or employee. Such a disclosure must be made at the time the matter is considered. If the public officer or employee is a member of a body which makes decisions, the public officer or employee shall make the disclosure in public to the chair and other members of the body. If the public officer or employee is not a member of such a body and holds an a ppointive office, the public officer or employee shall make the disclosure to the supervisory head of the public officer's or employee's organization or, if the public officer holds an elective office, to the general public in the area from which the publi c officer is elected. 2. The provisions of subsection 1 do not require a public officer to disclose: a) Any campaign contributions that the public officer reported in a timely manner pursuant to NRS 294A.120 or 294A.125; or b) Any contributions to a legal defense fund that the public officer reported in a timely manner pursuant to NRS 294A.286. 3. Except as otherwise provided in this section, in addition to the requirements of subsection 1, a public officer shall not vote upon or advocate the passage or failure of, but may otherwise participate in the consideration of, a matter with respect to which the independence of judgment of a reasonable person in the public officer's situation would be materially affected by: a) The public officer's acceptance of a gift or loan; b) The public officer's significant pecuniary interest; or c) The public officer's commitment in a private capacity to the interests of another person. 4. In interpreting and applying the provisions of subsection 3: a) It must be presumed that the independence of judgment of a reasonable person in the public officer's situation would not be materially affected by the public officer's acceptance of a gift or loan, significant pecuniary interest or commitment in a private capacity to the interests of another person where th e resulting benefit or detriment accruing to the public officer, or if the public officer has a commitment in a private capacity to the interests of Attachment 6 Board Bylaws, Code of Ethics, and Conflict of Interest Policies 317 another person, accruing to the other person, is not greater than that accruing to any other member of any general business, profession, occupation or group that is affected by the matter. The presumption set forth in this paragraph does not affect the applicability of the requirements set forth in subsection 1 relating to the duty of the public officer to make a proper disclosure at the time the matter is considered and in the manner required by subsection 1. b) The Commission must give appropriate weight and proper deference to the public policy of this State which favors the right of a public officer to perform the duties for which the public officer was elected or appointed and to vote or otherwise act upon a matter, provided the public officer makes a proper disclosure at the time the matter is considered and in the manner required by subsection 1. Because abst ention by a public officer disrupts the normal course of representative government and deprives the public and the public officer's constituents of a voice in governmental affairs, the provisions of this section are intended to require abstention only in c lear cases where the independence of judgment of a reasonable person in the public officer's situation would be materially affected by the public officer's acceptance of a gift or loan, significant pecuniary interest or commitment in a private capacity to the interests of another person. 5. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 241.0355, if a public officer declares to the body or committee in which the vote is to be taken that the public officer will abstain from voting because of the requirements of this section, the necessary quorum to act upon and the number of votes necessary to act upon the matter, as fixed by any statute, ordinance or rule, is reduced as though the member abstaining were not a member of the body or committee. 6.

A member of any board, commission or simil ar body who is engaged in the profession, occupation or business regulated by such board, commission or body may, in the ordinary course of his or her business, bid on or enter into a contract with an agency, except the board, commission or body on which h e or she is a member, if the member has not taken part in developing the contract plans or specifications and the member will not be personally involved in opening, considering or accepting offers. 3.

A member of a local legislative body shall not, either individually or through any b usiness entity in which the member has a significant pecuniary interest, sell goods or services to the local agency governed by his or her local legislative body unless: a) The member, or the business entity in which the member has a significant pecuniary interest, offers the sole source of supply of the goods or services within the territorial jurisdiction of the local agency governed by his or her local legislative body; b) The local legislative body includes in the public notice and agenda for the meeting at w hich it will consider the purchase of such goods or services a clear and conspicuous statement that it is considering purchasing such goods or services from one of its members, or from a business entity in which the member has a significant pecuniary inter est; c) At the meeting, the member discloses his or her significant pecuniary interest in the purchase of such goods or services and does not vote upon or advocate the approval of the matter pursuant to the requirements of NRS 281A.420; and d) The local legislative body approves the purchase of such goods or services in accordance with all other applicable provisions of law. 6. The Commission may relieve a public officer or employee from the strict application of the provisions of this section if: a) The public officer or employee files a request for an advisory opinion from the Commission pursuant to NRS 281A.675; and b) The Commission determines that such relief is not contrary to: i. The best interests of the public; ii. The continued ethical integrity of each agency affected by the matter; and iii. The provisions of this chapter.

For the purposes of subsection 6, the request for an advisory opinion, the advisory opinion and all meetings, hearings and proceedings of the Commission in such a matter are governed by the provisions of NRS 281A.670 to 281A.690, inclusive.

Except as otherwise provided in this section, a public officer or employee shall not approve, disapprove, vote, abstain from voting or otherwise act upon a matter: (a) Regarding which the public officer or employee has accepted a gift or loan; (b) In which the public officer or employee has a significant pecuniary interest; Attachment 6 Board Bylaws, Code of Ethics, and Conflict of Interest Policies 325 (c) Which would reasonably be affected by the public officer's or employee's commitment in a private capacity to the interests of another person; or (d) Which would reasonably be related to the nature of any representation or counseling that the public officer or employee provided to a private person for compensation before another agency within the immediately preceding year, provided such representation or counseling is permitted by NRS 281A.410, without disclosing information concerning the gift or loan, the significant pecuniary interest, the commitment in a private capacity to the interests of the other person or the nature of the representation or counseling of the private person that is sufficient to inform the public of the potential effect of the action or abstention upon the person who provided the gift or loan, upon the public officer's or employee' s significant pecuniary interest, upon the person to whom the public officer or employee has a commitment in a private capacity or upon the private person who was represented or counseled by the public officer or employee. Such a disclosure must be made at the time the matter is considered. If the public officer or employee is a member of a body which makes decisions, the public officer or employee shall make the disclosure in public to the chair and other members of the body. If the public officer or emplo yee is not a member of such a body and holds an appointive office, the public officer or employee shall make the disclosure to the supervisory head of the public officer's or employee's organization or, if the public officer holds an elective office, to the general public in the area from which the public officer is elected. 2. The provisions of subsection 1 do not require a public officer to disclose: (a) Any campaign contributions that the public officer reported in a timely manner pursuant to NRS 294A.120 or 294A.125; or (b) Any contributions to a legal defense fund that the public officer reported in a timely manner pursuant to NRS 294A.286. 3. Except as otherwise provided in this section, in addition to the requirements of subsection 1, a public off icer shall not vote upon or advocate the passage or failure of, but may otherwise participate in the consideration of, a matter with respect to which the independence of judgment of a reasonable person in the public officer's situation would be materially affected by: (a) The public officer's acceptance of a gift or loan; (b) The public officer's significant pecuniary interest; or (c) The public officer's commitment in a private capacity to the interests of another person. 4. In interpreting and applying the provisions of subsection 3: (a) It must be presumed that the independence of judgment of a reasonable person in the public officer's situation would not be materially affected by the public officer's acceptance of a gift or loan, significant pecuniary interest or commitment in a private capacity to the interests of another person where the resulting benefit or detriment accruing to the public officer, or if the public officer has a commitment in a private capacity to the interests of another person, accruing to the other person, is not greater than that accruing to any other member of any general business, profession, occupation or group that is affected by the matter. The presumption set forth in this paragraph does not affect the applicability of the requirements set forth in subsection 1 relating to the duty of the Attachment 6 Board Bylaws, Code of Ethics, and Conflict of Interest Policies 326 public officer to make a proper disclosure at the time the matter is considered and in the manner required by subsection 1. (b) The Commission must give appropriate weight and proper deference to the public policy of this State which favors the right of a public officer to perform the duties for which the public officer was elected or appointed and to vote or otherwise act upon a matter, provided the public officer makes a proper disclosure at the time the matter is considered and in the manner required by subsection 1. Because abstention by a public officer disrupts the normal course of representative government and deprives the public and the public officer's constituents of a voice in governmental affairs, the provisions of this section are intended to require abstention only in clear cases where the independence of judgment of a reasonable person in the public officer's situation would be materially affected by the public officer's acceptance of a gift or loan, significant pecuniary interest or commitment in a private capacity to the interests of another person. 5. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 241.0355, if a public officer declares to the body or committee in which the vote is to be taken that the public officer will abstain from voting because of the requirements of this section, the necessary quorum to act upon and the number of votes necessary to act upon the matter, as fixed by any statute, ordinance or rule, is reduced as though the member abstaining were not a member of the body or committee. 6. [Intentionally omitted] 7. [Intentionally omitted] 8. [Intentionally omitted] NRS 281A.430 which public officer or employee has interest prohibited; exceptions; request for relief from strict application of certain provisions. 1. Except as otherwise provided in this section and NRS 218A.970 and 332.800, a public officer or employee shall not bid on or enter into a contract between an agency and any business entity in which the public officer or employee has a significant pecuniary interest. 2. A member of any board, commission or similar body who is engaged in the profession, occupation or business regulated by such board, commission or body may, in the ordinary course of his or her business, bid on or enter into a contract with an agency, except the board, commission or body on which he or she is a member, if the member has not taken part in developing the contract plans or specifications and the member will not be personally involved in opening, considering or accepting offers. 3.

If a public officer who is authorized to bid on or enter into a contract with an agency pursuant to this subsection is a member of the governing body of the agency, the public officer, pursuant to the requirements of NRS 281A.420, shall disclose the public officer's interest in the contract and shall not vote on or advocate the approval of the contract. 5. A member of a local legislative body shall not, either individually or through any business entity in which the member has a significant pecuniary interest, sell goods or services to the local agency governed by his or her local legislative body unless: (a) The member, or the business entity in which the member has a significant pecuniary interest, offers the sole source of supply of the goods or services within the territorial jurisdiction of the local agency governe d by his or her local legislative body; (b) The local legislative body includes in the public notice and agenda for the meeting at which it will consider the purchase of such goods or services a clear and conspicuous statement that it is considering purchasing such goods or services from one of its members, or from a business entity in which the member has a significant pecuniary interest; (c) At the meeting, the member discloses his or her significant pecuniary interest in the purchase of such goods or s ervices and does not vote upon or advocate the approval of the matter pursuant to the requirements of NRS 281A.420; and (d) The local legislative body approves the purchase of such goods or services in accordance with all other applicable provisions of law. 6. The Commission may relieve a public officer or employee from the strict application of the provisions of this section if: (a) The public officer or employee files a request for an advisory opinion from the Commission pursuant to NRS 281A.675; and (b) The Commission determines that such relief is not contrary to: (1) The best interests of the public; (2) The continued ethical integrity of each agency affected by the matter; and (3) The provisions of this chapter. 7.

My 17+ years in education have spanned pre -K through adult, ranging from teaching preschool for homeless students, teaching elementary and middle school, instructional coaching, teaching English as a second language to adults, to being a building and a central office administrator. Currently, I am a Director in the Office of Compliance and Monitoring in the Student Services Division. I have, however, been looking to reset my passion and move back into a building. I am quite confident that my wide range of background experience and skills demonstrate that I possess the qualifications required to help advance the learning of all TVHS students and help improve the community by supporting its philosophy and goals. I have been a strong supporter and employee of the Clark County School Dist rict for many years, however, I have never had the opportunity to work in a building as unique as TVHS. I am currently on the School Board for TVHS because I believed so strongly in its mission from the very beginning. I am willing to give up my seat on the Board for the chance to run a high school that truly serves the community and allows all students a safe space to learn and grow. As a former building administrator, I have handled parent complaints, teacher conflicts, and student concerns for several ye ars. I have been an administrator at schools with 3, 4, and 5 star rankings and understand the pressures and challenges that come from successful school leadership. I have been an administrator at schools that have experienced growth in student achievement , and I understand the pressures and challenges of maintaining student achievement growth, while continuing the upward trend. I am also looking to become a familiar face in the community and continue to build the family/school partnership. In my current central office position, I have taken my leadership skills to a higher level, while developing new knowledge in the area of special education. Not only do I interact daily with district staff, community members, and stakeholders, I Potential Leadership Team Cover Letter and Resume - Lin Soriano Attachment 8 Leadership Team Resumes 376 facilitate resolution meetings, participate in mediations, and represent the district at due process hearings. Difficult situations arise regularly and I help solve them in a professional and timely manner. As my resume outlines, I have supervised numerous focus areas as a dean an d an assistant principal, expanding beyond the traditional roles of each position. My prior and current supervisors have given me expanded responsibilities that I have made my own and taken away very valuable lessons that will serve me well as I move alon g in my career. Before I left my past building position, I was tasked with helping to create the brand new Nevada Learning Academy (NVLA) Elementary School-a fully online school for students grades 3- 5. This massive undertaking (in less than two months!) debuted in August 2020 and I am proud of my role in helping create this premier online institute. I also organized a community partnership program between my last school and The Embracing Project, a community resource for girls victimized by sex trafficking. I worked with the program leaders and we have started a non-traditional educational path for these young ladies. In addition to The Embracing Project, I have had extensive dealings with many other community resources through my completion of William S. Boyd Law School. While involved in the Thomas and Mack Legal Clinic, I was a volunteer educational advocate for multiple foster children in CCSD schools. Helping bridge the gap between public services, community resources, and the Clark County School Distri ct, not only gave me an immense feeling of satisfaction, it gave me a different lens to view my job. Through this experience, I worked with resolving legal issues for these students regarding special education. We advocated for proper implementation of student IEPs, working hand in hand with classroom teachers, building administrators, and parents and guardians. I have excelled at working with the community-everything from setting up a new program for at- risk students, coordinating volunteers to come into t he classroom to promote financial literacy such as Junior Achievement, and organizing a fall festival with dozens of businesses and resources. Under my supervision, the NVLA middle school achieved a five star ranking for two years. ELA and mathematics scores were among the top in the district. Since student numbers were small, that presented new challenges in achieving those rankings. I have a philosophy of truly reaching every student and maximizing their potential. I have supervised dozens of teachers in middle school and high school in a full range of subjects. I bring in my experience from instructional coaching to my supervision feedback conferences and the evaluation cycle. I maintain a positive relat ionship with all staff members and improve the school-wide climate through both formal and informal \"shout out\" programs. I also worked with my co- assistant principal and created a structure for teachers to analyze class achievement data and make impactful instructional changes in order to improve student outcomes. NVLA saw an overall decrease in the D/F in the last three years, which I attribute to a more formalized process of data analysis than what was in place years prior. Potential Leadership Team Cover Letter and Resume - Lin Soriano Attachment 8 Leadership Team Resumes 377 Keeping instruction at the forefront, I spent my days in a building observing the delivery of instruction and interacting with students. I provided targeted opportunities for teacher growth and professional development. I instituted new practices at my most recent school in the area of curriculum alignment, Quality Matters, common grading practices, minimum F policy, analysis of common and district assessment data to drive instruction, and a tiered student support system. Although my juris doctor is not directly related to the path I plan to pursue as a principal, I have applied the experiences in law school to my current leadership. Law school also gave me an opportunity to sharpen my mediation and alternative dispute resolution skills. I received top grades in courses with a dispute r esolution focus and I immediately transferred that knowledge and those skills to my role as a building leader. It is sometimes necessary to have difficult supervisory conversations with staff members, something I have learned to do well. De- escalating diff icult situations, either with staff, parents, or students, is a strength of mine that continues to grow. Other strengths of mine include not only my desire for self -improvement, but empowering others to develop their own leadership and instructional skills. I foster strong working relationships with all stakeholders and facilitate the integration of initiatives designed to enhance the school and working environments. I appreciate your consideration of my application for principal of The Village High School and I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can serve the staff, students, and the community.

Scott Attachment 8 Leadership Team Resumes 380 8232 Charles Turk Drive Las Vegas, NV 89145 June 10, 2021 To Whom It May Concern: I am writing to apply for the principal position at The Village High School. I am currently an assistant principal at Del Sol Academy of the Performing Arts with the Clark County School District. My ability to build positive relationships as an instructional leader will allow me to become a great addition to The Village High School community. I come prepared with a variety of teaching and administrative experiences and recent coursework in instructional strategies that allow the integration of curricula across disciplines. During my employment as an assistant principal, I have performed most duties at the high school level. From facilities to curriculum administrator, I have implemented a variety of programs that address curricular needs as well as cultural and socio-economic differences. For instance, as the Career Technical Education (CTE) supervisor, I developed our Cyber Security strand as a part of our curriculum and aligned the program to state and district standards. As an instructional leader, I work with teachers to use assessment data to confirm evidence of successful learning. I have been working toward reengaging disconnected and disadvantaged students for my entire career. I mentor students to focus them Dn matriculation and help them succeed in the world beyond the classroom. I genuinely believe that we are all lifelong learners and would like the opportunity to instill that value in students and show them everyone matters. I hope to discuss how my abilities and experience can best meet the goals of The Village High School community. Thank you for your consideration, and I hope to hear from you soon. Sincerely, Mary B.

We will create a safe space and accepting culture where all students can learn and be successful. We are a charter school that is committed to creating and sustaining an exceptional education for students whose needs cannot be met in traditional environments. 1.2 Employee Handbook This Employee Handbook (\"Handbook\") is designed to summarize certain personnel policies and benefits of The Village High School (the \"Company\"), of TBD, North Las Vegas, Nevada _________________, and to acquaint employees with many of the rules concerning employment with the Company. This Handbook applies to all employees, and compliance with the Company's policies is a condition of employment. This Handbook supersedes all previous employment policies, written and oral, express and implied. The Company reserves the right to modify, rescind, delete, or add to the provisions of this Handbook from time to time in its sole and absolute discretion. This Employee Handbook is not a binding contract between the Company and its employees, nor is it intended to alter the at-will employment relationship between the Company and its employees. The Company reserves the right to interpret the policies in this Handbook and to deviate from them when, in its discretion, it determines it is appropriate. 1.3 Changes in Policy Since our business is constantly changing, the Company expressly reserves the right to revise, modify, delete, or add to any and all policies, procedures, work rules, or benefits stated in this handbook or in any other document, except for the policy of at-will employment as described below. No oral statements or representations can in any way alter the provisions of this Handbook. Nothing in this employee handbook or in any other document, including benefit plan descriptions, creates or is intended to create a promise or representation of continued employment for any employee. Any changes to your at- will employment status, described below, must be in writing and must be signed by the Company. Employment Handbook Attachment 15 Operational Execution Plan 530 If you are uncertain about any policy or procedure, please check with your manager or Human Resources. 1.4 Employment-At-Will Employment with the Company is on an at-will basis, unless otherwise specified in a written employment agreement. You are free to resign at any time, for any reason, with or without notice. Similarly, the Company is free to conclude the employment relationship at any time for any lawful reason, with or without cause, and with or without notice. Nothing in this Handbook will limit the right of either party to terminate an at-will employment. No section of this Handbook is meant to be construed, nor should be construed, as establishing anything other than an employment-at -will relationship. This Handbook does not limit management's discretion to make personnel decisions such as reassignment, change of wages and benefits, demotion, etc. No person other than the CEO, President, or CFO has the authority to enter into an agreement for employment for any specified period of time or to make an agreement for employment other than at-will terms. Only the CEO, President, or CFO of the Company has the authority to make any such agreement, which is only binding if it is in writing and signed by the President of the Company. Section 2 Employment Policies 2.1 Employee Classifications The following terms are used to describe employees and their employment status: Exempt Employees - Employees whose positions meet specific tests established by the Federal Labor Standards Act (\"FLSA\") and Nevada state law. In general, exempt employees are those engaged in executive, managerial, high-level administrative and professional jobs who are paid a fixed salary and perform certain duties. In addition, certain commissioned sales employees and highly paid computer professionals are exempt. Exempt employees are not subject to the minimum wage and overtime laws. Nonexempt Employees - Employees whose positions do not meet specific tests established by the FLSA and Nevada state law. All employees who are covered by the federal or state minimum wage and overtime laws are considered nonexempt. Employees working in nonexempt jobs are entitled to be paid at least the minimum wage per hour and a premium for overtime. Employment Handbook Attachment 15 Operational Execution Plan 531 Full-Time Employees - Employees who are not temporary employees, independent contractors, or independent consultants and who are regularly scheduled to work a schedule of 40 hours per work week. Part-Time Employees - Employees who are not temporary employees, independent contractors, or independent consultants and who are regularly scheduled to work less than 40 hours per work week. Temporary Employees - Employees who are hired as interim replacements to temporarily supplement the workforce or to assist in the completion of a specific project. Employment assignments in this category are of limited duration and the temporary employee can be let go before the end of the defined period. Short term assignments generally are periods of three (3) months or less, however, such assignments may be extended. All Temporary employees are at-will regardless of the anticipated duration of the assignment (see Employment-at -Will Policy). Temporary employees retain that status unless and until notified in writing of a change. Independent Contractor or Consultant - These individuals are not employees of the Company and are self-employed. An independent contractor or consultant is engaged to perform a task according to his/her own methods and is subject to control and direction only as to the results to be accomplished. Independent contractors or consultants are not entitled to benefits. Each employee will be advised of his or her status at the time of hire and any change in status. Regardless of the employee's status, the employee is employed at-will and the employment relationship can be terminated by the Company or the employee at any time, with or without cause and with or without notice. 2.2 Equal Employment Opportunity & Americans with Disabilities Act It is the policy of the Company to provide equal employment opportunities to all employees and employment applicants without regard to unlawful considerations of race, religion, creed, color, national origin, sex, pregnancy, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, ancestry, physical or mental disability, genetic information, marital status or any other classification protected by applicable local, state or federal laws. This policy prohibits unlawful discrimination based on the perception that anyone has any of those characteristics, or is associated with a person who has or is perceived as having any of those characteristics. This policy applies to all aspects of employment, including, but not Employment Handbook Attachment 15 Operational Execution Plan 532 limited to, hiring, job assignment, working conditions, compensation, promotion, benefits, scheduling, training, discipline and termination. The Company expects all employees to support our equal employment opportunity policy, and to take all steps necessary to maintain a workplace free from unlawful discrimination and harassment and to accommodate others in line with this policy to the fullest extent required by law. For example, the Company will make reasonable accommodations for employees' observance of religious holidays and practices unless the accommodation would cause an undue hardship on the Company's operations. If you desire a religious accommodation, you are required to make the request in writing to your manager as far in advance as possible. You are expected to strive to find co-workers who can assist in the accommodation (e.g. trade shifts) and cooperate with the Company in seeking and evaluating alternatives. Moreover, in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), the Company provides reasonable accommodations to qualified individuals with disabilities to the fullest extent required by law. The Company may require medical certification of both the disability and the need for accommodation. Keep in mind that the Company can only seek to accommodate the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual. Therefore, it is your responsibility to come forward if you are in need of an accommodation. The Company will engage in an interactive process with the employee to identify possible accommodations, if any will help the applicant or employee perform the job. 2.3 Confidentiality In the course of employment with the Company, employees may have access to \"Confidential Information\" regarding the Company, which may include its business strategy, future plans, financial information, contracts, suppliers, customers, personnel information or other information that the Company considers proprietary and confidential. Maintaining the confidentiality of this information is vital to the Company's competitive position in the industry and, ultimately, to its ability to achieve financial success and stability. Employees must protect this information by safeguarding it when in use, using it only for the business of the Company and disclosing it only when authorized to do so and to those who have a legitimate business need to know about it. This duty of confidentiality applies whether the employee is on or off the Company's premises, and during and even after the end of the employee's employment with the Company. This duty of confidentiality also applies to communications transmitted by the Company's electronic communications. See also Internet, Email and Computer Use policy, herein. Employment Handbook Attachment 15 Operational Execution Plan 533 As a condition of employment with the Company, all employees must sign a Non- Disclosure Agreement. 2.4 Employment of Minors The FLSA's child labor provisions, which the Company strictly adheres to, are designed to protect the educational opportunities of youth and prohibit their employment in jobs that are detrimental to their health and safety. Generally speaking, the FLSA sets the minimum age for employment (14 years for non-agricultural jobs), restricts the hours youth under the age of 16 may work, and prohibits youth under the age of 18 from being employed in hazardous occupations. In addition, the FLSA establishes subminimum wage standards for certain employees who are less than 20 years of age, full-time students, student learners, apprentices, and workers with disabilities. Employers generally must have authorization from the U.S. Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division (WHD) in order to pay sub-minimum wage rates. 2.5 Employment of Relatives The Company recognizes that the employment of relatives in certain circumstances, such as when they will work in the same department, supervise or manage the other, or have access to confidential or sensitive information regarding the other, can cause problems related to supervision, safety, security or morale, or create conflicts of interest that materially and substantially disrupt the Company's operations. When the Company determines any of these problems will be present, it will decline to hire an individual to work in the same department as a relative. Relatives subject to this policy include: father, mother, sister, brother, current spouse or domestic partner, child (natural, foster, or adopted), current mother-in- law, current father-in-law, grandparent, or grandchild. If present employees become relatives during employment, the Company should be notified so that we may determine whether a problem involving supervision, safety, security or morale, or a conflict of interest that would materially and substantially disrupt the Company's operations exists. If the Company determines that such a problem exists, the Company will take appropriate steps to resolve the problem, which may include reassignment of one relative (if feasible) or asking for the resignation of one of the relatives. 2.6 Personnel Records and Employee References The Company maintains a personnel file and payroll records for each employee as required by law. Personnel files and payroll records are the property of the Company and Employment Handbook Attachment 15 Operational Execution Plan 534 may not be removed from Company premises without written authorization. Because personnel files and payroll records are confidential, access to the records is restricted. Generally, only those who have a legitimate reason to review information in an employee's file are allowed to do so. Disclosure of personnel information to outside sources will be limited. However, the Company will cooperate with requests from authorized law enforcement or local, state, or federal agencies conducting official investigations and as otherwise legally required. Employees may contact a Human Resources representative to request a time to review their payroll records and/or personnel file. With reasonable advance notice, an employee may review his or her own records in the Company's offices during regular business hours and in the presence of an individual appointed by the Company to maintain the records. You also have the right to obtain a copy of your personnel files, but you may be required to pay for any such copies. You may add your comments to any disputed item in the file. By policy, the Company will provide only the former or present employee's dates of employment and position(s) held with the Company. Compensation information may also be verified if written authorization is provided by the employee. 2.7 Privacy The Company is respectful of employee privacy. All employee demographic and personal information will be shared only as required in the normal course of business. Healthcare enrollment information is kept in a separate folder from other human resources forms. Workers' Compensation information is not considered private healthcare information; however, this information will be released only on a need-to-know basis. The Company does not make or receive any private healthcare information through the course of normal work. If any employee voluntarily shares private healthcare information with a member of management, this information will be kept confidential. If applicable, the Company will set up guidelines for employees and management to follow to ensure that company employees conform to the requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). 2.8 Immigration Law Compliance In compliance with the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, each new employee, as a condition of employment, must complete the Employment Eligibility Employment Handbook Attachment 15 Operational Execution Plan 535 Verification Form I-9 on the date of hire and present documentation establishing identity and employment eligibility within three business days of date of hire. Former employees who are rehired must also complete an I-9 form if they have not completed an I-9 form with the Company within the past three years, or if their previous I-9 form is no longer retained or valid. You may raise questions or complaints about immigration law compliance without fear of reprisal. 2.9 Political Neutrality Maintenance of individual freedom and our political institutions necessitates broad scale participation by citizens concerning the selection, nomination and election of our public office holders. The Company will not discriminate against any employee because of identification with and support of any lawful political activity. Company employees are entitled to their own personal political position. The Company will not discriminate against employees based on their lawful political activity engaged in outside of work. If you are engaging in political activity, however, you should always make it clear that your actions and opinions are your own and not necessarily those of the Company, and that you are not representing the Company. Section 3 Hours of Work and Payroll Practices 3.1 Pay Periods and Paydays Employees are paid on a bi-monthly basis. All employees will be paid on the 15th and the last day of the month. All employees are paid by check or direct deposit on the above- mentioned payday. If the regular payday falls on a weekend or Company holiday, employees will be paid on the last business day before the holiday and/or weekend. 3.2 Overtime Nonexempt employees will be paid in accordance with federal and Nevada state law. In Nevada, the standard work week for employees should not exceed 8 hours in a day, if the employee's regular rate of pay is less than one and one-half times the minimum wage; or 40 hours in a week, for all employees. Should the Company find it necessary to employ an employee in excess of this standard, overtime hours shall be compensated at the rate of one and one-half times the regular rate of pay. All overtime work by non-exempt employees must be authorized in advance by their manager. Only hours actually worked will be used to calculate overtime pay. Employment Handbook Attachment 15 Operational Execution Plan 536 3.3 Rest and Meal Periods All rest and meal periods will be in accordance with Nevada state law. Nonexempt employees will be provided a 10-minute rest break for every four hour period, or major fraction of, worked. This time is counted and paid as time worked. Nonexempt employees scheduled to work a continuous eight hour period will be provided a 30-minute unpaid meal period. 3.4 Time Cards Nonexempt employees are required to keep an accurate and complete record of their attendance and hours worked. Time cards are official business records and may not be altered without the employee's supervisor's approval and may not be falsified in any way. 3.5 Payroll Deductions Various payroll deductions are made each payday to comply with federal and state laws pertaining to taxes and insurance. Deductions will be made for the following: Federal and State Income Tax Withholding, Social Security, Medicare, State Disability Insurance & Family Temporary Disability Insurance, and other items designated by you or required by law (including a valid court order). You can adjust your federal and state income tax withholding by completing the proper federal or state form and submitting it to Accounting or Human Resources. At the start of each calendar year, you will be supplied with your Wage and Tax Statement (W-2) form for the prior year. This statement summarizes your income and deductions for the year. 3.6 Wage Garnishment A garnishment is a court order requiring an employer to remit part of an employee's wages to a third party to satisfy a just debt. Once the Company receives the legal papers ordering a garnishment, we are required by law to continue making deductions from your check until we have withheld the full amount or until we receive legal papers from the court to stop the garnishment. Even if you have already paid the debt, we still need the legal papers to stop the garnishment. 3.7 Direct Deposit Employment Handbook Attachment 15 Operational Execution Plan 537 All employees are encouraged, but not required, to use direct deposit and have their paychecks deposited into a bank account of an accredited participating bank or credit union. Section 4 Standards of Conduct and Employee Performance 4.1 Anti- Harassment and Discrimination Diversity & Inclusion Policy The Company is dedicated to creating and maintaining an atmosphere of diversity and inclusion for all. Company values are important, and are only made better by gathering the experiences, knowledge, and perspectives of people from all walks of life. We celebrate differences in age, race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, physical and mental ability, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, family and marital status, and all the various backgrounds that help shape us all. The Company's commitment to diversity applies to hiring practices, promotions, pay and benefits, terminations, training, teambuilding, and more. Prospective employees and current employees alike are expected to treat each other, and be treated, with respect and dignity. We seek to foster an environment that promotes: A healthy, collaborative, and courteous atmosphere. Engagement from all employees that allows for more varied insights. Adjustability, where appropriate, to allow for an individual's personal needs. Initiatives from the Company and the employees that encourage growth in the community. The Company is committed to providing a work environment free of sexual or any form of unlawful harassment or discrimination. Harassment or unlawful discrimination against individuals on the basis of race, religion, creed, color, national origin, sex, pregnancy, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, ancestry, physical or mental disability, genetic information, marital status or any other classification protected by local, state or federal laws is illegal and prohibited by Company policy. Such conduct by or towards any employee, contract worker, customer, vendor or anyone else who does business with the Company will not be tolerated. Any employee or contract worker who violates this policy will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of his or her employment or engagement. To the extent a customer, vendor or other Employment Handbook Attachment 15 Operational Execution Plan 538 person with whom the Company does business engages in unlawful harassment or discrimination, the Company will take appropriate corrective action. Names/ Pronouns: Employees have the right to be addressed by the name and pronoun that correspond to the employee's gender identity, upon request. A court-ordered name or gender change is not required. The intentional or persistent refusal to respect an employee's gender identity (for example, intentionally referring to the employee by a name or pronoun that does not correspond to the employee's gender identity) can constitute harassment and is a violation of this policy. If you are unsure what pronoun a transitioning coworker might prefer, you can politely ask your coworker how they would like to be addressed. Prohibited Conduct: Prohibited harassment or discrimination includes any verbal, physical or visual conduct based on sex, race, age, national origin, disability or any other legally protected basis if: a. submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual's employment or engagement; b. submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as a basis for decisions concerning that individual's employment or engagement; or c. it creates a hostile or offensive work environment. Prohibited harassment includes (but is not limited to) unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors and lewd, vulgar or obscene remarks, jokes, posters or cartoons, and any unwelcome touching, pinching or other physical contact. Other forms of unlawful harassment or discrimination may include racial epithets, slurs and derogatory remarks, stereotypes, jokes, posters or cartoons based on race, national origin, age, disability, marital status or other legally protected categories. Prohibited harassment might also be transmitted using the Company's electronic communications system, or through other on-line conduct. Complaint Procedure: Employees or contract workers who feel that they have been harassed or discriminated against, or who witness any harassment or discrimination by an employee, contract worker, customer, vendor or anyone else who does business with the Company, should immediately report such conduct to their supervisor or any other member of management. Employment Handbook Attachment 15 Operational Execution Plan 539 Do not allow an inappropriate situation to continue by not reporting it, regardless of who is creating the situation. No employee, contract worker, customer, vendor or other person who does business with this organization is exempt from the prohibitions in this policy. In response to every complaint, the Company will conduct an investigation which may involve interviewing witnesses if warranted and, if improper conduct is found, take appropriate corrective action. To the extent that an employee or contract worker is not satisfied with the Company's handling of a harassment or discrimination complaint, he or she may also contact the appropriate state or federal enforcement agency for legal relief. 4.2 Attendance Punctuality and regular attendance are essential to the successful operation of the Company's business. If an employee is unable to report to work (or to report to work on time) for any reason, the employee must notify his or her supervisor before his or her starting time. If an employee desires to leave work for any reason during the workday, the employee must obtain the approval of his or her supervisor prior to leaving. In the event that the employee fails to call his or her supervisor or report for work for 10 consecutive workdays, the employee will be deemed to have voluntarily resigned from his or her employment with the Company and will be removed from the payroll. Excessive absenteeism or tardiness may subject the employee to disciplinary action, up to and including termination. 4.3 Discipline and Standards of Conduct As an at-will employer, the Company may impose discipline whenever it determines it is necessary or appropriate. Discipline may take various forms, including verbal counseling, written warnings, suspension, demotion, transfer, reassignment or termination. The discipline imposed will depend on the circumstances of each case; therefore, discipline will not necessarily be imposed in any particular sequence. Moreover, at any time the Company determines it is appropriate, an employee may be terminated immediately. Every organization must have certain standards of conduct to guide the behavior of employees. Although there is no possible way to identify every rule of conduct, the following is an illustrative list (not intended to be comprehensive or to limit the Company's right to impose discipline for any other conduct it deems inappropriate). Keep in mind that these standards of conduct apply to all employees whenever they are on Company property and/or conducting Company business (on or off Company property). Employment Handbook Attachment 15 Operational Execution Plan 540 Engaging in any conduct the Company deems inappropriate may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination. a. Dishonesty; b. Falsification of Company records; c. Unauthorized use or possession of property that belongs to the Company, a coworker, or of the public; d. Possession or control of illegal drugs, weapons, explosives, or other dangerous or unauthorized materials; e. Fighting, engaging in threats of violence or violence, use of vulgar or abusive language, horseplay, practical jokes or other disorderly conduct that may endanger others or damage property; f. Insubordination, failure to perform assigned duties or failure to comply with the Company's health, safety or other rules; g. Unauthorized or careless use of the Company's materials, equipment or property; h. Unauthorized and/or excessive absenteeism or tardiness; i. Lack of teamwork, poor communication, unsatisfactory performance, unprofessional conduct, or conduct improper for the workplace; j. Sexual or other illegal harassment or discrimination; k. Unauthorized use or disclosure of the Company's confidential information; l. Violation of any Company policy. 4.4 Dress Code What we wear to work is a reflection of the pride we have in our Company, in what we do, and in ourselves. Although dress code requirements will vary according to job responsibilities, we ask that your appearance at all times show discretion, good taste, and appropriateness for the safe performance of your job. 4.5 Safety The Company is committed to providing a safe workplace. Accordingly, the Company emphasizes \"safety first.\" It is the employee's responsibility to take steps to promote safety in the workplace and work in a safe manner. By remaining safety conscious, employees can protect themselves and their coworkers. Employees are expected to promptly report all unsafe working conditions, accidents and injuries, regardless of how minor so that any potential hazards can be corrected. 4.6 Substance and Abuse Employment Handbook Attachment 15 Operational Execution Plan 541 The Company is committed to providing its employees with a safe and productive work environment. In keeping with this commitment, it maintains a strict policy against the use of alcohol and the unlawful use of drugs in the workplace. Consequently, no employee may consume or possess alcohol, or use, possess, sell, purchase or transfer illegal drugs at any time while on the Company's premises or while using the Company vehicles or equipment, or at any location during work time. No employee may report to work with illegal drugs (or their metabolites) or alcohol in his or her bodily system. The only exception to this rule is that employees may engage in moderate consumption of alcohol that may be served and/or consumed as part of an authorized Company social or business event. \"Illegal drug\" means any drug that is not legally obtainable or that is legally obtainable but has not been legally obtained. It includes prescription drugs not being used for prescribed purposes or by the person to whom it is prescribed or in prescribed amounts. It also includes any substance a person holds out to another as an illegal drug. Any violation of this policy will result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination. Any employee who feels he or she has developed an addiction to, dependence upon, or problem with alcohol or drugs, legal or illegal, is strongly encouraged to seek assistance before a violation of this policy occurs. Any employee who requests time off to participate in a rehabilitation program will be reasonably accommodated. However, employees may not avoid disciplinary action, up to and including termination, by entering a rehabilitation program after a violation of this policy is suspected or discovered. 4.7 Workplace Searches All offices, desks, file drawers, cabinets, lockers, Company vehicles, and other Company equipment (including but not limited to computers, e-mail and voice mail) and facilities or any area on Company premises are the property of the Company (\"Company Property\"), and are intended for business use. Employees should have no expectation of privacy with respect to Company property and/or items stored within Company Property or on Company premises. Inspection may be conducted at any time, without notice, at the discretion of the Company. In addition, when the Company deems appropriate, employees may be required to submit to searches of their personal vehicles, parcels, purses, handbags, backpacks, brief cases, lunch boxes or any other possessions or articles brought on to the Company's premises. Employment Handbook Attachment 15 Operational Execution Plan 542 Persons entering the premises who refuse to cooperate in an inspection conducted pursuant to this policy may not be permitted to enter the premises. All employees must cooperate in an inspection; failure to do so is insubordination and will result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination. 4.8 Internet, Email and Computer Use Policy The Company uses various forms of electronic communication including, but not limited to: computers, email, telephones, voicemail, instant message, text message, Internet, cell phones and smart phones (hereafter referred to as \"electronic communications\"). The electronic communications, including all software, databases, hardware, and digital files, remain the sole property of the Company and are to be used only for Company business and not for personal use. The following rules apply to all forms of electronic communications and media that are: (1) accessed on or from Company premises; (2) accessed using the Company computer or telecommunications equipment, or via Company-paid access methods; and/or (3) used in a manner which identifies the Company. The following list is not exhaustive and the Company may implement additional rules from time to time. a. Electronic communication and media may not be used in any manner that would be discriminatory, harassing, or obscene, or for any other purpose that is illegal, against Company policy, or not in the best interest of the Company.

Employees may not install personal software on Company computer systems. b. Employee's own electronic media may only be used during breaks. All other company policies, including the Company's no tolerance for discrimination, harassment, or retaliation in the workplace apply. c. All electronic information created by any employee on Company premises or transmitted to Company property using any means of electronic communication is the property of the Company and remains the property of the Company. You should not assume that any electronic communications are private or confidential and should transmit personal sensitive information in other ways. Personal passwords may be used for purposes of security, but Employment Handbook Attachment 15 Operational Execution Plan 543 the use of a personal password does not affect the Company's ownership of the electronic information. The Company will override all personal passwords if necessary for any reason. d. The Company reserves the right to access and review electronic files, messages, internet use, blogs, \"tweets\", instant messages, text messages, email, voice mail, and other digital archives, and to monitor the use of electronic communications as necessary to ensure that no misuse or violation of Company policy or any law occurs. All such information may be used and/or disclosed to others, in accordance with business needs and the law. The Company reserves the right to keep a record of all passwords and codes used and/or may be able to override any such password system e. Employees are not permitted to access the electronic communications of other employees or third parties unless directed to do so by Company management. No employee may install or use anonymous e-mail transmission programs or encryption of e-mail communications. f. Employees who use devices on which information may be received and/or stored, including but not limited to cell phones, cordless phones, portable computers, fax machines, and voice mail communications are required to use these methods in strict compliance with the Confidentiality section of this Handbook. These communications tools should not be used for communicating confidential or sensitive information or any trade secrets. g. Access to the Internet, websites, and other types of Company-paid computer access are to be used for Company-related business only. Any information about The Village High School, its products or services, or other types of information that will appear in the electronic media about the Company must be approved before the information is placed on any electronic information resource that is accessible to others. 4.9 Social Media Policy The Village High School is committed to utilizing social media to enhance its profile and reputation, to listen and respond to customer opinions and feedback, and to drive revenue, loyalty and advocacy. We encourage employees to support our activities through their personal social networking channels while adhering to the guidelines outlined in this section. For the purpose of this section, social media and networking refers to the use of web- based and mobile applications for social interaction and the exchange of user-generated content. Social media channels can include, but are not limited to: Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube, blogs, review sites, forums, online communities and any similar online platforms. Employment Handbook Attachment 15 Operational Execution Plan 544 Employees are expected to conduct themselves in a professional manner and to respect the views and opinions of others. The Company and its employees are committed to conducting ourselves in accordance with best industry practices in social networking, to being responsible citizens and community members, to listening and responding to feedback, and to communicating in a courteous and professional manner. Behavior and content that may be deemed disrespectful, dishonest, offensive, harassing or damaging to the company's interests or reputation are not permitted. The use of social media channels on company time for personal purposes is not allowed. Any social media contacts, including \"followers\" or \"friends,\" that are acquired through accounts (including but not limited to email addresses, blogs, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, LinkedIn, or other social media networks) created on behalf of the Company will be the property of the Company. Employees must not disclose private or confidential information about the Company, its employees, clients, suppliers or customers on social networks. Employees must respect trademarks, copyrights, intellectual property and proprietary information. No third-party content should be published without prior permission from the owner. The Company maintains the right to monitor company-related employee activity in social networks. Violation of policy guidelines is grounds for discipline, up to and including termination. 4.10 Cell Phone Policy The use of personal cell phones at work is discouraged because it can interfere with work and be disruptive to others. Therefore, employees who bring personal cell phones to work are required to keep the ringer shut off or placed on vibrate mode when they are in the office, and to keep cell phone use confined to breaks and meal periods. Conversations should be had away from areas where other employees are working. When cell phone use interferes with the satisfactory performance of an employee's duties or disturbs others, the privilege of using a personal cell phone at work may be taken away and other disciplinary action, up to and including termination, may be imposed. The Company may provide cell phone allowances to employees in certain positions in an effort to improve efficiency and effectiveness. When cell phones are used for Company business, employees must comply with all Company policies governing conduct, including our policies prohibiting discrimination, harassment, and violence in the workplace. When using the cell phone in a public place, please remember to maintain the Employment Handbook Attachment 15 Operational Execution Plan 545 confidentiality of any private or confidential business information. As a courtesy to others, please shut cell phones off or place on vibrate mode during meetings. Section 5 Employee Benefits and Services 5.1 General Aside from those benefits required by state and federal regulations, The Village High School also offers additional benefits for its full-time employees. From time to time, benefits may be added or deleted from the benefits package. The Company reserves the right to make such changes. This Handbook does not contain the complete terms and/or conditions of any of the Company's current benefit plans. It is intended only to provide general explanations. For information regarding employee benefits and services, employees should contact Human Resources. 5.2 Group Health Insurance The Village High School offers a group health plan for eligible employees. The Company's group health insurance plan is offered through TBD. For more information, refer to the Company's benefits booklet for complete details and benefits. 5.3 Group Life Insurance The Village High School offers a group life insurance plan for eligible employees, including accidental death and dismemberment coverage. The Company's group life insurance plan is offered through TBD. For more information, refer to the Company's benefits booklet for complete details and benefits. 5.4 Flexible Spending Account (FSA) Under Section 125 of the IRS Code, the Company has set-up a flexible spending account for employees who wish to take advantage of this provision. This plan allows employees to withhold a portion of their salary on a pre-tax basis to cover the cost of qualifying insurance premiums, out of pocket medical expenses and dependent care expenses (child and/or elder care) such as day care expenses and in-home dependent care. An amount selected by the employee is deducted on a pre-tax basis to cover these expenses. Any unused amounts in the medical and dependent care account will be forfeited after the end of the plan year. Employment Handbook Attachment 15 Operational Execution Plan 546 5.5 COBRA Under the provisions of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) of 1986, if you are covered under the Company's group health insurance plan(s) you are entitled to continue your coverage in the event that your employment with the Company ends. Under COBRA, the Company must offer each qualified beneficiary (the employee and any covered dependents) who would otherwise lose coverage under the plan as a result of a qualifying event an opportunity to continue their insurance coverage. A qualifying event is defined as termination of employment, a reduction in the number of hours of employment, death of covered employee, divorce or legal separation, a dependent child ceases to be dependent, eligibility of the covered employee for Medicare, or an employer's bankruptcy. 5.6 Workers' Compensation All states have Workers' Compensation laws whose purpose is to promote the general welfare of people by providing compensation for accidental injuries or death suffered in the course of employment. These laws are designed to provide protection to workers suffering occupational disabilities through accidents arising out of, and in the course of employment. The Village High School carries Workers' Compensation Insurance for all employees and pays the entire cost of the insurance program. An employee who suffers an injury or illness in connection with the job is usually eligible to receive payment through the insurance company for lost wages. In addition to disability payments, necessary hospital, medical and surgical expenses are covered under Workers' Compensation, with payments being made directly to the hospital or physician. Workers' Compensation benefits to injured workers also include assistance to help qualified injured employees return to suitable employment. 5.7 Social Security Benefits (FICA) During your employment, you and the Company both contribute funds to the Federal government to support the Social Security Program. This program is intended to provide you with retirement benefit payments and medical coverage once you reach retirement age. 5.8 Unemployment Insurance The company pays a state and federal tax to provide employees with unemployment insurance coverage in the event they become unemployed through no fault of their own Employment Handbook Attachment 15 Operational Execution Plan 547 or due to circumstances described by law. This insurance is administered by applicable state agencies, who determine eligibility for benefits, the amount of benefits (if any), and duration of benefits. 5.9 Additional Benefits Nevada Public Employee Retirement System (NV PERS) Employer Paid - 29.25% Shared equally between employer and employee Employee/Employer Paid - 15.25% Section 6 Employee Leaves of Absence and Time Off 6.1 General While regular attendance is crucial to maintain business operations, the Company recognizes that, for a variety of reasons, employees may need time off from work. The Company has available a number of types of leaves of absence. Some are governed by law and others are discretionary. For all planned leaves, however, employees must submit a request at least 14 days in advance; in case of emergencies, employees should submit the request as soon as they become aware of the need for leave. All leaves must have the approval of Company management. If, during a leave, an employee accepts another job, engages in other employment or consulting outside of the Company, or applies for unemployment insurance benefits, the employee may be considered to have voluntarily resigned from employment with the Company. All requests for a leave of absence will be considered in light of their effect on the Company and its work requirements, as determined by Company management, which reserves the right to approve or deny such requests in its sole discretion, unless otherwise required by law. For disability-related leave requests, the Company will engage in an interactive process with the employee to determine if a leave is the most appropriate accommodation. The employee must provide a certification from his or her health care provider to the Company to support a leave for medical reasons. Failure to provide the required certification to the Company in a timely manner will result in delay or denial of leave. If an employee requires an extension of leave, the employee must request such extension and have it approved before the expiration of the currently approved leave. While the Company will make a reasonable effort to return the employee to his or her former position or a comparable position following an approved leave of absence, there is no guarantee that the employee will be reinstated to his or her position, or any position, except as required by law. Employment Handbook Attachment 15 Operational Execution Plan 548 6.2 Paid Time Off Days Eligible employees are entitled to ten paid time off (\"PTO\") days per year. A PTO days pay for regular full-time employees will be calculated based on the employee's base pay rate times the number of hours the employee would otherwise have worked on that day. Regular part-time employees will be paid on a pro-rata basis. Employees may not accrue more than 20 days of time off. Once an employee's time off balance reaches this limit, an employee may accrue more time off only by taking some time off to bring the balance back below the limit. When employees eligible for paid time off days do not take the full amount of vacation time they could have taken in a year, that amount automatically carries over to the next year. 6.3 Family and Medical Leave Because of the Company's small size, we are not required to comply with the federal Family and Medical Leave Act (\"FMLA\"). However, we recognize that our employees may occasionally need to take unpaid leave to care for a new child, to care for a seriously ill family member, to handle an employee's own medical issues, or to handle issues relating to a family member's military service, possibly including caring for a family member who is injured while serving in the military. If you anticipate that you might need time off to deal with family and medical issues, please speak with your supervisor. We will seriously consider every request on a case-by- case basis. 6.4 Workers' Compensation Leave Any employee who is unable to work due to a work related injury or illness and who is eligible for Workers' Compensation benefits will be provided an unpaid leave for the period required. The first 12 weeks will be treated concurrently as a family and medical leave under the federal Family Medical Leave Act (\"FMLA\") for employees eligible for FMLA leave. 6.5 Jury Duty U.S. citizens have a civic obligation to provide jury duty service when called. Employees are entitled up to three working days, with pay, at their regular straight time or base salary for jury duty. Employment Handbook Attachment 15 Operational Execution Plan 549 By state law, an employee cannot be required to use paid leave for a jury duty absence. The employee must bring in the jury duty notice as soon as it is received so that appropriate arrangements can be made to cover his or her duties. Employees are required to call in or report for work on those days or parts of days when their presence in court is not required. 6.6 Voting Time Employees who are registered voters and who lack sufficient nonwork hours when polls are open to vote in any local, state, and national election may take one hour if work is two miles or less from the polling place, two hours if work is two to ten miles from the polling place, or three hours if work is more than ten miles from the polling place. This time may be taken with pay. Employees should provide notice prior to election day when time off is required.

In addition, a social -emotional learning program, and high -level technology certification programs in piloting drones and cy bersecurity. Our mission and vision consist of 5 core beliefs: 1 - Students cannot learn if they do not feel safe. 2 - Several students are in desperate need of counseling and mental health services at school. 3 - Data- driven instruction. 4 - High-quality teachers, curriculum, and materials increase student growth. 5 - High quality professional development is vital to the success of the school. The Village High School proposes to give families the ability to attend a quality high school in which students f eel in charge of their learning, safe, and mentally healthy. We believe that our unique model will transform education, especially for the diverse and traditionally underserved student populations. Student/Parent Handbook Attachment 15 Operational Execution Plan 573 Academic Pathways The Village High School will incorporate the Summit Learning Curriculum for core curriculum classes. These classes include English, Math, Science, Social Studies. Summit Learning is a research -based approach to education designed to drive student engagement, meaningful learning, and strong student -teacher relationships that prepare students for life beyond the classroom. The Summit Learning program offers schools customizable curriculum, a range of educational resources and technology tools, professional development for educators, ongoing coaching, and support for schools. Students learn from teachers through whole group, sma ll group, and one -on-one time. Project -based and group learning allow teachers the opportunity to demonstrate for students the application of life -long learning skills via team collaboration, data interpretation, and persuasive arguments. The curriculum largely centers on real world related projects. Students connect what they are learning to life beyond the classroom. Classroom teachers will also mentor students weekly during dedicated one -on- one sessions. During these mentoring sessions students will se t long and short -term goals with their mentor. These sessions will foster strong relationships between students and mentors as they celebrate successes and discuss learning opportunities from roadblocks they need to overcome. Paired with the Summit Learni ng, TVHS will also be utilizing, during Wellness Wednesdays, the Ramsey financial curriculum, Foundations in Personal Finance. This course starts out with fundamentals of financial literacy, allowing high school students to learn about money, budgeting and their future finances. The TVHS elective choice for our secondary programming is the SEED Impact Program. SEED is a program that focuses on internal growth utilizing Social Emotional Learning (SEL). SEL intentionally develops attitudes, behaviors, and skills that are fundamental for academic and life success. SEL programming incorporates two essential benefits: 1 - Encouragement of positive, strength -based behaviors, integrated as norms for lifetime practice. 2 - Discourages behaviors associated with negative school and life outcomes. Educators, policymakers, and employers, alike, believe that SEL is key to Student/Parent Handbook Attachment 15 Operational Execution Plan 574 optimizing education and training. Working in partnership with the stage - model framework, SEED Impact, will be customized and integrated with our programming to measure, credibly report, and accelerate the learning experience of program participants. With a focus on life -transformations, SEED Impact's approach tracks major shifts in competency measured across three domains of growth: \u00b7 Being (comfort with self) \u00b7 Doing (aptitude with new skills) \u00b7 Relating (interpersonal relationships) The final piece of The Village High School Model is the technology component, GRADD.co, NVBAA, and Cyberjutsu. GRADD provides the software expertise and training to create highly accurate 3D models through drone flying, virtual reality and augmented reality. It is the world's fastest photogrammetry software. The Nevada Business Aviation Association (NVBAA) promotes aviation by developing and offering STEM education curriculum and by providing workforce training programs. Participants in the FAA Part 107 Rem ote Pilot Training will receive industry leading instruction to prepare for the exam. We have partnered with the Women's Society of Cyberjutsu (WSC), to create a unique and rigorous Cybersecurity curriculum. WSC serves thousands of women, men and girls acr oss the globe by bringing awareness to, and advancing careers in, cybersecurity. The WSC community includes information security professionals, IT professionals, programmers, computer scientists and engineers, as well as women wanting to explore and join the field. Recognizing the importance of encouraging girls to embrace a future in STEM -related professions through its Cyberjutsu Girls Academy, WSC provides a unique hands -on curriculum focused on securing information technology. WSC's mission is to advan ce women in cybersecurity careers by providing programs and partnerships that promote hands -on training, networking, education, mentoring, resource -sharing and other professional opportunities. We envision a cyber -community where all students can reach the ir full potential & thrive with unlimited opportunity.
