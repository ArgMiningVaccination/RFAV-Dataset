SLX INVENTED NON-STICK GRINDERS In 2011, we began developing the world's first non-stick herb grinder. SLX is the only company to ever be granted a patent for non-stick grinders. We weren't just the first - we continue to be the best. We developed our coating for one reason. To defeat stuck grinders once and for all. Our coating is super low friction, so a SLX turns just as easily in 6 months as it did the day you got it. It repels even the stickiest resin buildup, keeping your grinder looking and spinning like new no matter how hard you punish it. What is our coating made from? Our coating is a proprietary ceramic-silicone polymer, developed from components used to reduce friction on industrial blades and cutting tools. It will never chip, flake, or burn. That wouldn't be cool, would it? The exceptional non-stick capabilities come from a ceramic-silicone compound - not PTFE, Teflon, or any other carcinogenic chemicals. Bonded at the molecular level with the aluminum our grinders are machined from, it's as strong as steel and slick as grease. Our coating contains zero Teflon or PTFE. It's completely inert, and 100% FDA certified for food contact. Strong. Lightweight. Durable. Every SLX herb grinder is machined from 7075 aluminum, the alloy of choice for precision applications - from high performance jet aircraft to Space-X rockets. With exceptional strength, perfect balance, and unparalleled durability, your SLX grinder will last a lifetime. Machined to the highest tolerances. Each piece of your SLX non-stick herb grinder is machined to the thousandth of an inch - providing the perfection you deserve and we demand. The result? No more fumbling to connect stages. No imperfections that catch and slow you down. Just smooth threads and easy turning. More teeth than the Loch Ness Monster. With 55 razor-sharp teeth in the standard size, and 27 in the pocket size, even a velociraptor would be hard pressed to keep pace with SLX shredding power. A couple of turns is all it takes - even tough, stemmy herbs don't stand a chance against the smoothest operator in town. Nine Colors Our ceramic-silicone coating comes in 9 fantastic colors - charcoal grey, silver metallic, champaign gold and black metallic (the classic 4), yellow, leaf green, purple haze, ocean blue, and pink - all lightly metallic. Ergonomic Design Slab cuts and serrations for comfort and traction. Every SLX non-stick herb grinder features comfortable slab cuts and gentle serrations on the top and bottom. Got sweaty hands? Not a problem. Our grips provide optimal leverage even if you find yourself grinding on a row boat in a hurricane (note - we don't recommend using your SLX in this situation. Find shelter, preferably on high ground, then use your SLX to prepare for celebration in safety). TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS: SLX 2.5 4-piece herb grinder Non-Stick Ceramic Coating SLX Version 2.5 is coated inside and out with our proprietary non-stick ceramic. Every lip, every tooth - even the pollen chamber. It never sticks, and it doesn't need cleaning. Our coating is bonded with the aluminum at the molecular level, ensuring durability, is 100% non-toxic, FDA approved, and will not burn or release any harmful chemicals. ZERO Teflon\u00ae or PTFE Teflon\u00ae (PTFE) fumes are so toxic when inhaled that Dupont\u00ae had to ban its use in the tobacco industry. Even if we could use PTFE, we wouldn't - PTFE coatings are plastic based and not durable enough for serious use. You deserve the best when you buy a SLX herb grinder, and Teflon\u00ae doesn't cut it. Aerospace-Grade Aluminum Machined out of 7075 T6 aluminum to prevent cross-threading, bent and broken teeth, or other damage. Most grinders are made from weaker 6 series aluminum. 7 series is more expensive to machine, but it ensures your SLX herb grinder will last a lifetime. Premium Screens SLX herb grinders feature drum tight stainless steel screens with a fine micron size - ensuring only pollen gets filtered, not pieces of herb. Perfect for pressing. And they lift out without threads! Just 1 Set of Threads Our screen stage slips out without threads - so your pollen isn't upended every time you empty your ground herbs. The SLX Promise We put our URL on the bottom of every grinder for a reason. If you're ever dissatisfied for any reason, contact us and we'll make it right. "}
