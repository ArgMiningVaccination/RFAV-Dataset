We offer outpatient consultative care as well as inpatient hospital treatment for those who need it. In addition, the center conducts research, exploring the mechanisms of headaches and how existing and new treatments might provide relief. Our specialists work closely with you and your primary care team to develop an effective long-term treatment plan. When appropriate, we work with experts in neurosurgery, otolaryngology (ear, nose and throat) and ophthalmology (eyes and vision). We also work with specialists at the [Osher Center for Integrative Health](/clinics/osher-center-for-integrative-health), which combines conventional and alternative medicine, such as acupuncture, herbs, massage and meditation, for treating headaches. We treat patients and families with the utmost respect and compassion, with sensitivity to the diverse places and cultures from which our patients come. Pediatric patients are seen at the [UCSF Pediatric Headache Center](https://www.ucsfbenioffchildrens.org/clinics/headache_center/). Patients with pain in the temporomandibular joints (TMJs) are treated at the [UCSF Center for Orofacial Pain and Dental Sleep Medicine](https://www.ucsfdentalcenter.org/clinics/center-orofacial-pain-and-dental-sleep-medicine).
