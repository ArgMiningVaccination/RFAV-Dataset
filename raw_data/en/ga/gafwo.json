Using the owner's' observations, the vet gives the cat a full physical exam, looking for signs of the lameness, as well as what is causing the condition. During the exam, the vet may find obvious causes, such as a foreign object embedded in the footpad. Other underlying causes may not be as easy to detect. This is when the vet gives one of several kinds of tests to the cat: - X-rays - Blood testing (looking for infectious or immune system diseases) - Biopsies - Removing joint fluid with a fine needle - CT scan or MRI - Ultrasound - Neurological exam - Myelograph (injecting dye along the spinal cord and taking a special X-ray) - Electromyography (recording electrical activity of affected muscle tissue) - Endoscopic exploratory surgery Treatment of Lameness in Cats In addition to treating the underlying cause of a cat's lameness, vets want to manage the pain the cat is feeling. They will start with a less invasive treatment before moving to a more invasive pain treatment if the less invasive options don't work. The first option is pain medications, which range from nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications, which reduce joint or ligament inflammation. While the cat is taking this medication, the vet will be watching the cat closely to ensure it doesn't develop kidney, liver, or gastrointestinal damage. Along with this form of treatment, the vet may prescribe cage rest. If NSAIDS don't work, the vet will prescribe opioid pain medications, such as tramadol, buprenorphine or butorphanol. These medications are reserved for more acute pain. The cat can take oral medications or receive injections of this medication. Chondroprotectants are drugs that protect the cartilage that surrounds the joint. These medications are reserved for cats diagnosed with osteoarthritis as they work to slow degradation of the cartilage in the affected limb. Again, these medications are given orally or as injections. Complementary treatments may pain relief to the cat. These include chiropractic treatments, acupuncture, and physical therapy. Laser therapy may also be helpful. These treatments are intended to increase physical comfort to the cat as it works to return to a more normal function. Other treatments can include massage and dietary changes. If the cat has a congenital condition that limits the use of the limb or causes significant pain, the vet may suggest surgery to the cat's owner.

Recovery of Lameness in Cats Depending on the cause of a cat's lameness and it's severity, along with the method of treatment and follow-up care, the affected cat can generally recover. For cats affected by osteoarthritis, their medication will help to slow the progress of the disease as well as offer some pain relief. If the arthritic cat is also overweight, a change in cat food that allows it to lose the extra weight can also lead to more significant relief of pain and lameness. For cats diagnosed with osteoarthritis, it will be necessary to take pain relieving medications for the rest of its life. Regular veterinary follow-ups will also help improve quality of life for the pet. Cat foods that contain a higher amount of Omega 3 and 6 (fatty acids) can also provide a small amount of pain relief by improving the health of affected joints.
