[See All Faq](/pages/faq) Reviews Customer Reviews [Write a review](#) Energy Wellness Shot | Naked Fire Shot - 4 Pack It was so bad I had to just throw it out / it tasted awful. Is there a refund policy? Definitely not worth even taking a shot of it for energy benefits. You would certainly not be drinking it for the taste either. So better off not buying it! I like this one. I used to make an ACV, lemon juice and cayenne pepper elixir for the mornings. That was rough but I got used to it. This, while spicy, in my opinion is completely tolerable and the honey was a pleasant surprise. I only take half the bottle some mornings and think it's helpful. Side note: I would not sip this...I think it's called a shot with good reason. Energy Wellness Shot | Naked Fire Shot - 4 Pack "}
