General Information 2.1 History, Background and Mission of Campbell University On January 5, 1887, James Archibald Campbell welcomed 16 students to the first day of classes, thus marking the founding of Buies Creek Academy. Over the years, the Academy evolved to become Campbell Junior College (1926), Campbell College (1961) and Campbell University (1979). The mission of Campbell University is to graduate students with exemplary academic and professional skills who are prepared for purposeful lives and meaningful service. The University is informed an d inspired by its Baptist heritage and three basic theological and biblical presuppositions: learning is appointed and conserved by God as essential to the fulfillment of human destiny; in Christ all things consist and find ultimate unity; and the Kingdom of God in this world is rooted and grounded in Christian community. The University embraces the conviction that there is no conflict between the life of faith and the life of inquiry. In 2013, Campbell launched the Jerry M. Wallace School of Osteopathic Medicine, North Carolina's first new m edical school in over 35 years. In August 2016, the Catherine W. Wood School of Nursing \u2014housed within the College of Pharmacy & Health Scie nces\u2014welcomed its first cohort. Simultaneously, Campbell opened its School of Engineering, which was only the second engineering school at a private university in North Carolina. They joined Campbell's other established colleges and schools: the College of Arts & Sciences, the Norman Adrian Wiggins School of Law (1976), the Lundy -Fetterman School of Business (1983), the School of Education (1985), the College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences (1985), and the Divinity School (1996). In addition to its main campus in Buies Creek, Campbell University has off -campus instructional sites i n Camp Lejeune (Jacksonville), Fort Bragg & Pope (Fayetteville), Raleigh (2009 relocation of the law school), Sampson Correctional Institution (Clinton), and a vibrant online pre sence through Campbell Online. Today, Campbell University enrolls approximately 7,000 students per year, including more than 5,000 undergraduate and graduate students on its main campus. The University employs over 900 full -time employees, which includes over 250 full -time faculty. Over 100 degree programs in the liber al arts, health sciences, fine arts, and professions are offered. Campbell University is a private, not -for-profit, academic institution governed by an independent and self -perpetuating Board of Trustees. The University enjoys an autonomous and voluntary relationship with the Baptist State Convention of North Carolina. Campbell University is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges as a Level VI institution to award A ssociate, Baccalaureate, Masters , and Doctorate degrees and is classified as a Doctoral/Professional Universit y (D/PU) by the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education. 16 2.2 Campbell University M ission Statement The Mission of Campbell Univ ersity is to gr aduate students with e xemplary academic and prof ession al skills who are prepared for purpos eful liv es and me aningful s ervice.

Between 2012 and 2021, CUSOM started 22 new residency programs in Family Medicine, Internal Medicine, Emergency Medicine, Obstetrics -Gynecology, Dermatology, Micrographic Surgery, G eneral Surgery, Sports Medicine, Osteopathic Neuromusculoskeletal Medicine, Transitional Year, and Psychiatry . 2.6 Osteopathic History The history of CUSOM begins with the advent of osteopathy by Andrew Taylor Still, a native of Virginia. In 1854, Dr. Still, then a practicing allopathic physician in Kansas, became increasingly dissatisfied with the medical practices of his day. He developed a new theory of medicine, which he called osteopathy. He based his new approach to health care on the concepts o f body unity, the body's inherent ability to heal itself given all the optimum conditions, and on the proper alignment and function of the musculoskeletal system. CUSOM takes pride in bringing the philosophies of Dr. Still to North Carolina. Over the years, the pra ctice of medicine h as evolved and so ha s the pra ctice of osteopa thic medi cine. Today, doc tors of osteop athic medi cine (D Os) serve the public with full medical practice privil eges. Ost eopathic physicia ns are trained in a ll the mode rn practices s cience has to of fer in medic al and surgic al care while in corpor ating the concept of tr eating the whole pe rson throughout the training. Ost eopathic physici ans believe hands-on examination (palpation) is an essential p art of making a physic al diagnosis. In a ddition to pha rmacologic tr eatment and surg ery, manipulative medic ine 20 remains an import ant the rapeutic tool utiliz ed by osteopa thic physicia ns in alleviating pain and tr eating illness. The tr aining of osteop athic physi cians has a lways st ressed a primary care orientation. Four Tenets of Osteopathic Med icine 1. The body is a uni t; the person is a unit of mind, body and spirit 2. The body is capable of self-regulation, self-healing, and he alth maintenance 3. Structure and function are reciprocally interrelated 4. Rational treatme nt is based on the above three principles 2.7 Osteopathic Oath I do he reby affirm my loy alty to the profe ssion I am about to e nter. I will be mindful always of my gre at responsibility to pres erve the he alth and the life of my p atients, to retain their c onfide nce and resp ect both a s a physici an and a f riend who will gu ard their secrets with s crupulous honor a nd fid elity, to p erform faithfully my professiona l duti es, to employ only those re cogniz ed methods of tr eatm ent consist ent with good judgment and with my skill a nd ability, ke eping in mind a lways n ature's la ws and the body's inherent capacity for re covery. I will be ever vigil ant in aiding in the ge neral welfare of the c ommunity, sust aining i ts laws and institutions, not engaging in those pra ctices, whi ch will in any way, bring shame or discr edit upon my pro fession or mys elf. I will give no drugs for deadly purpos es to any person, though it be asked of me. I will e ndeavor to wo rk in a ccord with my colleagues in a spirit of progressive cooperation and never by wo rd or by act c ast imput ations upon th em or their rightful practices. I will look with resp ect and esteem upon a ll those who ha ve taught me my art. To my college I will be loy al and strive a lways for its b est int erests and for the int erests of the students who will c ome after me. I will be e ver alert to fu rther the application of ba sic biologic truths to the h ealing arts a nd to velop the enunc iated by And rew T aylor Still. 21 3. Admission 3.1 Admissions Process CUSOM h as adopted admissions polici es and criteria designed to me et its Mission to educate and tr ain outst anding community -based osteopa thic physicia ns to c are for the rural and underserved populations in No rth Carolina, the Southe astern United Stat es, and the na tion. CUSOM fa culty, st aff, and students va lue t eamwo rk, le adership, pro fession alism, integrity, dive rsity, and the ethical tre atment of all humanity. The guiding principles of the CUS OM Office of Admissions a re to: 1. Review each applicant as a whole person: Mind, Body, and Spirit. 2. Evaluate each applicant's potential for success in the Do ctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO) curriculum. 3. Assess each applicant's commitme nt and aptitude as a future practicing osteopathic physician. 4. Consider each a pplicant's interest in serving rural and unde rserved popul ations . 5. Help confirm the a pplicant's commitm ent to the CUSOM Mission and the osteopathic profession. The O ffice of Admissions ensures qua lified students a re selected for mat riculation to the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine Progr ell Univ ersity. CUSOM is commi tted to s electing applicants who align with our Mission and our v alues and who will be an asset to the pro fession of osteopa thic medi cine. Wh en ations, the goals of the Of fice of Admissions include, but are not limited to, evaluating : Each a pplicant as a whole person. Each a pplicant's interest in serving rural and unde rserved popul ations . Each a pplicant's potential succes s as a Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine. Each a pplicant's compassion, knowledge, and commitment to healthcare and the CUSOM Mission . The CUSOM Admissions Commi al Coll ege Admissions T est (MCAT) s cores, letters of re comm endation, he alth-related work and research and volunt eer exp erience. In addition to a cademic p erformance, the Admissions Committee pla ces emphasis on the ethical treatment of all humanity, the d emonstr ation of pe rsonal merit, compassion, community goa ls, and the promotion of dive rsity. 22 Faculty and staff evaluations provided after each candidate's interview are utilized by the Admissions Committee in making their recommendation to the Dean regarding whether the candidate should be granted or denied acceptance. The D ean conside rs the recommend ations f rom the committee before making the final d ecision on each candidate. The Dean , as the Chief Academic Officer, makes all final decisions on candidate status. The CUSOM Offi ce of Admissions maintains pre -admission academic and demogr aphic d ata for e ach mat riculating class. Upon gradua tion, the Of fice of the Registrar wo rks in conjun ction with the CUSOM Alumni Asso ciation and creditation and M edical Educ ation to tr ack amination performance, spec ialty certifica tion, post -gradu ate employment, and career activities for each gradua ting c lass. Through this process, CUSOM is able to evaluate and adjust recruitm ent practices and policies to e nsure the Mission a nd Go als of the institution a re being met. 3.2 Requireme nts for Admission To be consid ered for an int erview, appli cants to CUSOM are requir ed to compl ete a minimum of 75 per cent of the r equired credits for a degree at a c ollege or unive rsity accredit ed by an age ncy r ecogniz ed by the United Stat es Department of Education. To be c onsid ered for admission, a pplicants must h ave earned, or are scheduled to earn, a baccalaur eate d egree prior to mat riculation at CUSOM and submit s cores f rom the Medical Coll ege Admission T est (MCAT ). For the current admission cycle, CUSOM will accept the MCAT administration up to thr ee years prior to the ye ar of mat riculation unless with the D ean's e xception. Most competitive applicants to CUSOM have MCAT s cores at the 50th percentile or higher. The most competitive a pplicants h ave high er MCAT scores. Applicants should have achieved at least a 3.2 Science and Overall cumulative grade point average (GPA) on a 4.0 scale. The most competitive applicants have higher Science and Overall cumulative GPAs. The admissions process is highly competitive, and higher GPAs and MCAT scores may increase chances for acceptance. CUSOM also places emphasis on the applicant's interview. The requir ed und ergradua te courses for entry a re: Biological Sciences: One year with l aboratory (8 semest er hours/12 qua rter hours) Physics: One year (6 to 8 semest er hours/9 to 12 q uarter hours) Inorganic/General Chemistry: One year with la boratory (8 semester hours/12 quarter hours) Organic Ch emistry: One year w ith labo ratory (8 semest er hours/12 qua rter hours ); the second semester of Organic Chemistry can be substituted by Biochemistry 23 English: One year (6 semest er hours/8 qua rter hours) Six (6) additional science hours are highly recommended. CUSOM recommends courses in the 300/400 level or higher, such as Anatomy, Physiology, Biochemistry, Genetics, Mic robiol ogy, and Immunolo gy, which may enhance pe rformance in medi cal school. NOTE: Courses with equivalent content will be reviewed. NOTE: Students must obtain a grade of \"C\" or better in each of the required courses above to fulfill the pre-requisite course requirement. Applic ants are require d to me et the T echnical Standards, including required immunizations for healthcare workers, for a dmission and continu ed enrollm ent, and affirm that he or she meets the standa rds. Any falsifica tion or misinfor mation (e.g. not disclosing prior to mat riculation a known, pre -existing, issue whi ch would le ad to not meeting the Te chnical Standards) regarding the a bility to me et the T echnic al Standards may result in dismissal f rom the program. Applic ants must submit all requir ed paperwork per published d eadlines outlined by the Office of Admissions. If p aperwork is not submitted and received a s required, an off er of admission may be rescinded. 3.3 Technical S tandards and Vaccination Requirements for Admission to CUSOM The requir ements to su cceed at CUSOM are those n ecessary to su ccessfully compl ete the curriculum and to pra ctice osteop athic medic ine with full pra ctice rights. Students must be a ble to function in a variety of le arning and clinical settings, and to quickly, accurately, and consistently le arn and proc ess data. Ost eopathic physici ans utilize palpation (clinic ally appropri ate touching) a s part of the physical examination and osteopa thic approa ch to tr eatme nt. As pa rt of the education al proc ess, CUSOM students must be able to tol erate b eing palpated , examined and rec eive ost eopathic manipulation by memb ers of all genders, and to palpate , examine , and provide osteopa thic manipulation to othe rs (of all genders) in order to ac quire the skills n ecessary for palpation and examination. This p alpation is p erformed in a profe ssion al and appropriate manner. Acquiring the skills to palpate and examine p atients requir es a student to examine partially disrobe d patients of all genders and is mandatory for suc cessful c ompletion of the curriculum at CUSOM. Students are requir ed to parti cipate fully as both the examiner and e xaminee in v arious clinical labor atory experiences. In Clinical Skills and Osteop athic Manip ulative M edicine laboratory experiences, as well as oth er clinic al laboratori es where physical examination skills are acquir ed, students a re require d to participate in the examination of fellow students of all gend ers who may be partially disrob ed. 24 In order to be able to ga in appropri ate clinical exposure to the regions be ing examined and osteop athic manipulative te chniques to be performed , students n eed to w ear attire, such as shorts and are expected to partially disrobe for c ertain labo ratory experiences. Please refer to the Dress Code Policy (Section 6.5 of this Bulletin ) for additional information. Addition ally, CUSOM utiliz es cadavers in the gross a natomy laboratory. As suc h, CUSOM students must be a ble to tole rate wo rking with, a nd touching, c adavers. CUSOM students also pa rticipate in ultrasound l abs and, as such, will be requir ed to perform ultr asound examination of fellow students of all genders who may be pa rtially disrob ed. These are requirements for all students, regardless of cultural o r religious beliefs, except where required by law . Students who have any concern regarding these requirements should discuss them with the Executive Director of Student Affairs prior to applying. CUSOM will make re asonable accommod ations as requir ed by law for students whose disabilities will not prev ent them f rom su ccessfully compl eting the entire CUSOM curriculum and gradua ting as an ost eopathic physici an (Section 3.5 of this Bulletin ). Students, how ever, are required to function with indep endence and perform at all skill levels described below which CUSOM holds as mand atory for the safe and effective practice of ost eopathic medicine. CUSOM is c ommitted to p atient saf ety and assuring a safe and ef fective environment that doe s not pla ce patients, stude nts, or othe rs at unnecessary risk. E ach Te chnical Stand ard has been chosen from standards osteopa thic physici ans deem necessary for the safe and pr actice of osteop athic medi cine.

The last day for a pplic ants to submit their S econd ary Application and supporting materi als is March 15 , but an ea rlier submission is highly e ncourag ed. 3.7 Early Decision Admissions Track The E arly Decision Admissions T rack is an admissions option for candidat es who identify CUSOM a s their fi rst choice amongst both osteop athic and allopathic medical schools for pursuing a medi cal education. To be c onsid ered for the E arly D ecision Admissions T rack, the ca ndidate must me et all the following requir ements and agr ee to apply only to CUSOM until a n early de cision notifi cation h as been mad e. Ple ase note the E arly De cision Admissions T rack requir ements are in a ddition to the minimum requir ements for a dmissions list ed in Section s 3.2 and 3.3 of t his Bulletin . Early Decision Admissions Track Requirements Minimum Science and O verall GPA of 3.50 on a 4.0 scale. Recent M CAT score (by August of the calen dar year the application for Early Decision is being submitted ; MCAT scores may accepted up to thr ee years prior to the date of a pplication) w ith a minimum s core at the 50th percentile. Submit an a pplication, of ficial tr anscript f rom all institutions attended, and official MCAT scores to AACOMAS by September 15 of the year preceding matriculation. Submit a letter of intent to the Office of Admissions indicating that CUSOM is your first choice for medi cal schools by September 15 and request review for Early Decision Admissions Track. Submit all seconda ry application materials including Second ary Application, application fee or AACOMAS fee waiver , letter of recom mendation from a premedi cal advisor or science faculty memb er (typically a PhD) , and letter of recommendation from an osteopa thic or a llopathic physician by September 15 . The letter of intent shoul d indicate all applications to other medi cal schools will be withheld until early decisions are made by CUSOM. Students will be notified no lat er than October 15 . 29 3.8 Application Process Step 1: AACO MAS Application CUSOM p articipates with other S ervice (AACOMAS). An application may be submitted online a t https://choosedo.org . Detailed instructions can be accessed through and questions can be answered by contacting: AACOMAS aacomasinfo@liaisoncas.com Telephone: (617) applic ants must apply dire ctly to AACOMAS. AACOM AS is a vailable to the students for the entering class from May through March of the year applying. Applicants must request all official transcripts from all colleges and universities attended to be mailed directly from the institution(s) to the AACOMAS office. Students should also ensure all MCAT score s are forwarded directly to AACOMAS from the AAMC. Applicants who have taken course work and/or have earned a degree from a foreign institution must also submit to AACOMAS an evaluation of their transcripts in a course -by-course fashion from one of the AA COMAS -approved evaluation services. The evaluation service must verify course work completed at an institution outside of the US is comparable to a regionally accredited US college or university in a course -by-course fashion. Step 2: CUSOM Secon dary Ap plication Process After receipt of the AACOMAS application, CUSOM performs an initial screening of the application. Applicants who pass the initial screening may be invited to submit an electronic Secondary Application and supporting documents. Please note CUSOM screens all primary applications , and not all applicants will receive an invitation to submit a Secondary Application. Applicants invited to submit a Secondary Application will receive an email notification. This email will contain information and instructions on how to complete the Secondary Application and submit the processing fee. A non- refundable fee of $50.00 is payable upon submission of the Secondary Application for adm ission. CUSOM w aives this fee if the applic ant has an approved AAC OMAS f ee waiver document. 30 In addition to the Se condary Applic ation and non -refund able proc essing fe e or AACOMAS fee waiver , applicants must submit two requir ed lette rs of recomm endation. Letters of recommendation must be origina ls on pro fession al or college/university lette rhead and sign ed by the e valuator. L etters of recomm endation may not be written by a r elative, in cluding relatives through marriage. CUSOM accepts lette rs through A ACOM AS, Inter folio a nd mail. Letters of recommendation which are included as a part of the pre -health committee packet or letters from an official evaluation collection service (AACOMAS or Interfolio) recognized by CUSOM as a part of their official packet and are accepted without sign ature or letterhead, as long as the letters are sent directly from the authors to the pre -health committee. If the applicant's school does not utilize a pre - health committee, a letter must be from a science PhD faculty member f amiliar with the academic wo rk of the applicant. A second letter of recommendation must be from either an osteopathic physician (DO) or an allopathic physician (MD). Although a letter from an osteopathic physician is not required, it is strongly recommended. While shadowing experi ence with a DO is not required, applicants who have shadowing experience with an osteopathic physician demonstrate commitment to the profession and understanding of the practice of osteopathic medicine. CUSOM welcomes additional letters of support or recommendation from those who are acquainted with the student's academic or professional ability. All additional letters of recommendation must be originals on professional or college/university letterhead, signed by the evaluator , and sent directly to the CU SOM Office of Admissions. 3.9 CUSOM Selection Process To be considered for an interview, each applicant must meet all the preceding admissions requirements and Technical Standards for admission and have a complete application file, including the AACOMAS application, a Secondary Application, proof of US Citize nship or Permanent US Residency (Passport , Green Card or Certificate of Naturalization), F1 student or other study -authorized nonimmigrant status, or recipients of Deferred Ac tion for Childhood Arrival (DACA) , a letter of recommendation from either an osteopathic or allopathic physician, a recommendation form/letter from a pre - medical or pre- health committee or science PhD faculty member and the processing fee or AACOMAS fee waiver . Addition al information ma y be required by CUSOM as necessary. After receipt of all of these materials, the applicant's file is reviewed by the Office of Admissions to determine eligibility for an interview based on criteria established by the CUSOM Admissions Committee. 31 The applicant will interview with members of the CUSOM faculty, staff , and administration. During the interview, the applicant's academic history and knowledge may be reviewed as well as the attributes which demonstrate the potential to become a caring an d compet ent osteop athic physicia n and fit for CUSOM 's Mission . At the conclusion of the int erviews, the int erviewers submit their re comm endation through WebAdMIT for review by the Dire ctor of Admissions, and these recomm endations are pres ented and discussed during an Admissions Committe e meeting. The Admissions Committee reviews each applicant who interviews with CUSOM and makes a recommendation of either \"accept\" or \"deny\" admission t o the Dean. The Dean, as the Chief Academic Officer, makes all final decisions on candidate status. The Dean decides to grant or deny acceptance of each candidate. This decision is provided to the applicant in a timely manner, by email notification typically within 2- 4 weeks of the interview date. Intentional misr epresentation or omission of infor mation on a ny form or records relev ant to admissions subje cts the applicant to a retra ction of an offer for admission, or dismiss al of the student in the c ase the misr epresentation/omission is discov ered after matriculation. CUSOM reserves the right to deny admission to any applicant for any lawful reason it deems appropriate. Matriculation may be denied to applicants who have failed to maintain a good record of scholastic performance or good record of personal conduct between the time of their acceptance a nd their m atriculation at CUSOM. In addition, re -admission may be denied to students returning from an approved L eave of Absence if they have failed to maintain a good record of scholastic performance or good record of personal conduct between the time of the beginning of their leave of absence and scheduled date of return. Inability to maintain complian ce with e ducational training te chnical stand ards, including required immunizations for healthcare workers, may a lso result in the revoc ation of a cceptance or matriculation. Addi tionally, applicants found to ha ve screening tests posit ive for alcohol, pres cription ch are illeg al in the state of North Carolina may result in revocation of an offer of a cceptan ce or dismissal from the program in the case positive tests are discovered after matriculation. Controlle d subst ance screening results a re view ed in light of North Carolina and fede ral la ws governing illegal substanc es. For example, although the use of mariju ana is leg al in some state s, the US Federal Drug Enforcement Ag ency lists it as an illeg al drug. Its use or a buse imp airs the a bility of a health care profe ssion al to provide optimal care to his or he r patients. As su ch, the use of ma rijuana in any form is a violation of Univ ersity policy. 32 3.10 Guaranteed Interview Process This i s onl y applicable to Campbell Unive rsity undergraduate stud ents wi th: A min and Overall GPA of 3.30 on a 4.0 scale. A minimum MCAT score at the 50th percentile with a preferred score in the 40th percentile or higher in Biological and Biochemical Founda tions of Living Systems (BBFLS).

Potential tr ansfer students must submit the following to the Office of Admissions: a completed CUSOM Application for Transfer form, certifi ed and of ficial tr anscripts from a ll post -second ary educational institutions, verifying passing grad es in a ll subj ects at the time of tr ansfer, and an overall 3.2 GPA or higher on a 4.0 s cale at th eir current medical school. Transfer stude nts le aving an a ccredited medi cal school must r equest a letter f rom both the D ean a nd one Asso ciate D ean from a ll prior medi cal schools attend ed. Transfer credit will be dependent on coursework compl eted by the applicant and will be subject to the fin al approval from the D ean based on the re comm endation of an ad hoc subcommittee of the CUSOM Admissions Committee. Students who h ave compl eted two ye ars of c ourse wo rk at another medi cal school will not be c onsid ered if they ha ve not pa ssed COMLEX -USA L evel 1. Credits will only be transf erred from COMs accredited by the Am erican Ost eopathic Asso ciation's Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation (COCA) or from schools of medicine accredited by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME). An ad hoc committee appointed by the Dean conducts an evaluation of courses for transfer . Students tr ansferring from a nother medi cal school to CUSOM will be requir ed to compl ete at least the last two y ears at CUSOM prior to gradu ation. In addition, all transf er students must me et CUSOM's ost eopathic manipulative me dicine training requir ements, rstanding osteopa thic philosophy prior to gradu ation. E ach transfer applicant's materials will be review ed by the Admissions Commi ttee, and the applicant will be intervi ewed prior to the approval of a transf er. CUSOM h as the right to require additional courses to be taken or clinical rotations added if deemed necessary to ensure the graduates are of the highe st qu ality and contribute to CUSOM su ccessfully meeting its Mission . The D ean termines s atisfactory compl etion of these requir ements. Students must fulf requirements for gr including pa ssing COMLEX -USA -USA Level 2 -PE licensing examinations, to re ceive the DO degr ee from CUSOM. As of the date of this Bulletin, the National Board of Osteopathic Medical Examiners (NBOME) and the COCA have temporarily waived the passing of COMLEX -USA Level 2 -PE as a graduation requirement for the Class of 2022. As such, to be eligible to graduate, each student must pass a summative O bjective Structured Clinical Examination ( OSCE ) administered by CUSOM. 34 3.13 Transfers from Accredited Schools of Med icine Credits are only transferrable from COMs accr edited by the Am erican Ost eopathic (COCA) , or fr om schools of medi cine accredited by Commi ttee on Edu cation tr ansfer must ha ve compl eted all course wo rk with pa ssing grades at the time of the transfer request a nd have at least a 3.2 or greater G PA on a 4.0 scale.

LCME tr students ement for osteopa thic manipulative medic ine including the demonstration of the requisite knowl edge and application of osteopa thic philosophy prior to gr aduation. The Dean, as the Chief Academic Officer, makes all final decisions on transfer requests. 3.14 International Student Applicants CUSOM may accept students who are US -born citizens, naturalized citizens, and green card holders , an F1 student or other study -authorized nonimmigrant status, or recipients of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival (DACA) . Applicants need to understand that for intern ship and residency training sites, clearance for the permission to participate in clinical training is determined by the site, not CUSOM. Certain sites have more time - consuming clearance processes, such as Vet erans Administration hospitals and other federal facilities. CUSOM cannot guarantee clearance for the permission to participate in clinical training at a specific site but will work to place students at the necessary sites to complete their educational requirements. CUSOM policy requires applicants who have completed coursework at foreign institutions be evaluated for U.S. equivalence by one of the evaluation services listed on the AACOM website: https://choosedo.org The evaluation service must verify course work completed at an institution outside of the US is comparable to a regionally -accredited US college or university in a course -by- course fashion. CUSOM does not a ccept transfer students from international m edical s chools. 35 3.15 Juris Do ctor and Doctor of Osteopathic Med icine (JD/DO) Dual Degree Program The Jerry M. Wallace School of Osteopathic Medicine and the Norman Adrian Wiggins School of Law offer a six -year combined program of study (JD/DO Dual Degree Program) leading to awarding of both the Juris Doctor (JD) degree and the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO) degree upon successful completion of all requirements. One significant benefit of the combined program is the opportunity for students to complete the program in six years, thereby reducing the amount of time it would otherwise take to earn these two degrees separately by one calendar year. Graduates will be poised to obtain significant positions of leadership, administration, and management and will be well equipped to serve as leaders in their professional and civic communities, working to make significant contributions at the intersection of law and medicin e. While Campbell JD/DO graduates will most likely practice in just one of the professions, their studies will provide them with exceptional insights into today's complex medico -legal issues. This program is rigorous and demanding and enrollment will be limited to those students meeting the criteria for both Campbell University School of Law and Campbell University School of Osteopathic Medicine Admissions Standards. Students admitted to the JD/DO program complete both degree s in six years , beginning their studies in the Campbell University School of Law. During the first year, the student would begin law school studies during the Summer Semester followed by law school classes in fall, spring , and summer semesters. During the second year of the combined program, the student would b egin medi cal studi es at C ampbell Univ chool of Ost eopathic M edicine and compl ete two years in medi cal studi es before returning to the law school. As a du al degree progr am, it is import ant to note that both the law s chool and the medi cal school a re ac credit ed. North Carolina has six American Bar Association ( ABA )-accredit ed law schools: 1. Campbell Duke ersity 3. Elon Unive North Ca rolina 5. Univ ersity of North Ca rolina Ch apel Hill 6. Wake Forest Uni versity 36 North Carolina has five Liaison Commi ttee on M edical Edu of North Ca (LCME-accredited) 5. Wake Forest Uni versity (LCME-accredited) CUSOM is the only osteopa thic medica l school in Nor th Carolina, and the JD/DO progr am is unique. In North C arolina, at the time of this Bulle tin only Duke University has a simil ar dual-degree progr am. In the United Stat es, the only other osteopa thic medi cal school with a simil ar joint d egree progr am is Row an Univ ersity in New J ersey. Applicants to the JD/DO Dual Degree program must first apply to both degree programs individually in the same academic year and meet all admission requirements outlined for both the Campbell University Juris Doctor (JD) and the Campbell University Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO) programs. The application deadline for the JD/DO Dual Degree program is November 15 . Applicants must be new applicants to and have accepted offers of admission from both degree programs to be eligible for review and acceptance into the JD/DO Dual Degree program. Acceptance into the JD and DO degree programs individually does not guarantee acceptance into the JD/DO Dual Degree program. The admissions process for the JD/DO Dual Degree program begins with applicants submitting a written request to both the law and medicine programs indicating their interest in pursuing and matriculating into the JD/DO Dual Degree program. Only applicants who were offered admission into the DO and the JD programs (in the same academic year), and who have formally accepted these offers, will be reviewed by the Dual Degree Program Committee for admission to the JD/DO Dual Degree program. Applicants will undergo an additional committee interview to discuss additional supplemental application materia l for the JD/DO Dual Degree program . Moreover, this interview will be open file and may include documents from the applicant's AACOMAS, Secondary Application, and additional s upplemental application materials for the DO school . 37 Combined JD/DO Degree Curriculum Overview Program Year School Credits (School) /Year Total Credits Earned (running totals) Summer LAW (1L) 5 credits (Law) 5 (Law) 1 LAW (1L) 31 credits (Law) 36 (Law) Summer LAW (1L) 8 credits (Law) 44 (Law) 2 MEDICINE (MS-1) --------------- LAW (2L) 49.5 credits (Medicine) --------------- 2 credits (Law) 49.5 (Medicine) --------------- 46 (Law) Summer LAW (2L) 8 credits (Law) 49.5 (Medicine) --------------- 54 (Law) 3 MEDIC INE (MS -2) --------------- LAW (2L) 42 credits (Medicine) --------------- 2 credits (Law) 91.5 (Medicine) --------------- 56 (Law) 4 LAW (3L) 30 credits (Law) 91.5 (Medicine) --------------- 86 (Law) 5 MEDICINE (MS -3) --------------- LAW (3L) 120 credits (Medicine) --------------- 2 credits (Law) 211.5 (Medicine) --------------- 88 (Law) 6 MEDICINE (MS -4) --------------- LAW (3L) 110 credits (Medicine) --------------- 2 credits (Law) 321.5 (Medicine) --------------- 90 (Law) JD and DO DEGREES CONFERRED Additional information concerning the JD/DO Dual Degree Program may be found at: https://law.campbell.edu/learn/academic -program/dual -degree -programs/ 3.16 Policies All a ccepted stude nts must meet the following requirements prior to matr iculation: 3.16.1 Health and Va ccination Requirements Accepting an offer of admission to CUSOM will require the incoming student to adhere to any mandates imposed by the University at a later date; acceptance of the offer of admission is indirect affirmation the incoming student both understands this point and accepts this as a condition of acceptance. Completion and verification of all vaccination requirements is required by July 1. Accepted students who have not completed all CUSOM vaccination requirements by July 1 prior to matriculation will have their offer of admission rescinded, will forfeit their seat in the class, and any deposit will not b e refunded. 38 All deposited CUSOM students are required to submit the following to the Office of Cl inical Affairs: 1. Compl eted medical history form 2. Proof of all CUSOM vaccination requirements - completed by July 1 3. Completed controlled substance screen (described below) 4. Completed physical examination conduc ted by a licensed physician Students must obtain all CUSOM -required vaccinations and corresponding titers, prior to matriculation and remain compliant with all vaccination requirements through graduation in order to complete all required supervised clinical practice experiences in the CUSOM curriculum. Regulatory and legislative authorities require students to demonstrate vaccination , immunity and/or protection from multiple contagious diseases before being allowed to participate in clinical experiences. CUSOM requires students to meet all vaccination requirements prior to matriculation and maintain compliance with these requirements through graduation. Descriptions of CU SOM vaccination requirements specifically addressing Diphtheria, Pertussis, Tetanus, Measles, Mumps, Rubella, Varicella, Hepatitis B, Influenza, and COVID -19 and testing for Tuberculosis are presented below. All incoming and current students must log all vaccination requirements on the standard AAMC Standard Immunization Form, available at: https://www.aamc.org/download/440110/data/immunizationform.pdf This form must be completed in its entirety and signed by a physician or qualified healthcare provider verifying the required information. In addition, students are required to submit supporting documentation such as vaccination records and titers. Important Notes Regarding Vaccination Requirements Completion and verification of all vaccine requirements is required by July 1. Entering MS -1 (first -year) students who have not completed all CUSOM vaccination requirements by July 1 prior to matriculatio n will have their offer of admission rescinded, will forfeit their seat in the class, and any deposit will not be refunded. Accepting an offer of admission to CUSOM will require the incoming student to adhere to any mandates imposed by the University at a later date; acceptance of the offer of admission is indirect affirmation the incoming student both understands this point and accepts this as a condition of acceptance. All students wishing to participate in patient care activities sponsored or affiliated with CUSOM must maintain full vaccination per this policy. Any incoming student needs to weigh these facts in considering acceptance of an offer of admission to CUSOM. 39 In addition, the influenza vaccine is required annually and before placement in a clini cal rotation. COVID -19 vaccination requirements will follow CDC guidelines or as specified by clinical education partners and may require boosters annually or at other designated intervals. o Clinical experiences are part of the core curriculum to obtain th e Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine degree, and, therefore, CUSOM does not waive vaccination or student health requirements for religious or personal preferences except as set forth herein. o Campbell University currently provides students the opportunity to request a medical or religious exemption for the COVID -19 vaccine through the following process: Students who seek a medical or relig ious exemption to the COVID -19 vaccination requirement should contact the Vice President for Student Life, who chairs the E xemption Review Panel, at 910- 893-1541 or vaxexemption@campbell.edu . o The granting of an exemption to the COVID -19 requirement, does not guarantee that a clinical training partner will honor the exemption. Campbell University cannot guarantee clinical placement for any student who does not comply with all vaccination requirements, even if the student has a religious or medical exemption granted by the University. o Campbell University does not have authority o r control over a clinical site's decisions. Therefore, an exemption granted under Campbell University's policies may not be applicable and accepted by a third -party clinical site. Even if a student is granted an exemption from vaccination requirements by the University, failure to provide proof of vaccinations for clinical experiences as required by external agencies may limit their clinical training opportunities and prevent or delay completion of academic requirements and graduation. Any expenses requi red by a clinical site for testing are the sole responsibility of the student. o If a student does receive an exemption, this does not create a prioritization in clinical placements. Standard placement processes will be utilized without consideration of waiver status. o If a student does not receive a clinical rotation placement as a result of an external clinical site's refusal to allow placement of a student who has not obtained all required vaccinations, the student will not be entitled to a refund of tuition or other relief from Campbell University. Students will not be allowed to participate in any patient care activities, including, but not limited to, early clinical experiences, activities with standardized patients, health outreach events, local, reg ional, national or international mission trips, and clinical rotations, until all vaccination requirements have been met. 40 Inability to participate in required clinical experiences due to noncompliance with CUSOM vaccination policies may result in unexcused absences leading to failure of a course, Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee hearing, Academic Probation, Suspension, delay in graduation, or even Dismissal from the program. Students must obtain all CUSOM -required vaccinations and corresponding titers prior to matriculation and remain compliant with all vaccination requirements through graduation in order to complete all required supervised clinical practice experiences in the CUSOM curriculum. In addition, non- compliance with CUSOM Vaccination Requirements may result in the inability to participate in any clinical experiences, including, but not limited to, standardized patient OSCEs, early clinical experiences, and clinical rotations. This may result in unexcused absences lea ding to failure of a course or clinical rotation(s), referral to the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee, Academic Probation, Suspension, delay in graduation, or even Dismissal from the program. All students must provide written documentation utilizing the AAMC Standardized Immunization Form: https://www.aamc.org/media/23441/download completed and signed by their healthcare provider or institutional representative verifyin g all CUSOM -required vaccination and titer requirements, as listed below, and in accordance with the CDC Guidelines (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/adults/rec -vac/hcw.html ), have been met f or the following: Diphtheria, Pertussis and Tetanus a. All students must submit documentation (physician signature or vaccination record) of vaccination with a *Tdap booster (Boostrix\u00ae or Adacel\u00ae) since the year 2005. i. *Tdap is the one -time booster containing the acellular pertussis vaccine and is available only in the Boostrix\u00ae or Adacel\u00ae vaccines. ii. Following the Tdap booster, a Td routine booster is required every ten (10) years. b. This information should be entered into the \"Tetanus -diphtheria - pertussis\" section of the AAMC 41 MMR: Measles (Rubeola), Mumps, and Rubella a. Students must provide dates and verification (physician signature or vaccination record) o f two (2) MMR vaccinations, occurring at least 28 days apart. i. If the student is able to provide a vaccination record or physician signature verifying the dates of these two (2) vaccinations, no titer will be required . b. Students unable to provide vaccination records or physician signat ure verifying completion of the MMR series have two (2) options: i. Repeat the MMR series o f two (2) vaccinations at least 28 days apart and provide documentation verifying completion of the series. ii. Obtain titers for measles, mumps, and rubella. 1. If a student elects to obtain titers and they show evidence of non - immunity to any of the three (3) components of the vaccine (measles, mumps, or rubella), they will be required to repeat the MMR series of two (2) vaccinations at least 28 days apart. The exception is if there is only non- immunity to Rubella, only one additional MMR vaccination will be required. c. This information should be entered into the \"MMR (Measles, Mumps, Rubella)\" section of the AAMC Standard Immunization Form. Varicella a. Students must provide antibody titers as evidence of immunity to Varicella. b. If antibody titers demonstrate a student is not immune to Varicella, they must receive two (2) doses of the varicella vaccine administered four (4) weeks apart. c. This information should be entered into the \"Varicella\" section of the AAMC Standard Immunization Form . Hepatitis B Vaccination a. Students must provide dates and verification ( physician signature or vaccination record) of completing a Hepatitis B vaccination series consisting of either: i. A three (3) dose series of either the Engerix -B or Recombivax HB. Injections of these vaccines are generally given at 0, 1, and 6 months which means injection two would be given 1 month following injection one, and injection three would be give n 6 months following injection one. ii. Two-dose series of Heplisav -B\u00ae with the doses separated by at least four (4) weeks. b. A quantitative antibody titer is then performed 4- 8 weeks following the final dose in the series. Qualitative results cannot be accepted. 42 c. While students may not have completed the entire series at the time of matriculation, all students must have at least received their first injection and be in the process of completing the subsequent injection(s) and titer following the above schedule. d. In addition, all students must provide verification of quantitative antibody titers demonstrating immunity to Hepatitis B. To ensure accuracy, it is recommended antibody titer testing be performed 4 -8 weeks following the final dose in the series. e. Students who do not demonstrate immunity through adequate titer levels i. Students who have received the initial series of Hepatitis B vaccine (3-doses if Engerix -B or Recombivax HB or 2- doses if Heplisav - B\u00ae) and do not seroconvert to demonstrate immunity will be required to repeat the complete series of vaccination s. ii. Following completion of the repeat series of Hepatitis B vaccinations, students must obtain another quantitative titer to confirm immunity. To ensure accuracy, it is recommended that antibody titer testing be performed 4 -8 weeks following the final dose in the series. iii. Students who still do not demonstrate immunity following the second Hepatitis B vaccination series will be considered a vaccine non-responder and at risk for acquiring Hepatitis B Virus (HB V). iv. Students who do not attain immunity following completion of a second Hepatitis B vaccination series will also be required to obtain testing for active Hepatitis B infection . Please see the information below under Hepatitis B testing for further details. f. If testing for Hepatitis B infection is negative, the student will be considered non-immune to Hepatitis B and will meet with the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs. Current recommendations and additional education on universal precautions, risk avoidance, and treatment options if exposed to HBV will be provided to the student. The student will sign documentation of informed consent to continue their education, acknowledging the medical risk and receipt of this information, but they will not be requir ed to continue additional HBV vaccination s. Hepatitis B Testing a. Per CDC guidelines, any student who does not obtain protective immunity as demonstrated by quantitative titers to Hepatitis B after a completion of two (2) vaccination series (for a total of six (6) vaccination s with either Engerix -B or Recombivax HB or a total of four (4) vaccination s with Heplisav -B\u00ae) will be required to obtain serologic testing for Hepatitis B infection as described below. Qualitative results cannot be accep ted. 43 b. Students who attain protective immunity to Hepatitis B after either the first or second vaccination series are considered immune, protected, and free of Hepatitis B and, therefore, do not require testing for the disease . c. Testing for Hepatitis B is acc omplished through evaluation of serum HBsAg (Hepatitis B Surface Antigen) and anti -HBc (Total Hepatitis B core antibody). i. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) is a protein on the surface of HBV; it can be detected in high levels in serum during acute or chronic HBV infection. The presence of HBsAg indicates the person is infectious. The body normally produces antibodies to HBsAg as part of the normal immune response to infection. HBsAg is the antigen used to make Hepatitis B vaccine. ii. Total Hepatitis B cor e antibody (anti -HBc) appears at the onset of symptoms in acute Hepatitis B and persists for life. The presence of anti-HBc indicates previous or ongoing infection with HBV of an undefined time frame. iii. Students who are required to obtain Hepatitis B testing must provide results of both HBsAg and anti -HBc to CUSOM along with the confirmatory lab reports. Students T esting P ositive for Hepatitis B a. Results of Hepatitis B testing will not affect a student's matriculation status or offer of acceptance but provide valuable information to ensure proper student and patient care safeguards and adherence to CDC recommendations for the management of Hepatitis B virus -infected healthcare providers and students are followed. In addition, testing prior to matriculation pr ovides documentation of baseline infection status in the event a student has an exposure incident during subsequent clinical activities. i. While the presence of a chronic disease does not affect admission to CUSOM, student participation in clinical training is subject to the policies of the affiliated private hospitals and other healthcare facilities where students train. b. As noted by the CDC guidelines, HBV infection alone does not disqualify infected persons from the practice or study of medicine. However, in order to promote and optimize both infected student and patient safety, CUSOM has adopted the following set of guidelines for students found to be infected with HBV. c. Students who test positive for Hepatitis B/show evidence of Chronic Active Hepatitis B will be required to have a complete evaluation by an Infectious Disease physician or Gastroenterologist to evaluate the student's clinical and viral burden status and make recommendations regarding treatment and any appropriate limitation to participation in specific procedures or patient care activities. The consulting physician should provide the following information to the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs: 44 i. A summary of the complete evaluation including any additional testing deemed appropriate to de fine and further evaluate the student's Hepatitis B infection and impact on their health. This should include, but is not limited to, HBV DNA levels (serve as a predictive indicator of infectivity). The CDC recommends that an HBV level 1,000 IU/ml (5,000 GE/ml) or its equivalent is an appropriate threshold for a reviewing physician or panel to adopt. ii. Details of any treatment are recommended. iii. A recommendation regarding the student's ability to participate in patient care including any restriction from specific procedures or patient care activities (Based on Category I or Category II Procedures). iv. Coordination with the student's primary care physician (PCP) for ongoing care and establishment of appropriate follow up which must include at least an annual e xam. v. Complete the CUSOM Hepatitis B Information Form (Appendix 1) documenting the above information and submit it to the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs. 1. The consultation must be completed and the CUSOM Hepatitis B Information Form received by the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs before the student is permitted to begin clinical rotations or participate in any other patient care activities, including , but not limited to , activities with standardized patients, the CUCCC, community medicine outreach activities, or medical mission trips. Students will not be able to participate in clinical rotations or other patient care activities until this is completed. 2. A student testing positive for Hepatitis B is required to complete a follow up visit with the consulting specialist (or primary care physician upon recommendation of the consulting specialist) once every 12 months or sooner based on the specialist's recomm endation. Additionally, another CUSOM Hepatitis B Information Form must be completed and submitted to the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs prior to the start of fourth - year clinical rotations. 3. Notification of Student Hepatitis B Status Per CDC guidelines, routine notification of patients regarding student HBV status is not indicated unless the provider exposes the patient to a bloodborne infection. To ensure HBV -infected students are following all institutional policies regarding the provision o f care by infected providers, the Director of Student Medical Education (DSME), or equivalent, and preceptor will be notified of the students HBV infection prior to the rotation as well as the recommendations of the consulting specialist 45 regarding any suggested restriction from patient care activities. 4. Modification of Plan of Study for Students with Chronic Hepatitis B Infection Students who are cleared by the evaluating specialist to participate in unrestricted patient care will have no modification of the ir clinical education or rotation experience unless mandated by their specific clinical site. Students who are restricted from performing specific clinical procedures (Category I) by the evaluating specialist or clinical site may have their educational cur riculum or rotation experience modified as needed. This may include the substitution of simulation- based aids or cadaveric models to provide equivalent procedural experiences. Any requirement to modify student procedural experiences based on consultant or clinical site recommendations will not adversely affect a student's grade as the student will be evaluated utilizing one of the alternative methods noted above. The choice for alternative educational/procedural experiences will be determined in consultati on with the discipline clinical chairs, discipline preceptors, and regional deans/DSMEs on each campus. 5. Additional Guidelines and information regarding students with Chronic Hepatitis B Infection Standard Precautions All students, including those with HBV infection, must maintain strict adherence to the tenants to standard (universal) infection control precautions. Students with HBV infection are encouraged to practice double -gloving, especially when participating in highly exposure -prone procedures, as thi s intervention has been shown to be efficacious in preventing the spread of HBV infections. Exposure -prone Procedures In general, exposure -prone procedures include those in which access for surgery is difficult, or those in which needle stick injuries are likely to occur, typically in very closed and non- visualized operating spaces in which double -gloving and the skin integrity of the operator might be compromised. Given the variety of procedures, practices, and providers, each HBV -infected healthcare provi der performing a potentially exposure -prone procedure will need individual consideration. This will include a recommendation from an Infectious Disease specialist or 46 Gastroenterologist who has evaluated the student along with guidance provided by individual hospital, healthcare system, and/or preceptor policies. Categorization of Clinical Procedures Category I Procedures a. Those known or likely to pose an increased risk of percutaneous injury to a healthcare provider that have resulted in provider -to-patient transmission of HBV. b. Are generally limited to: i. Major abdominal, cardiothoracic, and orthopedic surgery; ii. Repair of major traumatic injuries; iii. Abdominal and vaginal hysterectomy; iv. Caesarean section; v. Vaginal deliveries; or vi. Major oral or maxillofacial surgery. c. Techniques that have been demonstrated to increase the risk for healthcare provider percutaneous injury and provider -to-patient blood exposure include: i. Digital palpation of a needle tip in a body cavity; or ii. The simultaneous presence of a healthcare provide r's fingers and a needle or other sharp instrument or object (bone spicule) in a poorly visualized or highly confined anatomic site. d. Students with HBV infection may be restricted from performing Category I procedures based on recommendations from an Infect ious Disease specialist or based on hospital or preceptor policy. Category II Procedures a. All other invasive and noninvasive procedures. b. Pose low or no risk for percutaneous injury to a healthcare provider or, if a percutaneous injury occurs, it usually happens outside a patient's body and generally does not pose a risk for provider -to- patient blood exposure. c. Procedures include the following: i. Surgical and obstetrical procedures that do not involve the techniques listed for Category I; ii. The use of needles o r other sharp devices when the healthcare provider's hands are outside a body cavity (e.g., phlebotomy, placing and maintaining peripheral and central intravascular lines, administering medication by injection, performing needle biopsies, or lumbar punctur e); 47 iii. Dental procedures other than major oral or maxillofacial surgery; iv. Insertion of tubes (e.g., catheters); v. Endoscopic or bronchoscopic procedures; vi. Internal examination with a gloved hand that does not involve the use of sharp devices (e.g., vaginal, oral, and rectal exam); or vii. Procedures that involve external physical touch (e.g., general physical or eye examinations or blood pressure checks). d. Students with HBV infection are generally not restricted from perform ing Category II procedures. Tuberculosis (TB) Testing a. Baseline TB screening/testing is required for all medical students prior to matriculation and again prior to each year of clinical rotations. b. There are two (2) acceptable methods for TB screening, and all students must provide documentation of the results from ONE of the two methods : i. Two-step tuberculin skin test (TST); or ii. Interferon -Gamma (IGRA) blood test TB Gold In -Tube Test or T -spot TB Test). If the initial TB screening is done with the Tuberculin Skin Test (TST), the student must have the Two -Step Method at baseline (described below) followed by a single -step annually . If the blood test (Interferon -Gamma Release Assay or IGRA) is used at initial screening for baseline measures, a two -step process is not required. Students should speak with their physician to determine which test is most appropriate for them. c. Option 1: The Mantoux tuberculin skin test (TST) i. The Mantoux TST is the standard method of determining whether a person has been exposed to Mycobacterium tuberculosis . The TST is performed by injecting 0.1 ml of tuberculin purified protein derivative (PPD) into the anterior surface of the forearm. The skin test reaction should be read between 48 and 72 hours after administration. If the test is not read between 48 and 72 hours after being placed, the student will need to be rescheduled for another skin test. 1. Two -Step Method: If TST is utilized as the TB screening test, the \"two -step method\" is required . 48 ii. Test interpretation 1. If the first TST result in the two -step baseline testing is positive, the person is considered infected and should be evaluated and treated accordingly. 2. If the first test result is negative, the TST should be repeated in 1-3 weeks . 3. If the second test result is positive, the person is considered infected and should be evaluated and treated accordingly. 4. If both steps are negative, the person is considered uninfected, and classify the TST as negative at baseline testing. iii. Note: Two -step Method is only used at the initial screening for a baseline measure - annual testing thereafter only requires a single PPD. iv. When IGRAs are used for testing, there is no need for a second test. v. Summary of 2 -step TST testing is provided in the following table: 1st TST Test Negative Repeat TST in 1 -3 weeks Positive Considered positive for infection* 2nd TST Test Negative Person probably does not have an infection Single PPD required annually moving forward Positive Considered positive for infection* * It is recommended that any student who has received bacille Calmette -Gu\u00e9rin (BCG), a vaccine for TB disease, undergo IGRA, rather than TST testing. If a student who has previously received BCG undergoes TST testing and obtains a positive result, they should be tested using an IGRA . d. Option 2: Interferon -Gamma Release Assays (IGRAs) blood test i. TB blood tests (interferon- gamma release assays or IGRAs) measure how the immune system reacts to the bacteria that cause TB. Two IGRAs are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and are available in the United States: 1. QuantiFERON\u00ae-TB Gold In -Tube test (QFT -GIT) 2. T-SPOT\u00ae.TB test (T -Spot) ii. IGRAs are the preferred method of TB infection test ing for anyone who has received bacille Calmette- Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) . BCG is a vaccine disease. iii. Results of IGRAs 1. Positive IGRA : This means that the person has been infected with TB bacteria. Additional tests, including a chest X -ray, are needed to deter mine if the person has latent TB infection or active TB disease. 2. Negative IGRA : This means that the person's blood did not react to the test, and that latent TB infection or TB disease is not likely. 49 e. Special Situations - Prior BCG Vaccination and Pregnancy i. Testing for TB in BCG -Vaccinated Persons : 1. Many people born outside of the United States have been BCG - vaccinated. People who have had a previous BCG vaccine may receive a TB skin test. In some people, BCG may cause a positive skin test when the y are not infected with TB bacteria. If a TB skin test is positive, additional tests are needed. IGRAs, unlike the TB skin tests, are not affected by prior BCG vaccination and are not expected to give a false- positive result in people who have received B CG. 2. Students who have had a previous BCG vaccine must still be tested for TB with the TST or IGRAs . 3. Most people with previous BCG vaccine should consider an IGRA rather than a TST test; however, that decision should be made in consultation with their healthcare provider. ii. Pregnancy 1. Pregnancy is not a contraindication for TB skin testing. Pregnant students and students who are nursing should be included in the same baseline and serial TB screening as all other healthcare workers . IGRA blood tests are not currently used in pregnant women. iii. Medical Students with Positive TST or IGRA Testing 1. Students with WRITTEN documentation of a previous positive TST or TB Blood Test 2. If the date and result of the previous test are documented, these students do not need a repeat TST or TB blood test. 3. If they have written documentation of the results of a chest X - ray indicating no active TB disease that is dated after the date of the positive TST or TB blood result, they do not need another chest X -ray unless symptom s or signs of TB disease develop or a clinician recommends a repeat chest X -ray. 4. These students do not require annual TST or IGRA testing but must complete the TB Risk Assessment Form (Appendix 2) annually , have it signed by a physician, and return it to t he Office of Clinical Affairs. 5. If the student does not have written documentation of a chest radiograph, they must obtain a chest X -ray prior to matriculation to exclude a diagnosis of infectious TB. The results/interpretation of this chest X -ray must be submitted to the Office of Clinical Affairs. iv. Medical Students with a Newly Identified positive TST or IGRA blood test 1. If a student tests positive with either screening test (TST or IGRA) any time following matriculation, they must immediately notify the Director of Student Affairs. 50 2. These individuals must be assessed by their physician for current TB symptoms and risk factors for pro gression to active TB disease. The physician must complete the \"Record of Tuberculosis Screening\" form and provide documentation indicating that the student is permitted to con tinue in the curriculum as a medical student including participation in lectures , labs, and clinical rotations. This documentation, along with documentation of the students chest x -ray result as noted below, must be submitted to the Office of Clinical Aff airs prior to the student returning to campus or participating in any clinical rotation experiences. 3. In addition, they must obtain a chest X -ray to exclude a diagnosis of active infectious TB disease and submit this documentation to the Office of Clinical Affairs. v. Medical Students with Suspected or Confirmed Infectious TB 1. If infectious TB is confirmed, the student must not return to campus or participate in any third - or fourth- year clinical rotations or other clinical activities, including, but not limited to, the CUCCC, community outreach, or medical mission trips. A student confirmed to have infectious TB will only be able to return when all the following criteria have been met: Three consecutive sputum samples collected in 8 -24 hour intervals are negative with at least one sample from an early morning specimen; The person has responded to anti -TB tre atment that will likely be effective (based on susceptibility results); The person is determined to be noninfectious by a physician knowledgeable and experienced in managing active TB disease; and 2. The student's treating physician must provide documentation to the Office of Clinical Affairs verifying each of these criteria have been met and that the student can safely participate in clinical rotations. f. All required information regarding TB testing and treatment must be entered in the \"Tuberculin Screening History\" section of the AAMC Standard Immunization form . Influenza a. All students are required to provide the dates and verification (physician signature or vaccination record) of an annual influenza vaccination. b. Students will be required to resubmit verification annually and will not be allowed to participate in patient care activities without proof of vaccination. 51 COVID -19 Unless granted an exemption as set forth below, Campbell University policy requires all students enrolled in a healthcare program to be fully vaccinated against COVID -19. Due to the rapidly evolving nature of this disease, the requirements listed below are subject to change to be consistent with recognized safe practices. To be considered fully vaccinated, students must have received the second dose in a 2- dose series, such as the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines, at least 2 weeks prior to arriving/returning to campus or received a single -dose vaccine, such as the Johnson & Johnson's Janssen vaccine, at least two weeks prior to arriving/returning to campus. The criteria for being considered fully vaccinated may change at any time based on CDC guidelines. COVID -19 vaccination requirements will follow CDC guidelines or as specified by clinical education partners and may require boosters annually or at other designated intervals. Completion and verification of all vaccine requirements is required by July 1. Clinical experiences are part of the core curriculum to obtain the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine degree, and, therefore, CUSOM does not waive vaccination or student health requirements for rel igious or personal preferences. Campbell University currently provides students the opportunity to request a medical or religious exemption for the COVID -19 vaccine through the following process: o Students w ho seek a medical or religious exemption to the COVID - 19 vaccination requirement should contact the Vice President for Student Life, who chairs the Exemption Review Panel, at 910- 893- 1541 or vaxexemption@cam pbell.edu . COVID Testing Requirements for Unvaccinated Students Any CUSOM DO student who is not fully vaccinated against COVID -19 due to having received an exemption to the COVID -19 vaccination requirement by the university will be required to undergo weekly COVID testing . The established timing, location, and specific instructions for the required weekly COVID -19 testing will be provided in writing to all unvaccinated medical students. o For the 2021- 2022 academic year, all medical students who are not fully vaccinated are required to undergo COVID testing on Monday mornings before classes begin. o For the 2021- 2022 academic year, all testing will be conducted at the COVID -19 testing center located on Judge Taylor Road, just across the street from the Campbell University Health Center. For the 2021- 2022 academic year COVID testing is as follows: o First year DO students: Testing begins at 7:00AM and must be completed by 7:30AM. 52 o Second year DO students: Testing begins at 7:30AM and must be completed by 8:00AM. o Please note the day/times may change. All students will need to remain at the testing site until they receive their results. o If a student's test is positive for COVID, they are instructed NOT to come on campus and will be referred to the Campbell University Health Center (910 -893-1560) for further guidance and evaluation as appropriate. o Any student whose test is positive for COVID must isolate for at least 5 days with at least 24 hours symptom/fever free without the aid of ibuprofen, Tylenol or fever reducers unless directed otherwise by a health professional. Optional Vaccines and Testing HIV Testing Although not required, CUSOM encourages all students to obtain HIV testing prior to matriculation . Testing prior to matriculation provides students with their baseline status in regard to the presence of HIV infection which is valuable in the event a student has an exposure incident during subsequent clinical activities. Students are not required to report the results of their testing to CUSOM. Hepatitis C Testing To protect CUSOM students and patients, it is recommended that students obtain Hepatitis C testing and provide documentation of test results to the Office of Clinical Affairs prior to matriculation . Results of Hepatitis C testing will not affect a student's matriculation status or offer of acceptance but will provide valuable information to ensure proper patient care safeguards and adherence to CDC recommendations for the management of Hepat itis C virus in infected healthcare providers and students are followed. In addition, testing prior to matriculation provides a baseline status in regard to the presence of Hepatitis C infection which is valuable in the event a student has an exposure inc ident during subsequent clinical activities. Testing for Hepatitis C may be accomplished by several methods with the most common method utilized for initial screening being the measurement of anti -HCV, which is a test to detect the presence of antibodies t o the Hepatitis C virus. 53 If anti -HCV tests are positive, students will be required to obtain additional confirmatory testing and medical follow up in accordance with CDC guidelines: http://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/HCV/HCVfaq.htm#section3 Optional Vaccines The following vaccines are considered optional; however, CUSOM strongly advises all students to dis cuss the appropriateness of each of the following vaccinations with their primary care physician, taking into account their personal medical history, risk factors for contracting these diseases and potential for international travel. 1. Polio 2. Hepatitis A 3. Meni ngococcal Disease 4. Yellow Fever 5. Typhoid Fever Students who have obtained the above optional vaccinations should document the dates and provide verification (physician signature or vaccination records) and include them in the \"Additional Vaccines\" section of the AAMC Standard Immunization Form. Additional Information Regarding Immunization Requirements In some situations, clinical training sites may have additional vaccination requirements above those required by CUSOM. CUSOM does not waive vaccination or student health requirements for religious, medical, or personal preferences. CUSOM may revise the vaccination requirements at any time as deemed necessary, and all students will be required to comply with any subsequent changes. 3.16.2 National Background Checks If an applicant has been convicted of a misdemeanor or felony prior to admission or matriculation, it is their responsibility to inform CUSOM immediately . Failure to disclose and provide accurate information about prior convictions may result in annulment of acceptance offers, program dismissal, or other sanctions. Applicants must b e aware of the potential impact on program acceptance and contact CUSOM for advice if they have a felony conviction or a criminal record. I f an applicant is uncertain of the status of a charge versus a conviction on their record, or if they are uncertain as to whether the offense was an infraction, misdemeanor, or a felony, they should contact the city, county, or state jurisdiction where the incident occurred , and they should contact CUSOM . 54 Note that applicants should only provide information regarding crimes for which they were convicted, or to which they entered a plea of guilty or no contest. Applicants should not include information regarding any of the following: Any instance in which they were arrested but which did not result in a conviction; Any instance in which they were convicted of a crime but the conviction was overturned on appeal ; Any instance in which they were convicted of a crime but received a pardon; Any instance in which they were tried as a juvenile or in which the conviction was entered via a court process specific to juvenile defendants ; or Any instance in which they were convicted of a crime but th e conviction has since been expunged or sealed by a court under applicable law CUSOM applicants are required to self -disclose any charges, arrests or convictions including misdemeanors, felonies, a prayer for judgment continued, deferred adjudications, tr affic violations, military non -judicial punishment, court martial, and general or less -than-honorable discharge from the military, (all hereinafter \"Offenses\") with the understanding that non- disclosure/falsification of any previous or pending Offenses may result in the revocation of the offer of admission. If a student has any Offenses pending final adjudication at any time during the application process, at the time of matriculation, or following matriculation , it is the student's responsibility to immediately inform CUSOM. Additionally, in response to requirements in the professional practice environment and to minimize the risk to patients, a background check will be completed on all accepted applicants prior to matriculation, and on any student whose actions could potentially be considered a risk to others at any time. Should any Offenses occur after matriculation, (1) the student must report the Offenses to the Executive Director of Student Affairs within thirty (30) days of the incident, or (2) if Offenses occurring prior to matriculation are not reported to CUSOM at the time of application but are subsequently discovered following matriculation, the Offense will be reviewed pursuant to Section 6.7.5 of thi s Bulletin . A national background check can be done at any time and is also done on each student prior to the start of clinical rotations . Students must be aware that results may be requested by the clinical sites and will be provided if requested . By matriculating to CUSOM, the student agrees to allow CUSOM to share background check information in full with the student's respective clinical site(s) . 55 Additional national background checks may be performed at the discretion of CUSOM or its partnering institutions before accepting a student into a clinical rotation. National background checks may be required at any time deemed appropriate by CUSOM. Discovery of any previously non- reported Offense(s) may lead to referral to the Academic Performance, Pr omotion and Standards (APPS) Committee and possible sanctions, up to, and including, dismissal from the program. CUSOM has no control over the content of third- party background checks. Even expunged records may appear on these background checks. Background checks revealing prior Offenses, even charges which may have been dismissed by the courts, could still result in consequences affecting clinical rotations, acceptance into residency programs, future licensing, specialty board certification, or employment opportunities. If a student is unable to complete clinical rotations due to the inability to pass background check requirements, they will not be capable of making academic progress or be able to meet graduation requirements. In addition, and a s such, they will be referred to the APPS committee for possible sanctions, up to, and including, dismissal from the program. A student with any Offenses is encouraged to contact the licensure boards in the state of intended practice to ensure the aforeme ntioned Offense will not inhibit the ability to obtain a medical license upon graduation. All current or former students returning from an approved extended period away from CUSOM, such as a Leave of Absence or an offer to repeat an academic year, must no tify CUSOM in writing of any Offenses, including any conduct which may be considered a violation of the Standards of Professional Conduct (Section 5.6.3), Student Professionalism and Ethics Standards (Section 6.7.2) , Honor Code (Section 6.7.3), or the Code of Misconduct (Section 6.7.4) at least sixty (60) days prior to the anticipated return date. An Offense occurring less than sixty (60) days prior to the anticipated return date must be reported to the Executive Director of Student Affairs within 24 hours of the Offense. Non- disclosure or falsification of any information related to an Offense may result in the revocation of the offer to return to CUSOM, or if already returned to CUSOM, referral to the APPS Committee for possible sanctions up to, and including, dismissal from the program. CUSOM retains the right to relinquish the seat of any current or former student returning from an extended absence if they have been criminally charged or convicted of a misdemeanor, felony, or traffic violation. Students who have already resumed classes following an extended absence, who have been or are criminally charged or convicted of a misdemeanor, felony, or traffic violation 56 will be referred to the APPS Committee for sanctions up to, and including, dismissal from the program. As future physicians, students are held to a high standard of professionalism, ethics , and honor, and CUSOM has a duty to protect the public from potential harm by its students. All current or former students returning from a n approved period away from CUSOM including, but not limited to, a Leave of Absence or an offer to repeat an academic year, minimally must submit a completed Secondary Application, national background check, and controlled substance screen within a timefra me designated by CUSOM , but no later than sixty (60) days prior to the anticipated return date. Additional requirements, such as a psychiatric or medical evaluation, may be placed on returning students as deemed appropriate. Students who do not return on the approved date, or otherwise do not fulfill all of the requirements for return yet still wish to attend CUSOM , will have to re - apply through AACOMAS and will not be guaranteed re -admission. 3.16.3 Driver's Li cense As the clinical campus system of CUSOM is widespread across the states of North and South Carolina, all applicants must provide evidence of a valid driver's license to allow for travel to clinical rotations. Students may have to drive up to an hour from the premier educational partner of their respective regional site for an assigned rotation. Therefore, evidence of a valid driver's license must be provided to the Office of Student Affairs by the end of the first year of medical school. Failure to provide evidence of this item by the en d of the first year of medical school may prevent the student from being promoted to the second year of medical school. 3.16.4 Basic Li fe Support Skills CUSOM students are required to have Basic Life Support (BLS) training prior to matriculation and must maintain active certification through graduation. Each student must provide a copy of their American Heart Association CPR card, documenting current BLS for Healthcare Providers certification . CUSOM only accepts BLS for Healthcare Provider courses autho rized by the American Heart Association. Failure to provide evidence of appropriate certification may result in revocation of an offer of acceptance. BLS certification must be maintained throughout your enrollment at CUSOM. 57 3.16.5 Controlled Substance Screening In response to requirements in the professional practice environment and to minimize the risk to patients, a controlled substance screening must be completed by all accepted applicants prior to matriculation. This screening must meet CUSOM's standards and be conducted by an agency approved by CUSOM. Controlled substance screening results are viewed in light of state and federal laws governing illegal or controlled substances. If the controlled substance screening test result is positive (i.e. evidence of a controlled substance) or shows other abnormalities including, but not limited, to excessively diluted urine, an ad hoc committee will be assigned to review the case . Dependi ng on the recommendation of the ad hoc committee, the student's acceptance may be rescinded. For example, although the use of marijuana is legal in some states, the US Federal Drug Enforcement Agency lists it as an illegal drug. Its use or abuse impairs the ability of a healthcare professional to provide optimal care to his or her patients. As such, the use of marijuana in any form is a violation of University policy. By signing the Attestation confirming that students have read and acknowledge complian ce with the precepts contained in the CUSOM Academic Bulletin, each applicant to CUSOM attests he/she is not currently using, and he/she will not use while a CUSOM student, any products or substances in any manner which are illegal in the state of North Ca rolina. A random controlled substance screening is required prior to starting clinical rotations, and all results are shared with the clinical sites. Additional screenings may be required, at any time, at the discretion of CUSOM or partnering - institution s. By matriculating to CUSOM, the student agrees t o allow CUSOM to share controlled substance screening results as deemed necessary. If either of the following events occur, the matter will be referred to the APPS Committee for review in accordance with Section 6.7.5 of this Bulletin: 1. Any substance-related incident which occurs before or after matriculation, including , but not limited to, charges/arrests for Driving Under the Influence, must be reported by the student to the CUSOM Office of Student Affairs within thirty (30) days of the o ccurrence. 2. If the controlled substance screening test result is positive (i.e. evidence of a controlled substance) or shows other abnormalities including, but not limited, to excessively diluted urine 58 3.16.6 Transcripts All CUSOM students are requir ed to provide official tr anscripts f rom all colleges and unive rsities attended if they ha ve course work which was not includ ed or degree(s) not conferred with the transcripts submitted through AACOMAS. All transcripts are included in the student's original AACOMAS application so students are only required to provide CUSOM official transcripts from coursework completed and degree(s) conferred after the AACOMAS application was submitted. All students must submit all requir ed paperwork by the publishe d deadlin es. Failure to submit infor mation could r esult in a n offer of admission b eing rescinded. Falsifica tion of a ny doc ument or omission of any p ertinent information may result in dismiss al from the program if dis covered after matriculation. 59 4. Student Expenses and Financial Aid 4.1 Cost of Attendance 4.1.1 Secondary Application Fee A non-refunda ble fee of $50.00 is payable upon submission of the Seconda ry Application for admission. D etails regarding fee submis sion are include d in the email invitation to submit a Seconda ry Application. CUSOM will waive this fee if the a pplicant has a n approve d AACOM AS fee waiver documen t. 4.1.2 Accep tance Fee Accepted students must submit a non- refundable fee of $1,500.00 to CUSOM by the deadline designated in their offer of acceptance. Payment is c redited toward tuition upon mat riculation. 4.1.3 Tuition and Fees Tuition is subject to chang e annua lly. Tuit ion for the 2021- 2022 Acade mic Year is $55,150 with additional fees of $2,000 to cover recreation, technology , and other needs. C ampbell Univ ersity's Board of Trustees reserves the right to chang e the schedule of tu ition and fees without advance notice, and to ma ke such change s applicable to pre sent, as well as future students of CUSOM. The Board of Trustees may also establish additional fees or charges for special services w henever, in the Board of Trustee's opinion, such act ions are deemed advisabl e. Students receiv ing federal aid or scholarships which have not arrived by the beginnin g of the acade mic year must have written assurance the funds are awarded. S tudents must pay any outs tanding tuition and fees. When those funds are distribut ed, any funds which exceed tuition and fees will be refunded.

The financial aid program assists students in the fo rm of ins titutional scholarships and student loans. The Office provide s financial aid couns eling to prospective applicants and to CUSOM graduates and bey ond. The CUSOM Office of Financial Aid is respons ible for the administration of the student financial aid program. Financial aid couns eling is provide d to all prospect ive students as part of the applicant interview process. During each applicant interview session, a financial aid couns elor provid es a fin ancial aid presentation. aid couns eling is also a vailable to stude nts b y appointment. The O ffice of Financial Aid will email all accep ted students information related to applying for financial aid. Students interested in applying for financial aid are required to comple te the Fre e Applic ation for Fe deral Student Aid (FAFSA), and the Statement of Financial Responsibility. Students must also provide any other document ation required by federal, state, and private financial assistance programs to determine eligibility for student financial assistance. Financial aid couns eling is presented to incomin g students at the Financial Aid Entrance Interview Presentatio n during O rientation. Attendance at this financial aid presentation is mandatory for all students. During the presentation , feder al entrance couns eling requirements are discussed including eligibilit y calcul ations, borro wer rights and responsibilitie s, and loan informatio n. A review of the financial aid applicatio n process , loan disburse ments, billing proces s, deferments, recor d keeping , and debt manage ment are also discussed.

Weekly schedules vary based on course content and space needs but are gene rally stru ctured so that lectures prim arily take place in the morn ing with labs and clinical skills typical ly taking place in the a fternoons. Lectures and discuss ions are comple ment ed by labs and clinical skills sessions with embedde d study time. OMM and other clinical skills are taught longitudinal ly thro ughout the fi rst two years in a progression designed to integra te with and provi de a s eamless transition to the third and fourth years. Content is presented by biomedical faculty and phy sicians incorporating te am- teaching and small group learning. For years three and four , clinical rotations are typically four ( 4) wee ks in dur ation at the Regional Clinical sites. Learning assessment during the first 8 Blocks of years one and two includ es integrated exams, quizzes , OS CE, clinical skills, anatomy, OMM practical exams, and end-of-year evaluations. Weekl y clinical case exercises help students integrate and apply knowledge acquired during the week and provide faculty opportunities for monitoring students' learning progress. For years three and four, student evaluation is performed by clinical preceptors at the end of each clinical rotation, and similarly students evaluate each clinical rotation to identify curricular improv ement opportunities . The minimum length of the osteopathic medical curriculum at CUSOM is 167 weeks over four academic years. The curriculum duration for each year is: Year 1 = 37 weeks Year 2 = 38 weeks Year 3 = 48 weeks Year 4 = 44 weeks 5.1.2 Programmatic Level Educational Outcome Objectives CUSOM has adopted the 2012 American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine ( AACOM) Osteopathic Core Competencies for Medical Students as the programmatic level educational outcome objectives for graduates since these also align with the mission of the university and medical school. 70 These Osteopathic Core Competencies measure specific objectives along the following 14 competency domains: 1. Osteop athic Principles and Practices 2. Medical Knowledge 3. Patient Care 4. Interpe rsonal and Communication Skills 5. Professionalism 6. Practice- Based Learning and Improvement 7. Systems -Based Practice 8. Counseling for Health Promotion/Disease Prevention 9. Cultural Competencies 10. Evaluation of Health Sciences Literature 11. Environmental and Occupational Medicine (OEM) 12. Public Health Systems 13. Global Health 14. Interprofessional Collaboration The four -year Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine curriculum, which embodies the mind, body, spirit philosophy of the osteopathic profession and M ission of Campbell University, is a systems -based curriculum consistent with many medical schools in the United States. The four -year course of study begins with integrated biomedical and clinical didactic and laboratory activities leading up to the third- and fourth- year clinical rotations , which provide the necessary clinical training for transition to , and success in , subsequent residency programs. For the full description and detailed listing of objectives, please refer to the official 2012 document published by AACOM linked here . 5.1.3 Clinical Shadowing Policies and Procedur es CUSOM M edical Student Shadowing Many students choos e to engag e in clinical shadowing experiences during breaks in the fo rmal CUSOM curriculum such as Block breaks, summer break, or weekends. S hadowing experiences can be extremely valuable , and students may choos e to include these ex periences in their curriculum vitae, personal statement or Medical Student Performance Evaluation (MSPE). S hadowing experiences can occur with CUSOM -appointe d clinical faculty memb ers or phy sicians not a ffiliate d with C USOM . It is essential that stude nts choosing to engage in shadowi ng experiences unde rstand the differences between these optional sh adowing experiences and the requir ed clinical rotations of the credit -bearing CUSOM curriculum. Shadowing experiences do not occur as part of the stude nt's required CUSOM curriculum and m ay lack the d efined stru cture, supe rvision, feedback mechanisms, and medi cal-legal protections provide d by formal clinical rotations. 71 Students choosing to engage in a shadowi ng experience ackno wledge they will do so while a dhering to the following principles: 1. Shadowing experiences are meant to be observational only and if any hands -on activity occurs with patients, it should be limited to patient examination, approved by the patient and supervising physician, and MUST be repeated by the physician. To protect patients and students, students are not to perform any invasive procedures while on shadowing experiences, including but not limited to suturing, endotracheal intubation, performing arterial blood gas testing, or placing IV's, Foley catheters, or central lines or perform exams of the pelvic, breast, rectal and genitourinary systems. Students should not perform any osteopathic manipulation while on shadowing experiences. 2. Students are not protected by malp ractice insurance provided by Campbe ll Un iversity while engaged in physician sha dowing experiences unless the experience is with a CUSOM-appointed faculty memb er and as a part of the curriculum . S tudents are required to let non- CUSOM ap pointed physicians they are shadowing know that th ey are not covered by malp ractice insurance provide d by Campbell University. 3. Students must follow all hospital system, facility, and ambul atory policies when engaging in any type of shadowing experience. Individual physicians chosen to shadow with may not be familiar with their facility or healthcare system pol icies so it is the student's respons ibility to make sure they review and compl y with a ny applicable pol icies. 4. Indivi dual physicians may not know the student's level of training and it is the refore the student's e thical and pr ofessional dut y to fully explain their lev el of tr aining. Shadowing with CUSOM Cl inical F aculty M embers 1. Students who desire to shadow CUS OM clinical faculty must arrange the e xperience on their own. 2. Students shadowing with CUSOM clinical faculty memb ers should wear their CUSOM n ame badge and white c oat unless dir ected otherwise by their preceptor s. 3. Students wishing to schedule a shadowing experience with a CUSOM clinical faculty memb er must submit the Shadowing Agreement Form , (available from the Office of Clinical Affairs) c ompleted in its entirety to the Office of Clinical Affairs. 4. Shadowing experiences should be arranged in conjunction with the preceptor and Regional Dean/Director of Student Medical Education (DSME ), both of whom must sign the agreement form to indicate their approval. 5. Students m ust sign the f orm a nd initial all required attestations. 72 6. The completed form must be submi tted to the Office of Clinical Affairs for review and approval at least two (2) weeks prior to the start of the requested shadowing e xperience. Shad owing with non-CUSOM Clinicians 1. Students who desire to shadow non-CUS OM clinicians must arrange the experience on their own. 2. These are non-CUSOM sanctioned experiences thus: a. CUSOM will not obta in affiliation agreements with the si tes in order to provide shadowing experiences. b. CUSOM will n ot provide the c linician or si te with any student records including, but not limited to, results of drug screens and backgro und checks, i mmuniz ation records, acade mic performance information or letters of recommendation. c. Students may not wear their CUSOM white coat or name tag. d. Students or the physician they are shadowi ng are not protected by malpractice insurance through Campbell University . e. Students acknowl edge tha t Campbell Unive rsity will not be li able for any medi cal care or expenses if they a re injured or become ill during the clinical shadowing experience. They a lso r elease C ampbell Univ ersity f rom any liability from a ny injury or illness which occurs during the shadowing e xperience. 3. Even if engaging in shadowing experiences with non-CUSOM clinicians or clinical sites, students must abide by all general guidelines noted previous ly in this doc ument. Violation of any conditions of this Shad owing Policy is handled as a professionalism issue and may be referred to the Academic Performance, Promotion an d Standards (APPS) Committee. 5.2 Years 1 and 2 Curriculum The first two years of the CUSOM curriculum focus on funda ment al prin ciples of biome dical science as well as significant emphasis on clinical science, elements of clinical practice, and professionalism. Historical ly, the fi rst two years of medi cal school ins truction ha ve been vi ewed as \"pre-clinical\" with the remainin g two years being viewed as \"clinical\". At CUS OM, the curriculum is integrated to provide a core of strong biome dical principles in addition to a robust founda sciences ofessionalism. 73 5.2.1 Curricular Content Overview All semest ers of the first and second year are partitioned into two 9-week Blocks, with the except ion of ten (10) weeks for Block 4 and eleve n (11) weeks for Block 8. Within the first two Blocks, students are in troduced to the biome dical y, Pathology, Pharmacolo gy, and Physiology. Anatomy is taught throughout the first year, in Blocks 1- 4, as a component of an integrated systems approach. In Blocks 3 throu gh 8, the CUSOM c urriculum follows a n organ-system approach to medi cal education. Facu lty incorporate instructional materials which go beyond the basic bio medical principles mastered during the first semest er. Biomedical faculty , prim ary care physicians, and sub-specialty physicians collaborate to deliver integrated content relating to the particular organ system. The Clinical Skills and Ost eopathic Manipula tive Medicine courses address content that will allow CUSOM students to learn, integrate , and apply the basic philosophy , principles, and practice of osteo pathic medi cine. Hands-on of osteopa thic whol e-person incorporate stat e-of-the-art instruction. Addit ionally, Simulation and Standardized Patient experiences allow stude nts to enhance their c linical skills, such as physical exam te chniques, interviewing, couns eling, and medical reporting skills necessa ry to progre ss to the third a nd fourth years. The Founda tions of Medical Practice (FMP) courses provide CUSOM students a broad ov erview of biostatistics, epidemiology , population health, re search methodol ogy, and experimental design for practicing evidenced -based medicine . Students are exposed to the calcul ations and strategies required to appropr iately locate, interpret, design, and comple te a research/schol arly paper with clinically relevant knowl edge related to compet ent medi cal practice. The Professional Core Compet encies (PCC) courses, presented through all semest ers of the first- and second- year curriculum , are designed to teach the core compet encies neces sary for caring, compassionat e, effective, and holistic practice of osteopathic medicine throug hout the physician's career. The use of lectur e, discussion, and other unique ac tivities in troduces students to medical humani ties, biome dical ethics, medi cal law and jurisprudence, quality improvement and pa tient safety, global health issues, and profe ssionalism. 74 5.2.2 Schedule of Course Offerings OMM = Ost eopathic Manipul ative M edicine FMP = Foundations of Medical Practice PCC = Professional Core Competencies FIRST YEAR SEMESTER 1 (FALL) SEMESTER 2 (SPRING) Bloc k 1 Integrated Basic Science & Clinical Courses Bloc k 2 Integrated Basic Science & Clinical Courses Bloc k 3 Musculoskeletal System Bloc k 4 Neuroscience & Human Behavio r (Psychiatry) OMED 500 OMM OMED Clinical Skills Skills OMED 506 FMP OMED 507 PCC OMED 522 Ph armacology 540 Physiology OMED 551 Pathology OMED 560 Anatomy OMED 508 OMM OMED Clinical eopathic Manipul ative M edicine FMP = Foundations of Medical Practice PCC = Professional Core Competencies CABS I = C linical Applications of Biomedical Sciences I CABS II = C linical Applications of Biomedical Sciences II 5.2.3 Course Description s The curriculum in Blocks 1 and 2 of the first year introduces studen ts to the foundational biomedical conce pts of Cell and Molecular Biology , consists of introduc tory clinical training in osteop athic principles and practice in addition to basic clinica l skills.

Students will demonstrate their ability to perform an integrated osteopathic phy sical examination and treatment at a level commensurate with a student entering clinical rotation s. OMED 616: Clinical Skills and Lab - 0.5 Credits The Clinical Skills course is presented longitudinal ly over the first two years, and this continuum prepares students with the fundament al skills of patient assessment. T hrough the use of brief interactive lectures, small group discussion, ha nds-on pr actice, si mulation, 92 standardized patient experiences, and interprofessional educational activities studen ts develop appropriate professional behaviors and clinical skills such as patient-centered interviewing, physical exam ination, funda mental procedural skills, medical documentation and reporting, patient education and couns eling. Block 8 focuses on the r eproductive system, including the s exual history, the female genital and br east exam ination, a nd the newb orn 618: Foundat ions of Med ical Practice - 0.5 Credits The two -year Foundations of Medical Practice course series provides a broad overview of evidenced -based medicine, epidemiology, research methodology, and experimental design. Block 8 is the culmination of the series. Four self -directed learning sessions focus on the definition and history of human subjects' rese arch and crucial ethical considerations. In addition, this Block provides an opportunity for students to review Biostatistics and Epidemiology/Population Health concepts learned in earlier Blocks. OMED 619: Professional Core Competencies - 0.5 Credits Medical Professionalism and other professional competencies necessa ry for effective, compassionate, ethical, and competent osteopathic me dical pract ice are foundat ional to a career in me dicine. This course and its content are designed to actively promote all aspects of a healthy professional life and ensure lifelong learning while simultaneously exposing students to the basic concep ts of biomedical ethics, medical law, profe ssionalism, and the structure of h ealth system s. Using lecture discussion, self-directed le arning m odule s, case-discussion and group exerci ses, student s learn and apply concept s relevant to a professional life in medicine. Block 8 PCC will focus on various ethical issues , including human sexuality, human trafficking, statutory rape, child abuse/neglect, domestic violence, sexual assault, and pregnancy choices. OMED 690: Clinical Ap plications of Biomedical Science s II - 5.0 Credits The transition from the first two years of medical instruction - a more classroom and le cture/discussion f ocus - to the more clinical, hands- on focus uti lized in the third and fourth years, can be challenging for students. I n an effort to ease this transition, to review key material necessa ry for clinical practice, and to integrate the k ey concepts and processe s of the first two years instruction into future clinical practice, the Clinical Application of Biomedical Sciences II course is prov ided as a capstone for entry into the th ird and fourth years of the CUSOM curriculum. 93 This course is delivered as a mix of lecture/discussion review of material, case studies to highlight key point s from specific organ systems and across the continuum of health, and group review/study. The course is likewise designed to integrate and consolidate the content from the first two years with requisite knowl edge and skills of the th ird and fourth years. Completion of this course will prepare students for su ccessful application and passage of COMLEX-USA Leve l 1 and entry into the third year. OMED 695: Reproductive System - 3.5 Credits The aim of this course is to provide the CUS OM student with a firm foundation of the str ucture, function, pa thophy siology, pha rmacol ogy, and clinical relevance of the r eproductive system. The student will be able to use this knowledge to provide thoughtful and competent care to the whole patient by integrating reproductive health needs . 5.2.4 Modified Course of Study A Modified Course of Study (MCOS) (OMED 698: 12.0 Credits) is a credit - bearing, individualized study plan for students who require an alternative educational pathway for reasons such as mandated board preparation, required remediation, illness, leaves of absence, or withdrawals. The Modified Course of Study will be individually designed based upon the student's performance and needs by the respective Associate Dean and approved by the APPS Committee. Students on a Modified Course of Study must agree to and comply with the conditions and schedule of the Modified C ourse of Study. Students not following the individualized plan may be called to the APPS Committee or placed on Suspension ( and thus be ineligible for financial aid and not considered an active student) at any time. 5.2.5 Curricular Integration of OPP and OMM CUSOM provides opportunities for integration of osteopathic philosophy, principles, and practices, including didactic and hands -on activities, through all four years of the curriculum. A standardized, competency -based syllabus format is utilized to deliver OPP and OMM throughout the first and second years of the curriculum in the following manner: 5.2.5.1 Year One Each student will receive a minimum of 3 hours per week of didactic and hands-on OMM inst ruction unde r the supe American Osteopathic Board of N euromus culoske letal Medicine Board certified physician and with the assistance of DO faculty table facilitators (approx imate facul ty to student ratio 1:10). 94 The first-year courses will provide instruction related to the history of osteopa thic medi cine, research efforts in and physiological principles of osteo pathic cine. Students will also learn the neuromus culoske letal basis of disease and how it integrates with basic sciences su ch as anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, etc. In addition, students will learn and practic e various osteop athic manipulative treatments, such as soft tissue techniques , muscle energy, counterstrain, high-velocity, low amplitude (HVL A) and myofascial release techniques to treat somatic dysfunction and integrate into the management of certain disease states. 5.2.5.2 Year Two Each student will receive a minimum of 3 hours per week of didactic and hands -on OMM instruction under the supervision of an American Osteopathic Board of Neuromusculoskeletal Medicine Board Certified physician and with the assistance of DO faculty table facilitators (approximate faculty to student ratio 1:10). During the second year, the course is organized by body system. Students are instructed on the integration of OPP and OMM in the treatment of somatic dysfunction commonly observed in the management of medical conditions in each system. S tudents will gain a deeper understanding of incorporating viscerosomatic reflexes and Chapman points to help guide the development of a differential diagnosis and the therapeutic goals of incorporating OPP into the overall medical management of these conditions . Students will also become more adept at incorporating ost eopathic principles and manipulative medicine in the management of special patient populations including pediatrics , geriatrics, and pregnancy. The OMM lab will also provide students with a regular review of common techniques used to manage conditions such as short lower extremity, tension and migraine cephalgia, and cervical/thoracic/lumbar dysfunctions. 5.2.5.3 Years Three and Four See Section 5.3.13 of this Bulletin for a description of the integration of OPP and OMM throughout the third - and fourth- years of the curriculum. 95 5.3 Years 3 and 4 Curriculum 5.3.1 Philosop hy of Clinical Training CUSOM students in years three and four are assigned to R egional Sites/C linical Campuses. Site assignment takes place during the second year. Clinical rotations occur within hospital sites for inpatient experiences, in ambulatory practices, and in geriatric acute care and long -term facilities. All students will spend time in rural, small, urban, or critical access hospitals for a rural/underserved care clinical experience. The clinical rotations are designed to provide the student with an education in the general areas of medicine, surgery, pediatrics, obstet rics/gynecology, psychiatry, family medicine, and emergency medicine. The philosophical framework of clinical education and training at CUSOM is to prepare students to become osteopathic physicians possessing the highest competencies in the profession. T he program educates students to be competent osteopathic physicians who clearly recognize their roles as professionals and providers of comprehensive healthcare to the individual , the family as a unit , and to the communities they serve. Osteopathic physic ians must be able to function in the role of the leader of a healthcare team to bring about needed change from the level of the individual to the level of the community. The ultimate intent of the program is to prepare patient -centered physicians who will positively impact the equality of healthcare and healthcare delivery systems and will improve healthcare access for individuals and their families. CUSOM believes the physician must assume a leadership role not only in the medical community but also in the broader community in which he/she serves. Community leadership is an integral part of improving the healthcare of the community as -a-whole; thus, physicians must be committed to the prevention of illness and the upgrading of the delivery of healthcare services at extended levels. In pursuit of excellence, the CUSOM clinical curriculum is a challenging blend of tradition al and innovative components de signed to: Foster the analytic and problem-solvi ng skills requisite for physicians invol ved in disease prevention, diagnosis, and treatment in individual patients, f amilies, communities, a nd populations a t-large; Ensu re the acquis ition and application of basic clinical knowl edge and essential clinical skills; Develop an und erstanding of contempor ary healthcare delivery issues; Cultivate effective physician-patient relationships based upon integrity, respect, a nd compassion; Develop hi gh ethical standards; and Promote a lifelong c ommitment to l earning. 96 Following clinical training, students will be knowl edgeable about the important roles of the prim ary care physician in cluding, but not limited to, the a bility to: Demonstr ate clinical excellence, and biom edical knowl y and manage their patients' med ical conditions ; Provide continuing and compr ehensive care to individuals and fa milies; Integrate the behavioral, emotional, soc ial, and envi ronment al factors of individuals a nd families in promoting health and man aging disease; Develop and maintain t he knowl edge, skills, and attitudes required for the delivery of quality care and outcom es in m odern medical practice in a rapidly changing world; Pursue a regular and systematic p rogram of lif elong learning; Recognize ind ications for and initiate consul tation with other medical specialis ts while maintaining continuity of care; Share tasks a nd respons ibilities w ith other heal thcare professionals; Be aware of the findi ngs of relevant research; understand and critically evaluate th is bod y of research, and apply the results of re search to medical pr actice; Manage his/her practice in a business -like, cost -efficient manner which will provide professional satisfaction and time for a rewarding personal life; Serve as an advoc ate for the p atient wi thin the healthcare system; Assess the quality of care he/she provides and actively pursue measures to continually improve ; Use current medi cal knowl edge to identi fy, evaluate, and minimize risks for p atients and fa milies; Recognize community resour ces as an integral part of the healthcare system and participate in improving the heal th of the community; Inform and couns el pati ents concerni ng their health problems and recognize and value differences in patient and physician back grounds, beliefs, and expectation s; Develop ph ysician-patient relationsh ion and pr oblem-solvi ng; Balance potential benefits, costs, and resources in determining appropr iate in terventions; and Integrate and effectively utilize osteopa thic principles and practices in the d elivery of optimal p atient care. The gene ral expectations for all clinical rotations are designed to help students develop the funda ment al skills of medi cal probl em solvi ng, case management, procedur al expertise, and professional demeanor. Some clinical rotations f ocus on data acquisition (medical history, phy sical exam ination, laboratory data, or literature review) while others emphasi ze psychomot or skil ls or a ttitudes and feelings. 97 Clinical rotations are und er the direct supervision of the CUSOM Office of Clinical Affairs, led by the Asso ciate Dean for Clinical Affairs. CUSOM has establis hed affiliations with a wide range of hospitals, clinics, and physicians offering di verse training oppor tunities. The clinical program has been organized to permit the greatest degree of educat ional exposure in a practical, clinical environme nt and to develop expertise in the a reas of p atient diagn osis and manage ment. The clinical rot ations provide d at each affiliated clinical campus and the number of CUS OM students a ssigned to each af filiate d clinical campus are determined by mutual agree ment with CUSOM, the Asso ciate Dean for Cl inical Affairs, the Hospit al Admin istrator(s), Regional Dean, Vi ce-President for Medical Education (VPME) / Director of M edical Education (DME), Clinical Faculty, and the Office of Clinical Affairs. Whe never possible, CUSOM utilizes hospit als with accredited postdoctoral residency training pr ograms approve d by the A ccreditation Counc il for Graduate M edical Education (ACGME) for postdoc toral training to provide assurance of adequate teachi ng material and facul CUSOM's third-year osteopa thic medi cal students are required to comple te twelve rot ations.

They are designed to help students develop the fundamental skills of medical problem solving, case management, procedural expertise, and professional demeanor. Some rotations f ocus on data acquisition (medical history, physical examination, laboratory data, or literature review), while others deal primarily with psychomotor skills or attitudes and feelings. Students should review these objectives carefully as their evaluation on each rotation will in large measure be based on achievement of these objectives. As a result of each clinical rotation, students should become better able to obtain an adequate, logical, and sequential medical history. Students should include in the history of present illness (HPI) those pertinent positive and negative features which demonstrate your understanding of the patient's medical condition(s) . All drugs, treatments, and important previous milestones concerning that illness should be clearly n oted. Past H istory will contain but not be limited to the following : Compl ete present medi cation use, including doses and lengths of time on the drug, plus prior medication experience, when applicable ; All p revious sur geries, including approximate dates and sequelae; All p revious injuri es and any sequelae; Immuni zations ; Quantitative estimate of alcohol, tobacco, or illicit drug use, and other appropriate social histo ry; and All untow ard drug reactions (allergic or toxic), including anesthetic agents and specific r eaction. If none , it sh ould be clearly noted. Family History will include all diseases with a familial tendency, or which may have a bearing on the HPI. List the ages and health sta tus of a ll first-degree relatives. 122 Review of Systems will contain some notation for each body system. Detailed and compl ete system historie s are mandatory for symptoms un covered during the review of systems. Physical Examination - Perform and record an appropriate physical examina tion, which includes: Accurate and compl ete thoug htful de scription of the patient's general appearance and behavior; A thorough and complete description of physical findings pertinent to the HPI; and Careful attention to findi ngs suggested by the past medi cal histo ry or review of systems. The remainder of the physical examination must be sufficiently detailed in order to identify incidental abnormal findings not related to the present illness or positive historical clues. Documentation - Students must document a complete History & Physical (H&P ) in the patient's chart. It should include a brief summary statement, which demonstrates the student has synthesized the historical and physical exam data. Oral Presentation - Orally present the patient's data to the re sident and/or attending physician in 5 -10 minutes in standard, logical, sequential fashion, demonstrating an understanding of the patient's disease process and its manifestations in the patient. Differential Diagnosis - Apply basic medical knowledge in synthesizing a differential diagnosis and plan of management to solve the patient's medical problems. Success in this area requires the ability to: Generate a clear probl em list; Develop a plan of action to c onfirm a di agnosis ; Review the pertinent literature to expand student knowl edge of the problem; Identify indicated l aboratory tests; Suggest a therapeutic plan of treatment; Define patient education obj ectives and assess the patient's unde rstanding; Perform as an effective memb er of the health care team and the patients' primary physician; Gather patient information and data and offer an interpretation of the data relevant to the p atient's probl ems; Report data on rounds and in the progress notes. P rogress notes should reflect a dispassiona te report; and Acquire sufficient knowledge and skill concerning the patient's problem 123 Affective and Professional Behavior - Demonst rate and develop the following affective (attitud es, feelings) and behavioral characteristics: Work with p atients in a respectful, compassion ate, caring, and empath etic mann er; Develop a profession al attitude and demeanor in working with patients, peers, faculty, house staff, health care profession als, and othe r persons in the health care setting; and Identify and emulate appropriate role models among attending physicians and hous e staff, includi ng those who demonstr ate the process of developing rapport and positive communi catio ns with patients, f aculty, house staff, and ot her healthcar e profession als. Demonst rate the followi ng profession al behaviors: Reliability and de pendability Self-awareness Emotional sta bility Integrity and hone sty Initiative and enthusiasm Punc tualit y Self-education 5.4.2 Ethical Standards Essential hum anistic qualities required of physicians are integrity, respect, and compassion. INTEG RITY is the personal commit ment to be hone st and trustwo rthy; this include s evaluatio n and de monst ration of one's own skills and abilitie s. RESPECT is the personal commitment to honor other's choices and rights regarding thems elves a nd their medical care. COMPAS SION is an appreciation that suffering and illness engender special needs for comfort and he lp without e voking excessive emotional involvement. In broad terms, these words propose the qualities of mind and feeling a physician shoul d bring to the profession of medi cine. T hey enforce no orthodox y. They do not establish a hierarchy of values or issue imperatives. They do not force the varied facets of each physician's personality into a rigid mold. These words describe a good relationship between patient and physician. A relationship, in whi ch the dignity and freedom of both parties are respected, and their expectations and needs are acknowl edged. This description can be interpreted in many ways; its application to different styles of personality and to diff erent situ ations is v ariable. 124 rds As future physici ans, m edical students ha ve a re sponsibility to guide their actions to s erve the b est inter est of their fellow students, pa tients, and faculty. This responsibility is uphe ld by maintaining the highe st degree of p ersonal and profession al integrity. T o meet these obj ectives, the following st andards a re expected of all m edical stud ents at CUSOM.

They sha ll: Be truthful in carrying out education al and clinical responsibilities; never falsify information , including patient histories, physical examinations, or laboratory data, or purposely mis represent a situation; never tamper with, remove, or destroy patient records or education al materials, in cluding slides or anatomic al diss ections; Maintain confidentiality of information concer ning patients and refrain from discussing c ases except unde r appropriate circumst ances; Be punc tual, reliable, and conscientious in fulfilling profession al duties, including attendance at lectures, examinations, and clinical rotations ; Not p articipate in patient care when unde r the influ ence of any substance or ot her conditions, whi ch could impair jud gment or ability to function; Maintain profession al hygiene, demeanor, and appearance when in a patient care setting or representing CUSOM ; Accept the responsibi lity to review plans or directives for patient care with the attending physician when, after careful consideration, the student be lieves these plans or di rectives are not in the be st inter ests of the patient; Clearly identify their role as medi cal stud ents in the patient care setting; Seek a ppropriate faculty supervision; and Respect civil laws, hospital rules, and university rules governing the conduct of medical students. 125 Medical students sh all show compassion and respect for thems elves, th eir families, their colleagues, faculty, staff , and, most importantly, the patients who participate in th eir education. They sh all: Within the confines of profession al confidentiality, establish rapport and deal hone stly with pa tients, colleagues, faculty, staff, and the patient's family; Respect patients, their families, and their professional colleagues, includi ng staff and other health care provide rs, regardless of their age, sex, race, national origin, religion, socioeconomic status, state of health, personal habits, s exual orientation, cleanliness or attitud e; and Care for thems elves by following good health maintenance practices related to physical and me ntal health and seek help in this r egard when help is n eeded. 5.5 Clinical Rotation Scheduling 5.5.1 Assig ned Rotations Students are provided a schedule of their assigned rotations. No changes are allowed, except for extenuating medical, financial, or personal hardships, which will be reviewed and are at the discretion and approval of the Associate Dean for Clinical Affa irs. Assigned rotations not completed will be recorded as a failure (FC) and will be referred to the Academic P erformance, Promotion and Sta ndards (APPS) Committee . If a student is allowed to continue in the program, they may be placed on a Modified Course of Study in order to make up the rotation at a later time as designated by the APPS Committee and the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs. Placement on a Modified Course of Study may result in a delay in the student's graduation date and may adversely affect financial aid and the student's ability to participate in the residency match process. 5.5.2 Notice of Site Changes Clinical training sites are subject to change. While the training sites are subject to change without notice to students, those students who are in clinical rotations at the time of the change will be accommodated for the duration of the rotation when possible. Rotation s ites will be updated annually. 5.5.3 Selective Rotations If the student decides to exercise the option of completing one (1) of the fourth - year Selectives away from their assigned clinical campus , the student must arrange for the Selective rotation as they would for an elective . 126 5.5.4 Rural and Underserved Rotation s The third -year Ru ral and Underserved rotation may be e ither at a rur al site or a non-rural under served site. Rural and und erserved area s are usu ally, but not always, d esignated or qua lify as a H PSA (He alth Professiona l Short age Ar ea) or MUA (Medically Underserved Area) thr ough federal or st ate stand ards. Third - year Rural and Unde rserved rotations must be in a primary care medi cal field such as Family M edicin e, Inte rnal M edicin e, or P ediatrics must be compl eted at a n appr opriate facility or earing a f e xecuted af filiation agreement at the R egional Site. These should be per formed at outpatient c linics: outpati ent Family M edicine, Internal M edicine or P ediatrics. The Student Medical Education Clinical Coordinator for Third -Year can assist you in identifying a Ru ral/Underserved site a nd you can also review the regional AHEC site at www.ncahec.ne t. 5.5.5 Electives In order to uphold the credibility of CUSOM students and the institution , it is necessary to maintain elective rotation commitments. If a student must cancel an elective, they must first notify the Office of Clinical Affairs, no later than four (4) weeks prior to the start of that rotation. Cancellations will not be accepted after that time. This policy is necessary because many hospitals reserve elective slots for students and may turn away students from other schools. Withdrawal on short notice means a desirable rotation slot is wasted. This is unfair to the hospital and, more importantly, it is unfair to fellow students. Any changes received after the deadline must be accompanied by official documentation certifying the student has been cance lled by the physician/hospital originally registered. A letter from the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs stating the student is in good standing, immunizations are current, and the provision of proof of coverage by CUSOM's malpractice insurance will be sent to the designated host institution for each outside elective rotation. Students must arrange their own electives with the clinical campus Student Medical Education Coordinator. Questions regarding the scheduling of third- or fourth -year rotations s hould be directed to the respective clinical campus Student Medical Education Coordinator or the appropriate CUSOM Student Medical Education Clinical Coordinator. Although it is preferred students schedule their elective rotation for four consecutive week s, some rotations may be split into two 2- week elective rotations. The specific rotations eligible for two -week rotations and limitations of this option are reviewed in Section 5.3 of this Bulletin . 127 5.5.6 Elective and O ther Rotations Information regarding the scheduling of Elective and Selective rotations may be found in Section 5.3. 5 of this Bulletin . Rotation approval forms for requested Elective, Selective , or other rotations must be submitted to the Office of Clinical Affairs a min imum of sixty ( 60) days before the beginning of the requested rotation. Many clinical sites requir e a list of do cuments in o rder to p articipate in a rotation at their site s. This may include but is not limit ed to: Letter of Good Standing ( states your acade mic sta nding, BLS Immuniz ation ( vacc ination, e tc.); Crimin al Background Check; Drug Proof of ability/Malpra ctice Cov erage For liability reasons, the CUSOM Office of Clinical Affairs will not release the proof of liability/malpractice coverage to the student, but can release this information, in one form or another, to a requesting entity only for the purposes of clinical coordination. In order to facilitate the provision of these documents to the clinical site, students must provide the following information to the Student M edical Education Clinical Coordinator for F ourth -Year: Name, title, fax number , and em ail address of the contact person; Name of healthcare or medical edu cation institution requesting documentation; and A list of the document ation the entity is specifically requesting. ** No travel plans regarding away rotations should be made by the student until they have received official approval from the Office of Clinical Affairs and notice of a fully executed affiliation agreement. ** 5.5.7 Family Medicine Preceptor Rotations Rotations must be scheduled for four (4) consecutive weeks with an office -based or residency -based family physician. The precepting physician must be board certified in Family Medicine. 5.5.8 Out-of-State Rotations All out -of-state rotations are subject to the State Author ization and Reciprocity Act. This is federal legislation requiring states to abide by state-assigned law which may require students doing either online education or distance learning to obtain the formal permission of the state to serve as a clinical practicum or medical clerkship within their state. Each state has a different requirement for state authorization or approval. The federal penalty for violating the State 128 Authorization and Reciprocity Act is loss of federal education funding for the institution. This legislation affects all educational institutions, including CUSOM. Stude nts desiring to participate in a clinical rotation outside of the state of North Carolina must work with the Office of Clinical Affairs to ensure all conditions of the State Autho rization and Reciprocity Act are met. This is in addi tion to the completion of the Away Rotation R equest form and submission of all required documentatio n. The process for requesting out-of-state c linical rotations is a s follows: Compl ete the Affiliation Agree ment Request form, available from the Office of Clini cal Affairs on CUSOM's web -based evaluation system , between six (6) months and no less than sixty (60) days prior to the start of the rotation. Clinical Affairs will review the compl eted form and work with the Provost 's Office staff to establish n ecessar y state approvals to complete the rotation. Clinic al Affairs will noti fy the student of the status of the request at least thirty (30) d ays prior to the start of the rotation . Any further questions or concerns regarding CUSOM 's policy on the State Author ization and Reciprocity Act should be sent to the Office of Clin ical Affairs. 5.5.9 International R otations Specific information regarding the scheduling of international rotations may be found in Section 5.3.10 of this Bulletin . A limited number of international rotations are available for fourth -year Elective Rotations. International Medical Mission rotation s must be at CUSOM -affiliated sites and approved in advance by the Department of Community and Global Health, the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs, the Dean, and the Campbell University Study Abroad Committee. A signed affiliation agreement between CUS OM and the internationa l organization must be in place at least ninety ( 90) days prior to the clinical rotation. CU SOM does not assume any liability for health or safety while on international rotations. All international experiences must compl y with CUSOM poli cies for international rotations. Requirements for students wishing to do a n international rotation include : Must be in good acade mic standing ; Must h ave taken and passed COMLEX-USA Level 1; Must have approval of the rotation from the Department of Communi ty and Glob al Health, the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs, the Dean, and the Campbe ll Univ ersity Study Abro ad Committee ave necessa ry immuni zations, pa ssport, and other requirements for travel; 129 Students are responsible for obtaining travel insurance, including evacu ation coverage and proof of such must be presented with the required forms for international travel. Stu dents must have completed the Travel Safety SDL and electroni cally sign to acknowledge unde rstanding of safe practic e in foreign country prior to t ravel; and At the completion of the rotation, the student m ust prepare a written case report from his/h er clinical experience abroad (no more than two pages, topic pertinent to the country of rotation, e.g., tropi cal diseases, occupa Clinical R otation Information M ilitary Rotations All students in the Military may serve certain rotations in the Military with approval by the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs. A copy of the military orders must be presented to the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs for approval. 5.5.11 Away Rotation Requests All students desiring to compl ete elective rotations away from their assigned CUSOM clinical campus must complete an affi liation agree ment request form. A hyperlink to this form may be found on CUSOM 's web -based evaluation system. All affiliation agree ment requests must be subm itted in a timely manner (at least sixty ( 60) days prior to the start of a domestic r otation and a t least 90-180 day s for all international rotations) . Unauthorized Rotations: Any student starting an Elective or Selective rotation without a fully executed affiliation agreement with the Office of Clinic al Affairs will not receive credit for that rotation, and all violations will be subject to review by the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee . For questions regarding the process, students should contact their clinical campus student medic al education coordi nator or the cal edu cation clinical coordin ators f or third -year or fourth -year. 5.5.12 Scheduling Away R otations Many elective rotations for fourth- year are scheduled through VSLO (Visiting Student Learning Opportunities) and Clinician Nexus. Information regarding using VSLO and Clinician Nexus to schedule rotations may be obtained from the Student Medical Education Clinical Coordinator for Fourth- Year. Additional information regarding VSLO is also available on CUSOM's web- based evalu ation system. 130 5.5.13 Addition al Rotation I nformation Timely Approval It is extremely impor tant students complete their affiliation agreeme nt requests on time. Failure to submit the appropriate forms within the timeframe allotted may result in a rotation being assigned to the student by his/her respective clinical campus Student Medical Education Coordinator and Regional Dean /DMSE . No rotation may be started without being a pproved (see Unauthori zed Rotations). Unauthoriz ed Rotat ions Any student starting an Elective or Selective rotation without a fully executed affiliation agreement with the Office of Clinic al Affairs will not receive credit for that rotation and all violations will be subject to review by the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee . For questions regarding the process, students should contact their clinical campus Student Medical Education Coordi nator or the Student Medi cal Edu cation Clinical Coordina tor for the Third -Year or Fourth- Year . 5.6 General Policies and Procedures - Clinical Rotations 5.6.1 Overview Medical stud ents will w ork directly unde r the supervision of an attending physician. A licens ed physician must countersign all entries in the patient record. Students must clearly identify themselves in the medi cal record as either an MS -3 or an MS -4 student. Histo ry & Physicals: Students are responsible assigned H&Ps, including osteopathic stru ctural exams. Preceptors will review student performance and provide constructive feedback to assist in improvement . Procedures: Students may, only with direct supervision, perform a procedure in the presence of a licensed physician. Under NO circumst ances are students to attempt a procedure without direct supe rvision. Rounds : The student's direct supervisor will provide the schedule to make rounds on each service. Students are expected to be prompt and prepared to discuss the status of patients and any results/ reports which may have been received. This is the time to ask questions. Students should not be afraid to speak up if there is something needing clarification . 131 Morning Report: Many services will have a morning report, where the \"on- call\" house staff will report on the events of each patient during the night. This is also where the chief resident will make assignments for the day. There is usually an education al component during this time. This conference is MANDAT ORY if the student is on a service with morning report. BE ON TIME and be prepared. Procedure Workshop, Simulation or Skills Lab : Occasional ly during the rotation or at the clinical training site, workshops or \"skills labs\" will be given to enhance procedura l or OMT training . Atte ndanc e is MANDATORY. I f assigned, students are expected to attend and be prepared. Didactics: Each service and clinical site has its own didactic schedule, which will be provide d the first day on service. Atte ndance at all didac tic sessions is MANDA TORY. In the event a student is outside a 30-minute travel radius from the site, teleconferenc e options are available for lectures scheduled for one hour, such as noon conferences and morning report. Students must be in- person for half -day didactic programming at their respective clinical campus. I f students ar e performi ng dutie s related to the rotation, such as participating in a surgica l case or delivery, the student MUST communi cate the explanation for the absence with the clinical campus Student Medical Education Coordinator . Evaluations : Please remind the preceptor to complete their student evaluation in the web-based evaluation s ystem. All evaluations are to be compl eted online and must be compl eted in a timely fashion as not ed in Section s 6.2.7.1- 6.2.7.3 of this Bulletin . Prior to completion of the r otation, students are expected to compl ete evaluations of the rotation and of the preceptor . Compl etion of these evaluations are required as this information is utilized in an anony mous fashion to provide valuable feedback and assist CUSOM in its effort to continually improve its clinical rotation program. A rotation will be regarde d as Incomplete (IC) until the student r otation evaluation has been compl eted. Any specific preceptor or rotation concer n should not wait for documentation in the end-of-rotation evaluation but should be brought to the immedia te attention of the Regional Dean/DSME or Asso ciate Dean for Clinic al Affa irs. Electronic Health Record (EHR): At most training sites, students will receive a Username and Password for accessing the EHR in use on that rotation. With this, students will be able to access protected personal health information. Students must sign a \"confidentiality agreement\" to rec eive this access. DO NOT use others' U sernames and P asswords. This is a HIPAA violation and may carry legal penalties. 132 Confi dentiality: All rotating students must sign a Confi dentiality and Non- Disclosure Agreement. This agreement will allow the stude nt to receive a Username and Passwo rd for comput er access for the above applications. Conf identiality policies also apply to non-electronic patient information - all must be protected and shared only with those who have a profession al need- to-know. 5.6.2 Responsibilities and Duties The student, while on a rotation service, will at all times be responsible to the personnel in charge of the service involved. In addition, all students will be expected to comply with the general rules establish ed by the hospital or clinic at which they are being trained. All problems or difficultie s should be communi cated imme diately to the Regional Dean/DSME and the CUSOM Office of Clinic al Affairs. As discuss ed in previous sections of this Bulletin , students must attend all hospital confere nces related to their rotation service. In addition, students should attempt to attend any other hospit al conferences or education al programs of interest (with appropriate super visor pe rmission). A s chedule of the hosp ital education al programs should be obtaine d each week or month from the hospital Department of Medical Education. Morning report attendance is mandatory. Any time spent away from the hospi tal/clinic during regular duty hours for lectures, conferences, and other progra ms conducte d at local hospital/clinic or university must be approved as noted e lsewhere in this Bulletin . Althoug h patient care assignments take precedence over lectu res and conferences, the hospital and attending physicians are encour aged to allow the students to attend scheduled lectures. The di rector of the individual clinical service must approve absences fr om c linical dut y in advance. 5.6.3 Standa rds of Professional Con duct Appropriate behavior regarding patients, staff, and other clinicia ns is expected in all situations. P receptors are instructed to report any attendance, appear ance, or behavioral probl ems to the R egional Dean/DSME and Office of Clinic al Affairs immedia tely. As healthcare practitioners, students are required to conform to the highest stand ards of ethical and pro fession al condu ct. Th ese include , but ar e not limite d to: Respect of colleagues, staff, patients, & faculty Flexibilit y Academic integrity Honesty & trustwo rthiness Accountabili ty for personal actions & work/ass ral compet ency 133 Students are exp ected to adhere to the s ame high ethical and pr ofession al standards required of p racticing physi cians. The pr ofession al conduc t of students is e valuated on an ongoing ba sis thr oughout the didac tic and clinical years of the CUSOM pr ogram. Violations of sta ndards of c onduc t are subj ect to faculty review a nd may be referred to the Ac ademic P erformance, Promotion and Sta ndards (APPS) Committee . 5.6.4 Preceptor - Stude nt Interactions The student should maintain a professional relationship with the preceptor and adhere to appropriate professional boundaries at all times . Contact through web- based social networking sites (e.g., Facebook, Twitter) should be avoided. Career networking through professional sites, such as LinkedIn, is acceptable. All students shall refrain from any inappropriate relationship with students/faculty/staff/preceptors to the extent the relationship may compromise any policies or expectation s of the University. Inappropriate relationships include any romantic or physically intimate liaison with a student outside the bonds of marriage. 5.6.5 Dress Code CUSOM recogniz es the in mainta ining an atmosphe re conducive to the deliver y of qua lity h ealth care. Students are always expected to d ress in a p rofession al and appropriate manner in accor dance with Section 6.5 of this Bulletin . Please note, business attire is appropriate for all clinical rotations. Men are required to wear a shirt and a tie with slacks or khakis unless otherwise directed by their clinical preceptor. Thin strap or racer back tank tops must be covered with a sweater or jacke t. Low cut or strapless tops or dresses are not permitted. Jeans, T -shirts , and flip- flops are not permitted. Closed- toe shoes are required. Shoes should be professional (no tennis shoes), comfortable and functional. You must be able to stand in them for hours at a time and run if necessary. The student must w ear professiona l attire as desc ribed in th e Section 6.5 of this Bulletin. CLEAN , short, white lab coats with a Campbell University patch are required at all times. If the CUSOM embroidered lab coat is dirty, students are permitted to wear a non -Campbell -issued , short, white lab coat until the original coat is cleaned. Students must wear their CUSOM ID badge at all times as noted below. On serv ices where scrubs are indi cated, they will be provi ded by the training facility. S crubs are not to be w orn outside of the t eaching fa cility. Stud ents will wear appropriate p rofession al attire to and from the institution. 134 Approved identi fication will be worn as dict ated by each training facility. Students are required to car ry their CUSOM identifica tion (ID) badges at all times. In cases of lost ID badges, students must contact CUSOM to obtain a new ID badge. If students arrive without a lab coat or are inappropriately dressed, they may be asked to leave the rotation and may NOT be allowed to participate in clinical activities. This may result in an unexcused absence and will require further action and review by the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs. Inappropriate dress may also be considered a pro fessionalism issue and may be referred to the APPS Committe e. Good personal hygiene is expected. Do not wear overpowering cologne or perfume . Scrubs are to be worn ONLY on surgical services. They are not to be worn home or into the hospital from outsid e. New scrubs must be worn daily. Surgical head and footgear is not to be worn outside of the operating room area. Failure to adhere to these standa rds of dress and grooming may result in corrective action as noted above. 5.6.6 Supe rvision of Students A student on c linical rotations must be super vised in all pati ent care situ ations. Supervision involv es a responsible licensed physi cian to: Be physically located in t he facility where patient treatment is r endered Grant authori zation of s ervices provide d by the student doc tor Examine all patients seen by the student do ctor Witness procedures when performed by the stude nt doc tor Assure that the doc ument ation in the patient's medi cal record is appropriate 5.6.7 Stude nt Problems / Issu es The Office of Clinical Affairs makes every effort to ensure all clinical rotations are positive learning experiences. H owever, if any problems/concerns arise during the clinical years, students should contact the Office of Clinical Affairs for assistance as soon as they arise. In addition, counseling services are available to all students on rotations as noted i n Section 5.7.3 of this Bulletin. If a preceptor suspects or identifies problems with a student's progress, professionalism , or performance they are to c ontact the Asso ciate Dean for Clinical Affairs. All reports will be thor oughly inve stigated and, should action be tak en, the appropriate procedures, as outlined in Section 6.7 of this Bulletin , will be followed. Examples of such problems may include, but ar e not limited to: 135 Poor interpersonal skills (i.e., personality problems, etc.); Deficient clinical skills ; Below a verage acad emic performance; Unexcused absenteeism ; Medical or psychological illness ; Suspected subst ance abuse (alcohol a nd ot her drugs); Suspected illegal behavior; or Suspected physical, s exual, or emotional a buse. If at any time, the Office of Clinical Affa irs or other faculty mem ber feels a student is unfit physically, m entally, or emotionally to care f or patients, the student will be removed from rotations and required to meet with the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs to determine t he appropriate course o f action. If a student has concerns about his/her own well -being, they should contact the O ffice of Clinic al Affairs and access CUSOM provided counseling services. 5.6.8 Letters of Recommendation The Office of Clinical Affairs does not provide letters of recommendation for students seeking post -doctoral training. Students should identify faculty members who will advocate for their suitability in the various specialties. Letters of recommendation should be forwarded directly to the Electronic Residency Application Service (ERAS). Do not have these letters sent to the Office of Clinical Affairs. CUSOM will provide the Medical Student Performance Evaluation (MSPE) as part of all student residency applications. As the name signifies, this is a standardized instrument of evaluation a nd not a letter o f recommendation. 5.6.9 Stude nt Files Student evaluations are available for rev iew acc ording to CUSOM policy. Grades cannot be given by phone. Student evaluations and gra des are maintained in the Office of C linical Affairs. Student files are CONFIDENTIAL and will not b e cop ied by personnel o f the Office o f Clinical Affairs or s ent to another party for externship/internship applications. However, students will be allowed to copy t heir own evalua tions. Student transcripts will remain under the aegis of the Registrar's Office. C omments provided by preceptors on the s tudent end- of-rotation evaluation will be included in the MSPE. 136 5.6.10 History and Physicals CUSOM believes in the importance of an ed ucationally sound policy pertaining to student performa nce of histories and phys icals (H&P' s) at affiliated tra ining sites. I deally, t he H&P policy should b e the same for all student s. However, we realize t he sove reignty of our affiliated hospitals and acknowle dge our policy must be int egrated with individual hospital policy. Ideally, the student should complete at le ast two H&P's per day on the assig ned service. Clinical preceptors shou ld critique the H&P with feedback to the student. The student should have time and the opportunity for p atient follow -up. The Office of the Director of Medical Education and Regional Dean/DSME are responsible for the H&P policy for each hospi tal. If a student has any questions or concerns regardi ng the pol icy or t heir role as a student, they should contact the Regional Dean/DSME or t he Director of Medical Education Office of the affi liated hospital. The Director of Medical Education or Regi onal Dean/DSME for each s pecific hospital will make clear to th e student the policy of the respective hospital for student order writi ng. As students are not licensed physic ians, all activities (orders, any patient care, procedures, p rogress notes, etc.) in the clinical setting are under the supervision of an attendi ng phys ician who assumes responsibility for the student. are stro ngly e ncouraged to complete str uctural examinations on a ll patients and ren der osteopathic manipulative treatment as indicated. 5.6.11 Prescription W riting Students may write o r input electronic prescription information for the preceptor, but the physician must sign/send all pre scriptions. The student's name is not to ap pear on t he prescription. F or clinical rotation sites which use electronic prescriptions, the precept or MUST l og into the sys tem under his/her own password and personally s ign and send the electroni c prescription. 5.6.12 Medical C are & Medi cation Samples Students may not seek medi cal care from a preceptor, his/he r colleagues, or staff. The o nly exception is emergency situations where the preceptor is the only qualified licens ed provi der to give care. Students may not take any medicatio n or supplies from a clinical rotation site for personal use. Any student violating these guidelines on drug samples will autom atically fail that rotation and be referred to the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Com mittee. 137 5.6.13 Heal th Insu rance Portability Student phys icians must be co gnizant of and comply with HIPAA. This will be in accordance with the traini ng institution rules and regulations and state and federal regulations as they a pply. HIPAA training will be completed by the student prior to starting clinical rotations. Any HIPAA violation will be taken very s eriously and may result in referral to the Acad emic Performan ce, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Commit tee. 5.6.14 Medi care Policy The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) revised the Medicare Claims Processing Manual in early 2018 to update policy on Evaluation and Management (E/M) documentation to allow the teaching physician to verify in the medical record any student documentation of components of E/M services rather than re- documenting the work. Students may document in the medical record. However, the teaching physician must verify in the medical record all student documenta tion or findings, including history, physical exam, and/or medical decision making. The teaching physician must personally perform (or re -perform) the physical exam and medical decision making activities of the E/M service being billed but may verify any student documentation of them in the medical record rather than re -documenting this work. Following is a link to the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), which provides direct access to CMS rules regarding student documentati on: 5.6.15 Change of Address Students must notify the Office of Clinical Affairs and the Registrar o f any change in maili ng address duri ng the clinical rotation years. This may be done via Wufoo at: https://cuweb.wufoo.com/forms/q13bwqys0t4m5h9/ Students m ay contact the Office of Clinical Affairs a t: Campbell Un iversity School of Osteopathic Medicine (CUSOM) Office of Clinic al Affairs 4350 U S Hwy CUSOM Office of Clinical Affairs will use CUSOM email as an official form of communication with students during clinical rotations. All students are required to check their CUSOM email daily i ncluding weekend/holi days while on all rotations and to respond to email requests within twenty -four (24) hours . Stude nts are asked to acknowl edge any email sent specifically to them (non-group emails) with a simple reply to ensure the email was received. If a student is located in a site with no/lim ited internet access, they must inform the Office of Clinic al Affairs im mediately. Repeated offenses for not replying to CUSOM email in a timely manner may result in a referral to the Academic Performance Prom otion and Standards (APPS) Committee for a breach in professionalism . 5.6.17 Cell Phone Calls / Text Messages It is inappropria te, unpr ofessional, and disrespectful to te xt message, ch eck social media sites or email, or u se cell phone s or any ot her devices for purposes other than educational in nature while on clinical rotations. If the precept or approves, e lectronic devices with internet capabilities may be us ed as a clinical res ource (i.e., medical applications). Students who text message or use the ir cell phone with internet access for non -educat ional purposes will be disciplined for unp rofes sional condu ct, and their behavior may also be reflected in a negative ev aluation fr om the preceptor. 5.6.18 Social Media Students may not post any p atient or rotation -specific information on social media sites (Facebook, Twitter, etc. ). Contact through we b-based social networking sites (e.g., Facebook, Twitter) should be avoided with all employees of clinical sites as well as program faculty an d staff. Career networki ng through professional sites, such as LinkedIn, is accep table. Students should NEVER post any patient -related information or commentary even if the patient name is not included. Students should avoid all perception of impropriety, such as pictures suggesti ng com promisin g states or alcohol. Violation of these gui delines may result in referral of the student to the Academic Performance Prom otion and Standards (APPS) Committee. 5.6.19 Other Regulations and Procedures The study and training of each student during assignment to a training institution shall be governed by the followi ng regulations: A licensed physician m ust supervise students. Students shall assume responsibility for and perform , their assigned duties in accordance with the training institution regulatio ns. 139 Students shall not be permitted to accept financial compensation or any form of gratuity for ren dering patient care. Students should be assigned to specific p atients. H&P exams should be completed on those patients whom students will be following on the service they are ass igned. Emphasis will b e placed on the teaching and application of osteopathic principles and practice. Palpation and structural diagnosis in the narrative form shall be an integral part of the history and phys ical examination. The student, accordi ng to the rules and regu lations of the ng institution, may sign H&P's. The H&P's p erformed and documented by stu dents must be reviewed and countersig ned by the su pervising physician. Progress no tes may be written by students only under t he direct supervision of the supervising physician and must be c ountersig ned within the time required by the rules and regu lations of the training institution. Students shall not order any examinations, tests, medications, or proce dures without consulting and obtaining the prior approval of the supervising phys ician. Students shall not write prescriptions f or medici ne, devices, or anything requiri ng the authority o f a physician. Attendance by students is required at all conferences, discussions or study session s, and any other pr ograms of an educat ional nature designed specif ically for students and should be documented with an attendance reco rd. In a ddition, students are encouraged to attend lectures for intern s and residents provided these do n ot interfere with the student's own program. Students shall be requ ired to participate in the u tilization of osteopat hic manipulative treatment when ordered and supervised by the atten ding phys ician. Students shall learn and perform procedures under appropriate and proper supervision, in those areas where the training institution regulations permit such instruction. Every eff ort should be made to counsel and assist those students having difficulty in a particular service. Stude nts who are particularly adept in a specif ic service should be given additional oppo rtunities to learn at the di scretion of the appropriate supervis ing physicians and the Director of Medical Education in accordance with hospi tal or clinic regulations. Students are to condu ct themselves in a courteo us and professional manner and shall fol low the dress co de of the training institution and CUSOM at all times . 140 5.7 Clinical Rotations Health and Wellness 5.7.1 Vaccination Record It is the responsibility of the student to have completed all vaccination requirements/records as required in the CUSOM matriculation agreement (See Section 3.16.1) . Failure to do so will jeopardize starting or ongoing participation in clinical rotations. The student will also be responsible for keeping their PPDs current according to the guidelines set forth by the CDC (within one (1) year of their last PPD). This documentation pertaining to the update must be submitted to the Office of Clinical Affairs prior to the student continuing on their rotation schedule. Inability to participate in required clinical experiences due to noncompliance with CUSOM vaccination policies may result in unexcused absences leading to failure of a course, Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee hearing, Academic Probation, Suspension, delay in graduation, or even Dismissal from the program. 5.7.2 Heal th Servi ces CUSOM students are able to utilize the Campbell University Health Center for confidential medical and confidential personal health concerns. Student Health Center office hours are published and distributed to students at the start of each academic year and may be found online at: https://www.campbell.edu/health-center/ All students are required to have health insurance at the time of matriculation and maintain health insurance coverage through graduation. Students are required to either enroll in Campbell University's health insurance plan (https://www.campbell.edu/students/student -health -insurance/ ) or provide proof of active health insurance coverage obtained through another company. Students without active health insurance coverage will not be permitted to participate in any patient care clinical activities. For medical emergencies and after -hours health care, students are encouraged to access appropriate care as warranted by their situation which may include local urgent care facilities, Eme rgency Departments , and Emergency Medical Services. In an emergency, students should access EMS and the 911- dispatch system. For students on clinical rotations away from CUSOM needing health services, assistance may be obtained anytime by contacting the Regional Dean/DSME or the CUSOM Office of Clinical Affairs. CUSOM will assume no financial responsibility for injuries (e.g., accidental needle sticks, burns, laceration, etc.) or medical/surgical problems incurred 141 eithe r on or off a clinical rotation. F or this reason, the student is required to keep enforced a health insur ance policy throug hout e very year in attendance at CUSOM. Proof of insurance information is to be provide d to the Office of Clinic al Affairs yearly and upda ted on an ongoing basis if there are any changes in coverage. 5.7.3 Counseling Services Confidential counseling services are available 24 -hours -a-day, seven -days-a- week in a confidential manner through a combination of resources which includes clinical services offered by the CUSOM Department of Behavioral Health (CUSOM BH) under the leadership of the Departmental Chair and Clinical Director (https://me dicine.campbell.edu/behavioral-health ) and StudentLinc, a stu dent assistance pro gram. Working with Academic and Student Affairs, the Director of Behavioral Health, a licensed mental health professional, and other CUSOM Behavioral Health clinical staff are available during normal business hours for direct student cont act. CUSOM Behavioral Health clinical staff are also available as a point -of-contact for after -hours issues in conjunction with StudentLinc described below. CUSOM Behavioral Health clinical staff provide counseling for CUSOM students in-person at Leon Levine Hall or via WebEx, which is a HIPAA - and FERPA -compliant telehealth platform. In addition to publication in the Academic Bulletin, students are advised of the location of this service and how to access behavioral health services during Orientation as well as per iodically throughout the year. More information regarding Behavioral Health services may be found at: https://me dicine.cam pbell.edu/behavioral-health Students on clinical rotations who are unable to travel to the on- campus locations can meet with a CUSOM Department of Behavioral Health counselor via Web Ex, a secure videoconferencing system which meets HIPAA and FERPA standards. This approach makes communication with, and counseling for, CUSOM students on rotations much more accessible and convenient. Students may also utilize video, phone , or web -based counseling through StudentLinc. Counseling is encouraged for students experiencing anxiety, academic stress, relationship problems, loneliness, depression, alcohol or substance abuse, sexuality conflicts, test anxiety , and concerns related to medical school adjustment. Students may self -refer or may be identified by and referred to CUSOM Behavioral Health by others, all in a confidential manner. 142 For students found to have needs beyond those provided via CUSOM Behavioral Health, confidential referrals are made to appropriate community health providers by CUSOM Beha vioral Health or StudentLinc, a 24/7/365 student assistance program offering wrap -around psychosocial support services. All requests for information or assistance through the StudentLinc program are free of charge and completely confidential. Services are accessed through StudentLinc's online web porta l: https://www .mystude ntlinc.com/ or via their mobile application and entering the password provided by the Department of Behavioral Health. StudentLinc Core Services include but are not limited to: Unlimited confidential tele-counseling with StudentLinc p roviders by phone , video or w eb-based chat; Five (5) sessions at no cost with community providers for an unlimited number of unrelated issue s; Crisis counseling/management; Case management and referral to community resources; Financial counseling; and Access to on line information and training repository. Students on clinical rotations may use StudentLinc or obtain information concerning Behavioral Health services within their local region through the CUSOM Office of Clinical Affairs or the local Regional Dean /Director of Student Medical Education ( DSME 's) office. Students on c linical rotations away from CUSOM needing health services are provided with site -specific or rotation -specific guidelines for accessing health care and assistan ce (for referral information) which may be obtained anytime by contacting the Regional Dean/DSME or the CUSOM Offi ce of Clinic al Affairs. If a student is seeking an accommodation for a disability under the ADA, as amended they should contact the Executive Director of Student Affairs (See Section 3.5). For emergency situations, students should call 9-1-1. For non-emergency situations Monday through Friday 9am -5pm, student should call Campus Safety and ask for the Behavioral Health practitioner. After 5pm and on weekends and holidays, student should contact StudentLinc. 143 5.7.4 Professional Li ability Insurance All students serving on curriculum -required clinical rotations are covere d by the profession al liability insurance of the Campbell University Health Center, LLC during their third and fourth years. Certificates of Insurance are provided to each clinical campus Student Medical Education Coordinator when requested . Liability insurance for third - and fourth -year students does not cover ac tivities which are unsupe rvised or performe d outside the scope of practic e or are not part of a CUSOM -approved clinical r otation. Any incidents which occur in the clinical interaction with patients must be reported to the clinical supervisor on- site, the Office of Clinical Affairs immediately , the Regional Dean /Director of Student Medical Education (DSME ), the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs, and the Campbell University General Counsel's Office at PO Box 114, Buies Creek, NC 27506, 893- 1217. 5.7.5 Policy and Proced ure Incid ents involving needle sticks and exposure to body fluids or potential blood borne pathogens require immedia te action to prot ect stu dents' h ealth and safety. If a student sustains a needle stick or is exposed to infectio us mat erials, he or she should: Imme diately wash exposure site thoroughly with soap and water (or water only for mucous me mbranes) o Wash needle stick and cuts with so ap and w ater o Flush the nose, mouth, or skin with w ater o Irrigate eyes with c lean water, saline, or sterile irrigating solutions Imme diately notify the preceptor or clinical supervisor at the rotation site for assistan ce Call/go to the Campbell University's Health Center or the occupational health clinic or area of the clinical facility designated for treating needl e stick exposur es. Time ly consultation concerni ng appropriate tests, risk-assess ment couns eling, and chemoprophylaxis decisions a re critical. Proceed immediately to the Emergency Department for evaluation if exposure has occurred a fter normal business hours or if for any other reason, u nable to be evaluated at one of the a bove locations. Seek immedia te care for necessa ry lab work and post -exposure prophylaxis if indicated. In the event that the rotation site has an existing exposure policy, the student shoul d compl y with the site's poli cy. If the rotation site is not able to assist the student, the student should seek care at the nearest available facility to provide appropriate care 144 (initial lab work for HIV, HBV, HCV, a nd risk assessment to de termine the need for chemoprophylaxis, etc.) or students may be seen at Campbell Un iversity's Health C enter. The preceptor or appropriate institution al representative should obtain consent from the so urce patient for appropriate laboratory testin g (i.e. HIV, HBV, and HCV status). Students should receive post-exposure prophylax is within hours of the exposure , rather than days, per CDC recomm endations, if the status of the sourc e patient is deemed high risk or if there is uncer tainty of the source patient's st atus. Post-exposu re prophylaxis for HIV, when indicated, is extremely time sensitive with b est results obtain ed when treatment is begun within just a few hours of exposu re. Thu s, immediate evaluation following an incident is c ritical. Some clinical sites will provide post- exposure care to students at no charge. When this is not the case, students should file a claim with their personal health insurance or Campbell University Student Health Insurance first. However, submission of insurance information should never delay an initial evaluation or in itiation of appropriate care and/or post -exposure prophylaxis. Accidental infectious exposure must also be reported to AIG : AIG Ed ucational Markets Mail Center PO Box 26050 Overland Park, KS 6622 5 Policy Numb er: CAS 9495425 When presenting to a clinic for post-exposure care, the student may provide the above polic y information and his or her student ID card. Howe ver, the site may or may not accept direct payme nt through this pl an. Students may have to pay out of pocket at the time of service. H owever, reimburs ement for s ervices up to $5,000 per incid ent can be filed via the Campbell University Hea lth Center. Students will n eed: To provide an itemized statement compl ete with diagnosis and procedure codes. Compl ete a CSAS claim form either in-person or call Campbell University Health Center at (910) 893-1560. The staff will help you fill out the form by email correspond ence. Campbell University Health Center personnel will provi de further instruction on how to compl ete and file your claim. If requested, mail documents to: Campbell Univ ersity Health C enter P.O. Box Creek, NC 27506 145 Althoug h the precept or or clinical supervisor may have contacted the CUSOM Offic e of Clinic al Affairs as indicated above , the student must also contact the CUS OM Offi ce of Clinic al Affa irs as soon a s reasonably possible. Within a minimum of seventy -two (7 2) hours of the exposure , the student must report the incid ent and then fax (910) 893-7254 a copy of the Exposure Reporting form. The incident report, Exposure Reporti ng Form - CU Health Center, shall contain: The date and time of exposure ; Clinic al site, location a nd unit infor mation ; Details of how the exposure occu rred; Details of the type and severity of the exposure ; and Details about the sourc e patient (i.e. Post -exposure management, previous vaccinations, c urrent HIV, HBV, HCV status) . The Office of Clinical Affairs will provide a copy of the incident report to the Campbell University Health Center. This will alert the Health Center in the event an accident insurance claim needs to be filed. In the event an incident report was filed at the rotation site, a copy of this must be sent to the CUSOM Office of Clinical Affairs to be maintained in the student's file. In the event of an exposure, the National Clinician's Post Exposure Prophylaxis Hotline is available by phone, ( 888) 448-4911, twenty - four hours per day, seven days per week, to provide guidance in managing exposures. 5.7.6 Infectious Dis eases Whil e all students have had thorough training in microbiolog y and infectious diseases during the first two years of the curric ulum, it is import ant to review some basic funda ment al principles. Diseases you can cat ch in the hospital or of fice include, but are not limited to : Needle sticks, and Blood and Body Fluid Exposures Hepatitis B Hepatitis C HIV Aerosol and Droplet Exposures Tuberculosis Measles Chickenpox Meningococcus Pertussis Influenza Rube lla Lassa fever SARS Transmission Streptococcus Keratoconjunc tivitis (Simple and Epidemic) Syphilis Scabies Diseases you can transmit to patients or o ther healthcare personnel: Respiratory Route Tuberculosis Influenza Measles Chickenpox Enteric Infections Gram-negative Bacilli Staphylococcus aur eus Drug Resistant Bacteria Hepatitis B Group A Strep Clostridium difficile Keratoconjunctivitis (Simple and Epidemic) 5.7.7 Important Precautions Wash Your Hands 1. Hands washed without scrub will not significantly reduce the number s resident acnes , etc.) in removing transient flora, such as gram-negative bacilli and Staphylococcus aureus. Antis eptic agents, such as chlorhexidine, are probably more effectiv e. 2. Always wash between different patients as well as between \"clean\" and \"dirty\" sites on the same patient. 3. Always wash hands and follow strict aseptic technique before inserting or manipulating any intravascular device or any other device, which will e nter a sterile body site. Observe Isolation P rocedures 1. Isolation procedures are based on a large body of scientific work and detailed guidelines are provided by the CDC : https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/guidelines/isolation/index.html 147 2. Each isolation category specifies whether gloves, gowns, masks, and/or goggles are necessary when in c lose contact with the patient or even entering the room. 3. Isolation is intended for appropriate patients whether they are alive or deceased. This also incl udes patients and specimens derived from patients. All specimens taken from isolated p atients must be designated as isolation specim ens and placed in the appropriate protective bags. The lab must be aware a specime n is from an isolation patient as body fluids can be hazardous w hen spilled, splatt ered, or aero solized in the lab. 4. There is a copy of the infection control manual and the isolation category cards in every healthcare facility. If you are sick, don' t be a vector to patients or other healthcare workers. 1. If you are ill, c onsult a physician. 2. Wear a mask if you have a respiratory illness or stay at home. Remember to follow the C USOM policy for any absences, including those related to illness, as described elsewhere in this Bulletin . 3. Practice frequent handwashi ng. 4. If you have a contagious disease or have been exposed to one, inform your supervisor and the Office of Clinical A ffairs immedia tely. Use great care when handling needles or sharp instruments 1. Never attempt to r ecap a needl e. 2. Dispose of all sharps (used or unus ed) only in the red plastic containe rs. Know where the containe r is located BEFORE using needles or sharp instrum ents. 3. Don't use needle cutters and don' t try to be nd or break needles. 4. Be careful when cleaning up after lumbar punctures , thoracen tesis, bone marrow biopsies or any other procedures in whi ch sha rps or needles were used. 5. Don't hide needles und er drapes or packaging. 6. Occasional ly while in the hospital or clinic, a student is accident ally stuck with a needl e, sharp or other potentia lly contaminate d infectious material. Shoul d this occur you should immediately follow the needle stick/exposure policy revi ewed previou sly in this Bulletin . Thoroughly clean the wound immedi ately. 8. Imme diately inform your supervisor for the particular rotation. A n incident report should be filed at the nursi ng station and a note made in the patient's chart. General Blood and Body Fluid Pr ecautions 1. Follow universal precautions for body fluid e xposure at all times. 2. Use dispos able, non-sterile gloves whenever you handle blood, urine, sputum, or other potenti ally infectious material from a ny patient. 148 HIV/AIDS 1. Both ar e increasing in incidence and prevalence in the population. 2. HIV transmission has been documented due to occupa tional exposur e but is unusua l. The risk from a needl e stick is about 1 in 300, but ac tual risk d epends on a numbe r of factors. 3. In prospective studi es of 1000 mucous memb rane or skin exposur es, there has been no document ed HIV transmission. 4. No HIV transmission has been document ed with casual contact nor with fairly intima te but not s exual or parenteral exposur e. 5. If you're pregnant, or think you are, you should follow all universal precautions. S tudents who are pregnant should consult with their obstetrician for additional guidance regarding specific precautions to take while on clinical rotations. Vaccinations Students are responsible for followi ng all CUSOM vaccination policies (See Section 3.16.1) . More detailed information can be found on the 's website: http://w ww.c dc.gov/vaccines/ adults/r ec-vac/hcw.html COVID -19 Precautions 1. Taking steps to minimize the risk of COVID -19 infections (or any other spread of disease) at CUSOM is a shared responsibility. Every member of our community must do their part. This means adhering to national, state, and local health guidelines and requirements, and adhering to those measures the university and CUSOM deem safe and appropriate for its campus including wearing masks or other facial coverings, not reporting to class if sick, and isolating and quar antining when required. a. Face mask usage inside university facilities is recommended but not required by anyone who has been fully vaccinated. Those individuals who are not fully vaccinated are required to wear a mask at all times when inside Campbell Univ ersity facilities. Face coverings are not required outdoors. Community Expectations & Policies | Campbell Ready | Campbell University b. Social distancing limitations and limitations on capacity have been lifted for the fall semester of the 2021- 2022 academic year. Classrooms, meetings, and events will return to full capacity with no social distancing requirements ; however, certain CUSOM labs and other activities may have specific requirements which will be shared with you during Orientation and in the course syllabi. 2. Due to the dynamic nature and impact of the COVID -19 pandemic, university and CUSOM COVID -related policies and requirements may change at any time as circumst ances dictate. 149 5.8 Hospital / Clinical Facility Information 5.8.1 Clinical Stud ent Prepa ration Third- and fourth-year medi cal students have all successfully compl eted two years of didactic education which prepares them for clinica l rotations. In addition to passing all require d course work, all stude nts beginning clinical rotations ha ve compl eted Check and S ubstance Abuse Scree n Students have had a background check prior to matriculating to CUSOM and again prior to clinical rotations. A subst ance abuse screen is compl eted before matriculation and again before the b eginning of the third year. Students may be required to submit to additiona l substance abuse testing again in the clinical years dependi ng on the clinica l site protocols, and any additional subst ance abuse screens will be at the student's expense. Vaccinations Before starting clinical rotations , all students are required to provide a completed medical history form and proof of vaccinations to Student Health Services. A completed physical examination form is required for students and is kept on file. Students are responsible for maintaining vaccinations required by the CUSOM in order to complete all required supervised clinical practice ex periences. All students must have provided proof of adequate vaccination /immunity for the following: 1. Diphther ia, Pertussis, Tetanus 2. Measles, Mumps, R ubella 3. Varicella 4. Hepatitis B 5. Influenza (annual vaccine) 6. Tuberculosis ( TB) skin test (twice given 2 weeks apart) using a two - step tuberculin skin test or via a single Interferon -Gamma Release Assay blood test. -- If a student has had a positive TB test, a chest x-ray report must be received as well as an annual questionnaire. 7. Unless granted an exemption (See Section 3.16.1), Campbell University and as such, CUSOM is requiring all students to either show proof of full vaccination for COVID -19 or present proof of a negative test for COVID -19 within 48 hours of returning to campus. a. To be considered fully vaccinated, students must have received the second dose in a 2- dose series, such as the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines, at least 2 weeks prior to returning to campus, or received a single -dose vaccine, such as the Johnson & Johnson's Janssen vaccine at least two weeks prior to returning to campus. 150 8. Some clinical sites require evidence of full vaccination. As such, students are required to be fully vaccinated for those specific locations. 9. Non-compliance with CUSOM Vaccination Requirements may result in the inability to participate in any clinical experiences, including, but not limited to, standardized patient OSCEs, early clinical experiences, and clinical rotations. This may result in unexcused absences leading to failure of a course or clinical rotation(s), referral to the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee, Academic Probation, Suspension, delay in graduation, or even Dismissal from the program. Annual Influenza Vaccination R equirement For your own health and safety as well as that of the patients you serve, all students are required to obtain an annual influenza vaccination. The CDC cites yearly influenza vaccinations as the first step to helping protect yourself as well as others arou nd you from contracting the influenza virus. For more information from the CDC on flu vaccin ations, please visit: https://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/healthcareworkers.htm . Proof of annual influenza vacci ne is due to the Office of Clinical Affairs no later than November 15 of each year. Certifications/Trainings All students beginning clinical rotations will have successful ly completed the followi ng certifications /trainings prior to th eir clinical Training. Credentialin g of Medi cal Students at A ffiliated Sites CUSOM works with each affiliated healthcare site to ensure proper credentialing of all medical students is completed prior to the start of the students ' scheduled clinical rotations. Credentialing ensures CUSOM assists its affiliated sites in providing the best possible clinical rotation experiences for CUSOM medical students while assisting them in maintaining the highest quality care and safety for their patients and hospital staff. 151 All CUSOM affiliated healthcare sites receive up -to-date and accurate personal information for all CUSOM medical students participating in clinical rotations at their facilities. This credentialing information ensures all CUSOM medical students are granted proper access to the facility's physician's portal, teaching faculty, clinic al areas, dining facilities, medi cal library, phy sician's lounge , and employee parking (list may vary dependin g on site). CUSOM has designated affiliate d site liaisons who work with the site's Office of Staff Developm ent or Hum an Resources depa rtment, Public Safety department, and Infor mation Technolo gy department to obtain required credenti aling forms as well as create a streamlined process f or student crede ntialing. Some of the CUSOM student used for credentialing m ay inclu de, but is not limited to : Student c lerkship a pplication ; Letter of Good Standi ng; Up-to-date Vaccination Records (to include PPD, Varicella Titer, and flu shot during flu s eason); Drug Panel Screen Results; Crimin al Background C heck R esults; Proof of Certificatio n; Proof of ACLS Certification; and Student photog raph. It is the policy of most of CUSOM's affiliate d healthcare sites that all CUSO M- generated pa perwor k (vaccination records, drug screen panel results, crimin al backg round check re sults, pr oof of BLS & ACL S) required for credenti aling is kept on file in CUS OM's Office of Clinic al Affairs. In all cases, CUSOM is able to provide this paperwork upon t he affiliate d site's request. 5.8.3 Personal H ealth Insurance All C USOM medical students are required to maintain health insurance coverage through graduation. All students must either provide proof of health insurance or purchase the health insurance available through the U niversity. Proof of insurance must be provided to the Office of Clinical Affairs on a yearly basis with ongoing updates for any change in coverage. Any medical costs incurred by students while in training, including those as a result of needle sticks or exposure to infectious diseases or materials, are the responsibility of the student and his/her health insurance carrier. 5.8.4 Hospital T raining Program Structure Students will be assigned to a patient care team comprised of physicians and residents or int erns. This structure will provide all participants with clearly delineated responsibilities for m eeting educa Administrative hospital/training site, in concert with the CUSOM Office of Clinical Affairs, will specifically define the degree of student involvement in its own institution. Standards for medical students should be consistent regardless of their school of origin. CUSOM and each participating hospital will identify the personnel involved in teaching programs, including administrative personnel. Program coordination will be through the CUSOM Office of Clinical Affairs and the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs. Program content, structure , and evaluation will be the responsibility of the appropriate departments of the hospital and approved by CUSOM. Any difficulties in the program should be immediately communicated to the CUSOM Office of Clinical Affairs. 5.8.6 Orientation At the start of clinical rotations , students will receive a hospital/clinical site orientation and compl ete all adminis trative requirements, includin g obtaining a badg er passwo rd, compl eting sary training, and additional site-specific HIPAA training, if neede d. At the beginning of the clinical rotation, it is recomme nded the precep tor and student meet to formulate mutu al goals in regar d to what they hope to achieve during the rotation. T he precept or should communic ate his/her expectations of the student durin g the rotation. The se may include topics such as : Clinical h ours; Interactions with o ffice and pr ofession al staff; General attendance; Call schedules ; Overnight/weekend schedules ; Participation during rounds and conferences; Expectations for clinical care, patient int eraction, and pr ocedures; Oral presentations ; Written doc ument ation - electronic medical record s (EMR ) and handwritten notes; Assignments a nd write-ups; and Any additional duti es necessary for learning purposes. Students will comply with all requirements related to patient care as establish ed by the hospital/ training site. The student will be introduced to the clinical service by the Regional Dean/ Director of Student Medical Education (DSME ) or Chief of the service, and will a lso be oriented to the physical plant. This m ay include, but is not limited to patient rooms, nursing stations, Emergency Departm ent, ancillary services facilities (radiolo gy, laboratory , etc.), rest rooms, lounge s, cafete ria or coffee shop, a nd library . 153 5.8.7 Stude nt Requirements The specific objectiv es are defined for core rotations in the rotation sylla bi. The followi ng must be subm itted to the Department of Clinical Affairs for a student to receive credit fo r the rotation: Student per formance evaluation ( i.e. Preceptor Evaluation of the Student ); Clinic al experience database (i.e. Patient Logs); and Site evaluation ( i.e. Student Ev aluation of Site and Preceptor). Additional requirements may be incorporated into specific rotations. The student will attend educational lectures and seminars offered at the hospital/training site. Students will be evaluated by each of the responsible individuals on the teaching servic e through periodic oral evaluation and observation of performance. Physicians on the teaching service will complete a specific evaluation form provided by CUSOM for evaluation of student performance based on the AACOM core competencies. Students will als o be evaluated on core rotations by computer -based testing at the end of the rotation. 5.8.8 Informed Patient Cons ent Regarding Stude nt Involve ment in Patient Care Patients are essential partners in this educational endeavor. Efforts must be made to observe strict confidentiality, respect patient privacy and dignity, and honor their preferences regarding treatment. Patients must be informed a student will participate in their care, and the patient's con sent must be obtained. This may be done through standardized forms at admission/ check- in or on a person- by-person basis. The students must be clearly identified as a student, wear their name badge, and verbally identify as such. If the patient requests a physician and refuses the student's services, this request must be honored. Patients must know they will see their regular provider, and they should have an explicit opportunity to decline student involvement. 5.8.9 Medical R ecords / Cha rting The responsibility given to students for medical records varies among facilities. Some sites allow students to write full progress notes and orders directly into the patient's chart. When this is allowed, notes must be immediately co -signed by the supervisin g physician , and the physician must follow with his or her own note. At no time do student notes serve as the physician preceptor's notes. Billing must be directly related to the services provided and documented by the phys ician. Some hospitals/clinics have separate pages in charts set aside for \"Student Progress Notes\" . These should also be reviewed and co- signed by the attending physician. Policies may vary at different clinical sites; students are required to follow established policy at the trainin g site. Notes are usually written in the 154 SOAP format. If dictation or computerized entry is allowed by students at a particular hospital or clinic, the resulting notes must also be reviewed and approved by the attending physician . The student is respons ible for obtaining charting instructions from the preceptor or rotation coordinator. The introduction of electronic medical records (EMRs) presents obstacles for students if they lack a password or are not fully trained in the use of a particular institution's EMR system. In these cases, students are encouraged to hand write notes , which should be reviewed by preceptors whenever possible for feedback. Hand -written notes must be maintained according to HIPPA principles and must be handled and or disposed of in a way that maintains strict patient confidentiality and conforms to the specific institution's policies. 5.8.10 Supe rvision of the Student During a student's time at the clinic or hospital, the preceptor must be available for supervision, consultation, and teaching or clearly designate an alternate preceptor. Having more than one clinical preceptor has both the potential to disrupt continuit y for the student and the advantage of exposing them to valuable variations in practice style, which can help learners develop the professional approach that best fits them. Students may also be given an assignment or be directed to spend time with ancillary staff (x - ray, lab, physical therapy, etc.) as these experiences can also be very valuable. The preceptor should be aware of the student's assigned activities at all time s. Students are not employee s of the hospitals or clinics and, therefore, work entirely unde r the p recept or's supervision. O n each rotation, it is the student's responsibi lity to ensure the sup ervising physician or preceptor also sees all of the student's patients. The preceptor can provide direct supervision of technical skills with gradually increas ed autonom y in accor danc e with the student's demonstrated level of expertise. While many CUSOM students have relatives who are physicians and may have been inspired by those family members to pursue osteopathic medicine, students may not complete rotations with a family member as the clinical faculty preceptor of record. This includes family members related by marriage or in-laws. 155 5.9 Graduate Medical Education CUSOM strives to develop and support a sufficient number of residency training positions as required by our accreditation body. The Associate Dean for Postgraduate Affairs is responsible for facilitating residency program developmen t and assisting with the strategies for placement of CUSOM graduates into graduate medical education programs. Regional Deans, who supervise third- and fourth- year student rotations at their site, also assist in the development and maintenance of residenc y training programs. CUSOM's goal is to develop the same or greater number of GME positions as our number of graduates. The C USOM GME programs provide graduating students postgraduate training opportunities and help meet the need for future physicians to care for the rural and underserved populations in North Carolina, the Southeastern United States, and the nation. 156 6. Academic Policies and Procedures 6.1 Advising and Tutoring 6.1.1 Advising and Faculty Access CUSOM believes strong academic counseling should provide students with excellent longitudinal guidance and support starting during the pre - matriculation phase and continuing through graduation. CUSOM's comprehensive academic counseling process includes a series of academic transition support activities, mentorship from assigned academic advisors, licensing exam and residency preparation, training and allocation of peer -tutors, as well as individual and group learning enrichment workshops through its Academ ic Center of Excellence (CUSOM ACE). Additionally, CUSOM's Clinical Faculty Chairs serve a critical role in advising students as they advance towards graduate medical education and the residency selection process. 6.1.2 Organizational Structure of the Academic Center of Excellence ( ACE ) CUSOM ACE, under the directorship of the two Assistant Deans for Academic Success and the support of an Administrative Assistant, is responsible for the overall success of CUSOM students. CUSOM ACE manages academic sup port programs and learning services including, but not limited to peer -tutor ing program, study skill development workshops, behavioral counseling, individual academic coaching, faculty advising support, and an on- line student forum. CUSOM ACE also hosts a collection of learning and licensing exam preparation resources accessible to the CUSOM community through its computers and library. The CUSOM ACE Blackboard community and Facebook group pages provide additional platforms for disseminating information as well as promoting collaborative academic interactions. 6.1.3 Academic Transit ion Activities CUSOM ACE is responsible for designing and leading activities and programs designed to assist matriculating students to develop study skills and techniques in achieving academic success. Two weeks prior to Orientation of the new incoming class, ACE distributes a pre -matriculation reading assignment on the topic of \"The Science and Strategies for Successful Learning and St udy.\" This material, prepared by CUSOM ACE, is a collection of highlights and excerpts from the literature pertaining to critical skills essential for academic success in a high -volume, high- paced learning environment. This material provides students wit h foundational knowledge in areas such as growth mindset, metacognition, spaced practice, interleaving learning , etc., which is then expanded upon during Orientation. During Block 1, two study skill s workshops are offered to further explore these topics with special discuss ion on test -taking skills, and exam autopsy for refining study skills. Additional academic skill s workshops are also offered at the beginning of Block 2 and Block 5 with emphases on transitioning to specific phases of the curriculum. 157 6.1.4 Long- term, Consistent Mentorship from Academic Advisors The academic Advisor -Advisee relationship is one of an institutional representative providing insight or direction to a student about academic, professional, scholarly, and career planning issues. The nature of this direction may be to inform, suggest, counsel, discipline, coach, mentor, or even teach. The CUSOM advising process ensures both biomedical science and clinical faculty are involved in student advising and establishing relationships which create an atmosphere of trust and meaningful dialogue. The Advisor -Advisee relationship will ensure consistent feedback regarding academic performance and direct the student to additional resources within the institution as needed. All advisors play an important role in identifying students experiencing academic, personal, or behavioral health problems and providing them with referrals to CUSOM ACE for individual study skill coaching or to Behavioral Health Services for assessment and appropriate treatment. The Executive Director of Student Affairs assign s academic advisors, with input and approval from the Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs , to each incoming CUSOM student. Such mentorship is typically carried out through both mandatory group and individual meetings. In the first two years, this is facilitated through desig nated time on the academic calendar fo r the advisors to meet with their advisees. The frequency of meetings between students and their advisors duri ng years 1 and 2 is as follows: During Blocks 1 and 2 of Year 1 , students meet with their academic advisors at least once individually, and once in a group setting each Block (4 meetings total). The focus of these meetings is to provide academic support to the students during this transitional period but also serve a s an opportunity to answer questions, identify student concerns or difficulties, and provide students information regarding helpful CUSOM resources and support services. During Blocks 3 -5, students are required to meet with their advisors at least once each Block in a group setting. Additional individual meetings are arranged based on student need. In addition to their role as specifically assigned academic advisors, faculty also meet with non -assigned students to provide additional help with course work. Faculty offer office hours individually and are available to students for any additional assistance. Scheduling may be done either directly with faculty, or through the appropriate administrative assistant. By matriculating at CUSOM, students agree that their grades will be shared with their faculty advisors in an effort to facilitate effective advising. 158 6.1.5 Licensing Exam and Residency Preparation Support To help guide CUSOM students in preparation and planning for national licensing exams through the National Board of Osteopathic Medical Examiners (NBOME) and the National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME), the CUSOM Vice Dean for Academic Affairs , and the Executive Director of Assessment, Accreditation , and Medical Education provide presentations to MS-1 and MS -2 students, and also offer individualized advisement. These sessions and meetings offer insights, data, and guidance for studying and scheduling COMLEX -USA Level 1 exams. As students enter thir d year, additional advising relationships are developed to support clinical rotation needs and residency specialty selection and application processes. Students are provided a list of clinical advisors/mentors identified by their areas of clinical expertise and may choose additional mentors according to their interest in a specific clinical discipline. Clinical advisors provide guidance to the students with a focus on the clinical path they are interested in pursuing. CUSOM Clinical Department Cha irs provide guidance regarding clinical rotations, addressing any issues with rotation performance , and meeting curricular requirements. The Clinical Department Chairs also provide support to students applying to residency programs in their specific or re lated fields by meeting with students to offer residency planning advice and providing letters of recommendations for s tudent residency applications. Rising fourth -year students participate in CUSOM's annual Residency Fair , designed to help students narrow down their specialty selection and to prepare for the process of applying to residency programs. The event offers a presentation on criteria to consider when selecting a specialty as well as a panel discussion including residency program directors, curr ent residents from Campbell co -sponsored postgraduate training programs, and fourth -year students in the application process. Participating students can attend breakout sessions for two different specialties, presented by that discipline's Chair, where th ey are provided information regarding the specialty (training, job opportunities/outlook, lifestyle etc.), evaluati on of their competitiveness to that specialty, and advice for that specialty's application process. Students also have the chance to talk to Program Directors and staff from residency programs directly. In the first month of their fourth year, all CUSOM medical students complete the Residency Development course, which includes several formative OSCE cases to help prepare students for the COML EX-USA Level 2 -PE. In addition, this course provides a series of lectures designed to prepare students for the residency application process with topics including specialty selection, CUSOM advising and resources, applying for residency programs, ERAS, residency program interviews, the Match and strategies for success, the SOAP process, and expectations for resident performance when entering residency. 159 Students are provided match reports from the NRMP , information related to the single accreditation system for graduate medical education, resources available through AACOM and the AAMC, curriculum vitae templates and writing support, and a residency application FAQ resource developed by CUSOM. Fourth- year students also participate in mock residency interview s during which they receive immediate feedback on their performance and specific advice regarding targeted areas for improvement in their interviewing skills. 6.1.6 Enrichment and Intervention Support from the Academic Center of Excellence (ACE) Through collaboration with the Department of Behavioral Health, CUSOM ACE assists students, directly and indirectly, to achieve academic excellence. The two Assistant Deans for Academic Success lead CUSOM ACE and provide counseling services for study skills, time management, test -taking skills, etc. directly to students in group settings or during one -on-one meetings. Individual meetings are scheduled based on need or according to the recommendation of Academic Performance, Promotion, and Standards (APPS) Committ ee or the Dean's office. Students who receive a grade of 75% or less on any integrated exam are recommended to contact their academic advisor s or CUSOM ACE for an individual meeting. Meeting frequency is tailored to individual student needs based on academic per formance, student requests, recommendations of the ACE, faculty advisors, or the APPS Committee. Students who desire individual advisi ng sessions can schedule additional meetings with their academic advisor or ACE at any time , regardless of their academic performance. Students placed on A cademic Probation per the decision of the APPS Committee may be required to maintain regular communi cation with the ACE Co-director(s), who monitor the students' academic progress closely throughout their probation period. Recommendation to seek additional support from Behavioral Health when necessary is also an integral part of this process. To maximize the effectiveness of faculty academic advisor s, CUSOM ACE also organizes and participates in faculty development sessions to facilitate discussion, share best practices, and offer useful tools for mentoring students. Beyond fostering MS -1 and MS -2 students' academic success within the CUSOM curriculum, CUSOM ACE also provides guidance and helpful resources for licensing exam preparation. Computers available through CUSOM ACE provide students protected, full access to many common Board study programs an d question banks. CUSOM ACE also has a private Facebook page, utilizing social media to deliver up -to-date information relevant to academic success to the CUSOM student community. 160 6.1.7 CUSOM Peer- Tutor Program CUSOM ACE develops and manages additional academic support services through the CUSOM Peer -Tutor program . The CUSOM Peer -Tutor program is designed to assist students requesting tutoring service to not only gain more proficien cy in subject -specific materials but also become more efficient and effective independent learners across a broad range of courses. Peer tutoring is intended to enhance, not replace lecture attendance and personal study time. Tutors also act as facilitators for student learning, assisting with clarification of lecture and lab objectives, discussions, readings, or other assignments. CUSOM ACE identifies, trains, and appoints course -specific tutors. To become a certified tutor, students must meet the minimal academic requirements (ranking the top 25% of a specific course and maintaining a cumulative GPA 3.3), complete a Tutor Training Workshop provided by the ACE, and be approved by the Course Director(s). CUSOM MS -1 and MS -2 students who wish to receive peer -tutoring support place their requests by logging onto the Blackboard Class Community and complet ing a request form provided via a Wufoo link. The Academic Center for Excellence (ACE) will identify available certified peer -tutors who will then contact the tutees directly to arrange session(s) on a short - or long- term basis. The goal of tutoring sessions is to clarify and review concepts, explain processes, and assist in problem solving. The interactions between tutor and tutee are required to adhere to the rules of academic professionalism, confidential ity, and honesty according to the CUSOM Honor Code. The most updated CUSOM Peer -Tutor Program manual is published on the ACE Blackboard Community page. As a student -centered institution, all CUSOM faculty and administrators are accessible to students whe n needed and based on availability. Administrative leadership also strives to conduct informal meetings w ith students on a regular basis. In summary, academic advisors, CUSOM Behavioral Health, the Academic Center for Excellence, faculty, Deans, and staf f are available to assist students with personal and academic problems that may arise throughout the four years of medical school, and provide guidance and/or referrals to other resources as necessary. 6.1.8 Academic Freedom Policy Faculty are entitled to full freedom in research and in the publication of the results, subject to the adequate performance of his/her other academic duties; but research for pecuniary return must be based upon an understanding with the authorities of the institution in advanc e of the acceptance of employment. Faculty are entitled to freedom in the classroom in di scussing his/her subject, but he/she should be careful not to introduce into his /her teaching controversial matter w hich has no relation to the subject. Limitations of academic freedom because of religious or other aims of the institution should be clearly stated in writing at the time of the appointment. 161 The University faculty member is a citizen and a member of a learned profession. His/her primary loyalty is to his/her institution, his/her profession, and his/her growth and development as a scholar, a person, and a teacher. He/She possesses the right, as a citizen, to speak and write, subject to special obligations arising from his/her position as an employee of the University; to be accurate, to exercise proper restraint, to show respect for the opinions of others, and to make ever y effort to indicate that in his/her role as a citizen he/she is not an institutional spokesman. Moreover, he/she should allow for the fact that many members of the general public will find it difficult to disassociate his/her utterances as a citizen from his/her institutional identification. He/ She should not use official university stationery, logos, watermarks or his/her institutional title in issuing public statements which he/she makes purely in his/her role as a citizen. Students and faculty may not represent themselves verbally, in print, or electronically (including use of Campbell University or CUSOM logos, titles, letterhead, or stationery) as representing Campbell University or CUSOM without the express written permission of the Dean. Failure to comply may result in disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal. 6.2 Assessment 6.2.1 Global Assessment Throughout the CUSOM curriculum, examinations and other assessments are administered to assess student knowledge and performance. Students are assessed to gauge satisfactory individual academic progress based on performance on written and practical examin ations, Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCEs), in the clinical setting, and performance on national osteopathic licensing examinations. The Executive Director of Assessment, Accreditation and Medical Education, the Office of Clinical Affairs, the Office of Academic Affairs (including the Registrar), as well as the Office of the Dean, work collaboratively with the Academic Performance, Promotion, and Standards Committee (APPS) Committee to determine each individual student's eligibility for pro motion or graduation, consider the results of the student assessments and reports concerning attendance, and monitor conduct and potential professionalism issues. Students who fail to make satisfactory academic progress are addressed through the processes described in this Academic Bulletin. For example, under certain circumstances, students may be brought before the Academic Performance, Promotion, and Standards (APPS) Committee for academic review or disciplinary action, with recommendations made to the Dean for final adjudication. 162 Outcome objectives have been mapped to the courses in which they are covered, and evaluation strategies are utilized to ensure that all CUSOM graduates achieve the intended learning outcomes. The CUSOM Comprehensive Assessment Plan summarizes additional methods and metrics which are tracked for continual program evaluation and improvement. Assessment of knowledge is conducted by multiple -choice examinations and quizzes administered at scheduled intervals. Laboratory, including anatomy, OMM, clinical skil ls, simulation and OSCE assessments are in written or verbal exam format. Assessment of performance on clinical rotations is by end- of-rotation examinations, preceptor evaluations and related methods. Assessment of performance compared to national cohort s occurs through the end-of-rotation COMAT exam and the Comprehensive Osteopathic Medical Licensing Examinations (COMLEX -USA Levels 1, 2 -CE, 2 -PE and 3). 6.2.2 Faculty Recusal from Assigning Student Grades Any CUSOM faculty member who is a health professional with a previous or ongoing therapeutic relationship with a CUSOM student, in any CUSOM program, must recuse herself/himself from all activities involving the summative assessment, grading, and promotion of that student. For the purposes of this policy, a \" therapeutic relationship \" occurs when a licensed clinician assumes the responsibility for the evaluation, diagnosis, or management of a student's medical or behavioral health condition. Recusal Policy If a CUSOM faculty me mber is a health professional with a previous or ongoing therapeutic relationship with a CUSOM student in any CUSOM program, they must recuse themselves as described below. Committee Meetings In the case of committee meetings, including, but not limited to, the Academic Performance, Progress and Standards (APPS) Committee, the committee Chair (or designee) will call for a declaration of any conflict of interest from committee members prior to student case discussions. Any committee member(s) identifying a potential conflict will be required to recuse themselves from both the discussion phase of the meeting as well as the decision -making process for matters in which a potential conflict exists. 163 Summative Skills Assessments In cases of summative skills assessments including, but not limited to, OMM, clinical skills, simulation, and OSCE evaluations, faculty graders with conflicts of interest must recuse themselves from the assessment and grading process. Any faculty member assigned to assess or grade the performance of a current CUSOM student with whom they have a previous or ongoing established therapeutic relationship must identify the conflict of interest to the Course Director. The Course Director wil l either assign the student assessment and/or grading to a different faculty member or perform it themselves. If the Course Director also has a potential conflict, then the Block Leader(s) will perform the assessment (or designate another qualified facult y member) and assign the grade. Final Course Grades: Blocks 1- 8 During all first- and second- year courses in preclinical Blocks 1 -8, a Course Director who has a previous or ongoing therapeutic relationship with a CUSOM student is prohibited from making a ny decisions regarding final course grade determinations for that student. In these cases, the Course Director must report the potential conflict of interest to the Block Leader(s) who will then assign the Co- Course Director to make the student's summativ e assessment or final grade determination. In cases in which there is no Co- Course Director, the Block Leader(s) will assume these responsibilities. Activities Not Prohibited b y This Policy CUSOM faculty who have previous or ongoing therapeutic relationships with a CUSOM student are permitted to provide student instruction through lectures, small group sessions, clinical skills instruction, or OMM table training. In addition, they may provide academic advising or letters of recommendation at the student's request. Clinical Rotation Evaluations and Grades During third- and fourth- year clinical rotations, supervising faculty preceptors who have an established therapeutic relationship with a current CUSOM student are not permitted to determine the end-of- rotation evaluation for that student. If a preceptor is assigned to supervise such a student for a clinical rotation, they should immediately notify the Regional Dean or Director of Student Medical Education (DSME) in the case of a Clinical Campus without a Regional Dean. The 164 Regional Dean or DSME, in consultation with the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs, may identify an alternative clinical practice or service for the student's rotation, or in cases when that is not feasible, identify another preceptor on t he rotation to complete the end- of-rotation evaluation. Policy Implementation Adherence All faculty are notified of this policy and, by signing an acknowledgement, they have read and accept the policies and procedures delineated in the CUSOM Faculty Handbook and are attesting to agreement with abiding by this policy. Each faculty member is required to acknowledge his/her review of the Faculty Handbook annually. New faculty will acknowledge reviewing the Faculty Handbook upon signing their contract, and thereafter review on an annual basis as cited previously. A s noted above, this policy wil l be reviewed at the beginning of any committee meeting regarding student academic performance in which a conflict of interest may exist. Reminders of the policy are also made at one or more scheduled Faculty and Staff Meetings annually as well as during annual performance reviews . The CUSOM Professional Development Program also includes discussions related to this topic. Compliance, however, is furthe r confirmed through assessment. Assessment of Compliance The structure of the CUSOM curriculum, and in compliance with standards related to SACSCOC instructor of record, no faculty providing a therapeutic relationship are responsible for assigni ng grades for medical students. In the pre -clinical curriculum, the Office of Assessment, Accreditation, and Medical Education manages the assessment process and reco rding of grades in all courses. In the CUSOM model, one of the Course Directors serves as the instructor of record and i s responsible for the assigning of grade s for their particular course. In this capacity, the Executive Director of Assessment, Medical Education, and Accreditation asks each Course Director during every Block if they have a therapeutic relationship with a ny of the students. If the Course Director identifies any conflicts , then feedback would be provided to the Vice Dean and in that instance a Co- Course Director or other designee appointed by the Vice Dean or Dean would be appointed to assign the grades an d act as the i nstructor of record. 165 In the clinical curriculum, the appropriate Clinical Chair or the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs acts as the instructor of record. In a case similar to described above for the situation when a Clinical Chair is asked and determined to be acting in a therapeutic relationship with a student, the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs would act as the instructor of record to assign a grade for that student. This approach ensures compliance with this standard. 6.2.3 Credits, Grading, and Grade Point Average (GPA) Credit Assignment Process The Office of Academic Affairs is charged with ensuring the appropriateness of credit assignments within the CUSOM curriculum. Corresponding credits are assigned to all courses in the curriculum, including clinical rotations, based on contact hours. Credit assignments are reviewed as described below, and the credit assignments are consistent with the definition of a credit hour as provided in the glossary of the Accreditation of Colle ges of subcommittee of the CUSOM Dean's Council ), the CUSOM Curriculum Committee, and the Campbell University Curriculum Council (UCC) have reviewed the credit assignment process and CUSOM curriculum as part of the insti tutional accreditation process. Campbell University is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC) to award associate, baccalaureate, master , and doctorate degrees. Contact the Southern Association of C olleges and Schools Commission on Colleges at 1866 Southern Lane, Decatur, Georgia 30033- 4097 or call ( 404) 679-4500 for questions about the accreditation of Campbell University. Campbell University was awarded Level VI accreditation by the SACSCOC on May 29, 2013, at which time SACSCOC approved the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO) degree program of CUSOM. The SACSCOC approval reads: \"The Boar d of Trustees of the Southern Asso ciation of Colleg es and Schools C ommission on Colleg es revie wed the materials seeking approval of the Do ctor of Osteopathic Med icine degree program. It was the decision of the Boa rd to appr ove the program and include it in the s cope of the curren t accreditation and to advance the institution to L evel VI.\" 166 Campbell University is one of only five private universities in North Carolina to be awarded Level VI accreditation status by SACSCOC. CUSOM's integrated curricular approach utilizes biomedical science and clinical faculty to explain concepts and prepare students in a logical sequence to become more clinically adept as they progress towards clinical rotations. The third - and fourth- year clinical rotations provide opportunities for in- depth clinical exposure in a variety of core and elective rotations. 6.2.3.1 CUSOM C redit Cal culation The CUSOM curriculum utilizes a process by which course grades are determined per Block of study with a designated number of weeks per Block. For the first two years of the curriculum, there are eight Blocks of study ranging from nine (9) weeks to eleven (11) weeks duration. For the third and fourth years, clinical rotations represent four -week (4) Blocks of time. Some clinical rotations may be divided into shorter time intervals, such as two (2) weeks, as approved by the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs. CUSOM assigns grades to all credit -bearing courses, and credits for each course are determined bas ed on contact hours utilizing 0.5 credit increments. A minimum number of contact hours per credit is delineated, and a course with contact hours not reaching the requirement for the next higher credit value is reported at the next lower credit value. For example, a 1.0 credit course requires 16 contact hours so a course of 10 contact hours would be assigned a value of 0.5 credit, not 1.0 credit. This credit hour calculation is consistent with US Department of Education standards. 6.2.3.2 Credit Re view Pr ocess CUSOM assigns the amount of credit awarded for student work, and the criteria utilized in this process conform to commonly accepted practices of higher education. CUSOM awards credits to course offerings based on delivery method and duration, uti lizing standards endorsed by the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admission Officers (AACRAO), as well as the minimum Federal Financial Aid regulations. Review of the curriculum, including credits, is through the CUSOM Curriculum Committe e, as well as the Campbell University Curriculum Council (UCC), as necessary. 167 To ensure appropriateness and consistency, CUSOM reviews credit assignments for the curriculum periodically as part of the curricular design review process. The process includes, but is not limited to, review of current standards of higher education, prec edent established by other Colleges/Schools of Osteopathic Medicine, and consistency with the CUSOM Missio n. The records of review of the credit assignment as part of the overall curriculum review are maintained in the Office of Academic Affairs. All proposed curricular changes, including minor and substantive changes, are brought to the Initial Review Committee (IRC), a subset of the Dean's Council , and the full Curriculum Committee for review, consideration, discussion and approval. Minor change s include such matters as the addition/elimination of a course, modifications to an existing course, or minor changes to existing program requirements. Substantive changes are those that involve extensive new patterns of requirements for existing students , or those that have a significant impact on other programs within the University. For proposed non- substantive curricular changes in years 1 and 2, with minimal impact on other programs or on student requirements, approval is required first through the B lock Leaders and Course Directors, in consultation with the Assistant Dean for Curriculum, Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs, Associate Dean for Clinical Integration, or the Vice Dean for Academic Affairs as necessary, the IRC, and finally by the Curri culum Committee. For proposed non- substantive curricular changes in years 3 and 4, with minimal impact on other programs or on student requirements, approval is required first through the Clinical Department Chairs, in consultation with the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs, Associate Dean for Clinical Integration, or the Vice Dean for Academic Affairs as necessary , the IRC, and finally by the Curriculum Committee. Upon approval at all levels, the proposed changes are then presented to the Dean for review and final approval. Any proposed substantive changes, as defined by the Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation (COCA), would follow procedures and deadlines as outlined in the COCA Accreditation of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine Accredit ation Standards and Procedures document: The COCA must be notified of all substantive change requests, which the College of Osteopathic Medicine (COM) wishes to ha ve reviewed at the n ext regularly scheduled me eting. 168 The COM must notify the COCA of its substantive change request at least six ty (60) days prior to the next regularly scheduled me eting. The COM must submit to the COCA a ll material that supports their subs tantive change request at least thirty (30) d ays prior to the next regularly scheduled meeting. Documentation required for the substantive change submis sion would be submi tted as required. COCA Substantive Change Policies and Procedures are found at: https://osteopathic.org/wp -content/uploads/2018/02/coca - substantive -change -processes.pdf The Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC) is the regional body for the accreditation of degree -granting higher education institutions in the Southern states. As such, any proposed CUSOM substantive changes also would be reported to SACSCOC per their requirements and in a timely manner. 6.2.3.3 Grading CUSOM has developed and publicized a grading system, in keeping with the CUSOM Mission , to assess the progress of each student toward acquiring the competencies essential for effective performance as an osteopathic physician . Throughout all four years of the CUSOM curriculum, students must complete all required coursework and clinical rotations with passing grades as published in this Academic Bulletin. Students who fail any part of the curriculum will be referred to the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Com mittee for review (See Section 6.7). Additionally, CUSOM maintains longitudinal records marking the career tracks, choices, and achievements of graduates in a comprehensive assessment system. This assessment includes: COMLEX -USA Level 1, COMLEX- USA Level 2 COMLEX -USA age rates; licensure; geographic area of practice; obtainment and completion of a postgraduate training program; and AOA or ABMS board certification. CUSOM publishes outcomes of student performance in annual reports to the faculty and Board of Trustees. 169 CUSOM has adopted the following schema for determining letter grades and clinical grades: Grading Scale MS-1 and and MS-4 Rotations Preceptor - Exam Grades Overall Final Grade Quality Points Other Grades A 90-100a 4.0 H-H Honor s 4.0 IC Incomplete B 80-89 3.0 H-HP Honor s 4.0 W Withdraw C 70-79 2.0 HP-HP High Pass 3.5 C*b 70 2.0 H-P High Pass 3.5 F < 70 0.0 HP-P High Pass 3.5 P 70 4.0 P-P Pass Clinical 3.0 P*b 70 2.0 PC*b Pass Clinical 2.0 FC Fail Clinical 0.0 FMP and PCC are P/F P = 4.0 QP F = 0.0 QP P* = 2.0 QP PC = Pass Clinical FC = Fail Clinical a The maximum percentage cannot ex ceed 100. Pe rcentage grades are rounded to t he tenth from 0.50 upwards, th erefore 82.50 -82.99 = 83, while 82.49 = 82. b Denotes course was passed after successful r emediation of an initial failing grade. Incomplete (IC) and Withdrew (W) do not carry any quality points. 6.2.3.4 Grade Point Average (GPA) , Quality Points A student's grade point average (GPA) is determined by dividing the total number of quality points earned by the total number of graded hours attempted. Note that for purposes of GPA calculations, a grade of \"W\" is not included in \"graded hours attempted\". If a student has earned 227 quality points on 61 graded hours attempted, the grade point average would be 227/61 = 3.721. In the first two years of the CUSOM curriculum, most courses use a traditional letter grade system (A, B, C or F) and are calculated into the GPA. In the third and fourth years of the CUSOM curriculum, all rotations have a clinical rotation grade as determined through the student's rotation evaluation, and all core rotations have clinical modules and end- of-rotation exam grades. Both the clinical rotation grade and the module portions of the rotation grade use an Honors, High Pass, Pass Clinica l, Fail Clinica l system. Successful completion of the rotation requires students to pass both the clinical rotation (preceptor evaluation) and the end -of-rotation exa m or module portions of the course. Students failing a n end-of-rotation exam have a second opportunity to pass the exam within thirty (30) days of notification. 170 If the student fails the second attempt at the post -rotation exam, an F is recorded on the module/exam grade. Students who fail a clinical rotation either due to failure of the post -rotation exam or the preceptor evaluation will be reviewed and acted upon by the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee. If the APPS Committee grants the student the opportunity to remediate the failed rotation, the entire rotation and post -rotation exam must be repeated in order to successfully remediate the rotation. No course or clinical rotation grade will be changed unless the Office of Academic Affai rs or the Office of Clinical Affairs certifies to the Registrar, in writing, an error occurred or remediation results in a grade change. A student may appeal to the Dean for consideration of a grade change only after the APPS Committee has convened and rendered their recommendation. NOTE: \"F\" grades. A student who earned a grade of F initially and is eligible to remediate the course will have the grade reported as Incomplete (IC) on his/her transcript until the prescribed remediation is attempted and a new grade is issued. The Registrar will report current IC grades to the appropriate Associate Dean at the time the IC is assigned. Once an IC grade has been officially changed to a letter grade on the transcript, the Registrar will not retain a record of IC courses as part of the academic record. Stu dents who fail to successfully remediate a grade of F will have failed the course and receive an F on the transcript. The highest grade that can be earned for a remediated course is 70%. The new grade, if remediated successfully, will have the letter gra de C or P with an asterisk (C* or P*, respectively) associated with the course to reflect a repeated course on the transcript. The grade of C* represents a remediated, passed Graded course, and a P* represents a remediated, passed Pass -Fail course. A suc cessfully remediated clinical rotation will be represented on the transcript as PC*, with the asterisk denoting a remediated clinical rotation. If remediation of a clinical rotation is failed, a grade of FC is assigned. 6.2.3.5 Quality Points Quality points are points assigned to grades in an academic \"banking\" system. CUSOM is on a four -point system. In this system, an \"A\" is worth four (4.0) points per hour, a \"P\" is worth four (4.0) points per hour, a \"B\" is worth three (3.0) points per hour, a \"C\" is worth two (2.0) points per hour, a \"C*\" or \"P*\" is worth two (2.0) points per hour, and zero (0) points awarded for \"F\" or failing grades. A student who earns an \"A\" in a three -hour course has 4.0 points per hour x 3 hours = 12 total quality points. Incomplete (IC), and Withdraw (W), do not carry any quality points. 171 6.2.4 Remediation Throughout all four years of the CUSOM curriculum, students must complete all required coursework and clinical rotations with passing grades as published in this Academic Bulletin. Students who fail any part of the curriculum are brought before the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee for review and possible disciplinary action. The APPS Committee may offer students who fail any par t of the curriculum an opportunity for remediati on (See Section 6.7) . A student in the first (MS -1) or second (MS -2) year of studies, who fails any course, will appear before the APPS Committee. If the Committee grants the student the opportunity to reme diate, the student will receive a grade of Incomplete (IC) until remediation is complete. The student will receive a grade of C* fo r a passed graded course or P* for a passed Pass/Fail course after the successful remediation of the failed course. The C* or P* will remain on the transcript with the notation that the student passed after remediation. A student will earn a grade of F if not allowed remediation or if the student fails the remediation (See Section 6.2.3.5) . A student in the third (MS -3) or fourth (MS -4) year of studies who fails a clinical rotation will appear before the APPS Committee. If the Committee grants the student the opportunity to remediate the rotation, the student will receive a grade of Incomplete (IC) until remediation is compl ete. The student will receive a PC* after the successful remediation of the failed rotation, and the PC* will appear on the transcript with the notation that the student passed the rotation after remediation. A student will earn a grade of FC if not allo wed remediation or if the student fails the remediatio n (See Section 6.2.3.5). PLEASE NOTE THAT THE OPPORTUNITY TO REMEDIATE IS NOT GUARANTEED AND IS A DECISION MADE BY THE APPS COMMITTEE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. A STUDENT MUST NOT ASSUME HE/SHE WILL BE GRANTED REMEDIATION. 6.2.5 Eval uation Categories for Years One and Two For the purposes of this Grading Policy, CUSOM recognizes four categories of evaluation modalities, including, but not limited to: 1. Integrated written e xaminations 2. Laboratory practical examinations 3. Quizzes 4. Other (e.g., SIM performance, E arly Clinical Experiences, Projects) Each category is represented within the CUSOM curriculum. A course grade can be determined by any combination of the components listed above as determined by the Course Director and approved by the Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs or Asso ciate Dean for Clinical Integration. 172 Process In an effort to promote faculty flexibility in assigning grades through assessment venues for the four categories identified above , yet also provide consistency across courses, CUSOM recognizes the following approach to testing and grading: Integrated exams typically occur three times in each Block in Years 1 & 2. Foundations of Medical Practice ( FMP), Professional Core Competencies ( PCC), OMM and Clinical Skills course questions are not inclu ded on the integra ted exams except where they are consistent with discip line content in other courses. All other courses may have questions on integrated exams. OMM and Clinical Skills have separate didactic exams, as well as their Pr actical and Lab exams, as re quired. Quizzes are typically administered each Friday morning of the MS- 1 and MS-2 curriculum. These are integrated and include questions from lect ures given in the truction days . Quizzes may be administered at other times as determined by respective faculty. Course grades are typically determined based on percentag e of total point s earn ed out of tot al points poss ible. Grades are defined by the course-grading plan approved prior to start of the course and delineated in the course syllabi . As su ch, bonus point s are not pe rmitted. In rare instances, there may be except ions to the establish ed Grading Policy, whi ch require jus tification for deviation from the original plan; however, every attempt is made to ensure the policy stated to the stude nts at the start of the course is the policy by which they will receive th eir course grades. 6.2.6 Clinical Rotations Assessment s 6.2.6.1 Didactics Students are expected to have a half -day of dedicated didactic experiences per week. This consists of: Cecil's Essentials of Medicine (based on a current schedule provided to the clinical campuses) in a Jeopardy format . 50 Studies Every Internist Should Know - The student will present one assigned landmark case and then present the current information of that case. Some students may have to present more than one study per year based on the clinical campus student cohort size. Two (2) case presentations per year based on an interesting case in which they have been involved. 173 COMBANK questions - 150 per rotation. Students will complete the questions relevant to their rotation. If they exhaust those, they can repeat those q uestions or complete questions from other topics. These are checked for completion. Regional Deans /Director of Student Medical Education (DSME's ) may add topics at their discretion, or at the request of their student cohorts, to enhance the half -day didactic experience. Noon conferences and morning reports are mandatory, if available at the respective clinical campus. Other clinical campus didactic offerings, such as Tumor Board and medical staff continuing medical education programs, may be mandated by the Regional Dean /DSME . Half-day didactic experiences are led by the third -year student cohort and facilitated by the Regional Dean /DSME . Fourth- year students are expected to attend didactic sessions at the institution in which they are completing a clinical rotation. If they are completing a rotation at a CUSOM clinical campus, they are expected to attend the half -day didactic programming and all other offered didactic experiences. Students are expected to complete all didactic surveys from the web- based evaluation system. This feedback will be used for future planning purposes. 6.2.6.2 Clinical M odules Clinical Modules including videos, lectures , and other educational materials are utilized to supplement knowledge and skill acquisition during clinical rotations. These modules are appropriate for both third - and fourth- year students and offer the learner flexibility. Modules and other educational materials supplement topics covered on clinical rotations and function as study guides for the end -of- rotation exams, COMLEX -USA Level 2 -CE, OSCE administered by CUSOM . Clinical Modules are an important supplement to a student's education, but do not replace the extensive reading, studying, patient contact, etc. students must achieve on clinical rotations. Students are provided with required curricula during the third - and fourth -years. Learning objectives and corresponding reading assignments are provide d for the core discipline r otation s. 174 Compl etion of learning modul es are due no later than 11:59 pm on the Thursday before the Call Back Friday of the rotation. In extenuating circumstances, CUSOM Clinical Chairs may grant a limited time extension to complete the modules . Five (5) points will be deducted from the student's COMAT score per day the learning modules remain incomplete. 6.2.6.3 Clinical Exp erience Database (Logs) Each student must maintain a Clinical Experience Database Log in CUSOM's web -based evaluation system so the acquisition of particular clinical skills and exposure to a broad scope of practice for each rotation can be monitored. A minimum of ten (10) procedures must be documented per rotation (with the exception of independent study electives). If the student did not observe, assist on, or perform any procedures, they are still required to submit a log form stating no procedures were observed, assisted, or performed. Failu re to maintain and submit required logs will result in an incomplete grade. Students must include all information requested on the log form. In compliance with HIPAA, no patient names or other identifiers may be included on logs. 6.2.7 Grading Rubric for Years Three and Four The primary basis for the core clinical rotation grade is the \"CUSOM Student Evaluation Form\" and the end- of-rotation exam. The end- of-rotation exam is given at the end of the four -week block for select core rotations. The CUSOM Student Evaluation Form is completed by the student's clinical faculty preceptor or that clinical campus's respective rotation clerkship director (or designee) following completion of the rotation and should be discussed with the student before submission. For rotations without an end- of-rotation exam, the student's grade is based solely on the clinical faculty's evaluation of the student. 1. Some selective and elective four-week rotations may be divided into two (2) diffe rent two-week experiences. In such cases, students will receive a grade as determined by the preceptor for each two-week experience. The overall grade for the four-week rotation will be the combi nation of the two (2) two-week experience grades. Students who fail either two-week rotation, even if the average of the two rotation evaluations results in a passing grade, will receive an FC for the entire four -week rotation block and will be cal led to the APPS Committee for re view. 2. End-of-rotation Examination End-of-rotation exams are administered after the following third - and fourth -year rotations: Medicine II, Surgery, Obstetrics/Gynecology, Family Medicine, Pediatrics, Psychiatry, and Emergency Medicine. 175 Students must pass the end- of-rotation exam to pass the rotation. Students who do not pass an end- of-rotation exam are allowed one chance to retake the exam. If the student passes the exam retake, the highest grade possible is a Pass Clinical (PC*) and they are not eligible for High Pass (HP) or Honors (H) for that clinical rotatio n. If the end- of-rotation exam is failed twice, the student will receive a failing grade for the rotation (Fail Clinical, FC) and be referred to the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee. If the APPS Committee grants the student the opportunity to remediate the failed rotation, the entire rotation and post -rotation exam must be repeated in order to successfully remediate the rotation . If the student passes the remediation, a grade of PC* is assigned. If remediation is failed, a grade of FC is assigned. 3. Completion o f Learning Modules on C linical Rotation Various clinical rota tions, including Pediatrics, Medicin e I and II , Family Medicin e, General Surgery, Obstetrics/Gynecology, and Psychiatry utilize evidenc e-based, medi cal education online modul es to suppl ement learning in an effort to uni fy the CUSOM curriculum across all of the Regional Sites. They are mand atory/required as described in the syllabi and are mon itored by the r espective CUSOM Chairs select high-yield tional modul es for the student to c ete du ring the Clin ical Rotation. Compl etion of these modules is required in order to pass the rotation and advance to the next Clinical Rotation. The student must compl ete all educational modul es to the required level of engagement which is verified by the respective Clinical Chair. Compl etion of learning modul es are due no later than 11:59 pm on the Thursday before Call Back Friday of the rotation. In extenuating circumstances, CUSOM Clinical Chairs may grant a limited time extension to complete the modules . If the learning modul es are not compl eted in the defined timeframe, the student will receive a failing grade (Fail Clinical, FC) and will be r eferred to the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Com mittee. 4. Preceptor Evaluation of the Student and Student Evaluation of the Preceptor All evaluations must be completed and submitted to the Office of Clinical Affairs within seven (7) days of completion of each rotation. Courses of eight (8) weeks duration (example: Internal Medicine) require an evaluation to be completed at the end of ea ch four -week block. I f a student has an approved 176 rotation of two (2) weeks duration, the evaluation is to be completed at the end of the two-week period. If a student does not receive a passing grade on the end-of-rotation evaluation from the preceptor, the student will fail the rotation and receive an FC grade on their transcript. Rotation grades for students who are permitted to split a four (4) week selective or elective rotation into two different two -week experiences will be the combination of the t wo, 2-week experience grades. Students who fail either two- week rotation, even if the average of the two rotation evaluations results in a passing grade, will receive an FC for the entire four -week rotation block and will be called to the APPS Committee f or review. One rotation evaluation form will be submitted and accepted per rotation. If a student worked with more than one clinical faculty member during the rotation, it is expected the clinical faculty member completing the rotation will complete a composite evaluation as designated on the evaluation form and seek feedback of the othe r teaching clinical faculty to include in the overall evaluation. Competency -based rating forms with Entrustable Professional Activity (EPA) behavioral anchors are used by preceptors to evaluate each student's clinical skills and the application of medica l knowledge in the clinical setting. A student failing a clinical rotation will be referred to the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee. Students failing a rotation may be required to repeat the failed rotation and be placed on a Modified Course of Study, which may delay the student's date of graduation. The CUSOM compet ency-based evaluation is based on the following core compet encies in e ach area: Osteopathic Philosoph y and Ost eopathic Manipul ative Medical Knowledge Patient Care Interpersonal Comm unication Skills Professionalism Practice-Based Learning and Improv ement System s-Based Practice In order to receive a grade for each rotation, the student must ensure the Student Evaluation Form, Site Ev aluation Form, end-of-rotation examination, rot ation learning modul es, and the clinical experience database (logs) are compl ete and received by the CUSOM Office of Clinical Affairs. Failure to complete any rotation requirement or submit any required rotation doc ument ation may result in a failing grade (Fail Clinical, FC) or grade of Incompl ete (IC) and referral to the AP PS committee. Items wh ich may also be used to det ermine grades on clinical rotations include but are not limited to : 177 1. Educational modules - Lectures, cases, reading assignments and other fo rms of d elivery that may be utiliz ed in the third- and fourth- year curriculum. 2. Students Logs (Procedure Logs) - Students must submit rot ation clinical patient logs and proc edure logs. 3. Question Bank Review - Students are required to compl ete COMBA NK qu estions during each clinical rot ation in order to receive c redit for the rot ation. 4. Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine - Compl etion of OMM spe cial assignments and participation in lab duri ng C all Back Fridays for core rot ations a re required. 5. Objective Structured Clinical Performance Examination (OSCE) and Standardized Patient (SP) Exercises - OSCE and SP exercises demonstr ate the student's ability to p erform clinical skills a nd to evaluate p atient pres entations for the most c ommon disorde rs found in adult a nd pediatric patients. Multi -station OSCEs will be given a t the end of fi rst, second, and third ye ars of the CUSOM c urriculum. These include taking a medi cal history, e valuating si gns and symptoms to for mulate a differential diagnosis, p erforming a physic al examination, assessing the results of diagnostic ex ams to evaluate and narrow a differe ntial diagnosis, de monstr ating the a bility to manage c ommon medi cal scenarios, and providing appropriate documentation of the patient encounter in the form of a SOAP note. OSCE, S imulation , and Clinic al Skills may also be incorporated into Call Back Fridays. 6.2.7.1 Precep tor Eval uation of Student Performance A clinical faculty preceptor or a clinical campus's respective rotation clerkship director (or designee) will evaluate a student's performance during the respective rotation. The Student Evaluation Form will be completed by supervising physicians with input from appropriate hospital staff with direct knowledge of the student's performance. During the last week of each rotation , the student must meet with the preceptor to review their performance and end of rotation evaluation. Based on the grading rubric, a grade of Honors, High Pass, Pass, or Fail Clinical for the preceptor evaluation will be submitted to the Registrar's Office. Students will have access to the electronic Student Evaluation Form (grade form), Site Evaluation Form, and procedure logs via the CUSOM web -based evaluation system. 178 Completed Student Evaluation Forms are due in the Office of Clinical Affairs within seven (7) calendar days of completion of each rotation. If the student worked with more than one clinical faculty member, the student should have the principal evaluator or the clinical campus's respective rotation clerkship director (or designee) submit a composite evaluat ion based on the input of those physicians with whom the student worked. One rotation evaluation form will be submitted and accepted per rotation. Students are not permitted to solicit additional evaluations. Evaluations of student performance must be completed by the primary evaluator who must be an attending physician. While resident physicians may provide input to aid the attending physician in completing the evaluation, residents are not permitted to serve as the primary evaluator. Students are not permitted to self -complete the evaluation and submit to the evaluator for a signature. Violation of this rule or falsification of any component of the Student Evaluation Form will be considered an Honor Code vi olation. Violation of this policy will be subject to review by the APPS Committee and may result in a rotation failure or Incomplete (IC) grade. Any Incomplete (IC) grade will jeopardize student eligibility for financial aid and may also alter/delay thei r graduation date. It is the student's responsibility to ensure all clinical evaluation forms are either completed online or submitted to the Clinical Affairs Office within seven (7) calendar days of completion of each rotation. It is the student's responsibility to expediently inform the Office of Clinical Affairs of any difficulty in obtaining an evaluation from the preceptor at the end of the rotation. Only one Student Evaluation Form from the clinical faculty preceptor (preceptor of record), primary evaluator, rotation clerkship director (or designee) will be accepted. It is expected each student will meet with the preceptor assigning the grade at the end of the rotation to review comments and to reconcile any issues, including concerns related to factual or typographical errors in the evaluation, at that time . If a stu dent does not do so, or if the student meets with the preceptor but does not bring forward any concerns at that time , the preceptor comments from the appropriate section will be used verbatim. There will be no exceptions and no option to appeal for a chan ge in the preceptor evaluation at a later date. 179 All submitted Student Evaluation Forms are final. However, if a student has met with the preceptor as required above, the student may submit a grievance related to any factual or typographical error (See S ection 6.10.2) . Any factual or typographical errors in a preceptor evaluation may be edited if approved by the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs. As such, only factual or typographical errors should be reported to the Third- or Fourth- Year Student Medi cal Education Clinical Coordinator, as appropriate. The Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs will review any requested changes of factual or typographical errors and make the determination to approve or deny the requested change(s). 6.2.7.2 Composite Evaluations As mentioned in other sections of this bulletin, it is possible to have a Student Evaluation Form filled out by a clinical campus's respective rotation clerkship director (or designee). If such a composite evaluation is completed, it is expected the author of the evaluation form will consult with other clinical faculty, nursing staff, and members of the healthcare team who interacted with the student during the clinical rotation to provide accurate and constructive feedback of the student 's overall rotation performance. Only one Student Evaluation Form from the rotation clerkship director (or designee) will be accepted. Students are not permitted to solicit additional evaluation forms from other clinical faculty on the rotation into the final evaluation form. Students who solicit additional evaluations may be brought before the APPS Committee. It is expected each student will meet with the preceptor assigning the grade at the end of the rotation to review comments and to reconcile any i ssues, including concerns related to factual or typographical errors in the evaluation, at that time . If a student does not do so, or if the student meets with the preceptor but does not bring forward any concerns at that time , the preceptor comments from the appropriate section will be used verbatim. There will be no exceptions and no option to appeal for a change in the preceptor evaluation at a later date. The overall responsibility to ensure evaluations have been completed and returned to the Office of Clinical Affairs (or clinical campus student medical education coordinator if indicated) remains with the student. For this reason, students are responsible for setting up a time to review their final evaluation with their preceptor during the last wee k of the rotation to discuss their overall performance and obtain their preceptor signature on the evaluation. 180 While the summative Student Rotation Evaluation must be completed and submitted at the end of the rotation, students are to regularly, including at the end of every week of each clinical rotation, request feedback from the preceptor, (e.g., \"How am I doing?\", \"Are there things I should improve?\") in order to continually address areas needing improvement. This provides students an opportunity to im prove any deficient areas while on the rotation and prevents an unexpected poor evaluation at the end of the rotation . It is the student's responsibility to seek ongoing feedback from their preceptor. Students should check with the Office of Clinical Aff airs (or site coordinators if directed) regularly to confirm they have received the Student Rotation Evaluation. Clinical Affairs staff may assist the student in obtaining an evaluation if a preceptor fails to complete the evaluation form or to turn it in to the Office of Clinical Affairs or clinical campus student medical education coordinator in the required timeframe. Preceptor comments from the appropriate section of the Student Rotation Evaluations will be included on the Medical Student Performance Evaluation (MSPE). 6.2.7.3 Delinquent Evaluations During the second week of the rotation, the CUSOM Third- or Fourth- Year Student Medical Education Clinical Coordinator will enter the student preceptor information provided by the clinical campus Student Medical Education Coordinator into CUSOM's web-based evaluation system. It is CUSOM's expectation the Clinical Faculty preceptor will complete the Student Rotation Evaluation at the end of the fourth week of the rotation and review it with the student to provide constructive feedback. Obtaining a Student Rotation Evaluation in a timely fashion is critical to ensure an up -to-date and accurate student academic record and transcript. At the end of the first week following a Clinical Rotation, the CUSOM Thir d- or Fourth- Year Student Medical Education Clinical Coordinator will run a report in CUSOM's web- based evaluation system to see identify any incomplete Student Rotation Evaluations. 181 These findings are reported to the corresponding student, clinical campus Student Medical Education Coordinator , and Regional Dean /DSME . The Regional Dean/DSME directly contacts the Clinical Faculty preceptor to remind him/her of the pending Rotation Evaluation. At the end of the second week following a Clinical Rotation, the CUSOM Third - or Fourth- Year Student Medical Education Clinical Coordinator will run another report in CUSOM's web- based evaluation system to identify any remaining incomplete Student Rotation Evaluations. These are communicated to the corresponding s tudent, clinical campus Student Medical Education Coordinator , Regional Dean /DSME , and Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs. The Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs, in collaboration with the Regional Dean /DSME , directly contacts the Clinical Faculty preceptor to obtain the pending Rotation Evaluation. If the Clinical Rotation Evaluation is not completed by the third week following a Clinical Rotation, the Regional Dean /DSME or a designee completes the student's evaluation. Duri ng Ro tation WEEK 1 Clinical campus Student Medical Education Coordinators (SMEC) obtain updated Clinical Faculty preceptor contact information from students. WEEK 2 CUSOM Coordinators input information provided by SMECs into CUSOM's web - based evaluation system. WEEK 3 Clinical campus SMEC match student to Clinical Faculty preceptor & email is sent at end of week notifying of rotation evaluation. WEEK 4 (Week 2 if a two-week rot ation) Student Rotation Evaluation is completed at end of week and reviewed with student. 182 Post-Rotation 6.2.7.4 Rotations, Course Remediation and Academic Probation Failure of a clinical rotation occurs if the student fails either the preceptor evaluation of the student or the end- of-rotation exam after his/her second attempt. Failure of a clinical rotation (grade of Fail Clinical, FC) for either reason will result in a referral to the APPS committee for review. If the student is permitted to r emediate, they will be required to repeat the entire rotation, including any associated modules and end- of-rotation exam, and may be placed on Academic Probation. Mandatory repeating of a clinical rotation will result in the institution of a Modified Cour se of Study, which may result in a delay of graduation and may adversely affect financial aid and the student's ability to participate in the residency match process . The student may incur additional tuition costs and fees such as re- taking the end- of-rotation exam. Additionally, the student will be responsible for paying the preceptor costs for repeating any failed rotations. These charges will be billed dire ctly to the student's account. Failure of a second clinical rotation is evidence the student is unprepared for the rigors of clinical practice and may result in dismissal from the program. Students who fail a clinical rotation for any reason will come before the APPS Committee. In addition, repeated performance evaluations in which items performed in a specific category or across categories are rated as \"1's\" or \"2's\", even if the student achieves a passing rotation grade, will be reason for remediation at WEEK 2 CUSOM Co ordinators re-run web-based evaluati on system and sends to the student, SMEC , RD/DSME and Associate Dean Faculty preceptor di rectly. WEEK 3 If Student Rotation Evaluation not complete, RD/DSME or designee will complete student's evaluation WEEK 1 CUSOM Coordin ators run CUSOM's web -based evaluation system report of incomp lete Student Rotation Evaluations and sends to the student, SMEC and Regional Dean (RD) or DSME . RD/DSME c ontacts Clinical Faculty preceptor directly 183 the discretion of the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs in consultation with the Clinical Chair, the clinical faculty preceptor, or the APPS Committee. The Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs will investigate any evaluation rating of \"2's\" or less on any competency regardless of an overall passing grade. The findings of this investigation may lead to a follow -up meeting with the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs, Regional Dean /DSME , or Clinical Chair, or result in referral to the APPS Committee. Students are expected to show a progression of improvement in performance during the course of clinical rotations. Students who fail to perform satisfactorily on clinical rotations as described above, will be referred to the APPS Committee and may result in additional required curriculum, repeat of an academic year, or dismissal from the program. Poor ratings or preceptor comments on the clinical evaluation in the professional and ethical areas of the assessment of a student are addressed by the Associate Dean for Clin ical Affairs and may result in a remediation appropriate to correct the deficient area. The Associate Dean of Clinical Affairs may refer the student for an APPS Committee hearing which will act upon this referral depending on the severity and the area of the performance measure. Poor ratings related to professional and ethical behavior area must be accompanied by comments as to the exact nature of the rating. 6.2.7.5 Academic Probation MS-3 or MS -4 students may be placed on acad emic probation f or: Failing to successful ly remedi ate an end-of-rotation examination f ailure; Failing a clinical rotation; Failing a preceptor evaluation f or any rotation; or Failing two e nd-of-rotation examination s for any two rotations. 6.2.8 Grading Policies Years 3 and 4 Questionable Evaluations: All disputes regarding grades or ambiguous evaluations will be submitted to the APPS Committee for final resolution. Failur es: A failing grade on a clinical rotation, due to either failure of an end- of-rotation examination or a failing preceptor evaluation, will be recorded as a Fail Clinical (FC) or its equivalent on the stude nt's official transcript. In addition, f ailure to complete any rotation requirement or submit any 184 required rotation documentation may result in a failing grade (Fail Clinical, FC). A student failing a clinical rotation will be referred to the APPS Committe e and if given the opportunity to remediate, will be required to repeat the clinical rotation, and may be placed into a Modi fied Course of Study which may result in delaying graduation. Additiona l consequences may apply to students who have failed a rotation as noted in Section 6.7 of this Bulletin. Further information regarding failure of clinical rotations and Modi fied Cour ses of Study may be found in Section 6.6.3 of this Bulletin. Students who fail two or more rotations may be dismis sed from CUS OM. After satisfactory completion of a remediation of a failed rotation, a Pass Clinical ( PC*) will be entered as the final grade for the rotation. Incomplete Grades: If, for any reason, a student receives an incompl ete evaluation or is unable to compl ete a rotation or its associ ated requirements (including , but not limited to, rotation logs, pr eceptor evaluations , or assigned cases), the student will receive an Incomplete (IC) for the rotation. Students are required to make up any incompl ete requirements as coordinated and approved by the Associate Dean for Clinic al Affairs. Failure to make up the requirements may constitute a failure to make acade mic progress, result in a rotation failure (FC), and may be referred to the APPS Committe e. In addition, failure to meet all third -year r otation requirements will re sult in an inabil ity for the student to be promoted to fourth- year clinical rotations. Nonatt endanc e Evaluat ions: Any student who does not report to a rotation (unless with prior approval of the Asso ciate Dean for Clinic al Affairs following the process described elsewhere in this bulletin) , will receive an autom atic Fail Clinical (FC) and will be referred to the APPS Committe e. If a student is permitted to continue in the program, they may be placed on a Modifi ed Course of Study in order to make up the rotation at a later time as designated by the APPS Com mittee or Asso ciate Dean for Clinic al Affairs. Pla cement into a Modi fied Course of Study may result in a delay in the student's graduation date and may adversely affect financial aid and the student's ability to participate in the residency match process. Additiona l information regarding attendance policies, rotation failures, referral to the APPS Committee, and Modifi ed Cour ses of Study can be found in Sections 6.4.3, 6.2.7.4, and 6.6.3 of this Bulletin. Unauthoriz ed Rotations: Any student starting an Elective or Selective rotation without prior pr oper registration with the Office of Clinical Affairs will not receive credit for that rotation, and all violations will be subject to review by the APPS Committe e. Students must obtain pre-approval for all Elective and Selective rotations to ensure all required documentation and proper affiliation agreements are in place. For questions regarding the approval process, students should contact the Student Medical Education Clinical Coordi nators f or Third -Year or Fourth- Year. 185 Rotations with Family Members: While many CUSOM students have relatives who are physicians and may have been inspired by those family members to pursue osteopathic medicine, students may not complete rotations with a family member as the clinical faculty preceptor of record. This includes family members related by marriage or in -laws. 6.3 Educational Records 6.3.1 Policy Statement on Student Information and Educational Recor ds It is the policy of CUSOM to release certain directory information of CUSOM students in compliance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA; 42 USCA 1232g, as amended). Under the provisions of this law, students in post -secondary education have the right to inspect and review their school records, as defined by law. Other than for \"Directory Information,\" see: www.campbell.e du/registrar/family-educat ion-rights-and-privacy-act-ferpa/ Campbell University will release information only with the student's written consent and/ or in compliance with federal law and regulation. The CUSOM Registrar's Office will maintain a locked fireproof cabinet in a secure, locked room for the safekeeping of all CUSOM student academic records. In addition, CUSOM has a secure, confidential, and onsite computerized record system with offsite secure network backup. All items entered into this system are retained as a part of the student's permanent record. The student's permanent record contains his/her transcript from CUSOM, transcripts and transcript evaluations from other educational agencies attended by the student, secondary school transcripts, Standardized test scores, the student's application for admission, general correspondence with the student, and if applicable, letters concerning misconduct. Upon appointment with the Registrar, a student may examine their transcript and contents of their permanent record. University officials with access to the student's educational records are the P resident, Provost, Academic Deans, Registrar, Executive Director of Student Affairs , and designees of these University officials with a legitimate educational interest in the reco rd. Campbell University guarantees each student certain rights in compliance with FERPA. Please refer to the A nnual Notification 186 There is a health and safety emergency exception which states that the institution may disclose personally identifiable information from an education record to appropriate parties including parents in connection with an emergency if knowledge of the information is necessary to protect the health and safety of the student or other individuals. More information can be found at: https://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/students.html All documents and other information concerning student academic records, student discipline, including written repriman ds, are securely maintained in a confidential file. Such actions become a part of the student's permanent education record. All disciplinary actions, with the exception of admonitions and academic warnings are required to be reported on the Medical Student Performance Evaluation (MSPE) as well as any State Medical Education Verification forms. 6.3.2 Match -State Medical Education Verification Once a stud ent participates in the Match and is placed in a residency training program , several forms must be completed and processed for licensing purposes in the state the student will be doing their residency. State Medical Education Verification forms vary from state to state. Most verifications have very specific information requeste d and CUSOM must provide complete and thorough answer s. CUSOM will be requested to complete and file another medical school education verification form throughout the alumni's lifetime with any program or residence move. 6.4 Attendance 6.4.1 Attendance Policy Attendance of first - and second- year students is expected at all lectures, and required at all labs and other scheduled curricular activities. Attendance will be monitored by the Office of Assessment, Accreditation and Medical Education (Med Ed) and electronic attendance records are maintained. Absences for emergencies are considered on a case- by-case basis through Med Ed. Any falsification of attendance records is viewed as an Honor Code violation. Failure to maintain adequate attendance during the first two years of the curriculum may result in corrective action through the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee. Attendance of third- and fourth- year students is required for all requisite clinical duties of the particular rotation on a daily basis with any structured time away from the rotation approved through the process described in the corresponding section below. Students on clinical rotatio ns are expected to be on time for all assigned activities associated with that particular rotation. Activities may 187 include, but are not limited to, lectures, rounds, hospital committee meetings, on-call assignments, case presentations, etc. St udents must abide by attendance requirements as described in Section 6.4.3 of this Bulletin Violations of the attendance requirement policy may result in disciplinary action by the APPS Committee including, but not limited to, removal from any leadership position with a student club, organization or student government office, issuance of a conduc t warning or placement on conduct probation, and possible notation of policy violations or professionalism issues in the Medical Student Performance Evaluation (MSPE). In extreme cases, absenteeism or tardiness may result in suspension or dismissal from the program. 6.4.2 MS-1 and MS-2 Years It is recognized there may be isolated instances when an individual must be absent; however, a student who misses a lecture, laboratory or workshop is not excused from the subject materials or activities of that particular session(s) . The student may be required to make -up the missed educational session(s) during off-hours. Make -up laboratories are conducted only in extreme situations and at the discretion of the Course Director in consultation with the Block Leaders, Med Ed , and Vice Dean for Academic Affairs when necessary. The total number of absences must not exceed 25% of a course. No excused absences are granted while the 25% threshold has not been reached. However, students who qualify for an excused absence will receive a one -day, 4 lecture hour allowance, per Block, not per course, to be used during the time -period noted in the excused absence request. This excused time allowance will be tracked but will not count towards their 25% threshold. A student may be eligible to request an excused absence through Med Ed by meeting one of the following qualifying criteria: For a medical co ndition/illness, the student must provide Med Ed with a note fr om the examining physician (who is NOT a f amily member) indicating the medical visit, the amount of recommended time -off, a nd the student's re turn-to-class da te. For personal leave, unless it is emergent in nature, the absence request must be submitte d at least seven (7) calendar days prior to the anticipated absence. Personal leave does not include vacations, weddings, graduations or other similar activities or events. Examples of appropriate requests for personal leave in clude: o Death in imme diate family stepparent , grandparen t, spouse, spous e's parent, child or siblin g. 188 For Jury Duty, the absence request and supporting documentation must be submitted at least seven (7) calendar days prior to the anticipated absence. For attending CUSOM -related activities or national meetings of student clubs and organizations, an excuse d absence request must be submitted, in writing, to Med Ed at least seven (7) calendar days prior to the anticipated absence(s). To be considered for such request, students must have a cumulative GPA 3.0 on a 4.0 scale, no prior course failures, and be in good academic and professional standing (not on academic or conduct warning or probation) . Students are allowed a maximum of two (2) excused absences per semester for voluntary attendance at conferences if all other excused absence criteria has been met. No travel arrangements should be made prior to approval being granted by Med Ed. CUSOM accepts no responsibility or liability for any losses as a consequence of any cancelled or delayed travel plans due to a student's failure to obtain prior approva l. Approved absences for students required to attend national conferences will not be subject the 25% absence rule; however, formal requests must be submitted for approval. Students may request an excused absence for religious holidays not included in t he list of recognized University holidays. Appropriate documentation to support the request is required, and must be submitted for approval to Med Ed. As there is no 25% allowance for mandatory laboratory (OMM, Anatomy) Clinical Skills activity, or Inte rprofessional Education (IPE) activity , a separate laboratory excused absence request must be completed and submitted to the Course Director and Med Ed for any absence from these activities . The same aforementioned criteria outlined above apply. Med Ed w ill notify the Course Director of the decision if approved. Approval must be granted and obtained in order to arrange a make- up with the Course Director. An unexcused absence from one of these activities may result in a grade of zero (0) or an overall gr ade deduction (refer to each specific course syllabus). In the event of any absence from an examination or quiz, approval must be obtained from Med Ed to arrange a make -up (approvals based upon the qualifying criteria detailed above). It is essential eac h student make every effort not to miss any examination or quiz. Requests for make -up examinations or quizzes must be made in a timely manner with Med Ed. An unexcused absence from an examination or quiz may result in a grade of zero (0) for that assessm ent. For an absence to be considered excused, students must notify Med Ed and complete the appropriate lecture or lab \"Excused Absence Request Form\" online. Med Ed will determine if the excused absence is approved or denied, and the student will be notified of the decision in a timely manner. If a student is failing any course or has been placed on Academic Probation, he/she may not 189 be approved for an excused absence unless for an extenuating situation determined on a case -by-case basis. The Vice Dean for Academic Affairs will resolve any disagreement concerning an attendance decision. Once an absence request is approved, it is the student's responsibility to contact the Course Directors and Med Ed to arrange a makeup for missed laboratories or an examination/quiz where applicable. It is important to note that, although the Course Directors will do their best to accommodate the makeup requests, some missed experiences may not be able to be replicated , and the arrangement is at the Course Directors' discretion. In the case in which a missed experience is not able to be replicated , and therefore unable to be made up, the student may receive a zero (0) for that assessment, which may lead to an overall failing course grade. Official Ho lidays CUSOM o bserves the f ollowing Univ ersity holidays. New Year 's Day Martin Luther King, Jr. Day Good Friday Memorial Day Independence Day Labor D ay Thanksgiving (2 Days) Christmas ( Varies) Holidays falling on a weekend will be observed either on the Friday before or the Monday after the holiday, or as designated by Campbell University. Please refer to the following for the current year's schedule: https://www.campbell.edu/faculty -staff/human - resources/benefits/leave/paid -holidays/ Clinical rotations are independent of this schedule - see Section 6.4.3.7. Jury Duty It is the duty of every citizen to serve on jury duty when called. If a CUSOM student is called to serve on a jury, or if a CUSOM student is ordered to appear in court as a witness, the student should submit the appropriate lecture and/or lab excused absence request as outlined above and advise the Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs as soon as possible. As noted above, in the cases of Jury Duty, the absence request and supporting documentation must be submitted to Med Ed at least seven (7) calendar days prior to the anticipated absence. 190 6.4.2.1 Cons equences of Non-compliance of Attendance Policies As professionals, students are expected to strictly adhere to the attendance policy. The APPS Committee may consider non - compliance with the Attendance Policy by MS -1 and MS -2 students as a violation of CUSOM professionalism policy which may result in disciplinary action. APPS Committee actions include, but are not limited to, loss of remedial pr ivileges; removal from any leadership position with any student club, organization, or student government office; issuance of conduct warning, placement of the student on conduct probation; and possible notation of policy violations or professionalism in t he Medical Student Performance Evaluation (MSPE). In extreme cases, absenteeism or tardiness may result in suspension or dismissal from the program. 6.4.3 MS-3 and MS -4 Years ( Clinical Rotations ) 6.4.3.1 Reporting f or Service On the first day of each rotation service, the student should report to the Regional Dean/ Director of Student Medical Education (DSME ) by no later than 8:00 am or at the time required by the Regional Dean/ DSME or the clinical department supervisor. Any questions regarding specific instructions for reporting on the first day of rotations should be directed to the regional site Student Medical Education Coordinator or the CUSOM Student Medical Education Clinic al Coordinator for Third- or Fourth- Year, as appropriate. Students are expected to bring their own basic diagnostic equipment (i.e., otoscope, ophthalmoscope, stethoscope, etc.). Students must report on time, out of respect for others' commitment to their education. Timeliness is a critical component of professionalism. Tardiness will not be accepted and will reflect negatively on both the student and CUSOM. 6.4.3.2 Wor k Ho urs Each rotation consists of approximately 160 contact hours inclusive of modules, self -directed learning, didactics, and other duties as assigned by the site. Students are required to be at their assigned supervised clinical education during all working hours , although exceptions may be granted as described below (see Section 6.4.3 .4) as indicated and determined by the training site and the physician in charge of that service, in cooperation with the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs and the Vice -President of Medical Education/Regional Dean/ Director of Student Medical Education (DSME ) of the CUSOM clinical campus . The specific days and 191 times a student is expected to report is determined by the preceptor, and students may be assigned to day, evening, night, weekend, and/or holiday work hours. Preceptors may ask students to rotate their scheduled work hours in order for the student to gain the most clinical experience during times of peak patient flow. The Campbell University holiday schedule is independent of the clinical rotation schedule. Third - and fourth- year students must follow the schedule as outlined by their preceptor for the rotation. 6.4.3.3 Training H ours Clear communication of the expectations between students, the Office of Clinical Affairs, and the training sites will permit flexibility within reasonable limits in a way which does not impact either clinical education or reflect poorly on a student's professionalism. Four (4) weeks of vacation time is included in both the third- and fourth -year as a scheduled rotation block. Students are generally expected to work an average of forty (40) hours weekly, but the exact number of days or length (hours) of required shift schedules may be different depending on the specific specialty or cl inical site. General surgery, Obstetrics/Gynecology, Hospitalist, sub- internship, and Emergency Medicine rotations frequently involve shifts outside normal weekday daytime working hours. Working hours in each of the services will be indicated and determi ned by the training site and the physician in charge of the particular service, in cooperation with the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs and the Vice- President of Medical Education/Regional Dean/ Director of Student Medical Education (DSME ) of the CUSOM clinical campus . If call, night duty, or weekend duties are required, this will be indicated by the individual rotation. The student may not substitute workday hours from one service to another and are required to remain on the clinical rotation to whic h he/she is assigned. A student may spend time in another department only if it is part of the assigned clinical rotation's curriculum and only with approval of their attending physician/clerkship director. For example, it is acceptable for a student in general surgery to spend time in pathology seeking tissue and biopsy results to ensure proper follow -up and continuity of care. It is not acceptable, however, for a student to make -up missed hours of an Obstetrics/Gynecology rotation in the Emergency Depa rtment. Any questions regarding these training hour requirements should be directed to the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs. 192 Students are not permitted to rearrange their normal working schedule to allow for time off during any rotation. The only exception may be the Emergency Medicine and inpatient Hospitalist rotations in order to accommodate shift schedules, provided it has been approved by the appropriate supervising physician. Professionalism in patient care requires reliable attendance. The Office of Clinical Affairs will centrally track the number of days off for each student. No unexcused absences can be permitted from patient care activities. As noted below, students will be given a total of three (3) discretionary days and five (5) s ick days (approved absences) per academic year. Any student in violation of attendance policies will be referred to the APPS Committee for further review. Student absence requests must be made utilizing the official CUSOM Absence Request / Submission form whic h may be obtained from the Office of Clinical Affairs or found online at: https://cuw eb.wufoo.com/forms/m63yfw91siqe 3g/ All absences, whether a current illness or a request for a future absence, must be compl eted usi ng this form. 6.4.3.4 Clinical Rotation Attendance Attendance at all scheduled workdays is mandatory. Students are expected to arrive at least fifteen (15) minutes early for each of their scheduled workdays. Any length of absence (an hour, half day, full day, etc...) must be immediately reported to the preceptor, clinical campus Student Medical Education Coordinator, Regional Dean/ Director of Student Medical Education (DSME) and the corresponding Third- or Fourth- Year Student Medical Education Clinical Coordinator in the CUSOM Office of Clinical Affairs. Requests for planned absences must be submitted electronically via the CUSOM Absence Request/Submission Form (as identified below) to the corresponding Third- or Fourth- Year Student Medical Education Clinical Coordinator. Extracurricular activities, vacations, or lack of childcare are NOT acceptable excuses for absences. 193 1. Discretionary Days Students are allowed three (3) discretionary days total annua lly. No more than one (1) day may be taken in any given clinical rotation, and discretionary days may NOT be used on a Call Back Friday (last Friday of the rotation). Discretionary days MUST be approved by both the preceptor and Office of Clinical Affairs in writing at least one (1) week in advance to the requested t ime off. Requests are to be submi tted electroni cally via the CUSOM the correspondi ng Third- or Fourth- Year Student Medical Education Clinical Coordinator . 2. Sick D ays Students are allowed five (5) sick d ays annually. If more than five (5) sick d ays total are taken in a single academic year by a student, which prevents them from meeting the requirements of one or more rotations, the student may be referred to the Office of Clinical Affairs or the AP PS Com mittee for review. If a student must miss a ny clinical time due to illness (l eaving early, arriving late, or missing a full day), they must immediately notify their preceptor, clinical campus Student Medical Education Coordinator, Regional Dean /DSME and the corresponding Third- or Fourth- Year Student Medical Education Clinical Coordinator in the CUSOM Office of Clinical Affairs . If 2-4 hours of clinical time are missed, a half day will be documented. More than four (4) hours of missed clinical time equals a full d ay of sick le ave. If the student is absent from a single rotation for two (2) days or more due to illness, the student is required to submit a note f rom a licensed healthcare provide r to the Office of Clinical Affairs defining the number of days absent and the expected d ate of return. A student may be required to make up missed days in order to meet the minimum amount of required work hours or shifts as designated by the rotation. If circumstances require a prolonged absence (more than three (3) days in one rotation), the student may be encouraged to consider a Medical Leave of Absence whi ch can be requested through the Office of Clinical Affairs in conjunction with the Office of Student Affairs . A Medical Leave of Absence may be required for students who miss more than three (3) days due to medi cal reasons and are unable to make up the missed time prior to the end of the rotation. A M edical Leave of Absence may delay the 194 student's graduation. Each case is evaluated on a case-by- case basis. Students who require a Medical Leave of Absence must follow the process described in Section 6.8 of the Academic Bulletin \"Separation from the Program\", specifically Subsection 6.8.2.3, \"Medical Leave of Absence - Absence less than 180 Calendar Days\". 3. Family Emergencies / D eath in Family Due to the variability of circumstances, time-off requested for family emergencies or a death in the family will be reviewed by the Office of Clinical Affairs on a case-by-case b asis. Students reques ting time off for family emergencies or a death in the family may be eligible to request a Personal Leave of Absence as described in Section 6.8.2.2 of the Academic Bulletin. 4. Time off for R esidency Interviews Students may request no more than four (4) days off for interviews during any four -week rotation, and no more than two (2) days over any two- week rotation. This includes partial day absences of greater than four (4) hours. A student may be required to ma ke up missed days in order to meet the minimum amount of required work hours or shifts as designated by the rotation. All requests for time -off must include written verification of the interview location and date and be provided to the Office of Clinical Affairs at least one (1) week prior to the requested date of absence. As noted previously, permission for time off for internship/residency interviews must be granted in advance with the aforementioned offices. 5. Conferences Additional excused time off for conference attendance may be granted only if the student is presenting, is a national officer, or by special permission. All requests for conferences require prior approval by the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs as noted above. Students will be required to make up missed time at the rotation director's discretion . Only students in good academic and professional standing and with an overall GPA of 3.0 or higher on a 4.0 scale at the end of the MS -2 training will be considered. 195 In addition, for students to be considered for an absence to attend a conference, they must have up- to-date submissions of all clinical rotation evaluations, site evaluations, and clinical experience database logs. Educational presentations, such as posters or research, may be considered toward meeting the required contact hours for the rotation at the discretion of the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs. Extracurricular activities, vacations, or lack of childcare are NOT acceptable excuses for absences. Email is the primary method of communication between the Department of Clinical Affairs and students, and, thus, students must check their CUSOM email regularly. Students are required to attend all onsite meetings designated by the preceptor, clinical campus Student M edical Education Coordinator or Regional Dean /DSME. Student Absence Request Requirements Student absence reque sts must be made utilizin g the official CUSOM Absence Request / Submission form and may be obtaine d from the Office of Clinical Affairs or found online a t: https://cuw eb.wufoo.com/forms/m63yfw91siqe 3g/ All absences, whether a curren t illness or a request for a future absence, must be completed using this form. There are no exceptions to this procedure and failure to follow the procedure will result in the student being assigned an unexcused absence. Students who miss more than a total of four (4) days of a 4- week rotation, or two (2) days of a 2- week rotation, regardless of the reaso n, and who are unable to make up the missed time prior to the end of the rotation, may not receive credit for the rotation and will be required to appear before the A PPS Com mittee. Failure to Provide Notification of an Absence Failure to notify the clinical site/preceptor, clinical campus Student Medical Education Coordinator, Regional Dean /DSME and the corresponding Third- or Fourth- Year Student Medical Education Clinical Coordinator in the CUSOM Office of Clinical Affairs of any absence from a 196 rotation, regardless of the reason or number of hours absent, may result in completion of a professionalism report with referral to the APPS Committee. 6.4.3.5 Make-Up Time Students must be available to make up anticipated time off at the discretion of the rotation preceptor in order to maintain compliance with the CUSOM attendance policy. If a student's excused absence results in missing an examination, the student will ret ake the exam at the discretion of the Office of Clinical Affairs. Students who miss more than a total of four (4) days of a four -week rotation, or two (2) days of a two- week rotation, regardless of the reason, and who are unable to make up the missed time prior to the end of the rotation may not receive credit for the rotation and will be required to appear before the APPS Committee. Failure to notify the clinical site/preceptor, clinical campus Student Medical Education Coordinator, Regional Dean/ Director of Student Medical Education (DSME ) and the corresponding Third- or Fourth- Year Student Medical Education Clinical Coordinator in the CUSOM Office of Clinical Affairs of any absence from a rotation, regardless of the reason or number of hours abs ent, may result in completion of a professionalism report with referral to the APPS Committee. 6.4.3.6 Call Ba ck Fridays Students are required to return to Campbell University on the last Friday of the following core clinical rotations: Family Medicin e, Medicine II, Obstetri cs/Gynecology, Pediatric s, Psychiatry, Surgery, and Em ergency Medicine. During these sessions, end-of- rotation exams are tak en, and rotation specific pr e-preparation activities occur includi ng, but not workshops; app lication; and inte rprofessional events. Full attendance and participation in the entire d ay is MANDATORY. These sessions typically are scheduled from 8am- 5pm; therefore, students should N OT make any travel plans prior to 5pm. These times m ay be subject to change. In the event of illness, BOTH the end-of-rotation exam and the rotation-specific pre-preparation activities must be compl eted in order to receive credit for compl etion of the rotation. A ny emergency requiring absence from a Call Back Friday must be 197 communicated to the corresponding Third- or Fourth- Year Student Medical Education Clinical Coordinator in the CUSOM Office of Clinical Affairs immediately. Fourth-Year Call B ack Requirements Attendance and active participation in a minimum of two (2) on - campus Call Back Friday OMM workshops is required during the fourth year. The first will occur during Residency Development Month, where the students are required to perform an OMM specific OSCE in a simulated outpatient setting. The second will occur when students return to campus to take their core emergency medicine end- of-rotation exam, and the students are required to attend an OMM workshop structured to help them develop stra tegies for integrating OMM into their post -graduate education. Students are always encouraged to attend additional Call Back Friday activities as space allows . 6.4.3.7 Holid ays While on clinical rotations, students are excused only for holidays which are observed by their respective clinical site. If a student is assigned by a preceptor to work on a holiday, the student may NOT request the use of a discretionary day on that holiday. Third - and fourth -year students are required to follow the training site (e.g., hospital, clinic, office, health center) policies and procedures regarding holidays. All major holidays are observed at the discretion of the affiliated training site and must be reported to the Office of Clinical Affairs. Students may request an excused absence for religious holidays not included in the list of recognized University holidays. If a student is required to work on a holiday, the student may be given a day off during the holiday week at the discretion of the Vice President of Medical Education/ Regional Dean/ DSME. 6.4.3.8 Consequences of Non-compliance to Attendance P olicies As professionals, students are expected to strictly adhere to the attendance policy. For third - or fourth -year students, any unexcused absence while on clinical rotation will automatically result in a failure for that rotation and the student will be referred to the APPS Committee. In extreme cases, absenteeism or tardiness may result in dismissal from the program. 198 6.4.3.9 Dismissal from Rotation Site In the event a student is asked to leave the rotation site by the preceptor or clinical site staff, the student must IMMEDI ATELY notify the Regional Dean/ Director of Student Medical Education (DSME ) and the Office of Clinical Affairs (Associate Dean for Clinic al Affairs, Director of Clinical Rotations, Stude nt Medical Education Clinic al Coordina tors for Third -Year or Fourth- Year) in person or by phone . In addition, this communi cation must be follo wed by written documentation of the events and sent to the site coordi nator and Office of Clinic al Affairs within the ensuing twenty - four (24) hours. 6.4.4 Severe Weather P olicy If inclement weather results in changes to class schedules , a message will be posted via the website at www.campbell.edu and Facebook, Twitter, and through the Campbell University inclement weather line : On cam pus: dial 5700 Local, but not on campus: dial (910) 814-5700 Long distance: 1-800-760-8980 then dial 5700 It is recommended students visit the Campbell University website at https://www.campbell.edu/alerts/ to sign up to receive campus alerts. In the event of a campus -wide emergency, a text message with information about the emergency and actions to take will be sent to all enrollees . In the case of severe weather while on clinical rotations, students should follow the severe weather protocol of their specific clinical site. If the preceptor is present, the student should make every attempt to be present. If the student is unable to get to the clinical site due to unsafe road conditions, the student must communicate this to their preceptor, their clinical campus Student Medical Education Coordinator and the Third- or Fourth- Year Student Medical Education Clinical Coordinator immediately. Any time missed due to severe weather must be made up at the discretion of the preceptor, Regional Dean /Director of Student Medical Education ( DSME ), and Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs, keeping in mind students must complete the require ments for the rotation block in order to receive credit for the rotation. 6.4.5 Emergency Preparedness Plan Section O ne - Ass essment of Risk The guiding principle behind the assessment of risk for CUSOM shall be the protection of life and safety of our students, faculty, and staff. Communication and coordination between the CUSOM Clinical Affairs Department and Regional Deans /Director of Student Medical Education (DSMEs ), will be crucial to assessing risks within our respective clinical 199 campus regions. CUSOM recognizes events affecting one region might not affect all regions due to the geographic dispersion of the clinical campuses . For events that are anticipated such as ice storms, hurricanes, or other known events, a meeting will be scheduled 4-5 days in advance of the event to include the Dean of CUSOM, Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs, Director and Assistant Director of Clinical Affairs, and Regional Deans /DSMEs to discuss the projected events and the plan for response by each Regional Dean /DSMEs. Regional Deans /DSMEs, shall be prepared to discuss their response if the event is \"Green\" which would indicate minimal impact, \"Yellow\" which would indicate a medium le vel impact, and \"Red\" which would indicate a catastrophic event. Event Category Description Green Event Minimal impact to life and prope rty in the region with expected loss of utilities to last no l onger than 1 -2 days. Yellow Ev ent Mode rate impact to life and prope rty in the region with potential loss of life and moderate damage to local structures. Uti lity failure projections of at least 3-7 days. Red Event Severe impact to life and prope rty in the region with loss of life and severe damage to loc al structures. Parts of the area are uninhabitable for weeks. Water and sewer system failure with power loss projections of greater than 7 days. Regional Deans /DSMEs will be the key point of contact for CUSOM and for its students in the respective regions and should print student contact information to keep with them until the event is over. The Regional Deans /DSMEs, or their representative, will be responsible for contacting each student in their region to make them aware of plans for response to the even t at least two (2) days in advance (if known in advance). In an unanticipated event, Regional Deans /DSMEs will have the authority to assess the risk and communicate their plans with students and CUSOM Administration. Section T wo - Co mmunication of Risk and Protection of Life and S afety CUSOM will send disaster assessment information to students providing instructions on what to do, supplies they should have on hand, and key sources of credible information during the event. The Regional Dean /DSMEs will serve as the primary point of contact for students and communicate with them directly during a disaster by email, telephone, or text message. 200 Pre-Event Commun ication with Instruct ions During Event Email, Text Messagi ng, Website and Phone Communications Section T hree - I dentification of Student Whe reabouts and Status Each clinical campus will keep a current list of student cell phone numbers and addresses in a printable format that can be taken home for reference by the Regional Dean /DSMEs in an adverse event. If electronic communication is available, a survey may be conducted online requesting student response with his/her condition, location where sheltering, and any needs he/she may have. Section F our - Returning to Clinical Rotations Regional Deans /DSMEs will communicate in advance of an adverse event with students in the region to provide specific instructions regarding when students may return to the facility. In addition, Regional Deans /DSMEs will provide students in the region information regarding any need for volunteers to assist in disaster response operations. Section Five - Educational Program Conti nuity Regio nal Deans /DSMEs in affected regions, along with the Clinical Affairs Department, will be in frequent contact to discuss relocation of affected students, when necessary, in order to ensure educational program continuity. End- of-rotation exams and Call Back Fridays may be rescheduled or alternate days may be offered depending on the impact of the event on students. Section S ix - Resources for Displaced Students In the event of a catastrophic event, CUSOM may explore arranging temporary housing and assist with other needs to the extent possible. 6.5 Dress C ode Policy Students must maintain a professional appearance and professional attire whenever on CUSOM grounds, including adjacent property at Campbell University and on all clinical experiences or rotations. Students must be professionally dressed for all lectures, examinations, laboratory classes , and workshops ; this includes all on -site and virtual sessions. 201 Men must wear appropriate business casual pants , shoes, and a collared shirt . Women are required to wear appropriate dresses or skirts of reasonable length for a professional setting (e.g., in the medical school or any clinical setting ) or slacks with appropriate blouses. Changing areas and lockers are provided for students to change into appropriate dress for OMM, Clinical Skills, and Anatomy labs. All students must have at least one short, white consultation jacket maintained in a clean and presentable condition. A clean and well -cared -for appearance should be maintained. The apparel and appearance of faculty, staff, and students project, in part, the i mage the community has of the University. Faculty, staff, and students are expected to be neat, well - groomed, and appropriately dressed for the work and study they do. The clothing selected should not be distracting to faculty, staff, or students. Short s, jeans, sweatpants, scrubs, T-shirts , and athletic shoes are not permitted except in the OMM , Clinical Skills , and Anatomy labs when appropriate. Revealing or tight, form-fitting clothing is unacce ptable. Head coverings (unless for religious reasons), caps, hoodies or sunglasses may not be worn during classes or examinations. Any student wearing a head covering (unless for religious reasons), cap, hoodie, or sunglasses will be asked to remove it. Students inappropriatel y dressed or groomed may be required to leave the campus or their clinical rotation and not return until appropriately attired. Any class, lab, or clinical rotation missed during this time will be considered an unexcused absence. Questionable or disputed cases of dress or grooming shall be presented to the Office of Student Affairs or Department of Clinical Affairs, whose decision will be final. Repeated infractions may be considered a professionalism issue resulting in referral to the APPS Committee. Certain educational experiences at CUSOM require a specific dress code. These include the laboratory classes of OMM, Anatomy, and Clinical Skills. 6.5.1 OMM Laboratory Dress Code The dress requirement in the OMM lab sessions is designed to promote learning by providing optimal access to diagnostic observation and palpatory experience. Wearing inappropriate clothing interferes with a partner's experience of diagnosis and treatment. Appropriate attire must be clean and includes any clothing that allows for easy visualization, examination, palpation, and treatment of the body areas being addressed. Avoid any heavy or thick -seamed clothing, clothing that restricts movement or visualization of the area under examination, and any inappropriately revealing clothing. Students may need to remove their shirts to reveal the back, rib cage and abdomen. Women may wear sports bras or bathing suit tops beneath their shirts or scrubs during these lab sessions. 202 Student s may wear scrubs, or other apparel approved by the Course Director, over laboratory attire when not in the role of the patient. Students must remove their shoes when serving in the role of a patient (no shoes are permitted on the tables). Hats or other head coverings (other than for religious purposes) are not permitted in the OMM lab. Religious head coverings are to be removed when they would obscure the immediate area to be examined or treated (e.g., head, neck, and upper back) and may be immediately r eplaced after this portion of OMM training. 6.5.2 Anatomy Laboratory Dress C ode Lab coats are to be worn in the anatomy lab at all times. CUSOM provides, and launders lab coats and disposable latex -free gloves. It is recommended that the student wear scrubs or old clothes and shoes that can be discarded when the gross anatomy curriculum is over. Students should w ear appropriate clothing and comfortable shoes. The lab is cool, so warm clothing is recommended. Close d-toe shoes and long pants are requi red. Flip- flops, opened -toe shoes, shorts and spaghetti -strap tops are not permitted. For ultrasound laboratories, appropriate attire must be clean and includes any clothing that allows for easy visualization, examination, and palpation of the body areas being addressed, which requires partial exposure of the body. On such days, students will be required to dress in a fashion that will allow examination of these areas (denoted as \"OMM Dress Code\"; Section 6.5.1). Avoid any heavy or thick- seamed clothing; clothing that restricts movement or visualization of the area under examination; and any inappropriately re vealing clothing. Students may need to remove their shirts to reveal the back, rib cage and abdomen. Women may wear sports bras or bathing suit tops beneath their shirts or scrubs during these lab sessions. Hats or other head coverings (other than for religious purposes) are not permitted in anatomy or ultrasound labs. In ultrasound labs, religious head coverings are to be removed when they would obscure the immediate area to be examined (e.g., head, neck, and upper back) and may be immediately replaced after this portion of ultrasound training. Lockers are available in the locker rooms adjacent to the lab where students may store their gross anatomy lab clothes. Students must provide their own locks and leave all their personal belongings in a locker instead of stacking them in the fourth -floor lobby outside the laboratory . In addition, the 203 lockers are to be used when taking a gross anatomy practical exam. Students are not to leave their personal belongings in the fourth -floor lobby. Protective eyewear is suggested but not required (students provide own eyewear). Soft contact lenses are NOT recommended in the lab (they may absorb the chemi cals used in the laboratory). 6.5.3 Clinical Skills Laboratory Dress Code Students are expected to dress appropriately for Clinical Skills laboratory exercises. Appropriate dress varies based on the activity of the day and is clearly stated in the course syllabi. Unless otherwise stated, students will adhere to the standard \"CUSOM dress code\" as outlined in this Academic Bulletin (Section 6.5) . White consultation coats are required for all Clinical Skills sessions. The laboratory sessions during Clinical Skills involve physical examination of classmates, models, and standardized patients , and students are expected to demonstrate professionalism when examining patients and classmates. The development of a professional approach is crucial. Students are required to fully participate in Clinical Skills labs which require physical examination. Randomly selected student lab partners allow for a broad range of exposure and experience diagnosing and treating patients with different body types, both male and female. No student will be required to examine, or be examined by, a classmate or faculty member for breast, genital, or rectal exams. However, there will be sessions, such as when practicing examination of the heart, lungs, abdomen, or extremities, which will require partial exposure of the body. On such days, students will be required to dress in a fashion that will allow examination of these areas (denoted as \"OMM Dress Code\"; Section 6.5.1). Ladies should wear sports bras or bathing suit tops when exposure of the thorax is needed. No short shorts, tight garments, or attire with inappropr iate slogans, are allowed in Clinical Skills Lab sessions. Lab sessions requiring \"scrubs\" are announced in advance. For all encounters with Standardized Patients, formative and evaluated sessions, white coats are required to be worn. Professional dress and a white coat are required for ALL Final OSCE Examinations. Faculty and staff reserve the right to r efuse admission to students not compl iant with the dress code as set forth in this document. Students who are not permitted to participate in a clinical skills, simulation or OSCE lab or exam due to non- adherence to the dress code will receive an unexcused absence and may b e issued a grade of zero (0 ) for any graded exercise. NO open ed-toe shoes are permitted at any time during Clinical Skills sessions. Students are permitted to wear neat, clean athletic shoes or clogs when wearing \"scrubs\" or \"OMM dress code\"; Section 6.5.1. The course syllabi may provide additional requirements. 204 6.6 Academic Standing and Progress 6.6.1 Academic Standing and Academic Progress Academic Standing is defined as a student's status at any time within a given academic Block or clinical rotation of the CUSOM curriculum. A student who is in good academic standing is one with a passing grade in all completed courses or rotations at any given point in time. This information is used in determining eligibility for students to participate in CUSOM approved activities, such as conferen ces, student organizations, etc. Students wishing to serve as officers in clubs/organizations or participat e in events, travel to meetings or other related activities must have a minimum GPA of 3.0 on a 4.0 scale to be considered. Academic Progress for students in years 1 and 2 of the curriculum requires passing all courses in all Blocks, successfully completing all curricular requirements in the Blocks, passing all components of the end- of-year testing, and meeting the requirements as set forth by the APPS Committee for students, including those in a Modified Course of Study. Students must also demonstrate adequate development in professionalism as determined by the faculty and administration. In order to be permitted to sit for C OMLEX -USA Level 1, students must achieve a passing score, as determined by CUSOM, on a CUSOM -identified Qualifying Exam. Each student must pass COMLEX -USA Level 1 in order to be promoted to full third -year status. Successful academic progress for student s in Years 3 and 4 of the curriculum includes successful completion of all rotations, end- of-rotation exams, and any other requirements, including but not limited to, clinical modules, procedure and patient logs, Call Back Fridays, and their evaluations of the site and their preceptor. In addition, students who have been placed in a Modified Course of Study must meet any requirements set forth by the APPS Committee. Each student must pass the COMLEX -USA Level 2 Cognitive Evaluation (CE) as well as the COM LEX -USA Level 2 Physical Examination (PE) prior to graduation. As of the date of this Bulletin, the NBOME and the COCA have temporarily waived the passing of COMLEX -USA Level 2 -PE as a graduation requirement for the Class of 2022. As such, to be eligible to graduate, each student must pass a summative OSCE administered by CUSOM. In order to be permitted to sit for COMLEX -USA Level 2 -CE, the student must achieve a passing score on a CUSOM -identified Qualifying Exam. 205 If a student fails to attain the passing score after three (3) attempts at the Qualifying Exam, the student will be required to successfully complete a board preparation program prescribed by CUSOM, such as Boards Boot Camp (http://www .boardsbootcamp.com ), at the student's expense and not to exceed a timeframe established b y the AP PS Committee. In order to be permitted to take COMLEX -USA Level 2 -PE, the student must successfully pass an Objective Structural Clinical Examination (OSCE) administered during Residency Development month. If the student fails to pass this OSCE, they will undergo a remediation program . Students are not r eleased to take the COMLEX-USA Level 2-PE exam until passing a remediation program and receiving approval . Students who experience difficulty successfully completing elements of the CUSOM curriculum or any level of the COMLEX examination series in a timely manner according to the academic calendar may be required to complete a board preparation program or be placed into a combination curriculum/remediation program (Modified Course of Study). Students placed in a Modified Course of Study must agree to comply with the plan as determined by the APPS Committee. As long as the student is making satisfactory progr ess in the Modified Course of Study, they will remain in full - time status. Students who do not follow the Modified Course of Study, or who do not make satisfactory academic progress while in a Modified Course of Study, may be referred to the APPS Committe e for additional required remediation, or additional sanctions up to, and including, dismissal from the program. Fourth- year students should refer to S ection 6.9.1 of this Bulletin for further information regarding graduation requirements. Students not m aking satisfactory academic progress towards graduation will be referred to the APPS Committee for review and further recommendations, which may include but is not limited to, placement on a Modified Course of Study, Academic Probation or Dismissal from th e program. 6.6.2 National Boar d (Licensing) Exa ms Students are required to pass the COMLEX -USA Level 1, COMLEX- USA Level 2 -CE, and the COMLEX -USA Level 2 -PE prior to graduation as outlined in the table of milestones below. 206 Milestones for Each CUSOM Student Successful Completion of All C ourses During Blocks 1- 8 Satisfactory Completion of a Qualifying Exam for COMLEX -USA Level 1 Successful Completion of COM LEX-USA Level 1 Successful Completion of COM AT/Equivalent Subject Examinations for Core Rotations Satisfactory Evaluation by Clinical Faculty for Each Clinical Rot ation Successful Completion of Third-Year OSCEs which Assesses Student Preparedness for the CO MLEX-USA Level 2-PE Exam Satisfactory Completion of a Qualifying Exam for COMLEX Level 2-CE Successful Completion of COM LEX-USA Level 2-CE Successful Completion of COM LEX-USA Level 2-PE or Equivalent *** *** As of the date of this Bulletin, the NBOME and the COCA have temporarily waived the passing of COMLEX -USA Level 2 -PE as a graduation requirement for the Class of 2022. As such, to be eligible to graduate, each student must pass a summative Objective Struc tured Clinical on COMLEX -USA Exams Students who want to request accommodations for any COMLEX -USA examination must submit their applications directly to the NBOME within the timeframe designated by the NBOME. Please contact the NBOME directly for more information : https://www.nbome.org CUSOM is not responsible for request ing or approving COMLEX -USA testing accommodations. 6.6.2.1 COMLEX -USA Level 1 CUSOM students complete the Clinical Applications of Biomedical Sciences (CABS) I and II courses in Blocks 5 and 8, respectively, and MUST sit for COMLEX -USA Level 1 prior to the start of Simulation Month, the first rotation of the third academic year . Prior to receiving their COMLEX -USA Level 1 scores, all students, including those on appeal for failure to complete any required coursework, may be considered \"provisional\" third- year students and allowed to participate in clinical rotations. Full third -year status is not granted until a student passes COMLEX -USA Level 1. Students are provided a course of study within Block 8 which serves as a capstone to the first two years of the curriculum and should assist in final preparation for national licensing exams. This course of study is credit -bearing and is provided by CUSOM. 207 In order to be permitted to sit for COMLEX -USA Level 1, the student must achieve a pre- identified \"passing\" score on a Qualifying Exam such as a CUSOM -proctored College of Osteopathi c Medicine Self - Assessment Exam (COMSAE) or a similar exam . CUSOM identifies the passing parameters prior to each Qualifying Exam . CUSOM pays for the first Qualifying Exam, however students may be responsible for the cost of subsequent exams or programs. Students are allowed three (3) attempts to achieve a minimum pre -identified score on the Qualifying Exam. Students are permitted to register for COMLEX -USA Level 1 prior to passing the Q ualifying E xam (QE); however, students failing to meet the minimum CUSOM pre -identified score on the QE are not permitted to take COMLEX -USA Level 1. Students who do not pass the QE after three (3) attempts , or are unable to take a QE as scheduled, are referred to the APPS Committee and placed in a Modified Course of Study, during which they will be required to complete a Boards preparation program . This online program is the Boards Boot Camp Ultra Program (http://www.boardsbootcamp.com ). This program will be at the student's expense and will not to exceed a timeframe established by the APPS Committee , unless the APPS Committee revisits the original timeline for non -compliance or some other relevant issue. A Modified Course of Study (MCOS) is a credit -bearing, individual ized study plan for students who require an alternative educational pathway for reasons such as mandated board preparation, requi red remediation, illness, leave of absence, or withdrawal . Students in a M COS must agree to , and comply with, the conditions and schedule of the M COS . Students not following the individualized plan may be placed on Suspension (ineligible for financial aid and not considered an active student) at any time. Upon successful completion of the designated board preparation course of the M COS , the student is required to take COMLEX -USA Level 1 within a timeframe established by the APPS Committee. Students assigned to a Boards preparation program must meet all program requirements, which includes, but is not limited to, strict adherence to all timelines related to the completion of study assignments and assessment examinations. Failure to do so will result in a return visit to APPS Committee with possible sanction s imposed for non -adherence to the agreed process. 208 6.6.2.2 Failure of COMLEX -USA Level 1 Any student who fails COMLEX -USA Level 1 must meet with the APPS Committee. The student will be placed on Academic Probation and subject to sanctions as described below. Students who fail COMLEX -USA Level 1 are required to complete a Boards preparation program prescribed by CUSOM, such as, but not limited to, Boards Boot Camp ( http://www.boardsbootcamp.com ), at the student's expense and within a timeframe established by the APPS Committee. This requires the student to enter a Modified Course of Study (MCOS). A student w ho fails COMLEX -USA Level 1 on their first attempt, but has already completed a CUSOM -approved or designated Boards preparation program prior to taking COMLEX -USA Level 1, may be placed on Suspension (ineligible for financial aid and not an active student) or be required to complete a different preparation program prescribed by CUSOM, such as, but not limited to the PASS Program (https://www.pass -program.com/ ). Part icipation in the required preparation program will be at the student's expense and must be completed within a timeframe established by the APPS Committee. This requires the student to enter a MCOS . If the student is already on a MCOS , adjustments to the MCOS may be required. In either case, a MCOS may result in a delay in the completion of program requirements and graduation, which may in turn affect their ability to participate in the residency match process. Upon successful comple tion of the remedial program, the student is required to retake COMLEX -USA Level 1 for the second attempt within a timeframe established by the APPS Committee. Any student who fails COMLEX -USA Level 1 a second time must again meet with the APPS Committee. The student may be placed on Suspension (ineligible for financial aid and not an active student) or be required to complete a boards preparation program prescribed by CUSOM, such as, but not limited to, the PASS Program (https://www.pass -program.com/ ) at the student's expense and within a time frame established by the APPS Committee. This requires the student to enter a MCOS . If the student is already on a M COS , adjustments to the MCOS may be required. In either case, a M COS may result in a delay in the completion of program requirements and graduation, which may in turn affect their ability to participate in the residency match process. Upon successful completi on of the remedial program, the student is required to retake COMLEX -USA Level 1 for the third, and final, time within a time frame designated by the APPS Committee. A student is permitted only three (3) attempts to pass COMLEX -USA Level 1, after which they will be dismissed from the program. 209 Students who have been removed from clinical rotations for a COMLEX -USA Level 1 failure may be permitted to return to clinical rotations following their retaking of the exam, while waiting for release of their COMLE X-USA Level 1 score. COMLEX -USA Level 2-PE -year students must take and pass an end- of-rotation exam after each core rotation. In addition to demonstrating the student has learned the appropriate material on the rotation, the se exams function to prepare students for COMLEX -USA Level 2 -CE. In addition, at the end of the third year students must take and pass Standardized Patient (SP) Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) exams. These exams are administ ered to assure the student has competently achieved the clinical skills expected in the third year and to prepare the student for COMLEX -USA Level 2 -PE testing. Students must schedule their COMLEX -USA Level 2 -CE no later than March 15 of the MS -3 year and take the exam no later than November 1 of the MS -4 year unless otherwise approved. In order to sit for COMLEX -USA Level 2 -CE, the student must achieve a passing score as determined by CUSOM on a Qualifying Exam (QE), such as a CUSOM -proctored College of Osteopathic Medicine Self -Assessment Exam (COMSAE) or a similar exam. CUSOM identifies the passing parameters for this exam and pays for the first Q E, with students responsible for the cost of subsequent exams. Students are permitted to register for COML EX-USA Level 2-CE prior to passing the Q E; however, students failing to meet the minimum CUSOM pre -identified score on three (3) consecutive attempts are not permitted to take COMLEX -USA Level 2 -CE. Students who do not pass the QE after three (3) consecutive attempts are referred to the APPS Committee and the student will be required to complete a Boards preparation program . This online program is the Boards Boot Camp Ultra Program (http://www.boardsbootcamp.com ). This program will be at the student's expense and will not to exceed a timeframe established by the APPS Committee, unless the APPS Committee revisits the original timeline for non -compliance or some other relevant issue. The APPS Comm ittee may recommend a student be removed from clinical rotations while completing a Boards preparation program. Students assigned to a Boards preparation program must meet all program requirements, which includes, but is not limited to, stric t adherence to all timelines related to the completion of study assignments and assessment examinations. Failure to do so will 210 result in a return visit to APPS Committee with possible sanctions imposed for non -adherence to the agreed process . In order to be permitted to take COMLEX -USA Level 2 -PE, the student must successfully pass an Objective Structural Clinical Examination (OSCE) administered during Residency Development month. If the student fails to pass this OSCE, they will undergo a remediation pr ogram. Students are not r eleased to take the COMLEX-USA Level 2-PE exam until passing a remediation program and receiving approval . Students who fail the OSCE exam are required to successfully complete the designated remediation program a minimum of fourteen (14) days prior to taking COMLEX -USA Level 2 -PE. Students who do not successfully remediate will have their COMLEX -USA Level 2-PE release withdrawn. Students are required to take COMLEX -USA Level 2 -PE by October 1 in their fourth year. As it ta kes a minimum of ninety (90) days to receive scores for COMLEX -USA Level 2 -PE, it may be to the student's advantage to take this exam earlier in order to provide the student with ample time to retake the exam and qualify for the Match prior to graduation i n the case the student do es not pass the exam. Passing both COMLEX -USA Level 2 -CE and COMLEX -USA Level 2-PE is required to graduate. In addition, most residency programs require students to pass COMLEX - USA Level 2 -CE to match with their program. Some r esidency programs also require proof of passing COMLEX -USA Level 2 -PE prior to interviewing with their program. As of the date of this Bulletin, the NBOME and the COCA have temporarily waived the passing of COMLEX -USA Level 2 -PE as a graduation requirement for the Class of 2022. As such, to be eligible to graduate, each student must pass a summative OSCE administered by CUSOM. The student must report to the Office of Clinical Affairs when National Board examinations will be taken (please see be low). For time off, (e.g., National Boards) the clinical faculty preceptor, Regional Dean/ Director of Student Medical Education ( DSME ), and Regional Site Student Medical Education Coordinator will be notified, and the student will not be required to work nor make up the time missed. Eligible students shall be granted permission to be absent from their clinical service in order to take the COMLEX -USA examination (one (1) day). If not administered locally, adequate travel time (one (1) day 211 before) will be permitted. Students must provide notice to their clinical faculty preceptor, Regional Dean/DSME (if at a core CUSOM training site), and the Office of Clinical Affairs at least two (2) weeks in advance of their scheduled examination date. Students are exp ected to report to their rotation in the usual manner, the day after the examination day, unless travel exceeds 200 miles. Dates for COMLEX -USA Examinations can be found at this website: .4 Level 2-PE Any either -USA Level 2-CE or COMLEX -USA Level 2 -PE must meet with the APPS Committee. The student will be placed on Academic Probation and subject to sanctions as described below. Any student who fails the student initial attempt on COMLEX -USA Level 2 -CE will be immediately placed on Academic Probation and, as determined by th e APPS Committee, will be withdrawn from clinical rotations until the student successfully passes the exam. Any student who fails COMLEX -USA Level 2 -CE must meet with the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs and the APPS Committee within seven (7) days of receiving a failing score. Students who fail COMLEX -USA Level 2 -CE will be required to complete a remedial program prescribed by CUSOM, such as, but not limited to, Boards Boot Camp ( http://www.boardsbootcamp.com ), at the student's expense and within a time frame established by the APPS Committee. Upon successful completion of the remedial program, the student will be required to retake COMLEX -USA Level 2 -CE within a timeframe established by the APPS Committe e. Students assigned to a Boards preparation program must meet all program requirements, which includes, but is not limited to, strict adherence to all timelines related to the completion of study assignments and assessment examinations. Failure to do so will result in a return visit to APPS Committee with possible sanctions imposed for non -adherence to the agreed process. Students who have been removed from clinical rotations due to a COMLEX -USA Level 2 -CE failure are placed in a Modified Course of Study (MCOS) and may be permitted to return to clinical rotations following their retaking of the exam while waiting for release of their COMLEX -USA Level 2 -CE score by the NBOME. Students who are unsuccessful on the second attempt of the COMLEX -USA Level 2- CE will be referred to the APPS Committee and may be placed on Suspension (ineligible for financial aid). Students are not removed 212 from Suspension until they demonstrate a passing score on the deficient exam(s). Students on Suspension for a period exc eeding six (6) months will be reviewed by the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee and are subject to dismissal from the program. A student is permitted only three (3) attempts to pass COMLEX -USA Level 2 -CE, after which the stude nt will be dismissed from the program. A MCOS is individually designed based upon the student's performance and needs by the respective Asso ciate Dean and approve d by the APPS Com mittee. Students in a MCOS must agree to and compl y with the conditions and schedule of the MCOS . Students not follo wing the MCOS m ay be placed on Suspension (thus ineligible for financial aid and not c onside red an active student) at any time. Students must pass COMLEX -USA Level 1, COMLEX- USA Level 2-CE and COMLEX -USA Level 2-PE in order to meet graduation requirements. Students are allowed a maximum of three (3) attempts to pass each of these exams. Failure to pass any of these exams during the required timeframe will result in a referral to the APPS Committee and will res ult in dismissal from the program. As of the date of this Bulletin, the NBOME and the COCA have temporarily waived the passing of COMLEX -USA Level 2 -PE as a graduation requirement for the Class of 2022. As such, to be eligible to graduate, each student m ust pass a summative Objective Structured Clinical Examination ( OSCE ) administered by CUSOM. 6.6.3 Modified Course of Study A Modified Course of Study (MCOS) is a credit -bearing, individualized study plan for students who require an alternative educational pathway for reasons such as mandated board preparation, required remediation, illness, leave of absence, or withdrawal . A MCOS is not intended to provide extra time to prepare for licensing examinations simply because a student would like more time to study and prepare for these examinations. Students do not choose to enter a MOCS; rather, students are required to offer a rationale for why an MCOS should be granted by the APPS Committee . The MCOS will be individually designed based upon the student's performance and needs by the respective Associate Dean and approved by the APPS Committee . Students in a MCOS must agree to, and comply with, the conditions and schedule of the MCOS . Students not following the MCOS may be placed on Suspension (ineligible for financial aid and not considered an active student) at any time. 213 During clinical rotations, students following a MCOS should be aware that they must complete all program requirements to graduate, enter ERAS (Electronic Residency Application Service) and participate in the Match. Students who fail COMLEX Level 2 -PE or COMLEX Level 2 -CE after the Match may lose their matched position. In addition, students who fail to meet their graduation requirements i n adequate time to start their residency program may also lose their matched position. These decisions are made by the Residency Program Director or Director of Medical Education at the respective hospital. A student in a MCOS who does not adhere to the requirements and parameters of the MCOS, including but not limited to, not following directions of an assigned program such as Boards Boot Camp or the PASS Program, may be referred to the APPS Committee for further action and may be placed on S uspension. 6.7 Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee The APPS Committee, in conjunction with the Office of Academic Affairs, monitors the academic progress achieved by all students throughout the entire CUSOM academic program. Additionally, the APPS Committee is responsible for the review of situations where students are involved in academic misconduct (i.e., cheating or plagiarism), non- academic violations of the Honor Code or Code of Misconduct, unprofessional conduct, or grievances . Additional information regarding these violations and procedures is found in this Bulletin at Sections 6.7.3 Honor Code , 6.7.4 Code of Misconduct , and 6.10 Grievance Processes. The APPS Committee is appointed by the Dean, and membership may be subject to change at any time. The Registrar and Executive Director of Student Affairs participate as voting members. A quorum is defined as a simple majority of the members. The committee Chair, with approval of the Dean, m ay invite non- voting members to attend. APPS Committee meetings are considered academic proceedings and not legal hearings, neither attorneys nor other representatives (e.g. healthcare providers) are allowed. 6.7.1 Procedures for Calling and Conducting an APPS Committee Meeting Regarding Academic Matters The APPS Committee meets at the end of any Block or clinical rotation after the Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs or the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs have determined all grades : (i) to review students who have achieved a failing course or clinical rotation grade, or failed to successfully remediate a failed course, (ii) when a delay in a student's academic progress is identified, or (iii) when deemed necessary. 214 The Chair of the APP S Committee or the appropriate Associate Dean for the academic year involved may also call a meeting of the APPS Committee in cases where the academic progress of a student is affected by a leave of absence or other factors. Students cannot request a meet ing of the APPS Committee to challenge or appeal an APPS Committee decision; appeals are handled through the Dean as outlined in Section 6.7.8 or through the Grievance procedures outlined in Section 6.10 of this Academic Bulletin. Reasons for an APPS Comm ittee hearing include, but are not limited to , if a student has: Failed a course; Attempted and failed to remediate a course; Failed to pa ss any course while on Acad emic Probation; Failed a clinical rotation; Failed an end -of-rotation exam; Failed to pa ss a COMLEX -USA Qualifying Exam within the required number of attempts; Failed to pa ss an appropriate COMLEX-USA e xamination; or Failed to make acade mic progress, or follow directives set forth, in an assigned remediation plan, any Board preparation programs, or any Modified Course of Study. Upon initial review of a referral of a student to the APPS Committee, the Chair of the APPS Committee has the discretion to determine an intermediary action, such as the student meeting with the appropriate Associate Dean or other designated individual , which may be warranted in an effort to resolve the issue in lieu of an APPS Committee hearing. The Vice Dean for Academic Affairs, or designee, will Chair the APPS Committee. Members of the APPS Committee have the following roles: The appropriate Associate Dean for the academic year involved reports on the academic progress of student(s), as necessary. The Associate Dean may submit a written or oral report documenting assistance the student has received or been offered, including , but not limited to , tutoring or advising. The Course Director, Department Chair, or the student's Faculty Advisor may be invited to an APPS Committee meeting to comment on student performance and related topics, as necessary. The Ex ecutive Director of Student Affairs may report on documentation the Office of Student Affairs has which may be relevant to the student's academic progress. The Registrar is available to discuss the student's academic record , if needed. The APPS Committe e Chair shall identify a secretary to record minutes and to ensure all communications occur in a timely manner. 215 Each student reviewed by the APPS Committee is provided the opportunity to make a maximum of a ten -minute oral presentation (no PowerPoint presentations or handouts except for written reports from a medical provider ) relevant to any issues or considerations the student wishes to make known to the APPS Committee. Members of the APPS Committee may then directly question the student. This is the only portion of the meeting at which the student may be physically present. In lieu of an in- person oral presentation, the student may be allowed to phone or videoconference (e.g., Zoom or WebEx) into the APPS Committee meeting and has the option to submi t a written document, no more than two pages, single -spaced. These options are only available upon approval by the Chair of the APPS Committee, pending a valid reason for not presenting in- person. In certain circumstances, such as a request to reschedule a national licensing exam while completing a mandated Board review program, the student can elect to forego appearing before the APPS Committee. In this case, the student may delegate either the Chair or Vice -Chair of the APPS Committee to present the request on his/her behalf to the APPS Committee. The APPS committee will not accept or consider any additional information from the student, or on behalf of the student, after the student has exited the meeting. All sessions of the APPS Committee are close d to all individuals except those immediately concerned in the case. APPS Committee meetings are not considered legal hearings, therefore neither attorneys nor other representatives (e.g., healthcare providers) are allowed to attend. All persons present at the proceedings shall be bound to disclose no more than the Committee does in its official report on the case. Subject to FERPA, a ll deliberations, minutes, findings, and recommendations of the APPS Committee functions remain confidential except where the student waives confidentiality or the release is required by law. All APPS Committee meeting minutes and evidence are maintained in the Office of the Dean. The APPS Committee Chair will notify the student in writing of the decision of the APPS Committee meeting as soon as practical. Upon receipt of notification, the student must sign and return the Notice of Decision within the timeframe defined in the letter. The student shall have the right to submit a written appeal of the APPS Committee decision to the Dean within five (5) business days of receipt of notification in accordance with Section 6.7.8 of this Bulletin. 216 6.7.2 Student Professionalism and Ethics Standards All CUSOM students are expected to conduct themselves in a professional and ethical manner at all times. Establishing and maintaining the highest concepts of honor and personal integrity during medical school is critical to the training of physicians. It is the responsibility of the student to support the standards of student conduct and it is reasonable to expect this of all students attending CUSOM. All CUSOM students have the rights and obligations of other citizens and measure the urgency of these obligations in the light of responsibilities to colleagues, to their profession, and to the institution. When CUSOM students speak or act as private citizens, they must avoid creating the impression of speaking or acting for their School or the University. As such, they should not identify themselves as CUSOM students when posting comments or material on websites, social media, or other forms of communication without the express permission of the Dean. As citizens engaged in a profession which depends upon freedom for its health and integrity, students have a particular obligation to promote conditions of free inquiry and to further public understanding of academic freedom. Student Statement of Professional Ethics As a CUSOM stude nt, I will... Be guided by a deep c onviction of the w orth and dignity of all human life; Pursue the a dvancem ent of knowl edge and recognize the special responsibilitie s placed u pon m e; Adhere to the policies and procedures of CUSOM in all matters; Seek and communicate truth; Promote scholarly compe tence and integrity; Practice intellectual honesty; Uphold scholarly and ethical st andards; Demonstrate respect for peers, faculty, staff, administration and the community in general; Foster hone st acade mic conduc t and ensure student evaluations reflect the stude nt's true merit; Promote appropriate interaction between students and facul ty, stude nts and administr ation, and students and st aff; Avoid any exploitation, harassment, or discriminatory treatment; Respect and defend the free inqui ry of associates' exchange of ideas and sh ow respect for the opinions of others; and Give due regard to the paramount responsibilities within the institution in determining the amount and character of work done ou tside it. 217 Respect for Patients CUSOM takes the utmost care to ensure patient respect and confidentiality. As osteopathic medical students, students must demonstrate respect for patients through appropriate language and behavior, including that which is non-threatening and non- judgmental. This respect extends to interactions with standardized patients, including simulated patients, during all OSCE, clinical skills, OMM, and simulation experiences/labs. In order to maintain professional relationships with patients and their families, patient privacy and modesty will be respected during history taking, physical ex aminations, and any other contact. It is critical for students to be truthful and not intentionally mislead or give false information. Students should avoid disclosing information to a patient which only the patient's physician should reveal. Students s hould always, or at the request of the patient, consult more experienced members of the medical team regarding patient care. Respect for Faculty, Staff, Colleagues, Hospital Personnel, and Community Students will respect faculty, staff, colleagues, and others, including hospital personnel, guests, and members of the general public. This respect should be demonstrated by punctuality in relationships with patients and peers, prompt execution of reasonable instructions, and deference to those with superior knowledge, experience or capabilities. Students should express views in a calm and respectful manner when in disagreement with another individual, understanding that a mutual agreement will not always be reached. Respect for Self All students should uphold a high level of personal ethics, beliefs, and morals in their daily conduct. Respect for Laws, Policies and Regulations Students must respect and obey the laws, policies, and regulations at all levels of the University and the local community, state and federal government. 6.7.2.1 Chaperon ed Physical E xam Policy Purpose The purpose of this policy is to define the need for, and usage of, chaperones in patient care, simulation, and teaching environments of Campbell University and its affiliated sites. 218 Patient/learner trust cannot be maintained without a basic understanding of the limits and responsibilities of the profess ional's role. The valued human experience of the physician -patient relationship is damaged when there is either confusion regarding professional roles and behavior or clear lack of integrity that allows sexual exploitation and harm. Sexual impropriety ma y comprise behavior, gestures, or expressions that are seductive, sexually suggestive, disrespectful of patient privacy, or sexually demeaning to a patient, that may include, but are not limited to: 1. Neglecting to employ appropriate disrobing or draping pr actices respecting the patient's privacy, or deliberately watching a patient dress or undress ; 2. Subjecting a patient to an intimate examination in the presence of medi cal students or other parties without the p atient's informed consent or in the event such info rmed consent has been withd rawn; 3. Examination or touching of genital muco sal areas without the use of gloves; 4. Inapp ropriate comments about or to the patient, including but not limited to, making s exual comments about a patient's body or unde rclothing, making s exualized or sexually demeaning comments to a patient, criticiz ing the p atient's sexual orientation, or making comments about potential sexual performance during a n examination; 5. Using the physician-patient relationship to solicit a date or romantic relationship; 6. Initiation by the physician of conversation regarding the sexual probl ems, pr eferences, or f antasi es of the physician; 7. Performi ng an intimate examination or consultation without clinical justification; 8. Performi ng an intimate examination or consultat ion without explaining to the pa tient the need for such examination or consultation even when the e xamination or consultation is pertinent to the issue of s exual function or dysfunction; and/or 9. Requesting details of sexual history or sexual likes or dislikes when not clinically indicated for the type of examination or consultation. Policy Medical students at any level of training are held to the same ethical standards as established by the medical profession. 219 Efforts to provide a comfortable and considerate atmosphere for the patient and t he learner are part of respecting patients' dignity. These efforts may include, but are not limited to, providing appropriate gowns, private facilities for undressing, sensitive use of draping, and clearly explaining various components of the physical examination. Having chaperones present during the physical exam can also help prevent misunderstandings between patient and learner or health care provider. CUSOM students and facul ty should: 1. Adhere to a policy that patients are free to request a chaperone during the medi cal encounter and ensure that the policy is clearly communicated to pa tients. 2. Alwa ys honor a patient's request to have a chaperone. 3. Never perform invasive or sensitive exams such as breast, pelvic, rectal, and genitourina ry exams without the p resence of an authori zed chaperone. 4. Have an authori zed memb er of the health care team serve as a chaperone. Physicians should establis h clear expectations that chaperones will uphold profe ssional standards of privacy and confide ntiality. 5. Use a chaperone even when a patient's trusted companion or family memb er is pre sent. 6. Provide oppor tunity for private conversation with the patient without the chaperone present. Physicians should minimize inqui ries or history taki ng of a sensitive n ature during a chaperoned examination. 7. Have chaperones available regardless of the ph ysician's gender. 8. Inform the patient that an appropr iate staff member can act as a chaperone if required and where possible this will be a staff member of the same gender as the patient. 9. Respect that the patient has the right, at all times, to decline a particular p erson a s chaperone. 10. Utilize the learning or simulation environme nt in a mann er consistent with r especting patient pri vacy. 11. Utilize same gender models for sensitive physical exam demonstr ations whe never possible (cardiac exam, sa cral exam, etc...). 12. Perform Osteopathic Manual Manipul ation (OMM) only on subjects or patients who a re adequately clothed to cove r all sensitive a reas. 13. Not p erform O MM as an invasive procedure. 14. Respect the right of a patient participating in an educat ional activity (such as, but not limited to OMM lab, ultrasound lab, clinical skills) to refuse any component of the ph ysical exam. 220 15. Respect the right of a child volunt eer in the OMM or Clinical Skills lab to refuse any component of a physical exam, even if approva l to perform the exam has been given by the parent. Children participating in OMM or Cl inical Skills labs must never be forcefully subjected to any physical exam, even if the exam is not c onside red sensitive in na ture. Family members or friends of the patient should not be expected to undertake any formal chaperone role. There is a risk of inadvertent breaches of confidentiality and embarrassment if friends or relatives are chaperones, and they are best avoided unless there is no alternative than postponing an immediately necessary physical examination. There is also the possibility of collusion betwee n the patient and friend/relative/caregiver to conspire where any complaint of abuse is made. Medical students must not conduct any intimate examination unsupervised even if the patient provides permission for them to proceed with the examination without a chaperone. Medical students cannot act as a chaperone to their clinical partner (another medical student) or another health care provider for intimate examinations. It is important that students seek verbal consent from patients for any form of examination. For intimate examinations, informed consent is particularly important. Intimate examinations include the following: vaginal e xamination; rectal e xamination; external genitalia examination; breast examination; and any other examination that might embarrass patients throug h the removal of clothes, particularly those examinations that might expose external genitalia or breasts. Procedur e Communicate the chaperone protocol to patients by prominent notice through conversation with the patient. Honor all requests for a chaperone. Utilize private facilities for undressing, incorporate sensitive use of draping, and provide clear explanations on the various components of the physical examination to be performed. o The nature of the proced ure/examination should be explain ed o The purpose of the procedure/examination should be clearly stated, (e.g. \"it is t o help me learn how to...\") 221 o There should be an explanation, where relevant, of what will happen to the information collected (e.g., \"I will record my finding s in the medi cal notes... \") o The patient's understanding , and acceptance , of the procedure/ examination should be assessed and documented Utilize chaperones on a consistent ba sis, particularly for intimate examinations and those that may be constr ued as such regardless of physician or learner's gender. When a chaperone is present, keep patient inqui ries of a sensitive nature to a minimum. Provide a separate oppor tunity for a private conve rsation be tween the patient and the physician, in order to protect the patient's p ersonal health info rmation (PHI). Provide an authori zed health pro fessional to s erve as the chaperone whe never possibl e. During a rectal/vaginal examination, sur gical gloves mu st be worn. Glov es act as a barrier and thus h elp to maintain the clinical natu re of the exam. Throughout the examination the healthcare professional must remain alert to verbal and non- verbal indications of dis tress from the p atient. A ny request for the examination to be discontinue d should be respected and doc ument ed in t he patient's records. Any discussion during the examination should be kept relevant avoidi ng any unnecessa ry personal comments regardless of whether a chaperone is pr esent. A person who is feeling embarrassed or vulne rable is more likely to m isinterpret a comment. Document in t he patient not e or c hart the presence of a chaperone with a ny intimate examination or those that ma y be constr ued as such. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) offers the following additional guidance on the use of chaperones for children and adoles cents: In the medic al office setting, the physical examination of an infant, toddl er, or child should always be performed in the presence of a parent or guardian. If a parent or guardian is unavailable or the parent's presence will interfere with the p hysical examination, such as in a possible case of abuse or pa rental ment al health issues, a chaperone shou ld be present during the p hysical examination. Cons equences of Non-compliance Items of potential non -compliance are of serious concern and will require confirmation via investigation of any allegation. Due to the sensitive nature of the grievance, CUSOM will require that all real and 222 standardized patient interactions involving the accused be immediately suspended at the time of the grievance, pending the investigation conclusion. As outlined in this Academic Bulletin, the AP PS Committee is responsible for the review of situations where students are involved in academic misconduct, or unprofessional conduct. The CUSOM Honor Code will guide this review. Outcomes of an APPS Committee intervention may include, but are not limited to, any of the following levels of discipline: Disciplinary Probation; Suspension; Withdrawal; Dismissal from the program w ithou t the option to return; or Revocation of De gree Violations of patient rights are serious matte rs and may result in crimin al charges. FERPA privacy laws do not prot ect v iolations of a crimin al natu re. Conclusions regarding fitness to practice and treatment if appropriate. According to the recommendations made by the Federation of State Medical Boards, Campbell University supports the loss of enrollment into the school, as well as revocation of degree upon confirmed misconduct. 6.7.3 Honor Code The Campbell University Jerry M. Wallace School of Osteopathic Medicine Honor Code of Conduct (CUSOM Honor Code) embodies a spirit of mutual trust, intellectual honesty, and professionalism between the School and the student body, and it is the highest expression of the values shared by the CUSOM and Campbell University communities. The CUSOM Honor Code is based on the fundamental belie f that every student is worthy of trust and it is maintained to protect the right to participate in an academic environment free from injustice caused by dishonesty. Further, CUSOM students are expected to conduct themselves in a professional and ethical manner befitting the honorable profession they are entering. Students have an obligation to maintain the highest standards of honesty and integrity. It is not possible to enumerate all examples of expected academic and professional behavior, nor is it possible to enumerate all behaviors considered inappropriate, unprofessional, unethical, or not in keeping with the standards of a CUSOM student. The following serves only as a guideline to students. 223 In general, the founding principles of the CUSOM Honor Code are the established rules and regulations of the CUSOM community. The CUSOM community includes CUSOM, affiliated hospitals, and any institution where CUSOM students pursue activities for academic credit. Violation of these rules and regulations may constitute a violation of the CUSOM Honor Code. In addition, specific examples of behavior which may constitute a violation of the CUSOM Honor Code include, but are not limited to, the following: Cheating: Providing , acquiring or receiving any unauthori zed assistance or unfair advantage on any form of academic work, or attempt thereof. Sharing inf ormation f rom testing/exams is also conside red a form of cheating. Plagiarism: Copying the language, structure, ideas, algorithms, or comput er code of another and representing it as one's own work on any form of academic work or attempt thereof. Falsification: Fabrication of in formation on a ny form of academic work or attempt the reof; including, but not limited to, the f ollowin g: o Clinical requirements; o Externships and clinical rotations ; o Assignments such a s: ob taining patient hi stories, performi ng physical exams, orde ring or int erpreting laboratory tests, documenting a nd submi tting rotation records, etc...; o CUSOM lab, skills workshop, small group session, and clinical rotation attendance reports ; or o Clinical preceptor or other faculty evaluation or grading forms . Disruptive Behavior : Any inapp ropriate etiquette or inappr opriate disturbance either solely or repeated often enough oft en enough to establis h a disrespectful trend. Inappropri ate disturbances include but are not l imited to t he following: o Arriving late for class, lab, or clinical rotations; o Disrupting class with cellular phone s; o Disrupting class with c omput ers or c omput er games; o Disrupting class with loud talking or other activities which create a distraction; o Leaving trash in classrooms or academic areas, including student small g roup stu dy room s; o Bringing food into unauthori zed areas or hosting food functions without pe rmissio n; o Posting una pprove d materials pprove d mat erials in inappr opriate areas; or o Parking in inappropriate or reserved spa ces. Unacceptable use of technolog y: Any violation of the acceptable use guidelines as publ ished by the CU SOM IT department or as noted in the Campbell University Technology Usage Policy: https://www.campbell.edu/information -technology - services/acceptable- use-policy/ 224 In addition, unaccept able uses of technolog y include, but are not limited to, the following: o Using compute rs for pur poses which are conside red unprofessional or i mmoral ; o Accessi ng pornographic material at any time while on any campus of the CUSOM community or using any equipm ent of the CUSOM community to acc ess such m aterial; o Distributing, posting, or uploading materials to students or any other third party not authorized to receive them or to those outside CUSOM is an Honor Code violation. Lecture materials, includi ng PowerPoint presentations, and videos contain confide ntial and proprietary info rmation and material protected by intellectual p roperty laws. Students do not ha ve permission to sha re them.; or o Any device capable of capturing still or video images or audio recordings, including cell phones, are not permitted in any laboratory (anatomy, clinical skills, OMM, Simulation), or in any clinical setting, including and not limited to OSCE, standardized patients, clinical rotations, and the student health clinic. Unprofessional or unethical behavior : Behavior on or off the CUSOM campus that would or could cause a loss of respect or confidence in the offending student or in the CUSOM community by the public, faculty, staff, colleagues, or the-communi ty-at-large. Unprofessional or unethical behavior may include, but is not limited to , the following: Entering or using the facilities of the CUS OM community without appropri ate authori zation or during inappropri ate times; Knowingly and purpos ely disrupt ing teaching, research, administrative, or student func tions of the CUSOM community; Abusive or disrespectful conduc t toward members of the faculty, administrative or pro fessional staff, employees, students, patients, or visitors of the CUSOM communi ty. Medical simulators should be treated with the same level of respect and professionalism as standardized or actual patients ; Disclosure of privil eged information from campus activities or patient care; Taking pictures or recording video in the anatomy lab, clinical lab, OSCE rooms, or in any rooms housing clinical simulators; Impro per relationships or activities invol ving persons entrusted to a student as part of educational requirements, which extend beyond those educational requirements. Entrusted persons may inclu de, but are not limited to, patients or othe r stud ents unde r supervisio n; Controlled substance screening tests which show abnormalities including, but not limited, to excessively dilute urine, or screening tests 225 which are positive (i.e., evidence of the substance or showing presence) for alcohol, prescription medications without a valid prescription, or substances which are illegal in the state of North Carolina. Controlled substance screening results are viewed in light of North Carolina and federal laws governing illegal substances. For example, although the use of marijuana is legal in some states, the US Federal Drug Enforcement Agency lists it as an illegal drug. Its use or abuse impairs the ability of a healthcare professional to provide optimal care to patients ; o As such, the use of marijuana in any form is a violation of University policy. Anothe r example is a breathalyzer result or a blood a lcohol concentr ation sample identi fying lev els of alcohol above the legal limit in violation of law, such as in a Driving Und er the Influence (DUI), Driving While Intoxicated (DWI), or a similar charge. The presence of these subs tances, regardless of any legal consid erations or adjudi the courts, unp rofessional or unethical b ehavior b y CUSOM. Breach of Integrity: Any behavior at any time that is conside red a severe lapse in judgment and has the potential to damage the professional, ethical or moral integrity of the CUSOM community; or A violation of any policy of the Univ ersity or CUSOM, including but not limited to the A merican Osteopathic Asso ciation Code of E thics. Section 6.7.5 of this Bulletin, \" Procedures for Calling and Conducting an APPS Committee Meeting Regarding Non- Academic Matters\", describes the process for addressing cases related to allegations of misconduct or professionalism and/or Honor Code violations. In such cases, the Executive Director of Student Affairs or respective Associate Dean, notifi es the Associate Dean for Clinical Integration of the suspected violation and provides him/her with a detailed summary of the reason for referral along with all supporting documentation. The Associate Dean for Clinical Integration then, (i) constitutes an ad hoc committee to investigate the suspected misconduct, who reports their findings in writing to the Vice Dean for Academic Affairs, or (ii) depending upon the severity of the allegations, refers the matter directly to the APPS Committee. 6.7.4 Code of Miscon duct Violations may include , but are not limited to: Harassment (other than a violation of the Title IX Policy), harm, a buse, or damage to any person or prope rty in the CUSOM community. This include s know ingly or purp osely ng proper ty; Arrest for a crimin al offense othe r than a minor traffic offense; Participating in academic or clinical endeav ors in the CUSOM community while unde r the influ ence of alcohol, or c ontroll ed substances; 226 Use, possession, or distribution of alcohol, illicit subst ances, prescription me dications without a valid prescription, or substances which are illegal in the state of North Carolina may result in disciplinary action up to and including dismiss al. Controll ed substances will be viewed in light of North Carolina and federal laws governing illegal substances. Please note this include s substances which are illegal in the state of N orth Ca rolina, but which m ay be legal in other states; or Com municating or posting of information or images in a public arena, including w ritten or electroni c/Internet communications, which could result in a loss of re spect by patients or other memb ers of the public toward the offending student or tow ard CUSO M. 6.7.5 Procedures for Calling and Conducting an APPS Committee Meeting Regarding Non -Academic Matters Reasons for an APPS/ ad hoc Committee hearing/meeting for non -academic matters include, but are not limited to, allegations that the student has : Violated the CUSOM Honor Code or Code of Misconduct ; Violate d any CUSOM or Campbell Unive rsity policy/procedure or provision of this Bulletin; Failed a c ontrolled substance screening test; Failed to maintain required vaccinations as scheduled; Received f indings on a criminal backg round check that would affect the student's matriculation or a clinical rotation; Failed to adhere to set timelines/due dates; Failed to update contact information; or Failed to respond in timely manner to email and other forms of communication from CUSOM. Allegations of misconduct may arise from an individual student, group of students, faculty member, clinical preceptor, staff member, or member of the community. For issues arising from Honor Code, Code of Misconduct, or professionalis m or ethics violations, the person(s) identifying the issue(s) should report the issue(s) to the Executive Director of Student Affairs or the respective Associate Dean (Biomedical or Clinical) within five (5) business days of the incident. The Executive Director of S tudent Affairs or respective Associate Dean will collect documentation which may be relevant to the alleged violation. This may include, but is not limited to, a written report from the student(s), faculty , or staff involved with the incident(s). In the case where students are reporting the suspected violation, unless required at a hearing, waived by the subject(s) of the alleged violation, or required by law, confidentiality of the reporting student is maintained, and the Executive Director of Student Af fairs or respective Associate Dean will present the reporting student(s)'s testimony. Dated notes are taken to describe the discussion. 227 The Executive Director of Student Affairs or respective Associate Dean notifies the Associate Dean for Clinical Integra tion of the suspected misconduct or violation and provides him/her with a detailed summary of the reason for referral along with all supporting documentation. The Associate Dean for Clinical Integration then, (i) constitutes an ad hoc committee to investigate the suspected misconduct, who reports their findings in writing to the Vice Dean for Academic Affairs, or (ii) depending upon the severity of the allegations, refers the matter directly to the APPS Committee. If forwarded to the APPS Committee pursuant to Section 6.7.6, the recommendations of the ad hoc committee or the decision of the Vice Dean for Academic Affairs are presented to the APPS Committee at the hearing. The student( s) shall meet with the APPS Committee and be informed of the alleg ations and afforded an opportunity to explain him/herself and offer any mitigating factors. All sessions of the Committee are closed to all individuals except those immediately concerned in the case. APPS Committee meetings are no t considered legal heari ngs, therefore neither attorneys nor other representatives (e.g., healthcare providers) are allowed to attend. All persons present at the proceedings shall be bound to disclose no more than the Committee does in its official report on the case. The testi mony of each witness is provided while the other witnesses in the case are out of the room. The Committee may allow introduction of evidence other than testimony of witnesses (for example, documentary evidence) provided the evidence is relevant to the que stion before the Committee on any matter. The Committee shall set rules for the conduct of all cases and all arrangements connected with collecting evidence. Timeframes for investigation of hearings and proceedings may be altered if circumstances warrant . Deliberation of either the ad hoc Committee or the full APPS Committee shall take place in private and remain confidential, and the standard for a decision in a hearing involving misconduct or honor code violations shall be based on a preponderance of t he evidence (whether a violation is more likely than not to have occurred). All APPS Committee meeting minutes and evidence are maintained in the Office of the Dean. The APPS Committee Chair will notify the student in writing of the decision of the APPS Committee meeting as soon as practical. Upon receipt of notification, the student must sign and return the Notice of Decision within the timeframe defined in the letter. 228 The student shall have the right to submit a written appeal of the APPS Committee decision to the Dean within five (5) business days of receipt of notification in accordance with Section 6.7.8 of this Bulletin. 6.7.5.1 Rights of the Student With respect to a hearing regarding non -academic matters , the Student(s) is guaranteed the right to: a timely hearing, if requested ; receive notice of the allegation(s) at least three (3) days prior to the hearing ; a presumption of innocence until proven guilty ; solicit advice ; expect the case to be adjudicated in a confidential manner ; and appeal the decision to the Dean in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.7.8 of this Bulletin . 6.7.6 Ad hoc Comm ittee Proced ures If referred to an ad hoc Committee, the Chair of the ad hoc Committee will schedule a hearing with the ad hoc Committee and notify the accused student(s) (the \"Respondent\") at least three (3) business days prior to the hearing. This hearing typically is held as soon as practical following the referral of the case to the ad hoc Committee. The Respondent(s) shall meet with the ad hoc Committee and be informed of the allegations and afforded an opportuni ty to explain him/herself and offer any mitigating factors. Although the hearing's purpose is fact -finding, the Respondent(s) shall have the right to offer witnesses to support his/her position. The ad hoc committee will not accept or consider any additional information from the student, or on behalf of the student, after the student has exited the ad hoc committee meeting. All sessions of the ad hoc Committee are closed to all individuals except those immediately concerned in the case. No legal counsel shall be present, as this is not a legal proceeding. All persons present at the proceedings shall be bound to disclose no more than the Committee does in its official report on the case. The testimony of each witness is conducted in private while the other witnesses in the case are out of the room. 229 After the ad hoc committee concludes its investigation, they shall provide a written report to the Vice Dean for Academic Affairs in a timely manner, which shall include a recommended finding of facts, and if the finding of facts is that a violation occurred, a recommended sanction. If the recommendation is that: 1. No violation occurred, the Vice Dean for Academic Affairs may accept the finding, and so notify the Respondents(s); 2. No violation occurred, and the Vice Dean for Academic Affairs disagrees, he/she may decide: a) Upon an appropriate sanction as set forth below and so notify the Respondents(s); or b) To forward the matter to the APPS Committee for further consideration; 3. A violation occurred, and the V ice Dean for Academic Affairs may accept the finding and the sanction proposed by the ad hoc committee, and so notify the Respondents(s); 4. A violation occurred, and the Vice Dean for Academic Affairs disagrees with the sanction proposed by the ad hoc committee, he/she may decide: a) Upon an appropriate sanction as set forth below, and so notify the Respondents(s); or b) To forward the matter to the APPS Committee for further consideration on the sanction only. The Vice Dean for Academic Affairs notifies the student in writing of his/her decision and if the decision of the Vice Dean for Academic Affairs is: 1. No. 2a, 3, or 4a above and the Respondents(s) accepts the decision, the decision of the Vice Dean for Academic Affairs shall be final; or 2. No. 2a, 3, or 4a above, and Respondent(s) do not accept the decision of the Vice Dean for Academic Affairs, the Respon dent(s) has/have the right to appeal the decision to the APPS Committee; or 3. No. 2b, or 4b above, the matter will be forwarded to the APPS Committee for further consideration. An appeal of the Vice Dean for Academic Affairs' decision to the APPS Committee by the student must be made in writing to the Vice Dean for Academic Affairs within five (5) business days of receipt of notification and be based only upon new and relevant information not available to the student at the time of the hearing. If the student does not appeal within five (5) business days of receipt of notification, the Vice Dean's decision is final. 6.7.7 APPS Committee Sanctions Penalties or sanctions for violation of institutional policies or rules and regulations may be administered regardless of whether the actions of the student are also civil or criminal violations. Whenever disciplinary actions lead to the student leaving CUSOM, grades are assigned in accordance with the CUSOM grading policy. 230 All APPS Committee meeting minutes and evidence are maintained in the Office of the Dean. Depending on the nature of the hearing, the following is a non- exclusive list of sanctions t he APPS Committee may recommend to the Dean or require to be imposed: 6.7.7.1.

Non-appealable Dean -assigned Sanctions In addition to the above sanctions, the Dean has the authority to apply additional academic and professional sanctions, which may not be appealed, and include, but are not limited to : Withholdi ng official transcripts; Barring re-admission to CUSOM , if dismis sed; Prohibiting a student from enrolling for a specified period of time; Assessing monetary or specific duties restitution, or reimbursement for damages to or misappropriation of CUSOM, student, staff, or faculty property ; Dismissal: Dismissal from CUSOM is based upon recommendations made by the APPS Committee, with final approval for dismissal by the Dean; or Revocation of a Degree : The revocation of the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine degree following graduation may occur for discovered misconduct of the student(s) during his/her enrollment which would be grounds for dismissal at the time of the misconduct. In the event of the discovery of such misconduct, the former student will be given notice of a hearing before the APPS Committee in accordance with the procedures set forth herein for a violation of the Code of Misconduct, provided the former student may be entitled to legal representation at the hearing or any appeal. 6.7.8 Appeal of an APPS Committee Decision The APPS Committee Chair will notify the student in writing of the decision of the APPS Committee meeting as soon as practical. Upon receipt of notification, the student must sign and return the Notice of Decision within the timeframe defined in the letter. An appeal of an APPS Commi ttee decision by the student must be based only upon new and relevant information not available to the student at the time of the hearing with the APPS Committee and be made in writing to the Dean within five (5) business days of receipt of notification. Any documentary evidence relating to information available at the time of the hearing, but dated after the hearing, shall not be deemed new evidence. Any medical, psychological, or personal information, known to the student at the time of the APPS Committee meeting must be divulged at the time of the APPS meeting in order to be considered and, if not divulged at that time, cannot be used by the student later as the basis of any appeal. Only information which becomes known to the student after the APPS Com mittee meeting and is relevant to the situation will be deemed new and can serve as the basis for an appeal to the Dean. 235 The Dean will reply within ten (10) business days of receiving the written appeal. An appeal not received in the Office of the Dean by 5:00pm Eastern five (5) business days after receipt of notification will not be considered, and the decision rendered by the APPS Committee is final. The Dean does not meet with the student prior to receiving the required written appeal material, and the student must make no attempt to meet with the Dean from the date of the written appeal and the date of any potential appeal hearing. No legal counsel shall be present at an appeal meeting with the Dean as these meetings are not legal proceedings. In addition to the sanctions described above, the following actions may also be taken by the Dean in an appeal: Withdrawal is the administrative removal of a student from a class or from CUSOM and may be imposed in instances of unmet financial obligations to CUSOM. The withdrawn student may also be barred from re -enrollment until specific conditions have been met. Dismissal from the program without the option to return. The Dean's decision is final. 6.7.9 Release of Information All documents and other information concerning student discipline, inclu ding written reprim ands, are securely maintain ed in a confide ntial file. Such actions become a part of the student 's permanent educat ion record but are only released at the written disc retion of the D ean. Ho wever, all disciplinary actions, with the exception of Admonitions, Academic and Conduct Warnings, are required to be reported o n the M edical Student Performance Evaluation (M SPE). 6.8 Separation from the Program 6.8.1 Separation from CUSOM There are four (4) categories of separation from CUSOM: Leave of Absence Withdrawal Suspension Dismissal The Dean makes all final decisions regarding any separation from CUSOM. All current or former students returning from an a pproved period away from CUSOM ( such as, but not limited to, a Leave of Absence or an offer to repeat an academic year ), minimally must submit a completed Secondary Application, Background Check, and Controlled Substance Screen within a timeframe designated by CUSOM . The Background Check and Controlled Substance 236 Screen must be completed, and the results provided to CUSOM, no earlier than sixty (60) calendar days prior to the anticipated return date . For example, a student returning from a Medical Withdrawal on August 1, the Background Check and Controlled Substance Screen must be completed and results provided to CUSOM between June 2 and July 31. Additional requirements, such as a medical or psychiatric evaluation, may be placed on returning students as deemed appropriate. The Executive Committee of the Admissions Committee, consisting of the Chair, two Vice -Chairs and at least two other members , will determine whether or not the student is offered acceptance. In cases in which there is a potential conflict of interest or two of the above members are not available, the Dean may designate another member of the full A dmissions C ommittee to participate. Students who do not return on the approved date, or otherwise do not fulfill all of the requirements for return, will need to re -apply through AACOMAS and will not be guaranteed re -admission. In order to return from any approved separation, the student must provide the Dean with documentation verifying completion of the terms of the approved separation. Once approved for return, t he Executive Committee of the APPS Committee consisting of the Chair, two Vice -Chairs and at least two other members, will determine placement of a student who has taken an approved separation to determine where the student will resume the curriculum and if any additional action or supplementary educational curriculum is required. In cases in which there is a potential conflict of interest or two of the above members are not available, the Dean may designate another member of the full APPS Committee to par ticipate. Recommendations will be based on the requisite knowledge skills and abilities required to resume at a specific point in the curriculum coupled with a focus on ensuring the appropriate continuum of the medical education curriculum and training re quired to be successful, perform well on licensing exams, and provide competent and compassionate patient care. 6.8.2 Leave of Absence A Leave of Absence is granted by the Dean. A leave of absence is a temporary separation from CUSOM which may not last longer than 180 calendar days. Reasons for a leave include, but are not limited to, academic, personal, medical, and maternity. If a leave exceeds 180 calendar days, it will become a Withdrawal. A Leave of Absence is requested in writing, addressed to t he Dean and delivered to the Executive Director of Student Affairs , who then provides it to the Dean. A Leave of Absence request must also include an anticipated date of return. The Dean in turn makes the final determination on the Leave of Absence reque st. 237 A Leave of Absence request requires completion of a Leave of Absence form and may or may not require the return of CUSOM issued items depending upon the specific circumstances of the Leave of Absence. The date for a Leave of Absence is the date of the Dean's approval of the Leave of Absence request. Where the absence is an Academic Leave of Absence, a Personal Leave of Absence, a Medical Leave of Absence of less than 180 days, or a Withdrawal, and the student reapplies for admission: 1. The Executive Committee of the Admissions Committee consisting of the Chair, two Vice -Chairs and at least two other members, will determine whether or not the student is offered acceptance. In cases in which there is a potential conflict of interest or two of the above members are not available, the Dean may designate another member of the full Admissions Committee to participate. Once approved for return, the Executive Committee of the APPS Committee consisting of the Chair, two Vice -Chairs and at least two other memb ers will determine placement of a student who has taken an approved Academic Leave of Absence to determine where the student will resume the curriculum and if any additional action or supplementary educational curriculum is required. In cases in which the re is a potential conflict of interest or two of the above members are not available, the Dean may designate another member of the full APPS Committee to participate. Recommendations will be based on the requisite knowledge skills and abilities required t o resume a specific point in the curriculum coupled with a focus on ensuring the appropriate continuum of the medical education curriculum and training required to be successful, perform well on licensing exams, and provide competent and compassionate pati ent care. 2. Except for a Personal Withdrawal, S tudents who do no t return on the approved date, or otherwise do not fulfill all the r equirements for return, will need to re-apply throug h AACOMAS and will not be guaranteed re-admission. 6.8.2.1 Academic Leave of Absence An Academic Leave of Absence is a unique situation, usually of a one-year duration, which allows students to pursue a research opportunity or complete a one -year post -secondary degree. Upon completion of this additional educational, experiential activity or scholarly pursuit, the student m inimally must submit a compl eted Seconda ry Appli cation, Background Check, and Controll ed Substance Screen within a timeframe designated by CUSOM, as described in Section 6.8.1. 238 In order to return from any approved Academic Leave of Absence, the stude nt must provide doc umen tation verifying completion of the terms of the approved Academic Leave of Absence and an anticipated date of return as described in Section 6.8.1. The letter from the Dean approving an Academic Leave of Absence will delineate any specific outcomes required upon return from the leave, such as a list of abstracts, publications, grants submitted, or other tangible evidence of productivity resulting from the leave. 6.8.2.2 Personal L eave of Absence A Personal Leave of Absence is granted by the Dean and may not last longer than 180 calendar days. A Personal Leave of Absence is available to address situations such as a death of a spouse, child, or such other circumstance that would interrupt a student's education. In order to return from any approved Personal Leave of Absence, the student must provide the Dean with documentation verifying completion of the terms of the approved Personal Leave of Absence , including an anticipated date of return as described in Section 6.8.1. 6.8.2.3 Med ical Leave of Absence (Absence Less than 180 Calendar Days) A Medical Leave of Absence may be granted to students who are in good academic standing, who provide acceptable supporting documentation indicating a valid medical reason requiring a leave of less than 180 calendar days and an anticipated date of return . Decisions regarding the granting of a medical leave are determined by the Dean. A Medical Leave of Absence may last no longer than 180 calendar days, if the leave extends beyond 180 calendar days it will automatically become a Medical Withdrawal as described below . In order to return from an approved medical leave, the student must provide the Dean with documentat ion from a physician approving/releasing the student to return as a full -time student in the curriculum as described in Section 6.8.1. 6.8.2.4 Student Maternity Leave of Absence A Student Maternity Leave of Absence may be granted to students who provide acceptable supporting documentation indicating a need to take a leave of absence because of their pregnancy. The required period of leave may include time before the delivery, after deliver y, or both. This documentation must include an estimated date of delivery or, if a leave must be continue beyond delivery, the date delivery occurred. A student returning from a Student Maternity 239 Leave of Absence must provide a letter from their treating physician clearing them to return to CUSOM on a full -time unrestricted b asis. Decisions regarding the granting of a maternity leave are determined by the Dean. A Student Maternity Leave of Absence extending more than 180 calendar days will require the s tudent to file for request a Medical Withdrawal. The student will meet with either the Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs (MS -1 and MS-2), or Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs (MS - 3 and MS-4), and the Executive Director of Student Affairs at the earliest available time to discuss the anticipated maternity leave. The student will provide the Executive Director of Student Affairs a proposed timeline of requested leave. The student must schedule meetings and acquire signatures from the Offi ce of Financial Aid and the Bursar's Office a s part of their leave process to avoid any ambiguity with the effect the leave may have on a student's financial aid. The student will provide a medical note from her medical provider with an anticipated return -to-school date. This date should be the date when the student is medically cleared to resume all activities of the curriculum as a full -time student, with no restrictions. If the treating medical provider places an activity or time restriction on the student, the nature of the restriction(s) and the time frame for these restrictions must be well defined. Based on the date of return to full -time status, either the Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs ( MS-1 and MS-2 students ), or the Associat e for Clinical Affairs ( MS-3 and MS-4 students ) will develop a proposed Modified Schedule. The student will meet with either the Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs (MS -1 and MS-2), or Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs (MS - 3 and MS-4) and the Executive Dir ector of Student Affairs to review and discuss the proposed Modified Schedule. The student will sign the Attestation section after any additional changes are made and agreed upon by all parties. The student will provide medical documentation to the Execu tive Director of Student Affairs from her medical provider documenting full medical clearance for return, including a definitive date of return. The Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs (MS -1 and MS-2), will contact and inform the Assistant Director of M edical Education , the Registrar , and the Course Directors for the affected courses , of the 240 Modified Schedule, and the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs (MS - 3 and MS-4) will contact and inform the appropriate Regional Dean/ DSME , clinical campus Student Medical Education Coordinator and Registrar of the Modified Schedule. The Executive Director of Student Affairs will notify the Chief of Operations of the Modified Schedule. 6.8.2.5 Parental Leave of Absence CUSOM may grant leave for students whose significant other gives birth or adopts a child while enrolled in the curriculum. A Parental Leave of Absence may be granted on a case -by-case basis. Students requesting a parental leave of absence must be in good academic stand ing and provide appropriate documentation. A Parental Leave of Absence may be up to four (4) weeks for non- birth parents following the birth, or adoption, of a child. The student will meet with either the Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs (MS -1 and MS-2) or Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs (MS - 3 and MS-4), and the Executive Director of Student Affairs at the earliest available time to discuss the anticipated Parental Leave. The student provides the Executive Director of Student Affairs a proposed timeline of the requested leave. The student must schedule meetings and acquire signatures from the Office of Financial Aid and the Bursar's Office as part of their leave process to avoid any ambiguity with the effect the leave may have on a student's fi nancial aid. Following the birth or adoption, the non- birth parent will provide the Office of Student Affairs with an anticipated return -to-school date. Once an anticipated return date is identified, either the Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs ( MS-1 and MS-2) or the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs ( MS-3 and MS-4) will develop a proposed Modified Schedule. The Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs will work with the Course Directors, Medical Education, and Student Affairs to develop the Modified Schedule. The Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs will work with the student's Regional Dean/DSME , clinical campus Student Medical Education Coordinator , Registrar, and Student Affairs to develop the Modified Schedule. The student will meet with either the Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs (MS -1 and MS-2) or Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs (MS - 3 and MS-4) and the Executive Director of Student Affairs to review and discuss the proposed Modified Schedule. 241 The Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs (MS -1 and MS-2) will contact and inform the Director of Medical Education and Accreditation , the Registrar, and the Course Directors for the affected courses of the Modified Schedule and the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs (MS -3 and MS-4) will contact and inform the appropriate Regional Dean/ DSME , clinical campus Student Medical Education Coordinator, and Registrar of the Modified Clinical Rotations Schedule. 6.8.3 Withdrawal Withdrawal from CUSOM is granted by the Dean. A Withdrawal may be a temporary separation from CUSOM , which may last longer than 180 calendar days or permanent separation from CUSOM. Reasons for a withdrawal include, but are not limited to, personal and medical. Any request for Withdraw al must be completed prior to beginning the first final course assessment (e.g., exam) of a Block or clinical rotation (e.g., end -of- rotation exam). This would include courses ending earlier than other courses in a Block (e.g., a student would need to wit hdraw before completing the Foundations in Medical Practice course, which typically ends prior to finals week). Failure to withdraw by this date may result in issuance of a grade of F for all courses in that Block, or for that rotation, which will be reco rded on the student's transcript and adversely affect the student's GPA. A student may not withdraw if a grade has been assigned or if a final examination or assessment event has been started. Withdrawal from a course or clinical rotation after an examination has been administered and/or a clinical rotation completed, will result in the final grade being the grade of record. As such, a Withdrawal cannot remove a grade of F. A Withdrawal is requested in writing, addressed to the Dean and delivered to the Executive Director of Student Affairs , who then provides it to the Dean. The student must schedule meetings and acquire signatures from the Office of Financial Aid and the Bursar's Office as part of their leave process to avoid any ambiguity with the effect the leave may have on a student's financial aid. The Dean in turn makes the final determination on the Withdrawal request. The student must complete and return a Withdrawal Form and any designated CUSOM issued item s to the Office of Student Affairs before the student will be considered Withdrawn in Good Standing. The date for a Withdrawal is the date of the Dean's approval of the W ithdrawal request. The Dean makes the final decision regarding Withdrawals. Students who discontinue their education at CUSOM, for any reason, are required to complete a Withdrawal Form. 242 Upon receipt of the completed Withdrawal Form and CUSOM issued items, the student is Withdrawn in Good Standing from CUSOM and entitled to certain benefits (i.e., application for readmission or issuance of an official transcript if requested ). Students on Suspension may not withdraw. Students eligible to return from a Withdrawal from CUSOM, minimally must submit a comple ted Secondar y Appli cation, Backg round Check, and Controll ed Substance Screen within a timeframe designated by CUSOM, as described in Section 6.8.1. Additional requiremen ts, such as a medical or p sychiatric evaluation, ma y be placed on r eturning students as deem ed appropriate. Students eligible to return from a Withdrawal may be required to provide the Dean with doc umen tation verifying completion of the terms of the approved Withdrawal as described in Section 6.8.1. NOTE: Althoug h dif ferent ca tegories of W ithdraw al are identified, the student transcript will r eflect a \"W\" for any approved Withdrawal. 6.8.3.1 Personal Wit hdrawal A Personal Withdrawal may be granted to students who wish to voluntarily leave CUSOM for personal reasons. Students withdrawing from CUSOM for personal reasons are not guaranteed re-admission. To be deemed Withdrawn in Good Standing, the student must have passed all classes and be in good academic standing, complete all required paperwork and follow all CUSOM procedures during the withdrawal process. Students eligible to return f rom a Personal Withdrawal may be required to provide the Dean with documentation verifying completion of the terms of the approved withdrawal as described in Section 6.8.1. 6.8.3.2 Med ical Withdrawal (Absence Greater than 180 Calendar Days) A Medical Withdrawal may be granted to students who are in good academic standing and who have an approved medical reason for a medical leave of absence that exceeds 180 calendar days. A student returning from an approved Medical Withdrawal minimally must submit a completed Secondary Application, Background Check, and Controlled Substance Screen within a timeframe designated by CUSOM . The Background Check and Controlled Substance Screen must be completed, and the results provided to CUSOM, no earlier than sixty (60) calendar days prior to the anticipated return date . 243 For example, a student returning from a Medical Withdrawal on August 1, the Background Check and Controlled Substance Screen must be completed and results provided to CUSOM between June 2 and July 31. Additional requirements, such as a medical or psychiatric evaluation, may be placed on returning students as deemed appropriate. In order to return from an approved Medical Withdrawal, the student must also provide the Dean with documentation fr om a physician approving/releasing the student to return as a full -time student in the curriculum as described in Section 6.8.1. 6.8.4 Special Meet ings of the APPS Committee The Dean may call a meeting of the APPS Committee to determine placement of a student who is returning from an approved Leave of Absence, Withdrawal, or Suspension to determine where the student will resume the program and to determine if any additional action or supplementary educational curriculum is required. 6.8.5 Suspension Suspension is defined as a temporary separation from the institution and during this period students are enrolled, not registered and are not eligible for financial aid . The duration of the Suspension will be determined by the Dean and may include recomme ndations from the APPS Committee. While on Suspension, students must not represent themselves as CUSOM students. In addition, they may not be on the University campus or affiliated clinical campuses, participate in any clinical activities or wear their C USOM white coat. Students on Suspension are not eligible to Withdraw. If the terms set out under the Suspension are not fulfilled, or the period of Suspension is greater than 180 calendar days, the student will be dismissed from CUSOM. 6.8.6 Dismissal Dismissal from CUSOM is based upon recommendations made by the APPS Committee, with final approval for dismissal by the De an. 244 6.9 Graduation 6.9.1 Graduation Requirements The degree of Do ctor of Osteopathic Medicine is granted to, and conferred upon, candidates who have : Satisfied all academic requirements, and completed the total number of credits required for their class as calculated at the time of graduation; Passed COMLEX -USA Level 1, COMLEX and COMLEX -USA Level 2 -PE; o As of the d ate of this Bulletin, the NBOME and the COCA have temporarily waived the passing of COMLEX -USA Level 2 -PE as a graduation requirement for the Class of 2022. As such, to be eligible to graduate, each student must pass a summative Objective Structured Clini cal Examination ( OSCE ) administered by CUSOM. Demonstrated good moral, professional, and ethical character; and Completed all required exit paperwork and settled all financial obligations with CUSOM, Campbell University and affiliate and collaborative part ners incurred during the academic program. In accordance with COCA standards, single degree DO students must complete their education within six (6) years following matriculation. T o become eligible for graduation, each student must successfully complete all the above requirements within six (6) years following matriculation. The six (6) years allow for the completion of a Modified Course of Study due to medical, academic, behavioral or other leave of absence. The Dean may, in exceptional circumstances, grant an extension to this 6 -year rule. Professional and ethical competence is required for graduation. Students must demonstrate the ethical and professional qualities deemed necessary for success and continued study and practice of osteopathic medicine; the suitability for the practice of medicine by dutiful and responsible acceptance for patient care; and integrity in the conduct of clinical duties. Students may be dismissed from CUSOM if any of these competencies are not met. In addition, revocation of the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine degree may occur following graduation for discovered misconduct of prior students. Allegations of misconduct, which may result in a revocation of a granted degree, are considered by the Dean. This procedure is set forth in Section 6.7.7 of the Academic Bulletin. A student must complete all curricular requirements at CUSOM, or a minimum of two (2) years at CUSOM and another institution accredited by the Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation (COCA) or Liais on 245 Committee on Medical Education (LCME), between the date of matriculation and graduation. In addition to this requirement, the student must have been enrolled full -time at CUSOM during their entire third and fourth academic years. A CUSOM student must complete to the satisfaction of the faculty, as determined by the individual course directors, clinical rotation preceptors and through the APPS Committee, all prescribed courses and clinical experiences to graduate. The Dean makes the determination on an y student appeals of APPS Committee or Vice Dean recommendations, based solely upon new and meaningful information not available to the APPS Committee or Vice Dean at the time of the initial hearing and deliberation. Students must meet with the Assistant Director of Financial Aid and Registrar to complete all required exit documentation in order to receive a diploma. CUSOM students must also attend the exit process and commencement program in order to receive a diploma. Upon passage of COMLEX -USA Level 1, Level 2- CE, Level 2 -PE, and all other requirements as delineated in this Academic Bulletin, the Faculty of CUSOM, through the Dean and President, recommends degree candidates to the Board of Trustees. Upon approval of the recommendation, the Board of Trustees confers the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine degree on students successfully completing all requirements for graduation. 6.9.2 Delayed Graduation Policy If a student is suspended, takes a Leave of Absence, or is required to retake courses in the curriculum as a result of specific course or clinical rotation failures or a deficiency in overall academic performance, the student will be placed in a Modified Course of Study (MCOS). As discussed in Section 6.6.3, a Modified Course of Study (MCOS) is a credit -bearing, individualized study plan for students who require an alternative educational pathway for reasons such as board preparation, required remediation, illness, leaves of absence, or withdrawals. The institution of a MCOS may result in a delay in the scheduling and completion of a student's clinical rotations and graduation date. Voluntary course withdrawals, temporary leaves of absence, suspensions secondary to academic or non- academic matters, or failure to pass Board exams consistent with CUSOM policy may also result in a delay in the scheduling and completion of a student's clinical rotations and graduation date. Any alteration in the normal curriculum progression may affect a student's financial aid status or qualification for education- based financial aid. In addition, placement in a MCOS may impact the student's ability to participate in the residency match process. Specific counseling and advice should be sought from the CUSOM Office of Academic Affairs and the University's Office of Financial Aid for these or other indicated situations. 246 For Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine candidates who have grade point average of 2.000 or higher but who are lacking no more than thirty (30) credit hours of meeting all graduation requirements may file a \"Request to Participate in Commencement.\" Forms for this purpose are available in the Campbell University School of Osteopathic Medicine Registrar's Office. Candidates applying for the \"thirty (30) hour rule\" exemption must also file an Application for Graduation. If approved, the candidate will be allowed to participate in only one Commencement program for the degree in question. Furthermore, the candidate must understand that if approved for the participation in May or December Commencement, he/she will not be eligible to participate in any subsequent semester when he/she would have been eligible after having met all graduation requirements. Candidates participating under the \"thirty (30) hour rule\" will not receive graduation honors until all requi rements have been met and they have filed a new Application for Graduation for the term in which the degree will actually be conferred. For students to be eligible to participate in, but will not receive a diploma at, the May graduation ceremony, they must have taken COMLEX USA Level 2 -CE and Level 2 -PE prior to graduation with the results available no later than six (6) weeks following g raduation. 6.9.3 Hooding Policy This policy outlines the requirements for an individual to be allowed to hood CUSOM graduates conferred with the degree Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine. The Dean designates the specific hooders to participate in each Commencement ceremony. This includes participating immediate family members who may be approved to serve as a hooder as discussed below. All hooders of graduates receiving the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO) degree must be CUSOM Faculty or hold either the DO or Doctor of Medicine (MD) degree from an accredited medical school. Members of the graduation ceremony platform party who do not hold the DO or MD degree may be permitted to hood graduates upon approval by the Dean. Immediate family members who hold either the DO or MD degree from an accredited medical school may be permitted to hood graduates upon approval by the Dean. For the purposes of this Policy, an immediate family member is defined as a person who is connected to the graduate by blood or mar riage -- spouse, parent(s), parent -in-law, brother, sister, son, daughter, grandparent(s), aunt, uncle, cousin, nephew, niece, or sibling -in-law. Family hooders are required to wear appropriate academic regalia during the Commencement ceremony. Family ho oders who do not own their own regalia are responsible for any costs associated with the rental/purchase of regalia for the ceremony. 247 Students who participate in Commencement ceremonies outside of the CUSOM Commencement Ceremony in May will not be able to designate specific hooders for their Commencement ceremony (i.e., no family hooders at any graduation other than the May ceremony). These policies and procedures may change due to unforeseen circumstances. 6.10 Grievance Processes 6.10.1 Resolution and Grievance Proced ure CUSOM recognizes the need for students to voice grievances and to seek resolution to problems, disagreements with faculty/administrators, or interpretations of institutional policy. CUSOM also recognizes the responsibility of the student to express their concerns in a professional and ethical manner. Concerns may involve course grades other than a grade reviewed by the APPS Committee, promotion, behavioral issues, financial concerns or issues related to external (e.g. COCA, SACSCO C) accreditation standards and procedures. This grievance process shall not be used to appeal or review violations of the Honor Code or an appeal from the APPS Committee final decision by the Dean or the APPS Committee. All grievances must be filed in writing to the CUSOM Office of the Dean. All grievance material is securely maintained in the Dean's Office in a specific student/employee/faculty file as appropriate to the grievance. Each step of the Resolution and Grievance Procedure generally takes fourteen (14) calendar days to complete, unless otherwise noted. Extensions or waivers to this timeframe may be granted on a case- by-case basis. Notice of a request for an extension from a student must be submitted in writing to the Dean within ten (10) c alendar days prior to the deadline. Decisions regarding the request for an extension shall be communicated to the student via letter within two (2) business days of receipt of the request for an extension. Likewise, if CUSOM needs to extend a deadline, t he Office of the Dean shall provide said notice ten (10) calendar days before the due date. 6.10.2 Grievance for Academic Re solutions, Course Procedures, Grading Policies, and CUSOM Policies and Procedures 6.10.2 .1 Academic Issues An individual concern of an academic nature should be first discussed with the immediate instructor or preceptor and must be done in a professional manner. This concern generally includes those which arise from personal conflicts or actions taken against a student individually . For individual concerns, if resolution cannot be reached, 248 the student may, within fourteen (14) calendar days of the failed resolution, appeal, in writing to the appropriate Associate Dean for the academic year involved. If resolution cannot be reached from the prior appeals, the student may, within fourteen (14) calendar days of the failed resolution, appeal in writing to the Dean whose decision will constitute the final resolution. The Dean may refuse to meet with a student if the appeal has not been presented in writing, in advance of the meeting. A concern over general co urse procedures or grading policies should be addressed through the Class President to either the Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs or the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs . If a resolution cannot be reached through the normal processes for an accep table and reasonable request, the Class President may, within fourteen (14) calendar days of the failed resolution, appeal in writing to the Vice Dean for Academic Affairs . If resolution cannot be reached from the prior appeals, the Class President may, w ithin fourteen (14) calendar days of the failed resolution, appeal in writing to the Dean whose decision will constitute the final resolution. The Dean may refuse to meet with the Class President if the appeal has not been presented in writing, in advance of the meeting. Reminder : Course Assessment policies and test question challenges are not covered under student grievances. See course -specific syllabi for information regarding these issues. 6.10.2.2 CUSOM Policies and Procedures A concern over CUSOM policies and procedures should be addressed through the Student Government Association ( SGA) President and the Executive Director of Student Affairs . If through the normal processes for an acceptable and reasonable request, a resoluti on cannot be reached, the SGA President may, within fourteen (14) calendar days of the failed resolution, appeal in writing to the Dean whose decision will constitute the final resolution. The Dean may refuse to meet with the SGA President if the appeal h as not been presented in writing, in advance of the meeting. If the concern is financial, or with other areas of CUSOM, the student should follow the appropriate chain of command as defined by the CUSOM Organizational Chart. 249 6.10.3 Grievance Proced ure for Harassm ent or Discrimination Students who believe they have the right to exercise a grievance as described in Sectio n 6.10.1, or an academic grievance not described in Section 6.10.2, (hereinafter a \"Grievance\") shall use the Grievance Procedure as hereinafter set forth. Retaliatio n against any individual who files a grievance or participates in the grievance process is strictly prohibited. In the event a student or anyone who participated in the grievance process believes they have been subjected to retaliation, that individual may use the Harassment Grievance procedures listed below. Step One: The Resolution Process Students who meet the Technical Standards for admission to CUSOM, as described in this Academic Bulletin, and feel they have a Grievance shall first meet with the Executive Director of Student Affairs to explain their grievance. The student must schedule a meeting with the Executive Director of Student Affairs within fourteen (14) calendar days from the date of the action being grieved or the date the student should have known about the action to initiate this discussion. The G rievance complaint must be made in writing and signed by the person filing it. The Executive Director of Student Affair s shall in vestigate the G rievance within seven (7) calendar days . In the case where the discrimination is in any way threatening, the Executive Director of Student Affairs shall investigate the complaint and bring it to the attention of the Dean immediate ly for intervention. After the investigation period of seven (7) calendar days , the student filing the Grievance, and the person against whom the G rievance is filed shall meet with the Executive Director of Student Affairs to discuss an informal resolutio n. This meeting shall be scheduled within fourteen (14) calendar days of the initial filing of the G rievance. A letter confirming the mutual decisions of the resolution shall be distributed, within ten (10) calendar days of the meeting, to all persons and kept within the permanent student and or employee files for possible future issues that may arise with the resolution. If the Executive Director of Student Affairs determines there is insufficient evidence to support the allegations, he/she may close the G rievance and shall notify the student, within fourteen (14) calendar days , of his/her findings and inform the student of their right to request a G rievance Hearing. 250 The Executive Director of Student Affairs shall keep a record of the griev ance investigation, including all supporting documentation and a report of the findings. All material shall be filed as previously stated in this procedure. Step Two: The Grievance Hearing Process If the student feels the informal resolution has not been successful, or disagrees with the informal resolution, he/she may request the Executive Director of Student Affairs and the Dean to call a Grievance Hearing. The student has thirty (30) calendar da ys after receiving written notice of denial of the G rievance to request such a hearing. The request must be in writing, signed by the student, and include the following information: A clear and precise stat ement of the G rievance; A statement explaining how the action is discrimin atory or the decision unr easonable if it is a denial of a requested accom modatio n; The n ame the r esponde nt pa rties (the p erson(s)) against whom the Grievance is filed); An explanation of each responde nt respons ible for the action or decision; The requested re medy; and Any request to bring a non-participating observer to the heari ng. The request for an appeal shall not be based upon any evidence that the grievant had or was aware of at the time of the meeting with the Executive Director of Student Affairs . This information must be sent by certified mail or delivered with signature of receipt to both the Office of the Executive Director of Student Affairs and the Office of the Dean. Upon receipt of the request for a Grievance Hearing, the following processes shall be followed: The Dean shall designate the Vice Dean for Academic Affairs to review the case with in seven (7) calendar days to see if a peaceful and prompt r esolution can be made between the parties. In cases where th is cannot be accompl ished, the Dean shall appoint a Grievance Hearing Board, includi ng naming a Chair, at the end of the seven (7) calendar days. The Grievance Hearing Board shall be appointe d by the Dean who shall not ify the Grievance Hearing Board in writing, of their appoint ment and infor m them of the date of the hearing. The date of the heari ng shall be with in fourteen (14) calendar days of the notice. T he Dean shall ensure that those participating on the Grievance Hearing Board are not a part of the alleged discrimination or the denial of accom modations. The Grievance Hearing Board shall consist of a Chair, two Asso ciate Deans, two faculty memb ers, one staff member, and one student. 251 The person(s) against whom the G rievance is alleged shall receive a written copy of the G rievance at least s even (7) calend ar days in advance of the hearing. The Grievance Hearing Board shall hear the Grievance by the student. The p erson filing the Grievance, as well as the person against whom the Grievance is alleged sha ll at this time bring all witness es and/or evidenc e to the he aring for the Grievance Hearing Board to conside r. The Grievance Hearing Board shall also review document ation, including the final report fr om the Executive Director of Student Affairs relating to the Grievance, and, as necessa ry, shall interview the Executive Director of Student Affairs as a witness in t he Grievance. Neither party shall be entitled to have an attorney represent them at the hearing. Only the Chair shall be entitled to question any witness, and decide upon the relevancy of any evidence presented. Prior to convening the G rievance hearing meeting, the Grievance Hearing Board shall be trained on the specific G rievance hearing procedures relating to the individual G rievance and will be provided with additional educational material as appropriate. Following this initial hearing and presentation, if additional information is needed to render a decision, the Grievance Hearing Board may recess for a period of not greater than fou rteen (14) calendar days. The Grievance Hearing Board, or the Executive Director of Student Affairs at the request of the Grievance Hearing Board, shall conduct further investigation of the alleged Grievances. The Grievance Hearing Board may, during this time, meet with CUSOM's legal counsel. The second meeting of the Grievance Hearing Board, which shall occur within fourteen (14) calendar days, shall be to further discuss the G rievance, the investigation, the educational materials provided, and the advice of legal counsel. The Grievance Hearing Board may require second interviews with the person filing the G rievance or with those whom the G rievance is filed against. The Grieva nce Hearing Board shall make a final ruling at this meeting. Minutes will be taken of all Grievance Hearing Board meetings. A letter shall be sent to the student within fourteen (14) calendar days of the final determination by the Grievance Hearing Board . Step Three: Final Appeal Procedur e The parties have the right to appeal the decision of the Grievance Hearing Board to the Dean.

Student Policies and Services 7.1 Student Wellness As future physicians, it is important for CUSOM students to maintain good personal, physical, and mental health. With this in mind, CUSOM offers several services by which students may maintain their physical well- being. CUSOM encourages students to seek assistance for themselves or fellow classmates early if they encounter any physical health concerns. 7.1.1 Student Health CUSOM students are able to utilize the Campbell University Health Center for medical concerns; personal medical information is kept confidential in compliance with all HIPAA regulations. Student Health Center office hours can be found on the health center website: https://www.campbe ll.edu/health-center/ All students are required to maintain health insurance coverage from matriculation through graduation. For medical emergencies and after -hours healthcare, students are encouraged to access appropriate care as warranted by their situation including local Urgent Care facilities, Emergency Departments and Emergency Medical Services. In an emergency, students should access EMS and the 911- dispatch system. For students on Clinical Rotations away from CUSOM needing health services, please refer to Section 5.7.2 of this Bulletin . Further information may be found at: https://www.campbell.edu/health-center/ 7.1.2 Health Insurance All CUSOM students are required to have health insurance coverage. Before registration and before the beginning of class or rotations annually, all students must either provide proof of health insurance or purchase the health insurance made available through Campbell University. Any medical costs incurred by students as a result of needle sticks or exposure to infectious diseases or materials, while in training are the responsibility of the student and his/her health insurance carrier. Information on Campbell University Student Health Insurance can be found using the following link: https://www. campbell.edu/students/student-health- corresponding titers, prior to matriculation and remain compli ant with all vaccination requirements through graduation in order to complete all required supervised clinical practice experiences in the CUSOM curriculum. Regulatory and legislative authorities require students to demonstrate vaccination , immunity and/or protection from multip le contagious diseases before being allowed to participate in clinical experiences. CUSOM requires students to meet all vaccination requirements prior to matriculation and maintain compliance with these requirements through graduation. Descriptions of CU SOM vaccination requirements specifically addressing Diphtheria, Pertussis, Tetanus, Measles, Mumps, Rubella, Varicella, Hepatitis B, Influenza, and COVID -19 and testing for Tuberculosis are presented in Section 3.16 of this Bulletin . All incoming and curr ent students must log all vaccination requirements on the standard AAMC Standard Immunization Form, available at: https://www.aamc.org/download/440110/data/immunizationform.pdf This form must be completed in its entirety and signed by a physician or qualified healthcare provider verifying the required information. In addition, students are required to submit supporting documentation such as vaccination records and titers. Important Notes Regarding Vaccination Requirements - See Section 3.16. 7.1.4 Controlled Substance Screening Protocol Controll ed substance screeni ng of learners and sta ff memb ers is mandatory at most healthcare facilities prior to participating in patient care. As such, a controll ed substance screeni ng test showing no evidence of alcohol, illicit substa nces, prescription me dications without a valid prescription, or substances which are illegal in the state of No rth Carolin a is required before mat riculation into CUSOM and again before the start of Year Three of the program . Addit ional screening or confirmato ry tests m ay be required as determined by CUSOM or the clinical training sites. CUSOM reserves the right to require controll ed substance testing or a psychiatric evaluation on any student whe n there is an incident of erratic or unusu al behavior or there is a rea sonable conce rn due to ance, or pe rformance. Refusal or failure to submit to testing may result in disciplina ry action up to, and includin g, dismissal from the program. Students found to have screening tests posit ive for alcohol, illicit substances, and control led substances (define d as a drug or substance that is listed in Schedules I through V of the Federal 258 Controll ed Substances A ct (21 U.S.C. \u00a7812) ) or prescription medi cations without a valid prescription may be subject to disciplina ry action up to, and including , dismissal. Please note this also include s substances which are illegal in the state of North Carolin a but which m ay be legal in other states. For examp le, althoug h the use of m arijuana is legal in some states, the US Federa l Drug En forceme nt Agency lists it as an illegal drug. Its use or abuse impairs the ability of a healthcare professional to provide optimal care to his or her patients. As such, the use of ma rijuana in any form is a violation of University policy. CUSOM will provide clinical rotation sites with a copy of the results of any controll ed subs tance screening performed on studen ts prior to, and for the duration of, their placem ent at the site. By matriculating at CUSOM, studen ts grant CUSOM the right to share this information as deem ed appropriate. Clinica l education sites may set their own standards in regards to whom they will permit to participate in clinical rotations b ased on the results of the substa nce abuse screeni ng or require students undergo further testing. CUSOM has no control over the content of third- party background checks, which may include charges of Driving Under the Influence (DUI), Driving While Intoxicated (DWI), or similar offenses . Even expunged records may appear on these checks. Backg round checks revealing prior crimin al activity, even charges which may have been dismissed by the courts, could still result in consequences affecting clinical rotations, accepta nce into residen cy programs, future licensin g, specialty board ce rtification, or employment oppor tunities. If a student is unable to complete clinical rotations due to the inabil ity to pass controlled substance testing re quirements, he/she will not be capable of making academic progress or be able to meet graduation requirements . In addition, and as such, he/she will be referred to t he Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee for possible s anctions up to, and including, dismissal from the program . Prior to starting Year 3 (Clinical Rotations) : Students must have the controlled substance screening sample collected at a facility approved by CUSOM. If the test result is positive or shows other abnormalities, such as , but not limited to , excessively dilute urine, the Dean will appoint an ad hoc subcommittee, a subset of the CUSOM APPS Committee, to review the information and make a recommendation to the Dean regarding t he appropriate action. Depending on the decision, the student's advancement to the third year of the curriculum (clinical rotations) may be delayed based on the results. Results of controlled substance screenings are made available to clinical rotation s ites. By matriculating at CUSOM, students grant CUSOM the right to share this information as deemed appropriate. 259 All controlled substance screening tests are maintained in a secure location to ensure confidentiality. A ccess to this information is limited to the Executive Director of Student Affairs , the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs, the CUSOM Dean (or Vice Dean as the Dean's designee), and the Campbell University General Counsel. Results from positive controlled substance screens are shared with t he Director of Behavioral Health in the event the student requires drug/alcohol counseling. The entire cost of an y testing is the respons ibility of the student. If a student is unable to complete clinical rotations due to the inability to pass controlled substance testing requirements, he/she will not be capable of making academic progress or be able to meet graduation requirements. In addition, and as such, he/s he will be referred to the APPS C ommittee for possible sanctions up to, and including, dismissal from the program. 7.1.5 Infection Control Students exposed to infectious diseases should consult the Campbell University's Health Center (910) 893- 1560 for information regarding appropriate evaluation, testing , or treatment. Students presenting with signs or symptoms of infectious or communicable disease should consult with Campbell University's Health Center or the infection control office at the clinical s ite to determine if it is safe for them to continue providing care and if not, when it is safe to resume. Standard Precautions The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has developed precautions to prevent accidental spread of infectious disease in healthcare settings. These include standard precautions for all patient care and transmission- based precautions for situations in which s pecific infections are identified or suspected. A comprehensive description of these precautions is found on the CDC website at: https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/basics/index.html Standard precautions make use of common- sense practices and personal protective equipment to protect healthcare providers from infection and prevent the spread of infection from patient to patient; examples include, but are not limited to, the following: Handwashing (or using an antiseptic hand rub) After touching blood, bod y fluids, secretions, excretions and contaminated items; Immediately after removi ng gloves ; and Between patient contact 260 Compre hensive CDC guidelines for hand hygiene in healthcare settings are found at: https:// www.cdc.gov/ha ndhygiene/providers/ind ex.html Gloves For co ntact with body fluids, secretions and contaminated items; For co ntact with mucous membranes and non-intact skin Masks, goggles, face masks Protect mucous membranes of eyes, nose and mouth when contact with blood or bod y fluids is likely Gowns Protect skin from blood o r body fluid contact; Prevent soil ing of clothing during proc edures possibly involving contact with blood or b ody fluid Linen Handle soiled linen as to prevent touching skin or mucous membranes; Do not pre-rinse soiled linens in patient care areas Patient care equipment Handle soiled equipm ent in a mann er to prevent contact with skin or mucous membranes and to prevent contamination of clothing or the environment; Clean reusable equipm ent prior to reuse Environmental cleaning Routinely care, clean and disin fect equipment and furnishi ngs in patient care a reas Sharps Avoid recapping used needles; Avoid removi ng used needles from disposable syringes; Avoid bending , breaking, or mani pulating used needles by hand; Place used sharps in punc ture-resistant containers Additiona l is found resuscitatio n Use mout or other ventilation devices to avoid mouth- to-mouth resuscitation Patient placem ent Place patients who contaminate the environment or cannot maintain appropriate hygiene in private rooms Needle sticks Incidents involving needle sticks and potential exposure to blood- borne pathogens require immediate action to protect a student's health and safety. CDC guidelines for the prevention of blood- borne infectious disease following an exposure are found at: https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/bbp/emergnedl.html If a student sus tains a needle stick or is exposed to i nfectious m aterials he/she shoul d: Immediately w ash exposure site thoroughly with soap and water (or water only for mucous me mbranes). Immediately notify the clinical supervisor at the rotation site for assistance. Call/go to the Campbell University's Health Center or the occupational health clinic or area of the clinical facility designated for treating needl e stick exposur es. Time ly consultation concerni ng appropriate tests, risk-assess ment couns eling, and chemoprophylaxis decisions a re critical. Be evaluated immediately following an exposure event to determine if HIV post -exposure prophylaxis is appropriate. H IV post-exposure prophylaxis is most effective when initiated within the first fe w hours following an exposure so it is critical students are evaluated in a timely manner . This will ensure if post-exposure prophylaxis is indicated, then it is started as early as possible in order to increase its effectiveness. Proceed immediately to the Emergency Department for evaluation if exposure has occurred a fter normal business hours or, if for any other r eason unable to be evaluated at one of the a bove locations. Complete an incident report from the facility in which the incident occur red and ha ve a copy of the report sent to the Campbell University's Health Center (PO Box: 565, 129 T.T. Lanier St., Buies Creek, NC 27506). Send treatment and testing bills to the student's insurance compa ny. Students are responsible for all costs not covered by their insurance. CDC guidelines for the prevention of blood borne infectious dis ease follow ing an exposure are found a t: https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/bbp/emergnedl.html 262 In the event of an exposure, the National Clinician's Post-Exposu re Prophylaxis Ho tline (PEPline) is available by phone , (888) 448-4911, 11am-8pm Eastern, seven days per week to provide guidance in managing exposures. For exposures or questions that occur outside these hours, a PEP Quick Guide for Occupational Exposures is available at their website: http://nccc.ucsf.edu/clinician- consultation/pep- post-exposure - prophylaxis/ pr evention of inf ection transmission in health care settings are found at the following websites and should be reviewed carefully before participating in any patient care act ivities: https://www .cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/pdf/outpatient/ guide.pdf https://www .cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/ba sics/index.html safety of students, faculty, staff , and visitors to the Health Science Campus is of utmost concern and the utilization of a standard approach to medical emergencies will ensure the provision of the most timely, efficient, and appropriate care in a medical emergency. As a school of osteopat hic medicine, CUSOM's focus and expertise is in the domain of medical education. While many capable and compassionate health care providers are present on our campus on any given day, their role in this setting is as educators and administrators rather than as clinicians. While able to render immediate assistance in a life -threatening emergency, they should not be consulted to make treatment or disposition recommendations in non- emergent situations. Anyone suffering from a medical emergency must be eval uated by Emergency Medical Services (EMS) which is activated by dialing 9 -1-1. If anyone on the Health Science Campus suffers from a medical emergency, the person of first contact with the patient should dial 911 immediately to summon EMS assistance. Fol lowing activation of the EMS system, security must be notified of the situation and will also be responsible for contacting EMS to confirm the need for emergency response as well as to provide them with more detailed information regarding the location of t he patient and instructions for appropriate access to the building. Security will complete and maintain an incident report form for any situation in which EMS is called to provide assistance even if the patient ultimately refuses treatment and/or transpor t. Incident Reporting If a student suffers an accident resulting in an injury during a CUSOM activity while on campus, the student must complete an incident report, and call/go to the Campbell University's Health Center for consultation and assistance. Incident reports can be obtained from Campbell University's Health Center (910) 893- 1560. Medical Emergency Identified Call 911 Contact CUSOM Security for 263 If the accident occurs at a clinical training facility, that facility's incident report form should be completed, and the clinical supervisor, the Office of Clinical Affairs, the Regional Dean /Director of Student Medical Education (DSME ), and the CUSOM Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs should be contacted for assistance. A copy of the facility's incident report must be sent to: Campbell Student Health Services P.O. Box: 565 129 T.T. Lanier St. Buies Cr 27506 7.1.7 OSHA a nd HIPAA Training CUSOM is committed to ensuring the privacy and security of all patient health information as required by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). As such, all students are required to complete HIPAA training each academic year. To support our commitment to patient confidentiality, CUSOM and its clinical partners have developed processes to ensure appropriate steps are taken to verify the identity a nd authority of individuals and entities requesting protected health information as required under 45 C.F.R. \u00a7164.514(h) and other applicable federal, state, and/or local laws and regulations. Additionally, CUSOM ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its information systems containing electronic ally protected health information by implementing policies to prevent, detect, mitigate, and correct security violations. CUSOM is in compliance with the US Department of Health and Human Services' Privacy Rule as it applies to the creation, collection, use, or disclosure of all individual health information (whether identifiable or not) (\"Information\") in connection with CUSOM. In addition, CUSOM requires all students who have contact with patients receive OSHA Blood -Borne Pathogens (BBP) training which addresses the prevention of transmission of communicable pathogens. Students complete OSHA training annually during which time they review OSHA rules, requirements, appropriate plans and practices. CUSOM has the following plans in place: Blood-borne Pathogen Exposure Plan Infectious Waste Management Plan Biohazard Waste Management Plan The intent of these plans is to prevent blood- borne infections by eliminating or minimizing employees' and students ' exposure to blood, blood products, and other potential ly infectious mat erials. 264 7.2 Behavioral Health As future physicians, it is important for CUSOM students to maintain good personal, physical, and mental health. With this in mind, CUSOM offers several services by which students may maintain their behavioral health and well -being . CUSOM encourages students to seek assistance for themselves if they experience any personal behavioral health issues, or notify the Office of Student Affairs if they suspect a fellow classmate may be experiencing behavioral health concerns. 7.2.1 Counseling Services Confidential counseling services are available 24 -hours -a-day, seven -days-a- week in a confidential manner through a combination of resources which includes clinical services offered by the CUSOM Department of Behavioral Health (CUSOM BH) under the leadersh ip of the Departmental Chair and Clinical Director ( https://medicine.campbell.edu/behavioral -health ), and StudentLinc, a student assistance program. Working with Academic and Student Affairs, the Clinical Director for the Department of Behavioral Health, a licensed mental health professional, and other CUSOM Behavioral Health clinical staff are available during normal business hours for direct student contact. CUSOM Behavioral Health clinical staff are also available as a point -of-contact for after -hours issues in conjunction with StudentLinc described below. CUSOM Behavioral Health clinical staff provide counseling for CUSOM students in-person at Leon Levine Hall or via WebEx , which is a HIPAA - and FERPA -compliant telehealth platfo rm. In addition to publication in the Academic Bulletin, students are advised of the location of this service and how to access behavioral health services during Orientation as well as periodically throughout the year. More information regarding Behavior al Health services may be found at: https://me dicine.cam pbell.edu/behavioral-health Students on clinica l rotations who are unable to travel to the on-campus locations can meet with a CUSOM Department of Behavioral Health couns elor via WebEx, a secure v ideoconferencing system which meets HIPAA and FERP A standards . Thi s approach makes communicat ion with, and couns eling for, CUSOM st udent s on rotation s much more accessible and convenient. Students may also utilize video, phone or web- based counseling through StudentLinc. Couns eling is enco academ ic str ess, relationshi p probl ems, loneliness, depression, alcohol or substance abuse, sexuality conflicts, test anxiety and concer ns related to medical school adjustment .

The law states that a person with a \" disabil ity\" is: \"Someone with a physical or ment al impairm ent which substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual; or a person with a record of such impairm ent; or a person who is regard ed as having suc h an impairm ent.\" ( Section 50 4 of the Rehabilitation A ct of 1973) Equal educat ional opport unity me ans that a person with a disabilit y who is qualified for admission must have access to the same university programs, services, and activities as all other students. If necessary to provide equal opportunity, Campbell will make reasonable modifications to its policies, practices and procedures, unless doing so would fundamentally alter the nature of the service, program, or activity or pose an undue administrative or fina ncial burden. 269 Under the provisions of Section 504, unive rsities may not discriminate in the recruitme nt, admission, educat ional process, or treatment of students. S tudents who have self-identifie d, provide d document ation of disabili ty, and requested reasonable accom modations are entitled to receive approved modi fications of programs, appropriate academic adjustments, or auxiliary aids that enable them to participate in and benefit from all educat ional progra ms and activities. Section 504 specifies that unive rsities may not limit the number of students with disabilit ies admitted, make preadmissions inqui ries as to wh ether or not an applicant has a disabi lity, use admission tests or criteria that inadequately measure the academ ic qua lifications of students with disabilit ies because special provisions were not mad e, exclude a qualified student with a disabilit y from any course of study, or establis h rul es and pol icies th at may adversely affect studen ts wi th disabili ties. In support of its commitment to provide equal educational oppor tunity, Campbell provide s a variety of services and accom modations to students with document ed disabilit ies. C ampbell Univ ersity's Student Guide for Accessin g Disability Services can be accessed here. Questions or c omments about this manual should be directed to: Laura Rich Director of Disability Services Student Services, Section I: Wh C ontact ument ties who modations must c ontact the Director of Student Affairs : Jennifer Parrish O'Dell , MEd CUSOM Executive Director of Student Affairs Leon Levine H all of M edical Sciences, Room without approval through the University's pro cess. A medi cal, psycholog ical or other diagnosis may rise to the level of a disabilit y if it substantially limits one or more major life functions, one of which is learning. A dis ability may be tempor ary or ongoing. 270 7.2.3.2 Section II: Ho w to Obtain Services For any student deemed eligible, CUSOM provides accommodations or modifications to policies and practices in order to ensure that all students have equal access to all CUSOM programs, services, and activities. The purpose of accommodations is to provide access and equal educational opportunity for all students. Accommodations are not provided retroactively. Any student approved for accommodations is entitled to services and accommodations only from the date the approval is given. Even if the student can establish he/she had a disability at the time of the course in question, CUSOM will not expunge or re -examine coursework completed before the student was reviewed and approved for accommodation(s). No student is required to disclose his or her disability to the University. However, as discussed above, any student who discloses and receives approved accommodations after he/she has begun study at CUSOM will not receive any retroactive accommodations on work completed before the approval for accommodations was made. Documentation of a student's disability is only shared with relevant CUSOM faculty, s taff or administration on a need- to-know basis with a release of information signed by the student. General Procedur e for Receiving Acco mmodations Step 1: Incoming or current students are requested to contact the Executive Director of Student Affairs to request services as soon as poss ible. The Unive rsity is not responsible for identi fying students with disabilit ies and is not required to provide s ervices unless prope r pro cedures have been follow ed in ma king a request. Step 2: The student must schedule a meeting with the Executive Director of Student Affairs , who consul ts with the Director of Disability Services to provide document ation of the disability and to com plete the a pprop riate paperwork. Step 3: The Executive Director of Student Affairs reviews the student's request and supporting doc ument ation, if neede d. The process of review d epends in part on the nature of the student's disability. Decisions re garding accom modations are made on a case-by-case basis. There is no stand ard accom modation for any particular disability . CUSOM will make r eason able modifi cations to its policies, practices 271 and procedu res, unless doing so would funda ment ally alter the nature of the service, program, or activity or pose an undue administrative or fin ancial bu rden. Step 4: If the request for accommodations is approve d, the Executive Director of Student Affairs generates a Letter of Accom modation (LOA) do cumenting the student 's individual, approve d accom modations. The O ffice of Students Affairs coordi nates dissemination of the LOA. Any student whose requested accom modations are not approve d is encouraged to meet with the Executive Director of Student Affairs to discuss the reasons for the denial. The Executive Dire ctor may discuss the g rievanc e procedure with the student at this time. Service Animal Information According to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), a service animal is defined as \"any animal individually trained to work or perform tasks for the benefit of an individual with a disability, including, but not limited to, guiding individuals with impaired vision, alerting individuals to an impending seizure or protecting individuals during one, alerting individuals who are hearing impaired to intruders, pulling a wheelchair and fetching dropped items\". Providing comfort or support does not qualify an animal as a service animal. If there are any questions as to whether an animal qualifies as a service animal, a determination is made by Executive Director of Student Affairs with consultation with the Director of Disability Services . In compliance with the ADA, service animals are welcome in all buildings on campus and may attend any class, meeting, or other event. Service animals are expected to exhibit reasonable behavior while on campus. The owners of disruptive and aggressive service animals may b e asked to remove them from university facilities. If the improper behavior happens repeatedly, the owner may be told not to bring the service animal into any facility until they take significant steps to mitigate the behavior. Emotional support animals are animals that provide comfort and relieve symptoms of mental health disorders. Emotional support animals are not allowed in campus buildings, including classrooms and dining facilities unless it is deemed as a reasonable accom modation and will be included in the student's Letter of Accommodation (LOA) from CUSOM. The CUSOM Executive Director of Student Affairs can provide further information. 272 Cleanliness of any approved service or emotional support animal on campus is mandat ory. Consideration of others must be taken into account when providing maintenance and hygiene of animals. The owner is expected to clean up and dispose of all animal waste. If the service or emotional support animal become s a disruption to other students, the animal must be removed to a location that does not cause a disruption to the education of other students. Confidentiality of Information Information received from a student is governed under the provisions of the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act of 1974. Under the provisions of this law, students in post -secondary education have the right to inspect and review their school records as defined by law. Other than for \"Directory Information\", Campbell University will release information only with the student's written consent and/or in accordance with law, and will use \"Directory Information\" in the best interests of the student. CUSOM is committed to ensuring all information compiled concerning a student remains confidential as required by applicable law. Any information monitored or collected is used for the benefit of the student. Only those faculty and staff members of CUSOM have access to information collected for use in accomplishing necessary tasks for the student. Any information gathered is not released to third parties except in accordance with state and federal law. A student must give written authori zation to release info rmation he/she wish es to share with others. The student must specify the information to be released, the purpose of the release, and to whom the infor mation is to be fo rwarded. This release may be handwritten, or a form from CUSOM Office of Student A ffairs may be used. By matriculating at CUSOM, a student agrees that CUSOM may share their Match data. A student has the right to review his/her own file and as a courtesy to the individual, copies of documents and information obtained will be provided at no cost with limitations. 273 7.2.3.3 Section III: S tudent Responsibilities General Student Responsibilities 1. Identify him/herself to the Executive Director of Student Affairs to begin the process of requesting accom modations. CUSOM is not respons ible for identi fying students with disabilit ies or for contacting such students to begin the accom modation request process. 2. Provide document ation which conforms to the University's guidelines. If the student's document ation is insuf ficient for any reason, the student is respons ible for pursuing whatever additional document ation is required and to pa y any costs thereof. CUSOM r eserves the r ight not to provide services or accommodations until all of the documen tation specified in the guidelines is provided. 3. Any student approved for accommodations is r espons ible for retrieving his or he r Letter of A ccom modation (LOA) and Release of Information Form fr om the Executive Director of Student Affairs or available a t: https://cuweb.wuf oo.com/forms/cusom -release-of-information/ Responsibilities of a Student Approved for Testing Accommodations Testing accommodations require frequent communication between the student and the Office of Assessment, Accreditation and Medical Education (Years 1 and 2) or Department of Clinical Affairs (Years 3 and 4). It is very important that testing information be shared with these offices in a timely manner. At the beginning of the semester, and at least one week prior to the first scheduled quiz and exam , the student should discuss with the Office of Assessme nt, A ccredi tation and Medical Education or the D epartment of Cl inical Affairs all approved testing accommodations. This discussion should address the que stions of how, when and where the Office of Assessment, Accredi tation and Medical Education or the Department of Clinical Affairs will provide the testing accom modations. The student should make sure to have a calen dar and a copy of the L OA with him/her at the time of this discussion. The student should also remind the Office of As sessme nt, Accreditation and Medical Education or the Department of Cl inical Affairs of their need for accom modations at least one w eek prior to each quiz /exam . If at any time you feel that the Office of Assessment, Accreditation and Medical Education, or the Department of Clinical Affairs is not adequately meeting your accommodations, discuss this with 274 the Office of Assessment, Accreditation and Medical Education or Department of Clinical Affairs and the Executive Director of Student Affairs immediately. Remember, the Office of Assessment, Accreditation and Medical Education or the Department of Clinical Education is only required to provide accommodations specifically listed in the Letter of Accommodation. Responsibilities of a Student Approved for Handicapped Parking Students who use handicapped parking on campus must maintain state-issued handicap parking permits. The student is also required to purchase an appropriate parking sticker from the Campbell University Department of Campus Safety. If a student has consistent problems finding necessary handicapped parking near his/her class buildings, notify the Executive Director of S tudent Affairs and the Campbell University Department of Campus Safety immediately. 7.2.3.4 Section IV: Doc umenting a Disability General Do cumentation Guidelines To ensure re asonable and appropri ate services and accom modations are provid ed to students with disabilit ies, students requesting such accom modations and services must provide current document ation of their disability . S uch documentation gene rally must include the f ollowin g: A clear diagnosti c statement of the disability prepared by a licensed pro fessional A description of the mann er in which the disab ility limits the student in a specified major life activit y and the s everity of the limitation It is the responsibility of the student requesting the accommodations and services to document the disability. As such, the cost of evaluations required pursuant to these guidelines is to be borne by the student. If there is a change in the student's condition, he/she may request modifications to previously approved accommodations. The student will have to provide current supporting documentation for review at that time. An Individualized Education Plan (IEP) or a 504 plan may help to supplement documentation, but are generally insufficient documentation when presented alone. 275 Guidelines for Documenting a L earning Dis ability Every report should be on letterhead, typed, dated, signed and other wise legible, a nd be comprised of the following elements: Eval uator I nformation: The n ame, t itle, and credentials of the qualified pro fessional who conduc ted the a ssess ment should be gin the r eport. Please note that memb ers of the stude nt's family and CUSOM faculty and staff a re not conside red appropri ate evaluato rs. Recen t Assessment: The report m ust provide adequate information about the stude nt's current lev el of functioning. If such information is missing, the student may be asked to provide a more recent or compl ete assessment. Testing: There should be a discu ssion of all tests that were administe red, observations of the student's behavior during testing, and a listing of all of his/her test scores (i.e. domain, cluster, subtest, index, etc.) represented in standard scores and/or percentile ranks. Informal assessment, an Individualized Education Plan (IEP), or a 504 plan may help to supplement a more comprehensive test battery but are generally insufficient documentation when presented alone. In addition, a clinical summary and a clearly stated diagnosis are helpful and should be included in the report. The summary should integrate the elements of the battery with background information, observations of the client during the testing situation, and the student's current academic situation. This summary should present evidence of a substantial limitation to learning and explain how the patterns of strength and weakness are sufficiently significant to substantiate a learning disability diagnosis. It should also demonstrate that the evaluator has r uled out alternative explanations for the learning problem. If social or emotional factors are found to be possible obstacles to learning, they should be discussed. This summary may include recommended accommodations, but these are in no way binding to the University. CUSOM reserves the right to evaluate all documentation and determine appropriate accommodations in each case. 7.2.3.5 Section V: Grievance Proced ure for Accommodations All requests for accom modations or special services should first be brought to the CUSOM Executive Director of Student Affairs . Problem s with approve d accomm odations or services should first be reported in writing to the CUSOM Executive Director of Student Affairs . 276 If the student is unable to resolve the matter with the CU SOM Executive Director of Student Affairs , the student and the CUSOM Executive Director of Student Affairs should forward the compla int to the Director of Disability Services for an informal resolut ion. The Director of Disability Services will arrange a meeting with the student and CUSOM Executive Director of Student Affairs within ten ( 10) business d ays of receiv ing the compla int. If the student is unable to resolve the matter with the Director of Disability Services, the student and the Director of Disability Services should forward the complaint to the Vice President for Student Life for an informal resolution. The VP will arrange a meeting with the student and Director of Disability Services within ten (10) business days of receiving the complaint . In the event that the student is dissatisfied with the informal resolution, he/she may file complaint with the Vice President for Academic Affairs and Provost if the issue involves denial of an academic accommodation. Students are also encouraged to exercise their rights of complaint through the Department of Education, Office of Civil Rights and other legal channels if needed. 7.3 Clubs and Organizations 7.3.1 Student Clubs and Organizations Student clubs and organizations are a very important part of the Campbell University School of Osteopathic Medicine (CUSOM). The service performed by members of student organizations benefits not only the community and the region, but also the members, as they gain valuable knowledge, skills, and experience. Many CUSOM students are actively involved in at least one organization, and some students are members of several. CUSOM students may serve as officers or committee members at the state, regional or national level. The goals of student clubs and organizat ions relate to the Mission of CUSOM and the osteopathic profession. As such, the following are the endorsed student clubs and organizations at CUSOM: American College of Osteopathic Surgeons, Medical Student Section (ACOS -MSS) American Medical Association - Medical Student Section (A MA-MSS) Anesthesiology Interest Group (AIG) Campbell Med PRIDE (CMP) Christian Medical and De ntal Association (CMDA) Dermatology Club 277 Emergency Medicine Club (American College of Osteopathic Emergency Physicians (ACOEP) Family Medicine Club (ACOFP and AAFP) Global Health/M edical Missions Club Humanities in Medicine Club Internal Medicine Club (ACOI and AC P) Internal Medicine -Pediatrics Club (Med -Peds) Obstetrics and Gynecol ogy Club Pathology Club Pediatrics Club (American College of Osteopathic Pediatricians (ACOP)) Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Club (PM&R ) Point of Care Ultrasound Club (POCUS) Preventative Medicine Club Psychiatry Club Research Club Sigma Sigma Phi, Chi Upsilon Chapter Sports Medicine Club (American Osteopathic Academy of Sports Medicine (AOASM)) Student American Asso ciation of Osteopathy (SAAO) Student Association of Military Osteopathic Physicians and Surgeons (SAMOPS) Student Government Association (SGA) Student Interest Group in Neurology (SIGN) Student National Medical Association (SNMA) Student Osteopathic Medical Asso ciation (SOMA) Wilderness M edicine Club Women in Medicine Club The above list may not b e all-inclusive and is subj ect to change at any time.

Students may enter leadership roles beginning at the conclusion of Block 3 in Year 1 and transition their roles to the incoming leadership at the end of Block 6/start of Block 7 in Year 2. The cumulative GPA of each student wishing to participate in any o f the above roles is 278 reviewed by the Executive Director of Student Affairs and the Registrar after each academic Block and, if the cumulative GPA falls below 3.0, the student must relinquish his/her leadership role or other duties/privileges mentioned above. For an activity requiring pre -approval for participation, such as a mission trip or a research project, the cumulative GPA at the time of application for the activity is utilized; however, if the cumulative GPA drops below 3.0 by the start of the activity, the student may not be permitted to participate in order to allow them to focus on their academic well -being. CUSOM Student Government The Student Government serves as a voice for all students. The organization is open to all students and welcome s proposals and participation from the entire student body. The responsibilities of Student Government include collecting and expressing student opinions, acting as a liaison for the student body, promoting osteopathic medicine, supporting club and class a ctivities and working to improve the quality of life for all students at CUSOM. The Office of Student Affairs serves as the liaison between the administration and Student Government. Recognition of Student Organizations The first step in obtaining recognition for a new student organization is the submission of a petition to the Office of Student Affairs. The petition must include the goals of the organization, the proposed charter, and the name of the proposed faculty advisor. Once the petition has been approved by the Executive Director of Student Affairs , the petition is forwarded to the Dean for final approval.

The request form to use the school logo for any merchandise must be submitted to the Executive Director of Student Affairs who will process the request and grant final approval. Student Sponsored Ev ents Any event conducted by a student club or organization recognized by CUSOM is considered a student -sponsored event. Events of this nature require the approval of the Office of Student Affairs and requests must be submitted in writing to the Office of Student Affairs. Requests must include a statement of purpose and the facilities required for the event. Event scheduling forms requiri ng the use of institutional facilities are available through the Office of Student Affairs.

The Campbell Medicine Alumni Association may nominate two members to serve on the University Alumni Board of Directors. The Medicine Alumni Board will establish the bylaws, mission, vision and goals for the Campbell Medicine Alumni Association and work with the Alumni Office to add benefits for the Association and plan special events. They are the Alumni voice for Campbell Medicine in the Medical School and University communities. 7.3.5 CUSOM Committees Campbell University School of Osteopathic Medicine (CUSOM) values the talents, perspective and experience of its students and the positive contributions they make to key operational, academic, and improvement efforts of the school. As such, student participation and contributions are solicited whenever possible. Appointments to Committees differs from appointment as a student government representative or class leader, and appointment to, and service on, a CUSOM Committee should be considered a privilege. The process begins with the Office of Academic Affairs identifying student vacancies o n CUSOM Committees, as approved by the Dean, prior to the start of each academic year (and as vacancies arise within an academic year). Student members of CUSOM Committees must meet pre -identified criteria including, but not limited to, the student being in good standing at all times relative to: Academic standing: A cumulative GPA of 3.00 or higher on a 4.0 scale is required at the time of appointment. If the GPA falls below the minimum required for appointment at any time, the student will be asked to step down from service to focus on her/his academics. This requirement also includes COMLEX performance, and any student failing any level of COMLEX must relinquish their role on any CUSOM Committees. Professionalism: No student is permitted to serve on a CUSOM Committee if they are on Conduct Probation or otherwise have any issues related to Honor Code or Professionalism infractions. Committee service of students with an Admonition is determined based on the recommendation of the A cademic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee at the time the Admonition is assigned or by the APPS Committee Chair if an Admonition is assigned by the Chair instead of an APPS Committee hearing . If an appointed student has a documented professionalism issue at any time, the student will be required to step down from the committee service. 287 Other: All other requirements necessary to be a registered student in good standing, such as payment of tuition, must be met. First-year students may not serve on CUSOM Comm ittees, except in rare circumstances, until they successfully complete Block 2. At designated times in the first- and second -year of medical school, the class officers are asked by the Office of Student Affairs to solicit names of students who have intere st in the identified CUSOM Committees which include student membership. The Office of Student Affairs provides the charge of each Committee and the desired qualities of the ideal student member. Interested students submit materials addressing how they meet the stated needs of the Committee based on their interests and experiential base. These materials are submitted to the class officers at a time designated by the Office of Student Affairs in conjunction with the class officers. The class officers review all submissions in a fair, impartial, and unbiased manner, and send to the Office of Student Affairs their recommendations for no more than three (3) students they identify for each Committee vacancy. The Office of Student Affairs then works with the Office of Academic Affairs to ensure each student recommended meets all the stated prerequisites for service. Once verified, the names are forwarded to the respective Committee Chairs, who are given a brief timeframe to review the applications and select the student(s) they wish to invite to serve on the committee. The Office of Student Affairs will notify the students selected, as well as those not selected, of the outcome. All faculty and student committee appointments are subject to approval by the Dean. 288 8. Research and Scholarly Activity 8.1 Research at CUSOM Research is fundamental to, consistent with, and a prerequisite for excellence in teaching and the creation of a scholarly atmosphere for learning. CUSOM recognizes the critical role for develop ing its research capacity in order to continue to attract and retain top -tier faculty and students, thereby training students for productive careers in osteopathic medicine, biomedical research, and in making valuable contributions to society. Research an d scholarly activity at CUSOM may take different forms, which may include basic biomedical research, translational research, clinical research, and medical educational research. 8.2 Policy Statement on Student Research and Scholarly Activity CUSOM strives to advance scientific and medical knowledge and to promote the distinctive philosophy and practice of osteopathic medicine. Whereas CUSOM specifically supports the academic and scholarly pursuits of students and faculty, this policy specific ally addresses student research and scholarly activities. CUSOM does not require students to complete an independent research project or scholarly activity as a requirement for graduation. However, CUSOM is committed to supporting students in pursuing re search and extracurricular scholarly opportunities. Whereas students are encouraged to participate in research, students are not permitted to act as a principal investigator (PI). Rather, they must partner with a faculty member or preceptor who takes on the role of PI. Furthermore, CUSOM requires all students who are interested in engaging in research to notify the Associate Dean for Research of their intent. As such, student -researchers are provided with an additional layer of oversight and support in addition to their faculty or preceptor mentor. 8.3 Education in Research Principles Research processes, compliance practices, and principles of responsible conduct in research (RCR) are presented in the Foundations of Medical Practice (FMP) course throughout Years One and Two. Topics include general principles of research ethics, statistical methods, project development, human subject protections and the responsibilities of CUSOM students in basic science , educational , and clinical research. Additional educational opportunities in research, scientific method, statistics, and scholarly activities are presented throughout the curriculum and through workshops associated with extracurricular research activities. As activ e members of a research team, students may be required to complete the associated CITI training, if appropriate. If such training is required, the student must provide the Associate Dean of Research with documentation of completion prior to beginning work on the project. Additional training specific to the research project will be provided by the research mentors. 289 8.4 Research Opportunities CUSOM students may pursue research and scholarly activities in many areas of individual interest. Faculty mento rs in areas of biomedical and clinical research are available to provide guidance for student scholarly work. The faculty mentor has overall responsibility for the conduct of research or scholarly activity and is ultimately responsible for obtaining approval from regulatory committees as needed. As such, CUSOM requires that a faculty member approve all scholarly activity undertaken by students; however, student and faculty investigators may share the responsibility for complying with policies related to research ethics. For a student -initiated project, the student must have a faculty or preceptor sponsor, who will serve as the project PI and student mentor. The student may prepare the relevant proposals and a pplications in close cooperation with the mentor. Mentors and students are responsible for conducting their research in accordance with University and institutional affiliates' research policies. Students wishing to earn credit for biomedical research, c linical research or other scholarly activities may enroll in the Research (Independent Study) elective during the fourth year. Description of the course requirements are available in the syllabus and elsewhere in this Academic B ulletin. Students particip ating in the research clerkship elective must comply with all appropriate regulatory requirements, which may include Institution Review Board approval prior to initiation of the project. Students and their faculty mentors are responsible for knowing which compliance requirements are appropriate. 8.5 Medical Student Summer Research Scholars Program Each year a limited number of 7 -week paid research fellowships are available to CUSOM medical students during the summer between their MS -1 and MS -2 years. These opportunities are designed to expose students to basic science, clinical , osteopathic manipulative medicine, or simulation medicine research to gain valuable experience in research and explor e various clinical disciplines. Students are incorporated int o the laboratories or educational setting to work with fulltime CUSOM faculty or are placed in CUSOM clinical sites to work with practicing physicians. The S cholars Program is designed to help medical students acquire a greater understanding , and applicat ion, of methodologies which support healthcare innovation and to envision themselves as physician scientists. The program is competitive. Students accepted into the program will attend an RCR training workshop, participate in weekly work -in-progress sessions, work on a full -time basis during the summer months and receive a stipend at the conclusion of the summer. All Summer Scholars are encouraged to present their work at a local, regional, or national symposium. 290 8.6 Student Presentation Processes Students are encouraged to share the results of their research through publication and presentation of their projects. The Associate Dean for Research oversees research publications and scholarly activities of students. Students are required to receive approval from the Associate Dean for Research prior to presentation or publication of any research project conducted while a CUSOM student. For meeting submissions, the final version of the abstract must be submitted and approved by the faculty mentor and the Associate Dean for Research. The Associate Dean for Research must review and approve all compliance requirements before submission of the abstract for any meeting. For manuscript submissions (case report, original research, or any other publication), the final manuscript draft must be submitted and approved by the Associate Dean for Research prior to submission to any journal for consideration of publication. The final poster, presentation or manuscript must be reviewed and approved by the faculty mentor and all listed co -authors. The author(s) and mentor must be up -to-date on research compliance processes. Failure to adhere to any of these requirements will be considered professional misconduct and will be reported through the appropriate channels for consideration by the APPS C ommittee as described elsewhere in this Bulletin . 8.7 Research Symposium Campbell University and CUSOM has a tradition of highlighting and showcasing student research interests. Annually, Campbell University hosts the Campbell University Interprofessional Education (IPE) Symposium, which is an adjudicated competition open to students, residents and faculty. The IPE research symposium is an opportunity for students to see other projects from their fellow students, as well a s projects from other healthcare fields.
