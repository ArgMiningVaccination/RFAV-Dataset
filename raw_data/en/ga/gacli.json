These infections can cause potentially serious illness in young children, older adults, and people with chronic conditions. Because of this, it's important for many people to get vaccinated against pneumococcal disease. There are two different types of pneumococcal vaccines that are used in the United States. Both types have been proven to be safe and effective at protecting you from pneumococcal disease. Like all vaccines, the pneumococcal vaccine can have side effects. However, the side effects are usually mild and typically resolve in a few days. Depending on the vaccine that's administered, side effects can vary, but the most common side effects of the pneumococcal vaccine include: - redness or pain at the site of the shot - mild fever - fatigue - headache Let's take a closer look at pneumococcal disease, the different pneumococcal vaccines, and their potential side effects. Pneumococcal disease is caused by a specific type of bacterium called Streptococcus pneumoniae. It's most common in children, but can also cause significant complications in older adults or people with chronic conditions. The pneumococcal bacterium is contagious, which means that it can be passed from one person to another. This typically happens through direct contact with respiratory secretions like saliva or mucus. Developing a pneumococcal infection can lead to a variety of conditions, some of which can be life threatening. Conditions caused by pneumococcal infections include: [pneumonia](/health/bacterial-pneumonia) - bloodstream infections ( [bacteremia](https://post.healthline.com/health/septicemia)) Now let's take a closer look at the different types of pneumococcal vaccines. Vaccination against a pneumococcal infection helps prevent you or your child from becoming sick from pneumococcal diseases. It also aids in preventing these diseases from spreading within your community. Vaccination can't always prevent all cases of pneumococcal disease. Nevertheless, according to the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/pneumo/public/index.html) There are two vaccines available for pneumococcal disease: PCV13 (pneumococcal conjugate vaccine) This vaccine provides protection against 13 strains of pneumococcal bacteria that commonly cause disease in children and adults. It's given as 4 doses in children and 1 dose in adults. PCV13 is recommended for: - children under 2 years old - adults ages 65 and older, after a discussion with their doctor - people ages 2 to 64 with certain health conditions, such as diabetes mellitus, HIV, or chronic conditions of the heart, kidneys, liver, or lungs PPSV23 (pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine) This vaccine defends against 23 strains of pneumococcal bacteria. It's typically given as 1 dose. It's recommended for: - adults ages 65 and older - people ages 2 to 64 with certain health conditions, such as diabetes mellitus, HIV, or chronic conditions of the heart, kidneys, liver, or lungs - adults between the ages of 19 and 64 who smoke tobacco products As with any vaccine, you may experience some mild side effects after receiving the pneumococcal vaccine. Mild side effects vary depending on which vaccine you receive. The side effects will usually go away within a few days. Possible side effects of the PCV13 vaccine include: - redness or discoloration, pain, or swelling at the site of the shot - mild [fever](/health/fever) [chills](/health/chills) [headache](/health/headache) [drowsiness](/health/drowsiness) [decreased appetite](https://www.healthline.com/health/appetite-decreased) of the PPSV23 vaccine include: Sometimes an adult or child can have a serious allergic reaction ( [anaphylaxis](/health/anaphylaxis)) to the pneumococcal vaccine, but this is very rare. Allergic reactions to any vaccine are very rare. The CDC estimates they occur in about [1 in 1 million](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/pneumo/public/index.html) Symptoms of a severe allergic reaction typically occur shortly after receiving the vaccine. Severe symptoms can include: [difficulty breathing](/health/breathing-difficulties) [wheezing](/health/wheezing) - rapid heart rate - if you may [faint](/health/fainting) [clammy skin](https://www.healthline.com/health/skin-clammy) [anxiety](https://www.healthline.com/health/anxiety)or a [feeling of dread](https://www.healthline.com/health/feeling-of-impending-doom) [confusion](https://www.healthline.com/health/confusion) If you or your child develops any of these symptoms following vaccination, seek prompt medical attention. The [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/pneumo/public/index.html) The first dose is given at 2 months old. The subsequent doses are given at 4 months, 6 months, and between 12 to 15 months. Common side effects in babies following PCV13 vaccination can include: [fussiness](/health/baby/fussy-baby)or irritability - tenderness, redness or discoloration, or swelling at the site of the shot - a decrease in appetite - disrupted sleep - sleepiness or drowsiness - mild fever On very rare occasions, serious side effects can occur, such as high fever, [convulsions](/health/febrile-seizure), or a [skin rash](/health/how-to-spot-and-take-care-of-your-babys-rash). Contact your child's pediatrician right away if you notice any of these symptoms. What to do if your child is unwell after the vaccine It's possible that your child may feel unwell after receiving a dose of the pneumococcal vaccine. Should this happen, there are ways to help ease their symptoms. If your child has a fever, try to keep them cool. You can do this by providing cool liquids for them to drink and ensuring they're not wearing too many layers. Tenderness, redness or discoloration, and swelling at the site of the shot can be eased by applying a [cool compress](/health/make-cold-compress). To do this, wet a clean washcloth with cool water and place it gently on the affected area. Symptoms like fever and pain at the site of the shot may be alleviated using over-the-counter medications like acetaminophen ( [Tylenol](/health/baby/infant-tylenol-dosage)) or ibuprofen ( [Motrin](/health/childrens-health/infant-motrin)). Be sure to use the infant formulation and to carefully follow the dosing instructions on the product packaging. Prior to being approved for use, the safety and effectiveness of all vaccines must be rigorously evaluated in [clinical trials](/health/clinical-trial-phases). Let's take a look at some of the research into the effectiveness of pneumococcal vaccines. A [2016 study](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(16)00052-7/fulltext) - The vaccine effectiveness of PCV13 against the 13 pneumococcal strains included in the vaccine was 86 percent. - The vaccine effectiveness against pneumococcal disease due to any strain of S. pneumoniae was 60.2 percent. - The effectiveness of PCV13 didn't differ significantly between children with and without underlying health conditions. A [2021 research review](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14760584.2021.1880328) analyzed the findings of studies on the effectiveness of PPSV23 that were published between 2010 and 2020. It found that PPSV23 is effective against the pneumococcal strains included in the vaccine. However, effectiveness may be lower in individuals that are ages 75 or older and people with underlying health conditions. According to studies, the vaccine effectiveness of PPSV23 against strains included in the vaccine ranges from 60 to 70 percent. The CDC also notes that more than [80 percent](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/pneumo/hcp/about-vaccine.html) Pneumococcal vaccination is recommended for the following groups: - all infants and children younger than 2 years old - adults over 65 years old - people who have long-term or chronic health conditions, such as diabetes mellitus or significant cardiovascular disease - individuals with weakened immune systems - adults who smoke tobacco products Be sure to speak with your doctor about which pneumococcal vaccine is right for you or your child. Some people shouldn't receive a pneumococcal vaccination. You shouldn't get the PCV13 vaccine if you're: - currently feeling ill - have had a life threatening allergic reaction to any of the following: - a previous dose of PCV13 - an earlier pneumococcal vaccine called PCV7 - a vaccine containing the diphtheria toxoid (such as [DTaP](/health/dtap)) - any components of the PCV13 vaccine You shouldn't receive the PPSV23 vaccine if you're: - currently feeling ill - have had a life threatening allergic reaction to any of the following: - a previous dose of PPSV23 - any components of the PPSV23 vaccine If you're concerned about an allergic reaction, ask your doctor to provide a list of the vaccine's components. Pneumococcal disease can potentially cause life threatening illnesses in children, older adults, and people with chronic conditions. There are two vaccines available to protect against pneumococcal disease. Which vaccine is given depends on the age and health status of the individual receiving it. Side effects of the vaccine are often mild and resolve in a few days. In very rare cases, a severe allergic reaction may occur. Be sure to talk with your doctor about which pneumococcal vaccine is appropriate for you or your child. "}
