Strawberries They may stain your shirt, but they could work to whiten teeth, since they contain an enzyme called malic acid. Try mashing up strawberries and rubbing them on your teeth. Leave for five minutes then rinse with water and brush and floss as usual. 2. Apples, celery and carrots These healthy fruits and veggies act like natural stain removers by increasing saliva production, which serves as the mouth's self-cleaning agent. They also may kill bacteria that causes bad breath, and their crunch factor works to scrub teeth clean. 4. Baking soda One 2008 study found toothpastes that contain baking soda \u2014 long considered a tooth-whitening home remedy \u2014 do a better job of removing plaque than toothpastes without the ingredient. To try it, your best bet is brushing with a commercial paste that contains the mild abrasive. Or, once in a while, you can just brush your teeth with baking soda straight from the box. 5. Yogurt, milk and cheese Dairy products contain lactic acid, which may help protect teeth against decay. A study in the journal Dentistry found kids who ate yogurt four times per week had less tooth decay than kids who didn't eat yogurt. Researchers think proteins in yogurt may bind to teeth and prevent them from attack by harmful acids that cause cavities. Hard cheeses are best for whitening, since they help remove food particles as well. Jennifer Nelson is a Florida-based writer who also writes for Glamour, MSNBC and WebMD.
