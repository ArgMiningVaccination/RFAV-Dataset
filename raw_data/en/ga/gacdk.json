This is the first Defense summary justification volume of its kind. Its purpose is to inform Congress and provide the American peop le a clear understanding of how their tax dollars are being invested to provide for our Nation's defense. It includes: An explanation of the Depa rtment's missions, accomplishments, and priorities; A summary of the request by Milit ary Department and Defense agency; Information on special areas of interest and emphasis for Fiscal Year 2009; and Details on the Department's major weapons programs. The Military Departments and Defense agencies will provi de Congress with additional detailed justification materials on this request. The requested funds would: provide military pay, be nefits, and world-class healthcare for 2.2 million Soldiers, Sailors, Marines , and Airmen ($149.4 billio n); support military operations and force readiness ($158.3 billion); invest in strategic modernization ($183.8 billion); and supp ort family housing and facilities ($23.9 billion). In addition to the $515.4 billion re quest, the Administration requests $70 billion for an emergency allowance for the Global War on Te rror. Details will be provided to Congress once the specific needs of our troops on the ground are better known. Ho wever, it remains imperative that Congress complete action on the remaining $102.5 billion Fiscal Year 2008 Global War on Terror request. Further delay in providing these funds will have a detrimental e ffect on our military's ability to carry out its vital missions. Robert M.

mission of the Department of Defense (DoD) is to defend the United States and provide for the security of the American people. In times of peace, the Department fulfills this mission by anticipating threats and challenges to the Nation's security. The military trains and equips the forces needed to deter aggression and advance U.S. interests around the globe. In times of war, the goal is victory over our adversaries. Since 2001, the Department has been engaged in developing the forces and capabilities that the Nation needs to meet the threats and challenges of the 21st century; at the forefront of these challenges is fighting the Global War on Terror (GWOT). THE DEPARTMENT'S MISSION The Department fulfills its mission by following the guidance of the President's National Security Strategy (NSS) and, in turn, the National Defense Strategy (NDS). The NSS describes an approach to U.S. defense based on two pillars: 1) promoting freedom, justice, and human dignity by working to end tyranny, promote effective democracies, and extend prosperity; and 2) confronting the challenges of our time by leading a growing community of democracies. The NSS identifies nine tasks for the national security community, and the Department plays a critical role in four of these tasks: Strengthening alliances to defeat global terrorism and working to prevent attacks against the U.S., our Allies, and our friends; Working with others to defuse regional conflicts, including conflict intervention; Preventing our enemies from thr eatening the U.S., our Allies, and our friends with weapons of mass destruction; and Transforming America's national security institutions to meet the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century. The Department also contributes to achieving five additional goals: Championing aspirations for human dignity, including ending tyranny and promoting e ffective democracy; Igniting a new era of global economic growth through free markets and free trade; U.S. Army photo by Sgt. Brandon Aird - December 2007A U.S. Army Soldier runs under a CH-47 Chinook helicopter while hooking up equipment during an airlift mission at Forward Operating Base Fenty in Jalalabad, Afghanistan DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 OVERVIEW 2 Expanding the circle of development by opening societies and building the infrastructure of democracy; Developing agendas for cooperative action with other main centers of global power; and Engaging the opportunities and confronting the challenges of globalization. These tasks translate into several mission areas for the Department in support of a common goal: protecting American lives and U.S. interests. The attacks of September 11, 2001 and subsequent events have awakened the Nation and the Department to the need for new modes of thinking and active measures to detect, disrupt, and respond to potential attacks, whether from terrorist groups, adversary states, or cyber attackers. The preeminent struggle of our time is the global effort to defeat violent extremism. For our sake and that of future generations, the Nation must prevail in the Global War on Terror. The central fronts in the GWOT remain Iraq and Afghanistan. Since 2001, over one million Service members have been deployed in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF). The U.S. and its Coalition partners in the GWOT remain committed to establishing a stable, democratic, and secure Iraq and Afghanistan. Both countries are allies in the GWOT, and the U.S. will assist each nation to provide for its own security. In Iraq and Afghanistan, Coalition forces continue to work alongside Iraqi and Afghan security forces to provide security for their people and the relief from violence needed to advance political reconciliation and economic improvements. The Department continues to help organize, train, equip, and sustain the Iraqi and Afghan National Armies and Police, as these nations develop the capacity to provide for their own security and stability and establish the rule of law. In other regions around the world, the U.S. is working with partner countries to defeat terrorist cells, build local capacity, and eliminate terrorist safe-havens. That work has yielded results in diverse areas including the Philippines, Pakistan, Lebanon, the Horn of Africa, and the Trans-Sahel. In addition to prosecuting the current fight and institutionalizing the lessons learned from irregular conflicts, the Department must ensure that the U.S. can respond to state-based aggression by maintaining the ability to prosecute complex campaigns, including the use of conventional military capabilities. In addition to the personnel currently engaged in Iraq and Afghanistan, thousands more are stationed throughout the world ensuring security, deterring aggression, assisting partner nations, and at the ready to respond to crises and disasters. In concert with U.S. Allies and partners, the Department deters conflict and promotes security, which is fundamental to peace and economic growth. During the Cold War, stability was the product of a balance of power between two superpowers with thousands of nuclear weapons. Since the end of the Cold War, the dampening effect of the superpowers on instability has lifted, and conflicts based on religion, ethnic strife, and power politics have expanded. The new security environment requires a multi-faceted and multi-dimensional approach to deterring conflict and coercion that relies on all instruments of national power. The focus of this volume will be on the military element of national power. THE DEPARTMENT'S ACCOMPLISHMENTS Since 2001, the Department has made remarkable progress in advancing these missions and pursuing a multi-dimensional approach. It has: Removed two brutal regimes, reduced terrorist safe havens, DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 OVERVIEW 3 and captured or killed terrorists who threatened the U.S., the American people, and our interests around the globe; Adapted effectively to evolving, asymmetric threats, improved our ability to conduct counter-insurgency operations, and maintained our effectiveness in more traditional warfighting tasks; Developed a new National Defense Strategy and established or reorganized four Combatant Commands to lead the GWOT, transform the military, protect the homeland, defend against long-range attack, and engage in Africa; Launched the most significant transformation of the Army in a generation, transitioning from a Division-based Army to more lethal, agile, and capable Brigade Combat Teams; Provided battlefield commanders with unprecedented situational awareness through the development of the Global Information Grid - a net-centric information infrastructure that enables rapid data processing and analysis; Fielded a broad range of unmanned aerial vehicles that perform reconnaissance, strike, and force protection activities, transforming the way U.S. forces fight; Developed and procured new technologies that detect, disarm, destroy, and protect against improvised explosive devices; Transformed America's global defense posture, enabling forces to deploy quickly in times of crisis and ensuring a new global military presence prepared for 21st century challenges; Continued to maintain and sustain an initial Missile Defense system to protect the U.S., our Allies, friends, and deployed forces against attack; Delivered aid to millions affected by natural disasters, at home and abroad; Converted over 31,000 military positions to civilian positions to relieve strain on the military force and ensure all military personnel are performing \"military essential\" activities; Transformed its financial management into a high-performing enterprise program that delivers critical information to decision-makers and warfighters to achieve mission success; U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class R.J.

Nowell Jr., Co mmodore of Africa Partnership Station (APS), along with the international APS staff, congratulates Ghanaian Navy Petty Officer 1st Class Bennet Botchway Obro after completion of leadership training from Expeditionary Training T eam, in Tema, Ghana. APS is scheduled to bring international training teams to Senegal, Liberia, Ghana, Cameroon, Gabon, and Sao Tome and Principe, and will support more than 20 humanitarian assistance projects in addition to hosting information exchanges and training with partner nations during its seven-month deployment. DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 OVERVIEW 4 Established the National Security Personnel System, now serving 130,000 civilian employees, to create a flexible and responsive 21st century national security workforce; and Eliminated, via privatization or military construction, over 90 percent of all inadequate domestic military family housing units By end of Fiscal Year (FY) 2009, the Department will eliminate all inadequate family housing in the U.S. THE DEPARTMENT'S PRIORITIES Today's strategic environment is defined by a struggle between the civilized world and extremist terrorist networks. However, other challenges remain and are growing. These threats include the proliferation of irregular challenges, rogue states' quest for nuclear weapons, and the rise of regional military powers. The FY 2009 President's Budget provi des the resources necessary to address today's challenges and anticipate future threats by funding the following priorities: Prevail in the Global War on Terror; Increase Ground Combat Capability; Improve Force Readiness; Develop Future Combat Capabilities; and Improve Quality of Life for Service Members and Families. Prevail in the Global War on Terror To ensure freedom and security and advance peace and stability throughout the world, the U.S must succeed in Iraq and Afghanistan and work with Allies and partners to prevail in the ongoing struggle. Military success in the GWOT requires a wide range of capabilities including: a highly trained, mobile, agile fighting force that is well-versed in counterinsurgency operations; financial flexibility through programs like the Commander's Emergency Response Program; airlift and global reach; sophisticated targeting, tracking, and locating capabilities; the ability to acquire and rapidly field appropriate technologies; and state of the art force protection equipment. The U.S. will enjoy an even higher likelihood of success if our partners are able to defend themselves, deny terrorist sanctuary within their borders, and participate in coalitions. The Department is committed to developing these capabilities and providing the warfighter the right resources whenever and wherever they are needed. Increase Ground Combat Capability Recognizing that threats to U.S. security exist beyond the war on terror in Iraq and Afghanistan, the U.S. military must be structured to meet current and projected needs. At the direction of the President, the Department is increasing the size of the Army and Marine Corps. This enhancement to ground forces will increase the Nation's combat capability and significantly increase the amount of time that Soldiers and Marines can spend at home with their families between deployments. The growth in the Army and Marine Corps is a continuation of the \"Grow the Force\" initiative first funded in the FY 2007 budget. Improve Force Readiness To ensure warfighting capability is ready when the Nation calls, the Department will sustain and improve force readiness. Equipment is central to maintaining U.S. military warfighting capabilities. The Department must ensure force readiness by rapidly repairing or replacing this equipment and providing critical equipment and technology for future deploying forces. In addition to being properly equipped, the Department must maintain operational readiness of our forces through increased recruitment, retention, and training efforts and position those personnel so that they are ready to respond to unexpected contingencies. DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 OVERVIEW 5 Develop Future Combat Capabilities The Department must be ready to meet future threats from land, sea, air, or space and to address new realms of conflict, such as cyberspace. To ensure its ability to respond to state-sponsored or other aggression, the U.S. must continue strategic modernization to maintain its significant advantages in conventional war capabilities and work to prevent adversaries from acquiring or using weapons of mass destruction, particularly nuclear weapons. Through research and development, the Department must identify new technologies to ensure its comparative advantage. Improve Quality of Life for Service Members and Families The Active, Guard, and Reserve components of our military forces are critical to the Department's ability to meet military objectives. Success in everything we do depends upon the dedication and skill of the men and women who willingly sacrifice their own comfort and safety to safeguard the freedom Americans enjoy every day. The Department is focused on recruiting, training, educating, supporting, and retaining the finest military force in the world. The Department's focus on people includes: 1) sustaining an all-volunteer force with more predictable deployment schedules and the high quality benefits that they deserve; 2) ensuring an appropriate mix of personnel for the mission; 3) rewarding civil service performance through the National Security Personnel System and new Senior Executive Service system; and 4) implementing programs that will bring the best possible care and medical facilities to our wounded warriors. SUMMARY The Department operates in a complex environment with multiple crosscutting missions. In spite of the challenges this presents and six years of continuous operations in support of the Global War on Terror, the Department's Soldiers, Sailors, Marines, Airmen, and civilians have accomplished a great deal to advance the security of our Nation and that of our Allies and friends. The FY 2009 President's Budget funds critical capabilities that will enable the Department and the U.S. to prevail in the current conflict, while preparing for future contingencies.

U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 1st Class Jason McKnight - December 2007 JUSTIFICATION DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 JUSTIFICATION 6 Justification The FY 2009 President's Budget requests $515.4 billion for the Department of Defense. This is a $35.9 billion increase over the FY 2008 appropriated level, a 7.5 percent nominal increase in funding (5.4 percent real growth) (Figure 1.1). The Department's request is 3.4 percent of projected U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP), one of the lowest levels of funding for any comparable period of conflict (Figure 1.2). The Department's request funds non-GWOT costs associated with the U.S. Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force. It supports the activities of the 10 Combatant Commands (including the recently established Africa Command), the majority of funding for the U.S. Intelligence Community, and the Department's 33 agencies, field activities, and specialized offices. (All numbers in this volume are budget authority unless otherwise indicated and do not include emergency supplemental appropriations). In addition to the $515.4 billion request, the Administration requests $70 billion for an emergency allowance for the Global War on Terror. Details will be provided to Congress once the specific needs of our troops on the ground are better known. Since September 11, 2001, Congress has appropriated $636 billion for the GWOT. This funding provides for the incremental costs for military and intelligence operations, force protection, training, overseas facilities and base support, communications, transportation, maintenance, supplies, weapons and equipment refurbishment or replacement, and other essentials. The funds also support deployed personnel with special pay and benefits, food, medical and other services, and training and equipping of Iraqi and Afghan security forces. In FY 2008, Congress appropriated $86.8 billion or 46 percent of the President's $189.3 billion request for GWOT. Congress has not yet appropriated the remaining balance - $102.5 billion - requested for U.S. forces in combat (Figure 1.3). These additional funds are required to pay our military, continue 302328375 2008 Remaining GWOT Request ($103B) Numbers may not add due to roundingFigure 1 .1 Historical Budget and GWOT Funding $ 1417FY08 GWOT activities appropriated in supplementals Source: Defense Appropriation Acts Budget Request; FY 2008 GWOT Defense Budget Estimates for FY 2008106-145*+$35.9B +7.5%+$35.9B +7.5% Figure 1.2 Defense Outlays as a Percentage of GDP in Times of War Source: Historical Tables, Budget of the US Government FY 2008; FY 2009 Budget Request Notes: FY 2008 and beyond use President's Budget request rather than outlays; FY 2009 figure does not include GWOT funding106-631945 1965 1985 2005 1945 1965 1985 ($70B) DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 JUSTIFICATION 7 operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, reconstitute our force, provide for protection for our troops, and fund the Iraq and Afghan security forces. A CHALLENGING ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT As the world's largest unified global enterprise, the Department and its funding are directly affected by the U.S. and world economies. External economic fact ors such as inflation, fuel costs, and currency fluctuations diminish the value of appropriated funds and strain military readiness. Internal fiscal trends, such as the rising cost of healthcare, contribute to the economic challenges facing the Department. Inflation. While inflation throughout the last decade has been relatively low, escalation of purchase price inflation affects the Department's overall purchasing power. Approximately $10.0 billion - about 2 percent of the Department's $515.4 billion request - can be attributed to inflation. Fuel Cost Increases. The Department is one of the world's largest purchasers of fuel. It feels the impact of rising crude oil prices, which have more than tripled in the past four years. The Department's FY 2008 projected fuel cost is $15.1 billion for 122 million barrels, including refinement costs. The FY 2009 budget request projects fuel cost of $14.1 billion for a comparable number of barrels of fuel as in FY 2008. While FY 2009 fuel prices are forecasted to be lower than FY 2008 prices, they are still significantly higher than last year's projections for FY 2009 of approximately $67.60 per barrel. Currency Fluctuations. The Department is a global organization with a foreign currency exposure of $5.9 billion. This includes funding for payrolls, housing, and operations in nine different foreign currencies. The impact of currency fluctuation has been negative in recent years due to the relatively weak value of the dollar. This will increase the cost of foreign operations by $238 million in FY 2009. Military Healthcare. The Department remains concerned with the cost of providing healthcare. Healthcare funding included in the FY 2009 budget request is $41.6 billion. Projections indicate that military healthcare costs will increase by 5 to 7 percent per year through FY 2013 if no changes are made to the current healthcare program fee and benefit structure. This continued growth is largely due to: - Increasing use of the healthcare benefit by eligible beneficiaries who previously elected not to use it; - Healthcare inflation and higher utilization of healthcare services; and - Expanded benefits authorized by Congress, such as TRICARE for Reservists. As these costs increase, more of the Department's budget is likely to be spent on healthcare and less on warfighting capabilities and readiness.

The Department continues to realign U.S. global defense posture to better contend with post 9-11 security challenges by transform ing overseas legacy forces, Cold War basing structures, and host-nation relationships into a flexible, forward network of capabilities with Allies and partners. These efforts include: Continued force posture realignments within and from Central Europe which enable advanced training and lighter, more flexible ground capabilities to support NATO's own transformation goals; Shifting our European posture south and east by transforming the 173rd Airborne Brigade in Italy and establishing a headquarters and infrastructure support for rotational presence in Romania and Bulgaria; Setting conditions for future realignments in the Pacific as part of U.S.-Japan force posture changes that will have far- reaching, beneficial impacts for the alliance; Continued consolidation and reduction of forces on the Korean peninsula to strengthen our overall military effective- ness for the combined defense of the Republic of Korea; Developing base infrastructure for new deterrent and other capabilities in Guam, Hawaii, and Alaska; and Developing basic infrastructure and capabilities for current and future operations in the Central Command (CENTCOM) area of responsibility and GWOT operating regions. The Department continues to maintain strong host-nation support for these posture changes. We must also build and strengthen the military and security capabilities of these and other global partners to increase the effectiveness of U.S. forces and provide a formidable combination of actual and potential power. 106-29+2.2% in billions)U% FY09 FY08 New Initiatives ($ in billions) - 0.4 0.1 AFRICOM* - 0.8 - Building Partnership Capacity - 0.3 - BMD - European Site Nat'l Cybersecurity Initiative - 1.5 - Total Initiatives (excluding Classified) - -0.5 - Aircraft Retirement - -1.2 - Healthcare Fees - -1.7 - Total Savings the Army +7.3% Department of the Navy +7.1% Department of the Air Force +5.1% Defense-Wide Agencies +7.5% Total Request by Component+6.4% Military Pay & Healthcare +10.4% Ops, Readiness & Support +4.7% Strategic Modernization +18.5% Family Housing & Facilities +7.5% Total Request by CategoryU% FY 2009 Budget in billions)U% FY09 FY08 New Initiatives ($ in billions) - 0.4 0.1 AFRICOM* - 0.8 - Building Partnership Capacity - 0.3 - BMD - European Site Nat'l Cybersecurity Initiative - 1.5 - Total Initiatives (excluding Classified) - -0.5 - Aircraft Retirement - -1.2 - Healthcare Fees - -1.7 - Total Savings the Army +7.3% Department of the Navy +7.1% Department of the Air Force +5.1% Defense-Wide Agencies +7.5% Total Request by Component+6.4% Military Pay & Healthcare +10.4% Ops, Readiness & Support +4.7% Strategic Modernization +18.5% Family Housing & Facilities +7.5% Total Request by CategoryU% FY 2009 Budget ($ in billions) Source: FY 2008 Defense Appropriation Act, FY 2009 Budget Request.

While the Department continues to present its budget detail by these accounts, this volume seeks to organize data into broader categories for the ease of the general reader. The categories tie to the traditional appropriation accounts, yet are more intuitive for the general reader. These categories will appear through this volume in each of the Department and Defense-Wide chapters. A cross-walk between appropriation accounts and categories is provided in the Resource Exhibits at the end of this volume (p. 213-4). Accordingly, the $515.4 billion budget request is divided into four functional categories (Figure 1.4): Military Pay & Healthcare; Operations, Readiness & Support; Strategic Modernization; and Family Housing & Facilities. Military Pay & Healthcare ($149.4 billion) Competitive compensation and world-class healthcare are essential to attract and retain the all-volunteer force. The Department requests $149.4 billion, or 29 percent, of its FY 2009 request for military pay, benefits, and healthcare. Military Pay and Benefits ($107.8 billion): Military pay and benefits (e.g., housing allowance) for 2.2 million Active and Reserve Soldiers, Sailors, Marines, and Airmen, including funding for increasing U.S. ground forces to strengthen the Army and Marine Corps (with the exception of healthcare benefits, included below). Healthcare ($41.6 billion): Funds the Defense Health Program ($23.6 billion) to sustain the best healthcare program in the world for 9.2 million eligible beneficiaries, including Medicare-eligible beneficiaries, and medical military construction and personnel. Operations, Readiness & Support ($158.3 billion) The Department is sustaining critical readiness to ensure it can respond to military contingencies. The Department requests $158.3 billion, or 31 percent, of its FY 2009 request for operations, readiness, and support. Readiness ($68.0 billion Readiness, $33.1 billion Support Activities): Daily military operations such as ship steaming days (45 days per quarter), tank miles (608 driven per year, up from 459 in FY 2008), and aircraft flight hours (13.9 per month for Air Force fighters, 14.5 for bombers) at a high rate of operational tempo (Figure 1.5, p. 14). $158.3 $183.8$23.9$149.4Figure 1.4 Budget by Category $515.4BMilitary Pay & Healthcare Family Housing & Facilities($ in billions) Strategic ModernizationOperations, Readiness & Support 29% 31% 35%5% Source: FY 2009 Budget Request Numbers may not add due to rounding See cross-walk on pages 213-4 for detail on how the categories tie to appropriation.106-SP DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 JUSTIFICATION 10 Base Operations and Facility Maintenance ($32.6 billion): Basic operation and maintenance of bases worldwide. Facility sustainment is budgeted at 90 percent. Equipment Maintenance ($11.8 billion): Increased maintenance of equipment at 75 percent of depot maintenance requirements. Also funds the transition of systems from development to fielded systems. Training, Recruiting, and Retention ($10.7 billion): Full spectrum training, combat training center rotations, and recruiting and retention efforts to maintain combat readiness, and attract and retain Service members possessing critical skills. Revolving Funds for Ongoing Operations ($2.2 billion): Funding is required in revolving funds for war reserves ($0.2 billion), commissary operations ($1.3 billion), vessel investments and expenses through the National Defense Sealift Fund ($2.0 billion), and a net transfer from the National Defense Stockpile Fund to the Defense Health Program (-$1.3 billion). Strategic Modernization ($183.8 billion) Maintaining our technological edge today is central to military superiority in the future. The Department requests $183.8 billion, or 35 percent, of its FY 2009 request for strategic modernization, which includes procurement and research and development. Aircraft ($45.6 billion): The FY 2009 request continues the implementation of the Administration's long-term tactical aircraft acquisition plan and advances development and procurement of three advanced tactical aircraft: 1) Air Force F-22 Raptor; 2) F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF); and 3) Navy F/A-18E/F Super Hornet. The budget supports procurement of aircraft including the Navy EA-18G Growler, the modernization of the A-10 Thunderbolt, tactical and strategic aircraft, and the new air refueling tanker. Communications and Mission Support Systems ($68.5 billion): Our air, sea, and land systems need to be able to communicate securely and effectively, necessitating the continued development of Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) systems, including the Joint Tactical Radio System. Funding for mission support equipment, which includes items such as night vision goggles and howitzers, sustains critical technologies that enable an effective military force and a high state of readiness. Ground Vehicle ($9.2 billion): Ground capabilities - including tanks, personnel carriers, armored vehicles, and trucks - and support equipment are fully supported in the FY 2009 budget. Key initiatives include development of the Army's Future Combat Systems, upgrades to the Abrams and Stryker weapon systems, and armored High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWVs). Missile Defense ($10.5 billion): The request continues to support the development and testing of an increasingly integrated Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) ($10.0 billion) and procurement and development of Patriot missiles ($0.5 billion). BMDS provides protection for the U.S., our Allies, and deployed forces from attacks by ballistic missiles of all ranges in all phases of flight. Munitions and Missiles ($11.0 billion) Funds for munitions and missiles builds tactical, strategic, and conventional weapons, ensuring the Department's ability to defend against threats and strike military targets. Shipbuilding and Maritime Systems ($16.9 billion): The goal of the shipbuilding program is to acquire a 313-ship Navy fleet by FY 2020. In support of this program, the FY 2009 request includes procurement funding for eight ships. These include two Joint High Speed Vessels (one for DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 JUSTIFICATION 11 the Army), one DDG 1000 Zumwalt Class Destroyer, two Littoral Combat Ships, one Virginia Class Submarine, and two Lewis and Clark Class (T-AKE) Auxiliary Dry Cargo ships, and construction of the first of the CVN-21 class. Space-Based and Related Programs ($10.7 billion): The space program provides communications, navigation, missile warning, space situational awareness, and environmental monitoring capabilities. The FY 2009 request includes funding for the next generation early warning satellite (Space Based Infrared System), communicat ions satellites (Advanced Extremely High Frequency (EHF), Wideband Global Satellite, Transformational Communication Satellite), and Global Positioning Satellite Block IIF and III. Science and Technology ($11.5 billion): The Science and Technology program responds to the present day needs of the Department and warfighter, while providing the foundation for superior future capabilities. The FY 2009 request of $11.5 billion is a 7 percent increase over the FY 2008 request, but a decrease compared to the enacted level. This year, the Department increased its investment for the Basic Research segment of Science and Technology by nearly $0.3 billion to $1.7 billion. As the rest of the world invests more in research, the risk of technology surprise against U.S. capabilities is increasing. The investment in Science and Technology and Basic Research, in particular, provides insurance against an uncertain future. Family Housing and Facilities ($23.9 billion) Caring for the warfighter, their families, and the facilities in which they work and live is essential. The Department requests $23.9 billion, or 5 percent, to improve and maintain family housing and facilities. Family Housing ($3.2 billion): Funds eliminate inadequate units overseas, operate and maintain government-owned housing, and privatize 12,324 family housing units. Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Implementation ($9.5 billion): Includes 24 major realignments, 25 base closures, and 765 lesser actions. Funding will pay for military construction and operation and maintenance to relocate personnel and equipment, conduct environmental studies and remediation, and install communications, automation, and information management system equipment in support of construction projects. Maintain Training Centers and Base Infrastructure ($11.2 billion): Maintenance of training centers and infrastructure, including construction in support of the Army and Marine Corps Grow the Force initiative at Forts Hood and Riley and Camp Lejeune. NEW INITIATIVES FOR FY 2009 The budget includes a number of new initiatives to increase national defense. These include: Establishment of Africa Command (AFRICOM); Building Partnership Capacity; Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) European Site; and Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative. Establishment of AFRICOM ($0.4 billion) This year, the Unified Command Plan was revised to establish AFRICOM. The Department requests $0.4 billion to continue the standup of AFRICOM, which will reach Full Operational Capability (FOC) in FY 2009. AFRICOM will strengthen U.S. security by assisting the African people with developing peace and security, through engagement that promotes their health, education, and economic growth. Unlike a traditional Combatant Command (COCOM), AFRICOM will focus on building regional security and crisis response DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 JUSTIFICATION 12 capacity and will include a significant number of representatives from other U.S. agencies within its staff, including officers from the Department of State and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). AFRICOM funding in FY 2009 would provide for: Operation of the AFRICOM Headquarters; A special operations command for the AFRICOM theater of operations; Operational support aircraft to provide dedicated access to one of the world's largest continents; Establishment of two of five proposed regional offices on the African continent; Training, exercises, and theater security cooperation activities; and An information/intelligence analysis capability to aid the Commander and assist with security. Building Partnership Capacity ($0.8 billion) Building Partnership Capacity (BPC) includes programs to build the capacity of foreign partners to counter terrorism and promote security. Congress provided $0.3 billion of $0.5 billion requested in the FY 2008 budget in the FY 2008 GWOT appropriation. The Department is requesting $0.8 billion in the FY 2009 budget for a variety of BPC programs to: Reduce stress on U.S. forces by helping partners to solve problems before they become crises; Multiply the global force by allowing partners to manage their own security problems; and Improve the effectiveness of U.S. forces by teaming with foreign partners that know the local language, culture, and political terrain. The primary elements in this initiative are: Global Train and Equip ($0.5 billion): Global Train and Equip programs allow Combatant Commanders and Ambassadors to train and equip foreign military forces to respond to urgent and emergent threats and opportunities to solve problems U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist Seaman Ash Severe - November 2007The citizens of Bamna, Bangladesh, wave good-bye to the crew of a CH-46E Sea Knight helicopter after the crew delivered over 20 bundles of clothes to help aid the victims of Tropical Cyclone Sidr. The amphibious assault ship USS Kearsarge (LHD 3) and the embarked 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit (Special Operations Capable) are conducting humanitarian assistance/ disaster relief efforts in response to the government of Bangladesh. The Department of Defense effort is part of a larger Unit ed States response coordinated by the U.S. Department of State and U.S. Agency for International Development. DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 JUSTIFICATION 13 before they become crises requiring military intervention. Combatant Commanders consider this the single most important tool for the Department to shape the environment and counter terrorism outside Iraq and Afghanistan. Security and Stabilization Assistance ($0.2 billion): This authority and funding allows the U.S. to provide assistance to partners, such as the State Department, that compliments efforts in other non-military ar eas to promote stability and to reduce terrorist space and influence. Assistance is often provided in the same places in which U.S. forces are operating or may be forced to operate if conditions worsened. Combatant Commanders Initiative Fund (CCIF) for Urgent Humanitarian Relief and Reconstruction ($0.1 billion): CCIF is an authority similar to the Commander's Emergency Response Program, which allows the Department to provide funds for urgent and unanticipated humanitarian relief and reconstruction assistance, particularly in a foreign country where the armed forces are engaged in a contingency operation. In addition to the $0.8 billion of new BPC programs, the Department is requesting continuation of other programs that support engagement and help ensure the long-term sustainability of our capacity building initiatives, including the Regional Centers for Security Studies. Ballistic Missile Defense - European Site ($0.3 billion) To improve the security of U.S. forces deployed overseas and to support Allies in the region, the Department continues to realign BMDS and plans to deploy the third BMDS site in Europe. The Department requests $0.1 billion for Military Construction of the BMDS-European Interceptor Site. The request will fund site preparation on the missile field and provide facilities for a complete Ground-Based Mid-Course Defense System capability. An additional $0.1 billion is requested for Military Construction of the European Mid-Course Radar site. This would fund site preparation of the installation and mobilization of the general contractor to construct a new European radar site for operations against potential threat trajectories. Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative (Multiple Departments) The global information environment that the Department relies on for mission success is the same environment in which our Allies and adversaries operate. There is no meaningful distinction between \"friendly\" cyberspace and \"hostile\" cyberspace. Securing cyberspace will require us to not only reduce vulnerabilities by strengthening information assurance, but to put a new focus on addressing the threat posed by entities that seek to do harm to the U.S. No single U.S. Government (USG) entity can successfully address the threat; it must be a concerted effort across the Federal government. To that end, the Administration established the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative in 2007. Spearheaded by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the initiative seeks to improve the security of all Federal networks through the coordinated efforts of multiple Departments and Agencies. To support the initiative, the FY 2009 budget increases funding for selected cyber security activities. The Department will play a critical role in this initiative through enhancing the security of Defense networks and by supporting other Departments and Agencies as necessary. INCREASED INVESTMENTS FOR FY 2009 Grow the Force (+$8.7 billion): In FY 2009, $20.5 billion, an increase of $8.7 billion over enacted FY 2008 levels, will provide needed resources to Grow the Force . This funding will help to increase Army active end strength to 532,400, which includes an increase of 7,000 Soldiers over FY 2008, and increase Marine DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 JUSTIFICATION 14 Corps active end strength to 194,000, which includes an increase of 5,000 Marines over FY 2008. This growth will strengthen combat capabilities, meet global force demand, and reduce stress on our forces by increasing the amount of time between deployments. To stand up and sustain the additional Army and Marine Corps forces, the FY 2009 request includes an additional $4.5 billion for pay and benefits, $2.8 billion for operations and support, and $2.9 billion for infrastructure. Training and Readiness (+$5.7 billion): In FY 2009, $5.7 billion will provide enhanced readiness for active forces across the Department (Figure 1.5). Measured in terms of tank miles, flying hours, and ship steaming days, readiness includes: An increase of $1.1 billion for the Army to increase tank miles and support flying hours, provide more robust full spectrum training, and accommodate force mix changes to maintain readiness status for Soldiers in the training cycle; An increase of $0.7 billion for the Navy to support the Fleet Response Plan, fund 45 days underway per quarter for deployed ships, support a net increase of three ships, and continue to increase additional force capability through a new Naval Expeditionary Combat Command; An increase of $0.2 billion for the Marine Corps to provide full spectrum training and capability to maintain readiness status for Marines in the training cycle; An increase of $0.9 billion for the Air Force because of changes in aircraft mix, decreasing crew flight hours per month while increasing flight simulation use, and changes in live fire training programs and consumption rates. Flying hours are fully funded; and An increase of $2.8 billion for readiness support including necessary logistical support provided by the Defense Information Systems Agency, Defense Logistics Agency, Defense Contract Management Agency, and Defense Threat Reduction Agency; space, combat, and weapons support; Special Operations Command (SOCOM) and Joint Staff support; and lift and prepositioning support. Military Pay Raise (+$2.7 billion): In FY 2009, $2.0 billion will provide for a pay raise for Service members equal to the Employment Cost Index (ECI) as of September 30, 2007. The ECI is based on the wages and salaries for private industry workers. This sets the FY 2009 pay raise at 3.4 percent. Total funding for military pay raises in FY 2009 is $2.7 billion, of which $2.0 billion is due to the January 1, 2009 pay raise of 3.4 percent and $0.7 billion is due to the annualization of the January 1, 2008 pay raise of 3.5 percent.

The FY 2008 pay raise was increased by Congress by 0.5 percent over the President's requested level of 3.0 percent to 3.5 percent. BRAC Implementation (+$1.9 billion): In FY 2009, $1.9 billion will increase BRAC efforts above the FY 2008 level of $7.5 billion. This includes funds to execute realignments and closures for the approved BRAC 2005 Commission recommendations and to satisfy utilizing land sales revenue. The Department has fully funded BRAC 2005 requirements throughout the six-year implementation period (FY 2006 through FY 2011) consistent with detailed business plans developed by the assigned business plan managers. The Department anticipates recurring savings of about $4.0 billion annually after full implementation in FY 2011. Basic Allowances for Housing and Subsistence (+$1.6 billion): In FY 2009, $1.6 billion will provide for a 5.0 percent increase ($1.2 billion) in the Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) and a 3.8 percent increase ($0.4 billion) in the Basic Allowance for Subsistence (BAS), which are tax-free, cash allowances that compensate military personnel for housing costs and daily meals. The increase reflects inflation and maintains entitlement programs at current standards. Facility Sustainment (+$0.6 billion): In FY 2009, an additional $0.6 billion of facilities sustainment funding will provide for the maintenance and repair activities necessary to keep the Department's facilities in good working order (e.g., regularly scheduled maintenance, major repairs, replacement of facility components). Funding at this level achieves 90 percent of the Facilities Sustainment Requirement for the Department, which is the minimum acceptable level; full sustainment continues to be the goal. Anything less than this will result in continued deterioration and degradation of existing facilities and will not provide for a maximum return on investment in new facilities. Strategic Modernization (+$8.3 billion): In FY 2009, an additional $8.3 billion will provide a wide range of modernization (including procurement and research and development) efforts across the full spectrum of warfighting capabilities. Some of the top programs include: A Navy F/A-18C Hornet aircraft is a bl ur as it rushes past a flight deck crewmember while catapulting from the flight deck of the aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman (CVN 75) during operations in the Persian Gulf . DoD photo by Petty Officer 3rd Class Ricardo J. Reyes - January 2008 DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 JUSTIFICATION 16 Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) (+$1.3 billion): The FY 2009 request includes $2.3 billion, $1.3 billion increase over FY 2008 for SBIRS. SBIRS is a constellation of four satellites, two in Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO) and two hosted payloads in Highly Elliptical Orbit (HEO). This system will enhance collection of data and reporting of ballistic missile launches around the globe. SBIRS will replace the legacy Defense Support Program (DSP). The initial launch of SBIRS is planned for the first quarter of FY 2010. FY 2009 funding continues the assembly, integration, and testing of the first two GEO satellites, operational testing of the first HEO payload, and development of the ground segment. Virginia Class Submarines (+$0.2 billion): The FY 2009 request for the Virginia Class Submarine program is $3.6 billion, a $0.2 billion increase over FY 2008. One new Virginia Class submarine is scheduled in FY 2009, and the Department has budgeted to commence a two per year build rate in future years. These submarines seek and destroy enemy ships across a wide spectrum of scenarios, working independently and in consort with a battle group and other ships, providing joint commanders with early, accurate knowledge of the battlefield. The Navy plans to procure 30 boats through FY 2019 to replace Los Angeles SSN as they reach the end of service life. CVN 21 Carrier Replacement (+$0.8 billion): The FY 2009 request for the CVN 21 is $4.2 billion, an increase of $0.8 billion over FY 2008. Aircraft carriers provide credible, sustainable, independent forward presence during peacetime without access to land bases. They operate as the cornerstone of a joint and/or allied maritime expeditionary force in response to crisis and carry the war to the enemy through joint multi-mission offensive operations. Like its predecessor, the Nimitz class, CVN 21 will carry approximately 90 aircraft. However, due to automation, it will require fewer sailors to operate. Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) (+$0.6 billion): The FY 2009 request for the LCS is $1.3 billion, a $0.6 billion increase over FY 2008. LCS will be a fast, agile, stealthy surface combatant capable of operating in support of anti-access missions against asymmetric threats in the littorals or near-coast line areas. It will be able to engage small attack boats and provide mines countermeasures and littoral anti-submarine warfare. New Tanker Program (+$0.8 billion): The FY 2009 request for the New Tanker program is $0.9 billion, a $0.8 billion increase over FY 2008. The New Tanker program begins replacement of the KC-135 aerial refueling fleet, which has an average age of 47 years old. The Department will procure 179 new tankers to replace roughly one-third of the current tanker fleet. The New Tanker will be able to provide fuel to joint and coalition receivers via a boom or drogue system on every mission and will augment the airlift fleet with cargo, passenger, and medical evacuation capabilities. VH-71 Presidential Helicopter (+$0.8 billion): The FY 2009 request for the VH-71 Presidential Helicopter is $1.0 billion, a $0.8 billion increase over FY 2008. The program includes a fleet of 28 aircraft by 2019. This helicopter will replace the current Presidential Helicopter fleet and provides safe and timely transportation for the President. It will enable the President to execute the duties of office while in transit by providing a wide range of communications systems. It will be capable of operating in adverse climatic and environmental conditions and provide unique survivability capabilities. It will incorporate executive accommodations, such as dignified entry and exit. FY 2009 budget requests for major weapons systems are included later in this volume. DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 JUSTIFICATION 17 BUDGET SAVINGS FOR FY 2009 Aircraft Retirements (-$0.5 billion): In FY 2009, the Department plans to retire 357 aircraft, with a total cost avoidance of $0.5 billion. The Air Force proposes retiring 182 aircraft, which will generate an estimated FY 2009 savings/cost avoidance of $0.4 billion. The retirements include a number of legacy platforms and will permit the Air Force to continue recapitalization and transformation of its air, space, and cyberspace capabilities. The Army and Navy propose retiring 135 and 40 aircraft, respectively. Both Department's will replace them with more modern airframes. Approximately $0.1 billion in savings will be re-applied to the newer aircraft operation and support costs. Healthcare Fees (-$1.2 billion): The budget includes $41.6 billion to provide high quality healthcare to 9.2 million eligible beneficiaries. To sustain this program, the budget proposes adoption of the recommendations made by the Task Force on the Future of Military Health Care in December 2007, including higher co-pays for beneficiaries' prescriptions and enrollment fees and deductibles. The Department's healthcare costs more than doubled from $19 billion to $42.8 billion between FY 2001 and FY 2009 and are projected to reach $64 billion by FY 2015 if no changes are made. This growth would mean that the percentage of the Department's budget devoted to healthcare will grow from 6 percent in 2001 to 11.3 percent by FY 2015. Although active duty military members receive benefits, most costs for military healthcare are driven by military retirees and their beneficiaries. It is projected that, by FY 2011, up to 65 percent of spending will go toward retirees (including Medicare eligible retirees), up from 45 percent in FY 2001. Cost U.S. Army Spc. Megan M.

This issue will remain a challenge over the next several years and the Department continues to seek legislative relief to sustain the healthcare benefit. PROGRAM TERMINATIONS FOR FY 2009 The FY 2009 budget does not propose any major program terminations. SUMMARY The Department's FY 2009 budget request: Maintains a highly trained fighting force of 2.2 million Soldiers, Sailors, Marines, and Airmen; Recruits, trains, and equips 65,000 additional active duty Soldiers and 27,000 additional Marines over five years; Provides pay increases of 3.4 percent for military members, improves benefits for the all-volunteer force, and provides pay increases of 2.9 percent for the civilian workforce; Provides world-class healthcare for 9.2 million eligible Service members, families, and retirees; Procures and maintains an arsenal of the world's most advanced weapon systems; Improves warfighting capabilities and invests in science and technology to maintain U.S. advantage over the Nation's enemies; Maintains 545,000 facilities at 5,300 sites in the U.S. and around the globe; and Maintains vital intelligence capabilities. These funds will advance the President's priorities, maintain a robust national defense, and position the U.S. to succeed against the challenges of today and prepare for the challenges of tomorrow.

It is a resilient, committed, professional force. Continued combat over six years, however, has stretched its capabilities. Current operational tempo in the Global War on Terror provides limited recovery time for personnel and equipment. Capabilities are focused on counterinsurgency operations, while full-spectrum preparedness is the Army's goal. The Reserve Component is performing an operational role for which it was neither structured nor resourced. To maintain the all-volunteer force and its ability to respond to the full spectrum of threats, the Department is working to balance to the force. The FY 2009 President's Budget increases the Army's budget by 10 percent. In addition to the realignment of 36,000 temporary \"over strength\" personnel to the base budget, the President increased the active Army's strength by 29,000 personnel over five years. This is a combined total increase of 65,000 Soldiers, the most significant increase to Army end strength in more than three decades. This places the Army on a path to stand up 76 brigade combat teams by 2012. Raising Army end strength requires a commensurate increase in recruiting, training, base operations, family support, weapons procurement, and construction. Further, military pay and healthcare funding will increase by 12 percent from FY 2008 to FY 2009. This reflects the military pay raise of 3.4 percent. On average, an E6 will realize a $1,289 increase in basic pay in 2009. The Department places a high priority on family housing and facilities. Therefore, the FY 2009 budget increases by 15 percent over FY 2008 to upgrade and build new family Department of the Army $ in Billions Military Pay & Healthcare 42.4 46.3 51.8 +5.6 12.0% Operations, Readiness Strategic Modernization 29.5 36.3 37.1 & Facilities 5.7 10.0 11.5 Department of the Army 140.7 9.6% Military End Strength 1 FY 2007 2008 Active Component end strength includes 36,000 authorizations funded by GWOT.Numbers may not add due to roundingFY 2007 Actual FY 2008 Enacted FY 2009 RequestPercent Change '08-'09Delta '08-'09 DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 (Revision 3.0) DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY 22 housing to meet the needs of current and future Soldiers and their families and to provide facilities to accommodate the increase to Army end strength. FISCAL YEAR 2007 ACCOMPLISHMENTS Even though the Army has been engaged heavily in combat for an extended period, it has made progress on many of its objectives to increase combat capability. The Army continues its transition from a division-based force structure to a Brigade Combat Team (BCT) modular force structure. The brigade design itself has been changed, as well, making each more capable and deployable than the Army brigade of the recent past. The Army's overall transformation plan is on track to achieve a combined total of 76 modular BCTs by 2012, 48 in the Active Component and 28 in the Army National Guard. 70 BCTs have been converted or are converting through FY 2009 (Figure 2.1). The first phase of the transformation process includes training, manning, and organizing. Equipment transformation will be completed in FY 2015. By the end of FY 2007, the Active Component (AC) had built 35 of the 48 programmed BCTs to the modular design. Four brigades were converting in FY 2007; two more in FY 2008. It can take up to 12 months for Active Component heavy and infantry brigades to complete the transition and 24 months for a Stryker brigade. The Army National Guard (ARNG) began the switch to modular units in FY 2005 with an accelerated plan allowing early reorganization, manning, and training under the new BCT design. At the end of FY 2007, the ARNG was in the process of transforming 26 brigade combat teams. In FY 2008, all 28 BCTs will be converted organizationally to the modular design. They will be manned and trained by FY 2012. The Army Reserve will continue transformation of Combat Support and Combat Service Support structure to modular units to provide sustainment depth to the Army. By the end of FY 2009, 48 USAR Support Brigades will have completed conversion. In addition, the Army Reserve will rebalance the force by reducing low-demand force structure and increasing high-demand structure needed for operational requirements. In FY 2009, more than 2,000 billets within 34 units will be Figure 2.1 Brigade Combat Team Modular Conversion Summary 106-06 Source: U.S. Army, 20 Sept 2007 SAMASAt the end of FY 2007, 65 of 76 programmed BCTs reached E-Date (86%) - E-Dates only begin the process of becoming a Modular Force BCT transformation occurs within 12 months of E-Date for AC Heavy BCTs (HBCTs) and Infantry BCTs (IBCTs); 24 months for AC (SBCTs); and 48 months for all ARNG BCTs. 100% fielding of some equipment items for these units will be an on-going process well past their E-Date.

In FY 2007, the Army maintained and strengthened its warfighting readiness through a variety of training, mobility, and sustainment programs. Despite a highly dynamic period of rotational deployments, the Army continued to execute its Combined Arms Training Strategy for non-deployed units through the flying hour program and ground systems training. Both were accomplished through live exercises and simulations and have been executed at the appropriate levels, given the Army's deployment requirement s and schedule. The Army also completed a rigorous program of tough, realistic combat training at its combat training centers, including 10 Active Component brigade rotations through the National Training Center, 10 brigade rotations through the Joint Readiness Training Center, and five brigade rotations through the Joint Multi-National Readiness Center. The Battle Command Training Program conducted three Corps Warfighter exercises and trained seven division-level command and staff groups. Sustaining the all-volunteer force remains a fundamental strategic objective. The Army ended the 2007 recruiting year successfully with almost 183,000 men and women becoming Army Strong by joining units across all components. The Active Component and Army Reserve exceeded their accession objectives by achieving 100.5 percent and 100.6 percent, respectively. The Army National Guard, though only achieving 95.2 percent of its accession mission, still exceeded its end strength objective of 350,000 by 2,707 Soldiers. During 2007, the Army continued a five-year record of achieving goals for retaining Soldiers. Each component exceeded its retention goals, contributing to an aggregate rate across the Army of 109 percent (127,256 reenlistments against a goal of 116,349). The Army continues to reenlist two out of every three eligible Soldiers and one out of every two first-term Soldiers. The Army continued to improve base operations support programs worldwide with an emphasis on services, family programs, environmental programs, force protection, and audio visual and base communication services. Facility Sustainment, Restoration, and Modernization (SRM) accounts supported barracks modernization, Army Family Housing and focused facilities sustainment management. The Army also spent considerable time and resources on Soldier and family well-being efforts, which are inextricably linked to readiness. Well-being programs and family support systems were synchronized with rotation schedules and U.S Army Soldiers from Alpha Company, 2nd Battalion, 508th Parachute Infantry Regiment move into position to support Afghan National Police who are moving in to apprehend a suspect during a cordon and search of Pana, Afghanistan. U.S. Army photo by Staff Sgt. Michael L. Casteel - June 2007 DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 (Revision 3.0) DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY 24 optimized to support deployed units. Army Community Service and Reserve Component family pr ograms provided a network of integrated support services that directly affected Soldier readiness and retention, as well as spouse adaptability to military life during peacetime and through all phases of mobilization, deployment, and demobilization. The health of our all-volunteer force depends on the health of the family. Families are concerned about funding and support for family programs, physical and mental healthcare, housing, education, childcare, and employment opportunities for spouses. The Army wants to provide Soldiers and their families with a level of support commensurate with their level of service, and the Army established the Family Covenant in direct response to concerns from Army families. Army leaders around the world signed the Army Family Covenant and pledged to support Soldiers' families while they defend the nation. TRANSFORMATION STRATEGY In FY 2008, the Army implemented a plan to increase strategic depth, reestablish balance, increase capacity, and reduce the level of stress on Soldiers and units by 2012. One major element of this plan is to raise the Army's end strength by 65,000 Soldiers and to build 48 Active Component BCTs by 2012. This growth will ensure that the supply of forces is sufficient to sustain current and anticipated strategic demands. The Army also is reforming the Reserve Component (RC). The Army National Guard and U.S. Army Reserve are being utilized to fulfill operational requirements, which enables the Army to sustain its expansive and extended missions, as well as to provide support during national emergencies. In order for the RC to fill this new role, the Army is restructuring units along the modular design, improving equipment so that it matches that of the Active Component (AC), and rebalancing the resident skills and occupational specialties of the Soldiers assigned to RC units. The Army also has begun to employ a new force management tool called the Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN) model. Made possible by the greater number of brigade combat teams and their modular, interchangeable design, ARFORGEN will ensure that enough units are fully ready to fulfill Combatant Commanders' needs. Deploym ent cycles will become predictable and will include two years of home-station time out of every three for the Active Component (in the current surge environment, but with a goal of three years at home out of every four) and five years out of every six for the Reserve Component. The Army Family Covenant We recognize: The commitment and increasing sacrifices that our Families are making every day The strength of our Soldiers comes from the strength of their Families We are committed to: Providing Soldiers and Families a Quality of Life that is commensurate with their service Providing our Families a strong, supportive environment where they can thrive Building a partnership with Army Families that enhances their strength and resilience We are committed to Improving Family Readiness by: Standardizing and funding existing Family programs and services Increasing accessibility and quality of health care Improving Soldier and Family housing Ensuring excellence in schools, youth services and child care Expanding education and employment opportunities for Family membersSource: U.S. Army 106-64 DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 (Revision 3.0) DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY 25 This will ease stress on the force and provide stability to Army families, which in turn will help recruiting and retention. ARFORGEN depends upon growing the Army and fully implementing the modular force design, both of which are supported by the FY 2009 budget request. Accompanying these changes is the modernization of combat and support systems, which ensures that Soldiers retain a decisive advantage over all potential enemies. The Army is upgrading existing systems and incorporating new technologies, some developed in response to the specific needs of the unconventional battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan and some developed through the Future Combat Systems (FCS) program. Ultimately, warfighting units will undergo an evolution in capability when complete FCS brigade combat teams are fielded. FCS is the core of Army research and development (R&D). The Army's first comprehensive modernization effort in nearly four decades, FCS is designed for full-spectrum operations, from major combat to stability and support activities to defense of the homeland. FCS consists of manned and unmanned ground vehicles, sensors, launch systems, and unmanned aerial vehicles linked by a network that also connects the FCS BCT to the Global Information Grid. This ensures interoperability and secure operations not only with the Army but also with joint and coalition forces. The FCS program will release new technologies as they become available to the field through the spin-out process. FY 2009 BUDGET REQUEST The FY 2009 Defense budget includes $140.7 billion to support the Army's strategic objectives and includes adjustments necessary to support the Army Campaign Plan and Army Modernization Strategy, synchronize Grow the Army decisions with modularization of the force, and incorporate lessons learned from ongoing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Military Pay and Healthcare ($51.8 billion) The FY 2009 budget includes $51.8 billion for military pay and healthcare, an increase of $5.6 billion or 12 percent over the prior year. The FY 2009 budget continues the Grow the Army initiative. The most notable aspect of the FY 2009 Army Military Personnel account is the decision to move the requirement for 36,000 personnel previously cons idered \"over strength\" from GWOT emergency appropriation requests to the base budget. In addition to this 36,000, the Army included funding to add an additional 7,000 new Soldiers to the force in FY 2009. This is additive to the 7,000 Soldiers added in FY 2008 for a total of 50,000 additional Soldiers funded in the FY 2009 budget. These U.S. Army Command Sgt. Maj.

LaRayne Hurd, U.S. Army - December 2007 DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 (Revision 3.0) DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY 26 two initiatives will help to ensure that the right number of high- quality Soldiers with the appropriate grades and skills are available to satisfy mission needs. Operations, Readiness, and Support ($40.3 billion) The FY 2009 budget includes $40.3 billion for operations, readiness, and support, an increase of $4.4 billion or 12 percent over the prior year. Recruiting and Training Recruiting and training are integral contributors to the success of expanding the Army. The Army increased recruiting and advertising programs by 13 percent from FY 2008 to FY 2009. This funding will enable the Army to add 324 recruiters and to expand the number of recruits entering initial training by 37,968 to a total of 98,525. The Army also will add 3,270 Senior Reserve Officer Training Corps (SROTC) scholarships to help grow the officer corps. One station unit training capability, which combines Basic Combat Training and Initial Skill Training for enlisted personnel, will increase by 19,417 seats, and specialized-skill training capacity in the Active Component by nearly 95,455 seats. Flight training will expand to support the Army's transition to the CH-47F and UH-60M aircraft. To accommodate the Army's growth, Combat Training Center (CTC) capability will be increased and the focus of exercises revamped. The budget request covers various CTC improvements, such as additional Exportable Training Capability, which includes the support necessary to conduct a BCT-level exercise at home station or other remote training areas. Funding for contractor logistics to support additional training aids, devices, simulators, and simulations (TADSS) at CTCs is higher, as well, and the budget takes into account greater CTC transportation costs. A significant increase in funding to Army National Guard training reflects the mobilization policy that now requires much of the individual and collective pre-deployment training to occur while Soldiers are in pre-mobilization status. Army Reserve end strength will grow to 205,000 in FY 2009. In line with this goal, the budget funds increased recruiting and retention bonuses and incentives. Pay, benefits, and allowances U.S. Army Sgt. William Edward, from 1st Squadron, 2nd Stryker Cavalry Regiment, provides security while on a patrol in Baghdad, Iraq. U.S. Army photo by Spc. Jeffery Sandstrum - October 2007 DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 (Revision 3.0) DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY 27 for Soldiers on annual training, inactive duty training (drills) and special training status are included. The FY 2009 request also enables 50,000 Reserve Soldiers to attend training at Army schools. The FY 2009 budget expands and continues the practice of utilizing Army Reserve Soldiers and units to perform day-to-day missions during their drill periods and annual training in order to reduce the demands on the active force. Army Reserve units provide medical care and construct roads for developing countries, conduct professional development schooling for Soldiers of all components, operate communications systems for Combatant Commanders, and perform a myriad of other functions needed to sustain a worldwide defense capability Modularization The Army's ability to meet the demands of Combatant Commanders now and in the future hinges on instituting a modular force structure. The FY 2009 budget continues funding for equipment, personnel, and training for the conversions and activations of modular units, including building toward a total of six additional Brigade Combat Teams in the Active Component. The Army National Guard will continue the conversion from a division-based force to a more readily deployable brigade-centric force and, as part of the Army National Guard Rebalance initiative will convert combat brigades to multi-functional support brigades. Additionally, the Army National Guard and the Army Reserve will continue restructuring to build additional combat support and combat service support organizations. Soldier and Family Support The Army is committed to mitigating the impacts of repeated deployments; encouraging mid-grade leaders to remain in service; enhancing the quality of our support to the force; and treating Soldiers, families, and civilians with the dignity and respect they deserve. The Army recognizes the strength of our Soldiers comes from the strength of their families, and we are dedicated to building a partnership with Army families that enhances their vitality and resilience. With this in mind, the Army is increasing family programs by 85 percent in FY 2009. These programs provide a full range of services to Soldiers and families to help them respond to transitions, separations, and deployments and to alleviate the everyday stress of military life. Services include Child Development Centers, Family Readiness Group Training, Financial Readiness, Family Advocacy, the Exceptional Family Member Program, and Employment Readiness. The Army also will augment its community recreation programs, which include a variety of activities linked to Soldier readiness and retention, such as sports and fitness programs, libraries, outdoor recreation, recreation centers, arts and crafts, and automotive skills. Strategic Modernization ($37.1 billion) The FY 2009 budget includes $37.1 billion for strategic modernization, an increase of $0.8 billion or 2 percent over the prior year. The Army's top ten procurement and research and development programs total nearly half of its request for strategic modernization funds (Figure 2.2). Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&E) The Army's science and technology investment strategy is focused on enhancing the current force while pursuing long-term objectives and exploration. It has three major investment components: 1) basic research to create new understanding of technologies for future application, 2) turning applied research into militarily useful technology applications in the mid term, and 3) demonstrations of mature technology, in relevant operational environments, that can be applied to acquisition programs in the near term. The entire program is adaptable and responsive to the needs of Soldiers on the battlefield. DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 (Revision 3.0) DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY 28 A large portion of FY 2009 R&D dollars will be directed to the FCS program, including two key subsystems: the Non-Line-of-Sight Cannon (NLOS-C), which will provide sustained volume of long-range precision fires in all weather conditions; and the Non- Line-of-Sight Launch System (NLOS-LS), which will give the maneuver commander immediately responsive precision fires against high-payoff targets and instant battle damage assessment capabilities. The Army's objective is to achieve initial operating capability for one FCS brigade combat team in FY 2015 and full operating capability of that brigade by FY 2017. In FY 2011, the Army intends to field a package of FCS technologies to existing brigade combat teams. Procurement Army acquisition in FY 2009 is geared largely toward completing the equipping of modular brigade combat teams by FY 2015 and modular support brigades by FY 2019, and modernizing existing heavy brigade combat teams and aviation units. The FY 2009 budget supports procurement of 119 Stryker vehicles, including 79 Mobile Gun Systems and 40 nuclear, biological, and chemical reconnaissance vehicles. The Army also will accelerate implementation of the Warfighter Information Network-Tactical, Increment 1 in FY 2008, bringing initial operating capability to Stryker brigade combat team No. 7 between June and September 2008. As part of the modernization of heavy BCTs, the Army will reduce Abrams tank variants to two by FY 2013: the M1A2 SEP and the M1A1 AIM. In FY 2009, the Army will initiate procurement of 29 M1A2 SEP tanks, as well as Abrams Power Pack improvements, operational enhancements, field upgrades, Abrams Integrated Management (AIM) tanks, and armor. To meet the Army's Tactical Wheeled Vehicle modularity requirements and to further modernization of the medium fleet, the Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles program is funded to procure 3,187 trucks and 2,718 trailers with 2.5-ton and 5-ton capacity. The FY 2009 budget also contains money to procure 5,249 HMMWVs, including up-armored M1151A1s, M1152A1s, and M1165A1s with integrated armor. By FY 2013, the Army also will reduce the Bradley Fighting Vehicle to two variants: the M2A3 and M2A2 Operation Desert Storm (ODS). The request covers procurement of M2A3 and M2A2 ODS Enhanced Version vehicles and upgrades the Bradley's urban survivability capabilities, electrical power, and system architecture. The request also includes funding for the Family of Heavy Tactical Vehicles, such as the Palletized Load System, flat racks, the Container Handling System, the Movement Tracking System, Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Trucks, and the Heavy Equipment Transporter System.

Additionally in FY 2009, the Army will fund procurement of 88,964 M4 Carbine/Combat Optics Machine Guns, which will support BCT modularity efforts, and multiple types of night vision devices, including AN/PVS-14, ENVG, AN/PEQ-2A, thermal sights for the Long-Range Sniper Rifle, Laser Target Locating Systems, and AN/VAS-5 Driver Vision Enhancement systems. Within the missile program, the Army will continue procurement of 108 Patriots/PAC-3s and proceed with the transition from the PAC-3 to the new Missile Segment Enhancement missile. Family Housing and Facilities ($11.5 billion) The FY 2009 budget includes $11.5 billion for family housing and facilities, an increase of $1.5 billion or 15 percent over the prior year. The Army is committed to enhancing Soldier and family quality of life by improv ing housing and base facilities and providing facilities to accommodate the increase to Army end strength. The FY 2009 Military Construction and SRM programs include funding to build new and to renovate existing military facilities for both the Active and Reserve components. The focus of these efforts is upgrading living conditions and support facilities, both of which are key factors in maintaining readiness and retaining the best Soldiers and their families. The Army National Guard will concentrate on creating state-of- the-art, community-based installations and training sites that facilitate communications, operations, training, and equipment sustainment. The ARNG's program is centered around six investment areas: ranges, training facilities, maintenance support shops, readiness centers, minor construction, and planning and design. The Army Reserve construction program will improve local and regional facilities to support the training and readiness of Soldiers and units. The Army Reserve will build new reserve centers and training facilities in communities where our Soldiers and families live and work. The construction program incorporates design improvem ents, reduces environmental impacts, provides state-of-the-art secure communications, and enhances physical security. Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) The Army's BRAC budget for FY 2009 initiates 83 military construction projects plus planning and design for FY 2010 projects. It fully supports the transformation and re-stationing of the operational force, including Global Defense Posture and Realignment, as well as Reserve Component transformation in 29 states and Puerto Rico. SUMMARY The Army's FY 2009 base budget supports modularization, modernization, and end-strength growth. These three intertwined and complementary efforts are essential to the future of the Army and its ability to maintain its position as the world's dominant land force. The funding requested in the FY 2009 President's Budget is necessary to ensure that the Army is ready and able to support the President's national security objectives.

A worldwide presence, credible deterrence capability, ability to project power from naval platforms anywhere on the globe, and the ability to prevail at sea are non-negotiable elements of the U.S. Navy's strategic posture. The health of our economy, security of our people, and stability of our national interests depend on the strength of our maritime strategy. The Nation's interests are best served by fostering a peaceful global system comprised of interdependent networks of trade, finance, information, law, people, and governance. Recently, the Chief of Naval Operations and the Commandants of the U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Coast Guard announced a maritime strategy. A Cooperative Strategy for 21st Century Seapower addresses the core capabilities of security, stability, and seapower. Maritime forces remain the first line of defense, and today's naval forces must be able to deploy quickly to difficult locations. Most of the world's population lives near a coastline, and 90 percent of the world's commerce is dependent on safe waterways.

Seapower is the unifying force and common denominator that enables global security, stability, and prosperity. Preventing wars is as important as winning wars. There is a tension, however, between the requirements for continued peacetime engagement and maintaining proficiency in the critical skills necessary to fighting and winning in combat. U.S. Navy and Marine Corps forces can surge when necessary to respond to crises. Yet maritime forces must contribute to winning wars decisively while enhancing the U.S. ability to prevent war. Trust and cooperation cannot be surged; they must be built over time, with continuous attention to strategic interests which foster mutual understanding and respect among our international partners. Today the U.S. and its partners find themselves competing for global influence in an era in which they are unlikely to be fully at war or fully at peace. A range of disruptions can produce cascading and harmful effects far from their sources. Major power war, regional conflict, terrorism, lawlessness, weapons proliferation, and natural disasters all have the potential to threaten U.S. national security and world prosperity. While the enemies of yesterday were predictable, homogenous, hierarchical, and resistant to change, today's enemies are unpredictable, diverse, networked, and dynamic. These enemies do not operate on conventional battlefields. Such changes in the strategic landscape result in more competitors for the U.S. and its friends, more complex contingencies for which the Joint Force must prepare, and a broader range of mission sets for the Department of the Navy (DON). The Department's challenge is to apply seapower in a manner that protects U.S. vital interests globally even as it promotes great er collective security, stability, and trust. FISCAL YEAR 2007 ACCOMPLISHMENTS The Navy and Marine Corps team continued to answer the Nation's call, both to maintain the peace - establishing stability and security around the world - as well as fight the GWOT. The Department met its FY 2007 objectives to provide a total workforce capable and optimized to support the National Defense Strategy, to aggressively protect the peace and prosecute the GWOT, while also building the Navy and Marine Corps force for tomorrow. From combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan to humanitarian assistance and disaster relief throughout the world, the Department of the Navy has proven ready to meet any task and answer any challenge.

One surge deployment was also executed under the Navy's Fleet Response Plan. While operating in the Persian Gulf, the strike groups also conducted Maritime Security Operation (MSO) with coalition partners, operating under international maritime conventions to provide security and safety in international waters, which helped ensure the seas were free, safe, and secure for trade and commerce. In FY 2007, strike groups collectively flew over 40,000 sorties and logged over 105,000 flight hours. During the past year, Sailors and Marines continued to demonstrate their versatility and flexibility across the spectrum of the GWOT. There are over 11,300 Sailors ashore (including Individual Augmentees supporting ground forces in core mission areas and new capability areas) and 12,000 at sea in the U.S. CENTCOM region alone engaged in the GWOT. Their efforts include maritime infrastructure protection, shallow water interdiction, littoral patrol, combat engineering and construction, explosive ordnance disposal (E OD), and combat operations. Over 23,000 deployed Marines conducted combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Riverine Squadron 1, with more than 100 Sailors, deployed to the Middle East to integrate with Marines from the II Marine Expeditionary Force (II MEF) to conduct maritime security operations along rivers and other inland waterways. The deployment marked the first for a riverine squadron since the Vietnam War. The Navy and Marine Corps also participated in numerous international and joint training exercises. As a part of the Global Fleet Station (GFS) 2007 exercise, the High Speed Vessel (HSV 2) Swift was deployed to advance two objectives. First as a pilot deployment designed to analyze the GFS concept of a persistent sea base of operations from which to coordinate and employ adaptive force packages within a regional area of interest for the Navy. The second objective was to support U.S. Southern Command objectives for its area of responsibility by enhancing cooperative partnerships with regional maritime services and improving oper ational readiness for the participating partner nations. Embarked on board Swift was the task group staff and several training teams from various Navy and Coast Guard commands. Marine Corps and Department of State units also hosted information exchanges and training with the partnership countries. Humanitarian Assistance Sailors volunteered to provide assistance to help prevent flood damage to homes and businesses from Des Plaines and Skagit River flooding in Illinois and Washington, respectively. When the Interstate-35 bridge collapsed in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the Department of Transportation requested assistance from DoD in recovery efforts. The Navy answered the call by sending 17 divers and a five-person command and control element from Navy Expeditionary Combat Command. In May of 2007, Sailors of Assault Craft Unit (ACU) 5 from Camp Pendleton, California, assisted local firefighters and worked nonstop, loading and off- loading fire engines and other fire equipment. Aerial delivery of relief supplies to Nicaraguan victims of Hurricane Felix began from USS Wasp (LHD 1) on September 7, 2007, and continued from USS Samuel B. Roberts (FFG 58). The objective of delivering emergency relief supplies was to help local governments and relief organizations achieve self- sufficiency as they rebuilt from Felix's destruction.

Comfort's medical crew, Air Force and Air National Guard medical personnel, SeaBees (construction battalions), and international partners helped to treat more than 98,000 patients and renovated and completed construction projects at 27 sites throughout the region. During Pacific Partnership 2007, the crew of the USS Peleliu undertook a four-month humanitarian mission that included personnel from Navy, Army, and Air Force medical units; the U.S. Public Health Service; U.S. Navy SeaBees; and a fleet surgical team. They joined host nation medical personnel, partner nation military medical personnel, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to provide medical, dental, construction, and other humanitarian-assistance programs ashore and afloat in the Philippines, Vietnam, Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, and the Marshall Islands. Recruiting and Retention The DON focused its FY 2007 staffing efforts on three fronts: recruiting the right people, retaining the right people, and achieving targeted attrition. Resources were dedicated to those programs best suited to ensuring the proper combination of grade, skill, and experience in the force - the right person for the right job at the right time and place with the right education and the right skills. Navy Recruiting's main objectives are: To increase the quality of the Total Force by aggressively seeking qualified Sailors in 71 total occupational fields, or ratings, in both the Active and Reserve components, with emphasis on specific areas: SEALs, Navy Special Warfare (NSW), Navy Special Operations (NSO), Special Warfare Combatant-Craft Crewmen, Explosive Ordnance Disposal, Divers, Hospital Corpsmen, Reserves, and Women in Non-traditional Ratings (Master-at-Arms and SeaBees); To maintain, manage, and mentor a healthy pool of young men and women in the Delayed Entry Program (DEP) in order to smooth the flow of recruits into boot camp; and To continue providing needed support to GWOT demands by meeting the mission requirements for the other ratings that support NSW/NSO missions. The Marine Corps continued to reshape its forces to meet the growing demands of the GWOT and to provide trained forces in support of other contingencies. The Marine Corps Active Component is expected to increase to 202,000 by FY 2011 as approved by the President. The additional forces will enhance the Marine Corps' ability to maintain operations indefinitely A CH-53E Super Stallion helicopter from Marine Heavy Helicopter Squadron 465 dips its Bambi Bucket into a reservoir to help combat the wildfires burning through Southern California.

Justin L Wainscott - October 2007 DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY 35 without drastic changes to procedures, policies, organization, or operations. Additionally, the Marine Corps anticipates continued success in meeting recruiting and retention goals to maintain the planned force level. Training Training and education are critical to the continued growth and development of our Sailors and Marines and enhances their contribution to our joint warfighting ability. In FY 2007, the Navy began implementation of Spiral One Sea Warrior - a family of training, education, and career management systems. The Navy also continued to develop its language, regional expertise, and cultural programs to improve communications with adversaries, Allies, and partners. Marine Corps training and education remained stalwart components of an individual Marine's professional development. The Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) Roadmaps, in particular, continued to guide Marines through general and specific career training, education requirements, and voluntary education. Institutionally, MOS Roadmaps will increase the combat effectiveness of all Marine organizations. Additionally, Marine Corps' distributed operations in FY 2007 placed a premium on the situational awareness and judgment of junior leaders, thereby necessitating enhancements to professional development. These enhancements have been designed to empower individual Marines to assume greater responsibilities utilizing decentralized decision-making and operating in diverse cultures. Shipbuilding The future fleet of ships, as represented in the Department's 30- year shipbuilding plan, will sustain operations in forward areas longer, be able to respond more quickly to emerging contingencies, and generate more sorties and simultaneous attacks against greater numbers of multiple targets and with greater effect than our current fleet. The DON continued to see the future fleet take shape with ongoing ship construction programs including the following: Dry Cargo and Ammunition Ship (T-AKE); Guided-Missile Destroyers (DDG); Nuclear-Powered Attack Submarine (SSN); Landing - Replacement (LHA(R)); Carrier Replacement Program (CVN 77); Landing Platform Dock Ship (LPD 17); Littoral Combat Ship (LCS); and Amphibious Assault Ship (LHD 1).

Jeremy Lock - June 2007 DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY 36 Aviation Procurement The DON is in the midst of an extensive, long-term consolidation and recapitalization of naval aircraft to develop the optimum balance between requirements and usage. To sustain global air superiority, in FY 2007 the DON invested in several naval aviation acquisition programs and procured 157 aircraft STRATEGY The Department of the Navy transformation strategy focuses on prevailing in the Global War on Terror, strengthening joint warfighting capabilities, meeting the needs of the men and women who make up the Navy and Marine Corps, and transforming enterprise management. Major initiatives in support of transformation are: Prevail in Global War on Terror Swiftly improve high value target tracking and locating capabilities. The DON budget for FY 2009 supports efforts to develop an enhanced capability to identify threats within the Maritime Domain as early and as distant from our shores as possible, by integrating intelligence, observation, and navigation systems into a common operating picture accessible throughout the USG. The Maritime Domain Awareness initiative will combine the efforts of Federal, state, and local governmental agencies, international governments, non-governmental organizations, and commercial and private enterprises to create an understanding of anything associated with the global maritime domain that could impact the security, safety, economy, or environment of the U.S. Strengthen Joint Warfighting Capabilities Sustain Special Operations Forces expansion plan. In FY 2007, the DON took additional steps to enhance recruiting efforts for Naval Special Warfare/Naval Special Operations (NSW/NSO). The unique skill sets in the NSW/NSO communities demand intensive training of exceptionally bright, physi cally fit and mentally tough individuals. Significant investments in training these operators have been made and the Navy must utilize every available incentive tool to retain them and capitalize on that investment. The Marine Corps Special Operations U.S. Naval sea cadets execute pushups at the coastline of Little Creek Amphibious Base, VA, during explosive ordnance disposal (EOD)/diving training. The EOD/diving training is a three-week long course that not only educates sea cadets about the naval special warf are community, but also emphasizes teamwork along with individual accomplishments in the team environment. U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Katherine Boeder DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY 37 Command (MARSOC), established in 2006, is a complimentary force that will ease the strain on the elite units of other Services and contribute to the Nation's readiness in the GWOT. Within the next two years, MARSOC will grow to an end strength of 2,600, including 24 foreign military training units that will deploy worldwide in support of U.S. Special Operations Command and the various combatant commanders. Strengthen cultural awareness and language capabilities. DON continues to focus significant effort on transforming and enhancing its expertise in foreign language, regional expertise, and cultural awareness. Navy implemented a Language, Regional Expertise, and Culture (LREC) strategy that galvanizes and aligns related efforts across the Navy Total Force. The workforce was surveyed for existing language proficiency, bonuses were increased for language competencies, heritage recruiting became a focused effort, a new Foreign Area Officer (FAO) community was established, and training and education programs in regional issues were implemented. To systematically capture foreign language proficiency in the future, Navy began mandatory foreign language screening at military accession points and expanded eligibility requirements for the Foreign Language Proficiency Bonus. Grow the Force . Today's Marine Corps shoulders a critical part of the GWOT with over 32,000 Marines forward deployed. Fighting across the spectrum of conflicts, the USMC's ability to sustain deployed forces for extended periods supports COCOMs prosecuting the war throughout the world. To posture forces for the GWOT and support the Marine Corps' aggressive deployment tempo, the Marine Corps is in the process of increasing its active duty end strength to 202,000 Marines no later than FY 2011. This additional end strength will provide a balanced operating force that will be large enough to sust ain a 1:2 deployment-to-dwell ratio. Achieving this operating tempo ensures that Marines have the time to train for the full range of military operations as well as continuing the nation's fight against global terrorism. The Marine Corps continues to emphasize priorities that ensure success of the Grow the Force initiative, including increases in recruiting and personnel retention incentives, adjustments and increases in force structure and facilities, and transformational shifts in training support. Accordingly, the DON budget supports a considerable increase in end strength funding. Focus on People Provide a total workforce capable and optimized to support the National Defense Strategy. The DON continues to focus on sizing, shaping, and stabilizing the total force to apply the right skill sets to projected requirements in the most cost efficient manner. Development and retention of quality people are vital to continued success. America's naval forces are combat-ready largely due to the dedication and motivation of individual Sailors, Marines, and civilians. The FY 2009 budget reflects leadership priorities to support quality of life improvements for Service members and families. Transform Enterprise Management Continue Navy Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Implementation. Navy ERP will integrate and improve Navy processes for logistics, acquisition, and financial operations. The first major command to implement an ERP system was the Naval Air Systems Command on October 1, 2007. The program is a cornerstone of the DON's business transformation strategy and a key enabler to transform business processes, which will increase productivity and generate efficiencies. DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY 38 Adopt Lean Six Sigma Methodology. Lean Six Sigma (LSS) has been implemented throughout the DON to create dollar and readiness assets in service, support and transaction processes. The DON's major commands have launched Lean Six Sigma training programs and are applying LSS concepts, techniques, and tools to various segments of business operations, which should result in process efficiencies. BUDGET REQUEST The FY 2009 budget fully supports the Department's maritime strategy, as well as the recently published \"Department of the Navy Objectives for FY 2008 and Beyond.\" The strategy objectives also support the strategic guidance established by the Secretary of Defense and focus on key efforts that will increase the effectiveness of the entire Department. Working from the FY 2008 President's Budget, the DON has built on the foundation of three sets of guidance in constructing FY 2009 budget submissions. The 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review, the Strategic Planning Guidance, and the GWOT Campaign Plan delineated many consistent and clear requirements for the Joint Force. The FY 2009 budget balances capabilities to support traditional and irregular warfare demands while transforming a blue water Navy into one that can fight and win in the blue, green, and brown waters, and expanding the lethality of the Marine Corps. The FY 2009 budget will enable the Navy to: Provide a total Navy workforce - Recruit, retain, and train personnel to provide the workforce needed for the 21st century; Aggressively prosecute any military contingency, such as the GWOT - Provide a persistent forward presence for proactive shaping, disrupting, and attacking terror networks and for readiness to conduct conventional campaigns; Build the force for tomorrow - Procure a fleet that is capabilities based, threat oriented, and ready to defeat any potential adversary; Safeguard people and resources - Integrate safety and risk management into all on and off-duty evolutions; Strengthen ethics as a foundation of exemplary conduct - Reinforce core values as a framework for making decisions and; Provide first-rate facilities for our personnel - Support Quality of Life programs and align shore infrastructure to provide effective support to the fleet. America's Marines remain fully engaged in the fight for freedom around the globe. The FY 2009 budget submission will support those at war today, while ensuring Marines are ready to serve U.S. Navy photo by Seaman Andrew Brantley - November 2007U.S. Navy Petty Officer 3rd Class Chri stopher Coulson, a fire controlman, watches the fire control radar used to track and follow enemy aircraft in the combat information center on board the amphibious assault ship USS Essex. DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY 39 the Nation tomorrow. To meet these responsibilities, the Marine Corps must simultaneously train, maintain, reconstitute, and modernize its force, and the Commandant has charged Marines at every level to focus the resources available, including time and effort, on accomplishing a number of important objectives: Achieve victory in GWOT; Grow the Force; Provide the Nation a naval force that is fully prepared for employment across the spectrum of conflict; and Reset and modernize to be ready when the Nation is least ready. The Department of the Navy's FY 2009 budget supports a forward posture and readiness for agile response. It positions the DON to play an integral role in global maritime security and humanitarian efforts, alongside other Federal and international agencies. The Department continuously trains for humanitarian assistance missions in order to respond rapidly and efficiently to large-scale disasters and to reduce loss of life and human suffering. FY 2009 BUDGET HIGHLIGHTS FY 2009 funding priorities are balanced to support the right Navy and Marine Corps team for the future Joint Force. Provide a Total Naval Workforce Navy Strength Manpower adjustments were made to further align the DON's Total Force to mission objectives. Navy manpower is increased for the new Naval Expeditionary Combat Command (NECC) to meet growing GWOT requirements. This increase was more than offset by a decrease in active manpower based on force structure reductions and civilian and/or contract labor. Marine Strength The FY 2009 submission fully supports the President's Grow the Force initiative. The Marines will grow by 27,000 and transition to an active duty end strength of 202,000 no later than FY 2011. The Marine Corps has rebalanced the baseline program to shift resources from conventional to irregular capabilities and capacities. As part of the President's plan, the Marine Corps will grow to sustain three balanced Marine Expeditionary Forces (MEFs). This growth will occur in stages. In FY 2009, the Marine Corps will add over twenty types of combat, combat support, and combat service support units. Civilian Personnel Civilians are an integral part of the DON's total workforce, consisting of military, civilian, and contractor personnel who support the mission and functions of the Navy and Marine Corps. To support the Total Force view, competency-based management is being introduced to align critical skills and capabilities across all segments of the workforce. Authorized in the FY 2004 National Defense Authorization Act, the National Security Personnel System provides flexibility in hiring and managing civilian workers and links pay and performance to the mission and accomplishment of organizational goals. Aggressively Prosecute Any Military Contingency, including the GWOT Readiness The DON budget reflects a commitment to properly price and fund readiness to meet the demands of the COCOMs in the near term. Funding the Fleet Response Plan (FRP) to 6+1 meets essential COCOM readiness and surge requirements. Additionally, the budget funds 45 deployed steaming days per quarter and 22 non-deployed days per quarter in FY 2009, which DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY 40 sustains FY 2008 budgeted steaming levels and is sufficient to meet baseline readiness needs while fully supporting contingency operations, including the GWOT. Build the Force for Tomorrow Maritime Domain Awareness Support is increased for the Navy's efforts to develop an enhanced capability to identify threats within the Maritime Domain as early and as distant from U.S. shores as possible by integrating intelligence, observation, and navigation systems into a common operating picture accessible throughout the USG. Shipbuilding The next generation of aircraft carrier, the Ford Class or CVN- 21, will be the future centerpiece of the carrier strike group and a major contributor to the future Expeditionary Strike Group. CVN- 21 has a major role in Sea Shield, projecting Navy combat power anywhere in the world. The DDG 1000 program, formerly the DD(X) program, is the next generation of multi-mission surface combatants tailored for land attack and littoral dominance, with capabilities designed to defeat current and projected threats. The FY 2009 budget provides funding for DDG 1002, the third ship of the class, and advance procurement funding for DDG 1003. The Navy continues the effort to modernize the fleet of SSN, SSGN, and SSBN submarines. Virginia Class fast attack submarines have joined the existing fleet of SSN-688 and Seawolf Class ships to project power covertly throughout the world's oceans. The FY 2009 budget accelerates achievement of an annual procurement rate of two Virginia Class SSN hulls to FY 2011 from FY 2012. Aviation Navy and Marine Corps aviation continues to be at the forefront of the Nation's defense. The FY 2009 budget supports the best balance of naval aviation requirements. The Department continues to decrease the average age of the aircraft inventory to 17 years in FY 2009, from a high of above 20 years in the 1990s and 18 years in 2006. Based on the current Future Years Defense Program (FYDP) procurement plan, the average age will approach 14 years by 2013. Multi-year procurement contracts for F/A-18E/F, EA-18G, MH- 60R/S, MV-22B, and KC-130J have enabled the Department to realize significant savings. Development funding continues for the P-8A and CH-53K. The FY 2009 budget includes Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) for three E-2D aircraft and eight F-35 Short Take Off and Vertical Landing (STOVL) variants.

Chase - February 2007 DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY 41 Weapons Continued investments in advanced technology ensure conventional warfare advantage for the U.S. Examples include the Navy's investment in the SM-6 standard missile and its associated Naval Integrated Fire Control - Counter Air (NIFC- CA) capabilities, the next-generation maritime surveillance aircraft, and weapons to attack moving targets (dual-mode Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) and Hellfire). The DON took calculated risk in funding solutions for these challenges. Provide First-Rate Facilities The FY 2009 budget request achieves the DON's key goals, financing 106 military construction projects for the active Navy and Marine Corps and five military construction projects for the Navy and Marine Corps Reserves. To support the Grow the Force initiative and the Marine Corps growth in end strength over the next five years, additional military construction to accommodate, train, and house these personnel and their families is required. The DON has concluded detailed facilities planning that has restructured and refined the military construction baseline and provides an executable profile to support and sustain three balanced Marine Expeditionary Forces. The budget also continues to fully support the Marine Corps' initiative to achieve 2+0 Quality of Life standard room design by FY 2012. SUMMARY Support of the Department of the Navy FY 2009 budget is critical if the Navy and Marine Corps are to achieve their missions to support the DON transformation strategy. This budget delivers a proposal that rebalances, recapitalizes, and sustains the force; stabilizes the long range shipbuilding plan; and continues to pursue aviation sustainment, recapitalization, and modernization in anticipation of a new long range aviation procurement plan. The FY 2009 budget seeks a balance between the traditional, the irregular, and the transformational, while recapitalizing and building the force. Readiness is properly priced and funded to meet the demands of COCOMs. Warfighting capability investments support all national military strategy goals, while procuring a 313-ship Navy and its associated capabilities. The DON is funded to procure 47 ships and 1,102 airplanes during the FYDP. It supports the right-sized force, trained and ready for tasking in any waterway of the world to meet both traditional and irregular threats. U.S. Navy Petty Officer 2nd Class Summer M.

To maintain these capabilities, the FY 2009 budget increases the Air Force's funding by 7 percent. Nonetheless, the challenges of 17 years of contingency operations have weighed heavily on the Air Force - Operations Desert Shield, Desert Storm, Northern Watch and Southern Watch, Operation Noble Anvil, Operations Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom, and Operation Noble Eagle. For the Air Force, manning for Iraqi deployments began in 1990, and there have been no breaks in the high operations tempo (OPTEMPO) since then. It has been 17 years of continuous combat in which the Air Force delivered decisive military power on a global scale. While accomplishing today's mission, Air Force leaders are concerned about the pace of modernization and recapitalization in light of emerging threats across the spectrum of air, space, and cyberspace. Winning today's fight, taking care of our people, and preparing for tomorrow's challenges are the Air Force's highest priorities. The FY 2009 President's Budget supports these priorities, ensuring the Air Force's ability to support Combatant Commanders worldwide and to operate effectively in the joint warfighting environment today and the uncertain environment of the future. FISCAL YEAR 2007 ACCOMPLISHMENTS The mission of the U.S. Air Force is to deliver sovereign options for the defense of the U.S. and its global interests\u2014to fly and fight in air, space, and cyberspace. Sovereign options refers to the spectrum of choices that the Air Force's air, space, and cyberspace capabilities offer U.S. policy makers for determining Department of the Air Force $ in Billions Military Pay & Healthcare 30.2 30.8 31.9 +1.1 3.5% Operations, Readiness & 55.8 58.9 63.3 & Facilities 3.7 3.8 3.2 -0.6 -15.7% Total Department of the Air Force 128.3 134.3 143.9 +9.6 7.1% Military End Strength 2008 Projected FY may not Change '08-'09Delta '08-'09FY 2007 Actual FY 2008 Enacted FY 2009 Request DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE 44 when, how, and where to engage an enemy. In peacetime, these options include activities that compel positive behavior through means short of war, by moving forces into contested regions as a show of commitment, and providing humanitarian aid. In wartime, Air Force capabilities provide a range of options including actions in conjunction with Allied ground forces, or direct attacks and strikes against enemy centers of gravity to accomplish strategic outcomes. These options provide the nation with credible and scalable options to counter potential enemy actions and increase U.S. influence. The Air Force accomplishes this mission in a very challenging and dynamic environment while ensuring that the Nation's most critical warfighting needs are met. FY 2007 marked another year of fighting a war and supporting humanitarian needs at home and abroad. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan continue to stress our equipment and people. Most sorties in OIF and OEF are flown by the Air Force, and during FY 2007, the Air Force: Flew over 80,000 sorties; Carried out an average of 300 sorties each day, including close air support, strike, inter- and intra-theater airlift, refueling, aero-medical evacuation, and Command, Control, Communications, Computer, Intelligence Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR); and Conducted more than 900 air strikes, employing more than 2,600 air-to-ground weapons. These operations are supported by more than 25,000 Airmen who are deployed in support of the Central Command area of responsibility. In OIF alone, the Air Force delivers the equivalent of 3,500 trucks worth of cargo per month. As a result, more than 8,600 people do not have to traverse dangerous roads to transport cargo, allowing the Army and Marines to retask those vehicles and associated troops to other missions. The focus of this airlift is to provide the capability to deploy the Nation's armed forces anywhere in the world and help to sustain them in a conflict. The Air Force also prov ides vital lift assets to keep the homeland secure and to respond to crises at home. In the fall of 2007, Air Force Reserve C-130s supported civil and military forces engaged in battling wildfires in southern California. In FY 2007, the Air Force's airlift mission delivered maximum warfighting and humanitarian relief through rapid and precise delivery of global air mobility, including humanitarian support at home and around the world. Additionally, air refueling capability provides the lifeline of Global Reach - the capability to move people and equipment across the world quickly, ensuring the right force - increasing range, payloads, and flexibility. Increasingly, U.S. Allies rely upon America's airlift capabilities around the world. In FY 2007, Air Force members supported the Rwandan military by moving United Nations A C-130 Hercules combat drops cargo during an exercise. The Hercules primarily performs the intratheater portion of the airlift mission. The aircraft is capable of operating from rough, dirt st rips and is the prime transport for paradropping troops and equipment into hostile areas. Four decades have elapsed since the Air Force issued its original design specification, yet the remarkable C-130 remains in production.

In an effort to address emerging missions, the Air Force established a Cyberspace Task Force and stood up a provisional Air Force Cyberspace Command. Cyberspace dominance goes beyond communications and Information Technology (IT). It requires superiority across the entire electromagnetic spectrum, which includes radio waves, microwaves, infrared, x-rays, directed energy, and applications the Air Force has yet to discover and exploit. The primary mission of this new command is to integrate global kinetic and non-kinetic strike capability and to organize, train, and equip to ensure the full spectrum of integrated global effects. The Command will be responsible for integrating cyber and physical weapons on targets. This new command stands alongside Air Force Space Command, Air Mobility Command, and Air Combat Command as the provider of forces for preserving the freedom of access and commerce in air, space, and cyberspace. Full Operational Capability of this command is projected for October 2009. The mission of the Air Force necessitates quality people performing at optimal levels. Recruiting and retaining the right people and skill sets is key to ensuring the Air Force workforce will be available to execute today's missions, while preparing for tomorrow's. In FY 2007, the Air Force met its overall recruiting goals and focused on filling needs in career fields with shortfalls such as para-rescue, linguists, and security forces. Bonuses and incentives are one tool to attract this talent. These investments save time as well as money recruiting and training for new personnel. Congressional support for these programs - along with increases in pay, benefits, and quality of life initiatives - has kept recruiting on target to meet goals and allowed retention of the right people in these career fields. While recruiting talent and maintaining the correct force balance, the Air Force must also meet reduced end strength levels.

U.S. Air Force photo by Senior Airman Christina D. Ponte - July 2007 DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE 46 the past few years, the Air Force has been working to balance and reduce its end strength to authorized levels. From FY 2004 through FY 2009, the Air Force is decreasing its end strength by about 60,000. The goal is to get to approximately 316,600 active duty personnel by the end of FY 2009. To meet this goal, the Air Force is offering voluntary separation pay to officers in overage career fields, and a Selective Early Retirement Board will convene to identify retirement-eligible officers for early retirement if necessary. Achieving these reductions will be difficult, and the new end strength levels will demand transformation of many practices, policies, and behaviors. The high tempo of military oper ations\u2014and the demand placed on people and resources\u2014has led the Air Force to turn more and more to its Reserve and National Guard partners to balance the force. Recognizing that this relia nce will continue to be a feature of Air Force operations and that the partnership has led to enhanced capability across the Total Force, the Air Force has embraced the Total Force Integration (TFI). Expanding the Reserve associate unit program, where reservists operate and maintain equipment with their active duty counterparts and which has been traditionally successful in the mobility arena, to include the National Guard and a variety of weapons systems is one of the key initiatives. The Air Force has established associate units at multiple locations for a variety of aircraft. These include F-22s in Virginia and Alaska, C-17s in Hawaii, F-16s in Utah, and C- 130s in Wyoming. Also, Guardsmen are analyzing GWOT intelligence in Kansas, and Reservists are flying operational GWOT unmanned aerial system missions from Nevada. TRANSFORMATION STRATEGY Transformation across the Air Force includes changes in operational concepts, organization, and/or technologies that significantly improve warfighting capabilities or ability to meet the demands of a changing security environment. The Air Force continues to implement the Air Force Smart Operations for the 21st century (AFSO21) initiative. Led by the Secretary of the Air Force, this initiative focuses on new ways of meeting warfighter requirements to generate efficiencies and improve combat capabilities across the Air Force. Proven efficiency processes like Lean and Six Sigma, theory of constraints, and business process reengineering principles, govern the initiative. The ultimate goal is to establish an environment where various tools and techniques are employed to change the Air Force's day-to-day operating style and fully integrate continuous improvement into the full spectrum of Air Force operations. Another transformational initiative, introduced in the last section, that has been undertaken to change operational concepts is TFI, which was discussed in the last section and combines the current Air Force Strategic Plan goal to \"improve the total force quality of life\" and the 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) Air Force officials are looking at proposals for a new strategic refueling aircraft, referred to as the KC-X, to replace the aging KC-135 Stratotanker. U.S. Air Force Photo DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE 47 recommendations for \"Developing a 21st Century Total Force.\" Today's senior leaders believe \"the Total Force is one force\" including Regular Component, Air Force Reserve, Air National Guard, Air Force civilians, and contractors. In a reconfigured Total Force, there must be expanded opportunities to integrate personnel from all Total Force components. These efforts enable the Air Force to meet the challenges of a shrinking budget, an aging aircraft inventory, and emerging missions and to capitalize on the inherent strengths of the Air Force, ensuring partnership among elements of the Total Force in virtually every facet of Air Force operations. The current Air Force Strategic Plan also calls for retirement of legacy aircraft to ensure the right force mix while investing in technologically superior systems. The air and space inventory that the U.S. relies on today is largely what Congress appropriated 20 or 25 years ago. The aging inventory must be recapitalized and modernized to prepare for an uncertain, complex, and threatening future. This effort includes retiring old and obsolete aircraft and replacing them with fewer numbers of more capable systems. The Air Force's top five procurement priorities are a step in that direction and are: the Tanker program, Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR-X) program, Space programs including TSAT and SBIRS, the Joint Strike Fighter (F-35), and the New Bomber (Figure 2.3, p. 51). The QDR's vision for joint air capabilities includes systems with greater range and persistence, larger and more flexible payloads, the ability to penetrate and operate in denied areas, and the ability to destroy moving targets in all weather conditions. To achieve this, the Air Force is making changes in the strategic bomber fleet. The resources made available by these changes will go toward modernizing the remaining B-52 fleet, along with B-1s and B-2s. Procuring new aircraft and space systems on schedule and at reduced cost requires transformation of the Air Force's acquisition processes. A number of projects have contributed to the improvement of acquisition, and FY 2009 promises more progress. For example, the Air Force is working to establish and enforce standards for transparency in acquisition and other business processes that are commensurate with \"best-in-class\" public and private sector organizations. Financial transparency is essential to good governance, and good governance is vital to ensure that the Air Force can produce and field systems to fly and fight. The Air Force will continue to perfect the processes that promote good governance through transparency and accurate, reliable, and timely life cycle financial data throughout the Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution (PPBE) process. The Air Force has revitalized its Acquisition Strategy Panel, providing a systematic and disciplined approach to acquisitions. The Air Force Review Board process provides a structured, repeatable system that aids decision making on critical aspects of selected acquisition programs. The periodic review processes have been streamlined by combining several independent reviews into a single event, saving both preparation and travel time. IT modernization efforts are moving forward rapidly, and the Air Force should reach its targets for 2012, ahead of schedule. AFSO21 IT initiatives - such as server and help desk consolidation, standard desktop configuration, and the adoption of industry best practices - will drive down total cost of ownership (TCO). The standard desktop configuration alone will bring TCO down by over $140 million. These and other initiatives will yield nearly $120 million in savings over the next two years, while only requiring a $7 million investment. The Air Force's goal over the next six years is to go from a Service-wide total of 1,700 separate systems and 19,000 applications to 700 systems and 10,000 applications. The eventual goal is to have fewer than 100 systems and 1,000 applications. Air Force logistics is leading this wave of transformation with its Expeditionary Combat Support System (ECSS) enterprise DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE 48 resource planning suite. ECSS will merge base-level and wholesale logistics systems, and integrate a number of logistics business functions. This will result in the migration from over 400 systems to fewer than 10 by 2012. FUNDING PRIORITIES The Air Force's funding priorities support the Department's priorities: winning today's war, taking care of our people, and preparing for tomorrow's challenges. The Air Force budget was developed on four funding \"pillars\"\u2014people, readiness, infrastructure, and modernization. These four \"pillars\" provide the funding for the Air Force's overarching capabilities\u2014Global Vigilance, Global Reach, and Global Power. Economic realities such as rising personnel costs and the increasing cost of fleet operations (Depot Programmed Equipment Maintenance, Contractor Logistics Support, and Flying Hour Program) underscore the need to recapitalize. Operating costs have increased ste adily over the last 10 years and investment funding for modernization of the Air Force as a percent of Total Obligation Authority has declined over the past 22 years. Together with a high OPTEMPO and a smaller, older fleet, these developments have resulted in declining readiness since 2001. People Despite these economic realities, taking care of people is still a priority for the Air Force. However, maintaining this priority comes with a price. The Air Force will continue to fund increases in base pay, cost of living allowances, basic allowances for housing and subsistence, retirement pay accruals, and taxes. These items are required to maintain the force at the standard of living that will attract and retain Airmen. Additionally, the Air Force will continue to fund retention initiatives to keep quality Airmen on active duty. For example, major programs include initial enlistment/selective reenlistment bonuses, aviator continuation pay, professional special pays, foreign language proficiency pay, and programs to increase regional affairs and political-military affairs strategists.

U.S. Air Force photo by Senior Airman Christina D. Ponte - August 2007 DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE 49 Readiness Air Force readiness requires adequate flying hours for training aircrews, maintaining a fleet of over 5,600 aircraft, and funding 84 major installations and 1,200 pilots. It also includes support and training programs to develop Airmen for the expeditionary environment and to keep them prepared to deploy when and where they are needed. The Air Force must also conduct space control and satellite operations for over 140 Department and national satellites and operate two space lift ranges, while providing global, seamless command and control and interoperable communications. Infrastructure Infrastructure continues to support the Air Force's top three priorities. While infrastructure is a foundation for all facets of mission accomplishment, the Air Force is accepting risk in this area to free up funds for transformation and weapons modernization, both of which must be balanced against rising business operations costs (e.g., rising utility and manpower costs). This does not mean that this area is being neglected. The FY 2009 request funds 49 construction projects worldwide, including mission beddowns for F-35, F-22, and C-17, improved joint training and repair facilities, six Quality of Life projects, and five in support of CENTCOM operations. The FY 2009 budget sustains an infrastructure plant worth more than $240 billion. Funding for military family housing remains focused on revitalizing overseas housing and completing the initiative to revitalize housing here at home; as privatization continues, costs for Basic Allowance for Housing increase (discussed in the People Section) while military family housing costs decline. Finally, the FY 2009 program continues construction activities in support of recommendations of the 2005 BRAC Commission and the Air Force commitment to meet BRAC closure deadlines of September 2011. Modernization The final key to success is the Air Force's modernization effort. The Air Force continues to become more capable, more efficient, and more lethal. Modernization includes aggressive divestment of legacy platforms, significant investments in new platforms with increased capabilities and reliability, and a focus on maintaining a responsive modern individual base. Meanwhile, the average age of inventory continues to increase. The average age of aircraft is now 24 years and the aircraft recapitalization rate is approaching 50 years. FY 2009 BUDGET REQUEST Formulating a budget today requires an appreciation for the impact financial decisions have on the Air Force's ability to respond to multiple threats around the globe with a wide range of capabilities. The current Air Force Strategic Plan states that \"persistent, lethal, overwhelming Air, Space, and Cyberspace power massed and brought to bear anywhere, anytime\" is the common foundation for the Air Force today and in the future. To ensure that this foundation is sustained as effectively and efficiently as possible, it is important that the Air Force know the impact of budget decisions. The Air Force will continue to refine its methods for understanding how performance affects priorities. The Strategic Plan addresses new responsibilities for aligning performance measures with Air Force priorities, goals, and objectives. The Air Force has established \"Priority Champions\" and \"Objective Champions\" aligned to each priority, goal, and objective. This new process for looking at performance measures will demand additional accountability for meeting strategic goals at the Secretary of the Air Force and Chief of Staff of the Air Force level and in an \"enterprise-wide\" manner. Continuing to refine measures and metrics will be a major step toward ensuring that strategic priorities are achieved. DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE 50 To ensure the ability to fulfill roles and missions and dominate air, space, and cyberspace, the Air Force has embarked on the biggest and most important recapitalization and modernization effort in its history. The dynamic nature of the world's geopolitical climate and the increasing pressures of an extended warfighting posture require continual analysis and adjustments to the Air Force budget. Summarized below are highlights of the FY 2009 budget request organized around the four pillars. People The FY 2009 budget request includes a 3.4 percent across-the- board pay raise for officer and enlisted personnel, a 4.9 percent increase for Basic Allowance for Housing, and an increase to Permanent Change of Station (PCS) funding. The change in PCS is to support full value replacement of household goods and increases the amount allowed for moving household goods as part of the Department's Families' First program. These funding increases are offset by decreases in officer and enlisted end strength. Readiness The FY 2009 request includes increases for aviation fuel, inflation, utilities costs, and aircraft depot maintenance and contract logistics support. Targeted increases in key readiness areas such as realistic live fire combat training, individual combat skills, and intelligences application are also funded. These increases are offset by decreases in flying hour training due to planned OPTEMPO demands, increased usage of flight simulators, and reduced operational costs due to the retirement of the F-117. Infrastructure The FY 2009 budget includes increases for Facility Sustainment at 90 percent of the requirement, the Pentagon Reservation Maintenance Fund, and Base maintenance contracts. Military construction project funding is nearly at the FY 2008 President's Budget requested levels. Modernization The FY 2009 budget request for RDT&E and procurement continues emphasis on the Air Force's top five programs (Figure 2.3). The budget also procures 20 F-22 Raptors, six MC/HC-130s, six CV-22s, 38 Predators, nine Reapers, five Global Hawks and four Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicles, munitions, legacy modifications and classified programs. MAJOR PROGRAMS The key to providing transformational warfighting capability is the development of superior programs. The Air Force's top five priorities are the Tanker program, Combat Search and Rescue Helicopter (CSAR-X) program, Space Programs (TSAT and SBIRS), the F-35, and the New Bomber (Figure 2.3).

DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE 51 Tanker Recapitalization : Aerial refueling capability is essential to the expeditionary nature of the U.S. armed forces. Aerial refueling serves as a force multiplier and provides U.S. and Coalition air forces with increased range, persistence, and duration. For the past 50 years, the Air Force's primary tanker platform has been the KC-135, and it has served with distinction. Yet, given the increased OPTEMPO and the requirements of the GWOT, procurement of a new tanker aircraft has become both an operational necessity and the most fiscally prudent option for the future. The new tanker will provide increased availability, more adaptable technology, and greater capability. Enhance- ments in every aspect of aircraft operation will help to provide the Joint warfighter with more flexible employment options. Combat Search and Rescue Helicopter (CSAR-X): The Air Force must recapitalize the CSAR forces to recover isolated Joint or Coalition personnel engaged across the spectrum of military operations, as well as to support non-combatant evacuation and disaster relief operations. The CSAR-X will relieve the high OPTEMPO strain placed on the current \"low-density/high-demand\" (LD/HD) inventory of HH-60G Pave Hawk helicopters. The CSAR-X dramatically improves mission reaction time, range, cabin space, survivability, battlespace awareness, and ability to conduct adverse weather and high-altitude hover operations. The CSAR-X will provide personnel recovery forces with an aircraft that is quickly deployable and capable of main base and austere location operations for worldwide recovery missions. It will operate day or night, during adverse weather conditions, and in all environments, including nuclear, biological, and chemical conditions. Onboard defensive capabilities will permit the CSAR-X to operate in an increased-threat environment, and in-flight refueling will provide an airborne alert capability and extend its combat mission range. Space Programs : The Air Force continues to strengthen its core competency in space through the robust enhancements in each of the space mission areas: Communication; Missile Warning; Position, Navigation, and Timing; and Space Situational Awareness. Providing a robust missile warning capability to the nation through enhanced space-based intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) systems remains a priority in the FY 2009 budget. Development of SBIRS continues with hardware and software integration, which will lead to a planned launch of the SBIRS Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO)-1 satellite in late 2009. Once fielded, SBIRS will provide a transformational leap in capability over the aging Defense Support Program system. Additionally, the Air Force continues to pursue next-generation satellite communications technology with the TSAT. The TSAT program will employ Internet Protocol (IP) networks, onboard routing, and high bandwidth laser communication relays in space, dramatically increasing warfighter communications connectivity. TSAT capabilities will enable the realization and success of the Department and Joint visions of future network-centric operations of the Air Force, Army, and Navy. F-35 Lightning II : The F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) multi-role aircraft is optimized for air-to-ground attack. The F-35 Conventional Take-off and Landing (CTOL) variant will recapitalize combat capabilities currently provided by the F-16 and A-10 and will complement the capabilities of the F-22. The F-35 will specifically provide affordable precision engagement Figure 2.3 Air Force's Strategic Modernization Programs (selected) 106-67 Numbers may not add due to rounding Source: United States Air Force - Includes RDT&E and Procurement0.8 Transformational Satellite Comm.

The F-35 will be four times more effective than legacy fighters in air-to-air engagements, eight times more effective in prosecuting missions against fixed and mobile targets, and three times more effective in non-traditional ISR and Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses and Destruction of Enemy Air Defense (SEAD/DEAD) missions. It will support all of these capabilities at about the same procurement cost as legacy fighters but will require significantly less infrastructure and a smaller basing footprint. New Bomber : Long Range Strike continues as a vital and unique Air Force contribution to national defense. The Air Force has a three-phased strategy to help ensure the U.S. meets its enduring Long Range Strike capability requirements. Phase One includes near-term maintenance and modernization of current bombers and air-to surface weapons. Phase Two will deliver, by 2018, a new manned bomber that has state-of-the-art technologies. This system will combine speed, stealth, payload, and improved avionics/sensors suit es to be effective across the full range of military operations in meeting Combatant Commanders' global needs. In Phase Three, the Air Force plans to field a revolutionary Long Range Strike capability in the 2035 time frame using an advanced sy stem-of-systems approach. By then, technology maturation could include advancements such as hypersonic propulsion and non-kinetic weapons. SUMMARY The warfighting capability of the nation depends on adequate funding to achieve Air Force goals and priorities. If the Air Force does not receive the funds requested in the FY 2009 budget request, current readiness will degrade and modernization and recapitalization priorities will be delayed. This significantly increases risk to the air, space and cyberspace missions the U.S. likely needs to fight future wars. Delaying modernization and recapitalization efforts will also mean increased costs for both current and future programs. The Air Force is meeting its commitments today. But along with the stresses of the continued GWOT, emerging threats are a concern. The challenges to air and space dominance include proliferation of integrated air defenses, growth of fourth generation combat aircraft worldwide, proliferation of low- observable and cruise missiles, and threats to our current ability to leverage space and cyberspace. Recapitalization is an urgent national security need. The fiscal challenges of aging aircraft, aging facilities, increased personnel costs, and the cost of operating at wartime levels for 17 years have affected decisions to continue to transform and modernize the force. This FY 2009 budget submission balances the Air Force's modernization needs with operational and personnel program needs. The investments the Air Force is making in the systems and technologies will help the U.S. to maintain, and even increase, the technological advantage it has over its enemies. These investments will bring more capability and flexibility to Combatant Commanders for decades to come. A U.S. Air Force F-16 Fighting Falcon ai rcraft flown by Maj.

Defense agencies and field activities serve an important role by providing common capabilities centrally rather than establishing redundancies in each Military Department. The Department's organizational structure for defense agencies and field activities are shown in the Resource Exhibits (p. 227-8). Defense agencies provide a variety of support services used throughout the Department. DoD Field Activities also consolidate initiatives and perform missions more limited in scope than defense agencies. Select organizations and activities - such as the Defense Health Program (discussed in the Healthcare and Wounded Warrior chapter) - receive their own budget allocations to ensure adequate funding is provided for these special interest programs. The Defense-Wide submission advances key Department objectives including: Caring for Service members and their families through provision of high quality services including healthcare, education, and legal services; Prevailing in the Global War on Terror through the efforts of SOCOM to defeat terrorist networks through direct and indirect approaches and the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) to build partnership capacity through the training and equipping of U.S. Allies and partners; Defending the Homeland through investments in missile, chemical, and biological defense and counternarcotics; and Ensuring technology and information superiority through research, development, test, and evaluation. Further, this request includes critical enabling processes that ensure the Department is prepared to prosecute today's conflicts and respond to tomorrow's challenges through: Combat Support Agencies; and Management organizations that provide support to the Department's leadership.

DoD recognizes that military families' quality of life is an important consideration, and the Department is committed to providing a high level of support to meet their needs and expectations. This responsibility is particularly significant as Service members and their families sacrifice daily to guarantee our security and further U.S. national interests around the world. Congress has placed heavy emphasis on supporting active duty and Guard and Reserve members and their families. Both the Senate and the House supported continuity of family support funding in the baseline budget since these programs are an enduring need. This request reflects the importance placed on caring for Service members and their families. Agencies and field activities in support of that effort include: Military Healthcare* Defense Health Program (DHP) - $23.6 billion; and Military Medical Construction - $0.5 billion. Service Member and Family Assistance DoD Education Activity (DoDEA) - $2.1billion; and Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA) - $1.3 billion plus approximately $6.9 billion in Working Capital Funds Personnel Support and Care Defense Human Resources Activity (DHRA) - $0.6 billion; Defense Security Service (DSS) - $0.5 billion; Defense Media Activity (DMA) - $0.2 billion; Defense Acquisition University (DAU) - $0.1 billion; Defense Prisoner of War/Mission Personnel Office (DPMO) - <$0.1 billion; and U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces - <$0.1 billion. Military Healthcare For a detailed discussion of Military Healthcare, including the Defense Health Program, refer to the chapter on Healthcare and Wounded Warrior. Service Member and Family Assistance The DoD Education Activity (DoD EA) provides a world-class education program that prepares K-12 students in military communities around the world to be successful and responsible citizens in a dynamic global environment. The Department of *Other Military Health Care costs are funded in the Service Accounts: Military Personnel in support of Health Care - $7.1 billion; Health Care Accrual - $10.4B U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Julie Matyascik - December 2007U.S. Navy Operations Specialist 1st Class Oliver Williams greets his family after returning to Naval Station Norfolk, VA., following a six-month deployment in support of maritime security operations aboard the guided-missile destroyer USS Arleigh Burke (DDG 51). Arleigh Burke is a part of the Enterprise Carrier Strike Group. DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 DEFENSE-WIDE AGENCIES 56 Defense Dependents Schools educate 57,748 students in 132 schools located in 12 countries, while their domestic equivalent educates 29,286 students in 68 schools located in seven states. The DoDEA FY 2009 budget request of $2.1 billion supports a continuation of the President's Foreign Language Initiative which promotes the study of critical need languages in grades K-12, the Educational Partnership Program designed to ease the transition of dependents to stateside schools as a result of global rebasing, and an initiative to strengthen the high school (grades 9-12) program to include advanced studies and enhanced college and career counseling. The Department established the Joint Guard and Reserve Family Assistance program. Fami lies with limited previous exposure to military systems now must deal with the likelihood of multiple and longer deployments for the Service member. This program creates a joint family support platform that integrates Federal, state, local, and non-profit resources creating a community in each state. This effort began in six states, and has been expanded to nine additional states. Ten more states will begin implementation by March 2008. The commissary benefit, administered by the Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA), enhan ces military fam ilies' quality of life by providing them high quality grocery and household products at significant savings. DeCA continues to meet or exceed its performance goals, including increased sales without increased non-inflation costs; superior stewardship of funds; independent customer satisfaction ranking second among the U.S. largest private sector supermarket chains; and grocery savings of at least 30 percent compared to civilian supermarkets. Military personnel and families consistently rate the commissary among their most highly valued non-pay benefits. The FY 2009 budget submission for DeCA is $1.3 billion and supports the delivery of the commissary benefit as an integral part of the total compensation package for military personnel. Personnel Support and Care The Defense Human Resources Activity (DHRA) enhances the operational effectiveness and efficiency of a host of dynamic and diverse programs supporting the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness. DHRA supports policy development for cutting-edge research and expert analysis, supports readiness and departmental reengineering efforts, manages the largest automated personnel data repositories in the world, prepares tomorrow's leaders through robust developmental programs, supports recruiting and retaining the best and brightest, and delivers both benefits and critical services to warfighters and their families. The Field Activity's missions have expanded between FY 2008 and FY 2009 to support emerging requirements and new initiatives. DHRA is able to implement new technologies and leverage existing data repositories to support critical initiatives. These include: implementing Presidentially mandated Federal credentials for physical and logical access, accommodating and mitigating the wide-ranging impacts of BRAC decisions, and supporting the integration of pay and benefit delivery systems with significant changes in personnel management and policy. In FY 2009, DHRA also takes on centralized support of critical National Security Education initiatives and language capability programs needed by our operational comm anders to support emerging requirements around the world. The Defense Security Service (DSS) as the premier provider of personnel and industrial security services in the Department, supports national security and the warfighter, secures the Nation's technological base, and oversees the protection of U.S. and foreign classified information in the hands of industry. The DSS requests $0.5 billion to accomplish this mission by clearing industrial facilities, accrediting information systems, facilitating the personnel security clearance process, delivering security education and training, and providing information technology DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 DEFENSE-WIDE AGENCIES 57 services that support the industrial and personnel security missions of DoD and its partner agencies. In FY 2009, the Defense Media Activity (DMA) assumes the resources and functions of the former American Forces Information Service (AFIS), Air Force News Service Agency, Army and Air Force Hometown News Service, Marine Corps News, Naval Media Center, and the majority of the Soldiers Media Center. The Deputy Secretary directed this consolidation to implement a Base Closure and Realignment Commission recommendation and to achieve a streamlined organizational structure and opportunities for additional economies of scale in the execution of media functions. The Department requests $0.2 billion for DMA to provide a common service of high-quality news, DoD and command information, and entertainment. This activity meets the requirements of the Military Services and Combatant Commands' U.S. forces stationed worldwide to promote and sustain unit and individual readiness, situational awareness, quality of life, and morale. Through its news production, television, radio, newspaper, print news service, and World Wide Web distribution services and facilities, the DMA is the primary tool for the Secretary and senior leaders to communicate important messages, news, and information about DoD programs and activities. The Defense Acquisition University (DAU), with a $0.1 billion request, is a corporate Univer sity providing mandatory, assignment specific, and continuing education courses for military and civilian personnel serving in 14 acquisition career fields. It educates and trains professionals for effective service in the Defense acquisition system. The DAU coordinates the DoD acquisition education and training program to meet the training requirements of more than 125,000 personnel serving in acquisition positions. Through its regional campuses, the DAU sponsors acquisition curriculum and instructor training to provide a full range of basic, intermediate, and advanced courses to support the career goals and professional development of the acquisition workforce. The DAU also provides research, publications, symposia, and consulting in areas related to the acquisition functional areas. DAU is accredited by the Council on Occupational Education, a national institutional accrediting agency. The Defense Prisoner of War/Missing Personnel Office (DPMO) is a Field Activity that recovers and accounts for missing personnel from previous and current military operations. The FY 2009 funding request is $17 million for DPMO and remains stable, supporting case investigations, family outreach, and accounting of Americans lost in past conflicts (including World War II, the Cold War, the Korean War, the Vietnam Conflict, and the 1991 Gulf War). With White House sponsorship, DPMO proposed a national personnel recovery strategy that will, for the first time, direct USG agencies to plan, train, and equip for personnel recovery at the national and interagency levels. This will ensure USG efforts are synchronized and all USG personnel recovery operational and intelligence capabilities are fully integrated and prepared to respond to personnel recovery events. In FY 2009, DPMO will finalize and implement the Department's personnel recovery policy. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces reviews cases from all of the Armed Services which involve serious court-martial felony convictions and sentences which present legal issues of serious constitutional magnitude. Costs in FY 2009 total $13 million and include greater security and IT support requirements. This includes the use of more contracted security personnel and other security services. PREVAILING IN THE GLOBAL WAR ON TERROR The entire Department is committed to prosecuting the GWOT and succeeding in the Nation's fight against terrorists. Three Defense-Wide elements play particularly important roles: DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 DEFENSE-WIDE AGENCIES 58 Special Operations Command (SOCOM) - $5.7 billion; Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) - $1.0 billion; and The Joint Improvised Explosive Defeat Organization (JIEDDO) - $0.5 billion. Its FY 2009 request is included in the Army Procurement account. U.S. Special Operations Command Unlike other Combatant Commands, SOCOM receives direct Defense-Wide appropriations to ensure continuous support for and management of the unique training and equipment requirements of Special Operations Forces (SOF). SOCOM's mission is to provide fully capable SOF to defend the U.S. and its interests, and to plan and synchronize operations against terrorist networks. The U.S. is at war with a global enemy that can blend in with local populations and threaten our way of life. For this reason, the U.S. requires a small, yet highly skilled and robust organization that has the ability and resources to combat this enemy. SOCOM has been designated the lead DoD agency in the planning and synchronizing of operations for the GWOT. SOCOM also organizes, trains, equips, and deploys SOF to support Geographic COCOMs, Ambassadors, and their country teams. SOF are comprised of specially selected, trained, and organized Soldiers, Sailors, Marines, and Airmen, whose training, education, initiative, and experience set them apart from all others in the Department. The SOCOM FY 2009 budget request of $5.7 billion focuses on building SOF capabilities, capacity, and readiness to support a coherent strategy to find and fix terrorist networks through direct and indirect approaches. To support this strategy, SOCOM's FY 2009 budget estimate emphasizes increased capabilities to find and fix terrorist networks, synchronize GWOT planning and execution efforts, and begins a transitional shift in the global posture of SOF. Significant resources are required to support the growth of SOF personnel necessary to accomplish these initiatives and enhance SOCOM's ability to place its forces in exactly the right place on the global battlefield with the appropriate equipment, technology, and training. SOCOM's long term success in the GWOT depends largely upon its ability to rapidly employ a sustainable mix of capabilities. Non-traditional approaches are required to counter and defeat the elusive, asymmetric, and disruptive threats pervasive in today's operational environment. To meet this demand, SOCOM has invested in capabilities to improve systems, advance force operations, specialized training, A MH-47 helicopter slings a Special Operations Craft Riverine over a lake during an infiltration exercise.

SOCOM FY 2009 investments include: Unmanned Vehicles for Reconnaissance, Surveillance, Target Acquisition, Battle Damage Assessment, Intelligence Collection, and other beyond-visual-line-of-sight missions; Modified CV-22 aircraft for long range, high speed infiltration, exfiltration, and resupply to Special Forces teams in hostile, denied, and politically sensitive areas; Specialized aircraft capable of worldwide rapid deployment operations and penetration of hostile areas - MH-47 aircraft (currently the SOF platform of choice for executing the GWOT), the MH-60, and non-standard aviation assets; Replenishment of SOF ammunition for required training, combat missions, and war reserve stock; Recapitalization of the aging MC-130E/P airframes for clandestine or low visibility air refueling for SOF helicopters; Soldier Individual Protection and Survival Systems, which provide specialized equipment for SOF soldiers; and The Tactical Local Area Network (TACLAN), which provides advanced automated data processing and display capabilities to support situational awareness, mission planning and execution, and command and control of forces. Changes from the FY 2008 budget include increased funding of flight operations, communications, intelligence, management, equipment maintenance, and specialized skills training. The FY 2009 budget also supports five additional Special Forces battalions over the FYDP. Decreases in the FY 2009 budget include combat development activities and a decrease from the FY 2008 military construction request, which included the necessary facilities to support the growth of SOF, as stipulated in the 2006 QDR. Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) The mission of the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) is to lead, direct, and manage security cooperation programs and resources. DSCA's objectives are to build partner capacities, strengthen defense relationships, and support partner nations' abilities to fight the global war on terror and to participate in other coalition operations. It also seeks to foster access and influence through the management and execution of assigned security cooperation programs and activities, and to promote the growth of democratic ideals through international defense education, training, and other programs DSCA's FY 2009 request of $1.0 billion includes funding for: Global Train and Equip programs, which allows COCOMs and Ambassadors, working together, to train and equip foreign military forces in response to urgent and emergent threats or opportunities to solve problems before they become crises that require major military interventions (See chapter on Building Partnership Capacity for more detail); Security and Stabilization Assistance authority, which allows DoD to transfer funds to the Department of State to facilitate civilian stabilization and reconstruction missions, bringing to bear non-military tools critical for success in complex security environments; The Regional Centers for Security Studies, which help counter ideological support for terrorism, harmonize views on common security challenges, and build the capacity of partner national security institutions consistent with the norms of civil-military relations; DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 DEFENSE-WIDE AGENCIES 60 The Partnership for Peace Information Management System, which provides an infrastructure in support of bilateral and multilateral security cooperation; Regional International Outreach, which develops and fields common information technology to improve international outreach and collaboration efforts; The Humanitarian Assistance program, which assures friendly nations and Allies of our support and provides basic humanitarian aid and services to populations in need; The Humanitarian Mine Action (HMA) program, which provides access, training, and readiness-enhancing benefits to forces and contributes to alleviating the highly visible, worldwide problem of landmines, unexploded ordnance, and small arms ammunition; The Foreign Disaster Relief and Emergency Response (FDR/ER) program, which enables COCOMs to respond timely and effectively to disasters in their areas of responsibility and to manage the humanitarian considerations of security crises; and The Defense Coalition Support Account provides military equipment that many coalition partners require to deploy with U.S. forces, to participate in stability operations and counterterrorism operations through the world. This account purchases, and keeps on hand, items most needed by our coalition partners. Joint Improvised Explosive Defeat Organization (JIEDDO) The mission of the Joint Improvised Explosive Defeat Organization is to reduce the strategic influence of all forms of Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) against Joint and Coalition Forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. This requires a comprehensive approach that combines an aggressive offense with a solid defense. Prior to FY 2008, JIEDDO was funded entirely by supplemental appropriations. The $0.5 billion FY 2009 request funds three of JIEDDO's four line of operations: Attack the Network ($0.3 billion): Funds support fusing information, integrating new capabilities, and developing new tools for modeling and simulation. The JIEDDO provides the warfighter operationally integrated products to enable deployed forces to conduct offensive operations; Train the Force ($0.1 billion): Funds support individual and collective unit training prior to and during deployment for operations in an intense, fluid IED environment; Staff and Infrastructure ($0.1 billion): Funds provide the critical support structure of civilian personnel, facilities and personnel contracts, professional training and information contracts, travel, and supplies that enable the other lines of operation to produce results required in the C-IED effort; and Defeat the Device: No funds requested at this time. DEFENDING THE HOMELAND Defending the homeland is the U.S. military's most basic mission. It involves the deterrent posture and capabilities to convince adversaries that they cannot achieve their objectives by attacking the U.S. and consequence management capabilities should an attack occur. These capabilities include: Missile Defense Agency (MDA) - $9.3 billion; Chemical and Defense and Counternarcotics (CN) - $1.1 FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 DEFENSE-WIDE AGENCIES 61 Missile Defense Agency The mission of the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is to develop, test, and prepare for deployment a missile defense system. Using complimentary interceptors, land-, sea- air- and space- based sensors, and battle management command and control systems, the planned missile defense system will be able to engage all classes and ranges of ballistic missile threats in all phases of flight. The programmatic strategy is to develop, rigorously test and continuously evaluate production, deployment and operational alternatives for the ballistic missile defense system to provide emerging warfighting capability. In its FY 2009 request, the Department continues to develop, field, and sustain a layered Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) to protect the U.S., our Allies, and deployed forces from attacks by ballistic missiles of all ranges in all phases of flight. The strategic objectives for the BMDS are to maintain and sustain the initial capability, while continuing to close gaps and improve this capability against the current threat and provide options to address future emerging threats. Initiatives will continue the production and fielding of the integrated ground- based Missile Defense system; development of mobile Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) ground-based system; continued production and fielding of forward based radars; production and delivery of the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense mobile sea-based capability. See the Major Weapons Systems chapter for a further discussion of Missile Defense. Chemical and Biological Defense The Department's Chemical and Biological Defense Program (CBDP) is a key part of a comprehensive national strategy to counter the threat of chemical and biological weapons. The CBDP provides research, development, and acquisition programs primarily to support counterproliferation and consequence management. In support of counterproliferation, the DoD CBDP provides passive defenses tailored to the unique characteristics of the various chemical and biological weapons, including emerging threats. These capabilities provide U.S. forces the ability to rapidly and effectively mitigate the effects of a Chemical and Biological (CB) attack against deployed forces. In support of consequence management, the DoD CBDP provides capabilities to respond to the effects of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) used against U.S. forces deployed abroad and the homeland. U.S. Army Maj. Don Troxell, 115th Mobile Public Affairs Detachment commander, watches his unit as they leave the gas chamber in a chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear attack training exercise at Fort Dix, N.J. Troxell walked through the chamber as well and wears the black residue of a decontamination kit on his face. U.S. Army Photo - July 2007 DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 DEFENSE-WIDE AGENCIES 62 The CBDP funds research to exploit leading edge technologies to ensure that U.S. forces are equipped with world class capabilities to defend against CB threats in the coming years. The FY 2009 budget request includes support for a comprehensive science and technology base program to ensure continued advances in CB defense capabilities. CBDP Science and Technology research provides core capabilities to ensure U.S. technological advantages through the far term, including research into advanced chemical and biological detection systems, advanced materials for improved filtration systems and protection systems, advanced decontaminants, investigations into the environmental fate of chemical warfare agents, advanced information technologies, medical biological defense research, and medical chemical defense. Counternarcotics The clear linkages between international narcotics trafficking and international terrorism constitute a threat to U.S. national security interests. The global and regional terrorists who threaten U.S. interests can finance their activities with the proceeds from narcotics trafficking. The Department's counternarcotics efforts contribute to homeland defense, foster cooperation with U.S. agencies, strengthen alliances with partner nations, and form relationships with new international partners otherwise reluctant to cooperate with DoD in counter- terrorism and other military activity. In accordance with its statutory authorities, the Department will continue to use its counternarcotics resources as effectively and efficiently as possible to achieve national counternarcotics priorities, as well supporting efforts in the GWOT. The FY 2009 budget request of $1.1 billion will fund mandatory counternarcotics detection and monitoring missions; permissive counternarcotics support (information sharing and building partner capacity) to domestic and host nation law enforcement and/or military forces; and drug demand reduction activities internal to the Department. ENSURING TECHNOLOGY AND INFORMATION SUPERIORITY Technology and information are critical enablers to success in both asymmetric and conventional warfare. The Department strives to stay on the leading edge of innovation through its investments in: Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) - $3.3 billion; Test Resource Management Center (TRMC) - $0.2 billion; Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC) - $0.1 billion; and Defense Technology Security Administration (DTSA) - <$0.1 billion. DARPA's mission is to maintain the technological superiority of the U.S. military and prevent technological surprise from harming national security by sponsoring revolutionary, high-payoff research that bridges the gap between fundamental discoveries and their military use. DARPA conducts its mission by searching worldwide for revolutionary high-payoff ideas and then sponsoring research projects that bridge the gap between fundamental discoveries and their military use. DARPA is the Department's only research agency not tied to a specific operational mission; it supplies technological options for the entire Department and is designed to be a specialized \"technological engine\" for transforming DoD. DARPA's FY 2009 request for $3.3 billion would fund a joint Air Force/DARPA program to develop technologies for rapid access to space and hypersonic cruise vehicles; enhancements to Command, Control, and Communications systems; and DARPA agency relocations. The Test Resource Management Center (TRMC) oversees proposed budgets and expenditures for DoD's test and evaluation facilities, develops a strategic plan for test and DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 DEFENSE-WIDE AGENCIES 63 evaluation at these facilities, and assesses the adequacy of the Major Range and Test Facility Base to support the development and fielding of major weapon systems. It administers and executes the Science and Technology/Test and Evaluation Program, which develops technologies to verify the performance of advanced weapon systems. TRMC's FY 2009 request of $0.2 billion would enable it to complete and continue efforts to improve test and evaluation capabilities. The Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC) provides timely and effective exchange of Scientific and Technical Information and Research & Engineering Information. DTIC's FY 2009 request of $0.1 billion funds continued development, technical support, and hosting services for more than 100 DoD websites with an average of 65 million accesses per month. It also provides core funding, management, and oversight for 10 Information Analysis Centers, which collect, analyze, synthesize, and disseminate scientific and technical information. The Defense Technology Security Administration (DTSA) prevents the transfer of sensitive technologies that threaten U.S. military superiority to countries that pose security threats. DTSA's FY 2009 $34 million request will fund continued protection of critical technologies. PROVIDING COMBAT SUPPORT Combat Support Agencies (CSAs) fulfill combat support or combat service support functions for joint operating forces across the range of military operations, and in support of combatant commanders executing military operations. Combat Support Agencies include: Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) - $2.1 billion appropriated ($8.0 billion including Working Capital Funds); Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) - $1.2 billion; Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) - $1.1 billion; Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) - $0.9 billion appropriated ($38.9 billion including Working Capital Funds); and Intelligence Agencies and Activities - Classified. Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) DISA is responsible for planning, engineering, acquiring, fielding, and supporting global net-centric solutions. The goal of net-centricity is to provide the right information to the right person at the right time. DISA focuses on connecting warfighters to one another and to critical information in a trusted and timely manner. DISA seeks to provide a network and capabilities that U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist Seaman David A.

Tarawa and embarked 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit are on a deployment to the Western Pacific in support of maritime security operations and the war on terror. DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 DEFENSE-WIDE AGENCIES 64 will meet the demands of the GWOT and commanders' needs for information; be available and secure to effect military operations around the globe; and be agile and flexible enough to keep pace with technology and the increasing demands for authentic trusted information. DISA also provides systems to help simplify the complex interoperability issues associated with coalition warfare and homeland security. The FY 2009 request of $2.1 billion would fund DISA's key missions: Transition to a net-centric environment, including Net-Centric Enterprise Services, in which data is continuously available in a trusted environment to enable decision-making superiority that results in increased mission effectiveness; Build and sustain a secure Global Information Grid (GIG) transport infrastructure that eliminates bandwidth constraints and rapidly surges to meet demands, wherever and whenever needed. In addition to its appropriated funds DISA finances sustainment of the GIG via the Defense Working Capital Fund (DWCF) and reimbur sements from customer accounts; and Transition to enterprise-wide capabilities for command and control and combat support that exploit the GIG for improved decision-making. The Net-Enabled Command Capability (NECC) dynamically and persistently matches warfighter command and control (C2) requirements to capability development to identify and prioritize Joint warfighter needs and expedite getting solutions to the field. Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) The Defense Threat Reduction Agency provides a variety of means supporting a layered defense strategy to counter WMD. DTRA's efforts cut across the three pillars of the National Strategy to Combat WMD: nonproliferation, counterproliferation, and consequence management. DTRA further serves as the primary Combat Support Agency for the U.S. Strategic Command in its role as lead COCOM for integrating and synchronizing combating WMD efforts. DTRA provides integrated technical and operational solutions and provides the intellectual capital to shape both DoD and national-level policies and strategies to address WMD. The $1.2 billion FY 2009 budget request will allow DTRA to bring a dedicated, full-time, U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Kyle D.

Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) The Defense Contract Management Agency serves as America's vital link between the warfighter and industry. The DCMA uses its insight into contractor operations to produce predictive information about contractor capability to meet program goals and schedules. As a combat support agency, DCMA provides customers with contract management and acquisition support services wherever and whenever needed. The FY 2009 budget request of $1.1 billion reflects a decrease in full time equivalent personnel (FTEs) and the associated reduction in travel, training, and equipment purchases. Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) The Defense Logistics Agency is responsible for providing worldwide logistics support for the missions of the Military Departments and the COCOMs under conditions of peace and war. Responsibilities include the acquisition, storage, and distribution of most of the Department's spare parts and other consumable items, reutilization and marketing of excess military property, document automation services, and operation of the Defense National Stockpile. The FY 2009 budget request of $0.9 billion includes an increase for recapitalization of fuel facilities and continued levels of funding for research, development, testing, and evaluation. Intelligence Functions Combat support agencies with intelligence functions are discussed in detail in the chapter on Intelligence. Leadership Support A number of Defense-Wide agencies and activities exist to support civilian and military leaders as they guide the Department and support the warfighter: Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) - $4.2 billion; Washington Headquarters Services (WHS) - $0.9 billion; Joint (JS) - Contract Agency (DCAA) billion; Business Transformation Agency (BTA) - $0.3 Office of the Inspector General (OIG) - $0.2 billion; Office of Economic Adjustment (OEA) - $0.1 billion; National Defense University (NDU) - $0.1 billion; Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) - <$0.1 billion appropriated ($1.4 billion including the Working Capital Fund); and Defense Legal Services Agency (DLSA) - <$0.1 billion. Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) The Office of the Secretary of Defense is the principal staff element of the Secretary for the exercise of policy development, planning, resource management, fiscal, and program evaluation responsibilities. The FY 2009 request of $4.2 billion funds the staff, offices, and special projects for each of the Secretary's Principal Staff Advisors ($1.7 billion). The single largest program funded in the Operation and Maintenance account is the Commanders' Exercise Engagement and Training Transformation (CE2T2) Program ($0.7 billion), which is managed by the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness. The Science and Technology program of the Director for Defense Research and Engineering constitutes the majority of the RDT&E program ($2.4 billion). The OSD also requests $0.1 billion for procurement of equipment. DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 DEFENSE-WIDE AGENCIES 66 Washington Headquarters Services (WHS) The Washington Headquarters Services is a field activity that provides centralized, consolidated administrative and operational support to DoD activities in the National Capital Region. The FY 2009 request of $0.9 billion funds Pentagon and General Services Administration (GSA) rents, information technology, supplies and support services for OSD and other components, and BRAC-related costs ($0.3 billion). The Operation and Maintenance account request of $0.5 billion includes additional funding (<$0.1 billion) and 75 civilian billets to provide the level of support required by the OSD and other components. The WHS also requests military construction and procurement funding (<$0.1 billion). Joint Staff (JS) The Joint Staff supports the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in his role as the principal military adviser to the President, the Secretary, and the National Security Council. The Chairman relies upon the expertise resident on the Joint Staff to craft and promulgate guidance for combatant forces' unified strategic direction, operation under unified command, and integration into an efficient team of land, naval, and air forces. In this capacity, the Joint Staff meets the Nation's security challenges and facilitates its strategic objectives by providing Combatant Commands, Services, and U.S. warfighters with joint policy, strategy, and doctrine. Joint Staff funding, requested at $0.5 billion for FY 2009, guarantees the joint readiness and training needed to ensure U.S. capability to employ joint combat forces worldwide. Several programs combine to make up the Joint Staff's funding request. Historically, 58 percent of all Joint Staff funding directly supports Combatant Command operations. The Combating Terrorism Readiness Initiatives Fund; the COCOM Initiatives Fund; the COCOM Command and Control Initiatives Program; the Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence for the Warrior program; the Planning and Decision Aid System; and the Joint Theater Air and Missile Defense Organization all directly support the COCOMs. The Joint Staff also budgets for the joint data and analytic support programs and the day-to-day operations and facility rent of the Joint Staff. Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) The Department requests $0.4 billion for the Defense Contract Audit Agency, which is responsible for performing all necessary contract audits for the Department and providing accounting and financial advisory services regarding contracts and subcontracts to all DoD Components responsible for procurement and contract administration. These services are provided in connection with negotiation, administration, and settlement of contracts and subcontracts. DCAA also provides contract audit support to all DoD components as part of the military operations and reconstruction effort in Iraq. DCAA's contract audit function is an integral part of the oversight and management controls instituted by the DoD to ensure integrity and regulatory compliance by Defense contractors. Business Transformation Agency (BTA) As the single agency responsible for DoD Enterprise business transformation functions, the BTA establishes and enforces requirements, principles, standards, systems, procedures, and practices governing business transformation. For FY 2009, with a request of $0.3 billion, the BTA will work to support business operations. Office of the Inspector General (OIG) The Office of the Inspector General independently and objectively audits, investigates, inspects, and evaluates the program and operations of the Department to recommend policies and process improvements that promote economy, DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 DEFENSE-WIDE AGENCIES 67 efficiency, and effectiveness and detect and prevent fraud, waste, and abuse in DoD programs and operations. Over the last three years, the OIG has achieved $23.9 billion in savings and $4.9 billion in recoveries for the nation. The Inspector General is the only DoD official qualified to issue opinions on the financial statements of the DoD. The OIG also informs DoD management and Congress about the problems and deficiencies in programs and operations and the progress of corrective actions. In FY 2008, Congress increased OIG funding to provide enhanced contractor oversight. The OIG hired 73 additional auditors, evaluators, criminal investigators, and required support staff to meet this need. The OIG implemented an initiative to improve training for Combatant Command and joint inspectors general supported by five additional positions. The FY 2009 budget request supports the annualized civilian FTEs staffing (growth of 78 FTEs compared to FY 2007 levels). The FY 2009 program also includes the implementation of the Secretary's decision to transfer the Intelligence Oversight function with nine FTEs from the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Intelligence Oversight to the OIG. Office of Economic Adjustment (OEA) The Department's Office of Economic Adjustment assists communities that are adverse ly impacted by Department changes. Technical and financial assistance provided under this program ensure affected communities can plan and carry out local adjustment strategies, engage the private sector in ventures to plan and/or undertake economic development and base redevelopment, and partner with the Military Departments as they implement BRAC actions in support of the DoD mission. The amount of OEA funding gradually declines as the BRAC execution timeline ends. The funding levels also vary depending on actual community needs National Defense University (NDU) The National Defense University's $0.1 billion in funding supports the premier academic c enter for joint professional military education, preparing military and civilian leaders from the U.S. and other countries to evaluate national and international security challenges through multidisciplinary educational and research programs, professional exchanges, and outreach. Components of the Washington, DC based university include, but are not limited to, the National War College, Industrial College of the Armed Forces, Information Resources Management College, Institute for National Strategic Studies, and Joint Forces Staff College.

In each of these priorities, advances have been made. Budget Priorities Intelligence Healthcare and Wounded Warrior Combatant Commands, particularly the standup of Africa Command Building Partnership Capacity National Guard and Reserve Cyberspace Initiatives Enterprise Initiatives Capability Portfolios President's Management Agenda Performance Improvement Financial Management Accomplishments CAPABILITY PORTFOLIOS DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 CAPABILITY PORTFOLIOS 70 Capability Portfolios OVERVIEW The Department constantly strives to reshape its defense enterprise to better support the joint warfighter and ensure it is best positioned to respond to the threat environment of today and tomorrow. To advance these objectives, the Department has been shifting away from a threat-based and toward a capabilities-based approach to force development since 2001. The Department's historically threat-based approach was designed during the Cold War to ensure success against a limited set of specific threat scenarios. A capabilities-based approach, on the other hand, is designed to deal with an uncertain threat environment by focusing on developing capabilities for a wide range of threat scenarios. This framework is better suited to building the multi-capable, agile, and adaptive joint forces needed to deal with the dynamic nature of current and future threat environments. CAPABILITY PORTFOLIOS Developing a common understanding of the Department's capabilities was a necessary step in moving towards a capabilities-based approach. In May 2005, the Secretary of Defense directed that the Department begin using common capability definitions, known as Joint Capability Areas (JCAs), to describe missions and functional activities performed by the joint force. Since that time, the Department has been finalizing the definition and composition of each JCA. Joint Capability Areas are the basis for Capability Portfolios, which provide the Department a cross-component view of capability investments. CAPABILITY PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT In 2006, the Department selected four of the most mature portfolios - Command and Control, Net Centric, Battlespace Awareness, and Logistics - to serve as pilots in capability portfolio management. A Capability Portfolio Manager (CPM), typically a component such as a Combatant Command or Under Secretary, was assigned to each portfolio to act as an advocate, similar to how a Service would advocate for and assess risk across its programs. CPMs participated in the FY 2009 Program Review process and in developing the Department's guidance for development of the force. The type of analysis conducted by the four pilot CPMs can be seen below. Each has established an agreed upon definition, a vision for the future capability, and identified focus areas. Fleet Composite Squadron Six (VC-6) conducts boat operations off the coast of Naval Station Norfolk, VA. VC-6 provides training and support to maximize fleet readiness and mission accomplishment with vital real time airborne reconnaissance capabilities and provides realistic aerial and sea-borne threat simulations. U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class David Danals - August 2007 DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 CAPABILITY PORTFOLIOS 71 Battlespace Awareness Battlespace Awareness is the ability to understand dispositions and intentions as well as the characteristics and conditions of the operational environment that bear on national and military decision-making. Today's threat environment is complex, ranging from irregular warfare endemic of the major campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan to nation-states and non-state actors determined to develop and obtain sophisticated weapons systems. The environment is also multi-dimensional, including land, sea, air, space, and cyberspace. The Battlespace Awareness (BA) Capability Portfolio must continue to improve the Department's capability to gain access, monitor these developments, and provide timely and accurate assessments. An optimal BA portfolio ensures a professional, fully integrated, and seamless enterprise providing the best Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) and Environmental Information possible, whenever and wherever, in support of the warfighter and Nation. The BA enterprise will work to strengthen capabilities that anticipate and counter threats posed by nation-states, non-state actors, and ungoverned spaces of the world to meet the challenges of a protracted, irregular, and global war against terror. The number one focus of the portfolio is the warfighter. The military relies heavily on the systems and capabilities that the BA Portfolio brings to the fight. Each component supports that effort through the operation of unique and specialized capabilities. In addition to the warfighter on the frontline, the BA Portfolio supports Department and national policy-makers and weapons acquisition communities. To this end, the BA Portfolio is focused on effectively integrating the Department's programs and capabilities with the overarching Intelligence Community and the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) National Intelligence Program (NIP). The integration and synchronization of these capabilities magnify the BA CPM's ability to serve both Departmental and national missions. Further, expanding intelligence sharing with national and international partners will enhance the Department's capabilities, as well as those of its partners. Moving forward, the BA CPM will extend, expand, and explore those critical capabilities' and technologies that better leverage National Intelligence to meet operational warfighter requirements while simultaneously seeking to eliminate threats to our own forces and capabilities. By definition, the CPM intends to: 1) extend the U.S. Intelligence Enterprise to the warfighter and then back into the enterprise with key tactical capabilities as appropriate; 2) expand by providing new capabilities the warfighter needs not currently provided by the BA portfolio; and 3) explore by looking for new opportunities to address emerging needs and threats and eliminate by ensuring we protect the Intelligence Enterprise from our adversaries. Focus Areas The main components of the BA Portfolio are ISR and Environment. ISR is the ability to conduct required activities to meet intelligence needs of national and military decision makers. Environment depicts the ability to obtain and maintain situation specific information on objects, events, people, system status, interactions, environmental conditions, and other factors that affect the operational environm ent from a non-adversarial perspective. Proposed BA enhancements over the Future Years Defense Program (FYDP) focus on areas including persistence, survivability, and situational awareness to achieve an optimal mix of BA capabilities. By exploring new technologies within ISR areas, particular emphasis was placed on capabilities and capacity to \"find, fix, and finish\" high value individuals, assets, and WMD. Similarly, resources were committed to expanding ISR with DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 CAPABILITY PORTFOLIOS 72 sufficient access, coverage, dwell, revisit, responsiveness, and quality to provide required levels of persistence. Finally, the BA CPM stressed operationalizing and strengthening defense intelligence by extending national st rategic capabilities forward to the tactical level and improving distributed operations for intelligence collection systems an d analytic capabilities. The BA FYDP request responds to the Defense Intelligence Guidance published in June 2007 and includes the following priorities: Operationalizing and strengthening intelligence - Initiatives that will move us toward that goal include: enhancements to full motion video; operational implementation of the Joint Intelligence Operations Center enterprise; balanced investments between transformation and recapitalization of key capabilities; and investments in measurement and signatures intelligence and human derived intelligence; Enhancing security and reducing vulnerabilities via improvements to our counterintelligence capabilities, expansion of high value target locating and tracking ability, and enhanced human intelligence, language skills, and cultural awareness; Developing the defense intelligence workforce in-line with recent Congressional direction authorizing a Defense Civilian Intelligence Personnel System (DCIPS), giving defense intelligence components the authorities necessary to hire, develop, and retain a diverse, versatile, and professional workforce; and Improving management and alignment of defense intelligence resources by improving the portfolio processes within which we can manage the Military Intelligences Program (MIP), DoD elements of the NIP, and resources supporting Situational Awareness. To provide greater visibility, transparency, flexibility, more efficient management, and better investment decisions. Command and Control (C2) Command and Control is the ability to exercise authority and direction by a properly designated commander, or decision maker, over assigned and attached forces in the accomplishment of the mission. Command and control functions are performed through an arrangement of personnel, equipment, communications, facilities, and procedures employed by a commander in planning, directing, coordinating, and controlling forces and operations. Today's missions are simultaneously more complex and dynamic requiring the collective capabilities and efforts of many organizations to achieve desired outcomes across the range of military operations. Commanders must have the ability to command and control (C2) an interdependent force in rapidly changing scenarios involving complex, distributed, simultaneous, and/or sequential operations. Capabilities underpinning future operations must be able to disseminate commander's intent, enable collaborative and adaptive planning and execution, and enable the synchronized application of linear, non-linear, kinetic, and non-kinetic effects across a global landscape. In support of these capabilities, the Department's efforts in the C2 area must be guided and remain true to the principle maxim of command and control, which is that technology enables the human interface and supports \"command\" and the decision-maker, rather than forcing the decision-maker to operate within the constraints of the \"control\" technology. The force development community must remain cognizant of this so that C2 technical solutions meet the Commander's needs. Efforts must extend beyond the technology aspect of C2 and recognize that our networks will never be impervious to enemy attack and degradation. Our forces must be trained, educated, and organized to lessen our reliance on technical solutions and DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 CAPABILITY PORTFOLIOS 73 strengthen our C2 capability, from Joint Task Force (JTF) capable service headquarters through small high performing units, thus lessening our vulnerability to enemy attacks. Transformation of current C2 capabilities from Service and Agency oriented constructs must reflect a balanced mix of Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Leadership, Personnel, and Facility (DOTMLPF) solutions. These solutions must satisfy warfighter desired operational needs and provide capabilities that are interoperable, timely, accessible, complete, secure, accurate, simple, and relevant. They must improve non- interoperable legacy capabilities, migrate to future capabilities, identify and mitigate capability gaps and be balanced by an integrated DOTMLPF approach that reduces over reliance on complex technologies and enterprise networks. Focus Areas The C2 CPM, in coordination with the Services and COCOMs, conducted detailed analysis of C2 programs of interest and associated non-materiel solutions. CPM analysis provided the basis to develop a recommended investment strategy beginning in FY 2009 for addressing capability gaps, redundancies, and enhancements required to satisfy validated warfighter mission needs. Key components of the recommended capability enhancements and associated investment strategy include: Net-Enabled Command Capability (NECC) - NECC dynamically and persistently couples warfighter C2 requirements to capability development to identify and prioritize Joint warfighter needs and expedite getting solutions into the field. This enables responsive, flexible, and adaptable management structures that fully support the rapidly changing requirements and provides timely C2 capabilities to the warfighter. NECC development supports Department objectives to develop integrated strategic, operational, and tactical C2 capabilities by employing Over the South Pacific a US Air Force (USAF) Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) aircraft, 941st AWACS prepares to make contact with a USAF KC-135 Stratotanker, 909th Air Refueling Squadron (ARS), Kadena Air Base (AB), Okinawa.

While sustaining critical point-to-point and circuit-switched systems, NECC execution supports Department objectives to migrate current C2 functionality to a net-centric construct with phase-out of the Global Command and Control Family of Systems (GCCS FoS); Integrated Fires/Blue Force Tracking - Provides more accurate, timely, and efficient identification of entities within the Battlespace and reduces the time to deliver weapons on the target while reducing the possibility of fratricide; Deployable Command and Control - Provides the capability to rapidly establish command and control capabilities for new or emerging missions and facilitates command and control activities; and Common Tactical Picture - Promotes critical capability for automated planning and execution that will provide operational flexibility for the accurate and timely use of net enabled weapons and facilitate delivery of a Common Tactical Picture to the Joint Force. Net-Centric Net-Centric is the ability to provide a framework for full human and technical connectivity and interoperability that allows all Department users and external mission partners to share the information they need, when they need it, in a form they can understand and act on with confidence, and protects information from those who should not have it. The Net-Centric (NC) Capability Portfolio contains the end-to-end information infrastructure for the Department that provides the above-defined capability. The NC portfolio serves and enables all other Capability Portfolios and users within the Department. As a central focus of the Department's transformation efforts, the development, synchronization, and integration of NC capabilities delivered from across various Service and Agency providers is critical to making information a shared resource and a force multiplier. The Net-Centric Capability Portfolio vision is to harness the power of information and network connectivity. By enabling critical relationships among organizations and people, the Department is able to improve the quality of decisions and accelerate the speed of business process, information sharing, operational decision-making, and actions that achieve desired outcomes. The focus of the NC portfolio over the FYDP includes the following goals: Transform the Force - From an information perspective, NC capabilities must be fully aligned with the Department's transition from Service-centric capabilities to a net-centric enterprise that meets the global requirements of the entire Department, while increasing Joint warfighter effectiveness; Operationalize Cyberspace - Dominant operations in cyberspace will remain a necessary condition for military and non-military mission success in global, regional, and domestic theaters; and Optimize Information Sharing - To reach the Department's Information Sharing Strategic vision - deliver the power of information to ensure mission success - an effective operational net-centric environment is critical. The Department is shaping and transforming relevant culture, policies, and governance toward information sharing, as well as developing and deploying capabilit ies to discover, access and exchange information in an assured and timely manner, with an increasing emphasis on edge users and the extended enterprise. DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 CAPABILITY PORTFOLIOS 75 Focus Areas The NC Capability Portfolio is comprised of four areas that combine to provide end-to-end network connectivity, assured information sharing services, associated hosting and storage infrastructure, and the means to operate, optimize, and defend all network resources including management of the electromagnetic spectrum. Information Transport capabilities provide the end-to-end communications for the NC environment. Information Transport includes military satellite communications systems, the global terrestrial wire and fiber backbone, leased commercial communications capacity and managed services, operational and tactical wired and wireless networking capabilities, post, camp, and station communications facilities and purchased services, among others. Major development programs delivering these capabilities include the Wideband Global System, Mobile User Objective System, TSAT, Advanced EHF system, Warfighter Information Network-Tactical, Joint Tactical Radio System, and the Defense Information System Network. Information Assurance (IA) capabilities provide the measures that protect, defend, and restore information and information systems. IA capabilities enable secure information exchange, protection of data and networks, and detection and response to computer network attack. These capabilities are delivered largely by Service and Agency Information Systems Security Programs (ISSPs). In addition, specific IA programs, such as the DoD Public Key Infrastructure, Key Management Initiative and High Assurance Internet Protocol Encryptors deliver transformational capabilities. Enterprise Services capabilities provide to all authorized users an awareness of and access to all Department information and Department-wide information services. This includes \"core\" enterprise services designated by the Chief Information Officer for enterprise-wide use, such as discovery (i.e. of data, people or services such as \"web\" services), collaboration, mediation between diverse computer-based services and data sources, and messaging (e.g. instant messaging). The Net-Centric Enterprise Services (NCES) program is a key program delivering core DoD photo by Cpl. Sheila M. Brooks, U.S. Marine Corps. - April 2007U.S. Marine Corps Lance Cpl.

DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 CAPABILITY PORTFOLIOS 76 enterprise services. Computing infrastructure and information sharing capabilities provide scalabl e, distributed, and enterprise data processing, storage/shared space, and adaptable hosting resources Department-wide that work inter-dependently with core services to enable sharing of information, applications, and services globally, regionally, and to the tactical edge, to meet dynamic mission and operational needs. Computing infrastructure capabilities are exemplified by computing nodes such as enterprise (e.g. Defense Enterprise Computing Center (DECC)), regional, modular deployable, mobile tactical, and end user devices. Also included in Enterprise Services are the Department's Position, Navigation, and Timing capabilities, including the Global Positioning System program and associated user equipment currently being modernized to take advantage of new robust and precision capabilities. Net Management capabilities provide the ability to operate, optimize, and defend the net to include configuration and re- configuration of networks, applications, services, and the underlying physical assets that provide assured connectivity and end-user services. The NC Capability Portfolio includes Net Management capabilities and operations ranging from global, exemplified by the Joint Task Force for Global Network Operations (JTF-GNO), to system-oriented capabilities such as the TSAT Mission Operations System. The emergence of cyberspace as a distinct warfighting domain imposes additional Net Management capability needs to ensure situational awareness and the impact on network and spectrum resources is managed and controlled across offensive and defensive cyberspace operations. Logistics Logistics is the ability to project and sustain a ready joint force through the deliberate sharing of national and multi-national resources to effectively support operations, extend operational reach and provide the Joint Force Commander (JFC) the freedom of action necessary to meet mission objectives. The future operating environment will present joint logisticians with complex challenges. The joint force will operate in densely populated urban areas, inhospitable regions, along the littorals, and in remote austere locations. In an increasingly interconnected world, regional crisis can quickly expand well beyond the boundaries of the affected region or the immediate cause of the conflict, necessitating non-contiguous sustainment support obligations and demanding requirements of the DoD global supply chain. The Department must continue to improve its logistics capability and processes to meet the demands of this new operational environment as well as secure, enhance,, and protect its global supply network and en-route infrastructure. The mission of Joint Logistics is to support the projection and sustainment of a ready, capable total force across the range of military operations through globally responsive, operationally precise, and cost-effective logistics support for the Joint Force. There are three goals underpinning this effort: Unity of effort is the synchronization and integration of joint, multinational, interagency, and nongovernmental logistics capabilities focused on the Joint Force Commander's intent; Visibility assures access to information about logistics processes, resources, and requirements in order to gain the knowledge necessary to make effective decisions; and Rapid and precise response ensures the ability of Joint Logistics to meet the constantly changing needs of the joint force. DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 CAPABILITY PORTFOLIOS 77 Focus Areas The Joint Logistics Capability Portfolio Manager (CPM) has developed an overarching strategic vision for future logistics capabilities. Joint Logistics consists of seven areas that combine to integrate and improve end-to-end Joint Logistics first across DoD components, agencies, and global industry partners; then with other Federal agencies and alliances or coalitions in order to achieve better outcomes for joint warfighters. A Joint Logistics Capability Area Manager is assigned to each one of the seven areas. DoD Components, working in tandem with the Joint Logistics Capability Area Managers, will map initiatives and key programs of record to goals and objectives and will review the way in which Logistics Portfolio capabilities are managed, allocated, and used. Supply is the ability accurately fore cast requirements, identify and select supply sources, schedule deliveries, receive, verify and transfer product and authorize supplier payments. It includes the ability to see and manage inventory levels, capital assets, business rules, supplier networks, and agreements (to include import requirements) as well as the assessment of supplier performance. The focus on supply will leverage procurement processes to provide best value support to the warfighter. Maintain is the ability to manufacture and retain or restore materiel in a serviceable condition to achieve world class, agile maintenance capabilities that support the full spectrum of military operations is the focus of maintain. It includes inspecting, testing, servicing, repairing, rebuilding, overhauling, upgrading, and manufacturing. Deployment/Distribution is the ability to plan, coordinate, synchronize, and execute force movement and sustainment tasks in support of military operations. Deployment and distribution includes ability to strategically and operationally move forces and sustainment to the point of need and operate the Joint Deployment and Distribution Enterprise (JDDE). Key components include: moving and sustaining the force and operating the JDDE. Operational Contract Support is the ability to orchestrate and synchronize the provision of integrated contract support and management of contractor personnel providing that support to the joint force in a designated operational area.

DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 CAPABILITY PORTFOLIOS 78 Operational Engineering is the ability to execute and integrate engineering capabilities to assure mobility, provide infrastructure to position, project, and sustain the joint force, and enhance visualization of the operational area, to meet the National and JFC requirements. Three key components include general, combat, and geospatial engineering Logistics Services is the ability to provide laundry/shower/ textile repair; food service; water and ice services; basecamp services; hygiene services; and mortuary affairs functions essential to the technical management and support of the joint force in an expeditionary environment. Force Health Protection is the ability to: assess, develop, and implement capabilities that support psychological health of our warfighters; identify and prioritize gaps to improve speed and precision for delivery to warfighter care; identify and enhance joint theater medical command and control to improve patient and medical commodity visibility and enhance effective decision- making; and assess and develop combat multiplier programs to substantively enhance human performance on the battlefield. SUMMARY The Capability Portfolio Management pilot program has demonstrated that there is value in viewing Department activities through a capability portfolio lens to offer an alternative to the traditional component perspective in determining risk and resource trades. Future roles of the CPMs will include developing guidance for development of the force, evaluating and recommending changes to the Department's resource execution plans, managing the identification of solutions to prioritized capability gaps, and monitoring resource execution to ensure strategy alignment. Managing resources by Capability Portfolio, in addition to by Service and by appropriation account allows the Department to better align outputs to strategic objectives and make informed tradeoffs. The goal is to provide capabilities to the joint warfighter more rapidly and efficiently, while improving interoperability, minimizing redundancies and gaps, and maximizing effectiveness. The Department's appr oach to Capability Port folios will evolve over the next year as business rules and methodologies for aligning resources are finalized. For example, the Department is developing budget displays that will show each budget element linked to the appropriate capability portfolio. Viewing the budget in terms of Capability Portfolios is another way to explain to Congress and the American people how the Department is meeting new and emerging requirements. We look forward to continuing this dialogue as we advance the capability portfolios construct. U.S. Air Force Tech. Sgt.

Kim Allain - August 2007 INTELLIGENCE DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 INTELLIGENCE 79 Intelligence OVERVIEW Intelligence plays a critical role in providing national leadership and military commanders information about events and issues that impact national security. Decision-makers need accurate and timely information about the intentions and capabilities of foreign adversaries including terrorists - those we face on the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan today and those we may face at home and abroad tomorrow. Actionable military intelligence can save the lives of Americans, particularly those on the front lines - the men and women of the Military Services - and assist in identifying, tracking, and apprehending of our enemies. The Intelligence Community (IC) is a hybrid organization within the Federal government. It includes independent agencies and elements of major Federal departments. It is coordinated and overseen by the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) who is the President's principal authority on national intelligence. The Secretary of Defense, through the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) oversees military intelligence in coordination with the DNI. The budget for national intelligence is presented to Congress by the DNI; the budget for military intelligence is presented to Congress by the Secretary of Defense through the offices of the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) and the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller). INTELLIGENCE REFORM In the wake of 9/11, the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 reorganized the IC by establishing the position of DNI. The DNI became responsible for determining the annual budget for national intelligence activities, facilitating information sharing throughout the community, and establishing strategic direction and common standards for personnel.

The Department of Defense retained responsibility for its intelligence-related components, including the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), National Security Agency (NSA), and the Counterintelligence Field Activity (CIFA). Outside of the Defense Department, the IC continues to include the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research, and the intelligence components of: the Department of Homeland Security, including the Coast Guard; Department of Energy; Department of the Treasury; Federal Bureau of Investigation; and Drug Enforcement Agency - all of which report to the DNI on national intelligence matters. FUNDING AND CONGRESSIONAL OVERSIGHT The President's budget requests for military intelligence and national intelligence are provided to Congress under separate cover by the Secretary of Defense and the DNI, respectively. For reasons of national security, the amount of funding appropriated for intelligence organizations, the number of their employees, and their operations are all classified. This year, however, a new Federal law-- Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 - required the DNI to disclose the aggregate amount of funds appropriated for National Intelligence within 30 days of the end of the fiscal year. Detailed budget justification of these programs and activities can be found in classified annexes to the FY 2009 President's Budget, which will be presented to at least six Congressional committees: the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, House Armed Services Commi ttee, Senate Armed Services Committee, the House Appropriations Committee, and the Senate Appropriations Committee. Other congressional committees are briefed on intelligence activities when they have jurisdiction over parts of the Intelligence Community, such as the House Homeland Security Commi ttee, the Judiciary Committees the House Foreign Affairs Committee, or the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. MILITARY AND NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE PROGRAMS Appropriations for intelligence activities are divided between the Military Intelligence Program (MIP) and National Intelligence Program (NIP). The MIP is prepared by the Secretary of Defense and funds all programs, projects, or activities that support the Department's intelligence, counterintelligence, and related surveillance and reconnaissance activities. The MIP was established in September of 2005 and replaced the previous aggregation of intelligence activities know as Tactical Intelligence and Related Activities (TIARA) and the Joint Military Intelligence Program (JMIP). TIARA covered individual Service programs for tactical military intelligence, and JMIP included programs that responded to Defense-Wide and national intelligence requirements. The DNI is responsible for developing and determining the annual NIP budget, formerly known as the National Foreign Intelligence Program, which funded activities related only to foreign intelligence. Today the DNI is explicitly responsible for oversight of both foreign and domestic intelligence. The DNI is responsible for consulting and coordinating with the Secretary of Defense when directing changes to the DoD-funded national intelligence programs. Likewise, the Secretary of Defense consults with the DNI when directing changes to the military intelligence programs. DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 INTELLIGENCE 81 DEFENSE INTELLIGENCE The Department's intelligence effort serves two primary purposes. First, it assists the Secretary in discharging his responsibility to anticipate, prepare for, and direct military operations and, in the aftermath of those operations, provide support to other elements of the USG to manage the effects of those military operations. Second, DoD also assists the Director of National Intelligence in di scharging his responsibility to provide national intelligence to the President and Congress. Accordingly, the Department undertakes three types of intelligence activities: Activities that are uniquely associated with DoD's military missions or are fundamental to it. These include tactical human intelligence, intelligence preparation of the battlespace, advance force operations, counterintelligence activities by the Military Departments for force protection overseas, and surveillance and reconnaissance through technical means. These activities are typically funded in the MIP; Activities that may support either the Secretary or the DNI as they execute their missions. For example, these include high altitude airborne ISR (U2, Global Hawk systems) and imagery and signals intelligence in support of CBRNE render safe missions. Aspects of these activities may be funded in either the MIP or the NIP; and Activities that are uniquely associated with the national mission of the DNI or are fundamental to it and are executed by direction of DNI through agencies or personnel within DoD. They include counterterrorism activities executed by the National Counterterrorism Center, foreign signals intercept, foreign imagery collection and analysis, human source collection and analysis, and counterintelligence. On balance, the DoD intelligence effort is weighted toward the first two types of these activities. Within the Department of Defense, components with intelligence-related functions include: Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence; Defense Intelligence Agency; National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency; National Reconnaissance Office; National Security Agency; Service Intelligence Activities; U.S. Air Force Airmen from the 910th Security Forces Squadron out of Youngstown Air Reserve Base, Ohio, run past yellow smoke wearing their gasmasks during a simulated chemical attack during Air Mobility Command's Rodeo 2007 at Fort Lewis, WA.

Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence (USD(I)) USD(I) is the principal advisor to the Secretary regarding intelligence, counterintelligence, security, and other intelligence-related matters. This official also plays an important coordinating role in intelligence-related matters across military and national intelligence spheres. Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) DIA is a major producer and manager of foreign military intelligence, with military and civilian employees deployed worldwide. DIA provides military intelligence to warfighters, defense policymakers, and force planners in the Department and the IC, in support of U.S. military planning and operations and weapon systems acquisition. Funding for DIA is found in both the national and military intelligence programs. DIA responds to the needs of customers, from the President to the warfighter in the field. It covers all aspects of military intelligence requirements\u2014from highly complex missile trajectory data to biographical information on foreign military leaders. Its analysts are highly skilled, world-class intelligence professionals who provide tailored intelligence products in a complex environment using leading edge technology. These capabilities are enhanced by effective mission management and sustained by streamlined enterprise IT and enterprise management. FY 2009 investments emphasize DIA's six core mission areas: All-Source Analysis. DIA will: strengthen analysis of transnational issues including terrorism, weapons of mass destruction, and associated proliferation activities; strengthen standards for all-source analysis within the Defense Intelligence Analysis Program community; and, enhance chemical/biological warfare analysis; Persistent but flexible global overlay of Human Intelligence (HUMINT). DIA will: align HUMINT capabilities to maximize collection against hard targets and imminent and emerging threats; sustain advanced HUMINT training; improve counterterrorism analytic support to field collection elements; and enhance training for embassy-based collectors; Measurement and Signature Intelligence (MASINT). DIA will continue to provide the centralized management for all national and DoD MASINT activities and will strengthen MASINT's contribution to intrusive, persistent surveillance capabilities; Mission Management. DIA will lead the IC by integrating intelligence, operations, and plans to operationalize intelligence. For example, the Defense Intelligence Operations Coordination Center integrates the Defense Joint Intelligence Operations Center and the Joint Functional Component Command for ISR to develop more agile and responsive intelligence operations across the national-to- tactical intelligence enterprise; Enterprise Information Technology. DIA will improve efforts to streamline information technology and data sharing capabilities and implement commercial information management practices; and Enterprise Management. DIA will continue to provide its workforce with the resources, facilities, and infrastructure necessary to accomplish their mission, including foreign language training and professional education. DIA will continue to improve its strategic human capital management to recruit, train, and retain an innovative and results-focused workforce. DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 INTELLIGENCE 83 National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) NGA's mission is to deliver timely, accurate, and actionable geospatial intelligence across the Department, other elements of the IC, and civil agencies. NGA provides its customers the ability to geospatially orient and visualize their mission environments by recording, manipulating, integrating, analyzing, and making available data from a range of sources. MIP resources enable NGA to support defense intelligence through improved tasking, collection, processing, exploitation, and dissemination of geospatial data - to provide DoD mission partners the most comprehensive and effective Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT) possible. NGA's funding strategy advances the Department's goals by making critical investments in integrated and persistent GEOINT systems and analysis. National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) The NRO is a joint organization engaged in the research and development, acquisition, launch and operation of space-based reconnaissance systems necessary to meet the needs of the IC and DoD. National Security Agency (NSA) NSA provides signals intelligence for a decisive information advantage for policy-makers and warfighters; facilitates network warfare operations; and delivers responsive, reliable, effective, and expert Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) and Information Assurance services. NSA's funding strategy for the NIP focuses on three interdependent areas: Sustaining current operations in the face of a dramatically increased and constantly evolving operations tempo; Modernizing the agency's information technology and physical plant infrastructures to assure robust support; and Transforming the cryptologic enterprise to keep pace with rapid technological advances. NSA is pursuing three main mission imperatives: Ensuring effective and actionable SIGINT support to military operations, including OIF and OEF; Providing enhanced or new capabilities to exploit hard targets and to provide global intelligence sensing capabilities; and Enhancing analytic tradecraft and operational infrastructure needed to provide information on and respond to threats to the U.S. and its Allies.

U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Davis Anderson - August 2007 DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 INTELLIGENCE 84 In the past, NSA and the Military Services have operated independently to develop intelligence capabilities. Today, cooperation and synchronization across the enterprise are essential. Accordingly, NSA is partnering with the Services to fuse SIGINT with other \"INTs\" and open source data to provide the most comprehensive view of the military battlespace. NSA is also continuing its efforts to establish a unified cryptologic community with the Services, creating a fully capable, mobile component of a single, global, integrated cryptologic system. To realize this vision, FY 2009 MIP investments are focused in three areas: Connect - fully integrate the Services into the SIGINT production chain; Equip - ensure the provision of the most effective equipment, doctrine, and training to the Services; and Enable - expand Services' role in the cryptologic environment to improve their ability to detect, attribute, and respond to unauthorized incursions into the Nation's critical networks. Service Intelligence Activities The U.S. Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force intelligence elements aim to: Provide commanders and decision makers accurate, tailored, timely, mission-essential intelligence that provides a high level of situational understanding; Establish an \"unblinking eye\" over the battlespace through persistent surveillance; and Meet the critical information needs of decision makers, Allies, and combatant forces. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) SOCOM's intelligence effort is focused on providing timely intelligence support to tactical operations. This includes investments in, contractor maintenance of, and logistic support for unmanned vehicles. These provide SOF reconnaissance, surveillance, target acquisition, battle damage assessment, intelligence collection, and other beyond visual line of sight mission requirements. Counterintelligence Field Activity (CIFA) CIFA's mission is to develop and manage DoD counterintelligence programs and functions that transcend command, Service, and agency organizational boundaries. CIFA provides the Department the capability to coordinate efforts to counter clandestine or covert threats to DoD personnel, operations, and facilities and to protect selected, high priority DoD research and technology undertakings and critical infrastructures. CIFA is responsible for integrating NIP (via the DoD Foreign Counterintelligence Program) and MIP resources to accomplish national and defense counterintelligence missions. CIFA developed a performance-based counterintelligence strategy and implementing plans that link to the National Counterintelligence Strategy, National Intelligence Strategy and the National Security Strategy. SUMMARY Members of the IC provide critical support to the warfighter and inform senior leaders as they make national security decisions. IC elements provide specialized and complementary capabilities, and funding ensures they are able to sustain baseline operations and respond to new and evolving demands. HEALTHCARE AND WOUNDED WARRIOR DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 HEALTHCARE AND WOUNDED WARRIOR 85 OVERVIEW The Military Health System (MHS) consists of the medical services of the Army, Navy (including the Marine Corps) and Air Force, the TRICARE Management Activity, and the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs. The MHS provides healthcare services to approximately 9.2 million eligible beneficiaries - Active Duty, Reserve and National Guard Soldiers, Sailors, Marines, Airmen, and their family members, plus military retirees and their family members (Figure 3.1). The MHS strives to be a world-class healthcare system that supports military missions by fostering, protecting, sustaining, and restoring health. The Department's FY 2009 request includes $41.6 billion to that end. CURRENT ISSUES IN HEALTHCARE The MHS is committed to providing a fit and protected force, optimal deployable medicine, satisfied beneficiaries, healthy communities, and a world-class health benefit, while controlling costs to the Department (Figure 3.2). The Department is particularly focused on ensuring wounded warriors are receiving the best care, treatment, and support while they recover, rehabilitate, and reintegrate. Achieving these goals, while keeping Department spending on healthcare manageable, is a challenging endeavor due to stress on the medical force to support continuing operations, a growing and aging patient population, and higher than anticipated medical cost growth.

Sustaining the Military Healthcare Benefit The Department's healthcare costs are rising rapidly and they consume an increasingly larger share of its budget. The Defense Health Program (DHP) - a separate Defense appropriation that funds the cost of TRICARE health benefits and many of the Department's other healthcare activities - grew by 97 percent between FY 1999 and FY 2007, a 10.2 percent annual increase. Primarily, this has been driven by expanded TRICARE benefits and the attractiveness of TRICARE's extremely low out-of-pocket costs for working-age retirees. TRICARE has continually improv ed its service over the past several years, and independent surveys show that as a health plan, it ranks as one of the Nation's best. Unique benefits include a national network of more than 220,000 physicians, access to all U.S. hospitals, a mail order pharmacy, and 55,000 retail pharmacies that supplement the Department's military medical facilities. The MHS has one of the best electronic health record systems in the world. Regardless of these advances, individual cost shares for TRICARE (annual fees and deductibles) have remained essentially the same since 1995. TRICARE Prime Family Enrollment Fee has remained constant at $460, the Prime Outpatient Visit Cost Share constant at $12, and the Standard Deductible constant at $300. As a result, the Department pays a continually increasing percentage of its beneficiaries' health costs. In 1995, beneficiaries paid approximately 27 percent of their healthcare costs. Today they pay only 12 percent. As premiums for employer-sponsored plans continue to rise, military retirees are increasingly electing to use the attractive TRICARE health benefit instead of the health insurance options provided by their employers (Figure 3.3). With the many benefit enhancements, increased beneficiary use, stable cost shares, and high healthcare inflation, the Department's total health costs - the Defense Health Program plus medical military personnel, medical military construction, and actuarial normal cost contributions to the Medicare Eligible Retiree Health Care Fund - have more than doubled in five years. Costs have increased from $19 billion in 2001 to $38 billion in 2006, and now represent 8 percent of the Defense budget. Trend analysis projects that these costs will reach $64 billion by 2015, which would be 11.3 percent of the anticipated Department budget, if no changes are made to the current fee and benefit structure. Over time, such cost growth may diminish the health benefit and impact Defense capabilities and national security (Figure 3.4).

DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 HEALTHCARE AND WOUNDED WARRIOR 87 To help sustain a superior military health benefit and to ensure necessary support for future national security missions, the Department endorses the recommendations of the Congressionally mandated Task Force on the Future of Military Health Care to adjust TRICARE cost shares. These adjustments would help realign the government and individual cost shares to begin to approach the 1995 cost share levels. Even with adjustments, the TRICARE benefit would remain a comprehensive health plan with smaller cost shares than those for the Federal Employees Health Benefit Program and nearly all other health benefit plans in the U.S. Notably, only the retail pharmacy adjustments would have a minimal effect on Active Duty family members. There would be no change for Active Duty members themselves. The FY 2009 budget request assumes savings of $1.2 billion from the implementation of increased TRICARE premiums and co-pays for working-age military retirees and their families. Supporting Wounded Warriors The MHS has demonstrated outstanding success managing injuries on the battlefield and preparing wounded service members to live productive lives. However, much remains to be done to help America's injured warriors return to full duty or to move on to the next phase of their lives. The MHS is working closely with the Veterans Administration, improving case management and access to medical information, which enables patients to play a bigger role in treatment no matter where it takes place. MHS members are wo rking to specifically improve diagnosis and compassionate care for traumatic brain injury (TBI) and post-traumatic Benefits 106-12 Source: Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health AffairsMilitary Retirees are Increasingly Using Spending 106-18 Source: Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health AffairsAnnual Defense Health Expenditures $ in Billions 1 2 1 2If recent trends continue, Health Spending will reach $64 billion, or 11.3% of the Department's top line in 2015 If Health Spending is managed to 8% of the Department's top line (FY06 level), it will reach $46 billion in 2015Cumulative Difference = $72B DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 HEALTHCARE AND WOUNDED WARRIOR 88 signature illnesses of the GWOT have created significant challenges in providing responsive, coordinated, patient- centered healthcare. The MHS is working to overcome these challenges and to develop more effective therapies, leveraging research within the Department, at other Federal agencies, including the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and at national healthcare research institutions. To ensure the Department's efforts in this area are integrated, implemented, coordinated and resourced, the Wounded, Ill and Injured Senior Oversight Committee (WII SOC) was established. WII SOC will streamline, de-conflict, and expedite the Department's efforts to improve the provision of medical care, disability processing and transition activities to the Department of Veterans Affairs for all military personnel. The committee is chaired by the Deputy Secretaries of Defense and VA and includes senior civilian and military leadership from both departments. The Department has begun and will continue to take action on the recommendations set forth in the President's Commission on Care for America's Returning Wounded Warriors (Dole/Shalala) report including steps to: Enhance case management. The Department seeks to provide an integrated continuum of case/care management that includes world-class quality care and service delivery for wounded, ill, and injured Service members and their families from recovery and rehabilitation to reintegration into society. The Department will develop and implement a Federal Individual Recovery Plan (FIRP) for each injured warrior, a resource directory, and training for Federal Recovery Coordinators; Restructure Disability and Compensation Systems. To improve and streamline the dis ability evaluation system, the Department will institute a single, comprehensive medical exam for each wounded Service member. Based on this exam, the Military Services would determine fitness for continued active duty service and VA would determine the disability rating for potential benefits. WII SOC is also working on a document management system and DoD interfaces with existing info rmation management systems on both the DoD and VA side; U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Greg Mitchell - October 2007Air Force Capt.

The Department is working to provide Service members with lifelong standardized and comprehensive screening, diagnosis, and care for all levels of TBI and PTSD, in conjunction with education for leadership, patient, and family members; Improve Department of Defense/Veterans Affairs Data Sharing. The Department will develop a user-friendly, tailored services and benefits portal for Service members, veterans, and their family members. The portal will display customized benefit information based on each user's profile, leverage existing web-based sites, and be a \"one stop shop\" for the injured warrior on all available Federal benefits. The Department will also work to transmit electronic digital radiographs and scanned medical records from DoD medical centers to VA Polytrauma Centers; and Standardize Facilities. The WII SOC has approved housing standards for all facilities used to house wounded warriors. Currently, the Department is conducting inspections of existing facilities and each will be standardized. Military-to-Civilian Conversions The Department initiated conversion of military-to-civilian personnel within the DHP for those military authorizations or billets that were identified as not essential to support the readiness or warfighting requirements of the Department. These converted authorizations will be filled by civilians and will result in improved overall cost e fficiency. DHP conversions are intended to reduce costs without harming operational readiness or access to quality healthcare (Figure 3.5). The Medical Readiness Review (MRR) commenced in 2004 to examine the military medical force structure and to set the foundation for future military-to-civilian conversion initiatives.

The FY 2009 request includes 2,036 military-to-civilian conversions for military billets that support the DHP. The FY 2007 National Defense Authorization Act required certification by the Secretaries of the Military Departments that the conversions would not increase costs or decrease access to or quality of care. The Military Department Secretaries have already certified that all or part of the planned FY 2007 and 2008 conversions are executable without compromising cost, quality, or access. The Department continues to refine the conversion process by reviewing and improving civilian personnel recruitment and retention strategies and allowing greater flexibility in the use of contractors when suitable civilian candidates cannot be found. Restricting or prohibiting medical military-to-civilian conversions will harm healthcare by inhibiting the MHS' ability to select the most qualified and cost-effective candidates for its work force. DOD HEALTHCARE PRIORITIES MHS operates according to six strategic priorities that guide its ability to respond to these current issues in healthcare and have influenced the Department's FY 2009 budget request: Enhance deployable medical capability, medical readiness of the force, and homeland defense by reducing the time from \"bench to battlefield\" for more effective mission-focused products, processes, and services. The needs of Commanders and Service members will be anticipated and a rapid response with innovative solutions will be provided. New opportunities will be identified and high performance services and products provided. Focus will be on coordination of research and development infrastructure to rapidly design, develop, and deploy \"bench to battlefield\" solutions for the warfighter; Sustain the military health benefit through top quality patient- centered care and long-term patient partnerships with a focus on prevention. The MHS will improve the integration of all parts of clinical practice, while empowering patients and families, relieving acute suffering, and promoting long-term wellness. This focus on prevention and disease management will extend to healthcare support contractors that partner in providing and arranging healthcare. Military medical practice and procedures, including the physical layout of facilities, will support healthcare that is compassionate, comprehensive, confidential, coordinated, and under the patients' control; Provide globally accessible, real time, health information. The Armed Forces Health Longitudinal Technology Application (AHLTA) is the patients' electronic health record and has been implemented in all military hospitals, medical clinics and dental clinics, and many deployed field units. Effective use of AHLTA will lead to more accurate diagnoses, fewer mistakes, and greater patient satisfaction. The data stored in AHLTA enables disease surveillance and true force health protection. Groundbreaking technologies like the Joint Trauma Registry and Theater Management Information Program are improving combat medicine and providing the capability to track casualties from initial injury to definitive treatment. All patient data, which previously never left the war zone hospital where it was documented, will be available to military healthcare providers worldwide; Provide incentives to achieve quality in everything the MHS does. The MHS is committed to a culture of continuous improvement that reduces exce ssive rules while promoting customer-focused, front-line innovation. The goal is to transition to performance based management for both force health protection and delivery of the healthcare benefit. DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 HEALTHCARE AND WOUNDED WARRIOR 91 Performance -based incentive systems and accountability processes that guide and control operations will replace regulatory-based controls; Unleash the potential of the MHS' people. The people of the MHS value the opportunity to serve the warfighter, do meaningful work, and make a difference. They are the key to system-wide success and the organization's most valuable asset. The MHS is working hard to improve joint leadership training and to develop common curricula via a shared campus at the Military Education and Training Center. Coordinated programs to improve recruiting and retention for the total Active Duty, Reserve, and National Guard military force are being implemented. Training at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences and other sites has resulted in combat theater hospitals working more jointly than ever before and medical professionals who have the capabilities to best support the warfighters; and Build and sustain the best hospitals and clinics and nurture a caring environment. Implementation of BRAC actions, particularly in the National Capital Region and San Antonio markets, offer opportunities to create state-of-the-art hospitals, where Army, Navy, and Air Force professionals work shoulder-to-shoulder caring for patients, educating medical leaders, and conducting ground-breaking research that meets patient needs. To achieve those goals, the MHS is streamlining administration, becoming more joint, and aligning authority with accountability. FY 2009 BUDGET REQUEST The Department's total request for healthcare - referred to as the Unified Medical Budget above - is $41.6 billion. The Defense Health Program (DHP), the largest segment with $23.6 billion in the FY 2009 President's Budget, includes: $23.1 billion for Operation and Maintenance, which funds most day-to-day operational costs of healthcare activities; $0.2 billion for Research, Development, Test and Evaluation, which funds healthcare-related information management and information technology development, Small Business Innovative Research, In-House Laboratory Independent Research, and the Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute; and $0.3 billion for Procurement, which funds equipment or systems with a unit cost of $250,000 or more. This includes equipment for outfitting of new, expanded, or refurbished healthcare facilities, modernization and replacement of equipment past its useful life, and automation equipment for central purchase of information systems. The DHP Operation and Maintenance request includes: In-House Care ($6.5 billion) - medical and dental care and pharmaceuticals provided in the Department's medical and dental treatment facilities; Private Sector Care ($12.1 billion) - similar services from private sector providers; Consolidated Health Support ($1.3 billion) - readiness and military unique functions including Armed Forces examination and entrance stations, aeromedical evacuation, and certain contingency operations costs; Information Management ($1.1 billion) - Central Information Management/Information Technology program management, system and infrastructure sustainment, software licensing and equipment lease costs, and specific military medical service and TRICARE Management Activity functional area applications; DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 HEALTHCARE AND WOUNDED WARRIOR 92 Management Activities ($0.3 billion) - C2 activities of the MHS, including the Army Medical Command, the Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery, Surgeons' Offices of Air Force Major Commands, and the TRICARE Management Activity; Education and Training ($0.5 billion) - scholarship and financial assistance programs, the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sc iences; and military medical service health training activities, such as specialized skill training and professional development programs; and Base Operations and Communications ($1.2 billion) - costs of operating and maintaining certain installations and facilities. Military Personnel and Construction Funding for military medical personnel and certain deployable healthcare activities is included in the budget requests of the Military Departments. More than 150,000 military and civilian medical personnel provide healthcare services when deployed in military theaters of operations and in fixed healthcare facilities around the world, including 63 inpatient medical facilities and more than 800 medical and dental clinics. They conduct global aeromedical evacuation, perform shipboard and undersea medicine, deliver humanitarian assistance, and respond to medical crises around the world. The Department conducts ground-breaking healthcare research, developing new technologies that save lives on the modern battlefield and advancing treatment protocols for TBI, PTSD, and a wide variety of diseases that pose significant threats to military operations. DoD Medicare-Eligible Retiree Health Care Fund The DoD Medicare-Eligible Retiree Health Care Fund (MERHCF) was established in FY 2003 to pay the Department's healthcare costs for Medicare-eligible military retirees, retiree family members, and survivors. MERHCF operations are overseen by the DoD Medicare-Eligible Retiree Health Care Board of Actuaries, appointed by the Secretary of Defense. An actuarial estimate of the \"normal cost\" contribution for all military members that is made into the MERHCF each year to pay for their healthcare once they retire from the military and they, their family members, or their surviv ors become eligible for Medicare. Estimated FY 2008 MERHCF distributions to DoD include $7.9 billion to the DHP to provide healthcare in military treatment DoD photo by: Air Force Tech.

The FY 2009 estimate is $9.0 billion. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS The FY 2009 DHP request includes $0.6 billion for the revised TRICARE Reserve Select program, which came into effect on October 1, 2007. This program offers healthcare coverage to the Reserve Component, which is comparable to the TRICARE Standard option that is available to Active Duty family members, retirees, and their family members. The MHS continues to plan, prepare, and protect against the potential pandemic influenza outbreak, and the FY 2009 budget request includes $0.1 billion for pandemic influenza requirements for vaccination, treatment, and surveillance activities. In the event of a pandemic influenza outbreak, the Department's mission is to preserve combat capabilities and readiness and to support Federal efforts to save lives, reduce human suffering, and slow the spread of infection. In FY 2009, the Department will seek funding to continue the new Warrior Care Support Program, now operating in TRICARE's North Region (Rosslyn, Virginia), which provides wounded Service members with one point of contact and minimizes the stress of obtaining and managing healthcare for beneficiaries and their families. The program identifies eligible severely ill or injured Service members through military treatment facility referrals, health records identification, or Service member requests. When a Service member is accepted into the program, a healthcare coordinator from a team of nurses, doctors, and administrative staff will assist with a timely and seamless transition and coordination of physical and behavioral healthcare services from the military treatment facility U.S. Air Force Lt.

In addition to coordinating care, the team assists the warrior and family members by educating them on healthcare choices, providing resources, and assisting with claims resolutions and authorizations for medical equipment. SUMMARY The MHS augments the care that is available from military treatment facilities through the TRICARE health benefit. TRICARE provides eligible beneficiaries with access to a global network of private-sector healthcare providers, hospitals, and pharmacies. The MHS exists to provide a fit and protected force, optimal deployable medicine, satisfied beneficiaries, healthy communities, and a world-class health benefit at a reasonable cost to the Department. Significant risks to these goals include stress on the medical force to support continuing operations, a growing and aging patient population, and higher-than-anticipated medical cost growth. In addition, the MHS must help America's injured warriors return to full duty or move on to the next phase of their lives. DoD is working closely with the Department of Veterans Affairs to improve case management and access to medical information. Their goal is to enable patients to play a larger role in their own treatment\u2014no matter where it takes place. MHS staff members are working to improve diagnosis and compassionate care for traumatic brain injury and post traumatic stress disorder. Overall, the MHS is endeavoring to develop more effective therapies by leveraging research at DoD activities, other Federal agencies\u2014including the Department of Veterans Affairs\u2014national healthcare research institutions, and industry. Throughout all of its endeavors, the MHS seeks increased efficiency and effectiveness from such joint medical services as contracting, logist ics, human capital, information technology, and facility management. The MHS is like no other health system. Its people\u2014the military doctors, nurses, and technicians \u2014 are driven by a dedication to medicine and country. The MHS is a different kind of medicine, nursing, and public health. Every day the MHS delivers good medicine in bad places. For these services, there is no civilian comparison. COMBATANT COMMANDS DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 COMBATANT COMMANDS 95 OVERVIEW The FY 2009 budget request includes $8.6 billion for Combatant Commands (COCOMs) to: Sustain current operations and missions, as well as amounts for new, emerging missions, such as the European Command (EUCOM) North Atlantic Treaty Organization Special Operations Forces Coordination Center; Continue the stand-up and fund the operational costs of the newly established Africa Command (AFRICOM); Fund specific COCOM building partnership capacity initiatives, such as Southern Command's (SOUTHCOM) Developing Countries Combined Exercise program; Fund the Department's overarching combined exercise program for all COCOMs; Support the further expansion of interagency coordination and integration in the COCOM headquarters; Improve Pacific Command's (PACOM) interoperability and communications with coalition partners; and Support Strategic Command's (STRATCOM) expansion of its Combating WMD mission and its cyber and space operations. To improve COCOM resource visibility, in part in response to Congressional interest, the FY 2009 budget request includes an Operation & Maintenance (O&M) budget for COCOM resources. Although COCOM funding, with the exception of Special Operations Command, is embedded in the Military Services requests, the new O&M special activities group is an important step to increase transparency and facilitate an understanding of COCOM resourcing.

Africa was seen by some in the past as a problem to be solved - a continent of failed states, faltering economies, regional conflicts, and weak leadership. Working closely with the international community and Allies in Africa, we have made important progress promot ing democratic access and accountability, improving economic opportunity, and building sustainable African security capacities. The credit for this progress goes to the African people who, with the support of international partners, are slowly but surely instituting democracy and good governance across the continent, enabling more people to enjoy the benefits of freedom and security, choice, and opportunity. Without doubt, challenges remain. Poverty, disease, and conflict persist. Corruption flourishes where the rule of law is weak. Gaps in infrastructure, technology, and legal protections discourage local and foreign investment. The U.S. is helping African nations develop the capacity to address these challenges. Strengthening the U.S. Relationship with Africans Security cooperation is one aspect of U.S. collaboration with Africa, but only a small part of the overall relationship. Security assistance includes joint training exercises to improve the level of professionalization and technical proficiency in African militaries across the continent, as well as to instill respect for human rights, the rule of law, and the proper role of a civilian controlled military in a democracy. The U.S. provides equipment and funds to meet African defense and security needs; established the Africa Center for Strategic Studies in Washington, DC to promote a continuous dialogue between African military and civilian leaders, and their U.S. counterparts; and instituted the Regional Disaster Management Center of Excellence in Nairobi to enhance African abilities to respond to natural or manmade disasters. The U.S. is now taking this relationship a step further. In February 2007, the President announced his decision to create a Unified Command for Africa AFRICOM. Although this structure is new, U.S. military engagement on the African continent will remain focused primarily on building partnership capacities, conducting theater security cooperation, building important U.S. Navy Adm.

For many years, U.S. military re lationships on the continent have been managed by three separate commands (Figure 3.6): EUCOM, CENTCOM, and PACOM. AFRICOM will allow the Department's civilian and military leaders to take a holistic and operationally efficient approach to the opportunities and challenges in future African security affairs. Rationale for AFRICOM's Creation A stable, healthy, more prosperous Africa will contribute to global security and a stronger world economy. Many of Africa's security challenges are not limited by country boundaries but are transnational and regional in nature. African governments and institutions are using new approaches to address these challenges, and the U.S. approach to engagement in Africa must also evolve. AFRICOM is the logical next step in a course set almost a decade ago as the U.S. began to increase its emphasis on supporting trade, development, and health initiatives on the continent. U.S. health and development programs for Africa currently total nearly $9 billio n and include major initiatives such as the Millennium Challe nge Account, the African Growth and Opportunity Act, the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, and the President's recent initiative to combat malaria. 106-100Figure 3.6 U.S. Geographic Combatant Commands - NORTHCOM EUCOM PACOM CENTCOMAFRICOM Geographic CommandsShared responsibilities AFRICOM & CENTCOM DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 COMBATANT COMMANDS 98 In contrast, U.S. security assistance programs on the continent amount to no more than $250 million annually, only 1/36th of the resources provided for non-security related programs. Despite newspaper headlines and uninformed rhetoric to the contrary, trade, health, development, and governance issues and programs - not military programs - dominate U.S. policy toward Africa today and will continue to do so in the future. The creation of a DoD command for Africa will in no way change this U.S. policy focus. AFRICOM's Innovations AFRICOM is an innovative command in several ways. First, unlike a traditional Combatant Command, it will focus on building regional security and crisis response capacity. AFRICOM will promote greater security ties between the U.S. and Africa, provide new opportunities to enhance bi-lateral military relationships, and strengthen the capacities of Africa's regional and sub-regional organizations. Second, AFRICOM will include a significant number of representatives from other U.S. agencies within its staff, including officers from the Department of State and the USAID. These interagency officers will contribute their knowledge and expertise to the command so that AFRICOM will be more effective as it plans for security capacity initiatives, humanitarian relief, and disaster response capacity in Africa, in support of U. S. foreign policy. Third, AFRICOM's focus is on war-prevention rather than war- fighting, theater security cooperation activities, and preventing the escalation of problems or crises. Myths versus Reality There are a number of misconceptions about what AFRICOM will look like and what it will do. First, some believe that the DoD is establishing AFRICOM solely to fight terrorism, or to secure oil resources, or to discourage China. These beliefs are false. While violent extremism is cause for concern, and must be addressed, it this is not AFRICOM's singular mission. Natural resources represent Africa's current and future wealth, but in a fair market environment, many will benefit. With regard to China, the U.S., China, and other countries have a common interest in a secure environment. AFRICOM is about helping Africans build greater capacity to assure their own security. Second, some have raised the concern that AFRICOM will take control of security issues on the continent. The intent of the Department is quite the contrary. DoD recognizes and applauds the leadership role that individual African nations and multi-lateral African organizations are taking in the promotion of peace, security and stability on the continent. For example, U.S. Navy Ensign Chris Hutchinson poses with a group of children after a soccer match in Conakry, Guinea, hosted by the Guinean navy for the Sailors of the guided-missile frigate USS Doyle (FFG 39). Doyle was visiting the Western African nation to support theater security cooperation and maritime operations in the region. U.S. Navy photo by Lt. Cmdr. Corey Barker - June 2007 DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 COMBATANT COMMANDS 99 AFRICOM can provide effective training, advisory and technical support to the development of the African Standby Force. This is exactly the type of initiative and leadership needed to address the diverse and unpredictable global security challenges the world currently faces. Third, there are fears that AFRICOM represents a militarization of U.S. foreign policy in Africa and that AFRICOM will somehow become the lead USG interlocutor with Africa. This fear is unfounded. AFRICOM, just like EUCOM, CENTCOM, and PACOM today, is firmly committed to maintaining its focus on security engagement and cooperation, but is a key supporting organization in the implementation of U.S. foreign policy as articulated by the Secretary of State. The creation of a single U.S. DoD point of contact for Africa will simply allow for the better synchronization and coordination of DoD efforts to help build security capacity in Africa, and with Department of State and USAID efforts to improve governance and development capacity and opportunities. AFRICOM will act as a facilitating mechanism for the important humanitarian work being carried out by these agencies, as well as by local and international NGOs. DoD will not be the lead U.S. agency for those efforts, and AFRICOM will not seek to encroach on the humanitarian efforts of NGOs. AFRICOM FY 2009 Budget Request The establishment of AFRICOM, and the participation of the Department of State, USAID, and other U.S. agencies, demonstrates the importance the USG places on strengthening ties with Africa. Once AFRICOM becomes fully operational in October 2008, the U.S. will be working in partnership with African governments, institutions, and organizations to foster an environment of security and peac e - an environment that will enable Africans themselves to further strengthen their democracies, institutionalize respect for human rights, pursue economic prosperity, and build effective regional institutions. A more stable Africa serves the goal of a more stable global environment.

BUILDING PARTNERSHIP CAPACITY DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 BUILDING PARTNERSHIP CAPACITY 101 \"Arguably the most important military component in the War on Terror is not the fighting we do ourselves, but how well we enable and empower our partners to defend and govern their own countries. The standing up and mentoring of indigenous armies and police -- once the province of Special Forces -- is now a key mission for the military as a whole.\" Secretary Robert Gates OVERVIEW The U.S. has historically underinvested in building the capacity of foreign partners to conduct operations with or instead of U.S. forces. In an era in which many threats emanate from countries with whom the U.S. is not at war, this need becomes even more acute. Rather than ignoring problems or taking action on foreign soil, building capacity of our partners to address their own threats provides an alternativ e that solves problems early, minimizes direct U.S. engagement, and over time builds a cooperative capability of like-minded forces that can mitigate potential instability and terrorism, reducing the long-term risk of costly military deployments. As Secretary Gates has said, working by, through, and with partners - once an activity ancillary to our national security -- is now arguably the most important military component of the GWOT. The Department began correcting this underinvestment with a comprehensive request in FY 2008 to improve USG tools to perform these tasks and continues this effort with a $0.8 billion request for Building Partnership Capacity (BPC). Building foreign partner capacity is critical because: It can reduce stress on U.S. forces, both by sharing today's burdens and by helping partners to solve problems before they become crises that require major U.S. military interventions in the future; The U.S. does not have sufficient forces to deny terrorists sanctuary everywhere in the world and must rely on partners, who often have shared interests but lack capacity, to manage their own security problems; Combined efforts with Allies are often more effective than unilateral action - it takes networks to defeat networks; If properly trained and equipped, foreign forces can often be more effective than U.S. forces on the ground because they know the language, culture, and political terrain; Large U.S. military footprints abroad can be used by the enemy as a recruiting tool. Capable foreign forces can alleviate requirements for large U.S. military footprints; The U.S. is at peace with many countries where terrorists enjoy sanctuary and exploit ungoverned spaces. The U.S. must work through these countries to help reduce terrorist Building Partnership Capacity $ in Billions Global Train and Equip1,20.3 0.5 0.5 Security and Stabilization Assistance10.1 0.2 0.2 Combatant Commanders' Initiative Funding for Urgent Humanitarian Relief and Reconstruction requirements 0.1 0.1 Total Building Partnership Capacity 0.4 0.0 0.8 0.8 Numbers may not add due to rounding Notes: 1Funds for FY 2007 were reprogrammed. 2 FY 2008 funds were requested in the base but $0.3 billion were appropirated in the supplemental.FY 2007 Actual FY Enacted FY 2009 RequestPercent Change '08-'09Delta '08-'09 DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 BUILDING PARTNERSHIP CAPACITY 102 safe havens, capability, and influence on their soil and waters; and It bolsters soft power approaches that emphasize setting conditions and building goodwill - giving U.S. forces tools other than bullets, thereby reducing risk to life and limb. With these considerations in mind, the Departments of Defense and State conducted a systematic review of gaps in existing authorities and resources to achieve these ends. The review led to the development of an omnibus request for changes to authority called the Building Global Partnerships Act (BGPA), which the Administration submitted to Congress as part of its request for the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). To incorporate lessons learned in FY 2008 and new needs identified by commanders in the field, the Department will submit an updated Partnership Act for FY 2009. The resources for BPC requested in the FY 2009 President's Budget reflect the funds that Combatant Commanders and Ambassadors need to execute this mission and make these authorities operative in a meaningful way. Among their needs, key funding priorities include: Global Train and Equip Authority (FY 2006 NDAA Section 1206) to build partner nation security capacity ($0.5 billion); Security and Stabilization Assistance (FY 2006 NDAA Section 1207) to facilitate whole-of-government responses and provide civilian agencies with tools to facilitate the non- military elements of stabilization missions ($0.2 billion); and The Combatant Commanders' Initiative Fund to allow Commanders to meet unanticipated humanitarian relief and reconstruction requirements ($0.1 billion). GLOBAL TRAIN AND EQUIP Global Train and Equip programs allow Combatant Commanders and Ambassadors, working together, to train and equip foreign military forces in response to urgent and emergent threats and opportunities, solving problems before they become crises that require significant military interventions. The geographic Combatant Commanders consider global train and equip authority the Department's single most important tool for building partner operational capacity, shaping the environment, and countering terrorism outside Iraq and Afghanistan. The annual demand from Combatant Commanders and Ambassadors for train and equip funds has significantly U.S. military personnel from Combined Joint Task Force - Horn of Africa and French Foreign Legion servicemembersconduct equipment familiarization at Camp Lemonier, Djibouti, prior to a parachute jump to ensure interoperability between the two forces. U.S. Navy photo by Chief Mass Communication Specialist Philip A. Fortnam - March 2007 DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 BUILDING PARTNERSHIP CAPACITY 103 exceeded current authority. In fact, over the past two years, Combatant Commanders have submitted more than $1.6 billion of proposals. While the Global Train and Equip authority has been in effect less than three years, it has rapidly become the gold standard for interagency cooperation to meet emerging threats and opportunities because of the revolutionary way it is managed. Beneficial program characteristics include: Speed and Prevention. Traditional security assistance takes three to four years from concept to execution. Global Train and Equip authority allows a response to urgent and emergent threats or opportunities in six months or less. Early successes included: - Augmenting Pakistani air assault capability, enabling a rapid response to a resurgent Taliban threat and resulting in an increased operations tempo and capture and kill rates; and - Rapidly moving vehicle spare parts, ammunition, and other basic supplies to the Lebanese Armed Forces to assist in establishing a stronger stabilizing presence throughout the country. Rigor. Thorough vetting of submissions results in strategically sound choices with a high national security return on investment. Proposals for Global Train and Equip funds are scored by SOCOM, the Joint Staff, Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA), the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, and separately by numerous Department of State components, with independent review by regional, functional, and programmatic experts. Both Departments of Defense and State must agree explicitly before any program can go forward. Planning requirements also far exceed those for comparable programs. Combatant Commands and Embassies must lay out detailed proposals that are assessed on the full range of issues that impact program success, including operations and maintenance plans, absorptive capacity and executability, adherence to broad foreign policy objectives, military feasibility, integration with other USG efforts, and mitigation of human rights concerns. Leveraging the range of core competencies resident in U.S. Departments and Agencies results in the selection of proposals the need for which is strategically clear. Targeted National Security Investments. Under traditional security assistance programs, most countries get roughly equivalent levels of assistance year after year, independent of new needs or changes in the strategic environment. Moreover, recipient countries have significant say in what they purchase with the money. With Global Train and Equip programs, countries must compete for funds yearly for projects that support shared security goals. There is no \"fair share\" each year, nor entitle ment that any Embassy or Command will receive funding from one year to the next. Also, each proposal is generated by an Ambassador or Combatant Commander, ensuring that the projects meets a U.S. requirement, rather than partner-nation wish list. Dual-Key Authority. DoD and Department of State coordinate on all security cooperation activities, but the Global Train and Equip authority takes cooperation to a new level. It encourages joint formulation of programs between embassies and Combatant Commands, and both must approve each program explicitly in writing. This brings the best competencies of both departments to bear, including the diplomacy that is required to achieve buy-in from foreign partners. DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 BUILDING PARTNERSHIP CAPACITY 104 The Department will continue to build on the success of this program in several ways. Metrics are under development to measure operational and strategic effects. DoD has asked the Inspector General to do a three-year systemic review of Global Train and Equip programs and to make its own recommendations to improve program performance. When operations tempo allows, the Department will use U.S. forces to conduct and supervise training in order to improve the quality of training and build military-to-military relationships. Finally, the Department will integrate partners into combined exercise programs to periodically test their capabilities and assess how well they are maintained or improved over time. SECURITY AND STABILIZATION ASSISTANCE Recent experience has made clear that many of our challenges do not have purely military solutions; foreign partners also require non-military assistance to promote stability or reduce terrorist space and influence. The Security and Stabilization Assistance authority (\"Section 1207\" authority) allows DoD to transfer funds to the Department of State to help meet this need. This program allows DoD and State, working together, to facilitate whole-of-government solutions to complex security challenges. By bringing civilian stabilization and reconstruction tools to bear in situations where U.S. forces might otherwise be forced to assume the burden, this program reduces strain on U.S. forces. To date, this authority has been used to provide innovative security and stabilization projects in Haiti, Somalia, Nepal, Colombia, Trans Saharan Africa, Yemen, and Southeast Asia. Projects have been used to provide assistance to foreign police forces; to improve governance, rule of law, economic development, or essential services; and for humanitarian assistance. For example, in the Haiti Stabilization Initiative, DoD supported this innovative State program in Cite Soleil, Port au Prince's largest slum, providing $20 million to combine community policing with small-scale employment and infrastructure projects to improve security and stability and bolster the reach of central authorities. Positive reaction of the populace within the project area has reinforced efforts of peacekeeping forces to wrest control from rapacious gangs and reinforced legitimacy of government authority. In FY 2007, DoD and State piloted a few small focused activities in various critical countries/regions to demonstrate proof of concept. While they have been largely successful, most could have more significant impact if continued or expanded. The demand in critical regions is much greater than these pilot projects support. For example, tripling the resources to expand the Haiti Stabilization initiative in FY 2008 to Gonaives and Cap Haitien would maximize that program's effectiveness. DoD is also seeking a change to legislation to allow transfers of funds, at the request and with the concurrence of the Secretary of State, to other USG departments and agencies, making 1207 a true whole- of-government mechanism. Finally, 1207 complements the State Department's Civilian Stabilization Initiative (CSI), which will establish a corps of trained civilian experts to respond to stabilization missions, by provid ing a source of funding for programs developed, coordinated with DoD, and overseen by civilians available for deployment through CSI. To meet these program needs and expansion to a wider set of government entities, for FY 2009, DoD seeks to expand this program to $0.2 billion, and a corresponding increase in authority. Like Global Train and Equip authority, these programs are developed under \"dual key\" procedures, producing programs that have demonstrable benefit in areas where the Combatant Commands are operating. In the future, DoD and State may consider synergies between these authorities, where security capacity provided using Global Train and Equip funding could be augmented by non-military measures to improve the underlying sources of instability. DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 BUILDING PARTNERSHIP CAPACITY 105 COMBATANT COMMANDERS' INITIATIVE FUND Combatant Commanders outside of CENTCOM have requested an authority similar to the Commander's Emergency Response Program (CERP), which that has been enormously successful in Iraq and Afghanistan. To meet this need, Congress granted DoD a similar authority in the FY 2007 NDAA (Section 902) by expanding authorized uses of the Combatant Commanders Initiative Fund (CCIF). Like CERP, CCIF provides commanders with funds for urgent relief and reconstruction in their areas of responsibility. The operational tool allows commanders to shape the local environment and counter ideological support for terrorism by building goodwill, lessening potential requirements for military force, and enhances prospects for mission success in other regions of the world. Conferees noted the importance of providing Combatant Commanders with additional authority, resources, and flexibility to respond to urgent and unanticipated humanitarian relief and reconstruction needs in their area of responsibility (AORs), particularly in countries where U.S. forces are engaged in a contingency operation. In the past, CCIF has served as a small account used to fund up to $25 million annually in priority projects identified by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. With this change, CCIF can also be used to fund urgent Humanitarian Relief and Reconstruction Assistance globally. In the NDAA conference report, the conferees \"urged the Department of Defense to request sufficient funds in the CCIF for this purpose in future years budget requests\" and to \"develop guidance for the use of this authority to ensure that the authority can be used quickly and without bureaucratic delay in urgent situations.\" The Department will develop guidance for the use of this expanded authority globally to ensure responsiveness to Commanders' needs. ADDITIONAL BUILDING PARTNERSHIP CAPACITY EFFORTS The Department also executes a number of additional programs critical to improving engagement and for ensuring the long-term sustainability of our capacity building initiatives. For example, the Department seeks increases in funding and authority for its fellowship programs and the Regional Centers for Security Studies. These programs create the strategic-level human and The Military Sealift Command hospital ship USNS Comfort (T-AH 20) arrives at Naval Station Norfolk, VA., after a four-month humanitarian deployment to 12 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean.

Kretschmer - October 2007 DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 BUILDING PARTNERSHIP CAPACITY 106 institutional capacity required to sustain U.S. investments in training and equipment, and they build networks of like-minded security experts to combat global threats. Expanded Regional Center funding will sustain the FY 2008 investment Congress made in the Centers and enhance their ability to develop human capital and conduct strategic outreach. The Department is also seeking funding and authority to establish a Defense Coalition Support Account. This account would allow the Department to maintain an inventory of items commonly needed by our partners (such as night vision devices, communication equipment, and body armor) or to expedite the award of contracts to procure such equipment so it will be readily available when it is required for transfer to coalition partners. Advance purchases will focus on high-demand warfighter support equipment that has long procurement lead times. Long procurement lead times are often the main limiting factor in our ability to provide coalition partners with critical equipment to make them operationally effective. This account has been identified by the Department as a useful tool that could help speed the provision of necessary equipment to Iraq - a matter of Congressional interest this year - but could also speed the provision of equipment to other partners, increasing the U.S.' ability to respond rapidly to emerging threats or opportunities worldwide. Funding in FY 2009 would help capitalize the account, which would ultimately operate as a self-sustaining revolving fund. Other capacity building initiatives do not require dedicated funding lines, but amend laws to streamline or improve the capabilities of our Combatant Commanders and others to engage effectively abroad. Cumulatively, these efforts will fill gaps needed to build the capacity of our partners, ultimately solving problems before they become crises requiring military forces. The Department has conducted 19 major stabilization and reconstruction operations since the end of the Cold War, but the outdated tools to act to avoid these, or to operate effectively with partners during them, do not provide enough flexibility or responsiveness to execute today's missions effectively. Providing tools to meet today's missions is critical to setting the U.S. on the right long-term security footing for future contingencies and future Administrations - beyond Iraq and Afghanistan. These efforts have the unequivocal support of all Combatant Commanders, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Secretary of Defense, and the Secretary of State. NATIONAL GUARD AND RESERVE DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 NATIONAL GUARD AND RESERVE 107 OVERVIEW The Department's FY 2009 budget request supports the Reserve Components (RC) of the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force and their continued transition from a strategic to a more operationally employed reserve. Like the Active Components (AC), National Guard and Reserve units and individual members are heavily utilized across the full spectrum of current operations, ranging from combat missions in support of the GWOT to homeland emergencies. The budget request includes $49.1 billion to fund pay and allowances to support Reserve Component training, incentives, equipment operation and maintenance costs, and readiness training costs for eligible military personnel. This amount includes $9.0 billion for Reserve Component equipment procurement, which is funded by the Military Departments as a subset of their Active Component procurement budget. The FY 2009 budget request supports the Department's Ready Reserve, which totals 1.1 million members and contributes about 44 percent of the total military end strength at a cost of about 9.5 percent of the total base budget. The Ready Reserve consists of the Selected Reserve (about 838,000), the Individual Ready Reserve (IRR) (about 250,000), and the Inactive National Guard (ING) (about 2,000). The FY 2009 budget request funds Ready National Guard and Reserve $ in Billions Army Reserve 8.0 8.1 8.9 +0.8 9.7% Navy Reserve 3.6 3.4 3.7 +0.3 9.6% Marine Corps Reserve 1.2 1.0 1.1 +0.0 4.3% Air Force Reserve 4.7 4.8 5.3 +0.5 10.2% Army National Guard 18.3 18.7 19.8 +1.1 5.7% Air National Guard 9.4 10.2 10.3 +0.1 0.9% Total National Guard and Reserve 45.0 46.3 49.1 +2.8 6.0% Military Strength (in 2008 Marine Corps Reserve 38.6 Air Force Reserve 71.1 67.5 67.4 '08-'09 Numbers may not add due to roundingFY 2007 Actual DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 NATIONAL GUARD AND RESERVE 108 Reserve training and support, with the emphasis on the Selected Reserve. There are two other Reserve categories, the Standby Reserve (about 20,000) and Retired Reserve (about 650,000), are not funded on an ongoing basis and can only be activated under a Full Mobilization requiring a formal Declaration of War by Congress. Transition to an Operational Reserve Since 2001, Reserve Components have been transitioning to an Operational Reserve. As an Operational Reserve, the RC will operate across the continuum of military missions, performing both strategic and operational roles in peacetime, wartime, contingency, domestic emergencies, and homeland defense operations. Previously, the RC had typically played a strategic role, which meant that they were held in reserve for use during a major war and were not normally deployed for daily operations. As an Operational Reserve, the Services organize, resource, equip, train, and utilize their Guard and Reserve components to support mission requirements to the same standards as their Active Components, although they are generally equipped and resourced to meet a lower level of readiness when not mobilized. Each Service's force generation plan prepares both units and individuals to participate in missions across the full spectrum of military operations, in a cyclic or periodic manner that provides predictability for the COCOMs, Services, Service members, their families, and civilian employers. This budget request supports a National Guard and Reserve that has both strategic and operational roles and is as accessible as needed to meet the National Military Strategy. Portions of the RCs still serve as a strategic hedge, such as the Individual Ready Reserve and certain hardware units, but others are integrated into day-to-day military operations and participate at a higher level in operational missions than ever before. Figure 3.7 illustrates the increased man-days the RC has historically contributed to the Total Force effort. Prior to September 11, 2001, RC members could expect to be mobilized once or twice in their career and train 39 days a year. Today, all RCs are moving towards a more rotational process, characterized by a period of active service followed by an extended period at home. In January 2007, the Secretary of Defense mandated that involuntary mobilizations be limited to no more than 12 months, which might not include individual skill training days required for mobilizat ion or deployment or terminal leave. The Secretary of Defense also set a goal of not more than one year mobilized in any six year period for the Reserve components. The Services are moving toward this goal as 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07Figure 3.7 Total Reserve Component Force Contribution 106-09 Source: Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Reserve Affairs Note: Data Shows \"Direct Support\" Only, Not \"Indirect Support\" (e.g., Recruiting, USPFO, Most AGR Support).

Unlike before, when the RCs were usually funded at less than full readiness because they were not first to fight, specific units now must be fully resourced in any given year. This new train- mobilize-deploy construct means that the RCs must be manned, equipped, trained, and ready when their scheduled availability comes up, and they must be funded accordingly. Training and Resourcing an Operational Reserve The ongoing shift to an Operational Reserve affects training schedules and funding requirements. In the past, normal training consisted of about two days per month plus 14-15 days of active duty for training annually, during which time RC personnel were required to train to the same standards as their Active counterparts. While that training profile remains for some units, those with planned deployments (particularly land-based components in the Army and Marine Corps) undergo increased training days prior to mobilizati on. With more training pre- deployment and less post-deployment, this new profile minimizes mobilized time away from families and civilian jobs. This new profile will also require a different resourcing approach. Funds which had been consumed after mobilization from the Active accounts are now required and expended prior to mobilization from the Reserve a ccounts. This significant change in training profiles means that a simplistic comparison to prior year execution funding models can be very misleading. To resource an operational reserve, the FY 2009 budget seeks modest end strength growth for the Army Reserve Components to support the Defense Strategy and Army requirements, while Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force remain fairly level in size. The Department requests a continuation of Congress' traditionally strong support to adequately compensate members of the RCs through a 3.4 percent pay raise and funds for strong recruiting and retention programs. The FY 2009 budget also supports the Department's continuing efforts to rebalance skills within and across all components to minimize stress on the force. Following a highly beneficial two-year pilot program and with Congressional support, the RC FY 2009 budget requests for Military Personnel are being submitted using a consolidated U.S. Army Cpl.

The updated single total is titled \"Reserve Component Training and Support\" and synchronizes the budget submission with Congressionally approved execution, which facilitates analysis and supports transformation to an Operational Reserve force. Equipping and Basing an Operational Reserve The Department continues to ensure that deployed and next-to- deploy units, whether in the Active or Reserve Component, receive the highest equipping priority. Effective and realistic readiness training at home requires that the National Guard and Reserve have access to equipment compatible with the Active components and used in the assigned operational environment. For FY 2009, force structure and new mission assignments are changing equipping requirements. Modernizations, mission transformation, equipment replacement due to the war losses, and homeland defense are catalysts for a new approach to equip the Reserve components. Equipment utilization will continue at a high rate for the foreseeable future, necessitating a higher percentage of available equipment than what was prescribed in the past. The FY 2009 budget requests $9.0 billion for RC equipment procurement. These funds are needed to repair and replace war-damaged equipment and to correct longstanding deficiencies. This request will not only improve combat readiness but will also allow the National Guard to further improve its ability to respond to local domestic emergencies. The Reserve components request $0.9 billion in FY 2009 for 58 Military Construction (MILCON) projects. The Army National Guard and the Army Reserve account for over 88 percent of the funds requested for RC MILCON and over 83 percent of the number of RC MILCON projects. These projects will meet both current and new mission requirements for RC operation, readiness, and training facilities and include 15 Army Reserve Centers, 12 Army National Guard Readiness Centers, eight weapons qualification training range projects, three aviation maintenance support facilities, five operations facilities, and three Air National Guard projects to meet new Air Force Total Force Integration (TFI) missions. During FY 2009, the Department will continue to implement decisions approved through the BRAC 2005 process. With the closure and consolidation of selected facilities around the country, the RCs will achieve savings by co-locating many units into new Joint (Multi-Component) Armed Forces Reserve Centers. Homeland Defense and Civil Support Events of recent years - from terrorist attacks to domestic emergencies, such as Hurricane Katrina - have shown that civil authorities continue to rely upon the Department for support in times of crisis. As locally based, community-oriented units with a presence in every State, territory, and region, the National Guard and Reserve are uniquely positioned to play a large role in local Homeland Defense and Civil Support missions. The Department continues to work with the Department of Homeland Security, other Federal agencies, various State Governors, and others to define specific military requirements. The budget request funds Civil Support Teams across the nation, as well as CBRNE Enhanced Force Package activities in selected localities. The Army and Air National Guard specifically have dual mission responsibilities \u2014 1) a Federal national defense mission under the President, and 2) a State mission during which they are under control of the Governor. While National Guard members are being trained and equipped to undertake Federal Active service, they are paid from Defense Department appropriations; for State missions, they are paid from State funds, although they can sometimes be Federally funded or reimbursed from Defense Department appropriations if approved by the Secretary of DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 NATIONAL GUARD AND RESERVE 111 Defense. Acting in their State capacity, qualified National Guard members may perform specific law enforcement functions which they are restricted from performing when serving in an active Federal status. Given this additional flexibility while in State status, it may be advantageous for the National Guard to be under State control in certain circumstances, such as the aftermath of a natural disaster like Hurricane Katrina or for assistance in southwest border patrol. Employer Support The Department shares members of the National Guard and Reserve with civilian employers. These employers contribute significantly as enablers of the Nation's defense when their serving employees are called to active military service. The Department's National Committee for Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve (ESGR) works closely with Reservists, employers, and other USG entities to inform and educate all parties of their legal obligations under the Uniformed Services Employment and Re-employment Rights Act. ESGR's chartered mission is to gain and maintain employer support for Guard and Reserve service by recognizing outstanding support, increasing awareness of the law, and resolving conflicts through informal mediation. The FY 2009 budget provides for a community-based national network of 56 State, district, and territory Field Committees consisting of over 4,500 volunteers. These volunteers and a small headquarters staff support a comprehensive outreach effort to the approximately 125,000 employers of Reserve component members of the Selected Reserve. Additionally, about 900 trained ESGR Ombudsmen mediate workplace challenges and disputes between Service members and their employers to further ensure continued support for the all-volunteer force.

Graham - August 2007 DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 NATIONAL GUARD AND RESERVE 112 Civil Military Programs The FY 2009 budget continues to support the Department's Civil Military Programs, including National Guard Youth Challenge, Science and Technology Academies Reinforcing Basic Aviation and Space Exploration (STARBASE), and Innovative Readiness Training (IRT). The Challenge Program is designed to enable selected young adults to attain a high school diploma or GED and to develop as future leaders using a military training model that teaches leadership skills. STARBASE is aimed at encouraging science and mathematics interest in grades K-12 by direct exposure to scientific examples and applications. Both Challenge and STARBASE often utilize existing National Guard and Reserve military facilities for training. The IRT program allows National Guard and Reserve members on duty to accomplish military readiness training, while also providing tangible benefits to America's underserved communities. An example is the work by RC engineers and builders gaining and polishing their skills while constructing a road serving remote Americans in parts of Alaska.

USMC CYBERSPACE INITIATIVES DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 CYBERSPACE INITIATIVES 113 Cyberspace Initiatives OVERVIEW The Department relies on global information infrastructures for mission success. Mission essential functions, emergency services, and critical infrastructures depend on the uninterrupted use of the Internet and trusted communications systems, data, and control systems that comprise our cyber infrastructure. National security depends on the availability and trustworthiness of a shared critical information infrastructure. A variety of sophisticated adversaries threaten the security of the cyber infrastructure - terrorists, hostile foreign governments, criminal hackers, and the insider, and the Intelligence Community has shown intent and willingness of our adversaries to target our cyber capabilities. Acknowledging that a major cyber attack would be debilitating to U.S. security and the economy, the President set forth guidance critical to national defense in the 2003 National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace. The strategy was developed in close collaboration with key private sectors as the first step in a long-term effort to secure our information infrastructure and avoid a \"Cyber 9/11\" against our nation. The three strategic objectives outlined in the strategy are: Prevent cyber attacks against Amer ica's critical infrastructures; Reduce national vulnerability to cyber attacks; and Minimize damage and recovery time from cyber attacks that do occur. THE DEPARTMENT'S ROLE The Department has a crucial role in defending its own networks within the Global Information Grid (GIG) and in assisting the Federal government with defense of the U.S. networked critical infrastructure. Accordingly, the Department developed the National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations (NMS-CO) to secure cyberspace and guide all military operations in this new warfighting domain. The NMS-CO is the comprehensive strategy for U.S. Armed Forces to ensure U.S. military superiority in cyberspace. The NMS-CO set forth a military strategic framework that orients and focuses DoD action in the areas of military, intelligence, and business operations in and through cyberspace. The NMS-CO identified four strategic priorities to focus DoD efforts to help translate the strategy into action: Gain and maintain the initiative to operate within the adversary decision cycle; Integrate capabilities across the full range of military operations using cyberspace; Build capacity (i.e. personnel, training, and infrastructure) to conduct cyberspace operations; and Manage risk for cyberspace operations. Each of the Services, Commands and DoD Agencies in the Department are critical to U.S. success in cyberspace. This success is predicated on being able to understand and respond to the threat, reduce vulnerabilities, and investigate cyber incidents. Each have assigned missi ons to increase security and improve the Department's collective situational awareness. These efforts are expanding to support national focus on cyber threats and an increasing mission set. Moreover, because cyber threats are not unique to the DoD, the Department must be ready to share its technology, knowledge and experiences with others in the Federal Government. The National Security Agency/Central Security Service, Strategic Command, and the Defense Information Systems DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 CYBERSPACE INITIATIVES 114 Agency have key roles because of their missions, authorities, expertise and capabilities. In 2007, the Air Force stood up a provisional Air Force Cyberspace Command, which will reach full operational capability in FY 2009. The primary mission of this new command is to integrate its global kinetic and non-kinetic strike capability and to organize, train, and equip to ensure the full spectrum of integrated global effects in cyberspace. The Army Network Enterprise Technology Command (NETCOM) ensures centralized network monitoring and security management. In 2007, NETCOM leveraged the Army's event correlation tool to maintain an enterprise management capability of ov er 600,000 IT assets. The Naval Network Warfare Command (NETWARCOM) integrates the Navy's protection, monitoring, detection, analysis, and response of security situational awareness for operations at both afloat/shore installations. In 2007, NETWARCOM continued to deploy DoD standardized automated secure configuration compliance, verification, and remediation capabilities throughout the Navy and Marine Corps infrastructure. COMPREHENSIVE NATIONAL CYBERSECURITY INITIATIVE The Administration established the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative in 2007 to address the growing threats to USG information systems. In particular, the Federal government must greatly reduce the risk associated with its unclassified networks. Spearheaded by DHS, the initiative seeks to improve the security of all Federal networks through the coordinated efforts of multiple departments and agencies. These efforts involve both technical solutions and policy changes; for example, the Federal government must increase its ability to share threat and vulnerability data with those who should analyze and act on it. To support the initiative, the FY 2009 budget increases funding for selected cyber security activities. The Department will play a critical role in this initiative through enhancing the security and Defense networks and by supporting other Departments and Agencies as necessary. SUMMARY The real threat of cyber attack has spurred the NMS-CO, focused attention on cyber security throughout the Department, and engaged the interagency through the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative. Each effort calls resources and attention to focus on the fight in cyberspace. These efforts will further strengthen protection of DoD critical systems and networks as well as to begin fulfilling its National Security roles in aiding the other Federal agencies protect against cyber attacks. Sustained funding will be needed to man, train, and equip cyber forces of the future.

Lantron - July 2007 PRESIDENT'S MANAGEMENT AGENDA DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 PRESIDENT'S MANAGEMENT AGENDA 115 President's Management Agenda The President has called for a government that focuses on priorities and executes them well. Securing the homeland, waging war on terror abroad, and revitalizing the economy are some of the Administration's most important priorities, but even these will not be addressed by si mply devoting money to them. The assumption that more government spending gets more results is not generally true and is seldom tested. It is potentially wrong for two reasons. First, the program may not actually achieve the results everyone expects. Second, it ignores the fact that improvements in the management of programs can produce results for less money by realizing the same productivity gains commonly expected in the private sector. By focusing on performance, we can achieve desired results at limited additional cost or, in some cases, a reduction in spending. We can and should get more for less. The President's Management Agenda (PMA) is an aggressive strategy for improving the management of the Federal government. The PMA provides the managerial and operational discipline that leads to better results and attainment of goals, both internally and externally. The President's Management Agenda includes five government-wide initiatives: Strategic Management of Human Capital; Competitive Sourcing; Improved Financial Performance; Electronic Government (e-Gov); and Performance Improvement. In addition, the President's Management Agenda includes four program initiatives that apply to the Department: Cost of War Reporting; Eliminating Improper Payments Initiative; Privatization of Military Housing; and Real Property Management Initiative. The President's Management Agenda was designed to \"address the most apparent deficiencies where the opportunity to improve performance is the greatest.\" It focuses on remedies to problems generally agreed to be serious and commits to implement them fully. Federal departments and agencies are evaluated and expected to: 1) define measurable results, 2) monitor the progress in achieving those results, and 3) make management and resource decisions based on such progress. Each Quarter, the departments and agencies receive \"stoplight\" grades of green, yellow, or red from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) on both their current status and progress toward meeting the standards for success established for each performance initiative. Although the Department's grades were mixed as of September 30, 2007 (Figure 3.8), DoD has made significant progress since PMA's implementation in 2002. \"Government likes to begin things\u2014to declare grand new programs and causes and nati onal objectives. But good beginnings are not the measure of success. What matters in the end is completion. Performance. Results. Not just making promises, but making good on pr omises. In my Administration, that will be the standard from the farthest regional office of government to the highest office of the land.\" President George W. Bush DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 PRESIDENT'S MANAGEMENT AGENDA 116 GOVERNMENT-WIDE INITIATIVES Strategic Management of Human Capital Goal: To maintain a competent, motivated, and mission-ready workforce to support and respond to emerging threats, now and in the future. Taking care of people, building and sustaining a high performing organization, and positioning the Department's Human Resources (HR) systems for 21st century challenges are critical elements of the Department's human capital strategy. The Department's objective is to focus on initiatives and programs that ensure that the military components and activities can recruit and maintain high-performing employees who have the right skills and are employed at the right time to fulfill DoD's national security mission. The Department is optimizing its core mission and critical support occupations by analyzing its workforce, identifying trends and competency gaps, and relying on hiring and compensation flexibilities to fill those gaps. As part of its recruitment strategy, the Department is aggressively targeting individuals who have needed skills by using career patterns for select mission critical occupations and maximizing hiring and compensation flexibilities. Addi tionally, the Department is continuing its marketing campaign that showcases the DoD as an employer of choice. Efforts to target the best and brightest potential employees include approaching Wounded Warriors by conducting, in conjunction with partners at the Department of Labor, Veterans' Affairs, and the Office of Personnel Management, career fairs and of fering on-site employment assistance at medical facilities. The 2006 QDR called for a transformation of the workforce into one that is more agile and flexible to meet the challenges of the 21st century. To this end, the Department is building an agile Figure 3.8 President's Management Agenda Scorecard Results 106-10Source: Executive Branch Management Scorecard, www.results.govReal Property Management InitiativeProgress Score Privatization of Military HousingEliminating Improper Payments InitiativeCost of ReportingProgram Initiatives:Performance ImprovementElectronic CapitalGovernment-wide Initiatives:Status ScoreInitiative Real Property Management InitiativeProgress Score Privatization of HousingEliminating Improper Payments InitiativeCost of ReportingProgram Initiatives:Performance ImprovementElectronic Human CapitalGovernment-wide Initiatives:Status ScoreInitiative * = Results as of September 30, 2007G= Success Y= Mixed Results R= Unsatisfactory = Change in score since FY 2005R Y R YG Y G Y R G R G Y R Y R Y G Y G Y G Y GR G R GY Y Y Y Y Y Y Y DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 PRESIDENT'S MANAGEMENT AGENDA 117 and capable civilian senior executive leadership cadre. To support this initiative, a DoD Directive was published titled \"Career Lifecycle Management of t he Senior Executive Services Leaders within the Department of Defense.\" The Directive establishes DoD policy to institute a deliberate, systematic, and predictable approach in the management of the career lifecycle of DoD Senior Executive Service leaders. This overall leadership framework is designed to produce world-class leaders with a joint perspective for executive positions throughout the Department. Additionally, the Department enhanced its Defense Leadership and Management Program as another means to ensure that future leaders obtain a well-rounded and joint perspective. The Department continues the implementation of the National Security Personnel System (NSPS). NSPS is a flexible and contemporary human resources management system that supports the Department's national security mission and allows civilian employees to be recognized and rewarded based on performance. The system is being implemented in successive spirals of designated categories of employees and organizational units. At the end of FY 2007, approximately 110,000 employees were covered by NSPS. Another 90,000 employees will be added during FY 2008. The FY 2007 Partnership for Public Service and the American University's Institute for the Study of Public Policy Implementation \"Results on the Best Places to Work\" support our finding in having a highly dedicated and motivated workforce. According to those results DoD ranked as the 13th Best Place to Work out of 30 large Federal agencies. In addition, the Department of the Army ranked 10th in the same survey, the Department of the Air Force ranked 11th, and the Department of the Navy ranked 19th. These results show that strong leadership, a great work environment, and commitment to mission are producing a satisfied workforce. Competitive Sourcing Goal: To help agencies become more results-oriented and effective through public-private competition subject to OMB Circular A-76, Performance of Commercial Activities. Competitive sourcing is a key PMA initiative focused on increasing public-private competition of commercial activities to improve quality, reduce cost, and provide rapid delivery of better products and services. Competitive sourcing under A-76 procedures has demonstrated substantial savings regardless of whether the government or contractor is selected as the service provider. The public-private competition process has been used by the Department for over 50 y ears to make effective business and management decisions. Public-private competitions save taxpayers an average of 35 percent of operating costs. Numerous studies by the Government Accountability Office and the DoD Inspector General verify that these savings are real. From FY 2000 through FY 2007, DoD completed approximately 899 competitions with about 91,780 civilian/military positions. These competitions will generate over $8.8 billion in savings (cost avoidance) over the life of the contracts, normally about five years. An additional 6,287 positions were announced during FY 2007, but competition is not yet complete. The Department plans on announcing an additional 6,116 positions for competition by the end of FY 2008. Public-private competitions apply procedures from the Federal Acquisition Regulation in conjunction with OMB Circular A-76, which requires a single-source selection evaluation process for private sector offers and the government. The Department enforces performance either by contract or by letters of obligation with the Most Efficient Organization (as required by the Circular). Competitions are typically completed in approximately 12 months, which allows both DoD employees and private sector competitors to plan and makes funds available for other priorities. DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 PRESIDENT'S MANAGEMENT AGENDA 118 Improved Financial Performance Goal: To ensure transparency over the Department's finances\u2014 having timely and reliable financial information to make informed decisions about agency or program management. Transparency means knowing the costs and results of the Department's programs and operations and being able to judge the best return on investment. In 2005, the Department undertook an extensive effort to modernize and improve its business and financial operations and to prepare the Department for an independent audit. Under the leadership of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller), the Defense Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR) Plan was developed and implemented and is producing significant results. Since the first FIAR Plan was introduced for Quarter 1 FY 2006, the Department has established a system of detailed accountability, accelerated integration of business transformation initiatives and systems, and prioritized efforts in areas where they will have the most impact. These three cornerstones of our effort - Accountability, Integration, and Prioritization - continue to drive the Department's work today. See the Financial Management Accomplishments chapter for more information. Major FY 2007 accomplishments include: Seven Defense-reporting entities have received an unqualified audit opinion on their FY 2006 financial statements: Defense Commissary Agency, Defense Contract Audit Agency, Defense Finance and Accounting Service, Defense Threat Reduction Agency, Military Retirement Fund, Office of the DoD Inspector General, and the Chemical Biological Defense Program. Medicare-Eligible Retiree Health Care Fund received a qualified audit opinion, and three DoD-wide financial statement line items have received favorable audit reviews. The Defense Logistics Agency's contingent legal liabilities have been examined and verified as \"audit ready\" by the DoD Inspector General, and the Defense Information Systems Agency is ready to assert that their FY 2007 Balance Sheet is ready for audit. Several large business segments are undergoing an independent examination to confirm audit readiness: Navy Nuclear and Conventional Ships Environmental Liabilities, and Air Force Appropriations Received, Net Transfers, and Fund Balance with Treasury. The Department has enabled 75 percent of its legacy accounting systems to be compliant with the Standard Financial Information Structure (SFIS) for financial reporting. By March 31, 2008, 100 percent of DoD's legacy systems are expected to be SFIS compliant. The Department recently updated its audit strategy from a focus on line-items to business processes or segments. The Department described the revised audit strategy in the updated FIAR Plans as of June 2007 and September 2007. An update on implementation of the revised audit strategy will be provided in the next FIAR Plan update in March 2008. DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 PRESIDENT'S MANAGEMENT AGENDA 119 Electronic Government (E-Gov) Goal: To ensure that the Federal Government's $60 billion annual investment in information technology (IT) is well spent. Each agency is working to ensure that all major IT investments are justified with strong business cases; all projects are completed within 10 percent of cost, schedule, and performance goals; and IT systems are properly secured and data is protected appropriately. At the same time, agencies are tasked to work collectively to achiev e an effective government that is more citizen-friendly. The Department takes an active role in several government-wide initiatives that support E-Gov including SmartBUY, the Integrated Acquisition Environment, and various education and training initiatives. DoD Enterprise Software Initiative Support to SmartBUY The DoD Enterprise Software Initiative (ESI) team partnered with General Services Administration (GSA) SmartBUY to establish Enterprise Software Agreements for data-at-rest (DAR) encryption products from 10 commercial software publishers at discounted prices and with advantageous terms and conditions. These co-branded SmartBUY/ESI agreements allow State and local governments to purchase DAR encryption products under the same discount schedule as Federal government customers. This enhances protection of critical infrastructure while sharing Federal digital data with State and local governments. Additional co-branded SmartBUY/ESI agreements were established for information technology asset management products and services and for supply chain management software. The Department administers co-branded SmartBUY/ESI agreements for 18 commercial software publishers on behalf of the entire Federal government, NATO, authorized defense contractors, and (in some cases) State and local governments. Integrated Acquisition Environment The DoD Defense Procurement and Acquisition Policy (DPAP) office in conjunction with the Business Transformation Agency (BTA) leads department-wide implementation of the Integrated Acquisition Environment (IAE) portfolio of capabilities. IAE supports procurement and acquisition processes throughout the government. Ongoing implementation supports both Federal and DoD goals of strategic, timely, and cost-effective acquisition, delivery of the best possible goods and services to the warfighter, and the unification and simplification of the acquisition business environment to support this delivery. This year, the Department transitioned its contracting reporting offices to reporting directly to the new Federal Procurement Data System - Next Generation (FPDS-NG) and is working with the GSA to improve ongoing reporting capabilities. This brings the government closer to its goal of having good management information with which to make key acquisition decisions. Other accomplishments include improving the capabilities of and initiating Department-wide testing and training on the electronic Subcontractor Reporting System and adding the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation supplement clauses to the Online Representations and Certifications system to enable full deployment within the Department. This and other improvements facilitated by the IAE portfolio of capabilities streamline the procurement process for both the government and the vendors with whom we do business. Education and Training Initiatives The Department is beginning the second year of implementation of the Information Assurance Workforce Improvement Program (IA WIP), a workforce management and certification program which applies to all IA personnel. This program establishes technical and administrative training requirements; identifies specific commercial certifications applicable to the Department's DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 PRESIDENT'S MANAGEMENT AGENDA 120 IA workforce; and requires that specific tracking and reporting capabilities be developed to support certification and recertification efforts. Per the IA WIP implementation plan, the Department certified 10 percent of its IA workforces in calendar year (CY) 2007 and plans to certify an additional 30 percent in CY 2008. The Department established an IT Project Management Certificate program at the Information Resources Management College of the National Defense University. This certificate focuses on project leadership skills, IT program/project management concepts and methods, and IT issues and recent developments. Students learn IT project management policies, regulations, theories, and concepts; how to apply best practices using several actual examples and case studies; and how to use state-of-the-art project management automated tools. Between the program's inception in October 2006 and the end of FY 2007, student enrollment has grown from 56 to 210. Four students have completed the six-course program. The Department has issued an implementation policy for a department-wide IT Exchange Program (ITEP). The purpose of the ITEP, authorized by the E-Government Act of 2002, is to improve the competencies and skill s of exceptional individuals from both the public and private sectors. Organizations may participate in ITEP in three ways: 1) sending personnel \"outbound\" from their activity, 2) receiving \"inbound\" personnel into their organization from the private sector, or 3) participating in both the outbound and inbound aspects of the program. The ITEP project manager has actively promoted the program to DoD, industry and professional IT organizations and associations, and as a result, several DoD Components and potential private sector partners are considering implementing the program. The DoD Chief Information Officer's Congressional Liaison staff has been working with Congress to extend the ITEP beyond its original December 2007 \"sunset.\" The Department continues to expand the IT and IA education opportunities available through our Information Assurance Scholarship Program (IASP). In FY 2007, 74 students received scholarship funding. The IASP is used as a recruitment tool to award scholarships to rising college juniors and seniors and to graduate students to complete either a master's degree or PhD program. In exchange, these individuals are obligated to fill IT/IA vacancies within the Department. The IASP is also be used to enhance retention; for instance, current military and civilian DoD employees are eligible to receive funding for master's or PhD programs in exchange for continued service in critical IT/IA positions. The Department has awarded 161 recruitment scholarships and 95 retention scholarships since the program's inception in 2001.

DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 PRESIDENT'S MANAGEMENT AGENDA 121 Performance Improvement Goal: The PMA Budget and Performance Integration Initiative, subsequently renamed Performance Improvement Initiative (PII), calls for a Government that is results-oriented - guided not by process but guided by performance. The PII is focused on implementing the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) of 1993. Since the first quarter of FY 2003, the DoD has maintained a \"yellow\" rating for overall status for this initiative by meeting the following OMB scoring criteria: Senior agency managers meet at least quarterly to examine reports that integrate financial and performance information that cover some of the major responsibilities of the Department. Agency can demonstrate information is used to improve performance of agency programs; Strategic plans contain a limited number of outcome oriented goals and objectives. Annual budget and performance documents incorporate measures identified in the Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART) process; The full cost of achieving per formance goals is accurately reported in budget and performance documents; At least 50 percent of agency programs rated by the PART have at least one efficiency measure; and No more than 50 percent of agency programs receive a Results Not Demonstrated rating for two years in a row. For the last two quarters of FY 2007, the DoD has received a red rating for \"progress\". This is based on the Department's failure to: Brief PMA scorecards and PART initiatives to the Congress; Obtain the Deputy Secretary of Defense certification and approval of PART improvement plans; Provide examples of marginal costing; and Show progress in implementing acquisition reform. The Defense Department is taking positive steps to restore its PII \"progress\" rating from red to green. For FY 2009, a program/budget issue team, that included OMB participation, was formed to ensure enterprise-level performance targets are linked to the budget. As a result, performance assessment will be institutionalized as part of the DoD's annual program/budget review. In addition, the review generated examples of marginal costing that will be forwarded in DoD's next quart erly report. In FY 2009, the Department will be working to meet the following OMB criteria that are required to achieve a \"green\" status rating: Senior agency managers meet at least quarterly to examine reports that integrate financial and performance information that cover all major responsibilities of the Department. Agency works to improve program performance and efficiency each year; Agency can estimate the marginal cost of changing performance goals; Has at least one efficiency measure for all PARTed programs; Uses PART evaluations to direct program improvements and hold managers accountable for those improvements, and PART findings and performance information are used consistently to justify funding requests, management actions, and legislative proposals; and Implement acquisition reform initiatives to address General Accounting Office high risk problems. The Performance Improvement chapter provides detail on actual performance results for FY 2007 and targets for FY 2009. DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 PRESIDENT'S MANAGEMENT AGENDA 122 PROGRAM INITIATIVES Cost of War Report To deliver a standard GWOT Cost of War reporting process that is credible, transparent, timely, accurate, auditable, and meets accounting principles and standards. In FY 2007, the Department established a GWOT Senior Steering Group to improve the credibility, transparency, and timeliness of Cost of War reporting, consistent with accounting principles and standards. This governing body is comprised of senior financial leaders of the Services and Defense Agencies. Major FY 2007 Accomplishments: Chartered a GWOT Cost of War Project Management Office, developed an integrated project management plan, and executed actions in a timely manner, which resulted in major improvements to the GWOT Cost of War process. The success of the GWOT Cost of War efforts to date was recognized by OMB, which changed the Department's progress score from yellow to green; Reviewed, documented, and validated current funding, execution, and reporting processes and sources of GWOT Cost of War data, providing traceability and auditability of GWOT Cost of War obligations; Developed the first comprehensive GWOT status of funds report which displays funding, obligations, and disbursements, a significant im provement over the previous reporting process which only showed obligations; Improved financial management in theater by clarifying payment documentation requirements, by training units, and by transferring back-office functions to the Continental United States (CONUS), which relieves the warfighter of non-warfighting burdens; Reduced payments made in theater by transferring the payment processes of Central Billed Accounts and CONUS-based vendors; travel settlements and advances; and Voluntary Incentive Pay to CONUS. This reduced military manpower requirements; Developed and implemented GWOT Cost of War accuracy and compliance scorecard as part of a continuous improvement effort; Statistically sampled Cost of War operation and maintenance obligation sources and determined obligations were substantially accurate and certified; DoD photo by Staff Sgt. D. Myles Cullen, U.S. Air Force - February 2007Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates responds to a question during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing about the 2008 Defense Department budget at the Hart Senate Office Building in Washington, D.C. Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) and Chief Financial Officer Tina W. Jonas, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Marine Gen. Peter Pace joined Gates at the hearing. DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 PRESIDENT'S MANAGEMENT AGENDA 123 Identified and monitored over 200 GWOT Cost of War financially related audits; initiated open and continuous communication with the audit community; and mitigated potential audit findings by proactively seeking and ensuring implementation of corrective actions with the Services prior to the issuance of the final report. Examples include: 1) implemented revised fund distribution procedures, improving the ability to record and report GWOT Cost of War directly from the accounting systems; 2) improved documentation controls and clarified policy in a contingency operation; and 3) provided timely and accurate responses and supporting documentation in response to audit requests; and Delivered GWOT reports enabling the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) to cover operational needs pending enactment of the GWOT request. These reports were also the driver in focusing efforts to improve obligation rates in expiring accounts, which resulted in a 99.8 percent obligation rate at year end. During FY 2008, the Department continues to pursue continuous process improvements by: Developing and implementing standard Department-wide contingency reporting processes and procedures; Validating and tracing obligations to and from the GWOT Cost of War reports to source data and cost models; Providing more timely analyses of war costs and execution; Implementing more meaningful and user friendly GWOT Cost of War reports; and Continuing to partner with COCOMs to improve contingency finance and accounting functions.

DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 PRESIDENT'S MANAGEMENT AGENDA 124 Eliminating Improper Payments Goal: To strengthen financial management controls to better detect and prevent improper payments, thus enabling the DoD to better ensure the taxpayer dollar is put to the use the Congress intended. The Improper Payments Information Act of 2002 (IPIA) requires Federal agencies to review all programs and activities annually and to identify those that may be susceptible to significant erroneous payments (both $10 million and 2.5 percent of program payments). An improper payment occurs when the funds go to the wrong recipient, the recipient receives the incorrect amount of funds, or the recipient receives payment for an ineligible service. Improper payments include duplicate payments and payments for services not received. The Department aggressively minimized improper payments before IPIA existed, and the Department has remained below the OMB improper payment high-risk threshold since IPIA reporting requirements were instituted. Under 0.2 percent of the Department's total FY 2007 payments were erroneous, and approximately one-half of the total improper payments were underpayments. However, based on the large volume of transactions and high dollar amounts of some transactions, OMB or DoD deemed the following five programs reportable in the FY 2007 Agency Financial Report: 1) Military Health Benefits, 2) Military Pay, 3) Civilian Pay, 4) Military Retirement, and 5) Travel Pay. The Department also reports information on recovery audit efforts for commercial payments. Major FY 2007 Accomplishments: Disclosed available data for all improper payments programs in the FY 2006 Performance and Accountability Report; Established DoD project officers for improper payments and recovery audits, who work closely with OMB and DoD Components to ensure continued reductions in improper payments and full compliance with IPIA requirements; Held a Department-wide conference to disseminate IPIA policy and guidance; Improved documentation of the current sampling plan and procedures for travel pay; Performed special reviews of Iraqi improper payments; and Accelerated the annual IPIA component survey to help ensure IPIA data reported in the FY 2007 Agency Financial Report is complete and current. During FY 2008, the Department continues pursuing improvements by: Reporting newly developed out-y ear improper payment reduction targets for the civilian pay and travel pay programs; Establishing an internal improper payment performance metric to allow management to closely monitor progress and take prompt corrective actions as needed; Developing a revised sampling plan to ensure complete reviews of travel pay populations; and Implementing a Business Activity Monitoring tool to identify problem commercial transactions - facilitating improper payment reporting, corrective actions and reductions, and recoveries. DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 PRESIDENT'S MANAGEMENT AGENDA 125 Privatization of Military Housing Goal: To eliminate inadequate family housing and increase the quality of life for Service members and their families. From 2001-2005, the Department received \"green\" scores for both status and progress on this initiative to eliminate inadequate family housing and increase the quality of life for Service members and their families. The Army, Navy, and Marine Corps met this PMA goal by eliminating all houses in the CONUS which they had determined to be inadequate to satisfy their housing requirements by the end of FY 2007. Inadequate housing is considered eliminated fr om the DoD inventory when it is privatized with a plan for revitalization and a committed income stream for the needed construction. The inadequacies of overseas units will be eliminated by FY 2009. Currently, the Air Force has 9,000 inadequate units in CONUS remaining to be privatized. The Air Force has sent four Congressional Notifications for privatization awards at six bases which will bring the total to 4,000 remaining inadequate units by the end of 2008. Accordingly, rather than awarding DoD green status and progress assessments, the Department received a yellow status and green progress assessment. Leveraging DoD's resources with private sector capital will revitalize inadequate housing faster and at a lower lifecycle cost to the taxpayer than traditional construction. Since 1996, DoD has privatized over 173,000 units and eliminated over 131,500 inadequate units via privatization. The Department has aggressively pursued the four ambitious goals it set for the end of 2007: Eliminate all inadequate domestic family housing units by the end of FY 2007 (92 percent completed); Privatize 80 percent of the domestic inventory by end of FY 2007 (accomplished); Cover 100 percent of average housing costs with the basic allowance for housing (accomplished); and Achieve an 80 percent customer satisfaction rating by the end of FY 2007 (accomplished). Real Property Management Goal: To help agencies efficiently manage the hundreds of billions of dollars in real property owned by the Federal Government. The Federal Real Property Council has developed standards for how Federal agencies can improve property management, including timely and accurate inventory data and performance measures in evaluating property acquisition, maintenance, and disposal decisions. Military Service members receive a Basic Allowance where they can choose to live in private sector housing, or privatized housing. Ft. Belvoir, VA, Privatized Military Housing DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 PRESIDENT'S MANAGEMENT AGENDA 126 The Department has developed and implemented a comprehensive plan to improve real property management with the ultimate goal of ensuring that the right assets are available when and where they are needed and with the capabilities necessary to support the warfighter. Accurately capturing the real property inventory and continuing to refine performance measures that monitor how well we sustain, restore and modernize our facilities are integral steps in accomplishing that goal. The Department's plan to monitor progress, identify and correct deficiencies, and address overall management of its real property includes the following: Increased visibility of assets through improved real property inventories and the development of a Department-wide net- centric data warehouse; Application of requirements models based on accurate and auditable commercial benchmarks and tied directly to existing and forecasted assets; Standardization of performance targets across DoD through improved planning guidance; Implementation of mechanisms for continuous tracking of performance through the programming and budgeting cycle; Controlling the size of the DoD footprint through management incentives and a robust demolition/disposal program, including Base Realignment and Closure decisions; An up-to-date asset management plan including goals and timelines; Achieving full sustainment funding levels to prevent deterioration and loss of service life; and Reaching a recapitalization rate that matches the expected service life of the assets under management, to prevent loss of effectiveness through obsolescence. To improve asset accountability, the Department has developed a real property unique identification concept. All assets have a DoD-wide unique identifier, allowing management and financial systems to better track environm ental, operational, and financial data. This concept is being reviewed by industry and other Federal agencies for use outside DoD. PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT 127 Performance Improvement Background The PMA Budget and Performance Integration Initiative, subsequently renamed Performance Improvement Initiative (PII), is focused on re-emphasizing and implementing all the statutory provisions of the GPRA of 1993. The PII calls for a Government that is results-oriented - guided by performance, not process. Since the first quarter of FY 2003, the Department has maintained a \"yellow\" rating for overall status of this initiative. DoD Performance Budget Hierarchy Sections 200-230 of OMB Circular A-11 characterizes a performance budget as a hierarchy of goals, structured like an agency's strategic plan. At the top of the pyramid is the agency's mission statement followed by strategic goals, or statements of aim or purpose, as outlined in the agency's strategic plan. For each strategic goal, there are a limited number of high priority strategic objectives that add greater specificity to the general goal in terms of outcomes to be achieved. For each strategic objective, there are a limited number of performance targets (measures and milestones) that are used to indicate progress toward accomplishing the objective. The Department's performance budget hierarchy is depicted in Figure 3.9. This hierarchy indicates that every level of the DoD is accountable for measuring performance and delivering results at multiple tiers of the organization. DoD investments in systems and other initiatives are aggregated to support strategic objectives at the enterprise or highest DoD echelon level. Performance accountability cascades to the appropriate management level (DoD Enterprise to DoD Component to individual personnel at the bottom of the pyramid) with performance targets advocated at all echelons. Primary responsibility for performance improvement in the DoD rests with the Deputy Secretary of Defense in his role as the Chief Management Officer. The Deputy Secretary is assisted by the Under Secretary of Defense for Comptroller who is his primary advisor on DoD performance information. The strategic objectives and performance outcomes discussed in this chapter were identified by Principal Staff Assistants (PSAs) within the Office of the Secretary of Defense and the Joint Staff as most relevant for joint or enterprise-level strategic focus and public dissemination. This list does not represent a comprehensive and exhaustive list of all DoD performance targets. The list does not include classified performance targets or address performance improvements associated with the NIP, since responsibility for the NIP fa lls under the purview of the DNI.

Such changes reflect the evolutionary nature of DoD's performance budget and the Department's continuing efforts to ensure resource allocation is linked to identifiable and measurable strategic outcomes. DoD Strategic Plan The mission of the Department is to provide the military forces needed to deter war and to protect the security of the U.S. Since the creation of our first army in 1775, the Department and its predecessor organizations have ev olved into a global presence of 2.9 million individuals that are dedicated to defending the U.S. by deterring and defeating aggression and coercion in critical regions. The QDR constitutes the DoD's strategic plan. On February 3, 2006, the Department unveiled its most recent QDR, charting the way ahead for the next 20 years. The QDR report acknowledges that the Department has been and is transforming along a continuum that shifts emphasis from the 20th century to the 21st century. The foundation of the 2006 QDR are the National Military Strategy, published in May 2004 and the National Defense Strategy, published in March 2005. The 2006 QDR identifies two DoD fundamental imperatives: Continuing to reorient the Department capabilities and forces to be more agile in this time of war, to prepare for wider asymmetric challenges, and to hedge against uncertainty over the next 20 years; and Implementing enterprise-wide changes to ensure that organizational structures, processes, and procedures effectively support its strategic direction. The QDR acknowledges that everything done in the Department must contribute to joint warfighting capability. Its purpose is to provide the U.S. with strong, sound, and effective warfighting capabilities.

Consequently, strategic goal 1 is focused on the ongoing major conflict and extended stabilization campaign in Iraq and Afghanistan. At the same time, the 2006 QDR recognized that the Department needed to recast its view of future warfare through the lens of a long duration and globally-distributed conflict. Therefore, strategic goal 2 focuses on reorienting the Armed Forces to deter and defend against transnational terrorists around the world. Strategic goal 5 recognizes that the DoD cannot meet today's complex challenges alone. This goal recognizes integrated security cooperation and strategic communication as additional tool sets the Combatant Commanders may use to fight wars. Together, these three goals encompass the Department's warfighting missions. Strategic goals 3 and 4 focus on developing a Total Force and reshaping the defense infrastructure, respectively, in ways that better support the warfighter. Therefore, these goals are seen as supporting goals that enable accomplishment of the Department's primary strategic goals 1, 2, and 5 (Figure 3.10). Based on the above over-arching QDR goals, a task force and Senior Review Group (SRG) were established in January 2007 to develop a limited number of strategic objectives and performance targets at the joint or enterprise-level. The task force and SRG included representatives from each OSD Principal Staff, the Joint Staff, and the Military Departments. As a result of their efforts, seventeen strategic objectives and 52 initial performance targets were developed for FY 2007 (Table 3.1). FY 2007 Performance Results For FY 2007, the Deputy Secretary of Defense/Chief Management Officer approved a select number of performance targets for enterprise-level strategic assessment. The FY 2008 Performance Budget/Plan identifies 52 performance targets for FY 2007. However, three performance targets were subsequently eliminated because they lacked viable measurement methodologies, as identified below: Target 1.1-3: Percent of DoD reconstruction projects in Iraq and Afghanistan completed; Target 2.3-3: Percent reduction in known impediments to intelligence access; and Target 3.3-2: Average percent of materiel availability readiness goals achieved for major weapon systems. Of the remaining 49 performance targets for FY 2007, actual results are available on 45 targets, with four target results not available until March 2008.

The Department achieved an overall success rate of 69 percent by meeting or exceeding 31 of the 45 performance results reported to date. Thirty-one percent (or fourteen) performance target results for FY 2007 were not achieved. Eight of the fourteen targets that were not achieved had little impact on DoD's military posture since these were focused on improving infrastructure support in such areas as facilities sustainment, audit readiness, and system accreditation. However, some of the other targets that were not achieved resulted in adverse impacts to DoD military operations. The under-achievement in counterintelligence (target 2.4-1) resulted in increased risk of exploitation by terrorists and cyber threats. The two day delay in average customer wait time (target 3.3-1) had a negative affect on providing timely logistics support to DoD warfighters. Of particular note, the Department achieved all of its FY 2007 performance targets associated with: Iraq and Afghanistan transition (Strategic Objective 1.1); Homeland defense (Strategic Objective 2.1); and Force restructuring (Strategic Objective 2.2). FY 2008 Performance Plan For FY 2008, the Deputy Secretary of Defense/Chief Management Officer approved the following changes to previously established FY 2007 performance targets: Added three new performance targets: - Target 3.2-1: Percent of completing demonstration programs transitioning per year; - Target 4.4-2: Percent of units receiving joint training in Joint National Training Center (JNTC) accredited programs prior to arriving in theater; and - Target 4.4-4: Cumulative number of Defense intelligence components converted to the Defense Civilian Intelligence Personnel System. Deferred the following performance target to FY 2009, pending development of a performance data baseline: - Target 4.4-1: Percent of operational and contingency language needs met. These changes result in increasing the number of enterprise- level performance targets from 49 in FY 2007 to 51 in FY 2008, as summarized at Table 3-1. FY 2009 Performance Plan For FY 2009, the Deputy Secretary of Defense/Chief Management Officer, approved the following changes to FY 2008 performance targets: Restored one performance target: - Target 4.4-1: Percent of operational and contingency language needs met. Eliminated the following performance target because it is projected to be completed in FY 2008: - Target 2.3-1a: Percent of Joint Intelligence Operations Centers at initial operating capability (IOC). This net change results in retaining 51 performance targets for FY 2009, as summarized at Table 3-1. On November 13, 2007, the President signed Executive Order (EO) 13450 \"Improving Program Performance\" to reiterate this initiative and his Administration's policy that taxpayer dollars should be spent effectively and more efficiently each year. This EO draws increased attention for Agencies to have both annual and long-term performance improvement. Table 3-1 indicates that DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT 131 57 percent (or 29 DoD enterprise-level targets) project incremental performance improvement between FY 2008 and FY 2009. While several performance targets do not reflect incremental improvement, the targets are considered ambitious in light of significant external factors that challenge the Department's ability to sustain current performance levels in a variety of DoD mission areas. These include, but are not limited to, performance targets associated with managing Active and Reserve end strengths and controlling cost growth for Major Defense Acquisition Programs and military healthcare. DoD Program Assessment Rating Tool Utilization Lower-level performance information (by DoD budget activity, program element, procurement line item, and project) are identified throughout the various appropriation-specific budget justification material, provided under separate cover. In addition, enterprise-level performance targets are augmented by lower-level performance targets at the program-level. Some of these performance targets are reflected in DoD's PART input, used by the OMB to evaluate Federal government programs. To date, the Administration has completed 89 PARTs, covering over $400 billion of the DoD discretionary base budget. PART diagnostics have been applied to 54 unclassified DoD program areas. As a result, 48 DoD programs have been assessed at the adequate level or higher, as summarized at Figure 3.11. Only six programs have been rated \"Results not Demonstrated\" (RND) based, primarily, on lack of quantifiable outcome measures. Performance improvement plans have been developed and forwarded to the OMB for each DoD PARTed area. While every PART has a plan that includes process improvements for FY 2009, not all program areas project quantifiable outcome improvements based on mission priority and fund availability. Based on this input, 19 of 54 unclassified DoD PARTed areas project incremental performance improvement between FY 2008 and FY 2009. The Defense Department considers PART findings, in conjunction with other internal program assessments, audits, inspections, and other management reviews to inform budget development. The DoD will be working with the OMB to determine appropriate measures for the RND-rated programs and to apply the PART to the balance of its programs and budget by the end of FY 2008. DoD Performance Budget Challenges and Initiatives OMB Circular A-11, Part 6 addresses preparation and submission of agency annual performance plans/budgets that link strategic objectives with costs for achieving targeted levels of performance. The alignment of the DoD budget among strategic goals and objectives presents a challenge given: The size ($515.4 billion for FY 2009) and complexity of the Defense budget; The tendency to focus on process\u2014not outcomes; and The absence of DoD budget and accounting systems that support a \"total cost\" concept.

The Defense budget aggregates the approximately 6,500 program elements into approximately 475 budget activities that are presented to the Congress for funding from approximately 116 different DoD appropriation accounts. Once funds are appropriated, these are distributed to approximately 45 different DoD organizations. Some performance targets continue to focus on internal process vice strategic outcome-oriented results. The Department's transition in this area is still evolving and is expected to improve with each subsequent cycle. A process to evaluate DoD performance targets (measures and milestones) for relevancy to strategic objectives and decision-making is under development. The Department is also hindered by the lack of budget and accounting systems that were not designed to accumulate \"total costs\" associated with accomplishing specific objective areas. Under this scenario, the Department must rely on complex crosswalks and data mapping schemes to be able to display its budget among strategic goals and objectives. These necessary crosswalks will take time to develop and validate before the Department will be in a position to display and justify its budget along these lines. The QDR directed integration of the Department's strategic planning and resource allocation processes. Last year, the OSD Program Analysis and Evaluation and OSD Comptroller stood up a joint Data Structure Working Group for a new, combined data structure that would provide a seamless connection between programming and budgeting and provide an end-to-end view of resource decisions from formulation through execution. One advantage of the new proposed data structure will be the ability to create comprehensive views of programs into groupings of interest to staff who manage programs and senior leaders who need to make strategic resource allocation trades. The Department welcomes the opportunity to brief the Congress on its ensuing performance budget efforts and planned performance improvements for FY 2009.

These achievements benefit decision makers by making information more timely and accurate. Accomplishments included improvements in audit readiness, elimination of internal control weaknesses, and improvements in the effectiveness of financial operations. All were due in large part to developing a stronger financial management workforce. Today, the Department is: Ready to achieve a clean audit opinion in 2009 on more than two-thirds of its assets and liabilities, totaling $2.4 trillion; On track to eliminate the remaining 19 of the original 116 managers' internal control weaknesses identified in 2001; Improving efficiencies in financial operations, which lowers costs to the warfighter. The Defense Finance and Accounting Service has increased its productivity by 52 percent, resulting in $317 million in savings since 2001; and Investing in its financial management workforce by establishing a first-of-its-kind Chief Financial Officer Academy. Today, more than half of OSD Comptroller staff members have at least one professional certification. Department-Wide Clean Audit The progress toward a DoD-wide clean audit is one of the Department's most significant financial management accomplishments. In 2001, critics predicted that the Department's leadership would not be able to turn around its complex financial management operations. Seven years later, DoD's financial management has been transformed into a high- performing enterprise program that delivers critical information to decision-makers and warfighters to achieve mission success. In FY 2001, only $879 billion in combined DoD assets and liabilities received unqualified audit opinions. By FY 2007, DoD cleanly audited $1.3 trillion or 36 percent of all assets and liabilities. This accomplishment is due to the Department's comprehensive Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR) Plan (Figure 3.12). The FIAR Plan was developed in 2005 to establish the timeline and milestones for improved financial management and to obtain a clean audit. To ensure transparency and maintain strong levels of confidence, the Department reports on its accomplishments by updating the FIAR Plan for Congress and the OMB every six months. The September 2007 update of the FIAR Plan expanded on the Department's incremental approach, incorporated lessons learned, and highlighted progress already achieved. Results achieved under the FIAR Plan within the last year included the following: Figure 3.12 Progress Towards A Department-Wide Clean Audit 106-230255075100 2001 2007 2009 2010+% Cleanly Audited 25%68%100% $0.9$2.4$3.6 Source: DoD Financial Management Metrics Dollars in Trillions 3.6 01.02.03.0 $1.336% Numbers do not add due to rounding DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT ACCOMPLISHMENTS 148 The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers received a qualified opinion on its financial statement audit for FY 2006 and FY 2007. The Corps is the largest DoD entity to receive a favorable opinion to date and the lessons learned are being applied across the Department; and The Defense Information Systems Agency is undergoing an audit of its Balance Sheet, which portrays the Agency's assets and liabilities. Favorable results in this area will provide the basis for auditing its remaining financial statements. Progress towards a Department-wide clean audit will continue into FY 2009, when DoD expects to receive clean audit opinions on $2.4 trillion, which is more than two-thirds (68 percent) of the Department's assets and liabilities. This achievement will be extraordinary since the new majo r Service financial systems will not yet be operational. By FY 2010, the Department expects unqualified opinions for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Defense Information Systems Agency, the Medicare Eligible Retiree Health Care Fund, the TRICARE Management Activity, and the U.S. Marine Corps. This equates to 50 percent ($747 billion) of DoD's assets and 89 percent ($1,818 billion) of its liabilities being audit-ready. Improving Financial Stewardship Stronger internal controls have reduced opportunities for waste, fraud, and abuse and increased efficiencies in several processes: A reduction in self-identified internal control weaknesses from 116 to only 19 (Figure 3.13); Zero material weaknesses in the DoD civilian pay system internal controls design, as reported by the Office of the Inspector General (OIG); Praise from the Government Accountability Office for policies and controls over Premium Class Travel, that are examples for other Federal agencies to follow; $452 million in duplicate payments prevented in FY 2005 alone; A successful \"Check It!\" campaign that is championed by Deputy Secretary Gordon England and other top Department leaders and which is heightening awareness of internal controls throughout the Department; and Audits conducted by the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) on $358 billion of contracts in FY 2007, that saved the Department $2.4 billion and provided to investigators with information that resulted in DoD recovering $225 million in 167 investigations.

In 2004, DoD received 1.7 million electronic invoices per quarter (64 percent of total) and has increased that amount to 2.4 million (82 percent of total); Since 2001, DoD has avoided $247 million in interest penalties by paying invoices on time, while experiencing a two-fold increase in the dollar amount of payments made. This means more budget dollars for operational needs instead of administrative expenses; The Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS), which provides accounting and finance services for the Military Departments and Defense agencies, increased its rate of operation and eliminated excess capacity, resulting in a 52 percent increase in productivity and lower costs to the Services by $317 million since 2001 (Figure 3.14); The Department's Fund Balance with Treasury account, which reflects the DoD budget available for spending, is nearly 100 percent accurate (Figure 3.15). This account reconciles DoD records with the Department of Treasury's records. This helps to ensure that requests for additional taxpayer dollars are for true funding shortfalls; Figure 3.14 Increasing DFAS Productivity while Lowering Costs 106-2310,00012,00014,00016,00018,00020,000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 20075,0007,0009,00011,000 30% Reduction in Labor Resulted in $317 Million in Lower CostsEmployeesTransactions per Employee Source: Defense Finance and Accounting Service Figure 3.15 Reconciling DoD's Fund Balance with Treasury 97.0%97.5%98.0%98.5%99.0%99.5%100.0% 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007Net Improvement 99% Improvement 106-23 Source: DoD Financial Management Metrics 52% Productivity Increase DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT ACCOMPLISHMENTS 150 DoD reduced inaccurate accounting records by over 96 percent, thereby reducing the risk of fraudulent transactions (Figure 3.16); The accounts used by base commanders to manage funds received from outside the command - known as exempt clearing accounts - differed from the balances recorded at the Department of Treasury. Within three months of discovery, the Department corrected every account and has maintained 100 percent reconciliation with Treasury balances ever since; Military and civilian personnel pay is more than 99 percent accurate for the three million active, Reserve, and retired military personnel and civilian employees paid each month. Not having to worry about being paid accurately allows DoD personnel to give their best to the task at hand; The DoD OIG conducts operational audits and makes recommendations to improve efficiencies and operations within the Department. In FY 2007, the OIG auditors identified $697 million which was better aligned toward other warfighter needs; and Today, 100 percent of GWOT cost reporting is traceable to an accounting system (92 percent) or a validated cost model (8 percent), providing better transparency for both the Congress and the American people. As a result of efficiency improvements, DoD is able to pay invoices in a more timely manner, thereby reducing the cost of operations, reducing interest penalties, and improving relationships with vendors. This leads to better payment terms and attracts more potential vendors, which increases competition and lowers costs to the Department. $0$500$1,000$1,500$2,000$2,500$3,000Figure 3.16 Reducing Inaccurate Accounting Entries 106-23$ in Millions 1999 2001 2003 2005 2007Dollars Source: DoD Financial Management Metrics 96% Reduction U.S. Army Soldiers patrol the streets of Tunis, Iraq.

Thomas - October, 2007 DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT ACCOMPLISHMENTS 151 Improvements in financial management are also a result of the business transformation efforts established in the Enterprise Transition Plan, which focuses pr imarily on implementing new or updated systems into an integrated business network. Major goals and accomplishments include: Implementing financial systems that comply with Federal financial management requirements. Several entities have successfully implemented pilots of modern integrated systems and are preparing for full system roll-out across the entire organization. The Navy, Army, Air Force, and Defense Logistics Agency all have pilot programs demonstrating huge successes; Defining and implementing a common language - the Standard Financial Information Structure (SFIS) - that provides standard definitions and business rules that enable transparency and interoperability of financial information across the Department. This Structure now serves as the template for a government-wide financial data language; and Implementing the Business Enterprise Information Service (BEIS) to aggregate financial information and provide Department-wide financial reporting. The BEIS will yield timely, accurate, and reliable financial information and enable comparison of financial data across the Department as never before. BEIS works with other financial management initiatives, such as SFIS, to provide for more informed financial decision-making. The Department is also achieving greater efficiencies by investing in new financial accounting systems. Presently, six of twelve major financial systems have been completed. As these systems become operational, t hey deliver significant improvements in financial operations. For example, the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) recently implemented an Enterprise Resource Planning System that has shortened order processing from one day to four hours, thereby getting material and supplies to the warfighter faster. This system has also streamlined end-of-year financial closing from nine days to two, making the financial information available to management sooner. Recruit and Retain a Professional Workforce These accomplishments are due to DoD's financial management professionals. They have worked with skill and dedication to improve the financial management of the world's largest and most complex organization - and they have done so while DoD has U.S. Hospital Corpsman 1st Class Reynaldo S.

Since 2001 DFAS has improved productivity resulting in $317M in savings available for the Warfighter. U.S. Navy photo by Marine Staff Sgt. Luis P. Valdespino Jr. - January 2008 DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT ACCOMPLISHMENTS 152 been engaged in multiple conflicts and humanitarian missions. The Department is working to ensure that this progress continues by investing in the education and professional development of its financial management workforce: DoD is providing retention incentives, such as financial assistance for employees seeking advanced degrees and professional certifications. Today, more than half of Comptroller staff members have at least one professional certification; The Department is using innovative strategies to recruit employees, including the DFAS Leaders-in-Motion program, which has trained an average of 225 employees per year; To make the most of employee talent, the Department is linking performance to its financial management strategy through the National Security Personnel System Individual Development Plans; and DoD is also investing long-term in its workforce by initiating the Chief Financial Officer Academy at the National Defense University. This effort, similar to existing programs for Chief Information Officers, will help to form a more analytic and broadly skilled financial workforce that will provide value to the taxpayer and greater security to the Nation. SUMMARY Since 2001, the Department of Defense has measurably improved financial management to provide decision-makers timely and accurate information to support our warfighters. Today, the Department's fiscal information, including the Consolidated Balance Sheet (Figure 3.17), provides a more complete depiction of DoD's financial health then ever before. This progress will continue because the Department has strategically invested in its workforce and a detailed plan to achieve optimal financial operations and to obtain a Department-wide clean audit. *RestatedAssets 1,963.2 2,050.7 72.5 Environmental and Disposal Liabilities1,815.8 1,874.7 Military Retirement & Other Federal Employment Benefits27.4 29.7 Accounts Payable18.4 16.7 Total Intragovernmental Liabilities 13.2 11.5 Other Liabilities3.7 3.2 Debt1.5 1.9 Accounts Payable 371.6 355.2 Cumulative Results of Operations - Other Funds -1,271.7 -1,280.1 Cumulative Results of Operations - Earmarked Funds 309.5 380.5 Unexpended Appropriations - Other Funds >0.1 >0.1 Unexpended Appropriations - Earmarked FundsFY 2006* FY 2007 Position 1,372.6 1,506.3 Total Net Position-590.6 -544.4 Total Net Position 465.4 474.5 General Property, Plant and Equipment, Net231.8 224.9 Inventory and Related Property, Net3.9 3.2 Loans Receivable7.9 7.5 Accounts Receivable, Net2.2 15.0 Cash and Other Monetary Assets 27.9 36.2 Other Assets1.1 1.4 Investments and Related Interest299.3 333.7 Investments and Related Interest329.0 407.2 Total 72.5 Environmental and Disposal Liabilities1,815.8 1,874.7 Military Retirement & Other Federal Employment Benefits27.4 29.7 Accounts Payable18.4 16.7 Total Intragovernmental Liabilities 13.2 11.5 Other Liabilities3.7 3.2 Debt1.5 1.9 Accounts Payable 371.6 355.2 Cumulative Results of Operations - Other Funds -1,271.7 -1,280.1 Cumulative Results of Operations - Earmarked Funds 309.5 380.5 Unexpended Appropriations - Other Funds >0.1 >0.1 Unexpended Appropriations - Earmarked FundsFY 2006* FY 2007 Position 1,372.6 1,506.3 Total Net Position-590.6 -544.4 Total Net Position 465.4 474.5 General Property, Plant and Equipment, Net231.8 224.9 Inventory and Related Property, Net3.9 3.2 Loans Receivable7.9 7.5 Accounts Receivable, Net2.2 15.0 Cash and Other Monetary Assets 27.9 36.2 Other Assets1.1 1.4 Investments and Related Interest299.3 333.7 Investments and Related Interest329.0 407.2 Total Receivable, NetFY 2006* FY 2007Figure 3.17 Consolidated Balance Sheet ($ in billions) Source: FY 2007 DoD Performance and Accountability Report MAJOR WEAPONS SYSTEMS DoD FY 2009 Budget Request Summary Justification 1000106 MAJOR WEAPONS SYSTEMS 153 Major Weapons Systems 159.7175.5 FY 2007 FY 2008 FY Strategic Modernization Breakdown Previously Appropriated FY09 RequestHIGHLIGHTS OVERVIEW The combined capabilities and performance of U.S. weapons systems are unmatched throughout the world, ensuring that our military forces have the tactical edge over any adversary.

To preserve and build upon this advantage, the Department's FY 2009 budget includes $183.8 billion to continue its strategic modernization - $104.2 billion for Procurement and $79.6 billion for RDT&E. The need for investment spending addresses DoD activity levels and the nature of the threats our warfighters face. Funding for weapons systems is typically higher in times of war or conflict. Yet, due to the constant evolution of threat conditions, the Department cannot defer its modernization effort without accepting unacceptable future risk. The FY 2009 budget represents the greatest investment since the Cold War in sustaining U.S. technological advantage (Figure 4.1). This is largely a result of significant transformation efforts underway to replace aging and outdated weapon systems and to modify existing weapons to address component obsolescence and improve performance against future threats. Funding for weapon systems has a significant impact on our national economy and American technology. Defense acquisitions have been instrumental to developments in space communications and surveillance, the information and communications revolutions, the Internet, and advances in digital imagery. Over the past 50 years, many major fields of technological advance have been influenced by the Department's investments. OVERSIGHT AND REFORM The Defense Acquisition System is the management process by which the Department acquires weapon systems and automated information systems. Its continuous objective is to rapidly acquire quality products that satisfy user needs with measurable improvements to reliability and capability at a fair and reasonable cost to the American taxpayer. Although the Defense Acquisition System provides flexibility and encourages innovation, it maintains a strict emphasis on discipline and accountability. It applies more stringent oversight to programs of increasing dollar value and management interest. The highest-profile programs are designated as Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAP) and Major Automated Information Systems (MAIS). Accordingly, they have the most extensive statutory and regulatory reporting requirements, requiring review by specific Office of the Secretary of Defense officials. Examples of MDAPs include the F-35 program and the Army's Future Combat Systems (FCS); these .040.080.0120.0160.0200.0240.0280.0Figure 4.1 Historical Acquisition Budget Authority (FY 1949 - 2009) 106-33 Source: Department of Defense National Defense Budget Estimates for FY 2008, Budget Authority by Title in Constant 2008 Dollars(FY 2008 $ in Billions) 1969 1979 1989 1959 2009 1949Procurement RDT&ETotal 1999FY 2009 $183.8 FY 1949 - 2008 data includes supplementals, as applicable.

WEAPON SYSTEM DETAILS The Department's request for stra tegic modernization spans eight categories: Aircraft; Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) Systems; Ground Vehicles; Missile Defense; Munitions and Missiles; Shipbuilding and Maritime Systems; Space Based and Related Systems; Mission Support; and Science and Technology (Figure 4.3). Mission Support includes thousands of critical technology and procurement items that the Department acquires annually to sustain an effective military force and retain a high level of readiness. They include, but are not limited to: small arms, night vision goggles, medical equipment, environmental pollution control systems, training simulators, intelligence support, motor vehicles, and howitzers. A more detailed summary of these and ancillary mission support costs can be found in the RDT&E Program (R-1) and the Procurement Programs (P-1) exhibits, which are posted at the Department's website (Defenselink.mil). As discussed in the Justification chapter, the Department's Science and Technology investment responds to the present day needs of the Department and warfighter, while providing the foundation for superior future capabilities.

The bomber is an all-wing aircraft with twin weapon bays. The B-2's low observability is derived from a combination of reduced infrared, acoustic, electromagnetic, visual, and radar signatures. The dramatically reduced sum of these signatures makes it difficult for today's sophisticated defensive systems to detect, track, and engage the B-2. The B-2 is capable of delivering massive firepower in a short time, anywhere in the world through high-threat defenses, using both conventional and nuclear munitions. Mission: The primary mission of the B-2 is to enable any theater commander to hold at risk and, if necessary, attack an enemy's war-making potential, especially time-critical targets that, if not destroyed in the first hours or days of a conflict, would allow unacceptable damage to be inflicted on the friendly side. The B-2 will also retain its potential as a nuclear bomber, reinforcing the deterrence of nuclear conflict.

The overarching goal is full spectrum dominance\u2014defeat of any adversary or control of any situation across the full range of military operations\u2014achieved through a broad array of capabilities enabled by an interconnected network of sensors, shooters, command, control, and intelligence. This network- based interconnectivity increases the operational effectiveness by assuring access to the best possible information by decision makers at all levels, thus allowing dispersed forces to communicate, maneuver, share a common user-defined operating picture, and successfu lly complete assigned missions more efficiently. Net-centricity transforms the way that information is managed to accelerate decision-making, improve joint warfighting, and create intelligence advantages. Hence, all information is visible, available, usable and trusted\u2014when needed and where needed\u2014to accelerate the decision cycles. Net-centricity is a services-based architecture pattern for information sharing. It is being implemented by the Command, Control, Communications, Computer, and Intelligence (C4I) community via building joint architectures and roadmaps for integrating joint airborne networking capabilities with the evolving ground, maritime and space networks. It encompasses the development of technologies like gateways, waveforms, network management and information assurance.
