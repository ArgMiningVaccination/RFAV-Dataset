With the recent and ongoing uncoverings of mass unmarked graves at residential schools across the country, the public's understanding around why Indigenous Peoples might experience mistrust with government institutions is growing. \"First Nations, Inuit and M\u00e9tis are wondering\u2014why have we been prioritized for vaccination?\" says Dr. Renee Linklater, Senior Director of Shkaabe Makwa at CAMH. \"They have concerns that are coming from a place of mistrust, due to experiences of oppression and colonization that are very real,\" says Linklater. She's not only referring to residential schools, but a long history of racist government initiatives such as segregated Indian Hospitals, where Indigenous Peoples were subjected to medical experimentation without their consent, and disproportionate levels of Indigenous children in the child welfare system. \"We have always been at the back of the line,\" says Sol Mamakwa, Member of Provincial Parliament for Kiiwetinoong. \"Indigenous Peoples across Canada need to be able to feel safe when they take the COVID-19 vaccine.\" According to recent reports, First Nations, Inuit and M\u00e9tis are experiencing higher vaccination rates than initially anticipated. What is the reason behind this success? Recognizing the historic and ongoing oppression faced by Indigenous Peoples in the health care system, Shkaabe Makwa at CAMH partnered with the MPP Mamakwa to increase awareness about vaccine confidence in Indigenous communities and champion the leadership taking place in Indigenous communities to make the vaccination process culturally appropriate, safe and accessible. The result is an educational video that provides context around why Indigenous Peoples were prioritized for vaccination, and the essential work that was undertaken in Indigenous communities to achieve high rates of vaccine confidence. \"When we see Indigenous leadership, like MPP Sol Mamakwa, step forward to address vaccine hesitancy, it's encouraging,\" says Linklater. \"I took the first dose in Muskrat Dam First Nation, and my second dose in Sandy Lake First Nation and I feel great,\" says Mamakwa. \"When they did the blessing ceremony with the vaccines, that's when I knew I had made the right decision to be there, to get vaccinated with the leadership and the Elders.\" As health care systems across the country look to integrate reconciliation into its structures and practices, the vaccination process for Indigenous communities offers important learnings. \"When we think about national priorities around reconciliation, I think that initiatives like this become extremely important,\" says Linklater. By prioritizing First Nations, Inuit and M\u00e9tis for vaccination, and by following cultural practices around medicines, the health system is taking a step towards reconciliation. \"We take a vaccine because we want to be able to keep our identity, keep our languages and make sure our children and elders are safe from COVID-19,\" says Mamakwa. \"There's a way to acknowledge that the Creator put medicines on the earth for us to be able to utilize, and one of the things that I've really appreciated hearing is the amount of prayer being put forth around these vaccines, and I think that those are really important aspects when we think about some of our traditional protocols,\" says Linklater. Shkaabe Makwa is a new Centre at CAMH designed to drive culturally relevant systems initiatives to achieve health equity and community wellness. Shkaabe Makwa aims to transform health outcomes through the advancement of research, training and innovative healing models that harmonize traditional knowledge and medical expertise. "}
