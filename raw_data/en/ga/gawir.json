Founded by Marc David, Dynamic Eating Psychology, combines the psychology of eating with the science of mind body nutrition; it is the latest and most up-to-date approach there is for healing from \"weight concerns, emotional eating, binge eating, overeating, body image challenges, endless dieting and a variety of nutrition related health concerns such as digestion, fatigue, mood, immunity and more ( [Marc David](http://directory.psychologyofeating.com/our-approach/%20))\" Using an empowering, positive and transformational approach, Dynamic Eating Psychology works using techniques and tools from counselling and coaching models, body centered practices, soul-centred and spiritual psychology, archetypal psychologies, positive psychology, cognitive approaches, Health at Every Size (HAES) and more. Dynamic Eating Psychology is also firmly grounded in the best of clinical and scientific nutrition, complementary and alternative medicine and mind-body sciences. Rather than viewing the person as being a problem or having a problem to get rid of, Dynamic Eating Psychology views food and body concerns as symptoms that are in much need of depth exploration. Holding a soulful and holistic context, by exploring the complexity of these symptoms, we can learn, grow and transform our relationships with self, others, work, money, pleasure, sexuality, lifestyle, nutrition, search for meaning and fulfillment and so on. \"For far too long, we've been inundated by negative messages about food, body, weight and diet. We've been told that we're willpower weaklings or that we need more control. The majority of nutrition experts promote vastly different and conflicting advice. The result is that people are confused about what to eat and how to have a happy relationship with food and a healthy metabolism. Eating Psychology Coaches help you rise above nutritional confusion. They're trained to help you get un-stuck. By eliminating all the \"shoulds and shouldn'ts\", their approach focuses on what's right for your body and your personal style. As you work with an Eating Psychology Coach in this way, food and health issues become a place of exploration. Instead of seeing eating challenges as the enemy, they become opportunities for growth and self-improvement. From here, you're better able to reach your highest goals ( [Marc David](http://directory.psychologyofeating.com/our-approach/%20)).\" What is Mind Body Eating Nutrition? In Psychology and Nutrition: The Perfect Union, [Marc David](//psychologyofeating.com/psychology-nutrition/) writes, \"Mind Body Nutrition is an exciting new approach that looks at the psycho-physiology of how digestion, assimilation, calorie burning and all the nutritive functions of the body are literally and scientifically impacted by stress, relaxation, thought, emotion, pleasure, our personal story, eating rhythm, eating speed and awareness.... WHAT we eat is half the story of good nutrition. The other half of the story is WHO we are as eaters. Mind Body Nutrition provides this all-important missing link to metabolic health.\" What types of food and body concerns are Dynamic Eating Psychology and Mind Body Eating Nutrition useful for?
