The best source of information on how to use these extraordinary drugs is clearly a detailed description of the successes (and failures) of those researchers who have used these compounds to bring curative, creative and growth-potentiating experiences to their patients. A study of their work is recommended in order to identify those elements that lead to successful sessions. Two known essential elements are \"set,\" which involves the personality and expectations of the patient, and \"setting,\" which has to do with the environment of the session. A third element of importance is that of \"matrix,\" which includes consideration of the environment (1) from which an individual comes, (2) in which the individual lives during the time of the sessions, and (3) to which the individual returns after successful therapy\u2014the everyday living space; these three elements are discussed. No [Humanistic Psychology, Psychedelics, and the Transpersonal Vision](https://psychedelics.berkeley.edu/resources/humanistic-psychology-psychedelics-and-the-transpersonal-vision/) In the 1950s and early 1960s the field of humanistic psychology was established, with the founding of the Journal of Humanistic Psychology (JHP) by Abraham Maslow and Anthony Sutich and the Association of Humanistic Psychology founded by Carl Rogers, Virginia Satir, and Maslow in 1961. Also known as the Third Force, following behaviorism (the First Force) and psychoanalysis (the Second Force), humanistic psychology broke with the restrictive and overly deterministic models of conventional psychology of that time and presented a more optimistic vision of human potential, stressing the importance of personal growth and self-actualization. Maslow, one of the leading founders and proponents of humanistic psychology charted a hierarchy of needs in order of decreasing priority yet increasing sophistication, starting with basic physiological needs and safety and extending to belongingness and love, fulfillment, self-worth, and autonomy. [Prohibited or Regulated? LSD Psychotherapy and the United States Food and Drug Administration](https://psychedelics.berkeley.edu/resources/prohibited-or-regulated-lsd-psychotherapy-and-the-united-states-food-and-drug-administration/) Over the 1950s and early 1960s, the use of the hallucinogenic drug lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) to facilitate psychotherapy was a promising field of psychiatric research in the USA. However, during the 1960s, research began to decline, before coming to a complete halt in the mid-1970s. This has commonly been explained through the increase in prohibitive federal regulations during the 1960s that aimed to curb the growing recreational use of the drug. However, closely examining the Food and Drug Administration's regulation of LSD research in the 1960s will reveal that not only was LSD research never prohibited, but that the administration supported research to a greater degree than has been recognized. Instead, the decline in research reflected more complex changes in the regulation of pharmaceutical research and development. [Neo-Shamanism](https://psychedelics.berkeley.edu/resources/neo-shamanism/) This encyclopedia provides an overview of the main religions of Latin America and the Caribbean, both its centralized transnational expressions and its local variants and schisms. These main religions include (but are not limited to) the major expressions of Christianity (Roman Catholicism, Protestantism, Pentecostalism, Mormonism, and Jehovah's Witnesses), indigenous religions (Native American, Maya religion), syncretic Christianity (including Afro-Brazilian religions like Umbanda and Candombl\u00e9 and Afro-Caribbean religions like Vodun and Santer\u00eda), other world religions (Buddhism, Hinduism, Judaism, Islam), transnational New Religious Movements (Scientology, Unification Church, Hare Krishna, New Age, etc.), and new local religions (Brazil's Igreja Universal, La Luz del Mundo from Mexico, etc.). Neoshamanism is a set of discourses and practices involving the integration of indigenous (especially American) shamanic and psychotherapeutic techniques by people from urban Western contexts. It has emerged, like other New Age modes of spirituality, in opposition to the materialism and positivism of European modernity and presents as central the idea of reconnecting panindigenous ancestral knowledge that people of the West had purportedly forgotten. It results in large measure from the circulation of literature on shamanism, altered states of consciousness (often, but not always, involving the use of psychoactive drugs), and the possibility of generating new psychotherapeutic modalities. [Psychoactive Ubulawu Spiritual Medicines and Healing Dynamics in the Initiation Process of Southern Bantu Diviners](https://psychedelics.berkeley.edu/resources/psychoactive-ubulawu-spiritual-medicines-and-healing-dynamics-in-the-initiation-process-of-southern-bantu-diviners/) The use of psychoactive plants by traditional healers in southern Africa appears to be a neglected area of ethnobotanical research. This article explores the healing dynamics involved in the use of popular psychoactive plant preparations known as ubulawu in the initiation rituals of Southern Bantu diviners. Research methods include a review of the literature, fieldwork interviews with Southern Bantu diviners, and an analysis of experiential accounts from diverse informants on their use of ubulawu. Findings reveal that there is widespread reliance on ubulawu as psychoactive spiritual medicines by the indigenous people of southern Africa to communicate with their ancestral spirits\u2014so as to bring luck, and to treat mental disturbances. In the case of the Southern Bantu diviners, ubulawu used in a ritual initiation process acts as a mnemonic aid and medicine to familiarize the initiates with enhanced states of awareness and related psychospiritual phenomena such as enhanced intuition and dreams of the ancestral spirits, who teach the initiates how to find and use medicinal plants. The progression of the latter phenomena indicates the steady success of the initiates' own healing integration. Various factors such as psychological attitude and familiarization, correct plant combinations/synergy and a compatible healer-initiate relationship influence ubulawu responsiveness. [The Intersection of Culture and Science in South African Traditional Medicine](https://psychedelics.berkeley.edu/resources/the-intersection-of-culture-and-science-in-south-african-traditional-medicine/) Traditional African medicine often carries with it a perception and stigma of being irrational and ungrounded in scientific method in academia. One reason for this common prejudicial view of traditional African medicine is the failure to effectively interpret African traditional medicine concepts, as these are often metaphorical descriptions of the biological and psychological effects of plants or combinations of them used in the traditional medicine preparations. When translated into other languages such as English, these metaphorical descriptions of medicinal plant use can seem to incorrectly reflect mysticism and/or superstition with no scientific basis. This difficulty in interpreting cultural descriptions of medical phenomena, together with the fact that there are hardly any academic papers engaging the science of South African traditional medicine in the biological sciences, is an indication of the disconnection between the humanities studies and the biomedical studies of South African traditional medicine. This paper investigates some popular examples of spiritual plant use in traditional South African medicine using phytopharmacological studies together with anthropological fieldwork methods, demonstrating the empirical basis for use of some plants in divination (by producing clarity of thought or dreams). The examples also reveal the phytochemical and biomedical foundations of the South Bantu speaking traditional healers' explanations of why and how various spiritually used plants have medicinal value. The challenge for scientists (such as botanists) is to effectively translate and interpret cultural and language based descriptions of spiritual medicinal plant use made by indigenous peoples while recognizing and discarding cultural prejudices that prevent a more comprehensive and integrated understanding of the science that intersects and forms the basis of many, though not all, cultural healing practices. [Psychoactive Substances and the English Language: \"Drugs,\" Discourses, and Public Policy](https://psychedelics.berkeley.edu/resources/psychoactive-substances-and-the-english-language-drugs-discourses-and-public-policy/) This article undertakes a historical ontology of psychoactive substances, or, in other words, an exploration of the philosophical and political nature of modern categories for plants and chemicals that alter consciousness. Drawing on the ideas of Michel Foucault and Ian Hacking and using the method of critical discourse analysis, I elucidate three distinct contemporary meanings of the English word \"drug.\" Further, I demonstrate how these meanings of \"drug\" map onto a modern stereotypology of psychoactive substances that informs public discourses and sustains an ideological drug war paradigm. I trace this paradigm through the generative metaphors of drugs as \"malevolent agents\" and \"pathogens\" in modern public discourses, and explore how these metaphors frame and support policy responses within the international drug control regime that are inconsistent with human rights. In so doing, I argue that the language we use to talk and think about \"drugs\" may not be ideal for crafting sound public policy. [The Globalization of Ayahuasca: Harm Reduction Or Benefit Maximization?](https://psychedelics.berkeley.edu/resources/the-globalization-of-ayahuasca-harm-reduction-or-benefit-maximization/) Ayahuasca is a tea made from two plants native to the Amazon, Banisteriopsis caapi and Psychotria viridis, which, respectively, contain the psychoactive chemicals harmala alkaloids and dimethyltryptamine. The tea has been used by indigenous peoples in countries such as Brazil, Ecuador and Peru for medicinal, spiritual and cultural purposes since pre-Columbian times. In the 20th century, ayahuasca spread beyond its native habitat and has been incorporated into syncretistic practices that are being adopted by non-indigenous peoples in modern Western contexts. Ayahuasca's globalization in the past few decades has led to a number of legal cases which pit religious freedom against national drug control laws. This paper explores some of the philosophical and policy implications of contemporary ayahuasca use. It addresses the issue of the social construction of ayahuasca as a medicine, a sacrament and a \"plant teacher.\" Issues of harm reduction with respect to ayahuasca use are explored, but so too is the corollary notion of \"benefit maximization.\" [Drug Tourism Or Spiritual Healing? Ayahuasca Seekers in Amazonia](https://psychedelics.berkeley.edu/resources/drug-tourism-or-spiritual-healing-ayahuasca-seekers-in-amazonia/) This research addresses the question of whether Westerners who seek traditional spiritual medicine known as ayahuasca can be best characterized as \"drug tourists\" or as people pursuing spiritual and therapeutic opportunities. Participants in an ayahuasca retreat in Amazonia were interviewed regarding their motivations for participation and the benefits they felt that they received. These findings from the interviews were organized to reveal common motivations and benefits. Contrary to the characterization as \"drug tourists\", the principal motivations can be characterized as: seeking spiritual relations and personal spiritual development; emotional healing; and the development of personal self-awareness, including contact with a sacred nature, God, spirits and plant and natural energies produced by the ayahuasca. The motivation and perceived benefits both point to transpersonal concerns, with the principal perceived benefits involving increased self awareness, insights and access to deeper levels of the self that enhanced personal development and the higher self, providing personal direction in life. [Psychedelic Pleasures: An Affective Understanding of the Joys of Tripping](https://psychedelics.berkeley.edu/resources/psychedelic-pleasures-an-affective-understanding-of-the-joys-of-tripping/) Background: This paper considers the pleasures of psychedelic drugs and proposes a Deleuzian understanding of drugged pleasures as affects. In spite of a large body of work on psychedelics, not least on their therapeutic potentials, the literature is almost completely devoid of discussions of the recreational practices and pleasures of entheogenic drugs. Yet, most people do not use psychedelics because of their curative powers, but because they are fun and enjoyable ways to alter the experience of reality. Methods: In the analytical part of the paper, I examine 100 trip reports from an internet forum in order to explore the pleasures of tripping. Results: The analyses map out how drugs such as LSD and mushrooms - in combination with contextual factors such as other people, music and nature - give rise to a set of affective modifications of the drug user's capacities to feel, sense and act. Conclusion: In conclusion it is argued that taking seriously the large group of recreational users of hallucinogens is important not only because it broadens our understanding of how entheogenic drugs work in different bodies and settings, but also because it may enable a more productive and harm reductive transmission of knowledge between the scientific and recreational psychedelic communities.
