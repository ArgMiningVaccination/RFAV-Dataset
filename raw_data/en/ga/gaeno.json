Tips For Using Crystals During Meditation In order to get the most out of your morning mediation with crystals, I will share a few powerful tips that will help you to get the most out of your experience. Get Comfortable The first thing to focus on is choosing a comfortable place to sit or lie down. You don't want to be uncomfortable during your meditation, so make sure you're in a position that you can maintain for an extended period of time. Hold Your Crystal Once you've found a comfortable position, and you feel ready to start your meditation, hold your crystal in your hands (or alternatively place it in front of you if that feels better) and take a few deep breaths. Visualize Focus on your breath and the crystal in your hand (or in front of you). Visualize the energy of the crystal flowing into your body and soothing away any tension or uneasiness you may be feeling. Thank Your Crystal Once you're finished with your meditation, thank the crystal for its help and place it back in its rightful spot. Practice A Moment Of Gratitude Now, take a few moments to sit in silence and appreciate the peacefulness that you've just created for yourself. You can also choose to repeat a few powerful [affirmations](https://calmingcosmos.com/77-calming-morning-affirmations-to-start-your-day-off-right/) to help you kickstart your day even more. Other Questions You May Have How Do I Choose The Right Crystal For Meditation? Even though choosing the right crystal ultimately all comes down to how you personally connect with it, there are a few things you want to keep in mind when choosing a crystal for your meditation. The first thing you need to keep in mind is to consider the unique properties of the different crystals and find one that resonates with you and what you hope to achieve through meditation. For example, if you're looking to boost creativity, then [Citrine](https://amzn.to/3DTBJEY) could be a crystal you will gravitate towards. If you're looking for a more calming and relaxing meditation, then a crystal like [Rose Quartz](https://amzn.to/3WTwGNd) or [Amethyst](https://amzn.to/3UGt0fW) would be more fitting. Another important factor to consider when choosing a crystal is the size. If you're planning to hold the crystal in your hand during your meditation, you'll want to make sure it is comfortable for you to hold so you won't experience too much of extractions during your meditation. With all of that being said, the best way to choose a crystal for your meditation is to simply hold it in your hand and feel its energetic vibration. If it feels good, then you can be quite sure that it's a great choice to use during meditation. Can I Use More Than One Crystal For Meditation? It is absolutely possible to use more than once crystal for your meditation. In fact, using multiple crystals for meditation an be a great way to amplify the effects of your meditation. I personally like to use multiple crystals for my meditations as well, as I find that it helps me to focus and connect with the energy of the crystals more easily. How Long Should You Meditate For? Depending on your schedule and the amount of time you have available, you could meditate for anywhere from 5 minutes to an hour (or more). I personally aim to meditate for a total of 10-20 minutes, but again, it is up to your personal situation to find what works best for you. If you're just starting out with meditation then it is probably best to start with shorter sessions and work your way up to longer ones. You don't want to push yourself too hard or you may find yourself getting frustrated, which is the opposite effect of what we want to achieve. Start slow and increase the length of your meditation sessions as you become more comfortable with the practice. Final Thoughts Now that you know which crystals are best for morning meditation, it is time to put things into practice.
