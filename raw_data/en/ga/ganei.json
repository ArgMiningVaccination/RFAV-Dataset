Program", "date": "2021-05-01", "cleaned_text": "MENTORSHIP PROGRAM Applications will open in fall 2023. G.E.R.M. Program was developed to provide grants to medical students to support a longitudinal, mentored clinical learning and/or research project for up to a year on infectious diseases-related topics, including HIV, under the mentorship of an IDSA or HIVMA member. This program replaced the IDSA Medical Scholars and HIVMA Medical Students Programs. The goals of the G.E.R.M. Program are to: - Increase interest among undergraduate medical students, particularly among populations underrepresented in medicine, in pursuing ID fellowship post-graduate training or a career in HIV medicine by: - Providing medical students with a mentor-based program to encourage and facilitate the pursuit of a career in the field of infectious diseases; - Increasing the number and diversity of ID and HIV research and clinical learning opportunities available to medical students, including through a diverse range of geographic settings, program sizes and academic foci; and - Providing ID and HIV research and clinical learning opportunities and mentorship and support to a diverse population of medical students, with a focus on those currently underrepresented in the field. - Support medical students in increasing analytical, research and clinical skills that will impact their future career trajectory. Projects must focus on pediatric or adult infectious diseases, including HIV, and may involve either clinical or research activities. Eligible project categories include basic science, epidemiology/clinical research, medical education, structured clinical experiences and quality improvement/program evaluation. Awardees receive a $4,000 stipend to complete their project. ELIGIBILITY Applicants must be medical students (first-, second- or third-year and those in combined degree programs, including MD/MPH and MD/PhD) from an accredited allopathic or osteopathic medical school in the U.S. U.S. citizens and permanent residents pursuing medical school outside of the U.S. (including Caribbean and off-shore institutions) are also eligible to apply. These students should be interested in pursuing specialty training in the U.S. [Back to Fellowships, Grants & Programs >](https://idsafoundation.org/fellowships-grants-programs/) APPLICATIONS Will OPEN In Fall 2023.
