Naturopathic care focuses on treating the whole person, not just the symptoms. Treating the symptoms of an illness is like popping a pill whenever you get a headache. The job of the medication is to stop the pain and it does. But then you get another headache a few days later. Why? Because something else is going on that your body is trying to alert you to. Symptoms are warning signs that something is wrong and the longer they're ignored, or swept under the rug with a pill, the stronger the underlying condition becomes. In our work as naturopathic physicians, we'll help you discover the underlying causes of your symptoms and work with you to heal your body. Whether you've had a throbbing headache for months, your child has a sniffle, or you just want to know what's going on in your body, naturopathic care can return your body to its natural, healthy rhythms.
