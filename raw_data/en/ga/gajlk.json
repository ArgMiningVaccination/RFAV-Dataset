You can find that post here: [10 Organic, Natural, Vegan and Cruelty Free Red Lipsticks for World Vegan Month](https://goneswatchingxo.wordpress.com/2018/11/02/10-organic-natural-and-cruelty-free-red-lipsticks-for-world-vegan-month/) Though these aren't strictly vegan, all these companies are dedicated to creating cruelty free lipsticks and I thought I'd mention them ... simply because they are worth mentioning! My favourite from this bunch are [African Nights](https://goneswatchingxo.wordpress.com/2016/09/24/noyah-lipstick-hazelnut-cream-deeply-in-mauve-and-african-nights/) and [KW Red](https://goneswatchingxo.wordpress.com/2017/01/06/kjaer-weis-lipstick-review-and-swatches-brilliant-and-kw-red-lipstick-a-deux-gift-set-samples-of-love-and-empower/). Surprisingly, the dryness of KW Red actually makes it the most wearable, because it doesn't feel like it's going to slip around and accidentally end up on your lips. The only shade out of these that doesn't suit me the best is [Nolita by Nu Evolution](https://goneswatchingxo.wordpress.com/2018/09/01/nu-evolution-lipstick-swatches-diva-chianti-entice-feisty-nolita-and-fierce/) and that's due to the strong blue undertones. - RMS Beauty - [Beloved](https://goneswatchingxo.wordpress.com/2017/03/29/rms-beauty-lip2cheek-swatches-curious-smile-and-beloved/) - Nu Evolution - [Femme Fatale](https://goneswatchingxo.wordpress.com/2018/07/24/nu-evolution-lipstick-swatches-melon-coquette-sultry-and-femme-fatale/), - [Lucy's Party](https://goneswatchingxo.wordpress.com/2016/11/16/ilia-beauty-lipstick-review-and-swatches-limited-edition-shades-the-brides-lucys-party-and-madam-mina/) If you're curious about any of the shades individually, then use the links to see their separate reviews. Red is now my go to shade aside from the ever safe nude! Wear it with pride I say, there is no better shade for that extra boost "}
