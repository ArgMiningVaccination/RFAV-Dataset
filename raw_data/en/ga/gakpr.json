Signal Transduct Target Ther ; 8(1): 189, 2023 05 | ID: covidwho-20233771 ABSTRACTCurrent attempts in [vaccine]delivery systems concentrate on replicating the natural dissemination of live pathogens, but neglect that pathogens evolve to evade the [immune system]rather than to provoke it. In the case of enveloped [RNA viruses], it is the natural dissemination of [nucleocapsid protein](NP, core [antigen]) and [surface antigen]that delays NP [surveillance]. Here, we [report]a multi-layered [aluminum hydroxide]-stabilized [emulsion](MASE) to dictate the delivery sequence of the [antigens]. In this manner, the receptor-binding domain (RBD, [surface antigen]) of the spike [protein]was trapped inside the nanocavity, while NP was absorbed on the outside of the droplets, enabling the burst release of NP before RBD. Compared with the natural [packaging]strategy, the inside-out strategy induced potent [type I interferon]-mediated [innate immune responses]and triggered an immune-potentiated [environment]in advance, which subsequently boosted CD40+ DC activations and the engagement of the [lymph nodes]. both and Th1-biased [immune response], which diminished viral loads after lethal challenge. By simply reversing the delivery sequence of the [surface antigen]and core [antigen], the inside-out strategy may offer major implications for enhanced [vaccinations]against the enveloped [RNA virus].
