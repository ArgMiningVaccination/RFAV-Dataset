Personally, this summer has been a time of loss for me, a time of adjustment, and a time for new life and growth. It seems like my garden reflected my life this season and endured struggles, storm battering, and eventual blooming, a road that many of us patiently navigate often in life. Each time we hopefully gain new strength from our experiences and will confidently bloom the stronger and more beautiful for it. If you have children of school age, you've probably spent a busy summer during the school break and are now in the back-to-school mode, not always an easy time! However, Amy Emnett has some aromatherapy answers for sleep issues with little ones in association with this topic in her article on Aromatherapy and Sleep Issues in Children during the School Year . Looking ahead to Thanksgiving, KG Stiles guides us on which essential oils are useful for such a celebration and gathering of family and friends. Sandra Nosek gives advice on how to use aromatherapy to treat burns; while Lisa Zochert looks at the potential for using essential oils to help with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorders (ADHD). With regard to essential oil and carrier oil profiles in this issue, we get a closer look at the Myrataceae plant family with Cheryl Murphy; apricot kernel oil with Elizabeth Ashley; arnica oil with Shanti Dechen; and ginger essential oil with Jade Shutes. I also take a look at how rosemary essential oil may help with memory issues. Finally, Kathy Sadowski writes an in-depth essay on how many of our plant species are threatened, with regard to essential oil use. And, of course, we have the usual round up of some favorite autumn recipes from our NAHA directors. Whatever your aromatic interests, we have a wide variety of plants, essential oils, and topics from our talented writers that may resonate with you in more ways than one. Reflect, assess, learn, and plan for the next part of your aromatherapy journey with us - and take time to enjoy these beautiful, warming days of autumn, both inside and out! With aromatic blessings, Sharon Falsetto Sharon Falsetto, BA (Hons), NAHA Certified Professional Aromatherapist\u00ae Journal Autumn 2017.3 \u00a9 Copyright Return Copyright 2017 NAHA Return Use for Burns by Sandra J. Nosek RN, BSN, IAC Introduction In June of 1971, my Uncle Bill was driving his gravel truck for work and was struck on the side by a vehicle who ran a stop sign. The fuel splashed onto my uncle, who was in the cab of the truck, and the truck ignited from friction causing him to suffer third-degree burns over 65% of his body. My uncle was in the hospital for many months and suffered many infections while there, one of which caused ototoxicity, which is hearing loss due to the use of a medication. In this particular situation it was an antibiotic, generally aminoglycosides, that they used to fight the infection. My uncle underwent many debridements of dead tissue and my aunt said he would be cold and shivering after each one. She would have hot tea waiting for him. Because hypovolemia or low fluid volume is common, he had to have at least thirty-two blood transfusions from which he also developed Hepatitis C. My uncle underwent many skin grafts using pig skin because he had no skin of his own to use. He suffered setback after setback but eventually he came home. I was only nine years old but I remember the first time I saw him and how I didn't even see the burns on his skin but noticed how much weight he had lost. Through the years I admired his optimism, his love of life and his \"Don't let anything stand in your way or get you down\" philosophy. I am so proud of his strength and courage. I wish back then we knew what we know today about aromatherapy and topical application of essential oils for wound healing, infections and anxiety. The use of aromatherapy may have reduced my uncle's hospital length of stay, decreased or eliminated his infections, possibly eliminated his hearing loss as a result, or calmed him when he was anxious, or relieved how cold he was after debridement. Aromatherapy could have been taught in a single visit to my aunt for her to administer to him, or to the many nurses and doctors providing his care and dressing changes. He was so thankful to be able to return to his career for almost another thirty-six years before his passing. My aunt said his motto was to \"keep on trucking!\" And that is just what he did! I would like to thank my aunt Carol for allowing me to share his story. Burns Burns to the skin are caused by heat, cold, electricity, chemicals, friction or radiation. 1 Various research studies have shown essential oils and aromatherapy to be effective for patients with burns. Two different application methods were used in these studies; topical application and inhalation. Both application methods were proven to be beneficial in reducing infection, pain, and anxiety, in addition to improved healing time. Essential oils can be beneficial to minimize scarring, improve self-esteem, pain reduction, decrease In Honor of my Uncle Bill8 Aromatherapy Journal Autumn 2017.3 \u00a9 Copyright 2017 NAHA Return to Topinfection and often prevent it. Essential oils and aromatherapy can also help with depression, grief and anxiety. The purpose of this article is not to assist with first aid remedies nor is it to discuss each type of burn; rather it is to look at complimentary options for preventing infections and long- lasting care of partial and full thickness burn injuries, as well as emotional well-being of the individual experiencing this injury. Superficial BurnsFirst degree burns are superficial and appear reddened but without blisters and can often be treated at home. Once the area is healed, usually within a few days, it is typically forgotten. This type of burn can benefit from an application of aloe vera ( Aloe barbadensis) gel and/or cool compresses on the affected area. Partial Thickness Burns Second degree burns appear with blisters, are often very painful and can take up to eight weeks to heal. Partial thickness burns are also known as a second-degree burns. This type of burn affects the top two layers of skin and if infected can turn into a full thickness burn even after the initial treatment. 2 This type of burn can also cause fluid loss and shock if the total body surface area is large. There are many considerations physicians make in determining whether a burn is partial thickness or full thickness. Full Thickness Burns Third degree burns extend through all layers of skin while fourth degree burns extend into muscle, tendon, cartilage and bone. These are considered full thickness burns and require treatment by a physician, hospitalization and often skin grafting. Third and fourth degree burns affect individuals for a long time and in many ways. They are primarily due to decreased mobility in the affected area, called a contracture due to severe scarring and decreased elasticity of the skin and disfigurement, resulting in diminished self-esteem, anxiety, feeling of coldness, and pain with debridement, an increased risk of infection, depression, and often grief. Individuals who suffer from these types of burns sometimes require adaptive tools and often prosthetics to help with activities of daily living. Grief and depression can be caused by decreased socialization and loss of time from work. Essential Oil Studies with BurnsA case study was done to assess the use of essential oils following traumatic burn injury taken from data retrieved from Midwestern Pediatric Hospital. This was a comparative study on a matched case control design following each patient through hospitalization. One child received treatment with essential Aromatherapy Use for Burns continued Skin AnatomyAutumn 2017.3 NAHA's Aromatherapy Journal9 \u00a9 Copyright 2017 NAHA Return to Topoils and the other did not. According to this case study \"the child [who] received only standard care was diagnosed with two blood stream infections and four hospital-acquired conditions while the child who received supplemental treatment with essential oils did not develop any blood stream infections, was diagnosed with one hospital acquired condition, was in the PICU [Pediatric Intensive Care Unit] one day less and had a four-day shorter length of hospital stay.\" 3 This is fascinating news and one that breeds hope for future complimentary care in the hospital setting. Wound HealingThere were four studies that stood out on burn wound healing. The first being spike lavender (Lavandula aspic L.) essential oil, the second with the use of German chamomile (Matricaria chamomilla ) essential oil, the third with use of blumea ( Blumea balsamifera) essential oil, and the fourth with tea tree ( Melaleuca alternifolia) essential oil. In the spike lavender ( Lavandula aspic L.) essential oil study using a rat model with a topical treatment of spike lavender (Lavandula aspic L.) essential oil in a 4% ointment, the study showed to significantly enhance wound contraction rate and protein synthesis. 4 This strongly supports the use of spike lavender (Lavandula aspic L.) essential oil for tissue repair. The only safety consideration is that the maximum dermal use level of camphor is 19%. 5 In the second study, German chamomile (Matricaria chamomilla ) extract was used topically in olive ( Olea europaea) oil twice daily in the treatment group; the control group received no treatment and the vehicle group received only olive oil. They concluded Aromatherapy Use for Burns continued Topical Wound Blend for a Partial Thickness Burn Ingredients: 10 mL aloe vera ( Aloe barbadensis ) Directions for Making and Use: Mix together in a dark amber jar and store in a cool dark place near kitchen. Use this blend two to three times daily until healed. This is a 5% blend. Topical Wound Blend for a Full Thickness Burn Ingredients: 10 mL evening primrose (Oenothera biennis Essential Oils: 10 L.) 6 drops laurel camphor (Cinnamomum camphor)* Directions for Making and Use: Mix these ingredients together and store in a dark amber jar. Apply to affected area twice daily for full thickness burn care approved and overseen by a physician. Store in a cool dark place. This is a 4% blend. Cautions: Avoid use with homeopathic remedies. Avoid use in pregnancy and with babies and young children. *Laurel camphor essential oil is identical in composition to sambong ( Blumea balsamifera) whose high price prevents its occurrence in European and American commerce. 1910 Aromatherapy Journal Autumn 2017.3 \u00a9 Copyright 2017 NAHA Return to Topa significant of German chamomile ( Matricaria ) extract.6 In addition, German chamomile (Matricaria chamomilla ) essential oil could be used as an alternative to the chamomile extract. In the third study, the use of sambong ( Blumea balsamifera) essential oil resulted in rapid wound healing in rats with deep second-degree burns. 7 The only safety consideration found was to use caution if allergic to ragweed.8 Tea tree ( Melaleuca alternifolia) essential oil was used in a hydrogel form topically and proved to be effective in cooling the burn but also accelerated wound healing. 9 Tea tree ( Melaleuca alternifolia) essential oil is generally safe but caution should be used around animals and maximum dermal use for humans is 15%. 10 Further studies are needed for medical staff to appreciate the impact this can make on burn wound care. Gram-negative Bacteria Gram-negative bacteria is common in burn infections. The use of geranium ( Pelargonium graveolens) essential oil in one study showed that it was effective against gram-negative pathogens in the use and recurrent infections caused by resistant organisms. 11 There is a minimal risk for sensitization and maximum dermal use is 17.5%.12 It is plausible that geranium (Pelargonium graveolens) essential oil could be used at 5% effectively and without harm. Anxiety, Pain and Pain Intensity ` One randomized clinical trial of rose (Rosa x damascena ) essential oil was carried out via inhalation on fifty patients with second and third degree burns, with the control group inhaling distilled water. This study suggests inhalation of rose ( Rosa x damascena ) essential oil for reducing pain and pain intensity in burn victims with dressing changes, and not just a merely possible as seen in this quote: \"there was a significant difference between the mean of pain intensity before and after intervention at fifteen and thirty minutes after dressing changes.\" 13 It is well known the positive effects of lavender (Lavandula angustifolia) essential oil with anxiety, but in a single-blind clinical trial on ninety patients with burns a blend of rose (Rosa x damascena ) and lavender (Lavandula angustifolia) essential oils was used, and massage using lavender ( Lavandula angustifolia) essential oil and sweet almond (Prunis dulcis ) oil as a carrier reduced anxiety and pain in burn patients compared to the control group. 14 There are no safety considerations on topical or inhalation of either of these two essential oils. Aromatherapy Use for Burns continued Topical Wound Blend for Burn Infections Ingredients: 20 mL aloe vera ( Aloe barbadensis ) for Making and Use: Create a 5% hydrogel using these ingredients. Mix together and store in a dark amber jar, in a cool dark place. Apply to infected area of burn cover with a xeroform (bismuth impregnated Vaseline gauze as standard burn care) and wrap every eight hours and as needed as overseen and approved by physician.Autumn 2017.3 NAHA's Aromatherapy Journal11 \u00a9 Copyright 2017 NAHA Return to TopSelf-Esteem Although not a study on burn patients, one study was conducted on self-esteem and reflected that ylang-ylang ( Cananga odorata ) essential oil was beneficial in significantly improving self-esteem.15 One would want to ensure to not use topically on damaged tissue or with a child under two years of age.16 This would best be diffused in the room of a burn victim to uplift and improve self-esteem. Carrier Research Aloe vera (Aloe barbadensis) gel was found in one study to enhance epithelialization and granulation of burn wounds better than nitrofurazone which is commonly used to treat burn wounds. This study goes on to say that \"it can be explained by its hydrocolloid and moisturizing and anti-inflammatory effects.\"17 Evening 10% dilution rate with an unscented white cream and applied topically in another study improved wound healing in radiation burns over the common radiation burn treatment using Lioxasol. 18 Aloe vera (Aloe olive ( Olea europaea) oil make wonderful carriers for damaged skin tissue as seen in burn victims. ConclusionFull thickness burns can change one's life, self-esteem, personality, and even their career depending on the extent of the injury. If they had used aromatherapy as part of my uncle's therapies, it would have possibly reduced his infections, decreased his length of stay, decreased anxiety and possibly prevented his hearing loss. Research studies in the lab Aromatherapy Use for Burns continued Massage Blend for Pain and Anxiety Ingredients: 30 mL sweet almond (Prunus dulcis) oil Essential Oils: 6 drops rose ( ) 6 drops lavender ( Lavandula angustifolia ) Making and Use: Mix together a 2% dilution massage oil blend and store in a dark amber dropper bottle for relief of pain and anxiety. The base blend of essential oil can be used without the carrier oil and diffused and inhaled for relief of anxiety and pain as well. Ylang-ylang (Cananga odorata ) Directions for Making and Use: In a 15 mL dark amber dropper bottle make a diffuser blend using 7.5 mL ylang ylang (Cananga odorata ( Lavandula angustifolia ) essential oil. From this blend, add 5-6 drops to filtered water using a nebulizer diffuser as needed to improve self-esteem and reduce anxiety. 12 Aromatherapy Journal Autumn 2017.3 \u00a9 Copyright 2017 NAHA Return to Topand in hospitals have shown a significant improvement when aromatherapy and essential oils have been used. Essential oils have been shown to improve wound healing, as well as accelerate it, reduce and prevent infections, reduce pain, anxiety, depression and improve self-esteem. The medical community will usually only use treatments that are defined by evidence based practice. Further research is required for the medical community to accept aromatherapy and essential oil use as evidence based practice. Aromatherapy and essential oil use via topically, inhalation and with massage can be incorporated into daily care of the burn victim. References 1. Burns. (2017).

The German folk name for arnica means \"mountain of well-being.\" Arnica has been used for centuries medicinally to reduce pain and inflammation. The Arnica montana plant grows one to two feet in height with vibrant flowers similar to daisies. Stems are round and hairy, ending in one to three flower stalks, with flowers two to three inches across. The upper leaves are toothed and slightly hairy, while lower leaves have rounded tips. The flowers are processed in an infusion to be used as carrier oil, while the roots of the plant are used for homeopathic remedies. The active components of Arnica montana include sesquiterpene lactones and flavonoids, which are known to reduce inflammation and ease pain. It also contains thymol, an essential oil component that fights infection; and carotenoid, a powerful antioxidant. Medicinally, Arnica montana is available in many forms: Infused oil, tincture, homeopathic ointment, cream, salve and pills. Arnica infused oil is a wonderful addition to any first aid kit! You can use it on injuries, sprains, and bruises with unbroken skin. Arnica speeds up the healing process, prompting your body to send more white blood cells to clean up and repair the bruise. Main Uses: Areas of pain and inflammation Fractures and sprains Bruises Strained muscles and tendons Contusions Swelling Add to massage blends. All About Arnica By Shanti Dechen CCAP, CAI, LMT Images this Aromatherapy Journal Autumn 2017.3 \u00a9 Copyright 2017 NAHA Return to TopHow to Make Arnica Infused Oil It is simple to make your own Arnica montana infused oil. The end result is a wonderful carrier oil to use for your essential oil blends and products! STEP 1: Dry the flower heads, herbs or plant material for a day or two. Method: Dry plants by putting them in a basket with a cloth or paper towel in the bottom to soak up any moisture, hang them up to dry, or place them in a paper bag. STEP 2: Once the plant material is dry, you can chop, crush, or grind into small pieces or powder. You can infuse just one type of plant or a combination of plants like arnica (Arnica STEP 3: Place one cup of dried arnica flowers into a pint size glass jar and cover with 1 \u00bd cups of olive (Olea europaea) oil. Fill the jar as far to the top as possible to prevent the infusion from going rancid or molding during the process. Add a label to the jar with the ingredients and date of infusion. Both olive and jojoba (Simmondsia chinensis) oils have a very long shelf life and will not easily go rancid. Olive oil is generally used for infusions of non-aromatic plants. Jojoba oil would be a better choice for delicate aromatic flowers like rose (Rosa x damascena) , chamomile (Matricaria recutita) or lavender (Lavandula angustifolia). STEP 4: This mixture is then left in a dark and warm environment for two to four weeks. If the room temperature is warmer it will infuse quicker. Shake the mixture daily 25-40 times, until the base oil has absorbed the properties and essential nutrients from the plant material. When you see the plant material start to degrade it is time for the next step. STEP 5: Drain off and filter the plant matter, using a funnel and strainer. You can also use an additional paper filter if there are any small particles of plant matter. STEP 6: Bottle and label. It is always best to store the finished product in a dark amber bottle. You can also refrigerate it to extend the shelf life.All About Arnica continued Arnica Topical Healing Blend Ingredients: 1 arnica ( Arnica for Making and Use: Add the arnica-infused oil and the essential oils to a one-ounce glass bottle. Apply a small amount topically as needed to the affected area. If not in use, it is best to refrigerate to extend the shelf life. Cautions: Do not add to the bath, because ginger ( Zingiber officinale ) essential oil is a skin irritant. Do not apply directly to broken skin or open wounds. This is a 3% dilution blend and should be reduced to 1% during pregnancy and for children over 10 years of age. Avoid use with children under 10 years old.Autumn 2017.3 NAHA's Aromatherapy Journal17 \u00a9 Copyright 2017 TopPrecautions for Topical Application of Infused Oil: Do NOT use on wounds or internally. \"Arnica oil contains a compound called helenalin, which may cause allergic reactions in people with sensitivity. If you develop a mild rash while using arnica oil, you are probably helenalin-sensitive and should stop using the oil.\" 1 Broken skin: Don't apply arnica oil to damaged or broken skin. Too much could be absorbed. Allergy to ragweed and related plants: Arnica may cause an allergic reaction in people who are sensitive to the Asteraceae/Compositae family. Members of this family include ragweed, chrysanthemums, marigolds, daisies, and many others. If you have allergies, be sure to check with your healthcare provider before applying it to your skin. Do not take arnica by mouth. Pure arnica oil can be toxic if it gets inside the body, so avoid ingesting it. If taken orally, this herbal oil may cause: Heart irregularities and increased heart rate Nervous disturbances Dizziness, tremors weakness and vomiting Mucous membrane and gastrointestinal irritation.2 References: 1. accessed from: vitamins-supplements-herbs/herbs/arnica/ 2.

Its therapeutic properties are very similar to sweet almond ( Prunus dulcis ) oil. Because my massage therapist had nut allergies, consequently, it stayed in the cupboard for many years. I've since discovered that that was a mistake as it's a wonderful healer for acne; being a very thin oil, it does not clog the pores. The silky consistency of this oil makes it a delight to use it. Far more expensive to produce than almond oil, it reduces the viscosity, and blending the two oils together creates a far easier massage oil consistency for many conditions. Origin of the ApricotSo, where did the apricot originate from? Nobody really knows. Some say from China, that the fruit was carried across the Pontic Steppe by the Scythians on horseback. Others say maybe from India, three thousand years ago, brought to Eastern Europe along the Silk Roads. Legends even say that Noah rescued only one tree, the apricot, from the flood and planted it at the foot of the pyramid shaped Mt. Ararat in Armenia. In fact, the apricot does not appear in either the Bible or rabbinic literature, but certainly, apricots do grow in Armenia, like no place on Earth. Boasting fifty different indigenous varieties, fruit plucked from trees growing at the foot of the mountain are the lushest and plumpest you will ever find. Referred to as \"Kings,\" any apricots sourced from elsewhere in Armenia are good, but not quite the same. These particular ones are known as \"courtiers.\" The Turkish enjoy a celebratory saying when life feels fine: Bundan iyisi am'da kays , the only thing that could be better than this, is an apricot in Damascus. In other words, life is darn near perfect. 1 Since I'm not partial to the taste, I don't foresee myself using the phrase as often as one might! At least, I don't think I like them, but the chances are my experience of the fruit is a shadow of what it could be. British produce harvested before the vitamins and minerals of ripeness have had chance to develop to prolong supermarket shelf life, or canned into overly sweet syrup, potentially taste very different to a juicy drupe plucked fresh, its velvet still warm from the Syrian sun. Pliny tells us the Romans grew them in 100AD and referred to the apricot as \"The Precious One.\" Ancient Greeks knew them as the \"Golden Eggs of the Sun.\" Medieval Arabic medicinal texts cite apricot for fevers and for stomach ache and the ninth century physician Al-Kindi describes how he uses apricots as a preparation for transfusion. Twelfth century philosopher Maimonides advises use of the 20 Aromatherapy Journal Autumn 2017.3 \u00a9 Copyright 2017 NAHA Return to Top\"kernel of a roasted apricot\" as a medication to stiffen the penis.2 Despite their elevated status on the Roman table, apricots seemed not to follow battalions to the West, remaining a secret of the Eastern World for many centuries to come. We know that apricots were in England by the sixteenth century, as documents show Henry VIII's gardener, a Mr. Wolf*, planting one on his estate in 1524. In 1611, the archives of London's royal palace, Hampton Court, show James I paying his head gardener the princely sum of \u00a3100 to plant apricot trees around the walls of the kitchen garden.3 By the seventeenth century, according to Wikipedia,4 apricots had become part of traditional herbal medicine, being used for tumors, ulcers and edema, although so far I have not found original sources to attest to that. *Note: No full is name given in historical references. Derivation of the Name The name apricot is thought, according to William Turner in his New Herbal Parts I & II (1568),5 to come from the Latin word prcoqua / prcocca meaning precocious, because the apricot flowers early in the summer, far earlier than her counterpart, the peach ( , pays testament to its strong Armenian connection, and the genus Prunus tells us it is a stone fruit. Perhaps more romantically, it derives from the genus family name of Rosaceae , so it is related not only to the rose, but also to almond, peach and cherry. The almond relationship becomes more obvious as you get to know the oil. Apricot kernel oil smells like almonds, and it has a bitter and sweet version; the bitter chemotype contains prussic acid that breaks down into hydrogen cyanide. Be warned that the largest cause of people being admitted to hospital for cyanide poisoning is consumption of some form of apricot kernel although, as we will see in a moment, in moderation it is an edible commodity. It shares a connection with peach kernel too; both oils are often referred to as Persic oil in literature, so confusion between the two sources can be rife.Apricot Oil continued TopApricot as a Food Source Famously, apricots are part of the staple diet of the people living in the Pakistani mountainous valley of the Hunza, known for their amazing longevity of life. Their trees are allowed to grow to an enormous size, in order to exploit their maximum potential for fruit. Tiny children scamper like monkeys, nimbly swinging through the upper branches, to collect every last morsel of fruit. By summer, they gorge themselves on the bounty of rich, juicy fruits and lay many of them out in the sun to dry for winter storage. Indeed, dried apricots are soaked in syrup and drunk as the traditional Islamic drink for the feast after sundown for Ramadan. No part of the apricot is wasted. Shells are broken open and used to fuel the fire as the inside is crushed and the rich oil of the kernel oozes, to be used to ignite their lamps and for cooking. A favorite staple of the area is that of crushed kernel (which is like a marzipan-y paste) smeared onto chapattis. The Apricot and China But if apricots originated in the Himalayas, then they found their way to China very early in history; Traditional Chinese Medicine has utilized the apricot kernel for millennia. The Chinese word for apricot means \"place of education\" and it has profound links with learning and gratitude to them. History has it that Confucius would impart his knowledge to students in a grove surrounded by apricot trees and Dong Feng, a physician from the Three Kingdoms Period, is believed to have requested that people plant apricots in his orchard on recovery from their malaise in gratitude of their improvement. The Chinese call their medicine Xing ren - apricot seed, boiling and decocting the kernels. Used as tonics for the large intestine and for lung complaints, they have a bitter, warm and slightly toxic taste. Use of Apricot Apricot kernel's primary use is for generating fluids. 6 On the most fundamental levels we would say that dry skin is moisturized but think also of dry unproductive coughs, constipation,7 when the apricot will moisten the intestines, and for compresses for tired and irritated eyes.8 The oil is rich in linoleic acid, an omega-6 derivative that reduces the skin's permeability Apricot Oil continued Aromatherapy Poultice (to draw swelling bruise) Ingredients: 1 teaspoon apricot kernel for Making and Use: Blend together the carrier oil and the essential oils. Soak a piece of gauze in the blend. Bandage the site of the bruise with the gauze. Leave on overnight so that the blend can bring the bruising and inflammation to the surface. Cautions: Avoid during first 16 weeks of pregnancy or if the client is taking blood thinning medication.22 Aromatherapy Journal Autumn 2017.3 \u00a9 Copyright 2017 NAHA Return to Topto water, harnessing moisture within. Linoleic acid (or vitamin F) plumps the skin, hydrates, heals and protects it. It is also bursting with oleic acid, and consequently it emulsifies the skin's surface. Anti-oxidant, apricot kernel oil calms the speed of cell turnover and invites the granular layer to generate keratinocytes and send them to the surface for a refreshed and more youthful complexion. Research into Apricot Apricot kernel is an under-researched carrier oil so far, but early results show medieval medicine might be correct. In the 1950s, one of its constituents, amygdalin, was touted as an anti-cancer treatment, but it was subsequently branded the claims of quackery. Not all scientists were convinced. In March 2016, laboratories at the University of St Petersburg found that the apricot kernel had, indeed, killed tumors in mice, and it had achieved it via the amygdalin's interaction with a bacteria genome in the tumor. 9 Clearly, the cyanide poisoning issue is a tiny detail that they have yet to overcome to make it into a medicine. It's certainly not home and dry yet, but there may be other cancer avenues that might also be exploited. The high levels of oleic and linoleic acids and lower levels of the vitamin E compound, -tocopherol, seem to boost the immune system and have been proposed as potential weaponry against immune-suppression from chemotherapy drugs. 10 Finally, it has been proven, in animal trials, to contain cardioprotective nutrients that reduce injury as the blood re-enters the heart after myocardial infarcts or heart attacks.11Apricot Oil continued Massage Oil for Bronchitis Apricot oil is blended with the immune boosting properties of sea buckthorn oil and tamanu oil to create a rich oil which is the color of fire opals. Monarda essential oil releases her supercharged levels of thymol and geraniol to calm scar tissue developing in the lungs. Ravensara essential oil eases the cough and alleviates underlying infection. Ingredients: 1 teaspoon apricot kernel for Making and Use: Blend the ingredients together and massage into the upper back, paying special attention to the trapezius and deltoids area which suffer with so much tension from coughing. Cautions: Avoid use before 16 weeks of pregnancy. TopReferences: 1. Acupuncture Today. (n.d.). Apricot Seed (xing ren). Retrieved from: http://www.acupuncturetoday.com/herbcentral/apricot_seed.php 2.

Zochert Abstract An overview of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorders and data is given to demonstrate the current prevalence of ADHD in both children and adults. Connections of ADHD to other comorbidities including anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbances are also reviewed. There is discussion about the possible concerns that some have over the use of medications to treat ADHD and the growing desire for those affected to consider complementary and alternative medical (CAM) options as an alternative to drug therapy. Multiple CAM therapies are presented, and the appropriateness of essential oils to be included as part of those therapies is argued. Although there is insufficient research at this time, the need for more research is supported and possible essential oils for research consideration are examined. Essential Oil Therapy for Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorders (ADHD) The Center of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data collection from 2012-2014 revealed that 10.2% of children between the ages of five and seventeen years of age have been diagnosed with ADHD. 1 Further statistics report the prevalence of ADHD in the U.S. adult population at 4.4%.1 Add to these statistics that the diagnosis of ADHD by medical professionals was reported to increase an average of approximately 5% per year from 2003 to 2011, an alarming 43% increase in US schoolchildren according to data taken from the National survey of Children's Health.3.4 With growing numbers of people being diagnosed with ADHD, it's easy to conclude that the number of people affected by ADHD will continue to increase unless a cause for ADHD can be identified and addressed in the future. In the meantime, there are millions of people throughout the world that are seeking assistance in managing attention deficit disorder and the effect it has on their daily living. Defining ADHD A discussion of possible therapies for assisting in the management of the symptoms of ADHD requires that we understand the definition of ADHD as written by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. To provide further clarification, please note that although the terms ADD and ADHD are often used interchangeably, the current correct medical terminology is ADHD or Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder. 5 Overview of the DSM-5 Medical Classification System for ADHD 6 The DSM-5 primary definition of ADHD is, \"a persistent pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that 26 Aromatherapy Journal Autumn 2017.3 \u00a9 Copyright 2017 NAHA Return to Topinterferes with functioning or development.\" It should be also be noted, in an effort t o accurately reflect the many attributes of ADHD, the DSM-5 further categorizes Attention Deficit/ Hyperactivity Disorder into three subtypes: Predominantly Inattentive Presentation Predominantly Hyperactive/Impulsive Presentation Combined Presentation. Although the etiology of ADHD is largely unknown, there has been significant proof of genetic links between some of the forms of the disorder. 7 Further research identifies differences in brain metabolism, development, and volume in various brain structures in those diagnosed with ADHD. 8 Medication and ADHD Two main types of drugs are prescribed to both children and adults with ADHD; stimulants and non-stimulants. The two classes of drugs work to balance and improve neurotransmitters functioning in the brain and body. However, due to serious possible side effects of drug therapy, many patients and their families are looking for less intrusive methods for helping to manage ADHD symptoms. Increased Use of CAM Modalities in Western Medicine CAM, or complementary and alternative medicine, has its roots in many ancient societies. Similar methodology and herbs can be found in complex medical systems including Chinese medicine, Ayuvedic, Hikmat, and Native American medicine. These therapies are often considered not only to be valid because of their longevity, but the diversity of their use. 7 A push from consumers is forcing medical professionals to look more closely at scientific proof of the effectiveness of complementary and alternative medicine. A combined result of research studies, and information accessibility to consumers via sources such as the internet, has more medical programs incorporating CAM into their offerings for patients. CAM Modalities Used to Treat ADHD Because of the sometimes-concerning side- effects of drug therapy, patients, doctors, and researchers continue to experiment with non-drug therapies to either supplement the effectiveness of medications, or replace them altogether. Alternative treatments for ADHD that have been researched include: Diet, omega-3, probiotics, vitamins, botanicals, aromatherapy, mind-body medicine, Aromatherapy Journal27 \u00a9 Copyright 2017 NAHA Return to Top Essential Oil Therapy for ADHD continued manipulation, yoga, meditation and music therapy, homeopathy, and lifestyle changes. Prevalence of CAM in Treating ADHDIn one survey, parents that have reported using CAM therapies with their children is at 54%, with only 11% of those same parents discussing those therapies with their physicians. 7 This data is in contrast with a study conducted in Australia that details 64% of parents indicated that their pediatricians were aware of their use of CAM treatments with their children. The difference in the number of parents sharing their treatment plans with doctors is an interesting statistic. It lends to the belief that the degree to which parents can feel comfortable admitting to CAM treatments is, at least in part, because of the way they perceive doctors will respond to the information. It would be interesting to have further research conducted to see if there is a correlation between the cultural acceptance of CAM therapies and the percentage of those therapies being shared with doctors. Essential Oils as a Method of Treatment for ADHD Small sample size and the relatively low number of scientific research studies that have been conducted on the effectiveness of using essential oils as a method of treatment, limit the amount of hard data currently available on the subject. However, one just needs to search the web to find that there are hundreds, possibly thousands, of people reporting anecdotal evidence that essential oils are making a difference in their own or their children's ADHD symptoms. Although the study of essential oils and their use in the treatment of ADHD may be limited, there is significant data showing the correlation between mood, emotion, behavior, and neural activity. 9,10,11 The most complete scientific study to date was done in 2001 by Dr. Terry Friedman. The case study was conducted between 1999-2001. It involved forty children between six and twelve years old. Twenty of the children served as a control group and twenty children were diagnosed with ADHD. The essential oils that were used in the study frankincense (Boswellia carteri oils]. The essential oils were tested one at a time for thirty days per essential oil; the children used an inhalation device at night and inhaled the essential oil three times daily when they were feeling \"scattered.\" The children had baseline and post-treatment electroencephalograms (EEGs) to determine the effects of each essential oil on all major areas of the brain and give instant feedback. The EEG measurement only included beta and theta waves. Beta brain waves reflect those waves that are being produced by the brain THIS PAGE: Lavender (Lavandula angustifolia)28 Aromatherapy Journal Autumn 2017.3 \u00a9 Copyright 2017 NAHA Return to Topwhen the subject is alert and/or performing a task. On the other hand, theta waves reflect the brain in the state of sleep or daydreaming, but awake. Interestingly, the initial brain waves measured by the real-time EEG showed there was a difference between the waves of normal children compared to ADHD children. While brain waves from normal children were high in amounts of beta waves and low in the amounts of theta waves during waking hours, the reverse was true in the children diagnosed with ADHD. Subjects were randomly divided into three different groups with six persons per group. For each of the three groups, one of three essential oils were randomly selected. The first of these oils was cedarwood ( Cedrus atlantica); chosen because of its high concentration of sesquiterpenes making up 50% of its constituents, which improves oxygenation of the cells of the brain. 12 The second oil was vetiver ( Vetiveria zizanioides ) whose action calms and balances the nervous system and at the same time stimulates the circulatory system. The third oil was lavender (Lavandula angustifolia) which has both a sedative as well as a stimulating action. It sedates part of the brain at the same time stimulating the limbic region of the brain. Each subject in the study was given a glass bottle of their assigned essential oil to administer at home. Six subjects were given cedarwood essential oil, six were given vetiver essential oil, and six were given lavender essential oil. The subjects were asked to inhale the essential oil three times a day, using an inhalation technique that involved holding the open bottle next to the nostrils and taking three deep inhalations. At the end of thirty days, the subjects were asked to return to the clinic where they were retested on the real-time EEG. Treatment outcome results revealed that the essential oil of vetiver improved the brain activity and reduced the symptoms in ADHD diagnosed subjects by 32%. Similar results were found with the cedarwood essential oil. In the end, vetiver essential oil was found to improve the symptoms of 100% of the children studied, while cedarwood essential oil resulted in improvement for 83%, and lavender essential oil resulted in improvement for 5%. In addition to the EEG results, it is compelling to note that Dr. Friedman received follow up from parents of the children with ADHD stating that their behavior at home had improved for the better. In several cases, they also declared that school educators observed improved classroom performance as well. Some of the subjects even had reflections of this improvement in their report cards. 12Essential Oil Therapy for ADHD continued Autumn 2017.3 Return to TopHeather Godfrey11 interviewed parents and therapists of boys, ages eleven to twelve years of age, to gather their impressions on the effects of essential oil treatment and ADHD. The boys chose three essential oils each; these essential oils were blended with vegetable oil to use for self-administration during class. The self-administration involved one drop of blended oil rubbed on the wrist and it was initially used in conjunction with relaxation exercises. The blend could also be used in a bath at home. The connection seemed to be one of using the scent as a connection to positive memory cues to help students. The parents interviewed reported that although the oils helped to \"calm\" the boys, they did not decrease the underlying ADHD symptoms. Godfrey also reported that of the families using oils, the method of use was: 75% diffusion, 50% bath, 50% massage. In the end, the results showed 75% of them found essential oils to be effective and 50% found them to be calming. 11 Godfrey provided a variety of essential oils for testing which included: Blue gum eucalyptus (Boswellia carteri ). How to Choose Essential Oils for Treatment When considering the different types of ADHD as defined by the DSM-5, it is appropriate to reflect upon the profiles of individual essential oils, their chemical and emotional properties, and the input of the person who will be using them. These characteristics should be noted and the obtained information applied to choose those essential oils that may most closely achieve the desired outcome. A recent article written by Haly JensenHof, BS, MA, PC, RA, 13 points out the crossover of many symptoms of anxiety disorders and ADHD. The diagnosis of anxiety as a comorbidity of ADHD is very common. In fact, there are studies that put the dual diagnosis of ADHD and anxiety at 25%. 14 This information supports the appropriateness of trying essential oils that treat anxiety for those diagnosed with ADHD. Essential Oils to Consider for Further Testing Basil ( Ocimum basilicum ) essential oil is reported to help with anxiety, depression, fatigue, insomnia, and nervous tension. Cedarwood ( Cedrus atlantica) essential oil was found to be very effective in Dr. Friedman's study and he recommended its use if vetiver essential oil was not available. Cedarwood essential oil is sedative to the nervous system, a stimulant to the circulatory system and a tonic. It is very effective at helping with nervous tension and stress-related conditions. Its uplifting, grounding qualities make it a terrific option. Essential Oil Therapy for ADHD continued30 Aromatherapy Journal Autumn 2017.3 \u00a9 Top Frankincense (Boswellia carteri ) essential oil is sedative and a tonic. Frankincense essential oil helps with anxiety, nervous tension, and stress related conditions. It is often used to help with meditation and relaxation and it can assist in deeper, slower breathing. Lavender (Lavandula officinalis) essential oil is an easily located essential oil that works as a sedative as well as a stimulant. It has been shown to help with depression, hypertension, insomnia, nervous tension, and stress. Its calming, relaxing, and balancing qualities make it a good overall choice for many needs. Marjoram (Origanum marjorana ) essential oil has actions that are sedative, tonic, and nervine. It is helpful in treating insomnia, nervous tension, and stress-related conditions. Rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis ) essential oil has nervous system and mental stimulating qualities. It helps with memory and mental clarity, in addition to being a tonic to the nervous system. It is often found to be useful when studying and can help with recall of information. Vetiver (Vetiveria zinzanoides) essential oil is calming, grounding, sedative to the nervous and mental system, a tonic, and it is uplifting. It helps with depression, insomnia, and nervous tension. It is known as the \"oil of tranquility.\" Ylang Ylang ( Cananga odorata ) essential works as a regulator to mood, it is sedative to the nervous system, stimulating to the circulatory system, and it is a tonic. It has strong sedative, soothing, and calming qualities. It assists with depression, insomnia, nervous tension, and stress-related disorders. Lemongrass essential oils are both extracted from aromatic grasses, and they are similar in their therapeutic properties to vetiver essential oil, yet their aromas are more citrus-y. Further studies of these two essential oils should be considered to see if they are as effective as vetiver essential oil in the treatment of ADHD. Conclusion The results of Dr. Friedman and Ms. Godfrey's studies, the increasing number of people being diagnosed with ADHD, and the desire of patients to have alternative treatments to drug therapy all support the need for further scientific studies on the use of essential oils in the treatment of ADHD symptoms. ADHD is considered non-curable, but symptoms may be improved with combinations of nutrition, cognitive/behavioral therapies, and other CAM modalities. For those interested in non-drug alternatives for managing ADHD symptoms, the known Essential Oil Therapy for ADHD continued Autumn 2017.3 NAHA's Aromatherapy Journal31 \u00a9 Copyright 2017 NAHA Return to Topeffects of essential oils on the central nervous system, as well as providing relaxation, mental clarity, focus, and emotional support, qualify aromatherapy as a strong addition to the arsenal of therapies available to minimize the effects of ADHD on daily functionality.

I'd enter the doors of my local department store shortly after the fourth of July, just to be blindsided with school supplies and large signs with pencils on them. The words \"Back to School\" glared at me and my heart would start pounding. Part of me was sad to leave behind the summer fun, but part of me was giddy with excitement. A new school year meant new students, new supplies, and a fresh new start. The teacher in me was ready to embark on this new adventure. But as with every new beginning comes some transitional difficulties. For children who slept in all summer, it can be a rude awakening to hear the alarm clock blaring at 6:00 a.m. Nervousness over a new school or teacher can cause their minds to become cluttered with worry, making it difficult to sleep throughout the night. Parents are now looking for natural options to assist their child to get a good night's sleep allowing them to conquer the day. In this article, we will look at sleep issues regarding the start of a new school year and how aromatherapy can assist in children aged 5-12 years old.General Safety Considerations I have chosen gentle yet effective essential oils to discuss in this article. Children really don't need chemically reactive essential oils to bring their body back to balance. A gentle push is all that is needed. Essential oils should be used cautiously and with intention when it comes to children. Involve them in the process of choosing an essential oil blend so that they gain respect for these potent botanical remedies. If you educate yourself on safe usage, essential oils can be a powerful tool to keep your family happy and healthy. The Bedtime Battle The recommended sleep time for this age group (5-12 years old) ranges from 10-12 hours a night. Adequate sleep is necessary to maintain optimal health. It directly impacts physical and emotional development. In order for students to successfully process and develop their academic skills, they need proper sleep. Essential oils should not be used as a crutch to lull children to sleep every night. However, if the child is having difficulty sleeping for short periods of time, essential oils boast sedative qualities which can relax and Aromatherapy and Sleep Issues in Children During the School Year By Amy Emnett, CCA, CNHP 34 Aromatherapy Journal Autumn 2017.3 \u00a9 Copyright 2017 NAHA Return to Tophelp them settle down for a good night's sleep. Some kid-friendly suggested essential oils are: Petitgrain bigarade (Citrus aurantium var. amara (fol)) essential oil is derived from the leaves of the bitter orange tree. It has a woodsy orange aroma with a hint of floral. It is high in linalool and linalyl acetate which research has shown to have a sedative effect on the central nervous system. 1 It can stop a racing mind and relieve feelings of anxiety and stress. It is great for the child who cannot turn off his/her brain at night. Green mandarin (Citrus reticulata) essential oil has a sweet and fruity aroma and it is derived from a fruit rind. Green mandarin tends to be the most calming of the citrus essential oils. Children especially love the fact that the drops come out green! Like all of the citrus essential oils, it is uplifting and offers immune support due to its high percentage of d-limonene. 2 It is fantastic to help one to settle down, especially when combined with essential oils of a gentle, calming nature, such as lavender ( Lavandula angustifolia) and Roman chamomile (Chamaemelum nobile). atlantica) essential oil has a mild, woodsy aroma. It is derived from the wood of the cedar tree and it offers a sense of grounding. It calms fears and builds confidence. I have found this essential oil to be helpful for the child who has nightmares or who is afraid of the dark. It is very powerful for those who have difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep. The Repeat Snoozer Some children, especially as they get older, have more difficulty in getting out of bed in the morning. They tend to repeatedly hit the snooze button and moan and groan as you try to convince them to awake from their beloved slumber. Simply drop these essential oils in their bedroom diffuser to get them up and moving. Pink grapefruit (Citrus x paradisi) essential oil has a sweet yet tangy aroma derived from the fruit rind. It is almost impossible not to get up and move when diffusing this essential oil. It is cheerful and makes you feel more alert. It is like a burst of energy in a bottle. It is helpful to get a child out of their slumber with a smile on their face and ready to tackle the day. Peppermint (Mentha x piperita) is the quintessential energizing essential oil. Its strong mental aroma stimulates the senses 3 and reduces feelings of fatigue. It promotes clarity while awakening a sluggish child who can't seem get a jumpstart on the morning's activities. It motivates and refreshes. It adds an element of vibrancy and positive dynamics to any situation.Aromatherapy and Sleep Issues in Children continued Autumn 2017.3 NAHA's Aromatherapy Journal35 \u00a9 Copyright 2017 NAHA (Citrus aurantifolia) essential oil has a radiant, sweet and sparkling citrus aroma. I have found that a quality steam-distilled (not expressed) lime essential oil is reminiscent of a lime Popsicle. Children really resonate with its candy-like scent. It is almost like having a sugar rush without having to ingest sugar! It's a bottle of sunshine and it can lift a child out of a funk quickly and effectively. Methods of ApplicationI recommend inhalation of an essential oil blend as the primary delivery method for the issues we are addressing in this article. Inhalation is safe, simple, and effective. One word of caution regarding inhalation: Let the child inhale the cap of an essential oil bottle first and gauge their reaction. If it instills a negative response, disregard using this essential oil with the child. This applies to both physical and emotional responses. If they don't enjoy the aroma, they definitely won't find it calming or a cheerful start to their day! The wonderful thing about essential oils is that they are all so multifaceted and there are many essential oils to choose from. The sky's the limit! One way to utilize essential oils is by using an aromastick. Aromasticks are personal and portable. Children can keep them in their desk or book bag and bring them out when needed. Place around ten drops of an essential oil onto an organic cotton wick. (I recommend organic, since cotton is a heavily pesticide-sprayed crop.) Then, place the cotton wick in a vented tube with the lid on to keep the aroma trapped in the tube. You simply untwist and inhale when needed. Easy and effective! Another easy way that children can benefit from essential oils is by wearing diffusing jewelry. One advantage of wearing jewelry is that it on their body, allowing easy access. They can simply bring it to their nose to inhale when needed. Only one drop on the provided disc is needed for a necklace. The aroma usually lasts for days. For lava bead bracelets, apply the essential oil with a cotton swab directly to the lava bead and wait for it to be fully absorbed before placing the bracelet on your child. The last method of use is room diffusion through an ultrasonic diffuser. Simply place a few drops of an essential oil into the water reservoir and turn it on. Refer to the manufacturer's instructions for use for specific quantities and how to use it. Diffuse for 15-20 minutes then turn it off for at least an hour. Continuous diffusion is not recommended nor is it more effective than intermittent diffusion. If your child is battling an issue that requires an extra push, then choose diffusing intermittently more often during the day, rather than running the diffuser continuously. For example, if they are battling a cold, it is better to diffuse for fifteen minutes every couple hours than for two hours continuously.

Not only can it support the physical body, but it can provide emotional support to the child who needs a little extra TLC. Using botanical remedies with your children can create bonding experiences and foster lasting memories. Teach your children about the power of plants to enhance their lives and you have given them invaluable wisdom to pass down to future generations. References: 1.

This most unassuming herb of the plant world does, in fact, possess a great many characteristics but it is its association with memory that we will be looking at more closely in this article. We will discover that rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis) essential oil metabolizes into several variations with regard to its essential oil constituents, and understanding each of these variations can help us to use it to its fullest potential. Cognitive performance can be affected in any stage of life, sometimes reduced by stressful events, or simply by the effect of aging. But although memory loss is a distressing condition that affects a great many people, to varying degrees, it hits most cruelly when our bodies (and minds) age. Synthetic drugs have limited use in this area of study. However, clinical studies in the use of rosemary essential oil is producing some encouraging results in how this plant might be able to help.Botanical Spotlight on Rosemary Rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis) is a member of the Lamiaceae plant family. A perennial woody herb, with highly aromatic leaves, rosemary is an evergreen shrub which produces lavender-blue or pink-lavender flowers. Although it traditionally flowers in the spring, it can be an early bloomer in the garden (as early as December in warmer climates) and may produce flowers outside of its traditional flowering season. Rosemary is indigenous to the Mediterranean region but it grows in any comparable climate. In my garden in northern Arizona, I have seen this shrub flourish both under hot and wet conditions. Rosemary has spiky, green, needle-shaped leaves which are reminiscent of fir needles in shape. Both the leaves and flowering tops are harvested and distilled for use as an essential oil. Essential Oil ChemotypesRosemary has traditionally produced three main chemotypes: ct. and NAHA Return to TopA chemotype is the different internal chemical composition of a plant; its external appearance, and the genus and species, appear the same. Essentially a chemotype is a subspecies of a plant.4 This means that some plants, when extracted for essential oil, produce a malady of chemical compositions, producing a variance in therapeutic properties of an essential oil. These changes may occur naturally in the wild or they may be the result of cross-pollination. Other factors which affect the variance in chemotypes in a plant include the elevation at which the plant was grown, the growing conditions of the plant, climate, and various environmental factors. 5 It can even depend on the time of collection of the rosemary plant for distillation. 6 A few plants, such as rosemary, seem to have a tendency towards this variance of chemical constituents.Rosemary as an Essential Oil Rosemary essential oil has a fresh, camphoraceous aroma (depending on the chemotype) with subtle undertones of mint. It typically contains the following chemical components; the names in bold represent the various chemotypes of cuminic aldehyde.3 Table 1 shows the typical chemotype content for each chemotype.The Use of Rosemary Essential Oil with Memory Issues continued Table 1: Rosemary Chemotypes and Typical Chemotype Content Chemotype Typical Chemotype Content Elhassan 11.5 and Camphor Up to 30% Price and Price, 2012; Tisserand and Young, 2014 Cineole 40 - 60% Price and Price, 2012; Tisserand and Young, 2014 Myrcene 19.5 - 52.1% Tisserand and Young, 2014 Pinene 15 - 35% Price and Price, 2012** 19.1 - 35.8% Tisserand and Young, 2014 Verbenone 15 - 40% Price and Price, 2012* 7.6 - 12.3% Tisserand and Young, 2014* * This appears to be a wide fluctuation in percentage content but remember that each batch of essential oil tested has various factors which may affect its content (as discussed above). ** Pinene is listed under ct. verbenone TopThe Relevance of the Many Chemotypes Present in Rosemary Essential Oil With so many chemotypes to choose from when purchasing rosemary essential oil, subject to availability, how do you know which one is most suitable for your needs? As we discussed at the start of this article, we are predominately looking at the suitability of using rosemary essential oil with seniors and memory problems. However, before we look at this area more closely, take a look at Table 2 which is a summary of the various chemotypes and their expected therapeutic actions.The Use of Rosemary Essential Oil with Memory Issues continued Table 2: Rosemary Chemotypes and Their Expected Therapeutic Action Chemotype Chemical Family Expected Therapeutic Action Borneol Alcohols Stimulating, antiviral, anticatarrhal, expectorant, mucolytic, cicatrisant. Dementia and Alzheimer's Disease Dementia is an umbrella name applied to a number of symptoms associated with memory loss. The most common type of memory loss is Alzheimer's disease.7 Symptoms of dementia include: increasing memory loss increased difficulty in communicating effectively inability to focus increasing unreasonableness increased agitation increased anxiety lack of judgment decreased visual perception. 40 Aromatherapy Journal Autumn 2017.3 \u00a9 Copyright 2017 NAHA Return to TopAlthough most people who suffer with dementia do so after the age of sixty-five, five percent of the population incur \"early onset\" dementia.8 Symptoms worsen over time. It may start with forgetting where you placed an object, increasing to inability to remember to pay bills on time, to forgetting how to find your way back home from a previously familiar route. Increased agitation and change in mood (aggressiveness) may follow in the latter stages of the disease and it is a very difficult disease for caregivers to watch how a loved one deteriorates. I experienced this first hand when I was working in social care in the UK many years ago, and worked in assisting caregivers obtain financial assistance for much needed help for their loved ones. Clinical Studies with Rosemary Essential Oil: Memory in General The use of rosemary essential oil with memory loss and, in particular, Alzheimer's disease, has produced positive results in various clinical studies. Unfortunately, many of these studies fail to mention which particular chemotype of rosemary essential oil was used. One study suggested increased alertness and lower anxiety scores when rosemary essential oil was given to the study group. 9 The study group also completed math computations more accurately and more quickly than the study group who were given lavender (Lavandula angustifolia) essential oil. Another study also showed similar results. 10 Clinical Studies with Rosemary Essential Oil: 1,8-cineole One particular study concluded that \"compounds absorbed from rosemary aroma affect cognition and subjective state independently through different neurochemical pathways.\" 11 Improved cognitive performance was recorded at higher levels of exposure. Clinical Studies with Rosemary Essential Oil: Alzheimer's Disease A positive and encouraging study concluded that there was \"some potential\" for aromatherapy in helping to improve cognitive function in Alzheimer's disease patients. 12 In the study, rosemary and lemon (Citrus x limon) essential oils were used in the morning, followed by lavender and orange (species not specified) essential oils in the evening. Results showed a \"significant improvement in personal orientation related to cognitive function.\" Conclusions and RecommendationsIn summary, given the information obtained in these studies, and our understanding of rosemary essential oil and its various chemotypes, it can be seen that rosemary essential oil has potential to assist in a form of The Use of Rosemary Essential Oil with Memory Issues continued Autumn 2017.3 NAHA's Aromatherapy Journal41 \u00a9 Copyright 2017 NAHA Return to TopThe Use of Rosemary Essential Oil with Memory Issues continued a holistic care package for someone suffering with memory loss. Rosemary essential oil, in general, is a stimulating essential oil and the various chemical components found within it, seem to indicate it is successful in stimulating memory and increasing cognitive function within certain environments. Indeed, one study indicated that ct. 1,8-cineole was successful in affecting cognitive awareness. It would appear to me that all chemotypes of rosemary essential oil would produce a stimulating effect, although some to a greater degree than other depending upon individual chemical components. The decision between each chemotype may depend upon if there are other issues to address with a patient as well; for example, respiratory issues. The time of day at which the rosemary essential oil is used may also affect the choice of chemotype used; for example, ct. verbenone may be more useful at bed time than in the morning. I would also consider alternating rosemary essential oil with an \"opposite\" blend of essential oils, i.e. a calming blend. This method Memory Booster Diffusion Blend Essential Oils: 25 drops rosemary ct. camphor (Rosmarinus officinalis) 30 Directions for Making and Use: Add the following essential oils to a 5mL glass bottle. Add an orifice reducer to the bottle, cap, and shake well. Add approximately five drops of the blend to an aromatherapy diffuser, following the manufacturer's guidelines for use. Diffuse for twenty minutes in the morning. Cautions: This is an extremely potent blend. Avoid use around babies and young children under the age of five years, around pets, in pregnancy, or around those with specific health conditions such as high blood pressure and epilepsy. Do not diffuse longer than the specified time, and reduce if necessary. Consult a certified aromatherapist for further advice. *Sage has also been shown to be effective to boost memory performance.13Breathe Calmly Bed Time Spray Ingredients: 2 oz. distilled water 1 tsp grain-free alcohol Essential Oils: 8 drops Valeriana faurieri ) Directions for Making and Use: Combine all of the ingredients and essential oils in a spray bottle.

It may be difficult to get a patient with memory loss to apply an aromatherapy blend on a regular basis, due to change in mood and memory, so a caregiver may wish to try diffusing the essential oil blend as an alternative. Having watched my grandfather slip slowly away into the world of Alzheimer's disease when I was in my early 20's and taking my finals at college, I only wish I had known then what I know now about the use of aromatherapy. Although research is in its infancy with how aromatherapy can be used with debilitating diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, the potential for using rosemary essential oil in this capacity is promising.

Autumn 2017.3 to TopThe Myrtaceae Plant Family by Cheryl Murphy, Certified Aromatherapist The Myrtaceae plant family is a group of plants composed of over 3,300 species, consisting mainly of trees and shrubs found in the tropics, subtropics and temperate Australia. 1 Many species have aromatic, leathery leaves, containing oil glands, and flowers of white, pink, red, purple or yellow. Species of the Myrtaceae plant family provide many valuable products including timber, ornamental plants, food products (including spices) and essential oils. Guava, cloves and allspice are commonly used for culinary purposes. Many plants from this family are used in landscaping, the most common being common myrtle (Myrtus communis) an evergreen shrub. Incidentally, the popular crepe myrtle tree ( Lagerstroemia indica) is a member of the Lythraceae plant family. Historically, the Myrtaceae plant family was very important to the Aboriginal people. These indigenous people collected water and grubs from the roots of certain trees and the wood and bark of some species were used to make tools, utensils, bowls, canoes, shields and weapons. 2 The Myrtaceae Plant Family in Aromatherapy The most common essential oils from the Myrtaceae plant family are steam distilled from the leaves and branches of the plant and are stimulating and good for the respiratory system. 3 This group of essential oils is excellent for various types of skin conditions and is useful in the treatment of muscular aches/ pains as well as coughs, colds, and flu. Due to the antibacterial and antifungal properties of many of these oils, they are often included in natural cleaning products for the home. Essential oils extracted from the Myrtaceae plant family are quite affordable and versatile and can be used in a variety of aromatherapy applications. However, caution must be used due to the chemical composition of some oils. Some Essential Oils from the Myrtaceae Plant Family Editor's Note: Avoid any of these essential oils if they are old or oxidized, particularly tea tree (Melaleuca alternifolia) essential oil.

Beautiful, intoxicating, warming, and soothing. On the days when I can feel the autumn chill in my body, I am sure to make a cup or two of fresh ginger tea with lemon and honey. I have also been using a ginger salt scrub every other day along with organic vanilla-infused jojoba (Simmondsia chinensis) , made with vanilla a 2.5% dilution of cardamom (Elettaria (Zingiber officinale ) is a herbaceous perennial of about one meter in height, with large long grass-like leaves developing from a branched rhizome. The flowers occur in a dense, scaly spike on an elongated stalk. Each flower has three yellowish orange petals with an additional purplish, lip-like structure. 1Ginger is considered to be the most ancient spice known to humankind and has been used as food, medicine, and a spice. It enjoys a long history of use in China, India, Japan, and throughout Asia. The ancient Greeks and Romans held ginger in high regard for its medicinal and culinary uses. Ginger is a member of the Zingiberaceae family which includes over forty-eight genera and 1200 species including cardamom and turmeric (Curcuma longa). This is a highly aromatic family of plants, with most being prized for their exotic spicy aromas and tastes. Ginger is thought to have occurred wild throughout the East Asian crescent spanning South China, Vietnam, Malaysia and Indonesia.

Close your eyes and hold a bottle of ginger essential oil close enough to your nose to be able to smell, waft the bottle to the left and right; inhale, observe, feel. Notice its aroma, its effects on your mind/ body/emotions. Then clear your nasal palate by taking a few inhalations of fresh ground coffee or coffee beans. Next, take a few moments to cut into the fresh ginger rhizome, close your eyes, and hold the cut piece of ginger under your nose, wafting it from left to right; take a few inhalations. Take a moment to observe its aroma and aromatic impact on your mind/body/emotions. Take another moment to smell the fresh piece of ginger. Then clear the nasal palate by inhaling ground coffee or coffee beans again. Now: Repeat this process with the essential oil again. Close your eyes and hold the bottle of ginger essential underneath your nose. Waft the bottle to the left and to the right; inhale, observe, feel. What differences do you note? How did smelling the fresh ginger enhance your perceptions of the ginger essential oil? Ginger Chemistry Ginger rhizome contains 4-10% oleoresin pungent principles, specifically: Gingerol, gingerdiones, and shogaols. The essential oil is typically obtained via distillation of dried ginger root. Dried ginger root has a 1.0 to 3.3% essential oil content comprised mostly of sesquiterpenes supported by monoterpenes. Main sesquiterpene components components include: b-phellandrene and camphene. The essential oil of ginger does not contain the bitter principal components; however the CO 2 extract does. The CO2 extract of ginger Ginger (Zingiber 18-23% pungent components, making the Co2 extract more heating and diaphoretic than the essential oil. Western Therapeutic Applications: Ginger has traditionally been used for its antispasmodic, carminative, and diaphoretic properties. As both a herb preparation (tincture, infusion, powdered extract) and essential oil it is used to relieve motion sickness and nausea. Ginger is used to stimulate digestion, expectorate mucus/ phlegm from the lungs, and it is indicated for use with: Flatulence, dyspepsia, colds, loss of appetite, menstrual cramps, amenorrhoea, dysmenorrhoea, nausea, and as an adjunct for arthritis and pain relief. It is used as an anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic for dysmenorrhea, uterine fibroids, and chronic pelvic pain. It is also beneficial as an antianorectic due to appetite loss associated with cancer and HIV chemotherapeutic treatments. 3 Pharmacological data and experimental data indicate two potential uses of ginger: Antiemetic and anxiolytic/antidepressant. 4 Core therapeutic circulatory stimulant, anti-inflammatory, diaphoretic, digestive stimulant. Ginger and Ayurveda MedicineIn Ayurvedic medicine ginger is the universal medicine and can be of benefit to all. It is specifically indicated for vta disorders. Ginger destroys toxins, is a digestive, prevents nausea, enkindles the digestive fire, reduces feelings of cold, is rejuvenating, alleviates cough and breathing difficulties, and alleviates Ginger (Zingiber officinale) continued Soothe Away Anxiety ( 4 mandarin ( Citrus reticulata) Directions for Making and Use: Mix the synergy of essential oils together in a small bowl, then soak an inhaler pad in the essential oils.

Like Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), Ayurveda distinguishes between dried and fresh ginger. Dried ginger is called Sunthi and fresh ginger is called Ardraka. Uses of Fresh and Dry Ginger in Ayurveda Medicine Dry ginger clears ma from plasma and blood (for information on ma check the resources list at the end of this article). Dry ginger clears phlegm in kapha-vta coughs and colds. Fresh ginger increases peripheral circulation and causes vasodilation and sweating. Dry ginger increases agni and the secretion of digestive enzymes. Useful for nausea including morning sickness,* post-operative nausea, and travel sickness. Fresh ginger hot tea can be used to relieve menstrual cramps. Dry ginger, which is more heating then fresh ginger, can aggravate pitta. *See contraindications listed below. Ginger and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) Both fresh and dried ginger are officinal drugs of the modern Chinese pharmacopeia. It is one of the most widely used medicinal herbs and it is believed to be used in half of all herbal prescriptions in modern China. Traditional Chinese Medicine distinguishes clearly between dried and fresh ginger. Dried ginger (Gan-jiang) is used to treat yang deficiencies: \"It is more effective in expelling Interior Cold , which is related more to the constitution of the patient while fresh ginger ( Sheng-jiang ) promotes seating and disperses Exterior Cold which is brought on by external factors.\" 5 Fresh ginger root is used to dispel pathogens via its ability to induce sweating. It expels cold, relieves nausea and clears toxic matter from the body. It is used for common colds due to pathogenic Wind Cold. Dried ginger root is used to treat depleted Yang and alleviates Cold conditions characterized by pallor, poor appetite and digestion, vomiting, cold limbs, pale tongue, or thin, watery or white sputum. 5 Use for Yang exhaustion syndromes with severe chilliness, slow pulse, and aching. The essential oil of ginger warms the interior and dispels cold. 6 It warms the Lung and transforms phlegm, warms and opens the meridians and blood vessels (indicated for scanty menstrual flow, amenorrhea, spasmodic dysmenorrhea) and Warms the Kidney and fortifies Yang (indicated when there is frigidity, impotence, cold extremities, fatigue, or diarrhea). Dosages of the herb: 7 Tea: 1 tbsp. grated fresh root per one cup of boiling water, 3 to 4 cups daily. Powder: 1 to 2 grams daily.. Tincture: 1.5 to 5ml three times per day.Ginger Aroma of Ginger: Psychological and Spiritual Effects Ginger's aroma is warm, spicy, and woody with a hint of lemongrass and varying degrees of sweetness. Ginger's warm spicy sweet aroma offers the individual strength during times of depletion or loss of motivation. Ginger promotes clarity by \"detoxing\" negative or toxic thoughts and energy. As a root essential oil, ginger is also grounding and provides strength to move forward. Ginger provides deep warmth and stimulation on the physiological level while its aroma (fragrance) works deeply into the psyche, bringing energy and strength to some of the deepest sources of our power. Ginger can be an ally in the process of self-empowerment, giving us the strength to meet life's challenges with an adequate vital response. 6 The warming nature of ginger sustains and then rebuilds where there has been a loss of energy on the physical and emotional levels. 8 Ginger essential oil can restore determination and help to boost confidence and morale. It is indicated for those who may have clear plans and good intentions, but who lack the personal drive and optimism to manifest initiative and take real or immediate action. Ginger can be a catalyst of the Will (Zhi), invoking and enhancing ones vital fire. 9 Ginger (Zingiber officinale) continued Warming Body Oil Ingredients: 1 oz.

It is a day for counting your blessings, sharing your bountiful harvest and for celebrating your abundance. One of the most well-known \"Thanksgiving Day\" celebrations is in the United States with its tradition of a festive dinner table set with candles and laden with turkey, pumpkin pie and all of the delightful trimmings associated with a bountiful harvest. Prayers of gratitude and giving thanks are common practices among all people in all of the world's cultures. Most frequently held after the end of the harvest season, thanksgiving ceremonies have ritually been celebrated at various times throughout human history. Thanksgiving is a practice that has evolved over time, many of its roots pre-date written history. Throughout its known heritage, a day of giving thanks always has aspects of harvest, as well as of celebration. It is also a time of remembrance for what has been and what is to come. Honoring the cycle of life and its renewal through time is a key theme in every Thanksgiving celebration. Practice of Abundance Most especially, Thanksgiving is a practice of abundance. It is a day of sharing one's bounty with others and, through sharing one's bounty, your harvest is multiplied. An example of this continuance of life though the practice of abundance in time can be found in the tradition of \"Thanksgiving Day\" practiced by Americans, which itself is rooted in English traditions dating back to the early 1500s.\u00b9 First Thanksgiving StoriesThere are numerous stories about how the \"First Thanksgiving\" started in many of the world's present day harvest celebrations. The most famous story in the United States is from a group of Pilgrims, who were out game hunting. The story goes that the neighboring Wampanoag natives, hearing gunshots, thought that the English might be preparing for war. The leader of the tribe, Massasoit, visited the Englishmen's settlement and discovered that the English men were simply out game hunting for their harvest celebration. To help them out, Massasoit offered to send men from his own tribe to hunt and provide meat and deer for their feast. Of course, the Wampanoag tribe members were invited as guests to the harvest celebration. There were ninety Wampanoag tribe members and fifty three Pilgrims at the \"First Thanksgiving\" day harvest celebration.\u00b2 Canada has two popular \"First Thanksgiving\" stories. The first recounts how, in 1578, the explorer Martin Frobisher held the first 60 Aromatherapy Journal Autumn 2017.3 \u00a9 Copyright 2017 NAHA Return to TopThanksgiving Day celebration in Canada for surviving his long journey from England. He had undergone much hardship on his journey through the wilderness in his attempt to find a passageway to the Pacific ocean.\u00b2 The second story cites the origin of the Canadian \"First Thanksgiving\" to early French settlers who in the beginning of the 17th century arrived with the famous explorer Samuel de Champain in New France. The French settlers were reported to celebrate all successful harvests, typically at the end of the growing season. The celebrations usually continued throughout the entire winter season. The French settlers were known for sharing their bountiful harvest with the local indigenous peoples of the region. This tradition of celebrating harvest and sharing your abundance with others continued and it was adopted by all of the new immigrants arriving in Canada. Each of these new arrivals, be they German, Irish, Scottish, or of any other nationality, added their own traditions to the Thanksgiving Day feast, including the American turkey which arrived with the Loyalists who fled the United States during the American Revolution. Until recently, Thanksgiving has always been observed on various months and days throughout history even in the United States. Up to the time of United States President Abraham Lincoln (1809 - 1865), the date for observing Thanksgiving always differed from state to state. So, historically anytime of harvest was seen as a good time for a Thanksgiving celebration and practicing abundance. Thanksgiving Celebration OilsYou might say that Thanksgiving is a celebration of the senses. Full enjoyment of the senses and sharing that enjoyment with others is at the heart of every Thanksgiving celebration. What better way to celebrate the senses than with aromatic oils. Scent reaches deeply into the human psyche stirring your memories in mysterious and wondrous ways. Thanksgiving blends contain many of the essential oils often used in traditional wealth attraction formulas. The use of plant aromatics to attract prosperity has been practiced for thousands of years by some of the world's most wealthy cultures. The essential oils in the Thanksgiving Celebration Blends recipes are mood enhancers and aphrodisiacs which promote you experiencing good feelings and an aura of attraction about you. As in today's celebrations, social gatherings, festivals and celebrations of antiquity were often opportunities for courtship and meeting one's prospective marriage partner.Essential Oils for the Thanksgiving Celebration continued Autumn 2017.3 NAHA's Aromatherapy Journal61 \u00a9 Copyright 2017 NAHA Return to TopEssential Oils for the Thanksgiving Celebration continued Cinnamon Leaf (Cinnamomum zeylanicum).

Essential oils, stored in the tiny secretory structures of plants, require a large amount of plant material, up to 100 times or more, to make one tiny bottle of oil. For those plants whose population is dwindling to the point of scarcity, it is unethical to harvest and produce oils in a way that jeopardizes their earthly existence. This article will focus on identifying and describing specific plant species used for making essential oils that are in serious risk of over harvesting. Below is a list of plants which have species or subspecies in danger. Visit the websites listed at the end of this article for more detailed and up-to-date information before purchasing essential oils extracted from these botanicals. It is the duty of a responsible consumer to reduce the demand on vulnerable species. Frankincense ( Boswellia sacra, B. frereana and Other Boswellia classified as \"Near Threatened\" on the 2017.1 IUCN Red List. 1 This sacred tree is found in Northern Somalia, Oman, and Yemen. 2 In some areas, like Oman, it is \"Critically Endangered.\"3 Several Boswellia species located in Yemen have a dangerously declining habitat and were listed as \"Vulnerable\" on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species in 2017, such as B. ameero, B. bullata, Main Essential Oil Species of Concern 64 Aromatherapy Journal Autumn 2017.3 \u00a9 Copyright 2017 NAHA Return B. popoviana, and B. socotrana .4 B. ovalifoliolata from India and B. ogadensis from Ethiopia are also vulnerable.5,6 This tree resin has been a highly valuable plant extract since ancient times, with the Horn of Africa trading it as a lucrative commodity for 2,000 years. 7 Today, it is used in Western medicine for inflammation, and as an anti-carcinogenic.8 Further studies indicate that it may be effective in treating bladder cancer.9 It is harvested by precisely cutting into the bark and allowing the resin to slowly ooze out and then solidify, with the cuttings repeated two or three times in the five month harvest season. 7 Boswellia papyrifera genetic variety is dwindling in Western Ethiopia and conservation strategies need to be implemented.10 Somililand, which is not technically a country, is an area where frankincense is especially overharvested and under protected. Here, the resin is purchased from the harvester by a middleman for an extremely low price, then sold in the Middle East for a much higher price to an international market. Thus, the Somali farmer is exploited with no government control of frankincense sales. Rising food prices and scarce opportunity for other jobs in the area has a negative effect on the trees with illegal harvesting beyond the season, and excessive cutting of the bark. The price to pay for this valuable resin overharvesting is the life of the trees. 7 Further, drought conditions and no government to protect the trees is an issue, but designating the forest area as \"Protected\" would help the trees. 7 An additional issue associated with frankin- cense is the exploitation of poor people for labor. It is The Horn of Africa's biggest export after livestock, with an estimated 10,000 families financially dependent on the crop. 10 The women process the resin after it is harvested by the men, typically sitting on a concrete floor for twelve hours a day, and making fifty cents to two dollars a day.7 Working with Fair Trade organizations to have frankincense certified may help set a fair price for harvesters and sustain the trees. 7 Creating a harvesters' cooperative will further promote fair trade, reduce underbidding, and set sustainability standards. 7 Rosewood Rosewood has a rich burgundy color and it is used in making high-end furniture, musical instruments, and oil extracts. It is a South American plant whose precious oil is known to have been used in famous perfumes like Chanel No. 5, Presenced'une Femme, Trussadi Skin, and Lagerfield on the 2017 IUCN Redlist as endangered and is also listed along Threatened Essential Oil Species continued Frankincense (Boswellia sacra)Autumn 2017.3 O. basicordatifolia O. jorge-escobarri, and O. staninoides ; and ten Ocotea species are listed as vulnerable. 1 Unfortunately, trees of all sizes are harvested and destroyed for rosewood oil extraction and other uses. 13 In the Atlantic rainforest of Brazil, heavy harvesting based on a high value of timber and essential oil has rendered many species \"Vulnerable\" to \"Extinct.\" Fragmented and reduced populations of these species are causing the loss of rare alleles; like inbreeding, this will result in a reduction of genetic diversity. 14 Further, it is important that even small populations on fragmented pieces of unprotected land play a role in species survival and improved genetic diversity.14 Illegal logging is also a problem, with issues like cross-border logging in the Cambodian- Lao region.15 As for Ocoetea porosa, selective logging in the Southern Brazilian state of Paran\u00e0 over the past century may have contributed to a lower quantity of the larger trees, which could impact the rate of reproduction and cause local extinction. 16 The canopy openness and gap openings in a cohort composed of more juvenile plants dangerously creates less height variety for the species. 16 Other species in danger include O. obtusata, considered \"Critically Endangered,\" and O. mascarena, which is \"Endangered\" by the country of Mauritius. 3 With the CITES listing of Brazilian rosewood, logging then shifted to Madagascar. 17 In Madagascar, Malagasy rosewood, including Dalbergia baronii, D. louvelli, and D. madagascariensis, is one of the most sought after hardwood crops in the world. 18 Illegal logging is happening at an alarming rate and severely threatening Madagascar rainforests. Local residents are cutting for a very low profit and selling to criminal exporters who have corrupted officials.19 This happens even though the Marojejy National Park has been established as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.18 Madagascar is one of the world's key threatened bio diverse areas with an immediate risk for rosewood species extinction and has been recently protected under CITES. Even though the Malagasy government has prohibited rosewood logging and export as of 2010, weak penalties and poor enforcement prolong the problem. 17 The rosewood logging involves cutting down hundreds of unused trees to get to the bigger trees, ratifying Threatened Essential Oil Species continued Siamese Rosewood (Dalbergia cochinchinensis Pierre) 66 Aromatherapy Journal Autumn 2017.3 \u00a9 Copyright 2017 NAHA Return to Toplandscapes, decreasing soil fertility, and increasing potential fires; thus affecting the local ecosystem of many other plant and animal species. 17 Multiple other species of rosewood are at risk. Siamese rosewood ( Dalbergia cochinchinensis Pierre) of Thailand and Laos is in very high demand and has been illegally logged for the past few decades, affecting genetic diversity.63 Aniba rosaeodora is \"Endangered\" on the 2017.1 IUCN Red List1 and found in South America, with trees of all sizes indiscriminately harvested illegally. 13 Multiple dalbergia species are \"Endangered,\" \"Vulnerable,\" and \"Near Threatened\" due to by the perfume industry; D. oliveti and D. cochinchinensis are listed as \"Priority Tree Species for Gene Conservation\" in Cambodia, and in Nepal, D. latifolia is a \"Vulnerable\" species, 11,3 D. sissoo is considered a \"Threatened\" tree by the country of Pakistan, D. retusa is considered \"Vulnerable\" by the country of Nicaragua, and D. retusa is considered \"Endangered\" by Panama. 3Sandalwood \"Vulnerable\" on the 2017 IUCN Red List.1 Exploitation has drastically affected this parasitic tree, with the rate of extraction far exceeding the rate of growth for many years. 11 Spike disease, grazing animals, and fire have further been a problem for S. album, especially in the Timor Islands.64 Australian sandalwood ( Santalum spicatum ) has been used as a replacement for Santalum album but it has also recently been over- exploited and it has been historically used by major perfume companies.11 Heavy international demand with poor regulation contributes to the problem.20 Further, due to a low supply and high demand, prices have skyrocketed, increasing illegal harvesting.21 Synthetic fragrances have been manufactured to help reduce the demand on this scarce resource. In addition, to try to save this plant, a key issue that needs to be addressed is the low genetic variability, with inbreeding that causes important missing alleles and poor sexual reproduct ion. 22 Before the 1900s, sandalwood was used mainly as incense and for attars and oils. Then, in 1918, India's first sandalwood oil factory was established, using the heartwood from the tree to manufacture shampoos, soaps, perfumes, and cosmetics at an industrial scale.23 From 1950-1970 about 480,000 Santalum album trees were harvested per year in India's southern state of Karnataka. Then in 1974, only a fraction of the trees were left in Karnataka and the species was near to extinction, with the government putting a halt to harvesting.23 Smugglers then made big money on the tree; one man in particular, Threatened Essential Oil Species continued Autumn 2017.3 NAHA's Aromatherapy Journal67 \u00a9 Copyright 2017 NAHA Return to TopVeerappan, became very rich from the illegal trade, thus becoming an embarrassment to Indian police.23 Before 9/11, the hunt for Veerappan was the largest and most costly in Asia. He was finally killed by police in 2004, but other smugglers have since taken his place.23 Santalum album Linn, in the East Nusa Tenggara province of Indonesia, is an important natural commodity representing about 40% of the province's income from 1986- 1992. 24 In the past two decades, the alarming decrease in tree population has forced a governmental ban on harvesting from 1997 - 2003. 24 Local farmer participation in cultivating sandalwood has been low because of strict government policies, with the Regional Regulation Act No. 16/1886 making all sandalwood property of the government regardless of if it was grown on private or state lands. 24 Some districts have since issued new regulations giving more rights to the people, including the cutting and selling of trees, thus encouraging planting. 24 Unsustainable harvesting in the Timor islands with farmers using uncontrolled fire as a method to clear land is a key threat to that local subspecies. 19 Unfavorable legislation in the Timor Islands that is trying to protect the trees, discourages farmers to plant because if they illegally cut or mistreat the sandalwood, they could face criminal charges. This provides a disincentive for local people to help grow more trees. 19 In Sri Lanka, boundary demarcation, declared conservation forests, and increased park staff were implemented to protect and conserve sandalwood, but fire and grazing continue to be a main cause of destruction. In 2010, an effort was made to educate local farmers of the damage caused by fire and grazing and the importance of sandalwood to future generations. 25 Santalum austrocaledonicum from the islands of Vanuatu and New Caledonia is of serious concern, with little remaining of its natural habitat. During the 1840's, sandalwood traders discovered these trees and began overharvesting them. 26 In 1987, the government restricted the quantities logged, but the land was never properly reforested due to disputes of ownership. 26 Below is a list of more sandalwood species in danger: All Santalum species of Hawaii are on the \"At Risk\" list of United Plant Savers.27 Santalum fernandezianum of the Juan Fernandezianum Islands has a of \"Extinct\" by the WCMC.11 Santalum freycinetianum of Polynesia is \"Endangered\" with a need for a moratorium on tree cutting and land conservation 28 and Santalum insulare is \"Vulnerable,\" and the only other sandalwood species of Polynesia.29 Santalum lanceolatum is \"Endangered\" in on the 2017.1 IUCN Red List.1 Located in Papua New Guinea, there are very few mature trees left due to overexploitation.30Threatened Essential Oil Species continued Fruit of Sandalwood (Santalum album) 68 Aromatherapy Journal Autumn 2017.3 \u00a9 Copyright 2017 NAHA Return to TopThreatened Essential Oil Species continued Santalum yasi has been overharvested in Fiji and Tonga, causing a low density and small size of adult trees. 31 Osyris lanceolata is \"Endangered\" in Kenya and declining in Tanzania; and it has been listed on CITES since 2013. 12 Pterocarpus santalinus , red sandalwood, of India is \"Endangered\" on the IUCN 2017.1 Red List and trade is monitored through CITES with new plantations being established. 1, 32, 12 Spikenard (Various Aralia and Nardostachys Species) Rhizomes of the spikenard plant are extracted and used as an essential oil for insomnia, stress, and tension; the drug industry uses it for various degenerative diseases. 33 CAMP reported a population decline of spikenard in India of 75-80%, classifying the plant as \"Endangered,\" with biodiversity under serious threat. 34 Export of the plant has been banned, resulting in an absence of commercial cultivation that has led to untrained extraction, habitat destruction, and premature harvesting. This, along with an increased market price, has resulted in heavy adulteration that creates an essential oil without the same medicinal constituents. 35 Actinidia chinensis, A. debilis, are listed on the 2017.1 IUCN Red List as \"Vulnerable.\"1 A. racemosa and A. californica are on the \"To Watch\" List of United Plant Savers. 27 Nardostachys grandiflora (Jones) DC of the Himalayas was banned for export from Nepal in 1993, and has been listed in CITES since 2007. 12Nardostachys jatamansi is listed as \"Critically Endangered\" on the 2017.1 IUCN Red List, 1 and N. jatamansi DC is on the verge of extinction from over harvesting and degradation of its environment in India, Pakistan, Nepal, Tibet, China, and Yunan.33 Unregulated root collection and loss of habitat needs to be addressed.36 Further, The Red Data Book of Indian Plants lists seventeen species, including N. jatamansi DC. RAPD is a method used in measuring biodiversity of a species: polymorphism, and characterizes variability. N. jatamansi DC was collected and analyzed from India and Nepal to determine better propagation strategy to maintain diversity and conserve the plant in high demand for its medicinal properties. 37 Agarwood ( Aquilaria crassna and Gyrinops Species the 2017.1 IUCN Red List, 1 and multiple species are listed on CITES.12 In high demand and Wood chips of the Agarwood treeAutumn 2017.3 NAHA's Aromatherapy Journal69 \u00a9 Copyright 2017 NAHA Return to TopThreatened Essential Oil Species continued reputed to be the most expensive wood in the world, it can be found in North Eastern India, Bhutan, South East Asia, and Thailand. The aroma from agarwood is created when a fungus infects the tree. Aquilaria crassna is also protected by the Vietnam government, with overharvesting causing a population reduction of over 80%. 38 It is a very expensive essential oil and overharvesting has resulted in seven other Aquilaria species being designated as \"Vulnerable\" on the 2017.1 IUCN Red List.1 All species of Aquilaria and Gyrinops were placed on the CITES Appendix II list of International Trade in Endangered Species. 39 The Indian Forest Act bans extraction and export, to reduce genetic erosion via CIMAP 1997.11 Cedarwood Atlas (Cedrus atlantica and many Juniperus Species) Cedarwood essential oils are obtained from three main species. In America, Juniperus ashei Buch is found in Texas and Juniperus virginiana L. is found in Virginia. In Morocco and India, there is the Cedrus species, and in China, you will find the Cupressus species. It is the Cedrus species whose populations are of the most concern. The essential oil has been marketed for being antiseptic, anticatarrhal, as an expectorant, and as a circulatory stimulant. 40 The tree is also used for furniture, carpentry, construction, tar making, and as an insect repellent.In Morocco, especially, Cedrus atlantica is on the 2017.1 IUCN Red List 1 as \"Endangered\" with up to a 75% decline in population between 1940 and 1982 and continuing to dwindle.41 The Atlas Mountains of Morocco are a Mediterranean Red Alert area with 10,000 km2 of the forest disappearing from 1940 to 1982 and a 40% loss over the past three decades. 40 The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) classifies the conifer forests of North Africa, Morocco, North Tunisia, and North West Algeria as \"Critically Endangered.\" 40 Pest outbreaks and a more arid climate have worsened the situation along with species listed on the 2017.1 IUCN Red List.1 Further, the 1991 - 1996 drought has rendered the area ecologically fragile and susceptible to desertification, erosion, demineralization, and dehydration. 40 Kenyan cedarwood ( Juniperus procera ) was listed as \"Endangered\" by the FAO Forestry Dept. in 1986, listed as \"Endangered\" in Saudi Arabia and Malawi, and listed on the IUCN 2010 Red List of Threatened Species. 40 Juniperus cedrus of the Canary Islands is \"Endangered\" with a population of only 600 sexually mature trees and decreasing.42 Problems for this species have included exploitation of the wood for aromatic timber, a severe fire in 2007 in the El Teide National Cedarwood Atlas (Cedrus atlantica)70 Aromatherapy Copyright 2017 NAHA Return to TopThreatened Essential Oil Species continued Park, and overgrazing.42 Poor genetic diversity needs to be addressed as part of the conservation plan, and the reintroduction of more raven and wintering ring ouzel birds could aid in the long range seed dispersal. 43 In 2000, all goats were removed to improve growth.42 Juniperus communis subsp. Hemisphaerica was identified by Morocco as \"Critically Endangered\" and on the 2017.1 IUCN Red List, 1 being heavily exploited for over 200 years. Illegal logging, fires, lack of regeneration, invasive species, and pests could cause a decline of over 809% by the year 2030, with wood being used to build houses and illegal cutting also being a major problem. 44 Alternative Essential Oil Suggestions for Endangered Plants Consumers have a moral responsibility to avoid purchasing at risk plant species. In many cases, Fair Trade goes along with this issue, where both the plants and the poor people of an area are equally exploited by big businesses who profit highly from the sales of rare essential oils in danger of extinction. The quickest way to look up a species status is at the website www.iucnredlist.org . However a species may be overharvested before it ever makes it onto the IUCN's list. You can also enter a query in Google Scholar of \"plant species name\" and \"threatened\" or \"endangered\" to find additional scholarly status updates, often written by local experts. In doing research, the author has noticed multiple essential oil suppliers selling listed endangered species. In this instance, it is suggested to call the company and discuss the latest status of the species and how, and where from, they obtain their supply before purchasing. The use of alternative essential oils with similar healing properties can be considered as a way to avoid endangered and threatened species. Myrrh comes from the same plant family as frankincense, Burseraceae , and both species are small trees growing in dry climates. The resin extracted from both frankincense and myrrh consists mainly of terpene hydrocarbons along with sesquiterpenes. 45 Both oils can be used for skin healing, immunity strength, and as a decongestant, and have been used as a spiritual incense since Biblical times. Coriander seed (cilantro) extracted from Coriandrum sativum may be a good replacement for rosewood. Both are very high in linalool content and both essential oils have a sweet, spicy, woody scent. As it relates to sandalwood, it seems easiest to recommend avoiding any varieties coming from India, Hawaii, Vanuatu, and New Caledonia unless the educated consumer investigates their source. Alternative species from Australia include Eucaria spicata ) may be a of Kenya. West Indian sandalwood ( Amyris balsamifera ) another possible alternative, comes Aromatherapy Journal71 \u00a9 Copyright 2017 NAHA Return to TopThreatened Essential Oil Species continued Some essential oil companies suggest ho wood (Cinnamomum camphora ) essential oil as an alternative to Indian sandalwood essential oil, but this tree is also in danger.46 Agarwood is an endangered tree whose resin is also highly prized. Its smell is often described as sandalwood-like, and the species listed above may be viable replacements for agarwood. For cedarwood, there are various species across the world and the Moroccan variety seems to be in the most jeopardy, while in Texas, Juniperus ashei is available in abundance. Honeysuckle ( Lonicera spp.) in the same plant family, Caprifoliaceae , as spikenard, so it may be a likely alternative, but it is very costly to extract essential oil from honeysuckle flowers, if at all viable. One idea would be to make a honeysuckle infused oil; however the recipe on this page involves the flowers and not the roots, as in the case of spikenard. Valerian root (Valeriana officinalis) may be another alternative to spikenard, however, as indicated in the appendix of this paper, it has multiple species on the IUCN Red List. 1 Conclusion Frankincense, rosewood, sandalwood, spikenard, agarwood, and cedarwood Atlas all produce amazing essential oils, but it is not worth purchasing them at the cost of species survival. Research has shown stories of overharvesting, human exploitation, and lost habitat that has cost these plants dearly. Frankincense resin of the Horn of Africa is fraught with corruption and exploitation. Rosewood has been stripped in Brazil and has spread to Madagascar.Sandalwood, with a valuable history in the economy of India, may be overprotected by the government to the point that it discourages farmer cultivation. Multiple species from Australia to Hawaii have been made extinct or are in serious danger. Spikenard export has been banned, resulting in a heavily adulterated essential oil. Agarwood has a threatened genetic diversity, with a lack of variation affecting the species. Cedarwood Atlas has seen its conifer forest habitat shrink drastically. The solution to saving these plants must start with the consumer. By refusing to purchase the essential oil sends a message to the supplier that no essential oil is worth the cost of losing species. Honeysuckle Infused Oil Directions for Making and Use: 1. Pick the honeysuckle flowers and allow them to dry for a few hours, but not too much longer as these very delicate flowers may wilt and lose their smell. 2. Put the same quantity of flowers to base oil, such as sunflower ( Helianthus annuus ), in a glass jar and set the jar out in the sun each day for two weeks, bringing it inside in the evening. 3. After two weeks, strain the flowers from the oil using several layers of muslin cloth. It may be necessary to then re-infuse the strained oil with a fresh picking of more lightly dried honeysuckle in the same method for two more weeks to strengthen the scent. The infused oil can be preserved by adding benzoin ( Styrax benzoin ) essential \u00a9 Copyright 2017 NAHA Return TopThreatened Argania spinosaMoroccoIn Morocco, Argania spinosa is \"Endangered\" and its genetic diversity is severely threatened. 47 In addition, Aquilaria malaccensis is \"Endangered\" and protected worldwide by CITES since 1995.12 Buchu Oil from Agathosma betulina South AfricaLucrative for its camphor components, buchu oil has many medicinal uses. It is primarily harvested from the wild, but cultivation is providing more supply to go along with the increasing international demand and to help the poor local population earn income. However, sustainable harvesting is an issue due to the local practices of poverty-stricken people and poor legislation. 48 Calamus Oil fromAcorus calamusIndia, PakistanThis ginger-like plant has become \"Endangered\" in Pakistan, rare in India, and listed as a VU Threatened Medicinal Plant in S India. 11 Highly sought for the medicinal value of its root, it was banned from export during 1997 to save the crop from extinction in the wild.49 Multiple Calamus species are on the 2017 IUCN Red (1). from Hydnocarpus pentandrus & H. kurzii IndiaChaulmoogra is \"Vulnerable\" on the First Red Data List for S.

Here is a roundup of some of their favorite Autumn recipes! Autumn Recipes Contributed by NAHA Directors By Angela Sidlo Ingredients: 1 for Making and Use: Blend essential oils in 1 oz. of jojoba oil in PET bottle with treatment pump top. Gently rock the bottle back and forth to mix essential oils with carrier oil and place the top on the bottle. Rub a small amount of the blend on skin in the throat area, chest and feet 1-2 times a day. Cautions: Avoid use in pregnancy. Avoid use with kidney disease. Avoid use with infants or children under the age of two. In addition, keep out of reach of children and pets. Avoid eye area. Discontinue use if skin irritation occurs. Angela's Tips: This blend can be useful in the fall to get a jump start on the cold and flu season. I love the warm cozy feeling it gives me.Immune Support Blend Autumn Delight Synergy By Annette Davis (Idaho, NAHA President) This is a master synergy blend; it makes about 1 oz. Essential Oils: 220 drops spruce ( clove bud zeylanicum ) Directions for Making and Use: Mix together the essential oils in a suitable bottle. Diffuse drops of the blend (according to manufacturer's guidelines) with a nebulizer, ultrasonic machine, potpourri or wax warmer, light bulb ring, etc. Cautions: The blend may harm wood finishes and plastics. This blend is not intended for topical use unless highly diluted in a carrier (maximum 1% blend in 99% carrier base). May irritate sensitive skin. Not for use by children under 12 years of age. Avoid use in pregnancy. Avoid eye area and mucous membranes. Keep out of reach of children and pets. Annette's Tips: This blend will fill your home or office with the delightful aroma of spicy autumn walks in the woods while purifying the air.Autumn 2017.3 continued Tooth Powder By Valerie Cooksley, RN, OCN, FAAIM, CERT (Texas) Supplies and Ingredients: 4 tsp. baking soda 1 tsp. sea salt (fine ground) 1 tsp. dry 'rubbed' sage ( Salvia officinalis) herb Lemon juice and water to moisten toothbrush Essential Oils: 1 drop peppermint Directions for Making and Use: Combine baking soda and sea salt in a small bowl. Add the drops of essential oil to the sage and grind in a separate dish or mortar and pestle. Carefully check that the sage is finely ground or \"rubbed,\" discarding any rough parts, or stem pieces. Add to the sea salt mix, label and bottle. Store in a wide- mouth jar or a small soft squeezable silicone bottle works well. This dry tooth powder lasts indefinitely. To use, moisten toothbrush with lemon juice or water and dip into tooth powder (or sprinkle it from a bottle). Brush gently. Rinse thoroughly. Cautions: Avoid use in pregnancy. Avoid use with babies and young children.Valerie's Tips : Lemon juice when added to baking soda causes a fizzing action and it is known to whiten tooth enamel, although you will want to rinse well with water since it is acidic in pH. This makes an excellent tooth polisher and it is completely natural!
