I focus on the spiritual aspects of massage allowing my intuition to guide me through each session. I create a sacred healing space where the body and spirit can communicate what it needs. I am trained in several modalities including Swedish, Deep Tissue, Esalen, Lymphatic, Thai Massage, Prenatal, Oncology Massage, Cranial Sacral and Reiki. Each session is tailored to the client's specific needs. I pull from each of these modalities to create a unique healing experience. I may combine relaxation, deep tissue, stretching and energy work all within one session. My technique includes using long flowing deep strokes, deep enough to allow healing but gentle enough to allow the client to remain relaxed. Massage therapy brings relaxation, restores energy, relieves pain and supports the body's natural healing process.
