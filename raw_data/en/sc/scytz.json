Research Scholarship Honors Douglas Hanto, MD, PhD ted Boylan's first encounter with BIdMC was unequivocally positive \u2014 24 years ago, his third child and only daughter, Carolina (\"nina\"), was born at the hospital. the Concord resident's recent experiences at the hospital have, unfortunately , been considerably less so. Last year, nina was diagnosed with advanced liver cancer at BId MC, and began a long and arduous journey that continues to this day . Following her diagnosis, nina's only chance at beating her cancer was the surgical removal of a large liver tumor, which Douglas Hanto, MD, PhD, Chief of the division of t ransplantation, performed in January 2011. nina fared very well until, four months later, follow-up tests revealed that the cancer had spread. After three months of chemotherapy this summer, nina underwent a second operation in late September to remove tumors in her lungs and abdomen. 'A humane surgeon who leads by example' throughout this ordeal, Boylan, a retired businessman, says he has been \"impressed by dr. h anto as a surgeon, a teacher, and a person,\" adding that \"nina trusts him completely . \" In addition to providing superlative clinical care, Boylan says h anto once spent hours searching for \"Bebe,\" nina's beloved childhood stuffed bear who had gotten left behind in her room at BId MC. thanks to h anto's tireless efforts, Bebe was discovered two days later, none the worse for wear, at the hospital's laundry service in Somerville. nina was thrilled. \"dr. h anto epitomizes the humane, patient-focused surgeon, and he leads his trainees by example,\" says Boylan.

Junger, PhD It's the bane of trauma surgeons everywhere: patients who they've helped survive the most devastating traumatic injuries \u2014 burns, gunshots, falls, or major car accidents \u2014 who succumb within a week from rampant infection or multiple organ failure. Identifying the complex cascade of events that cause this tragic but all-too-common phenomenon and finding ways to halt it is the life's work of Wolfgang Junger, PhD , a laboratory scientist in the d epartment of Surgery's r esearch division. Junger's discoveries, which are regularly published in high-profile publications like Science and Nature, could lead to more effective treatments not only for victims of trauma, but someday also for many other patients. Neutrophils: 'Good guys' gone bad Junger, a native Austrian, spends most of his time studying neutrophils and other cells of the immune system. n ormally , neutrophils are \"good guys\" that rally forth to fight infection. But in trauma patients, inflammation causes neutrophils to become excessively activated, transforming them into \"bad guys\" who ruthlessly attack the body's tissues and organs. \"the lungs of trauma patients can be completely destroyed by neutrophils,\" says Junger. As a postdoctoral fellow doing trauma research at the u niversity of California at San diego, Junger discovered \"quite by coincidence\" that hypertonic saline solution can block neutrophils and, at the same time, upregulate infection-fighting t cells. u nknown to Junger at the time, many surgeons were injecting this super-salty fluid into trauma victims in the field to rapidly raise their blood pressure and resuscitate them. While this often worked, no one understood how . 'Solutions to real problems' Junger, who came to BId MC in 2007 , decided to find out, taking advantage of the opportunity to work in close proximity to clinicians. \"that's why I've been working in clinical departments and why I joined BIdMC,\" says Junger. \"I want to do research that is clinically relevant...to find solutions to real problems. \" Supported by several ongoing n ational Institutes of health r O1 grants and funding from the d epartment of defense, the u .S. n avy , and n AtO, Junger has devoted years to understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which hypertonic saline influences immune cells. Out of this work came his discovery that hypertonic solutions cause the release of an intra-cellular mediator called A tP \u2014 the energy source of cells \u2014 from neutrophils into the space outside the cells. he discovered that this, and a complex system that converts A tP to adenosine, can block neutrophils and influence their function, as well as the functions of other cells, including t cells, that are activated by A tP . An improved resuscitation systemgaining an understanding of how hypertonic resuscitation fluids work is no mere intellectual exercise. Junger's group and scientists around the world are using this knowledge in research labs and multi-center clinical trials to develop an improved resuscitation system that \"harnesses the beneficial effects of hypertonic saline in order to benefit trauma patients,\" he says. despite significant progress in that area, what excites Junger the most these days is that his discoveries about A tP release have revealed \"much more general mechanisms regulating the activation of immune cells and their many functions in health and disease,\" he says. Junger's lab is studying these A tP release systems in the hope that this new knowledge will ultimately benefit anyone whose health is compromised by acute or chronic inflammation, such as people with rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease. In a surprising twist, Junger's recent research may also shed new light on how cancer cells metastasize and spread throughout the body . Discoveries from the laboratory of Wolfgang Junger, PhD, may benefit trauma patients and people suffering from chronic or acute inflammatory conditions. In this and many future issues of Inside Surgery, we focus on the question a member of our department \"owns\" \u2014 a question that motivates the individual and inspires his or her work.www.bidmc.org/surgery Inside Surgery \u2014 Page 6Save the Date presented by Yolonda Colson, MD, PhD, Department of Surgery, Brigham and Women's Hospital Location: Simulation and Skills Center, G20 (East Campus), BIDMC For more information: Molly Jay, mjay@bidmc.harvard.edu; 617-667-8258 November 29, 6:30 PM Event: By invitation only, dinner in honor of Jeffrey B.

For a listing of selected faculty publications, books, and book chapters, see page 14 . Daniel Jones, MD, Chief of Minimally Invasive Surgery , reports that the Foundation for Surgical Fellowships awarded funding for two fellows in 2012-2013 for a total of $125,000. It is very rare for any program to receive more than one award, says Jones. h e credits Robert Andrews, MD, Benjamin Schneider, MD, George Blackburn, MD, PhD, Maritza Avendano, and Christine Lynch, for this achievement. In September, transplant psychologist Jim Rodrigue, PhD, t ransplant Surgery , received funding from the h ealth r esources and Services Administration (hr SA) of the u .S. department of h ealth for his research grant application, \"Massachusetts r egistry of Motor V ehicles: Increasing donor r egistry enrollment u sing t argeted Community Outreach and Online Media Campaigns. \" this is a community-based collaborative research effort among BId MC, the n ew england Organ Bank , and the Massachusetts r egistry of Motor V ehicles (rMV). the $750,000 grant was awarded for two years. Among the primary objectives of this research is to determine the relative effectiveness of a targeted rMV media campaign to increase donor registry enrollment in Massachusetts, which has one of the lowest percentages of licensed drivers who are registered organ donors. Vascular Surgery Chief Marc Schermerhorn, MD, is the national principle investigator of a new post-approval study that will follow patients who have received the u .S. Food and drug Administration- approved Medtronic endurant stent graft to treat abdominal aortic aneurysms. the study , coordinated by Mary Trovato, RN, will enroll some 178 patients at 25 sites, including BId MC. the September 21 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) published a study led by BId MC Prostate Center director Martin Sanda, MD, u rology , that found that the increasing survivability of early-stage prostate cancer has made health-related quality of life issues an increasingly important aspect of treatment. In particular, sexual function in previously potent men is among the most important factors in satisfaction with treatment. the study , which spanned two years and included nearly 3,000 men nationwide, enables physicians to better predict a man's recovery of sexual function after prostate cancer treatment, making a conversation between doctor and patient an important part of pre-treatment planning. JAMA selected the paper for its weekly press release, which featured a videotaped interview with Sanda. www.bidmc.org/surgery Inside Surgery \u2014 Page 7HOME << | >> ALuMnI SPOtLIght Amy Evenson, MD Surgeon, t ransplant Surgery , BId MC throughout much of her childhood, Amy Evenson, MD, dreamed of becoming a veterinarian. But when her high school friend's mother died of cancer, evenson realized she wanted to help people and decided to become a physician. After earning her bachelor's degree, summa cum laude, from the g eorge Washington u niversity , evenson attended the u niversity of Maryland School of Medicine, graduating magna cum laude. during her fourth year of medical school, e venson did a one-month rotation at BId MC in vascular surgery . \"I absolutely loved BId MC, the great team dynamics, and extensive contact with faculty and decided I wanted to return there after graduation and train to become a surgeon,\" says e venson. Excellent training She was thrilled when, in 2000, she was matched with her top choice \u2014 the BId MC g eneral Surgery residency Program. For the next seven years, e venson progressively mastered the knowledge and complex skills needed to become a top-notch general surgeon. during that time, she also did a two-year research fellowship focused on basic research of sepsis and muscle metabolism. \"I received excellent technical and research training from an outstanding faculty during my residency ,\" says e venson. Inspired, in part, by her mentors, Douglas Hanto, MD, PhD, and Scott Johnson, MD, e venson decided to follow in their footsteps and become a transplant surgeon. After graduation, she did a two-year fellowship in transplantation surgery at n orthwestern Memorial h ospital in Chicago. As soon as she was able, she returned to Boston and, in 2009, joined the division of t ransplant Surgery at BId MC. Transformative effects evenson loves her work on many levels. \"I enjoy transplant surgery because it's multidisciplinary , technically challenging, and involves caring for the sickest patients,\" she says. She also finds it rewarding to follow patients for a long time before and following a transplant, and to witness the \"transformative\" effects of a successful transplantation. \"there's an immediate gratification that comes from seeing a kidney transplant patient come off dialysis,\" she says. today , in addition to a busy clinical schedule that entails treating current and former transplant patients and adults with hepatobiliary disorders, e venson teaches trainees at all levels and serves as director of BId MC's t ransplant Fellowship Program. She also conducts clinical outcomes research focused on decision-making in transplantation \u2014 for example, determining which organs should be transplanted into which patients to achieve the best possible outcomes. to acquire the knowledge to do that research more rigorously , e venson recently started working on a master's degree at the h arvard School of Public h ealth, a part-time, two-year program that she somehow finds time to fit into her already packed schedule. But e venson is not all work and no play . She loves to ski, run, and participate in marathons, including last year's Boston Marathon. And when time allows, she enjoys baking and often brings in homemade chocolate chip cookies to share with her appreciative colleagues. \"I enjoy transplant surgery because it's multidisciplinary, technically challenging, and involves caring for the sickest patients.\" General Surgery Residency Program alumnus Amy Evenson, MDwww.bidmc.org/surgery Inside Surgery \u2014 Page 8HOME << | >> George Blackburn, MD, PhD, general Surgery/Center for the Study of n utrition Medicine, presented the Kenneth W . Warren, Md, Lecture at n ew england Baptist h ospital, on metabolic considerations in the management of surgical patients. Warren (1911-2001), who served as chairman of general Surgery at Lahey Clinic and chief of Surgery at new england Baptist h ospital, was internationally recognized as an authority on diseases of the pancreas, liver, and biliary tract. recently , Blackburn appeared on WCVB- tV Channel 5 to discuss a new study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association about the ability of cholesterol-lowering foods and dietary advice to significantly reduce low density lipoprotein (LdL, or \"bad\" cholesterol) levels in older adults. the \"Clinical Corner\" feature of a recent issue of BId MC's popular e-newsletter, which has 5,500 subscribers, was authored by Elliot Chaikof, MD, PhD, department chairman. Chaikof addressed the questions patients should ask prior to surgery and when they should seek a second opinion. A video interview of Chaikof discussing these topics, as well as a welcome video, can be viewed on the department of Surgery website. Robin Dann, RN, Otolaryngology , was honored as a compassionate caregiver by a patient who made a donation to the Schwartz Center for Compassionate h ealthcare in her name.

Fellowship status, the highest honor the college bestows on its members, recognizes excellence in the practice and science of clinical pharmacy . BIdMC Cardiac Surgery received the highest possible (three stars) rating by Consumer Reports magazine (September 2011 issue) for its performance of coronary artery bypass surgery . the ratings, based on 2009-2010 (the most recent) data from the Society of thoracic Surgeons, were based on overall performance, complications, and other quality measures. BId MC affiliates Mount Auburn h ospital and Saint Vincent h ospital also received three-star ratings. three groups of third-year h arvard Medical School students, including (above, left to right) y iyin (\"erin\") Chen, Phd , Zachary Abramson, dMd, emir Sandhu, and t aylor Lloyd, were challenged to create the highest free-standing tower using only 20 strands of uncooked spaghetti, a yard each of string and masking tape, and a marshmallow, within 18 minutes. the challenge, led by department Chairman Elliot Chaikof, MD, PhD, during his twice-monthly Professor's hour meeting, emphasizes the importance of innovation and teamwork among surgeons. Surgical residents Bidhan Das, MD, and Scott Atay, MD, participated in the highly competitive \"Surgical Jeopardy\" competition at the American College of Surgery meeting in October, taking second place among 26 teams from surgical residency programs across the country . In a packed exhibition hall and cheered on by faculty members Tara Kent, MD, Russell Nauta, MD, and John Schuler, MD, d as and Atay exhibited their wide-ranging, in-depth surgical knowledge through multiple rounds. \"It was very challenging,\" says d as, a chief resident, \"but lots of fun. \" neWS BrIeFS < Continued from page 8 www.bidmc.org/surgery Inside Surgery \u2014 Page 10HOME << | >> www.bidmc.org/surgeryOn a Mission to Cape Verde Michael Kearney, MD, u rology , provides care for a large population of patients from the African nation of Cape V erde in BId MC's u rology Community Clinic, which he oversees. So when BId MC medical interpreters at the clinic suggested a missionary trip to Cape V erde, which has just one urologist for its entire population of a half-million people, Kearney leapt at the chance. \"Missionary urology was something I'd always wanted to do,\" says Kearney . Loaded with donated supplies, last n ovember (2010) Kearney , along with urology residents David McDermott, MD, and Ravi Kacker, MD, and medical interpreters Bubacar Balde, Carla Iozza, and Luis DaCosta, headed off to Cape V erde, where they spent 72 hours at a hospital about 40 miles from the capital. during that brief period of time, the team, which also included an internist from Miriam h ospital in rhode Island, treated about 90 patients and completed five operations, including the country's first trans-urethral resection of the prostate. they also shared their expertise with several Cape V erdean physicians, who were eager to learn urologic techniques. In fact, Kearney invited a Cape V erdean general surgeon, Elsa Leonor T eixeira Semedo, MD, to come to Boston for six weeks this summer to observe BIdMC surgeons, including: William DeWolf, MD, Andrew Wagner, MD, and Martin Sanda, MD, u rology; Deborah Nagle, MD, Colon and r ectal; Nicholas T awa, MD, Surgical Oncology; Mary Jane Houlihan, MD, general Surgery/BreastCare Center; and Peter Mowschenson, MD, g eneral/ endocrine Surgery . the first mission was such a success that Kearney, McDermott (who graduated last year), a current urology resident, and several interpreters (DaCosta, Iozza, and Ernestina Damoura-Moreria), along with BId MC gastroenterologist Alphonso Brown, MD, are heading back to Cape V erde this n ovember (2011) for a full week, and expect to return every year.

But a Ct scan taken at his local hospital revealed otherwise \u2014 lurking in deLorean's abdomen was a suspicious- looking mass. the doctor referred him to BIdMC, which d eLorean considers his first of many strokes of good luck, where he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. \"If I hadn't gone to Beth Israel d eaconess, I have no doubt I would not be alive today ,\" says deLorean, a quality engineer who lives with his wife in a suburb of Boston. that is no exaggeration. h ad he gone elsewhere, the odds that d eLorean would not only be alive two years after diagnosis, but also feeling great, and \u2014 remarkably \u2014 completely cancer-free, are extremely low . Some 44,000 people every year in the u nited States are diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, which has a dismal five-year survival rate of less than five percent. Like 40 to 50 percent of patients at diagnosis, d eLorean's cancer was locally advanced and inoperable. Most patients in this situation live only between eight and 14 months despite treatments that typically include chemotherapy , radiation therapy , or combinations of both.

Instead, he underwent an innovative, high-tech treatment by a multidisciplinary team at BId MC that includes Mark Callery, MD, chief of the division of g eneral Surgery , and Anand Mahadevan, Md , of the d epartment of radiation Oncology . the treatment involves a combination of chemotherapy and the CyberKnife\u00ae, a state-of-the-art technology that delivers extremely targeted, very high doses of radiation directly to a tumor, sparing most adjacent healthy tissue. unlike conventional radiation therapy , which often requires weeks of daily treatments, CyberKnife therapy is often completed within one to five sessions lasting only about 90 minutes. BId MC's Keith C. Field CyberKnife Center, the first in new england, opened in 2005 and was upgraded to the most advanced technology in 2010. this novel treatment approach, which was developed and refined at BId MC, has gained worldwide attention among the medical community for its positive results. these include reduced side effects; dramatically shorter length of treatment; and, in some cases, extending the survival of patients with locally advanced, unresectable (unable to be surgically removed) pancreatic cancer. \"Our collaborative approach to treatment and use of the CyberKnife has enabled us to take an even more aggressive approach to patients whose pancreatic cancer is deemed unresectable at operation,\" says Callery , an internationally acclaimed pancreatic cancer surgeon who treats hundreds of patients with pancreaticobiliary diseases each year. \"Some patients, like t ony d eLorean, have had truly amazing responses to this innovative therapy . \"Unprecedented accuracy Callery first operated on d eLorean in July 2009, but determined that his tumor was impossible to remove because of its size and location close to major blood vessels. After doing a palliative bypass procedure and before closing d eLorean's incision, Callery implanted several \"fiducial\" seeds around the tumor. these rice-sized slivers of gold serve as coordinates that enable the CyberKnife's sophisticated computer-tracking system to target the patient's tumor with unprecedented accuracy . With chemotherapy administered under the supervision of medical oncologist r yan Sullivan, Md , deLorean's tumor started regressing, which made him a candidate for CyberKnife treatment. \"I had almost no side effects from chemo and the CyberKnife treatments were a breeze,\" says d eLorean, who required just three sessions. n ot long after, in January 2010, Callery re- operated on d eLorean and was able, during a nine- hour procedure, to completely remove the tumor. \" At the completion of his treatment, there was no evidence of cancer,\" says Callery . And periodic follow-up tests continue to show no signs of disease. deLorean says that the care he received from everyone at BId MC was \"beyond belief\" and \"the best of the best. \" But he reserves special praise for Callery , whom he credits with saving his life. \"I'm one lucky man to have had him as my surgeon,\" he says. \"Our collaborative approach to treatment and use of the CyberKnife has enabled us to take an even more aggressive approach to patients whose pancreatic cancer is deemed unresectable at operation.\" Mark Callery, MDwww.bidmc.org/surgery Inside Surgery \u2014 Page 14HOME << | >> Selected Faculty Publications Acute Care Surgery RESEARCH INvESTIGATIoNS: Dutton RP , Parr M, Tortella B, MA, Dimsits J, Holcomb JB, Leppaniemi A, Vincent JL, Hauser CJ; for the CONTROL Study Group.

M dIBL is a nonprofit marine biology lab on the Maine coast where scientists and students conduct a broad range of biomedical research. to honor hanto, Boylan recently made a gift of $50,000 to create the douglas hanto research Scholarship. the scholarship provides five years of funding that allows four second-year surgical residents to attend a weeklong intensive course in comparative physiology at M dIBL. Boylan first learned about the course from BI dMC Chief of Medicine, Mark Zeidel, M d. For several summers, selected medical residents have attended the course and been very enthusiastic about their experience. Exploring physiology and Maine's coastline According to Vice Chair for education Scott Johnson, MD , the weeklong course incorporates six modules that explore landmark experiments in comparative physiology , which are expanded on by resident teams. residents gain experience in dissection, basic science principles, and data analysis, presenting their work to the group at the conclusion of each module. the course also allows time for exploring the Maine coastline, including nearby Acadia national Park, and concludes with a lobster bake. this year, the surgical residents invited to attend the M dIBL course were chosen because they achieved the highest scores on their ABSI te (American Board of Surgery In-Service training exam) test. In ensuing years, at Boylan's request, three of the highest scorers will be invited, along with a \"Captain's Choice\" selected by hanto using other criteria that he deems important. Boylan also committed to purchasing fleece jackets with the M dIBL and BI dMC logos for each year's participants. this summer, the first group of surgical residents \u2014 Prathima Nandivada, MD, Alessandra Mele, MD, KC Collins, MD, and Thomas Curran, MD \u2014 spent the week of August 27 through September 2 at M dIBL. \"We're so grateful for the opportunity to step back from clinical practice to expand our minds in the lab, share ideas across disciplines, and rejuvenate our passion for improving patients' lives,\" says nandivada. \"I'm humbled and flattered by this honor and deeply appreciate [Ted Boylan's] gift, which has and will continue to provide an enriching experience for our surgical residents.\" Douglas Hanto, MD, PhD Wearing their donated fleece jackets are surgical residents (left to right): Thomas Curran, MD, KC Collins, MD, Prathima Nandivada, MD, Alessandra Mele, MD, with Mark Zeidel, MD (center), BIDMC Chief of Medicine.
