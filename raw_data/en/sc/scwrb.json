But maybe you're unsure and debating if you should skip the flu shot this year. We want to share our perspective on the flu vaccine as Functional Medicine providers because hearing a new viewpoint on the flu vaccine can empower you to make an educated decision for yourself. This article will answer the following questions: 'Is the flu shot effective?', 'Is it worth it?' and 'Does it cause long-term health issues?'. So let's dive in. Our Main Concerns Regarding the Flu Shot Concern #1: Weakens Your Immune System Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center researchers showed that getting the flu vaccine can actually [ weaken your immune system in subsequent years.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4387051/) This is especially true for adults [over the age of 65 years](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3514506/) since aging alters both the innate and adaptive branches of the immune system. And when your immune system is weakened...it can lead to more severe flu symptoms. Seems counterintuitive, doesn't it? So while the flu shot may actually increase your risk of getting the flu, the shot can even contribute to chronic disease with its toxic ingredients, like: - Aluminum (a known neurotoxin) - Formaldehyde (a known carcinogen) - Thimerosal (preservative) - Triton X100 (a detergent) - And other additives known to cause allergic reactions Concern #2: Heightens Your Toxic Load, Contributing to Chronic Disease When you get the flu shot, you aren't simply getting antibodies for the suspected flu strain. You are also getting additional ingredients, like formaldehyde and thimerosal, injected into your body that can contribute to your toxic load. When we say \"toxic load\", we are referring to the accumulation of chemicals or molecules that are foreign to our biological systems. So while one flu shot may not send your body into a full-blown chronic disease state, yearly vaccines can add to the already horrible toxin exposure our body deals with in our current society. The issue with this is that over time, heightened toxic loads can put your immune response into overdrive, causing cellular dysfunction, and inflammation, leading to chronic health issues. In fact, [70-90% ](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature16166)of cancers are caused by poor diet and environmental factors (like toxins), and [ toxic exposure also contributes to cardiovascular diseases, strokes, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, arthritis, thyroiditis, and chronic infections.](http://integrativemedcrossroads.com/patient-education/reduction-of-toxic-load/) Avoiding as many toxins as possible is the best thing you can do for your immune system and long-term health. Concern #3: The Flu Shot Isn't as Effective as You Thought \"Is the flu vaccine even effective?\" you might ask. Well, you may be surprised to learn that the Flu shot is not as effective as you thought, or have been told. In fact, the CDC even states that [ the flu shot is effective only 50% of the time.](https://www.nvic.org/newsletter/apr-2016/cdc-admits-flu-shots-fail-half-the-time) If you're an older adult, it's even [less effective](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3514506/). Some years, [ flu shot effectiveness plunges to as low as 10%!](https://www.science.org/content/article/why-flu-vaccines-so-often-fail) Here's why effectiveness is so low. Flu vaccine companies create their seasonal flu vaccine based on which circulating flu virus they believe will be the most apparent during the flu season. They chose the year's virus strain at the beginning of the year ( [March](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/lot-release/influenza-vaccine-2022-2023-season#:~:text=FDA's%20Vaccines%20and%20Related%20Biological,2022%2D2023%20U.S.%20influenza%20season.)), months before the actual flu season. If they guess wrong, the flu vaccine won't actually protect your body from the strain that's going around. So, in short, if you take the flu shot, you can weaken your immune system, making your body more vulnerable to the flu strain that's circulating. Also, research is emerging that shows the impact of repeat vaccination can potentially [ contribute to lower vaccine effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccines](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-11296-5). Why the Government Pushes Flu Shots You might be thinking, \"well, if it's not that effective, why are flu shots pushed so heavily by the government?\" And that's a good question to ask. The answer is money. The government needs a healthy economy. And what makes a healthy economy? These huge pharma companies making money! In fact, Wendell Potter, a former high-ranking health insurance executive who is now pretty outspoken about the problem with health insurance and the healthcare industry, once agreed and restated the quote... \"We do not really have a health care system in this country. We have a disease management industry, and from the perspective of a lot of healthcare providers, certainly most pharmaceutical companies, they are not all that keen on getting you well. They would love for you to be on maintenance medications for the rest of your life. That is how they make money.\" You see, they aren't concerned about your health, they care about the money. If it was about your health, we could see campaigns about eating whole foods, exercise programs, fruit, and vegetable stipends to farmers instead of wheat and corn. Pesticides would be banned by big agriculture. But we don't see this safe, effective, holistic approach. At in2GREAT, we genuinely care about your health. How to Protect Yourself From the Flu Without Getting the Flu Shot We want to empower you to take control of your health and offer you alternative options other than getting the Flu shot.
