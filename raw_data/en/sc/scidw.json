The U.S. vaccine safety system ensures that all vaccines are as safe as possible. Learn how federal partners are working together to [ensure the safety of COVID-19 vaccines](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety.html). CDC has developed a new tool, [v-safe](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/vsafe.html), as an additional layer of safety monitoring to increase our ability to rapidly detect any safety issues with COVID-19 vaccines. V-safe is a new smartphone-based, after-vaccination health checker for people who receive COVID-19 vaccines. Vaccine doses purchased with U.S. taxpayer dollars will be given to the American people at no cost. However, vaccination providers may be able to charge administration fees for giving the shot. Vaccination providers can get this fee reimbursed by the patient's public or private insurance company or, for uninsured patients, by the [Health Resources and Services Administration's Provider Relief Fund](https://www.hhs.gov/coronavirus/cares-act-provider-relief-fund/index.html) Vaccines are administered by injection, so there will be a small pinch. After COVID-19 vaccination, you may have some side effects. This is a normal sign that your body is building protection. The side effects from COVID-19 vaccination may feel like flu and might even affect your ability to do daily activities, but they should go away in a few days. Learn more about what [side effects to expect and get helpful tips](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/expect/after.html) on how to reduce pain and discomfort after your vaccination. When you get the vaccine, you and your healthcare worker will both need to wear masks that cover your nose and mouth. Stay 6 feet away from others while inside and in lines. When You Get Vaccinated We don't know yet. It depends on how long it takes for most people in the community to achieve immunity. Until we know more, continue to practice social distancing and wear a mask when near other people. This guide was developed by Leslie Murtha, Atlantic Cape Community College Libraries. Published "}
