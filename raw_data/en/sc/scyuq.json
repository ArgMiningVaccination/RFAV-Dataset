There will be unanticipated challenges , but CDC will continue to work closely with you, our partners, to find solutions and overcome obstacles. Vaccines are an important tool to control the pandemic, but we need to continue to message the importance of masks, social distancing, and hand washing. Community engagement is critical to vaccination implementation success -Engage in conversations in your community, choose to get vaccinated when it's your turn, share CDC resources and toolkits 12/21/20 Clinical ResourcesEngaging in Effective COVID -19 Vaccine Conversations -https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid - 19/hcp/engaging -patients.htm Toolkit for Medical Clinics, -https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid - systems -communication -toolkit.html More toolkits coming soon -term care facilities -Health departments -Community -based organizations -Employers of essential workersCOVID- 19 vaccine communication resources 23 For more information, contact CDC 1-800- The findings and conclusions in this report are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the official position of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
