Several pharmacological and surgical therapies have been developed; however, they are accompanied by some adverse effects. As a result, many patients have been resorting to complementary medicine, namely acupuncture, in the hope of obtaining symptomatic improvements without having disruptive side effects. Therefore, advances in research in this area are very important. This work presents a systematic review of the effectiveness of acupuncture treatments in relieving PD symptoms. Methods: EMBASE, Medline, Pubmed, Science Direct, The Cochrane Library, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Central) and Scielo databases, were systematically searched from January 2011 through July 2021. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published in English with all types of acupuncture treatment were included. The selection and analysis of the articles was conducted by two blinding authors through Rayyan application. Results: A total of 720 potentially relevant articles were identified; 52 RCTs met our inclusion criteria. After the exclusion of 35 articles, we found 17 eligible. The included RCTs reported positive effects for acupuncture plus conventional treatment compared with conventional treatment alone in the UPDRS score. Conclusions: Although all the studies reviewed pointed out a positive effect of acupuncture on improving motor and non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease, we found great discrepancies regarding the studies' design and methodology, making difficult any comparison between them.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2022-11-21", "cleaned_text": "Effectiveness of Acupuncture in Parkinson's Disease Symptoms\u2014A Systematic Review [https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare10112334](https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare10112334) [Advances in Integrative 1. Introduction [1](#B1-healthcare-10-02334), [2](#B2-healthcare-10-02334), is still not fully understood [ [4](#B4-healthcare-10-02334)]. It is a progressive pathology that affects one in every 1000 people over 60 years of age and at least 6 million people around the world [ [5](#B5-healthcare-10-02334)], representing a high economic cost, causing high rates of institutionalisation and, increased health costs [ [6](#B6-healthcare-10-02334), [7](#B7-healthcare-10-02334), [8](#B8-healthcare-10-02334)]. [9](#B9-healthcare-10-02334), [10](#B10-healthcare-10-02334), [11](#B11-healthcare-10-02334)]. Non-motor symptoms occur earlier and have a more profound impact on the quality of the patient's life [ [8](#B8-healthcare-10-02334)], including pain, fatigue, insomnia, anxiety, and depression [ [12](#B12-healthcare-10-02334)]. [12](#B12-healthcare-10-02334)]. In the clinic, conventional medical treatment consists of the internal administration of levodopa (LD), which is a symptom modifier for a limited time [ [3](#B3-healthcare-10-02334)]. More than 50% of patients begin to experience LD-induced fluctuations after 2 to 5 years, beginning to develop involuntary motor movements called dyskinesias [ [13](#B13-healthcare-10-02334)]. This rate increases to 80% in patients with more than 10 years of levodopa use [ [2](#B2-healthcare-10-02334)]. Even though other drugs can be used, none of them is entirely efficient and is usually accompanied by a high rate of side effects [ [14](#B14-healthcare-10-02334)]. [1](#B1-healthcare-10-02334), [13](#B13-healthcare-10-02334)]. [8](#B8-healthcare-10-02334), [15](#B15-healthcare-10-02334), [16](#B16-healthcare-10-02334)]. It has been found that acupuncture can protect dopaminergic neurons from degeneration via anti-oxidative stress, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic pathways as well as modulating the neurotransmitter in the basal ganglia circuit [ [3](#B3-healthcare-10-02334)]. [8](#B8-healthcare-10-02334), [17](#B17-healthcare-10-02334)]. More studies, either comparative effectiveness research or high-quality placebo-controlled clinical studies were necessary [ [18](#B18-healthcare-10-02334)]. [2](#B2-healthcare-10-02334), non-motor symptoms are progressively emphasised, and objective behavioural assessment tools are being employed [ [12](#B12-healthcare-10-02334)]. So, it is now worth summarizing and updating the current best evidence for the use of acupuncture in PD management. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Search Strategy and Methods for Study Identification and Screening Literature Search 2.2. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria 2.2.1. Types of Studies 2.2.2. Participants 2.2.3. Types of Interventions 2.2.4. Types of Outcome Measures 2.3. Data Collection, Analysis and Management [Figure 1](#healthcare-10-02334-f001). [Figure 1](#healthcare-10-02334-f001)). Meta-analysis was not performed as there are no comparators in the included studies. participant baseline characteristics, type of acupuncture treatment, frequency of treatment, and outcome measures were narratively synthesized in [Table 1](#healthcare-10-02334-t001). 3.1. Participants 3.1.1. Groups 3.1.2. Number of Participants 3.1.3. Including and Excluding Criteria [38](#B38-healthcare-10-02334)], which is adopted by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, US National Institute of Health, two based the diagnosis on criteria of the Core Assessment Program for Intracerebral Transplantation (CAPIT), another one diagnosed with clinically definite idiopathic PD by a neurologist from the Kyung Hee Medical Hospital, and the last one used diagnostic criteria of the Motor Disorder and (PD) Group of the Chinese Medical Association Neurology Chapter. The other four [ [23](#B23-healthcare-10-02334), [33](#B33-healthcare-10-02334), [36](#B36-healthcare-10-02334)], did not defined the diagnose criteria. 3.2. Randomisation 3.3. Treatment Characteristics used in nine, eight employed GV20 motor sensory area, balance area and chorea-tremor controlled zone were applied in two different articles. 3.3.2. Recurrence Rate 3.3.3. Efficacy Rate [37](#B37-healthcare-10-02334)] concluded that acupuncture may improve PD-related fatigue but looking at the results, real acupuncture offered no greater benefit than sham treatments. 3.4. Outcome Measure 3.5. Adverse Events 4. Discussion [2](#B2-healthcare-10-02334), [39](#B39-healthcare-10-02334), [40](#B40-healthcare-10-02334)]. However, although the evidence had been inconclusive, the therapeutic potential of acupuncture in Parkinson's disease seemed to be quite promising [ [41](#B41-healthcare-10-02334), [42](#B42-healthcare-10-02334)]. Thus, the present systematic review including renewed literature with recent RCTs, a large sample size and better-quality studies would be important to provide better evidence on the efficiency of acupuncture in Parkinson's disease symptoms [ [43](#B43-healthcare-10-02334)]. [43](#B43-healthcare-10-02334)]. Additionally, some studies found that when acupuncture was used as an adjuvant to pharmacology, namely levodopa, it improved its therapeutic efficacy, allowing a reduction in the dose and the occurrence of adverse effects arising from its use [ [40](#B40-healthcare-10-02334)]. There seem to be no differences in the effectiveness concerning the type of acupuncture used (body acupuncture, electroacupuncture or scalp acupuncture) but we did not find studies on the comparison of different Chinese medicine approaches [ [39](#B39-healthcare-10-02334)]. [2](#B2-healthcare-10-02334), [42](#B42-healthcare-10-02334)]. This lack of standardisation made it difficult to compare them [ [39](#B39-healthcare-10-02334), [40](#B40-healthcare-10-02334), [43](#B43-healthcare-10-02334)]. [27](#B27-healthcare-10-02334)] using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) as an objective measure, showed that acupuncture reduces tremors in patients with Parkinson's disease. [2](#B2-healthcare-10-02334), [39](#B39-healthcare-10-02334)], particularly in terms of the selection of points. Most of the studies included in this systematic review assessed the effectiveness of a group of points, which were chosen based on the theoretical support of traditional Chinese medicine. However, the group of points was different in all studies, as well as the respective theoretical support, which limits the comparison between them. This makes it equally difficult to provide evidence on which point contributes to the improvement of which symptom. Although traditional Chinese medicine professionals document their clinical practice, there is still little literature involving the parameters of the selection of meridians and standardised acupoints [ [9](#B9-healthcare-10-02334)]. In this systematic review, only one study evaluated the effectiveness of a single point [ [28](#B28-healthcare-10-02334)]. [44](#B44-healthcare-10-02334)]. [10](#B10-healthcare-10-02334)], others, using functional magnetic resonance, indicated that acupuncture activates the putamen and the primary motor cortex, and these activations were correlated with the most appropriate motor function [ [45](#B45-healthcare-10-02334)], suggesting additional involvement of the posterior medial cortex and temporal cortex in the central effect of acupuncture, called \"limbic-paralimbic-neocortical network\" [ [13](#B13-healthcare-10-02334)]. Recently, Zhao et al. found that, particularly during the early stages, acupuncture may reduce the neurodegeneration of dopaminergic neurons and regulates the balance of the dopaminergic circuit, thus delaying the progression of the disease [ [3](#B3-healthcare-10-02334)]. [43](#B43-healthcare-10-02334)]. Finally, it would be also very important to promote the performance of studies with higher quality, following STRICTA and/or CONSORT recommendations, since most of the existent bibliography lacks it [ [2](#B2-healthcare-10-02334), [43](#B43-healthcare-10-02334)]. 5. Conclusions [18](#B18-healthcare-10-02334)]. Second, the long-term effects must be measured. Third, objective assessments using portable novel computerised technologies should be considered. Fourth, comparative studies should be carried out about the differences in effectiveness among scalp acupuncture, electropuncture and systemic acupuncture, to see which one is more effective in reducing PD symptoms. Fifth, the correlation between the changes in the symptoms and neurological changes should be investigated. Sixth, target symptoms should be selected and evaluated instead of only performing global evaluations. Seventh, large, multicentre, well-designed RCTs should be organised for evaluation of the efficacy of acupuncture.
