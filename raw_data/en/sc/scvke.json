And the answer is a resounding YES! But many people are looking for a quick fix. Something that everyone can take before the vaccine or after so they can go skipping away without a care in the world. Truth is, we are all different and everyone reacts differently to an injectable. So the answer is not a quick fix, it's an intelligent response based on experience and good clinical results. First and foremost, follow medical advice and stay in the assigned waiting area for 20 minutes after you've gotten the vaccination. If you have no outward allergic reaction, you may leave. But this is not the time to go jogging or to play soccer. Best to have a quiet day, with plenty of down time and light nutritious meals. This way your body will be in the best shape to respond in a healthy fashion which will result in minimal side effects. Should you feel soreness at the vaccination site with redness and aching in the arm, homeopathic Ledum palustre can ease the discomfort. Take one dose as soon as symptoms arise. If the pain continues, you can repeat Ledum four hours later. This should be all you need to see a response. Some people don't feel soreness at all. Instead they develop a headache or a mild fever. For this, homeopaths recommend Silica. Again, take as soon as symptoms develop and repeat up to three times a day for two days. Another common response to vaccines is overall fatigue and weakness which may come with a headache or chills. Gelsemium sempervirens is the most appropriate remedy in such instances. Take when symptoms arise and repeat up to four times a day for two days. You can purchase a 30C potency of any of these remedies at your local health food store or pharmacy or from an online source. Take 2-3 pellets at a time and let the pleasant tasting pellets dissolve on or under your tongue. Homeopathy works best when you avoid food for 10-15 minutes before and after taking a remedy. We can all learn from the example above that with homeopathy, we wait till symptoms arise and then we give the most appropriate remedy for the individual's presentation. For vaccine reactions, Ledum, Silica and Gelsemium are three of the most commonly used homeopathic medicines. With Ledum, used for very localized symptoms, you may need only one or two doses. For Silica, which treats a bit stronger symptoms, you may need three doses a day. And with Gelsemium, used to treat slightly more intense generalized reactions, you may need four doses a day. Also know that, if your symptoms do not match a remedy clearly or if you do not respond within 24 hours, you probably can benefit from another remedy not mentioned here and you should get professional homeopathic care. Of course, if your symptoms increase over time, then you should seek medical attention so you can be properly treated. "}
