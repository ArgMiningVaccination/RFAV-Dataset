Acupuncture & acupressure . These techniques stimulate specific points on the body, called acupoints, to help alleviate symptoms.

Massage therapy improves relaxation and helps alleviate stress. A variety of techniques including tui na, shiatsu and aromatherapy may be incorporated. Reflexology applies pressure (varying from light to deep) to specific points on the hands and feet that correspond to various body systems.

Mind-body therapies aim to help patients develop an awareness of the connection between their body, mind and spirit.
