History and Psychological / Psychiatric Examination ...... 19 D.1 Initial Assessment Behavioral -Trauma J.2 NYS WCB MTG - Disorder and Acute Stress MTG - Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and Acute Stress Disorder 8 A. General Guideline Principles The principles summarized in this section are key to the intended application of the New York State Medical Treatment Guidelines (MTG) and are applicable to all Workers' Compensation Medical Treatment Guidelines. A.1 Medical Care Medical care and treatment required as a result of a work -related injury should be focused on restoring functional ability required to meet the patient's daily and work activities with a focus on a return to work, while striving to restore the patient's health to its pre-injury status in so far as is feasible. A.2 Rendering Of Medical Services Any medical provider rendering services to a workers' compensation patient must utilize the Treatment Guidelines as provided for with respect to all work -related injuries and/or illnesses. A.3 Positive Patient Response Positive results are defined primarily as functional gains which can be objectively measured. Objective functional gains include, but are not limited to, positional tolerances, range of motion, strength, endurance, activities of daily living (ADL), cognition, psychological behavior, and efficiency/velocity measures which can be quantified. Subjective reports of pain and function may be considered and given relative weight when the pain has anatomic and physiologic correlation in proportion to the injury. A.4 Re-Evaluate Treatment If a given treatment or modality is not producing positive results within a well - defined timeframe, the provider should either modify or discontinu e the treatment regime. The provider should evaluate the efficacy of the treatment or modality 2 to 3 weeks after the initial visit and 3 to 4 weeks thereafter. These timeframes may be slightly longer in the context of conditions that are inherently mental health issues, and shorter for other non -musculoskeletal medical conditions (e.g. pulmonary, dermatologic etc.). Recognition that treatment failure is at times attributable to an incorrect diagnosis a failure to respond should prompt the clinician to reconsider the diagnosis in the event of an unexpected poor response to an otherwise rational intervention. A.5 Education Education of the patient and family, as well as the employer, insurer, policy makers and the community should be a primary e mphasis in the treatment of work -related injury or illness. Practitioners should develop and implement effective educational strategies and skills. An education -based paradigm should always start with communication providing reassuring information to the p atient. No treatment plan is complete without addressing issues of individual and/or group patient education as a means of facilitating self -management of symptoms and prevention of future injury. NYS WCB MTG - Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and Acute Stress Disorder 9 Time Frames A.6 Acuity Acute, Subacute and Chronic are generally defined as timeframes for disease stages: Acute - Less than one month Subacute - One to three month, and Chronic - greater than three months. A.7 Initial Evaluation Initial evaluation refers to the acute timeframe following an injury and is not used to define when a given physician first evaluates an injured worker (initial encounter) in an office or clinical setting. A.8 Diagnostic Time Frames Diagnostic time frames for conducting diagnostic testing commence on the date of injury. Clinical judgment may substantiate the need to accelerate or decelerate the time frames discussed in this document. A.9 Treatment Time Frames Treatment time frames for specific interventions commence once treatments have been initiated, not on the date of injury. It is recognized that treatment duration may be impacted by disease process and severity, patient compliance, as well as availability of services. Clinical judgment may substantiate the need to accelerate or decelerate the time frames discussed in this document. A.10 Delayed Recovery For those patients who fail to make expected progress 6 -12 weeks after an injury and whose subjective symptoms do not correlate with objective signs and tests, reexamination in order to confirm the accuracy of the diagnosis and re -evaluation of the treatment program should be performed. When addressing a clinical issue that is not inherently a mental health issue, assessment for potential barriers to recovery (yellow flags/psychological issues) should be ongoing throughout t he care of the patient. At 6-12 weeks, alternate treatment programs, including formal psychological or psychosocial evaluation should be considered. Clinicians must be vigilant for any pre -existing mental health issues or subsequent, consequential mental health issues that may be impacting recovery. For issues that are clearly and inherently mental health issues from the outset (i.e. when it is evident that there is an underlying, work -related, mental health disorder as part of the cla im at issue), referral to a mental health provider can and should occur much sooner. Referrals to mental health providers for the evaluation and management of delayed recovery do not indicate or require the establishment of a psychiatric or psychological c ondition. The evaluation and management of delayed recovery does not require the establishment of a psychiatric or psychological claim. Treatment Approaches NYS WCB MTG - Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and Acute Stress Disorder 10 A.11 Active Interventions Active interventions emphasizing patient responsibility, such as therapeutic exercise and/or functional treatment, are generally emphasized over passive modalities, especially as treatment progresses. Generally, passive and palliative interventions are viewed as a means to facilitate progress in an active rehabilitation program with concomitant attainment of objective functional gains. A.12 Active Therapeutic Exercise Program Active therapeutic exercise program goals should incorporate patient strength, endurance, flexibility, range of motion, sensory integration, coordination, cognition and behavior (when at issue) and education as clinically indicated. This includes functional application in vocational or community settings. A.13 Diagnostic Imaging And Testing Procedures Clinical information obtained by history taking and physical examination should be the basis for selection of imaging procedures and interpretation of results. All diagnostic procedures have characteristic specificities and sensitivities for various diagnoses. Usually, selecti on of one procedure over others depends upon various factors, which may include: relative diagnostic value; risk/benefit profile of the procedure; availability of technology; a patient's tolerance; and/or the treating practitioner's familiarity with the procedure. When a diagnostic procedure, in conjunction with clinical information, provides sufficient information to establish an accurate diagnosis, a second diagnostic procedure is not required. However, a subsequent diagnostic procedure including a repeat of the original (same) procedure can be performed, when the specialty physician (e.g. physiatrist, sports medicine physician or other appropriate specialist) radiologist or surgeon documents that the initial study was of inadequate quali ty to make a diagnosis. Therefore, in such circumstances, a repeat or complementary diagnostic procedure is permissible under the MTG. It is recognized that repeat imaging studies and other tests may be warranted by the clinical course and/or to follow th e progress of treatment in some cases. It may be of value to repeat diagnostic procedures (e.g., imaging studies) during the course of care to reassess or stage the pathology when there is progression of symptoms or findings, prior to surgical interventions and/or therapeutic injections when clinically indicated, and post -operatively to follow the healing process. Regarding serial imaging, (including x -rays, but particularly CT scans), it must be recognized that repeat procedures result in an in crease in cumulative radiation dose and associated risks. A given diagnostic imaging procedure may provide the same or distinctive information as obtained by other procedures. Therefore, prudent choice of procedures(s) for a single diagnostic procedure, a complementary procedure in combination with other procedures(s), or a proper sequential order in multiple procedures will ensure maximum diagnostic accuracy, minimize the likelihood of adverse effect on patients, and promote efficiency by avoiding duplica tion or redundancy. NYS WCB MTG - Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and Acute Stress Disorder 11 A.14 Surgical Interventions Consideration of surgery should be within the context of expected functional outcome. The concept of \"cure\" with respect to surgical treatment by itself is generally a misnomer. All operative interventions must be based upon positive correlation of clinical findings, clinical course and imaging and other diagnostic tests. A comprehensive assimilation of these factors must lead to a specific diagnosis with positive identification of pa thologic condition(s). For surgery to be performed to treat pain, there must be clear correlation between the pain symptoms and objective evidence of its cause. In all cases, shared decision making with the patient is advised. The patient should be given t he opportunity to understand the pros and cons of surgery, potential for rehabilitation as an alternative where applicable, evidence -based outcomes, and specific surgical experience. A.15 Pre-Authorization All diagnostic imaging, testing procedures, non -surgic al and surgical therapeutic procedures, and other therapeutics within the criteria of the Medical Treatment Guidelines and based on a correct application of the Medical Treatment Guidelines are considered authorized, with the exception of the procedures li sted in section 324.3(1)(a) of Title 12 NYCRR. These are not included on the list of pre -authorized procedures. Providers who want to perform one of these procedures must request pre -authorization from the carrier before performing the procedure. Second or subsequent procedures (the repeat performance of a surgical procedure due to failure of, or incomplete success from the same surgical procedure performed earlier, if the Medical Treatment Guidelines do not specifically address multiple procedures ) also require pre-authorization. A.16 Psychological/Psychiatric Evaluations In select patients, mental health evaluations are essential to make, secure or confirm a diagnosis. Of course, the extent and duration of evaluations and/or interventions by mental health professionals may vary, particularly based on whether: the underlying clinical issue in the claim is inherently a mental health issue; or there is a mental health issue that is secondary or consequential to the medical injury or illness that is at issue in the claim in question; or there is a pre - existing, unrelated mental health issue that has been made worse by, or is impeding the recovery from (or both) the medical injury or illness that is at issue in the claim in question. Tests of psyc hological function or psychometric testing, when indicated, can be a valuable component of the psychological evaluation in identifying associated psychological, personality and psychosocial issues. Although these instruments may suggest a diagnosis, neithe r screening nor psychometric tests are capable of making a diagnosis. The diagnosis should only be made after careful analysis of all available data, including from a thorough history and clinical interview. NYS WCB MTG - Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and Acute Stress Disorder 12 A professional fluent in the prim ary language of the patient is strongly preferred. When such a provider is not available, services of a professional language interpreter must be provided. Frequency: When assessing for a pre-existing, unrelated mental health issue that has been made worse by, or is impeding the recovery from (or both) a work - related, medical injury or illness, then a one -time visit for initial psychiatric/psychological encounter should be sufficient, as care would normally be continued by the prior treating provider. If psychometric testing is indicated by findings in the initial encounter, time for such testing should not exceed an additional three hours of professional time. For conditions in which a mental health issue is a central part of the initial claim, or in which there is a mental health issue that is secondary or consequential to the work -related, medical injury or illness, that is part of the claim in question, then more extensive diagnostic and therapeutic interventions may be clinically indicated, and are discussed in detail in the Medical Treatment Guidelines for such mental health conditions. A.17 Personality/Psychological/Psychosocial Intervention Following psychosocial evaluation, when intervention is recommended, such intervention should be implemented as soon as possible. This can be used alone or in conjunction with other treatment modalities. For all psychological/psychiatric interventions, there must be an assessment and treatment plan with measurable behavioral goals, time frames and specific interventions planned . Time to produce effect: two to eight weeks. Optimum duration: six weeks to three months. Maximum duration: three to six months. Counseling is not intended to delay but rather to enhance functional recovery. For PTSD Psychological Intervention: Optimum duration three to six months. Maximum duration: nine to twelve months. For select patients, longer supervision and treatment may be required, and if further treatment is indicated, documentation of the nature of the ps ychological factors, as well as projecting a realistic functional prognosis, should be provided by the authorized treating practitioner every four weeks during the first six months of treatment. For treatment expected to last six to twelve months, such documentation should be provided every four to eight weeks. For long -term treatment beyond twelve months, such documentation should be provided every eight to twelve weeks. All parties should strive for ongoing and continuous communications, in order to fa cilitate seamless, continuous and uninterrupted treatment. NYS WCB MTG - Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and Acute Stress Disorder 13 A.18 Functional Capacity Evaluation (FCE) Functional capacity evaluation is a comprehensive or more restricted evaluation of the various aspects of function as they relate to the patient's ability to return to work. Areas such as endurance, lifting (dynamic and static), postural tolerance, specific range -of-motion, coordination and strength, worker habits, employability, as well as psychosocial, cognitive, and sensory perceptual as pects of competitive employment may be evaluated. Components of this evaluation may include: (a) musculoskeletal screen; (b) cardiovascular job (f) maximum voluntary effort; (g) pain assessment/psychological screening; (h) non - material and material handling activities; (i) cognitive and behavioral; (j) visual; and (k) sensory perceptual factors. In most cases, the question of whether a patient can return to work can be answered without an FCE. An FCE may be considered at time of MMI, following reasonable prior attempts to return to full duty throughout course of treatment, when the treating physician is unable to make a clear determin ation on work status on case closure. An FCE is not indicated early during a treatment regime for any reason including one to support a therapeutic plan. When an FCE is being used to determine return to a specific job site, the treating physician is respo nsible for understanding and considering the job duties. FCEs cannot be used in isolation to determine work restrictions. The authorized treating physician must interpret the FCE in light of the individual patient's presentation and medical and personal perceptions. FCEs should not be used as the sole criteria to diagnose malingering. A.19 Return To Work For purposes of these guidelines, return to work is defined as any work or duty that the patient is able to perform safely. It may not be the patien t's regular work. Ascertaining a return to work status is part of medical care, and should be included in the treatment and rehabilitation plan. It is normally addressed at every outpatient visit. A description of the patient's status and task limitations is part of any treatment plan and should provide the basis for restriction of work activities when warranted. Early return to work should be a prime goal in treating occupational injuries. The emphasis within these guidelines is to move patients along a continuum of care and return to work, since the prognosis of returning an injured worker to work drops progressively the longer the worker has been out of work. A.20 Job Site Evaluation The treating physician may communicate with the employer or employer's designee, either in person, by video conference, or by telephone, to obtain information regarding the individual or specific demands of the patient's pre -injury job. This may include a description of the exertional demands of the job, the need for repetitive activities, load lifting, static or awkward postures, environmental exposures, psychological stressors and other factors that would pose a barrier to re-entry, risk of re-injury or disrupt convalescence. When NYS WCB MTG - Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and Acute Stress Disorder 14 returning to work at the patient's previous job tasks or setting is not feasible, given the clinically determined restrictions on the patient's activities, inquiry should be made about modified duty work settings that align with, the patient's condition in view of prop osed work activities/demands in modified duty jobs. It should be noted, that under certain circumstances, more than one job site evaluation may be indicated. Ideally, the physician would gain the most information from an on -site inspection of the job settings and activities; but it is recognized that this may not be feasible in most cases. If job videos/CDs/DVDs are available from the employer, these can contribute valuable information, as can video conferences, conducted from the worksite and ideally workstation or work area. Frequency: one or two contacts 1st contact: Patient is in a functional state where the patient can perform some work. 2nd contact: Patient has advanced to state where the patient is capable of enhanced functional demands in a work environment. The physician shall document the conversation. Other A.21 Guideline Recommendations And Medical Evidence The Workers' Compensation Board and its Medical Advisory Committee have not independently evaluated or vetted the scientific medical literature used in support of the guidelines, but have relied on the methodology used by the developers of various guidelines utilized and referenced in these Guidelines. A.22 Experimental/Investigational Treatment Medical treatment that is experimental/investigational and not approved for any purpose, application or indication by the FDA is not permitted under these Guidelines. A.23 Injured Workers As Patients In these Guidelines, injured workers are referred to as patients recognizing that in certain circumstances there is no doctor -patient relationship. A.24 Scope Of Practice These Guidelines do not address scope of practice or change the scope of practice. NYS WCB MTG - Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and Acute Stress Disorder 15 Post -Traumatic Stress Disorder and Acute Stress Disorder Effective date will coincide with the launch of OnBoard: Limited Release B. Overview B.1 PTSD/ASD: Definition Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Acute Stress Disorder (ASD) are psychiatric disorder s that can occur in people who have experienced or witnessed a traumatic or terrifying event. The types of trauma commonly associated with PTSD and ASD include experiencing an actual or potential severe injury, life threatening circumstances, a physical or sexual assault or other extreme social or natural events. Expe riencing or exposure to significant trauma is essential for the diagnosis of PTSD and ASD (DSM 5) Acute Stress Disorder occurs when symptoms persist for 3 to 30 days after a traumatic event. A PTSD diagnosis may be considered if symptoms persist or occur more than 30 days after a traumatic event There are many symptoms of PTSD. Although symptoms are common, the diagnosis of PTSD is relatively rare. The symptoms may include: Re-experiencing or flashbacks of event Unwanted, or intrusive memories Nightmares, or bad dreams Frightening thoughts Avoidance of settings that remind of the event(s) or experience(s) Avoiding thoughts or feelings of the event(s) Restlessness Being easily startled, hyperarousal Hypervigilance Feeling tense or on edge Feeling stressed Difficulty with sleeping Anger management issues, angry outbursts Negative thoughts about oneself or the world Distorted feelings - e.g., guilt, blame Trouble remembering key features of the traumatic event Loss of interest in enjoyable activities Alienation and/or detachment from friends and family B.2 Prognosis B.2.a ASD: Prognosis NYS WCB MTG - Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and Acute Stress Disorder 16 The diagnosis of ASD is not intended to predict subsequent PTSD, but rather to describe people with elevated distress in the initial month who may benefit from mental health services. This diagnosis is only a modest predictor of PTSD: at least half of people who develop PTSD do not initially meet the criteria for acute stress disorder. B.2.b PTSD: Prognosis PTSD is a complex phenomenon. Whil e the impact of PTSD on the lives of affected persons is significant, there is a notable body of evidence that indicates that PTSD may be successfully treated using established, evidenced based methods discussed below. Despite the complexities of PTSD, the prognosis is good with the vast majority of people recovering to lead productive lives. A minority (approx. 4 -22%) develop chronic PTSD. B.3 Treatment Overview B.3.a ASD Although the ASD diagnosis does not accurately predict chronic PTSD, it describes recently trauma -exposed people with severe distress. Provision of CBT in the acute phase is the best available strategy to limit subsequent PTSD. There may be occasional, subtle variations to treatment approaches, on a case -specific basis, when the provide r can justify such variation with a medically evidence -based rationale. B.3.b PTSD Psychological Management The primary initial intervention is CBT, which may include any or multiple of several methods or techniques. Exposure therapy (e.g., prolonged/exposure therapy, virtual reality training, Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) is often incorporated as part of CBT and also has evidence of efficacy, although it is less frequently prescribed. For all psychological/psychiatric interventions, there must be an assessment and treatment plan with measurable behavioral goals, time frames and specific interventions planned. B.3.c Pharmacological Management B.3.c.i ASD: Pharmacological Management Not Recommended - for the management of ASD. B.3.c.ii PTSD: Pharmacological Management Recommended - The primary non -psychological interventions are medications, and the strongest evidence is for SSRI and SNRI anti -depressants. Paroxetine and Sertraline are FDA for treatment of PTSD. NYS WCB MTG - Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and Acute Stress Disorder 17 C.

Recurrent, involuntary, and intrusive distressing memories of the traumatic event(s) 2. Recurrent distressing dreams in which the content and/or affect of the dream are related to the traumatic event(s) 3. Dissociative reactions (e.g., flashbacks) in which the individual feels or acts as if the traumatic event(s) were recurring (such reactions may occur on a continuum, with the most extreme expression being a compl ete loss of awareness of present surroundings) 4. Intense or prolonged psychological distress or marked physiological reactions in response to internal or external cues that symbolize or resemble an aspect of the traumatic event(s) Negative Mood 5. Persistent in ability to experience positive emotions (e.g., inability to experience happiness, satisfaction, loving feelings) Dissociative Symptoms 6. An altered sense of reality of one's surroundings or oneself (e.g., seeing oneself from another's perspective, being in a daze, time slowing) 7. Inability to remember an important aspect of the event(s) (typically due to dissociative amnesia and not to other factors such as head injury, alcohol, or drugs) Avoidance Symptoms 8. Efforts to avoid distressing memories, thoughts, or feelings about or closely associated with the traumatic event(s) 9. Efforts to avoid external reminders (e.g., people, places, conversations, activities, objects, situations) that arouse distressing memories, thoughts, or feelings about or closely associated with the traumatic event(s) Arousal Symptoms 10.

NYS WCB MTG - Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and Acute Stress Disorder 19 C.1 DSM -IV versus DSM -5: Clinical Practice Guideline Implications The diagnostic criteria for PTSD underwent substantial changes between the DSM -IV (published in 1994) and the DSM -5, which was published in 2013.W hen the diagnosis of PTSD was made under the DSM -IV criteria, prior to the publication of DSM -V criteria, these PTSD Treatment Guidelines apply to the care of the worker. Diagnosis of PTSD subsequent to the publication of the DSM -V criteria must be consistent with the DSM -V criteria. Summary: An injured worker with a prior diagnosis of PTSD under DSM -IV maintains the diagnosis of PTSD and should receive care consistent with these guidelines. D. History and Psychological / Psychiatric Examination D.1 Initial Assessment The initial assessment requires a comprehensive patient history. The initial step is to define the trauma exposure, ascertain its severity, and real or perceived immediacy to the patient. For ASD and/or PTSD, the severity sho uld involve either death, serious injury or sexual violence consistent with [DSM5 criteria]. Evaluation of topics such as current living situation, employment, education, social interaction levels, substance use, and childhood experience should all be considered. A thorough examination of both physical and mental symptoms is required. Types of Measures for PTSD Screening and Testing There are three basic types of psychological measures: (i) screening tools (ii) outcome measures and (iii) psychometric testing batteries (psychological inventories). Screening tools attempt to determine if there are symptoms/signs that a diagnosis might be present, and if so, supports the need for referral to a mental health/behavioral health professional to determine if the condition is present. A screening assessment is not definitive, but rather serves as an indication that further clinical evaluation is needed prior to making a definitive diagnosis. An outcome measure tracks changeable features of a condi tion which could potentially respond to treatment. After screening, patients who are thought to potentially have PTSD requiring treatment may be evaluated with a comprehensive evaluation and treated based on that evaluation. Some may undergo psychometric testing with psychological inventories Psychological inventories are multi -dimensional measures intended to provide a broad description of the patient, by measuring a constellation of traits deemed to be relevant to the psychological examination. For a history and psychological examination, the mental health/behavioral health professional may use the interview and one or more psychological/biopsychologcial inventories to assess personality traits, general NYS WCB MTG - Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and Acute Stress Disorder 20 signs of psychiatric syndromes, physical and psychological coping styles and social support and conflicts. E. Screening and Testing (Psychometric and Outcome) There are numerous screening and psychometric testing batteries. Although these instruments may suggest a diagnosis, neither screening nor psychometric tests are capable of making a diagnosis. The diagnosis should only be made after careful analysis of all available data, including from a thorough history and clinical interview. Each test must have a specific target and avoid duplication or overlap. Tests may be administered to monitor a patient's condition and progress. However, routine repeat testing is not indicated when the clinical documentation supports improved outcomes . The testing report sho uld integrate the test data with the specific treatment goals of the client. E.1 Psychological/Psychiatric Evaluation Recommended - for all patients with potential acute stress disorder or post - traumatic stress disorder. Indications - mental health evaluations are essential to make, secure and/or confirm a diagnosis. They also set the stage for subsequent treatment plans. Evaluation should especially include focus on ASD/PTSD, anxiety disorder(s), depression, substance use disorder(s) and risk of suicide. Frequency/Dose/Duration - Initial evaluation to diagnose. Subsequent visits for treatment include performance and interpretation of screening and diagnostic testing. E.2 ASD/PTSD Screening Tools Recommended - for the evaluation of patients with ASD and/or for potential of PTSD Indications - Patients with ASD and/or potential for PTSD, (those who have sustained an at-risk event). Benefits - Earlier identification of potential PTSD, with referral of the patient to appropriate mental health servic es that include diagnostic confirmation. Frequency/Dose/Duration - One screening visit. Since PTSD is a disorder with a fluctuating course for many individuals, repeat screening may be clinically indicated based upon delayed or changing symptoms. However routine screening is not recommended . Screening tools may include: PTSD Checklist, Primary Care PTSD Screen, and the Post-Traumatic Adjustment Scale NYS WCB MTG - Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and Acute Stress Disorder 21 E.3 Psychometric Testing: ASD/PTSD Recommended - for individuals presenting with a positive screen and/or signs and symptoms consistent with acute stress disorder or post -traumatic stress disorder. Indications - To assist mental health providers in confirming a diagnosis of ASD/PTSD or other related psychiatric mental health disorders. Requires administration by a professionally trained mental health professional Frequency/Dose/Duration - One-time test battery administration unless otherwise indicated. E.4 Outcome Measures Recommended to monitor a patient 's condition and progress. Rationale - Repeat testing is not indicated when the clinical documentation supports improved outcomes. The testing report should integrate the test data with the specific treatment goals of the client. Requires administration by a professionally trained mental health professional. Evidence for the Use of PTSD Screening Tools and Tests E.5 Functiona l MRI Not Recommended - for the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder. F. Treatment Recommendations F.1 Behavioral and Psychological Interventions For all psychological/psychiatric interventions, there must be an assessment and treatment plan with measurable behavioral goals, time frames and specific interventions planned. Psychological Intervention: Optimum duration three to six months. Maximum duration: nine to twelve months. For select patients longer supervision may be required and if further counseling is indicated, documentation of the nature of the psychological factors, as well as projecting a realistic functional prognosis should be provided by the treating practitioner every four weeks during treatment. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been used to treat PTSD. It includes a variety of component therapies including cognitive therapy, and various types of exposure therapy. Mind -body interventions are reviewed separately, although they are often used with CBT; mind -body in terventions attempt to achieve stress relief by encompassing a variety of techniques designed to use the mind to impact physical functioning and improve health. NYS WCB MTG - Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and Acute Stress Disorder 22 F.1.a Trauma Focused Psychotherapies Trauma-focused psychotherapy is defined as any th erapy that uses cognitive, emotional or behavioral techniques to facilitate processing a traumatic experience and in which the trauma focuses is a central component of the therapeutic process. F.1.a.i Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (including Cognitive Processing Therapy, Imagery Rehearsal Training, Brief Eclectic Psychotherapy, Narrative Exposure therapy and EMDR) Recommended - for the treatment of patients with ASD and PTSD Frequency/Dose/Duration - Weekly to twice -weekly sessions of 60-100 minutes, generally a minimum of six weeks and up to three months. Indications for Discontinuation - Resolution of PTSD symptoms, non-compliance, lack of efficacy, or adverse effects Evidence for the Use of Cognitive Behavioral Therapies F.1.a.ii Exposure Therapy and Prolonged Exposure Therapy Exposure therapy involves the use of a variety of exercises which make a patient confront a traumatic memory and reorganize it. This often includes: 1) introducing the visual confrontat ion of the trauma and 2) repeatedly visiting the trauma memory. Exposure therapies are often combined with CBT. This may be done through virtual reality exposure, imaginal exposure, narrative exposure, in vivo exposure to a traumatic event, and/or virtual reality exposure (reviewed separately). Prolonged Exposure Therapy (PE) is a treatment that involves forced visual confrontation of trauma -related stimuli. Recommended - for the treatment of patients with PTSD. Indications - PTSD symptoms sufficient to require therapy. Benefits - Improvement in PTSD symptoms and reduced emotional response to traumatic stimuli and to help emotionally process a traumatic experience Frequency/Dose/Duration - Weekly 90 -minute sessions for ten weeks with reevaluation every four weeks with documented efficacy in terms of improved PTSD symptoms and functional improvement. NYS WCB MTG - Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and Acute Stress Disorder 23 Indications for Discontinuation - Resolution of symptoms, non - compliance, lack of efficacy or adverse events. Evidence for the Use of Exposure Therapy and Prolonged Exposure Therapy F.1.a.ii.a Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy Recommended - in the treatment of patients with PTSD. Indications - PTSD symptoms sufficient to require therapy. Frequency/Dose/Duration - Once to twice weekly 90 minutes sessions for five weeks with reevaluation every four weeks with documented efficacy in terms of improved PTSD symptoms and functional improvement. Indications for Discontinuation - Resolution of symptoms, non -compliance, adverse effects or lack of efficacy for PTSD. Evidence for the Use of Virtual Reality F.1.a.iii Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR): Exposure Therapy and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Components of Treatment Recommended - for the treatment of patients with PTSD Rationale - EMDR includes multiple therapies, or co-interventions, including those known to be effective (e.g., cognitive behavioral therapy, exposure therapy) . Evidence for the Use of Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing G. Non-Trauma Focused Psychotherapy Although evidence supports the use of trauma -focused psychotherapies for the treatment of PTSD, not all patients are willing to participate in treatments that may focus on their trauma to any extent. As a result, some practitioners utilize non - trauma -focused therapies. Non -trauma -focused ther apies for patients diagnosed with PTSD include: Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT), Stress Inoculation Training (SIT), Present -Centered Therapy (PCT). NYS WCB MTG - Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and Acute Stress Disorder 24 G.1 Interpersonal Psychotherapy Recommended - for the treatment of patients with chronic PTSD Indications - Chronic PTSD sufficiently symptomatic to require treatment. Frequency/Dose/Duration - Weekly interpersonal psychotherapy for 14 weeks; 50 minutes per weekly session with reevaluation every four weeks with documented efficacy in terms of improved PTSD symptoms and functional improvement. .

Evidence for the Use of Interpersonal Therapy G.1.a Stress Inoculation Training Recommended G.1.b Seeking Safety Not Recommended G.1.c Dialectical Behavioral Therapy Not Recommended H. Mind/Body Interventions Mind/body interventions have been used for PTSD patients to attempt to relieve stress and encompass techniques such as guided imagery and mindfulness designed to use the mind to impact physical functioning. H.1 Mind/Body Interventions: Yoga Recommended - in select patients with PTSD as second line treatment. Indications - PTSD sufficient to require alternate therapies after first line PTSD psychotherapy. CBT should generally be tried first. Often yoga is used in combination as an adjunct with other therapies such as CBT and/or medication. Evidence for the Use of Yoga NYS WCB MTG - Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and Acute Stress Disorder 25 H.2 Mind/Body Interventions: Guided Imagery Recommended - for the treatment of patients with PTSD. H.3 Mind/Body Interventions: Mindfulness Recommended - for the treatment of patients with PTSD. Evidence for the Use of Mind/Body Interventions I. Medications In general it is recommended that medications be continued for one year post -remission before considering medication tapering, although decision s regarding duration of therapy are made on a case -specific basis. NOTE: It is vitally important that prescribers appreciate the potential for drug -drug interactions and the potential for one prescription to significantly increase the likelihood that a patient will experience adverse side -effects when multiple medications are being prescribed. This is particularly true for any medication that is potentially sedating, a respiratory depressant, habit forming or addictive . Therefore, extreme caution should be exercised whenever one is considering prescribing more than one medication with these properties. NOTE: For patient s with certain long -term psychiatric illnesses, who are on stable doses of ongoing pharmacologic therapy, stable and uninterrupted dosing can be critical. Therefore, when clinically appropriate, prescribers may consider writing prescriptions with two to six monthly refills, in order to reduce the likelihood of prescriptions expiring between monthly to tri-monthly follow -up appointments.

They were assigned to feign either an automobile accident or sexual assault under either honest or malingering conditions. Age/Sex: Mean age: 25.6 years; 119 males, 36 females Diagnoses: PTSD Comparison: TSI under honest conditions (N=155) vs TSI under malingering conditions (N=155) Results: Elevated on all subscales, F(10,144) = 60.56, p<0.0001.

Conclusion: \"In this study, using an analogue design to experimentally manipulate honest and malingered responses on the TSI, we found that proposed ATR cut scores produce a significant risk of false positives. Furthermore, the functioning of proposed cut scores worsened when we used posttraumatic stress disorder relevant samples and low estimates of malingering base rates. In light of these findings, the TSI should be used with caution when assessing claims of p osttraumatic stress in forensic or disability settings.\" Comments: Data suggest TSI should be used cautiously to asses PTSD claims in forensic or disability settings.

Comparison: PE group: received 10 to 12 sessions of prolonged exposure therapy with 80 minutes per session (n=18) vs. PCT group: received 10 to 12 sessions of present - centered therapy with 80 minutes per session (n=18). Follow -up: No mention of specific follow -up time length. Results: 91% of the PE group indicated significant reductions in their CAPS score (from 79.2\u00b112.1 pretest to 30.0\u00b118.4 posttest), and 60% of the also indicated reduction (from 77.4\u00b112.1 pretest to 53.6\u00b128.7). No significant difference was found between time and treatment for the CAPS scores change (p=0.08). Conclusion: \"Both increased cortisol response to personal trauma script prior to PTSD therapy and reductions in cognitive symptoms of PTSD were significantly and uniquely related to reductions in the core symptoms of PTSD in PE.\" Comments: PE was associated with a significantly higher number of PTSD symptom reduction than PCT (p=0.008). Data also suggest that cortisol measures likely are not related to changes in cognition.

Age/Sex: Mean age: 36.1 years; 15 males, females. Comparison: Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) (n=29) patients underwent 90 minute individual session. Sessions for 8 NYS WCB MTG - Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and Acute Stress Disorder 200 weeks Vs Fluoxetine (n=30) treatment consisted of 20-30 minute individual sessions for 8 weeks. Starting Fluoxetine dosage was 10 mg/day and was increased 10 mg to max of 60 mg/day for 8 weeks. Vs. Placebo (N = 29) - treatment consisted of 20 -30 minute individual sessions. Starting placebo dosage was 10 mg/day and was increased 10 mg to max of 60 mg/day for 8 weeks. Follow -up: 6 months Results: The CAPS total score, mean (SD) for the EMDR group is adult -onset versus 33.3% of child -onset trauma subjects receiving EMDR achieved asymptomatic end-state functioning compared with none in the fluoxetine group. Conclusion: \"This study supports the efficacy of brief EMDR treatment to produce substantial and sustained reduction of PTSD and depression in most victims of adult -onset trauma. It suggests a role for SSRIs as a reliable first-line intervention to achieve moderate symptom relief for adult victims of childhood -onset trauma. \" Comments: Data suggest psychotherapy (EMDR) more effective in providing sustained improvement in PTSD symptoms compared to fluoxetine and placebo.

Age/Sex: Mean age: 37 years; 15 males, 45 females. Comparison: Each randomized to eight 90 minute individual sessions of exposure therapy (n=22) vs. eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) (n=19) vs. relaxation therapy (n=19) Follow -up: Follow up at 3 months. Results: Outcome measured via CAPS scores. For each of the four dimensions evaluated (re -experiencing, avoidance, numbing, hyperarousal) reductions in CAPS scores were significant: relaxation group - t(14) > 3.55 (p < 0.005, n2 > n2 > 0.49), exposure therapy - t(14) > 4.52 < 0.001, n2 > 0.59) Conclusion: \"Compared with EMDR and relaxation training, exposure therapy (a) produced significantly larger reductions in avoidance and reexperiencing symptoms, (b) tended to be faster at reducing avoidance, and (c) tended to yield a greater proportion of participants who no longer met criteria for PTSD after treatment. EMDR and relaxation did not differ from one another in speed or efficacy.\" Comments: Data suggest exposure therapy superior to both EMDR and relaxation training in reducing avoidance or recurring symptoms, but there was similar efficacy on all other measures.

NYS WCB MTG - Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and Acute Stress Disorder 203 Evidence for the Use of Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing Thought field therapy (TFT), also known as the Callahan technique, is a therapeutic tool used to attempt to relieve anxiety and other symptoms [293, 294]. TFT is an approach developed from a mix of three modalities and theories: acupuncture, chiropractic, and psychotherapy [295]. A typical TFT session will involve tapping on the face, hand, and body while the patient pr oduces feelings, thoughts, or memories that are the target for treatment (e.g., anxiety, sadness, and restlessness) [293, 294]. Each TFT session will include a set of protocol or algorithm, which designates the specific acupoint to be tapped, as well as th e order in which they are to be tapped. Symptoms of PTSD, such as hyperarousal, dissociation, and defensive avoidance, are targeted using a trauma treatment protocol [293 -295].

Follow -up: 6 months. Results: Rates of relapse were 22% for FLU versus 50% for PBO (P = 0.029), and time to relapse on FLU was longer than for PBO (P = 0.02, log - rank statistic). The estimated relative risk for relapse was 1.55 (1.03, 2.35) on PBO, and 0.44 (0.20, 0.98) for FLU. Conclusion: \"Thus, our study supports the ability of continuation and maintenance therapy with FLU to protect against relapse in PTSD, albeit not in a uniform manner on all ratings. The drug is well tolerated, and no pretreatment variables that we recorded predicted relapse. Although this is the largest single -center trial of relapse prevention in PTSD, the relatively small sample size limits statistical power.\" Comments: High dropout rate with small sample.

Author Year (Score): George 2014 (score=5.0) Category: rTranscranial Magnetic Stimulation Study type: RCT Conflict of Interest: Supported by U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command. No COI. Sample size: N = 41 patients Source of Trauma: Suicide attempt Age/Sex: Mean age: 42.5\u00b1 15.7; 35 males, females. Comparison: Active Group: received 10 Hz of rTMS for 5 sec train, 10 sec intertrain intervals for 30 min sessions 3 times daily for 3 days (n=20) Vs. Sham: received sham rTMS that used a metal insert to block magnetic field and electrodes on the scalp to deliver matched somatosensory sensation (n=21) Follow -up: Follow up for 6 months. Results: From the mITT analyses, SSI scores declined rapidly over the 3 days for both groups (sham change -15.3 points, active change -15.4 points), with a trend for more rapid decline on the first day with active rTMS (sham change -6.4 points, active -10.7 points, P = 0.12). This decline was more pronounced in the completers subgroup [sham change = 0.054]. Subjective ratings of 'being bothered by thoughts of suicide' declined non -significantly more with active rTMS than with sham at the end of 9 sessions of treatment in the mITT analysis [sham change of left prefrontal rTMS over three days (54,000 stimuli) to suicidal inpatients is possible and safe, with few side effects and no worsening of suicidal thinking. The suggestions of a rapid anti-suicide effect (day 1 SSI data, Visual Analogue Scale data over the 3 days) need to be tested for replication in a larger sample.\" Comments: Pilot study. 3 day trial only suggesting high dose of rTMS is safe for suicidal inpatients. NYS WCB MTG - Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and Acute Stress Disorder 265 Author Year (Score): Cohen 2004 (score=5.0) Category: rTranscranial Magnetic Stimulation Study type: RCT Conflict of Interest: Supported by a grant from the Israel Defense Force. No mention of COI. Sample size: N = 24 patients with PTSD Source of Trauma: Included: military service, motor vehicle accident, sexual and nonsexual assault, death of relative, work accidents. Age/Sex: Mean age: 41.8 years; 17 males, 7 females. Comparison: Group 1: (n=6) Sham rTMS received 20 min treatments over 10 work days Vs. Group 2: (n=8) received slow frequency rTMS (1Hz per 5 seconds of train) Vs. Group 3: received high frequency rTMS (10 Hz per 2 seconds of train)(n=10) Follow -up: Follow up 14 days after the end of treatment Results: The 10 daily treatments of 10- Hz rTMS at 80% motor threshold over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex had therapeutic effects on PTSD patients. PTSD core symptoms (re -experiencing, avoidance) markedly improved with this treatment. Moreover, high -frequency rTMS over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in PTSD patients. Conclusion: \"This double -blind, controlled trial suggests that in PTSD patients, 10 daily sessions of right dorsolateral prefrontal rTMS at a frequency of 10 Hz have greater therapeutic effects than slow - frequency or sham stimulation.\" Comments: Short term trial (2 weeks). Data suggest rTMS at 10 Hz improved core PTSD symptoms. Author Year (Score): Rosenberg 2002 (score=3.0) Category: rTranscranial Magnetic Stimulation Comments: No blinding. No sham. Small sample open label trial. Antidepressant use was uncontrolled and variable. Short treatment time - only 10 days. Data suggest possible benefit of rTMS for depression, insomnia, anxiety and hostility but core PTSD symptoms improved minimally if at all. Results sustained for 2 months in 9/12 completers for depression. Evidence for the Use of Acupuncture Author Year (Score): Engel 2014 (score=7.0) Category: Acupuncture Study type: RCT Conflict of Interest: Sponsored by the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS) under Award No. MDA905 -03-C-0003. No COI. No COI. Sample size: N = 55 active duty military personnel with PTSD. Source of Trauma: Combat -related. Age/Sex: Mean 38 females. Comparison: Acupuncture (n=28) Patients received usual PTSD care plus eight 60-minute sessions of acupuncture conducted twice weekly. Vs. Usual PTSD Care (n=27) Patients received the usual PTSD care only. Follow -up: 4, 8, and 12 weeks. NYS WCB MTG - Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and Acute Stress Disorder 266 Results: Statistically significant differences favoring acupuncture were found between the 2 treatment groups for the primary outcome, PCL (w2/3 =97.8, P < 0.0001), and for CAPS (w2/3 =9.2, P < 0.05). Mean PCL score significantly decreased in the acupuncture with UPC group at 4 weeks (58.1 \u00b1 11.4 vs. 38.8 \u00b1 11.6; t241 \"Acupuncture was effective for reducing PTSD symptoms. Limitations included small sample size and inability to parse specific treatment mechanisms. Larger multisite trials with longer follow -up, comparisons to standard PTSD treatments, and assessments of treatment acceptability are needed. Acupuncture is a novel therapeutic option that may help to improve population reach of PTSD treatment.\" Comments: Usual care bias. Data suggest improved PTSD symptoms severity in acupuncture group. Author Year (Score): Prisco 2013 (score=4.5) Category: Acupuncture Study type: RCT Conflict of Interest: No COI. Sponsored by a grant from the Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Health Administration, Office of Research and Development, Health Services Research and Development, NRI-08- 121. Sample size: N = 35 veterans with PTSD. Source of Trauma: Combat -related. Age/Sex: Mean age: 37.8 years; 25 males, 10 females. Comparison: True acupuncture (n=8) participants were offered two true acupuncture treatments per week for 18 consecutive weeks for a total of 16 treatments. Vs Sham acupuncture (n=8) participants were offered two sham acupuncture treatments per week for 18 consecutive weeks for a total of 16 treatments. Vs. Wait -list control (n=9) participants received conventional care. Follow -up: 1 and 2 months. Results: Subjects in the true auricular acupuncture group had a statistically significant improvement (p = 0.0165) in sleep quality as measured by the ISI at time (t) = 1 month. This group had a trend toward lower MSD TST at t = 2 months (p = 0.078), lower WA TST at t = 1 month (p = 0.0893), and toward higher MSD nap times than the other two groups post -treatment (p = 0.0666). Conclusion: \"Acupuncturists should consider incorporating sleep hygiene education into their clinical practices and/or collaborate with insomnia health care professionals when working with individuals with insomnia. This study also supports the finding that perceived sleep quality and objective WA measurements are not significantly correlated.\" Comments: Waitlist control bias, however had sham group. Auricular acupuncture. Small sample sizes. Data show inconsistent results between groups and over time. "}
