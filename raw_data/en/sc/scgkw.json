Foreword from the Chair an d Chief Executive Welcome to our annual report and accounts for 2018/19. Foreword from the Chair and Chief Executive Welcome to The Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust's Annual Report for the period 1st April 2018 to 31st March 2019. To note that the Trust is the corporate trustee to The Walton Centre Charity and has assessed its relationship to the Charity as a subsidiary. The annual report has been prepared on a 'group basis' in line with the treatment of the final accounts. About The Walton Centre The Walton Centre was established in 1992 and attained Foundation Trust status on 1st August 2009. It is the only standalone neurosciences Trust in the UK and serves a patient population of circa 3.5 million from Merseyside, Cheshire, Lancashire, Greater Manchester, the Isle of Man and North Wales. The Walton Centre was inspected by the C are Quality Commission (CQC) in April 2016. The Trust was given an Outstanding rating in October 2016, maki ng it the first specialist NHS T rust in the country to be given the rating without hav ing any areas deemed as 'requiring improvement'. The report hig hlighted many examples where staff had 'gone the extra mile' to support patients' individual needs, that there was a positive culture throughout the Trust, and that staff were highly -skilled and committed. Recognising that the NHS is facing a period of pr ofound change, the new strategy for The Walton Centre continues to put patients at the heart of delivering care and focuses on six key ambitions : Deliver best practice care and treatments in our specialist field. Provide more services closer to patients' homes, driven by the needs of our communities, extending partnership working. Be financially strong, meeting our targets and investing in our services, facilities and innovations for patients and staff. Lead research, education and innovation, pioneering n ew treatments nationally and internationally. Adopt advanced technology and treatments enabling our teams to deliver excellent patient and family centred care. Be recognised as excellent in our patient and family centred care, clinical outcomes, innovation and staff wellbeing. BBC Hospital In Autumn 2018, the production company Label 1 filmed patient stories in the Trust, which resulted in a full episode of the latest series of BBC Two's flagship medical programme 'Hospital' being focused on The 7 Walton Cent re. The episode highlighted the fantastic care provided by Walton Centre staff and raised the profile of the Trust. The episode was well received and viewed by over 2.3 million people. Cheshire and Merseyside Rehabilitation Network ( CMRN ) Five Year Celebration In March 2019 the Cheshire and Merseyside Rehabilitation Network (CMRN), led by The Walton Centre, celebrated its five-year anniversary. Over 120 clinicians, patients and visitors gathered at the Trust to share stories and learning f rom the network. Open Scanner R eplacement Autumn 2018 saw the departure of the T rust's O pen (Ovation) 0.35 Tesla scanner, which was installed in December 2008 and used for the claustrophobia clinic, as well as for other patients. It scanned nearly 30,000 times in its lifetime. It was replaced by a more efficient wide bore MR scanner. ITU Garden Room Work began in 2018 to create a unique garden room in the hospital's ITU. This is essentially a separate pavilion type building with a single patient bay, surrounded by a landscaped courtyard. The aim is for ventilated patients to receive treatment and recover in a calming e nvironment. The room should be available for use in April 2019. The Walton Centre Charity During the year, the Charity continued to go from strength to strength. Community support grew steadily and in addition to raising awareness, the Charity also rai sed funds for specific purposes such as the Home from Home Fund to support the annual costs of the relatives' accommodation; and the Sid Watkins Innovation Fund which enabled the Trust to purchase a Robotic Arm - a state -of-the-art piece of equipment to su pport a number of neurosurgical procedures. PLACE Report The Walton Centre excelled again in the national Patient -led Assessment of Care Environment (PLACE) inspection. The Walton Centre's average across the six main domains of the assessment was 96.23% which made it the third highest performing specialist Trust in the country and gave us a ranking of 15th out of all NHS Trusts across England. Our results were over 7% higher than the national average. Improving Quality Significant work has been undertaken to improve the quality of care to both patients and their families. In line with the Trust's strategy, we have continued to engage with staff, patients and families through varied opportunities including Safety Huddle, Hayley's Huddle, Berwick Sessions, S chwartz Rounds, Staff Listening Events and patient and family engagement. The Trust has continued to reduce hospital acquired pressure ulcers and hospital acquired infections. 8 Catheter Associated Urinary Tract Infections (CAUTI): The Trust has seen a reduction in patients experiencing CAUTIs from 23 in 2017/18 to 16 in 2018 - 2019 against an internal reduction target of 30 and we aim to reduce cases further during 2019 - 2020 with our comprehensive education programme. Methicillin -resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) There is zero tolerance at both national level and internally within the Trust. The embedded learning across the Trust to improve patient safety has ensured the Trust has had zero MRSAs during 2018/19 Methicillin -sensitive Staphylococcus Aureus (MSSA) There were 10 patients with MSSA against an internal target of 9. All cases were investigated and learning opportunities shared across the Trust. We aim to reduce MSSA during 2019 -2020 and have set an in ternal target of no more than 9 cases. The Trust achieved all Quality Account priorities, which highlighted the continued motivation and enthusiasm of staff to achieve a reduction in harm thus ena bling enhanced patient safety and experience. Health and Wel lbeing As a Health and Wellbei ng exemplar T rust, The Walton Centre has continued to offer a range of benefits and support to staff to promote physical and mental wellbeing, and was awarded the Health@Work Workplace Wellbeing Charter following an independe nt assessment. Director of Workforce and Innovation Mike Gibney and Jane Mullin, Deputy Director of HR, have spoken at national conferences and events to share insights and advice about Health and Wellbeing provision with other NHS trusts and organisations . The Trust was also reaccredited with the Investors In People Gold Standard, reflecting the strong supportive culture staff have created. This year staff have had the opportunity to take part in Schwartz Rounds, discussion forums for staff to share experiences and reflections of working in a healthcare setting; Berwick Sessions, engagement events for all staff groups built around a new theme each time; a range of exercise classes and health and wellbeing events. Staff from The Walton Centre have helped to create an app to improve daily wellbeing and resilience during work this is the first in the NHS. Working in partnership with Shiny Mind, a company which has delivered wellbeing and resilience training to over 1500 staff in more than 20 NHS Trusts, staff from all levels of the organisation have helped to develop an app, which allows users to send and r eceive messages of encouragement and positivity. The app provides interactive exercises and support aimed to reduce stress and increase wellbeing. It also gives staff coping skills and access to the resources 24 hours a day, seven days a week. 9 The app is available to all our Walton Centre staff to download f or free. Acknowledgements The Trust Board would like to pay tribute to the hard work and dedication of staff and the invaluable assistance provided by many supporters, including volunteers, support grou ps, charitabl e groups, fundraisers, members, governors, current and previous patients. Special thanks go to everyone who contributed to the development of the Trust's new five year strategy, helping to set our direction for the future. The Board of Direct ors is responsible for ensuring the production of the Trust's annual report and accounts and considers this document, taken as a whole, to be fair, balanced and understandable, and provides the information necessary for patients, regulators and other stak eholders to assess The Walton Centre's performance, business model and strategy. Hayley Citrine , Chief Executive Janet Rosser, Chair 24 May 2019 24 May 2019 This report was approved and adopted by the Board of Directors on 24 May 2019 . The Trust's 2018/19 accounts have been prepared under a direction issued by Monitor under the National Health Service Act 2006. 10 2i. Performance Report - overview of performance Principal Purpose Our vision is: Excellence in Neuroscience. Our Purpose is: Dedicated specialist staff leading future treatment and excellent clinical outcomes for brain, spinal and neurological care nationally and internationally. Our vision is what we strive for and our purpose is what we do. Our purpose has been chosen by our staff to reflect our culture, what we believe in and what we strive to deliver for our patients and their families. To deliver our vision and to meet our purpose , we have through consultation agreed a set of ambitions together. The Walton Way To meet our ambitions, we need to ensure a learning culture that empowers staff to believe they can make and lead change, be curious and seek continuous improvement. We want all staff to feel comfortable being open and honest, treating patients and each other with dignity and respect and we do this through our Walton way values; Dignity, Respect, Caring, Pride and Openness. Our staff were keen to keep the Walton way values, w hich they helped design, to underpin the T rust strategy and they remain core to everything that we do. Strategic Objectives 11 1.

The progress made against the Trust's 5 year strategy (2018 -2023) was recently reviewed and shared with all staff and key stakeholders. This showed that the Trust was performing well aga inst the six objectives it had set . Increasingly, we are working as the hub for a network of services provided in hospitals and community locations across Merseyside, Cheshire, North Wales and the wider North West - the Cheshire and Merseyside Major Trauma Centre Collaborative, Cheshire and Merseyside Rehabilitation Network, our neurology services provided in 34 locations, and the developing spinal surgery network. This also includes supporting GPs and hospitals to manage patients with neurological conditio ns better locally, without referring to the specialist centre. Following the publication of the NHS Five Year Forward View (5YFV) in 2014 a Vanguard Programme was set up by NHS England to test different approaches to fulfilling the Triple Aim with its f ocus on population health, effective care and per capita cost. The NHS invited individual organisations and partnerships to apply to become pilot sites for the new care models (NCMs) programme. The Cheshire and Merseyside Neuro Network was selected as one of the acute care collaboration sites. The programme has been evaluated and come to an end however the success of the programme has been captured throughout Cheshire and Merseyside with the Neurosciences Programme, being a key programme reports to the Cheshire and Merseyside Health and care partnership programme. Business, Activity and Performance Throughout 2018/19 , the Trust has remained in a strong position on quality and performance. Through the Trust's two divisions - Neurosurgery and Neuro logy, it continues to deliver excellent care to patients in a timely manner. The Division of Neurosurgery is responsible for: 12 Neurosurgery Anaesthetics Theatres Surgical wards Critical Care Pain Medicine Pain Management Programme Neuroscience Laboratories Day Case Unit Advanced Neurosurgery Nurses Advanced Pain Medicine Nurses Cancer Services Major Trauma Service Clinical Audit and Outcomes Teaching and Training across the specialities within the division The Division of Neurolog y is responsible for: Neurology ; hub and partner outpatient service, day cases and inpatient ward s Therapies Integrated Neurology Nurses Disease specific Specialist Nurses Neurophysiology Neuropsychiatry Neuropsychology Pharmacy Service L evel Agreement Patient Access Centre Outpatient Department Medical Secretariat Complex Rehabilitation Network Neuror adiology Clinical Audit and Outcomes Thrombectomy 13 Division of Neurosurgery Within the Neurosurgery Service there are 20 Consultant Neurosurgeons, 2 Consultant Orthopaedic surgeons and 25 Specialist Nurses working alongside Allied Health Professionals (AHPs) to deliver specialist services at the centre and at nine satellites sites at partner Trusts across Cheshire and Merseyside, Isle of Man and Wales. Within the Pain Medicine Service there are 7 Consultants in Pain Medicine and 5 Specialist Nurses again supported by AHP's to deliver a highly specialised pain service on site enhan ced by joint specialist clinics working with Liverpool Womens, Aintree and Alder Hey Hospitals . Neur osurgery The department continues to be one of the busiest neurosurgical units in the country, seeing 10,600 new patients, 4,000 elective, and 1,800 emerge ncy inpatients during 2018/19. Achievement of the Referral to Treat (RTT) target has been a particular challenge, with the impact of the national Paper Switch Off initiative for GP referrals. This saw the number of referrals fall for the first time in many years. While, RTT achievement was not maintained, we are on track with our performance improvement trajectory which should see achievement of the RTT standard by Spring 2019. During the year we continued to support the population of a local hospital, who have temporarily suspended their spinal service. The number of emergency referrals also continues to increase year on year. In 2018/19 almost 10,000 referrals were received by the on -call team , compared to almost 9,000 in 2017/18. In 2017/18 we employed two emergency admission co -ordinators to provide the clinical teams with valuable support and also improved the speed at which calls are dealt with and response times for our referrers. We are now exploring the option to allow referrers to electronically r efer to further improve the process and timeliness. We received accreditation as a EUROSPINE Surgical Spinal Centre of Excellence for all spinal pathologies, following an audit of our spinal service in March 2019. EUROSPINE developed the Europe - wide qualit y certification programme for spinal service providers which aims to audit and certify the services that advance spine surgery and spine care as a whole. The ultimate goal would be to enhance treatment quality in spine surgery and to provide guidance for p atients with spinal disorders by displaying centres of a certain quality. The Trust has engaged with partners from across the Cheshire and Merseyside region to explore how spinal services are provided with the aim of establishing a single spinal surgical s ervice for the adult population of Cheshire and Merseyside, delivering the recommendations set out by Getting it Right First Time (GiRFT) national project. The work involves the assessment of options on potential clinical models and associated pathways of a single spinal service and regional spinal on -call emergency rota. 14 The Neurosurgical Division maintains a high national presence with Mr Paul May, Consultant Neurosurgeon, immediate past president of the Society of British Neurological Surgeons (SBNS), M iss Gilkes, Consultant Neurosurgeon SBNS Meetings Secretary and member of the Executive Council of the SBNS and Mr Marco Teli, Consultant Orthopaedic Surgeon is the SBNS Treasurer. Mr Pigott , Consultant Neurosurgeon was also appointed as President of Euros pine in October 2018. The demand for our deformity service continues to increase and we were delighted to expand our Orthopaedic workforce by welcoming Mr Narendra Rath, Consultant Orthopaedic surgeon in August 2018. We expanded the number of satellite sit es with the addition of our first Extended Scope Practitioner Physiotherapist satellite site in St Helens and Consultant spinal clinics at Arrow Pa rk and Aintree H ospitals. In addition, our first neurosurgery satellite clinic in North Wales is due to comme nce in April 2019. Miss Catherine Gilkes, Consultant Neurosurgeon will be providing a monthly clinic at Glan Clwyd hospital, to avoid patients having to travel to Liverpool. Investment was made in an Metastic Spinal Cord Compression (MSCC ) co-ordinator ro le within the spinal service to review patient pathways, improve staff training and education and promote best practice. Improvements have been made with regards to: Pathway development. A draft MSCC pathway has been developed internally, promot ing closer working relationships with oncology services, enabling rapid access to palliative care services for appropriate pain assessments and smooth transition from surgical to oncological care Orthosis management. An education video developed for clinic ians, patients and carers across the region and standardised orthosis weaning regimes developed. The spinal team are also planning an orthosis study day for professionals, to support training and developments. Patient Information. A new patient informati on pack detailing discharge summaries, surgical information booklet, physiotherapy advice / prescriptions, contact information and details of forthcoming appointments. MSCC database development. This will enable MSCC outcomes to be collected and audited allowing continuous clinical and service review and publications. Since the establishment of the Major Trauma Centre Collaborative between Aintree and The Walton Centre in 2012, continual progress has been recognised both locally and nationally. At the Nati onal Conference for Major Trauma in November 2018, The Cheshire & Merseyside Major Trauma Centre Collaborative (MTCC) was recognised as the second best Major Trauma Centre in the Country according to TARN patient outcomes. The last 12 months has seen gre at success, with many areas of good practice and significant achievements recognised by the Operational Delivery Network at the annual review in November 2018, including improvement in the provision of Neuropsychology services as a result of investment to support our trauma patient cohort. Improved pathways have resulted from new MTCC referral documentation, 15 establishment of head injury referral guidelines, the introduction of a collaborative MDT meeting and the appointment of Mr Nick Carleton -Bland as Spin al Lead for the Major Trauma service. We held our first regional Trauma conference in March 2019, which was a huge success and attended by over 100 attendee's from all disciplines. We also successfully recruited a Head Injury Advanced Practitioner and are leading on the development of the first electronic rehabilitation prescription for major trauma patients. We have invested in an Outpatient Antimicrobial Therapy (OPAT) Service, wi th the first clinic due to commence in May 2019. This service will provide consistency in patient follow -up, antibiotic duration, blood monitoring, dosing, and imaging requirements for medically stable patients who have been discharged on intravenous (IV) antibiotic therapy. This eliminates the need to admit patients whose only reason to stay in hospital is to receive IV antibiotic therapy. The provision of an OPAT service is nationally supported with evidence -based positive outcomes. It improves the exper ience of patients and their families and reduces inpatient length of stay and admissions related to inappro priate antibiotic cessation. We have developed an enhanced role for surgical practitioners, adding a greater level of assistance during neurosurgical procedures. The 'Walton Surgical Assistant' Project was created because of the need for assistance during the initial stages of surgery. Scrub Practitioners who are eligible for the training have a dedicated consultant mentor, who guides them through gaining the skills needed to assist in surgery. This additional set of skills provides greater efficiency in the operating room and provides essential development opportunities for eligible staff. Following on from the success of the major inciden t simulation exercise in 2017, a small working group has continued to meet and plan major incident and mass casualty -based scenarios; continuously reviewing events that have taken place across the country and capturing key learning points. In May 2018, The Walton Centre took part for the first time, in a regional desktop Major Incident Exercise facilitated by Public Health England, in which all trauma units, NWAS & NHSE participated. In June 2018, The Walton Centre undertook a desktop exercise, testing the resilience of our t heatre department, critical care unit and our collaborative working with our major trauma partners Aintree University Hospital. In 2018, the Major Incident Policy was reviewed and updated, and now incorporates all elements of learning from the above exercises. Additionally, two members of staff qualified as major incident simulation facilitators and there is also a rolling programme for scribe training. Anaesthesia and Critical Care The anaesthetic department maintained their Anaesthesi a Clinical Services Accreditation (ACSA) from the Royal College of Anaesthetists (RCoA) in 2018. ACSA is the RCoA's peer -reviewed scheme which promotes quality improvement and the highest standards of patient experience, patient safety and clinical leaders hip within anaesthetic services. ACSA accreditation was first awarded to our anaesthetic 16 department in 2017 ; we were the eighth in the North of England and the seventeenth in the UK to receive the prestigious accreditation and continue to develop the servi ce for the benefit of patients and staff. In line with our strategy to combat the national shortage of medical staffing across all specialties, we have expanded the number of Advanced Critical Care Nurse Practitioners (ACCPs) from 4.50 WTE to 6.00 WTE, in year. This will provide 24/7 ACCP cover once all individuals have completed their formal training. The department was also granted permission by the Royal College of Anaesthetists to recruit Anaesthetic Trainees from developing countries. The Medical Train ing Initiative programme has to date seen 5 additional junior doctors employed via this programme. We have invested in a dedicated Acute Pain Service and recruitment for an Acute Pain Nurse is underway. This is to compliment the previous investment in an Acute Pain Anaesthetic Consultant Lead and the prescribing capabilities within the Trust with the recruitment of prescribing Pharmacists and Nurse Specialists undertaking the Non Medical Prescribing course . However, ward rounds still take place without the ability to prescribe and an audit highlighted instances of inadequate pain relief for some of our inpatient s. This will reduce patients experiencing unmanaged acute post procedure pain in the context of ever increasing complexity of surgical capabilities. This also address es the findings within the ACSA review and work s towards the recommended guidelines for the Provision of Anaesthesia Se rvices (GPAS) for Acute Pain Services 2017 published by the Royal College of Anaesthetists. The Trust has partially met (4 of 5 triggers) the ITU Delayed Discharge 3rd year CQUIN. In the first two years of the CQUIN we saw discharge within 4 hours increase from only 41% to over 60% by the end of March 2018. This year we have changed the starting point for our CQUIN collection after it came to light we were recording the time from when the decision to discharge was made rather than when the patient w as clinically fit for discharge, as where other Trusts. This has prevented us from comparing our performance in previous years however; we met the required percentage within 4 hours set by our commissioners. The trigger which was no t met in 18/19 related t o the percentage of discharges greater than 24 hours. This was due to the complex requirements of some of our patients being discharged from ITU to an acute ward. Pain Medicine Activity growth continues within the service seeing over 5,400 new patients in 2018/19 and 1,900 elective inpatient admissions. To cope with the increase in demand , the department have looked at alter native ways support the additional patient . The team has expanded the multi -disciplinary team by a further specialist pain physioth erapist, junior doctor and specialist nurse funded by industry but managing demand remains a challenge an requires additional capacity which is managed through of Waiting List Initiatives (WLI's). 17 We have strengthened the patient outcome collection for the service, with the introduction of the use of Spine Tango for certain pain procedures. Outcome collection remains a priority area for the service and we continue to work to expand, strengthen and consolidate processes for collection and integrate digital solutions to increase outcome collection and reduce burden on patients and the reliance on clinical staff time. The pain service have introduced the Expedited Root Block Service which will streamline the pathway for this procedure, for suitable patients, re ducing waiting times and improving their quality of life. The service avoids a outpatients consultation with a Pain consultant when specific clinical criteria are met. A joint MDT clinic with a Consultant Urologist and Consultant in Pain Medicine has comm enced focusing on male patients with pelvic pain. There is an ambition to expand this MDT clinic further with a psychologist and physiotherapist. The 34th Liverpool Annual Pain course on the Management of Chronic Pain was held in July 2018, supported by The Pain Relief Foundation. This is an advanced practical and interactive course in clinical pain management for multi -disciplinary pain p rofessionals and t rainees , who are aiming to develop their skills in assessing and treating complex chronic pain patients. The course offered the opportunity to develop an evidence -based approach to assessment, examination and formulation of diagnosis, and how to design a comprehensive management plan. The course attended by national and international delegates was again oversubscribed and delegate feedback continued to be excellent. The pain team were awarded the Innovation Honour Award by Nevro which was awarded f or the ir commitment to HF1 0 therapy development & advancement with the latest Senza ll IPG . Pain Management Programme (PMP) We have added to our PMP repertoire in 2018/19 with the launch of a Community programme. Our Community Pain Management Programme (CPMP) 12-month pilot was launched at the beginning of the year, located in the Warrington area for Warrington CCG patients . The CPMP service began accepting referrals in February 2018, with the first Programme held in April 2018. The service provided 10 programmes between April 2018 and March 2019, treating p atients with chronic pain , bringing care closer to home through an out of hospital mode l. This is a direct result of work which was initiated by The Walton Centre , as one of the selected 'Vanguards' for the New Care Models Programme . The CPMP is an essential element of NHS England's National Back and Radicular Pain Pathway, designed to ensur e patients get access to the treatment they need , when they need it. Through the work of the regional Health and Care Partnership for Cheshire and Merseyside and specifically the Neuroscience Programme, we continue to build on the successes of the Neuro Ne twork Vanguard and the ambition is to increase CPMP local provision to serve the population of Cheshire and Merseyside. 18 We also continued to provide our full range of specialist for PMPs for people experiencing chronic pain including : Intensive 16 day Pain Management Programme with outpatient and residential options 5 day Pain Management Programme Chronic Pelvic Pain Management Programme Young Adult Pain Management Programme (approx. 18 -25 years) Facial Pain Management Programme Individualised Pain Manageme nt Programme for more complex needs that cannot be met in a group based PMP setting Referrals into these specialist PMP's , delivered at the Walton 'hub' site , have continued to see growth in the number of referrals . A 7% increase has been observed across the programmes, compared with 17/18. The number of medical conversion clinics ha s been increased to help assess patients as timely as possible but the year has been a very challenging one in terms of RTT achievement within the sub -speciality. The Neuros cience Laboratories Demand continued to grow in year with growth observed across all areas; Clinical Neuropathology / CSF Cytology , Clinical Neuroimmunology and Clinical Neurobiochemistry. To support the increasing demands on the Neuroimmunology and Neuro biochemistry laboratory we have replaced our Medical Laboratory Assistant positions with Associate Healthcare P ractitioners, which has increased development of our staff and means they are able to assist laboratory staff with routine work and point of care responsibilities. The department welcomed a new Consultant Neuropathologist to t he team in July 2018 . All clinical services were maintained during the recruitment process for both Cons ultant replacements with robust Service Level Agreements (SLA's) in place with other providers and the strong teamwork of all of the Neurosciences Laboratories staff . Following United Kingdom Accreditation Service (UKAS) accreditation in 2015; t he Neuroscience Laboratories had their third annual surveillance visit by UKAS in November 2018 and successfully maintained accreditation. During this process, further specialist neuro diagnostic work was added to the accreditation scope of the services provided, evidence submitted and assessed, which resulted in full accreditation across the new scope. Sample collection and storage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood continues in our BioBank repository, launched in 2017. Samples and relevant clinical information is collected and stored for use in current and future neurological research projects. It allows our clinicians active in research, and also other researchers nationally and internationally, increased access to samples when conducting important research into neurological diseases, including Dementia and Parkinson's, and th e treatments of those diseases. Patients undergoing routine tests are asked to donate , with samples taken at the same time as their test, making the 19 donation quick and easy for consenting patients. The Walton Research Tissue Bank is currently supporting 20 research projects. Following the retirement of Clinical Scientist, Dr Geoff Kier in Spring 2018, the department is now supported by Dr Huda and Dr Jacob , Consultant Neurologists , who attend departmental MDTs and work with the laboratory in the developme nt of neuroimmunological assays; supporting translational medicine. Over the past year , our Consultant Neuropathologists have been working with the Neuropathology laboratory to introduce new antibodies to aid with diagnosis . This has led to the laboratories being fully compliant with NICE guidelines. The laboratories have also successfully recruited to a Biomedical scientist to lead on IT within the department. This is a new post which will be critical as we embark on our plans to introduce Order Comms, aswe ll as address ing pathology IT issues . We have successfully replaced both the Trusts blood gas analysers based in critical care and the theatre department , with minimal clinical service disruption . The auto -immunostainer in Neuropathology , an important piece of equipment involved in the staining of tissue was also replaced and the gamma counter ; required for radio immunoassay in Neur oimmunology . Approval has been granted for the recruitment of a Professor of Pathology with clinical sessions in the Neuros cience Laboratories. This new joint position between t he University of Liverpool and T he Walton Centre , will also link with the newly created Liverpool Head and Neck Institute . The successful candidate will be expected to develop and expand the neuropathol ogy research platform, linking in with clinical and academic colleagues to build a first class, world leading department. They will also be work alongside our two C onsultant Neuropathologists to develop and expand the clinical work of the department. The department implemented the National Pathology Exchange (NPEx) software in March 2019, which provides digital integration of UK laboratories enabling pathology test requests and results to be sent from any lab to any lab in a matter of seconds. Prior to thi s technology, our method of receiving referred work and outsourcing was dependent on a paper based system. This development will result in reduced turnaround times, reduced risk of transcription errors, income generation potential and added visibility of tests by Provider showing price and performance data enabling informed decision making in order to get the best quality and most efficient service for patients. Division of Neurology The Neurology Division continues to deliver a responsive specialist servic e to patients; both in the Centre and at partner Trusts and community settings via an outreach service. This model of care was recently chosen as a preferred model by the Association of British Neurologists (ABN) following the work undertaken by the Trust as part of the NHS Acute Care C ollaboration Vanguard. 20 The Neurology s ervice provides a specialist service to patients across Cheshire, Merseyside, North Wales and the Isle of Man. Our network of satellite clinics operates from 15 acute hospitals, providing both outpatient services and support to inpatients. It is a large and busy neurology service which, in 2018/19 , saw 29,426 new outpatients and treated 4 ,880 inpatient s in either the Walton Centre's day case or ward facilities. The Neurology Service is delivered by a multi -skilled professional team. There are 41 Consultants and 25 specialist nurses, who work alongside an experienced therapy team to provide the holistic and multidisciplinary care required for our patients. Sub -speciality clinics are also provided in epilepsy, movement disorders, headache, neuromuscular, multiple sclerosis, motor neurone disease, vascular and neuromyelitis optica. There continues to be an increase in demand for our service year on year. As such robust plans are required for both the Consultant and nursing workforce. Four further consultants have been appointed in 2018/19, working in the areas of movement disorders, multiple sclerosis and Neuromyelitis optica (NMO ). There is also an intention to review the disease specific nurse specialist workforce for all neurology sub - specialties to ensure an appropriate workforce is in place to meet the needs of our patients . The Service continues to sup port the neurology service at Robert Jones and Agnes Hunt Orthopaedic Hospital NHS Foundation Trust since entering into a sub -contract with them in 2017/8. Work is also underway exploring how we can support the adult neurology service in Shrewsbury and Tel ford and thus enable the service to re -open to new referrals from mid -2019/20. Following the NHS Acute Care C ollaboration Vanguard programme, work is continuing on the development and implementation of the acute headache pathway , alongside the national dev elopment of best practice guidelines for headache. In the field of epilepsy , we are supporting the implementation of the NASH 3 (National Audit of Seizures in Hospitals) recommendations which link to the post seizure pathway. This work is also being suppor ted locally by the I ntegrated Neurology Nurse Specialist team who visit local Accident and Emergency departments to ensure neurology patients are on the correct treatment pla n. The development of a pathway excellence framework for Parkinson's disease has a lso commenced. The Vanguard programme has enhanced the neurology work undertaken at the Walton Centre and has raised the profile of our services nationally. There are frequent requests to share our learning at national events and also requests to support t he development of other neurology services across the country . The Cochrane Epilepsy Group continues to be based in Liverpool which maintains a high national and international profile , with awards of NIHR grants and close collaboration with the European Br ain Council. There also continues to be major interest in the service delivery of epilepsy, the genetics of epilepsy, MRI scanning and the drug treatment of epilepsy including issues associated with prescribing valproate in pregnancy. 21 The expansion of the mechanical thrombectomy service for stroke patients across Cheshire and Merseyside continues, with detailed plans for expansion in place. It remains an ambition of NHS England to see this treatment available 24/7 over the next five to ten years and work is underway at the Walton Centre to realise this for our population. The Neurology Service is also seeking to further develop its contribution to the urgent care pathway by implementing an ambulatory care service across our larger acute sites. Ambulatory ca re provides a high - quality patient focussed care pathway that delivers rapid senior assessment whilst avoiding the need for an inpatient stay. In 2018/19 a successful pilot commenced at the Royal Liverpool Hospital and work is now underway to expand this s ervice to other acute hospitals. Therapy Services The Speech and language therapy team took possession of a brand new Functional Endocscopic Evaluation ( FEES ) Kit in November 2018 following capital investment and patients are now benefiting from more accurate objective swallow assessment which reduces reliance upon tube feeds, supports earlier tracheostomy weening and reduces risk of silent aspiration. The rec ently extended Therapy outpatient service has been busy embedding a number of new multidisciplinary clinics and patient pathways which focus on condition management and health and wellbeing and includes movement disorders such as Parkinson's Disease, Motor Neurone Disease and Dystonia with our first prescribing Injection Physiotherapist for Botulin Toxin. The team also works closely with the Rehab Network Vocational Rehab Officer (VRO) developing valuable links between Therapy employment clinic, VRO and pat ient employers. Collectively this supports the Trust position as a Centre of Excellence in improving access to multi -disciplinary teams and reflects the emerging national strategy to deliver a long term NHS Plan (2019). Aligned to this and building on the Vanguard Programme, the Therapy service continues to work in partnership to develop a project to improve access to exercise and activity for people with neurological disorders. Following on from the groundwork of 2017/18, the service is actively invol ved in rolling out the project model and will support further engagement events during 2019 for service users and providers and health care professional in a quest to make health and leisure facilities inclusive and accessible for people living with a l ong term Neurological condition. Research and Innovation is a clear priority within the Walton Centre strategy and the Therapy Service have matched this with objectives directed at raising the profile of R D & I by encouraging staff involvement and ensuri ng support is easily accessible. The service has its own R D & I committee and achievements to date include; three ideas Forums in 2018, research competencies, research surgeries, mentorship, electronic resources and a dynamic list of funding sources for each discipline. 22 A culture of enquiry and research activity is encouraged and celebrated. The monthly team brief /staff meeting now includes a 'Focus On' slot in which staff showcase audits, research, ideas and projects to share good work which also helps reduce research based fear. Several members of the therapy team are currently undertaking post -graduate research degrees including Masters in Research and a Dietitian will complete her PhD in June 2019 . Staff have presented their work at national and inte rnational level where they received outstanding recognition and others are involved in AHP research networks. Future aspirations for the service include developing a research fellowship post, Incorporating RD & I into all supervision and appraisal discussi ons, develop ing research and quality improvement projects arising from the Ideas forum, increas ing AHP publications in recognised journals and seek ing out opportunities for collaboration with the C linical Trials Units nursing and medical teams to develop p rospects for therapists to become more involved in clinical trials. The Therapy service plans to deliver additional external training courses during 2019 to promote best practice in neuroscience which should attract income to support the cost of training a nd education invested in Therapy staff. Such courses increase the profile of the service, improve collaborative links with other professionals and organisations and allow wider dissemination of expert knowledge. A range of Therapy staff were successfully nominated for employee awards during 2018 and an Occupational Therapist was awarded CEO Employee of the year. Complex Rehabilitation The Walton Centre is both the host and hub of the Cheshire and Merseyside Reha bilitation Network formed in January 2013 to integrate complex rehabilitation services from hyper acute to community in the region. The Rehabilitation Network is a unique collaboration of six partner organisations; The Walton Centre The Royal Liverpool an d Broadgreen Hospital St Helens and Knowsely Teaching Hospital Wirral University Teaching Hospital Oak Vale Gardens Priory Group Community Rehabilitation Team The Walton Centre has two rehabilitation units, hyper acute (level 1a) and level 1b and there are four spoke units across the region who all provide inpatient beds for level 2 rehabilitation. There is one unit, Oak Vale Gardens, for level 3 rehabilitation with two locality teams provid ing specialist rehabilitation community services. The aim of the Network is to work in partnership across six providers to deliver a high quality, fully co - ordinated and seamless pathway of care, of supported, active and extended rehabilitation with a multidisciplinary team of medical, therapy and nursing staff. The team is supported by other specialists in 23 key areas such as rehabilitation co -ordination, clinical and neuropsychology, neuro psychiatry, vocational rehabilitation therapy, social support and clerical / administrative / managerial st aff. Patients accessing the Network do so based on need not diagnosis following traumatic injury or illness. The work on patient flow has continued throughout 2018/19 and whilst we continue to see some significant delays this is usually due to availability of external placements rather than processes or funding issues. Peer review s were undertaken from April to June 2018. The panel consisted of representatives from all partners, trauma and critical care networks. Overall there were no serious concerns and it was agree d that the general standard of r ehabilitation delivered was excellent. The enthusiasm, motivation and engagement of all staff groups was also noted. Areas for development were identified and these have been worked on by the teams. The Masters level Complex Rehabilitation Module has delivered two cohorts this year, the first in March 2018 to a group of staff from Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board and the second in September 2018 to a mix of Network staff and external students. The three cohorts delivered have gained positive feedback from the students and already there are 11 places booke d for the next cohort in Septem ber 2019. Life Link Clinics were developed in the Rehab Network Phoenix Unit at Broadgreen and have been rolled out to the other units across the Network. It was recognised that valuable therapy time was being used to address concerns in relation to housing, benefits and other social issues. The Rehab Co -ordinator, Social Worker and a representative from the Brain Charity hold a monthly clinic where any of these issues can be discussed and so freeing the therapy time to concentrate on rehab . The Network is working closely with NHS England and Wirral and West Cheshire Commissioners to review the services provided at Clatterbridge Rehabilitation Centre and to try and address the gaps and ensure equity of services for the patients living in Cheshire and Wirral . In March 2019 the Network h eld a Showcase Event to celebrate the first 5 years of the Network. There was a full programme that included a number of talks, a \"marketplace\" to demonstrate the pathway from hyperacute to community and some of the unique points of the network, interactive sessions and patients who have been through the Network w ere there to share the ir stories. Neuropsychology During 2018/19 the Neuropsychology department has seen some changes and developments. One of the most exciting developments this year is the successful business case for an inpatient Neuropsychology service. We are recruiting t o the posts and excited to make a start on this new development. We have a new psychological therapist for the assessment and treatment service for people diagnosed with a functional neurological disorder. A further exciting development for this patient gr oup is the research trial we are part of which involves physiotherapy intervention for patients with functional limb weakness. If the trial outcomes are successful, this would provide a basis for a future development (requiring a business 24 case) within the service for treatment of these patients. In addition we are developing resources to trial a psychoeducation group that patients would attend (approximately 6 -10 patients at a time for 2 to 3 sessions only) before they go into therapy. This would ensure t hat the therapy sessions are utilised fully for intervention as the group sessions would focus on clarifying any questions the patients may have about their diagnosis and what engaging in psychological therapy will involve amongst other things. The Neur opsychology team continue to support other services and staff groups. Throughout the year we have been part of MDT clinics for patients with Neuromyelitis Optica, and the cognitive function clinic for patients with a suspected diagnosis of dementia. We al so ran a trial of a joint neuropsychology and physiotherapy clinic for patients with M ultiple Sclerosis . One of our staff provides 1:1 therapy for patients with Motor Neurone Disease. More recently, we've been asked to provide debriefing (and/or debriefing training) for staff who experience traumatic events at work. In addition, the department continues to support the \"R oad to Recovery\" event for patients who have had a subarachnoid haemorrhage. We have recently received funding to purchase iPads to start using a new cognitive testing system called Q-interactive (from the Pearson testi ng company). This is a development which will go live from the new financial year. A trial earlier in the year provided proof of concept and patients of all ages fou nd the system easy to use and they even said they enjoyed it. On the research front, the ROAM study continues to recruit and we are working on a Cochrane Review of the treatments for Functional Dissociative attacks (aka NEAD). The Neuropsychology team are committed to supporting training for Psychology and Neuropsychology within the region and beyond. The team has strong links with Liverpool, Manchester, Lancashire and Bristol Universities and provides both placements for trainees and also specialist lect ures on their courses. Neuroradiology 2018/19 saw the procurement of a 1.5T wide bore MRI scanner, as a replacement for the 0.35T open MR scanner. This scanner can scan faster than the open MR and has increased capacity for MRI. 2018/19 also saw the proc urement of a Digital Mobile x -ray machine for use in CRU . The Department successfully recruited and welcomed a new Consultant Neuroradiologist into the workforce towards the end of year, as a replacement for a retiring Consultant . Neuroradiology continues to be an active member of the Cheshire and Merseyside Radiology Five Year Forward View Programme, and has led as an Early Adopter site for the Stroke Pathway. The development of the mechanical thrombectomy service for stroke patie nts across Cheshire and Merseyside continues, with detailed plans for expansion in place. Mechanical thrombectomy is a momentous development in the treatment of stroke, demonstrating significantly improved outcomes and reduced disability for many stroke su rvivors. It remains an ambition of NHS England to see t his treatment 25 available 24/7 in the future , in collaboration with local partners, work is underway at the Walton Centre to realise this for our population. Neurophysiology Demand into the Neurophysiology department remains high. Due to Consultant Neurophysiologist vacancies the service has continued to consider different ways of working to meet EMG demand. As a result, two new advanced practitioner posts for Clinical Physiologists have been created, currently they are training with the Consultant Neurophysiologists to undertake and report their own nerve conduction studies for carpal tunnel syndrome. Quality assurance of this development will be monitored via supervision and audit. In addition, there are plans to build on this success and create further advanced Clinical Physiologist roles in 2019/20. Following a national change to the undergraduate training programme for Clinical Physiologists, Neurophysiology welcomed its first-degree apprentice to the team in September 2018. Historically trainees were based full time at University, attending department on placement for work based training and assessment. This exciting opportunity enables the apprentice to be employed on a three ye ar fix ed term contract, attending university on a weekly basis whilst developing their clinical skills and contributing more consistently to the team and ultimately patient care. One of the key applications of the robotic arm, in neuro -surgery, has been the introduction of stereo EEG telemetry monitoring, which supports t he epilepsy surgery programme. The patients being considered for epilepsy surgery, whose epilepsy cannot be controlled by medication will benefit from stereo EEG monitoring. The technolog y uses specific trajectory planning, allowing accessibility to deeper structures. Patients have better clinical outcomes, less infection risk (in comparison to other techniques) and reduced post-operative stay. Patients whom previously may not have been selected for surgery may now be considered suitable. Pharmacy Pharmacy services are provided via a service level agreement with Aintree University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, and the service continues to develop year on year. The pharmacist prescribing service is now well established, with pharmacists playing a ke y role in the same day admission process for elective surgical patients. Two pharmacists review all same day admission patients admitted Monday to Friday morning for surgery and prescribe their usual medicines, ensuring any necessary changes peri -operative ly are actioned. An audit of prescribing errors across the Trust demonstrated that pharmacist independent prescribers (PIP) write a significant number of prescriptions, both for inpatients and at discharge. Service evaluation after implementation of the p harmacist prescribing service highlighted that PIPs wrote 54.5% of discharge prescriptions, relieving workload from medical colleagues. Furthermore, an audit of prescribing practice across the Trust has demonstrated that PIPs made significantly fewer error s than junior medical staff (0.2% 26 versus 13.4% respectively), improving patient safety and accuracy of prescribing of medications on tr ansfer between care settings. The wider role of pharmacists within The Walton Centre has further expanded this year, wi th senior pharmacist representation newly requested at various Trust groups, committees and initiatives. Further expansion of the pharmacy team is planned f or the coming year, with Trust B oard approval for a new antimicrobial pharmacist post. Estates and F acilities The Trust has undertaken a replacement of heating pipework in Chavasse Ward, Theatre 6 and the surrounding corridors . We will shortly be implementing phase 2. In 2018 , Facilities introduced an electronic portering system which now gives all wards and departments the ability to pre book portering tasks, general tasks and monitor progress of a specific task. The Porters now receive tasks directly to their radios in the form of a text style message. The Trust, again, rated highly in the annual Patient Led Assessments , across the six main domains of : privacy and dignity food cleanliness general building maintenance how well the needs of patients with dementia are met how well the needs of patients with a disability are met The Trust had an average of 96.23% across all domains, which made it the third highest performing specialist Trust in the coun try and gave us a ranking of 15 out of 279 NHS Trusts across England. Our results were over 7% higher than the national avera ge. Going concern disclosure Following extensive enquiries, the D irectors have a reasonable expectation that the NHS Foundation Trust has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. They have identified no material uncertainties that cast doubt on the Trust's ability to continue a s a going concern. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts . Hayley Citrine , Chief Executive 24 May 2019 27 2ii Performance Report - performance analysis The purpose of the performance report is to highlight the most important performance measures for the trust. The most significant performance areas are: quality and patient safety, finance and activity including referral to treatment targets. These are considered in detail below. Financial Summary f or the Year Ended 31 March 2019 The Trust delivered a \u00a35,769 k surplus for the financial year ending 31 March 2019. This position includes non-recurrent Provider Sustainability Funding (PSF) of \u00a34,697 k, which consists of \u00a32,263k funding for meeting agreed financial ta rgets during the year and \u00a32,434 k 'bonus and incentive' funding for achievement and over performance of the planned year -end position. The position also includes a charitable donation of \u00a358k. The Trust has faced significant challenges with reg ard to patient acuity which has required one to one therapeutic specialing care (one nurse or one healthcare assistant to one patient and sometimes several to one in some instances). The creation of an internal nurse bank system during 2018/19 led to a re duction in nurse agency and overtime expenditure during the year resulting in agency expenditure being below NHSI cap, although pressure on this area of spend continues. The identification and delivery of recurrent efficiency savings has also proved a challenge for the organisation during 2018/19. Table 1 sets out the reconciliation of the annual accounts to the Trust's Normalised Trading Surplus for the year ended 31 March 2019. Table 1 \u00a3'000 Surplus for the year per statement of comprehensive income 5,769 Normalisation adjustment: Capital donation from the Charitable Fund (58) Normalised Trading Surplus (including STF) 5,711 Normalisation The NHS Improvement Compliance Framework measures Trusts ' performance on the underlying or normalised trading position of the Trust after allowing for the adjustment of exceptional items that are one off in nature and not related to the core routine business of the Trust. Revaluation of Trust Property During 2018/19 following a review of the Trust's assets, including a revaluation of land and buildings, by an independent valuer, a \u00a31,177k total impairment was identified. The revaluation is a technical accounting 28 adjustment which has no impact on the Tru st's cash position (as it is a non -cash item) or its overall reported performance to NHS Improvement (as the adjustment is normalised) in the financial statements. Income The Trust has seen income (turnover) increase of \u00a31.9 million from the previous year (year ending 31 March 2019) which represents a 1.45 % increase. The Trust receives the largest element of its income from NHS England for the provision of Specialised Prescribed Services. The Trust received \u00a395.7 million from NHS England/ CCGs in the year ending 31 March 2019, an increase of \u00a30.7 million (0.7%) on the previous financial year . This reflects a change to national specialised tariffs, increased acuity of patients treated by the organisation as well as additional agreed contract activity underta ken by the Trust on behalf of NHS England/ CCGs. In addition, the Trust receives \u00a317.4 million of income from Welsh Health Specialised Services Committee (WHSSC) for provision of services to the population of (mainly) North Wales, both through outreach c linics held within hospitals within Wales and for Welsh patients attending The Walton Centre, either as an out - patient or in -patient. This reflects a 2.3% increase from the previous year, which is in the main due to the new HRG4+ tariff as well as patient complexity and acuity. The Trust also receives other amounts of income from different sources and these are set out in the following pie chart: 29 Expenditure In line with the growth in income (turnover), the Trust has seen an increase in Operating Expenses of \u00a32.3 million (1.91 %) compared to the previous year. The following pie chart sets out the main components of expenditure incurred by the Trust in 2018/19. The biggest single item of expenditure incurred by the Trust relates to employment of staff to deliver the range of services provided by the Trust. The Trust spent \u00a369.9 million on staffing during 2018/19 which was an increase of \u00a33.5 million (5.3%) on the previous year. Much of this was due to the national Agenda for Change pay award that was paid to staff during 2018 -19. Increased pay costs were also as a result of investments in medical staffing and increased waiting list initiative costs (incurred to ensure delivery of services). However, as noted above, some of the increased costs also related to patient acuity and the necessi ty of delivering more therapeutic spec ialing. The increase was partly offset by a reduction in non pay due to the move of excl uded implants and devices to a national zero cost model. The average number of whole time equivalent (WTE) staff has increased by 40 from the previous year (of which 4 are permanent and 36 are temporary) . The majority of the increase is due to the volume of temporary bank nursing staff used by the Trust.

The Trust delivered several departmental restructures in 2018/19 in order to facilitate efficiency and productivity improvements. These, in part, were facilitated by a time limited Mutually Agreed Resignation Scheme (MAR S). The scheme was approved by NHS Imp rovement and adhered to national Agenda for Change terms and conditions of service. Tables 4, 5 and 6 show the number and value of exit packages for 2018/19 and 2017/18 .

Within the financial plan s et at the start of the financial year was the requirement to deliver \u00a33.2 million of efficiency savings to ensure the overall delivery of the control total (financial 'target' set by NHS Improvement, delivery of which secures access to Provider Sustainabil ity Funding). As at 31 March 2019 the Trust had achieved \u00a31.1m of recurrent savings, which represents 34% of the planned level. This represents 0.90% of the Trusts operating expenses. \u00a32 .2m of recurrent savings were not delivered during 2018/19 but additio nal savings were found through a number of non-recurrent measures. All identified savings schemes are subject to Quality Impact Assessments (QIA) and approved by the Medical Director and Director of Nursing to ensure that there is no adverse impact on patient safety, quality and patient experience. The Trust changed its approach to cost improvement during the year and transitioned to a quality improvement approach to savings. Looking forward to 201 9/20, the trust is instigating 3 major Trust wide transforma tion programmes which i t anticipates will deliver the required efficiency savings for the financial year. Investments in Trust Infrastructure and Equipment The Trust spent \u00a35.0m of capital expenditure in 2018/19. Expenditure during the year included replacement of heating pipes across the Trust as well expenditure on an equipment replacement programme and the progression of the Trust's Digital Strategy. The capital programme is guided by principles of patient safety, business continuity/ service delivery and clinical developments in line with the Trust's strategy. Table 7 sets out the major components of the Trust's capital investment expenditure programme for the year ended 31st March 2019.

They have identified no material uncertainties that cast significant doubt on the Trust's ability to continue as a going concern. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts. The main factors in reaching this conclusion are: As per national guidance, the Trust has submitted an annual plan for 2019/20 with a forecast surplus position and is working on a five -year plan for the Trust in conjunction with the Cheshire and Merseyside area; The Trust has a signed contract with CCG's for 2019/20 activity plan and an agreed 2019/20 contract value with NHS England; Projected ca sh balances are sufficient to sustain the capital investment programme and meet short term operating costs. The Trust has sufficient cash headroom to support its plans; The Trust has sufficient cash reserves to be able to operate for over 60 days if all in come flows were to immediately cease There is no expectation for short term loans or overdraft facilities; If the Trusts efficiency target is delivered and there are no material changes to national tariff (which are currently not anticipated) then it is an ticipated that the Trust will continue to deliver a surplus moving into 2020/21. This would be the case even if central Provider Sustainability Funding is not received in 2020/21; Auditors' opinions have provided assurance as to the accuracy and reliabilit y of the Trust's financial systems and the robustness of the internal controls. Forward Look The financial year 2019/20 will be another challenging year for the NHS as a whole. Plans are in place to ensure that the Trust will continue to deliver against its terms of licence as a Foundation Trust by delivering excellent, safe, high quality patient care. The control total proposed by NHS Improvement is a \u00a34.8m Capital - 1,445 IM&T 1,712 Neurosurgery 911 Corporate 42 Total Capital 4,973 34 surplus and the Trust has set plans to achieve this. This predicted performance is driven by the c ontinued increase in historic referral trends but delivered in an efficient and effective manner. The plan includes a cost improvement programme of \u00a32.9 mill ion, with year -end cash balances projected to be c.\u00a325 million. Risks and Uncertainties There cont inues to be a good deal of uncertainty within the NHS and the Trust is managing several risks and issues. These can be broadly categorised int o the following 4 main headings: Productivity: ensuring the performance levels necessary to meet patient demand and continue to deliver acc ess targets and financial plans; Workforce: recruitment , retention and succession planning of the right workforce at the right time to deliver the increase in activity as well as the increasing complexity of patients. Healthcare acquired infections: continued control of infections and manageme nt of newly emerging infections; Commissioner decisions: the funding available to commissioners and how/where commissioning decisions are taken: o In 2017/18 a block contract was agreed with North Mersey CCG's as part of an 'Acting as One' arrangement across the North Merseyside region for a period of 2 years. This arrangement has been agreed to be continued into 2019/20 for a period of 1 year with 3 of the 4 CCG's. This means that non -special ist activity levels are fixed (with the block being based on 2018/19 actual outturn plus 3%). Any performance above this level will not be funded and as such creates some risk if referrals exceed agreed growth levels; o Changes to the tariff were introduced in 2017/18 which recognised the increased cost of providing specialist services (HRG4+). Further tariff changes introduced for 2019/20 recognise this further. The increased tariffs to d ate have not been paid on a recurrent basis by Welsh Commissioners sinc e 2017/18. This risk continues, however there is now national engagement between Department of Health and Social Care, NHS Improvement, NHS England, Welsh Commissioners and Welsh Government to come to a satisfactory conclusion with regard to funding this a ctivity. Principal Risks The principal risks facing the Trust are: Failure to achieve the recurrent QIP financial plans in accordance with the Strategic Plan due to conflicting pressures/challenges without adequate mitigations Failure of Welsh Health Specialist Services Committee (WHSSC ) to pay tariffs at HRG4+ levels. Failure to meet Neurosurgery and Pain RTT targets required by NHS Improvement and NHS England 35 Compromising patient safety due to failure to prevent and breaching annual NHS Improvement t hreshold for C -Difficile Failure of Low Carbon Steel heating pipework due to premature corrosion Failure to deliver the Trust Digital Strategy and business / digital Intelligence given the level of work required within the current resources and loss of exp erienced members of staff Risk of breaching the NHSI Agency Cap because of increase in Medical Locum usage and HCA Agency usage for specialing which may contribute to worsening of Trusts overall financial risk rating. Risk of increased waiting times and op erational performance including over perform ance in NHSE contract given the Trust has taken additional spinal activity from another local acute hospital. Lack of assurance on quality of data provided by the Informatics Department and, at times, difficulty in meeting deadlines. A risk of not having the required staffing resource to deliver the services the Trust is commissioned to provide Potential impact on business continuity due to an ageing estate Risk of physical harm to staff due to the complex clini cal nature of the patient population The above risks have been assessed and have been rated between 9 and 16. Risks rated below 16 are reported in the annual governance statement. All these risks are recorded on the Board Assurance Framework. Following a reduction in 2017/18 the Trust has experienced a significant increase in violent and aggressive incidents from patients against staff in 2018/19 . These incidents were dealt with on an individual basis with staff and patient safety being managed as a priority. Staff were supported throughout these even ts. In April 2018 the Trust invested in, and successfully appointed, an internal personal safety trainer. The trainer has developed a new training course which is nationally accredited. This now includ es practical scenario based training which has been developed in conjunction with the Moving and Handling Advisor and ensures staff have all the relevant competencies in dealing with challenging patients in real -time. The trainer also attends wards and dep artments following incidents of aggression, to provide advice and assist in the development of strategies to best manage these patients , ensuring that all actions, including the use of sanctions, are used when required. 2018/19: Activity During 2018/19, the Trust's activity has increased by 3. 6% in comparison to 2017/18 (including diagnostic tests).

Table 10 represents an overview of Trust performance against national priorities the single oversight framework published by NHS Improvement. It was highlighted in November 2018 by NHSI that a number of providers including The Walton Centre were not including Appointment Slot Issues (ASI - this is where an appointment is not available to booked via choose and book at the time of the request) as part of their Referral to Treatment (RTT) Data. NHSI highlighted that patients were incorrectly being left on an ASI list until they had an appointment booked rather than being manually added to the Patient Tracking List ( PTL) and included in the reported waiting list numbers each month. NHSI advised that each trust would have a chance to resubmit the national data for the period of September 2017 to August 2018 in the next resubmission window. The Walton Centre submitted the revised figures for this period in March 2019 and from January 2019 ASIs have been included in all submissions. Once the next resubmission window opens to include from September 2018 the Trust will update the September to December 2018 data to ensure National and internal RTT reporting data is accurate. It should be noted that due to this resubmission internal figures may not reflect the national reporting position until the figures have been refreshed. Table 10 reflects the performance against the indicator.

The Trust is currently working towards a sustainable development plan but the following options are considered for minimising negative environmental and social impacts and maximising positive impacts: Ensuring compliance with environmental legislation; Ensuring procurement supports the specific environmental and social objectives and targets of programmes and projects such as energy efficiency of new buildings and equipment; Choosing suppliers from our local community first, where possible; Ensuring that service providers have the capability to meet the technical environmental aspects of projects. The Trust has continually undertaken and monitored a number of measures during the year to reduce its impact on the environment.

Education and Organisational Development Supporting the Trust's strategic plan the organisation continues to be highly committed to promote excellence in education and training to ensure it delivers the highest calibre of health care staff for future NHS patients. The role of the Education team is to support the organisation to provide education, training and development opportunities to develop current workforce and to support the talent of the future. The Trust was reaccredited with IIP Gold status in 2017 and the standard was maintained during an interim review in 2018 where the Trust's commitment to developing its staff continued to be recognised. Education and organisational development initiatives from the last 12 months include: Cohorts 13 & 14 completed the PRIDE leadership programme, which forms part of the Trust colle ctive leadership portfolio. The programme, which has been revised based on user feedback and organisational requirements, includes resilience, mindfulness, handling conflict, developing effective relationships, coaching skills and performance & motivation . Feedback for the programme remains excellent and Cohorts 15 & 16 commenced the programme in January 2019. An internal group of coach practitioners from a range of disciplines across the Trust gained accreditation in 2017 and the coaching provision was of ficially launched to the organisation in March 2018. The group maintain their accreditation via regular CPD and external supervision sessions and continue to support staff across the organisation. To further support the Trust's coaching strategy and as p art of the journey to embed a coaching culture within the organisation, a two -day \"Coaching Conversations\" is included in the PRIDE co llective leadership programme. Staff have also been able to access external coaching when appropriate to support them wit h specific development. As detailed in the coaching action plan presented to Business Performance Committee in February 2018, the coaching group are making connections with neighbouring Trusts within the region to explore the possibility of a reciprocal c oaching arrangement to reduce reliance on external coaching. Access to leadership development programmes and various other opportunities provided by the North West Leadership Academy continue t o be available to all staff. Leadership development programmes accessed by staff include Elizabeth Garrett Anderson and Nye Bevan. 55 The Rehabilitation Network, supported by education leads within The Walton Centre, designed a standalone 30 credits masters module in conjunction with Liverpool John Moores Univ ersity. Complex Rehab in a Multidisciplinary Context accepted its first cohort in September 2017, with the 3 cohorts now completed . Attendees on the module come from across and also outside of the region, with attendees on the 2nd cohort travelling from Wales. Attendees who have completed the module come from a range of professions, including medical staff, psychiatry, AHP's and psychology. The module is designed by clinicians and delivered by clinicians who work for the Rehab Network and is generating interest nationally, with enquires from the London Rehab Network regarding how their members could access the course. Organisational development support continues to be available to the Trust, including team away days, team development and objective and pr iority setting. The Walton Centre continues to provide quality undergraduate medical student placements for 3rd and 5th year students, in partnership with Liverpool School of Medicine. Every 3rd year student attends the highly evaluated Neurology placement at the Trust and the innovative implementation of the formative assessment at the end of each student's placement has been acknowledged as good practice by Liverpool University and adopted by o ther Trusts within the region. The recommendations provided by Health Education North West following the Quality Monitoring visit in January 2017 continue to be embedded and anecdotal feedback from trainees supports the general positive theme of the repo rt regarding the experience of the junior doctors' whilst training at The Walton Centre . A formal update of progress was submitted to HEE in May 2018 . The revised appraisal paperwork, process, policy and training was launched in January 2019, following an extensive consultation with staff. The main focus of the revised paperwork is \"Having a Conversation\" and the training and support guidance has been completely refreshed to encourage this approach. Initial feedback on the new appraisal process is positive and a more in -depth review will be conducted 6 months following rollout. Following the deep dive review of mandatory training, all changes have been implemented to ensure statutory/mandatory training requirements are supported and the Trust conti nues to deliver safe and effective care to its patients. The Trusts has engaged with regional streamlining recommendations and additional topics have been made available via e-learning to further improve compliance and reduce repetition of learning when jo ining from another Trust. The Trust has maintained good attendance for statutory and mandatory training with a revised training needs analysis agreed, supported by a new and revised reporting framework to help support delivery of safe and effective care t o our patients. The Trust continues to support all staff with a range of education and development opportunities available to support service priorities and individual development. This includes professional qualifications, conferences and seminars, post registration accredited opportunities, apprenticeships, skills development and clinical skills training - including catheterisation, cannulation and venepuncture. 56 Following the introduction of the apprenticeship levy in 2017, the Trust has incorporated app renticeship requirements into the annual training needs analysis collection to und erstand organisational demand. In 2018/19 the Trust had 9 apprenticeship starts: o 4 x Trainee Nurse Associates o 1 Neurophysiology apprenticeship o 1 Finance apprenticeship o 3 x Service Improvement apprenticeships As part of a commitment to corporate and social responsibility, the Trust provides a quality work experience programme and co -ordinates the provision of elective placements, working closely with local schools and college s. Work experience placements are highly valued and The Walton Centre supported 58 placements in 201 8/19. The Trust is working in partnership with 2 other specialist Trusts in the region and in conjunction with Merseyside Youth Association in the employm ent of NHS Employment Mentors, who are supporting organisations specifically in developing Entry Level Vocational Learning Developments for young people as well as the following groups: people with disabilities; young carers; looked after children; assess ed as not being in education, employment or training (NEETS); veterans and their families. In the 2018/19 financial year, 20 participants from the aforementioned groups have successfully completed placements at The Walton Centre . Following completion of the placements, 1 2 of the 20 have successfully found employment. Staff Survey The 201 8 survey was distributed to all Trust staff between September and November 201 8. The Staff Survey is an important annual strand in the organisation's overall approach to staff engagement. Other elements include: Established staff communications and engagement methods including a daily safety huddle, weekly email bulletin to all staff, Walton Weekly; plus a monthly team brief meeting for all heads of department which is led by the Chief Executive. Quarterly clinical senates draw together clinicians to discuss clinical issues and are well attended from all specialties. Quarterly staff listening weeks / health and wellbeing days . Participation in Staff Friends and Family Test Regular staff engagement events i.e. Berwick sessions and Schwartz rounds The Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust had 7 58 staff take part in this survey with a response rate of 53% of all staff against a national average of 53% for specialist trusts in England. This was an 11% increase on last year's response rate of 42% 57 A comparison of results year on year c an be seen in the following table: 2018/19 2017/18 2016/17 Trust Benchmark Group Trust Benchmark Group Trust Benchmark Group Equality, diversity and inclusion 9.4% 9.3% The findings for the 2018 survey are arranged under ten themes: Equality, diversity and inclusion Health & wellbeing Immediate managers Morale Quality of appraisals Quality of care Safe environment - Bullying and harassment Safe environment - violence Safety culture Staff engagement There has been no statistically significant change in any of the ten themes for the Trust this year. Out of the 10 themes: In the following 7 themes the Trust were either better or the same as the national average: Equality, diversity and inclusion - better than national average Health & wellbeing - better than national average Immediate managers - same as the national average 58 Morale - better than national average Quality of care - same as national ave rage Safe environment - Bullying and harassment - better than national average Staff engagement - same as the national average In the following 3 themes the Trust's score was worse than the national average. Quality of appraisals Safe environment - violence Safety culture Areas of improvement from the previous year are as follows: Staff recommending the organisation as a place to work Organisations actions on errors, near misses or incidents Staff said they are satisfied with the quality of care they give to patients Percentage of staff unwell as a result of work related stress Organisation acting fairly with regards to career progression/promotion regardless of ethnic background, gender, religion, sexual orientation disability or age An action plan has been developed to address issues relating to the following areas; Appraisals and support for development Violence, harassment and bullying Support/Development for Immediate Managers Whilst t he results of the staff survey are variable it is important to recognise that they are mainly positive in nature. Future Priorities and Actions The key priority areas to address inevitably need to be those identified in the areas where the Trust has scored below the national average scores. These can be explicitly profiled in existing staff engagement techniques and this will allow more prescriptive engagement exercises. However, the Trust will consider the results in their entirety and identify any areas that can be improved upon. The results can also be interpreted by staff group or department which will enable the organisation to take specific action where required. Staff Profile On 31st March 201 9 the Trust employed 1290.8 whole time equivalents made up of the following groups i n table 18 below: 59 Table 18 Staff Group Headcount FTE Add Prof Scientific and Technic 55 49.4 Additional Clinical Services 233 206.5 Administrative and Clerical 360 327.9 Allied Health Professionals 167 149.5 Estates and Ancillary 10 5.8 Healthcare Scientists 30 27.0 Medical and Dental 132 126.7 Nursing and Midwifery Registered 429 398.0 Grand Total 1,416 1,290.8 Female staff = 1100 Male staff = 316 Trade Union Facility Time Relevant union officials The total number of Trust employees who were relevant union offici als during the relevant period are noted in table 19 Table 19 Number of employees who were relevant union officials during the relevant period Full-time equivalent employee number 9.00 9.00 Percentage of time spent on facility time The number of employees who were relevant union officials employed during the relevant period spent a) 0%, b) 1% -50%, c) 51% -99% or d) 100% of their working hours on facility time is noted in table 20.

S urveys and discussions are held with individuals and teams throughout the Trust to help strengthen existing surveys and feedback methods. In 201 8/19, the Friends and Family Test continued, facilitated via email and sent to a random sample of staff each quarter. All Trust staff are given the opportunity to participate in the survey over the year. The Trust continues to have very positive working relationships with Staff Side, through the Staff Partnership Committee, which includes medical representation. The Trust also has a Local Negoti ation Committee for medical staff. These committees confer with staff representatives to consult and negotiate on workforce policies, procedures and terms of conditions of employment. The T rust's workforce policies and procedures are negotiated and agreed through these forums . Staff Health and Wellbeing The established programme of health and wellbeing activities continues to be available to staff. The programme has been expanded throughout the year to include additional activities in direct response to staff feedback/requests, including participation in a research project around resilience, this has seen over 10% of the workforce trained in resilience techniques . A resilience app has been co -produced with staff as part of this project and will be available for all staff to use at no charge as there is a s trong focus on ensuring activities are available for difficult to reach groups including front line ward based staff . 61 There has been a focus during 2018 on financial wellbeing and the Trust will be launching a programme of support via Neyb er in March 2019 The Trust's Health and Well Being programme is supported by a core group of staff including a non - Executive D irector as Board lead and a Senior Physiotherapist as Clinical lead. A range of after work exercise classes continues to prove popular, with z umba, pilates, circuit training and yoga , Health and wellbeing days were held during 201 8 and staff were able to take advantage of general health checks and flu vaccinations. Human Rights, Equality Diversity and Inclusion (ED&I) The Walton Centre has always recognised and valued the fact that its workforce is made up of individuals with a large diversity of backgrounds, perspectives and characteristics. During 2018/19 the Trust has maintained its focus on fostering an inclusive cu lture, where staff and patients have a good experience and feel comfortable \"bringing their whole self\" to The Walton Centre. During 2018/19 , there have been a number of improvements, changes and initiatives that demonstrate the high energy levels at the Trust regarding ED&I. Equality and Diversity Objectives The Trust has continued to work towards its current equality and diversity objectives, which are: Improve data collection and equality profiles for both inpatients and outpatients Improve data colle ction and equality profiles for all staff members Ensure all staff members are paid equally for equal work Continue to use Equality Impact Assessments to monitor policies and procedures and introduce this for all service developments and organisational ch ange episodes Increase involvement with the local community and in local support groups for both patients and staff The Trust has also worked with local Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) and NHS Trusts from across Merseyside to gather evidence on healt h inequalities relating to Protected Characteristics under the Equality Act 2010. This work will inform the refresh of the Trusts ED&I Objectives in 2019. ED&I 5 Year Vision . This vision sets out the way forward for The Walton Centre to improve ED&I for both patients and staff. This is an example of the Trust going beyond statutory duties and compliance in its commitment to ED&I. The vision has come from both staff and patients, sharing what good practice looks like and how we will know when we have achieved it. Supported by a detailed strategic action plan, the vision is now being delivered by the Operational ED&I Group, who are held to account by the ED&I Steering Group. The work is monitored through the Quality Committee with an annual review of th e vision and action plan progress, in 62 the same manner that the Quality & Patient Strategy is currently monitored. This vision is guiding the Trust towards making systematic improvements around ED&I this year and in coming years : The Trust has participated in the NHS Employers Partners Programme. The Trust has renewed our charter mark and participation in the Department for Work and Pensions, Disability Confident employer scheme. The Trust has successfully completed reassessment f or the LGBT competent Navajo Chartermark. The Trust has become a member of the Navajo Health Sub Group to tackle health inequalities for LGBT patients, and now has staff trained and approved as Navajo assessors to share good practice in terms of LGBT acces sibility. The Trust has also continued to work with our ED&I Champions, who are staff volunteers, committed to making ED&I a priority. We want to be a workplace that inspires leadership at all levels, with all staff, where everyone's voice is heard. Workfo rce Diversity On 31 March 2019 the Board of Directors comprised: Three male and three female non -executive directors (including the Chair); Three male and three female executive and corporate directors Table 23 (a -f) represents the diversity of the Trust's workforce as a whole as of 31st March 2019.

The Trust has recruited some of our Black and Minority Ethnic (BME) staff to receive training to be able to support colleagues through various Human Resources (HR) Processes to ensure fairness e.g. Disciplinary, Grievance and Capability processes. There is also potential to widen their programme out into supporting fairness in recruitment processes. The Trust is in Talks with unions and colleague s from the Cheshire and Merseyside STP to progress this measure. Navajo Chartermark and Disability Confident Employer After successfully renewing the Trusts Navajo Chartermark, which is a signifier of good practice, commitment and knowledge of the specific needs, issues and barriers facing lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people in Merseyside. The Trust has continued to engage with Navajo and is now a member of the Navajo Health Sub -group, which specifically addresses health inequaliti es for the LGBT community. The Trust is also now supporting the spreading of good practice by freeing a staff member to train and become a Navajo Assessor. The Trust has also continued to participate in the Department for Work and Pensions, Disability Conf ident Employer Scheme, which commits the Trust to take positive actions to ensure that we have equitable and accessible recruitment processes relating to disability. Gender Pay Gap The Trust has met its Gender Pay Gap reporting obligations and the results are published on the Trust's website. Despite the majority of the workforce being female a high proportion of the Trust's medical and senior management roles are filled by men. This is consequently leading to a high pay gap. In addition to this, the high value of Clinical Excellence Awards is causing a huge variation of bonus pay as these are primarily awarded to males, whereas local awards, which are much lower in value, are more likely to be awarded to females as the majority of the workforce. These find ings reflect pay by gender for the previous financial year (findings as at 31 March 2017). The Trust has taken note of the results and has made use of the data to inform action planning aimed at closing the gender pay gap. Workforce Race Equality Standard (WRES) The WRES report covering the period 01 April 2017 to 31 March 2018 showed patchy progress across most of the measures. The Trust recognises that we are still near the start of our journey towards excellence in respect of the experience of BME staff. One of the actions the Trust has been taking in 2018/2019 is to boost the numbers of BME staff responding to the Annual Staff Survey, as a way of increasing our understanding of the issues that BME staff face and to identify better ways to support them 66 towards more equitable outcomes in terms of their career progression within the organisation. The Trust has seen an improvement across some of the questions within the Equality, Diversity and Inclusion theme within the 2018 staff survey. The Trust is also l ooking forward to producing and publishing the Workforce Disability Equality Standard (WDES) in 2019 . Reciprocal Mentoring The Trust has embarked on the second round of the Reciprocal Mentoring programme. The Reciprocal Mentoring scheme has been establishe d in conjunction with two other local Trusts. The aim of the programme is to tackle the disproportionately low numbers of BME staff in non -medical senior leadership roles by supporting BME staff to further their development, whilst also improving the seni or leaders understanding of what it means to be a BME employee within the Trust. 2018/19 participation is now at 10 BME staff and 5 senior leaders. Equality Delivery System The Trust's Equality Delivery System (EDS 2) review for 2018 has been undertaken an d published on the Trusts website within the Public Sector Equality Duty, Diversity and Inclusion Annual Report 2018. The Trust did not seek to increase its grades on any of the sub -goals in 2018, as the emphasis for the 2018 EDS 2 has been the work that t he Trust has been doing with other Merseyside trusts to focus on improving areas which are identified as real barriers by organisations who represent the views of people within each protected characteristic. This approach will enable real progress to be m ade in areas that make a real difference, whilst continuing to support the Trust with its duties under the Public Sector Equality Duty. Equality Impact Analysis The improved Equality Impact Assessments/Analysis (EIA) has been updated by the addition of de tailed guidance. Also the Trust's Equality and Inclusion Lead now offers advice and support to managers on the completion of EIAs. The Trust Board has also taken account of the Brown Principles and taken steps to ensure that it considers ED&I in its decisi on making e.g. by including the Equality and Inclusion Lead in the sign off process for all Cost Improvement Plans. Engagement Relationships with local Healthwatch groups have been further strengthened, with The Trust securing Healthwatch Participation in the Cheshire and Merseyside STP, ED&I Steering Group. Further details relating to ED&I and the relevant documents mentioned above are available on the Trust's website: https://www.thewaltoncentre.nhs.uk/175/equality -and-diversity.html 67 Reputation and Fundraising The Communications Team has continued to support the Trust's new strategy, introduced in 2018. Broadcast, print and social media (Facebook, Twitter and Instagram) were used effectively and proactively throughout the year. This includes utilising the Trust's quarterly magazine and website. The team was instrumental in creating and promoting the Trust's new strategy and ambitions for the next five years. Th e team was also incredibly responsive to two major incidents during the Autumn of 2018: the attempted theft of the main entrance's cash machine and the small fire in Outpatients. Work to update the annual staff awards and staff party was also carried out, which was well received by staff from across the hospital. Earlier this year, The Walton Centre featured in the hugely successful BBC Two series 'Hospital'. Viewers were able to get a unique insight into the daily decision making staff go through to ensure patients get the best care possible when they visit the Trust. The overall series filmed in six Trusts across Merseyside to gather a living picture of the health system working across a city region. Over two million people watched the episode featuring Wa lton patients and staff the week the episode aired and #Hospital trended on Twitter throughout the series. The predominant media coverage we had in 2018 was the initial and ongoing coverage of the Liverpool Football attack. It dominated the headlines for a number of weeks, and the subsequent developments in the patient's c ondition and transfer closer to home in Ireland always spiked in our monitoring of media coverage. The major incidents also featured highly on all channels. In all instances the team worke d well with external partners (police etc .) to get the messages out to patients and visitors. A highlight to the coverage was our celebration of NHS70, which also resulted in a special edition of the Trust's quarterly magazine. The Communications Team created the Trust's first Instagram account, which to date has nearly 1,200 followers. The Facebook and Twitter pages continue to grow - Facebook has nearly 6,000 followers and the Twitter page has over 8,500. They proved their worth this year during the m ajor incidents, becoming trusted sources for important updates on access to the hospital. The current website has a sizeable audience - it was visited by almost 150,000 users last year, of which 60% used mobile devices or tablets. Plans are in place for a new website to be implemented in the near future. Fundraising During the year under review, awareness of and support for The Walton Centre Charity continued to grow. The income for the year was \u00a3698,000, which is an increase of \u00a3232,000 on the previous yea r despite not having a focus of a specific appeal to help drive fundraising. There were some particular elements which 68 contributed to this increase, including a number of legacies totalling over \u00a3140,000, as well as two gala dinner events organised by sup porters which totalled over \u00a350,000 for the charity. There was yet again an increase in the number of supporters using on -line fundraising platforms such as Justgiving and Virgin Money Giving to facilitate their sponsored events and maximise gift -aid oppo rtunities. This year also saw the Charity benefit from 'Charity of the Year' support from two companies, where staff voted to dedicate fundraising support to benefit The Walton Centre for 12 months. In addition to raising awareness and unrestricted fund s, the Charity also continued to raise funds for specific purposes such as the Home from Home Fund and the Sid Watkins Innovation Fund. Donations to the Home from Home Fund ensure that the Trust can provide the facility free of charge to relatives whose loved ones are receiving critical care at the hospital; and The Sid Watkins Innovation Fund supports innovation and research in the field of neurological health care. The Golf Day and the Jan Fairclough Ball which are organised by the Charity, both raised money for The Sid Watkins Fund during the year - \u00a320,000 and \u00a350,000 respectively - whereas \u00a325,000 from the Hope Mountain Hike benefitted the Home from Home Fund. Work has also continued on implementing the process through which ideas/requests can be iden tified and considered as potential future fundraising projects. The pr ocess links in with the Trust's Medical Innovation Group, which was established to help create an organisational culture where all members of staff are encouraged to think creatively to enable practical innovations to improve patient care. Specific emphasis has been on developments in complex rehabilitation , specifically movement and posture analysis, and it is anticipated that this will become the focus of a fundraising appeal to be lau nched in 2019/2020. During the year under review, the charity has also developed a dedicated website which will provide the functionality necessary to provide a fully integrated and fundraising focused digital platform to help the charity raise awareness a nd funds. The web site was launched in March 2019. Consultancy During the year, the Trust made use of external, objective advice and assistance to support the development of strategy, structure and management of the Trust's purposes and objectives. This is typically when a team or service is being reviewed and expert support can be particularly helpful in understanding complex requirements and enabling the smooth running of new governance, team arrangements and individual responsibilities. There are also occasions during the normal running of services that individual staff members will benefit from additional support and a good example of this would be performance coaching which sometimes needs to be drawn from outside the Trust and oc casionally from beyo nd the NHS. Reporting high paid off -payroll arrangements 69 The Trust does not routinely utilise any off payroll staff for the delivery of main stream services. However, where there are skills shortages, time limited arrangements are entered into by the Trus t, with regular review undertaken by the relevant director. Where the engagement lasts for more than six months, the Trust seeks assurance that the appropriate HMRC regulations are being followed. The Trust has not had any off -payroll engagements with boar d members or any other senior officials with significant financial responsibility during the period. Other off -payroll arrangements are reflect ed in tables 24, 25 and 26 : Table 24 All off -payroll engagements as at 31 March 2019 (where the worker is paid more than \u00a3245 per day and has been in post for more than six months) Number of existing arrangements as at 31 March 2 019 1 Of which: Number that have existed for less than one year at the time of reporting 0 Number that have existed for between one and two years at the time of reporting 0 Number that have existed for between two and three years at the time of reporting 0 Number that have existed for between three and four years at the time of reporting 0 Number that have existed for four or more years at the time of reporting 1 The Trust has undertaken a risk assessment of the off -payroll engagements outlined above and off -payroll arrangements are reviewed through the relevant committee. Where necessary, assurance has been sought that the individual is paying the correct amount of income tax and National Insurance.

Developing an Understanding: Board of Directors and Council of Governors The Board of Directors has taken steps to ensure the Board's directors, and in particular non -executive directors, develop an understanding of the views of governors and members about the Trust. Ms Janet Rosser chairs both the Board of Directors and the C ouncil of Governors, with the support of the Deputy Director of Governance (until January 2019) and the A ssistant Corporate Secretary, who act as the link between the two. The full Council of Governors meets four times a year and these meetings are attende d by non -executive directors, the senior independent director, the Chief Executive and when required executive and corporate directors. Governors meetings provide the opportunity for the governors to perform their statutory duties, express their views, and raise any issues so the Board of Directors can respond. To fulfil their role in holding the non -executive Directors to account and scrutiny of the Trust Auditors, the Governors attend meetings of the Board of Directors and the Audit Committee. The Trust recognises the importance of governors being accessible to members. Council of Governors meetings are public meetings and agendas and minutes from the meetings, together with details of how members can contact governors, are publicised on the Trust's webs ite. Annual Members Meetings are held which are open to the public. Photographs of the Trust's governors are displayed in a prominent place in the reception of the Trust's main building.

The Committee m et on five occasions during 2018/19 . Meetings of the Trust's Audit Committee and attendance h ave been represented in table 36 as follows during th e reporting period 01 April 2018 to 31 March 2019 : Table 36 April 20 18 May 20 18 July 20 18 Oct 20 18 Jan 20 19 Alan Sharples Ann McCracken A Seth Crofts =Present A=Apologies The Role of the Audit Committee: The Audit Committee critically reviews the governance and assurance processes upon which the Board of Directors places reliance. Three Non -Executive Directors are members of the Audit Committee, reflecting the importance that the Board places on the Audit Committee to enable effective Non Executive challenge, including triangulation of the work of the Board's Assurance Committees (Business Performance Committee and Quality Committee) across all aspects of the Trust's business. Principal Revie w Areas in 2018/19 The narrative below sets out the princ ipal areas of review and significant issues considered by the Audit Committee during 2018/19 reflecting the key objectives of the committee as set out in its terms of reference. Internal Control and Risk Management The Committee has reviewed relevan t dis closure statements for 2018/19 and other appropriate independent assurance together with the Head of Internal Audit Opinion, external audit opi nion and considers that the 2018/19 Annual Governance Statement is consistent with the Committee's view on the Trust's system of internal control. 83 Reviews undertaken in 2 018/19 included: Where limited assurance was received , the committee deliberated the report with follow up audits/review of action plans and invited the relevant management lead to attend the next Committee meeting to provide a progress update on recommendations. Governance, Risk Management and Internal Control The wor k of the Audit Committee in 2018/19 has been to review the effectiveness of the organisation and its systems of governance, risk management and internal control through a programme of work involving the scrutiny of assurances provided by internal audit, external audit, local anti -fraud offi cer, Trust managers, finance staff and the clinical audit team along with reports and reviews from other external bodies. An annual work programme is set at the start of the year along with agreement of the internal audit and anti-fraud work plans, with pr ovision to meet contingency requirements. Review of the Work of the Auditors The Audit Committee undertook a review of the work of both internal and external auditors during the year, with the Audit Committee receiving a report at its July 201 8 meeting, wh ich was approved by the Committee. The Committee reviews the establishment and maintenance of an effective system of integrated governance, risk management and internal control across the whole of the Trust's activities, both clinical and non -clinical, th at supports the achievement of the Trust's objectives. Review Title Assurance Level Activity Data High Accounts Receivable High General Ledger High Treasury Management High Budgetary Control High Data Security and Protection Toolkit Substantial ESR Substantial Accounts Payable Substantial Financial Reporting and Integrity Substantial Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards Limited Management of Controlled Drugs Limited Sickness Absence Limited Agency Cap Limited Overseas Patients Advisory 84 In addition, the Committee monitors the integrity of the financial statements of the Trust, and any formal announcements relating to the Trust's financial performance, reviewing significant financial reports and the judgments contained in them. In particular, the Committee reviews the adequacy of: All risk and control related disclosure statements, in particular the Annual Governance Statement and declarations of compliance with the CQC outcomes, toget her with any accompanying Director of Internal Audit statement, external audit opinion or other appropriate independent assurances, prior to endorsement by the Board of Directors. Underlying assurance processes that indicate the degree of the achievement o f corporate objectives, the effectiveness of the management of principal risks and the appropriateness of the above disclosure statements. Policies for ensuring compliance with relevant regulatory, legal and code of conduct requirements. Policies and proce dures for all work related to fraud and corruption. In carrying out this work, the Committee primarily utilises the work of internal audit, external audit and other assurance functions and also makes requests of, and receives reports and assurances from, d irectors and managers as appropriate and by using an effective assurance framework / Trust -wide risk register to guide its work and that of the audit and assurance functions that report to it. Internal Audit Throughout the year, the Audit Committee has worked effectively with Mersey Internal Audit Agency (MIAA) , the Trust's appointed internal audit ors, to ensure that the design and operation of the Trust's internal control processes are sufficiently robust. The Audit Committee has continued to give consi derable attention to the importance of follow up in respect of internal audit work in order to gain assurance that appropriate management action has been implemented. The latest follow up report received by the Committee in January 2019, noted that good progress had been made to action a number of the recommendations but that some recommendations still needed to be implemented. The Chair of the Audit Committee had asked for concerted efforts to be made to action the outstanding recommendations by April 2019. The Audit Committee has considered the major findings of internal audit and , where appropriate , has sought management as surance that remedial action has been taken. 'Limited assurance' was assigned to the 4 review s in 2018/19 . The Committee requested sight of the full report s including management response and attendance at the meeting by the relevant Trust lead. This has continued to strengthen the Committee's response to major audit findings and has ensured that any control weaknesses are understood by the Audit committee and are quickly addressed. 85 The Committee reviewed and approved the internal audit plan and detailed p rogramm e of work for 2018/19 at its April 2018 meeting. This included a range of key risks identified through discussion with Management and Executives and review of the Trust's Board Assurance Framework. Reviews were identified across a range of areas, in cluding BAF R isks Mersey Internal Audit Agency (MIAA) has supported the non -executive directors over the year through the provision of networking events, policy advice, and Insight updates. MIAA routinely reviews the papers received by the Board of Directo rs and minutes of Board meetings to pick up on areas of potential risk for inclusion in the audit programme. Anti- Fraud The Committee reviewed and approved t he anti-fraud work plan for 2018/19 at its April 201 8 meeting noting coverage across all mandated areas of strategic governance, inform and involve, prevent and deter and hold to account. During the course of the year the Committee regularly reviewed updates on proactive anti-fraud work . External Audit The Committee routinely received progress reports from the external auditor, including an update on the annual accounts audit timetable and programme of work, updates on key emerging national issues and developments which may be of interest to Committee member s alongside a number of challenge questions in respect of these emerging issues , to which the Committee provided a manageme nt response. The value of external audit services for the year was \u00a347,000 (including VAT) , the limited assurance report on the Quality Account was \u00a37,000 (including VAT) and the independent examination of the Charity was \u00a31,000 . During 2018/19 , the auditor has not been eng aged in any non -audit activity . The Trust's external auditors, Grant Tho rnton UK LLP , were appointed by the Council of Governors in April 2017 following a formal procurement exercise for a contract period of three accounting years, with an option to extend for a further accounting year. The Audit C ommittee included a number of significant accounting issues and treatments in its consideration of the Trust's financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2019 . During the year the committee critically addressed the issues around the appropriateness of the Accounting Policies tha t have been adopted and was satisfied that the policies were reasonable and appropriate. As part of the full year reporting process the external auditors, Grant Thornton, consider the key areas of accounting judgement and disclosure. For each of these area s, the audit committee critically review and assess the policies and judgements that have been applied, the consistency of policy application from year to year and the appropriateness of the relevant disclosures made, together with the compliance with appl icable accounting 86 standards. The key areas of accounting judgement and disclosure are shown in the Trust 's final accounts. The committee has been able to place reliance upon work und ertaken by the External auditors as part of the work that the y undertook t o enable them to develop their Audit Opinion. The following additional significant issues have been discussed by the Audit Committee during 2018/19 : the accuracy of income recorded in relation to patient care activities, in particular income related to additional NHS contract activity; the risk of management over -ride of controls (which includes an understanding of accounting judgements applied); Risk around payment of HRG4+ tariff by Welsh commissioners; Valuation of property, plan t and equipment. Other Assurance Functions The Audit Committee has routinely received reports on Losses and Special Payments, Gifts and Hospitality, Bad Debts and Tender Waivers. The Audit Committee has reviewed and agreed the updated Standing Financial Instruction s and Schem e of Reservation and Delegation for Board approval. Members of the Audit Committee have met privately with the internal and external auditors, without the presence of any Trust officer. Financial Reporting The Audit Committee has reviewed the accounting policies and annual financial statements prior to submission to the Board and considered these to be accurate. It has ensured that all external audit recommendations have been addressed. Review of Audit Committee Effectiveness During 2018 , the Audit Committee undertook its annual self -assessment , including a review of its Terms of Reference, via a survey sent to Audit Committee members. A report and action plan was developed and presented to the Audit Committee in October 2018. Walton Centre Chari ty Committee (WCCC) The role of the WCCC is to ensure the Charity is managed and administered in accordance with the requirements of the Charity Commission and that the Charity produces audited Annual Accounts. It ensures that the Charity has an investm ent policy in place; that this is reviewed at least annually and that the Committee receives at least an annual report from its investment managers/advisors. 87 The Committee also ensures that items of expenditure are approved in line with the objectives of t he fund, and are charitable in nature, and that the Charity can demonstrate public benefit for its expenditure. Through delegated authority from the Trust Board, it establishes the strategy, policies, budget, spending priorities and criteria for spending decisions for each fund. The strategy and policies must comply with charity law and the specific objectives of each fund. In addition, the WCCC oversees all fundraising activities relating to the Charity, ensuring that they are in line and in accordance w ith 'The Code of Fundraising Practice' as overseen by the Fundraising Regulator. It develops and recommends fundraising appeals for approval by the Trust Board, in line with and support of the Trust's strategic vision, and monitors subsequent fundraising targets.

Compliance with the Cost Allocation and Charging Requirements set out in HM Treasury and Office of Public Sector Information Guidance The Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust has complied with the cost allocation and charging requirements set out in HM Treasury and Office of Public Sector Information Guidance. The Trust complies with the Approved Costing Guidance and standards issued by NHS Improvement in 2018 . The Trust's Finance Department works with all departments within the Trust to use the activity information available within the Trust and an established NHS costing package to appropriately allocate expenditure to services and patients. 91 Contracts The Trust has many contracts for goods and services with numerous suppliers in the private and public sectors. Whilst all are important the following are regarded as essential to the daily operation of the business and would be difficult to change at short notice: The close proximity of Aintree University Hospital means that the Trust can benefit from economies of scale by using their infrastructure to provide some of its support services. There is a service level agreement in place to cover these services which include Pharmacy Services as well as many estates functions including the provision of utilities and emergency maintenance. The EBME service has undergone a full tender exercise in year and the contract has been awarded to Royal Liverpool and Broad green University Hospitals NHS Trust until March 2021 (the contract was previously held with Aintree University Hospital until March 2018 ).

The ratings for The Walton Centre Foundation Trust over the last two years ar e summarised in the tables overleaf . Ratings awarded at the start of the year are based on the expected performance at the time of the annual risk assessment in our annual plan. The quarterly ratings are based on actual performance reported to NHS Improvement, via quarterly in -year submissions. NHS Improvement moved to the Single Oversight Framework in October 2016. Single Oversight Framework NHS Improvement's Single Oversight Framework provides the framework for overseeing providers and identifying potential support needs. The framework looks at five themes: Quality of care Finance and use of resources Operational performance Strategic change Leadership and improvemen t capability (well -led). Based on information from these themes, providers are placed in a segmentation rating from 1 to 4, where '4' reflects providers receiving the most support, and '1' reflects providers with maximum autonomy. A foundation trust will be in segments 3 or 4 where it has been found to be in breach or suspected breach of its licence. Segmentation Following a review of the Trust 's financial position The Walton Centre Foundation Trust was placed in segment 1 . This is the lowest level of oversight with no potential support needs having been identified resulting in maximum autonomy within the Single Oversight Framework. Finance and use of resources The finance and use of resources theme is based on the scoring of five measures from '1' to '4', where '1' reflects the strongest performance. These scores are then weighted to provide an overall score. Gi ven that finance and use of resources is only one of the five themes feeding into the Single Oversight Framework, the segmentation of the trust disclosed above might not be the same as the overall finance score shown in the table below. 94 Table 39 Area Metric 2018/19 Sustainability Capital Service Capacity 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 2 Liquidity 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 Financial Efficiency I&E Margin 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 Financial Controls Distance from plan 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 1 Agency Spend 1 2 3 3 1 1 1 1 Use of Resource Risk Rating 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 Governance Rating NHS Improvement use a combination of methods to assess governance issues at NHS foundation trusts and to gain assurance of their standards of governance. Trusts are rated green where there are no concerns, red where they are under formal regulatory investigation or 'under re view' where concerns have been identified by the trust or its regulators which require further investigation.

The relevant responsibilities of the accounting officer, including their responsibility for the propriety and regularity of public finances for which th ey are answerable, and for the keeping of proper accounts, are set out in the NHS Foundation Trust Accounting Officer Memorandum issued by NHS Improvement. NHS Improvement, in exercise of the powers conferred on Monitor by the NHS Act 2006, has given Acco unts Directions which require The Walton Centre NHS foundation trust to prepare for each financial year a statement of accounts in the form and on the basis required by those Directions. The accounts are prepared on an accruals basis and must give a true a nd fair view of the state of affairs of The Walton Centre NHS foundation trust and of its income and expenditure, total recognised gains and losses and cash flows for the financial year. In preparing the accounts, the Accounting Officer is required to comply with the requirements of the Department of Health Group Accounting Manual and in particular to: observe the Accounts Direction issued by NHS Improvement, including the relevant accoun ting and disclosure requirements, and apply suitable accounting policies on a consistent basis make judgements and estimates on a reasonable basis state whether applicable accounting standards as set out in the NHS Foundation Trust Annual Reporting Manua l (and the Department of Health Group Accounting Manual ) have been followed, and disclose and explain any material departures in the financial statements ensure that the use of public funds complies with the relevant legislation, delegated authorities and guidance ; and prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis. The accounting officer is responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the NHS foundation trust a nd to enable him/her to ensure that the accounts comply with requirements outlined in the above mentioned Act. The Accounting Officer is also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the NHS foundation trust and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. To the best of my knowledge and belief, I have properly discharged the responsibilities set out in the NHS Foundation Trust Accounting Officer Memorandum . 96 Signed Hayley Citrine, Chief Executive Date: 24 May 2019 97 3vii Accountability Report - annual governance statement Scope of Responsibility As Accounting Officer, I have responsibility for maintaining a sound system of internal control that supports the achievement of the NHS Foundation Trust' s policies, aims and objectives; whilst safeguarding the public funds and departmental assets for wh ich I am personally responsible and in accordance with the responsibilities assigned to me. I am also responsible fo r ensuring that The Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust is administered prudently and economically and that resources are applied efficiently and effectively. I also acknowledge my responsibilities as set out in NHS Foundation Trust Accounting Officer Memor andum . The Trust is required to register with the Care Quality Commission (CQC). Its current registration status is ' fully compliant\" with the registered requirements . On March 5th, 2019 the Trust was subject to a routine unannounced inspection by the CQC. The inspection started on 5th March 2019 and ended on the 8th March 2019 and was attended by six inspectors. The high level feedback was positive and reflected the caring nature of the Trust. The CQC have planned an inspection against the Well Led Key Lines of Enquiry, this will take place between the 16th to the 18th of April. Engagement meetings between the CQC and the Trust have continued to be held throughout the year , although due to challenges within the CQC workforce have not been held quarterly . The meetings which have been held have been attended by the CQC Engagement Manager, the Director of Nursing and Governance and the Deputy Director o f Governance and where there had been a specific topic for discuss ion the relevant specialist was invited. Within the year Lisa Salter was appointed as the Director of Nursing and Governance having Executive responsibility for engagement with the CQC . As an employer with staff entitled to me mbership of the NHS Pension Scheme, control measures are in place to ensure all employer obligations contained within the Scheme regulations are complied with. This includes ensuring that deductions from salary, employer's contributions and payments into t he Scheme are in accordance with the Scheme rules, and that member Pension Scheme records are accurately updated in accordance with the timescales detailed in the Regulations Processes are in place which assure the Board that workforce strategies and staffing systems are in place which ensure the board that staffing processes are safe, sustainable 98 and effective. The workforce strategy is being reviewed in line with the revised Trust Strategy and will be publishe d in quarter 2, 2019. The Trust has in place an annual workforce plan which is assured and monitored through the performance reporting process . Para 4.4 in the Quality Report details how safer staffing for the nursing workforce is monitored. During 2019/20 the safer staffing report will include all clinical staff in line with workforce safeguards recommendations. The Trust published all relevant equality progress in its Public Sector Equality Duty Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Annual Report 2018. http://www.thewaltoncentre.nhs.uk/uploadedfiles/HR/Equality%20Duty%20Annual%20Repor t%202018.pdf Equality and Inclusion activity is monitored by the Trust Board and Quality Committee. Equality and Inclusion work is progressed via the Equality Diversity and Inclusion (ED&I) Steering Group and the ED&I Operational Group. The purpose of the system of internal control The system of internal control is design ed to manage risk to a reasonable level rather than to eliminate all risk of failure; it can therefore only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance of effectiveness. The system of internal control is based on an on -going process designed to identify and prioritise the risks to the achievement of the Trust strategies, policies, aims and objectives of The Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust, to evaluate the likelihood of those risks being realised and the impact should they be realised, and to manage the m efficiently, effectively and economically. The system of internal control has been in place in The Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust f or the year ended 31 March 2019 and up to the date of approval of the annual report and accounts. There have been no significant control issues identified. Capacity to handle risk The Board of Directors collectively takes a proactive role in providing leadership to the organisational risk management process. The Trust has a Risk Management Strategy which was approved b y the Quality Committee in October 2016. The Risk Management Strategy identifies the objectives in table 42 : 99 Table 42 Objective No Objective Description Objective No 1 Define the organisations risk appetite Objective No 2 Ensure a single and comprehensive risk management process Objective No 3 Increase the coverage and utilisation of appropriate risk assessments throughout the Trust Objective No 4 Increase the use of Trust wide data to inform the risk management process Objective No 5 Enhance the knowledge and skills base of staff in risk management across the Trust, thereby also further encouraging an open and transparent reporting culture Objective No 6 Strengthen the system of assurance regarding risk through to Board level Complia nce with the objectives of the strategy is monitored by the Quality Committee and was last presented in November 2018 . The Trust also has a Risk Management Policy which sets out the roles and responsibilities of the chief executive, executive directors, ex ecutive director with responsibility for risk, and the managerial roles key to the co -ordination of risk management throughout the organisation. The policy clearly states that all Trust employees have a responsibility for the management of risk; it also d escribes the systems of governance process for the management of risk. The following committees of the Board of Directors have delegated powers for the responsibility of monitoring high -level risks within their terms of reference: Quality Committee Business Perform ance Committee Audit Committee The Quality Committee is chaired by a Non -Executive Director and in order to ensure appropriate challenge, part of its constit ution includes attendance by two other Non - Executive Director s. The terms of r eference of the committee require it to act as a scrutiny committee, providing assurance to the Trust Board that adequate and appropriate checks and balances are in place, and that controls which arise from risk assessment and mitigation processes are robust. The Quality C ommittee is also responsible for the review of the Trust Risk Register which is formed by those risks which are held on the operational risk registers and are rated as 12 and above. Also included in the Quality Committee Terms of Reference is the quarterly review of those risks on the Board Assurance Framework for which it has designated responsibility . 100 The Business Performance Committee is chaired by a Non -Executive Director; and in order to ensure appropriate challenge, part of its constit ution includes attendance by two other Non-Executive Director s. The committee's responsibilities relating to risk management require the scrutiny of those risks on the Board Assurance Framework for which it has designated responsibility. The committee provi des assurance to the Trust Board that the systems and processes are robust and, if required, has the capacity to escalate issues to the Trust Board. During the year 2018/19 , the Business Performance Committee has requested detailed reports on specific risk s included on the Board Assurance Framework; this has enabled the committee to provide assurance to the Trust Board that those adequate checks and balances were in place. The Audit Committee is chaired by a Non -Executive Director, and its membership is constituted of two other independent Non -Executive Director members. Governors of the Trust are invited to observe the committee and are required to act as a link between the Audit Committee and the Council of Governors, thus ensuring transparency and promoting engagement. The Audit Committee has oversight of the system of risk management and assurance, including the Board Assurance Framework. It has a cycle of business that requires attendance by members of the senior management team to provide assurance in relation to the effective design and operation of systems of control that fall within their respective portfolios. The Register of Interests is a fixed item on the Audit Committee agenda and the Trust has published an up -to-date register of interests for decision -making staff within the past twelve months, as required by the \"Managing Conflicts of Interest in the NHS'22 guidance. The Patient Safety Group reports into the Quality Committee. The Terms of Reference of the Patient Safety Group reflect the scrutiny and oversight function of the operational elements of risk and governance throughout the organisation. Divisional risk registers are presented to, and scrutinised by, the group on a rotational basis; at meetings where divisions are not scheduled to fully review their registers, an exception repo rt informs the group of new risks and those which have been archived . This process ensures cross divisional challenge and a Trust -wide consistency in the grading of risks, which in turn, provides a standardised organisational risk profile. The Patient Safety Group is also responsible for the scrutiny of serious untoward incidents, root cause analyses, safety alerts and relat ed action plans. Monthly multidisciplinary divisional governance and risk meetings are held in each of the divisions, all o f which have core agenda items which include the review of risk register s, complaints, incidents and health and safety issues. The Chair 's reports from these groups report into the Quality Committee. 101 A Harm Free Care Board which is comprised of lead nurses and members of the governance department meet each week to continually review risk registers, monitor progress of root cause analy sis investigations and complaints. A serious incident meeting is also held on a two -weekly basis where cases of concern are discussed and managed. This may be an incident, complaint, concern or risk related issue. The meeting is attended by the Medical Di rector, Director of Nursing and Governance, Clinical Director for Anaesthesia and the Divisional risk leads . Information flows through to the Quality Assurance Committee and to the specialised commissioners. The Trust holds quarterly Council of Governors S teering Group meetings which act as a forum for discussion and engagement with the governors. The steering group also agrees the agenda for the quarterly Council of Governors meetings . The Council of Governors meetings e nable governor consultation and provides an oversight and scrutiny function. Development of the Council of Governors is referenced in section 3iv. The Trust -wide safety huddle which was introduced in 2017 has further improved internal communications relating to the management of risk. Attend ance at the meeting has increased and it now has representation from all specialties within the organisation . Meeting s are held each weekday morning for approximately 20 minutes to support excellent communication and champion safety. The Board Assurance F ramework is reviewed and monitored each quarter by the Executive Team, the board committees and the Trust Board. This scrutiny allows the Board of Directors to satisfy itself that risks which threaten the achievement of strategic objectives are under prudent control and fall within the Board's risk appetite. The Audit Committee reviews the framework each quarter ensuring that the correct governance process has been followed. The Quality Committee and the Busi ness Performance Committee review the specif ic risks for which they have delegated responsibility. To ensure that the Trust's approach to managing risk is successfully implemented and maintained, staff at all levels are provided with appropriate risk management and incident report training which is appropriate to their role and responsibility within the organisation. Training includes, but is not limited to: incident reporting, health and safety, risk management, fire safety, infection control and prevention, information governance, root cause ana lysis, complaints management, equality and diversity, safeguarding children and vulnerable adults, conflict resolution and basic life support. Other risk management training is provided on a formal and ad hoc basis as part of the corporate learning and de velopment programme. 102 A training needs analysis has been developed which is managed by the training and development function and is monitored through the performance management process . This identifies the initial and on -going mandatory training requireme nts for all employees. All new starters attend a mandatory induction programme which covers all areas of risk management. The Trust is an accredited centre for the Institution of Occupational Safety and Health (IOSH) Managing Safely course for senior staf f. This is an internationally recognised certificate of competence. Training in the use of Datix is provided to all staff. There is also an accessible, specialist system lead based centrally with the Risk Management Team. All staff can access the Datix s ystem to report an incident online. Line manager s quality check the data before the information is validated and referred to the appropriate person in the organisation. Escalation is based on the risk rating score of the issue reported. The Trust contin ually strives to improve its risk management performance by capturing good practice and lessons learned from a wealth of sources including complaints, litigation, incidents, audits and reviews. To facilitate the learning of lessons from incidents, the Tru st uses the following processes: a regular Lessons Learned newsletter, inclusion in monthly assurance reports to the specific wards and departments, inclusion in the quarterly governance and risk report and inclusion in the monthly Team Brief and weekly em ail bulletin to staff, Walton Weekly and the Trust and ward safety huddle. The Trust has continued to develop the root cause a nalysis action and assurance tracker. This records proposed actions from investigations and holds the evidence to demonstrate that any recommended action has been taken . The tracker is reviewed each week at the Harm Free Care Board and the monthly divisional governance and risk meetings. The Trust fully acknowledges its duty of candour which supports one of its core values of openne ss. Incidents which fall into the requirements of the regulations are identified through the daily scrutiny of the Datix system. Relevant incidents are identified and entered onto a tracker which manages Trust compliance to the Duty of Candour regulations. All patients, and in some circumstances relatives, who fall into the duty of candour requirements are offered an apology by the relevant clinician as soon as possible and this is recorded in the patient records. The patient or relative will then receive a letter offering an apology which is signed by the Chief Executive. The letter of apology also includes an offer for the relative/family/carer to contribute to the subsequent investigation and enquires whether the recipient would like to receive a copy of the final root cause analysis investigation. 103 During the year the Trust significantly improve d its policy development and management processes through the development of a folder which is held on \"SharePoint\". This enables acces s from the authors directly, provides alerts and a lso provides an audit trail to demonstrate assurance. All policies support patient care , are fit for purpose and are approved and ratified by a nominated group/committee. Strategies and policies relating to risk management are kept under review throughout the year. All risk and control related policies have an equality imp act assessment completed as required by the Trust's document control arrangements. Any proposed cost improvement plans undergo a quality impact assessment to ensure that any changes in funding to services or schemes do not increase risk unexpectedly or ne gatively impact on patient safety, patient experience or clinical effectiveness of the service. The Trust's Risk Management team is a component of a wider governance department which integrates all components of risk for effective control and greater effi ciencies. The Risk and Control Framework: Risk Management Risks are identified, assessed and recorded by senior managers who input information from risk assessments onto Datix, an electronic web based risk management solution. Formal risk management rep orts and registers are managed at divisional governance meetings and reviewed with local departmental managers. The Board of Directors recognises the value of taking a strategic, proactive and comprehensive approach to the assessment and the control of r isk. The Trust appreciates the variety of significant benefits which can be achieved from improving patient care and the safety of the working environment for its staff, which assist in reducing levels of financial risk and loss for the organisation as a whole. The Board of Directors consider the nature and extent of the risks facing the organisation, the amount and type of risk identified, the likelihood that the risk might materialise and the ability to control the impact of the risk. At the beginning of each year, the Board scores the risk of failure to achieve its strategic objectives and identifies a target score for that risk. The target score may be at the same level (where the Board has an appetite for that risk) or lower (where the risk score is intolerable and must be mitigated to a lower level). The Board's appetite toward compliance with statutory legislation is to refrain from risks which may prevent compliance. On this basis the risk appetite aligned to the strategic priorities should not be taken into consideration for compliance related decisions. The Board has set a risk appetite of Cautious. This reflects the environment that the organisation is currently operating in and the need to be innovative when considering options 104 for improvem ent. This does not indicate that the Board is seeking to undertake 'risky behaviour' . To ensure consistency in process, all risk assessments are completed using the ISO 3100 Risk Management Standard and evaluated using a 5x5 risk grading matrix which is described in the Trust Risk Management Policy. All risk assessments, including information on evaluation and control, are recorded on Datix and supported by action plans which are rigorously monitored at the weekly Harm Free Care Group, monthly Divisional G overnance Groups, and the Patient Safety Group. Lessons learned from risk assessments and serious untoward incidents are shared via the monthly ward and department assurance reports, the monthly divisional governance reports, the quarterly Governance and R isk Report, the Incident Feedback , Team Brief, Trust Safety Huddle, Walton Weekly and through email bulletins to all staff. As at 31 March 2019 , the Board Assurance Framework identified twelve risks to the strategic objectives. All risks have robust controls and treatment plans to mitigate the risk as far as reasonably practicable. Therefore, the level of risk will decrease once risk treatment is effective. Compliance to the UK Corporate Governance Code is explained in section 3iv of this document, c ompliance with th e single oversight framework found in section 3v. Development of the Council of Governors is referenced in section 3 iv. Major Risks: The major risks both in year and future are listed in table 43 . These will be continually monitored thro ugh the year and updated as necessary.

Improved staff s upport The Trust submitted the annual business plan (including operational plan) to NHS Improvement by the required deadline, following Board approval. The Trust declared a position of compliance to the following three licence conditions; this is evidenced through the Audit Committee and Trust Board in April 2019 . Condition G6: The provider has taken all precautions necessary to comply with the lic ence, NHS Acts and NHS Constitution; Condition FT4: The provider has complied with required governance arrangements; Condition CoS7: If providing commissioner requested services, the provider has a reasonable expectation that required resources will be available to deliver the designated service. 108 In respect of the principal risks to compliance with the NH S FT condition 4 (FT Governance), The Walton Centre has a Board of Directors and has established a committee structure with associated reporting lines, performance and risk management systems. Each committee is chaired by a non -executive director and has a n associated executive team member as its executive lead. The Board of Directors and Board Committees receive timely and accurate information to assess risks to compliance with the Trust's provider licence and have the requisite degree and rigour of overs ight over the Trust's performance. To assure itself of the validity of its annual governance statement required under NHS FT Condition 4 (8) b, the Board of Directors receives an annual assurance statement and associated evidence. The Board of Directors approve quarterly reports for submission to the sector regulator NHSI, regarding its principal risks to compliance with its Governance and Continuity of Service ratings Mersey Internal Audit Agency completed 13 reviews of the systems of internal control du ring the year. 5 achieved high assurance, 4 achieved substantial assurance and 4 of the reviews received limited assurance. The review that achieved limited assurance had been supported by robust action plans in order to address the recom mendations . The Trust was subject to a full \"Well Led\" self -assessment as required by NHSI in 2015 and completed a subsequent initial self -assessment against the NHSI Well Led framework in 2018; this review was facilitated by an external reviewer. The Trust will undergo a second full self-assessment in December of 2019. Emergency Preparedness Resi lience and Response (EPRR) As a Specialist Trust, we are classified as a Category 1 (primary responder) under the Civil Contingencies Act (CCA) 2004. As a part of the Major Traum a Centre, we are at the core of emergency response and are subject to the full set of civil protection duties: assess the risk of emergencies occurring and use this to inform contingency planning put in place emergency plans put in place business continuity management arrangements put in place arrangements to make information available to the public about civil protection matters and maintain arrangements to warn, inform and advise the public in the event of an emergency share information with othe r local responders to enhance co -ordination cooperate with other local responders to enhance co -ordination and efficiency The NHS England Core Standards for Emergency Preparedness Resilience and Response (EPRR) are the minimum standards which NHS organisat ions and providers of NHS funded 109 care must meet. The Trust is required to follow the EPRR framework and delivery of the NHS England Core Standards. These are the minimum standards which NHS Organisations and providers of NHS funded care must meet and provi de assurance around EPRR to the Commissioning Board. In 2018/19 the Trust has continued to invest both time and resources in its emergency preparedness, resilience and response. The 2018/19 self -assessment against the NHS England Core Standards shows that , of the 51 applicable standards, the Trust is fully compliant. In 2018/19, the Trusts EPRR arrangements were revised taking into account the learning from the Trusts annual major incident exercise as well as a number of internal incidents. This learning h as resulted in a clear improvement of the Trust's emergency preparedness, as demonstrated by: 1. The Trust achieving full compliance against all of NHS England's core standards for EPRR. 2. The activation of the Trusts Major Incident Plan and fire evacuation pla ns following a small fire, which resulted in the successful evacuation of two wards and swift recovery of the hospital to business as normal . 3. Regular post incident debriefing . 4. Utilising the learning from internal and external incidents to improve incident plans and inform the resilience training programme . 5. Participation in Public Health England (PHE) clinically led Major Incident Exercise Golden Eagle. 6. The Trust Major Incident Plan and associated action cards were revised with input from Consultant Surgeons/Anaesthetists. 7. Training for incident loggists. 8. Investment in incident control room equipment including handheld radio s (with a dedicated emergency channel) , telephones and bespoke high visibilty clothing for major incident staff. 9. Having two senior managers successfully attain accreditation to deliver the internationally accredited Emergo Emergency Train System (a simulation educational tool for training and testing the preparedness and management of emergencies, major incidents and disast ers). 10. Continued review and testing of Business Continuity Plans. A new EPRR work programme for 2019/20 will be overseen by the Trust's Resilience Planning Group and, if completed in full, will enable the Trust in 2019/20 to achieve full compliance against all of NHS England's core standards for EPRR. 110 Carbon Reduction Plans are in place and the Trust has undertaken risk assessments in accordance with the emergency preparedness and civil contingency requirements , as based on UKCIP 2009 weather projects . The T rusts is compliant with its obligations under the Climate Change Act and the Adaptation Reporting requirements . Information Governance With regard to information security risks, the Trust has a nominated Senior Information Risk Officer (SIRO) at executive level who has nominated responsibility for information risk. The Data Protection Officer (DPO), overseas Data Protection compliance throughout the Trust and provides independent advi ce to the Trust. The Information Governance Toolkit was replaced in April 2018 by the Data Security and Protection Toolkit (DSPT). The new toolkit was designed by NHS Digital to encompass the National Data Guardian reviews and the 10 data security standards and supports the key requirements under the General Data Protectio n Regulation (GDPR) and new Data Protection laws . The DSPT does not include levels in the same way as it did in previous years; instead it requires com pliance with 40 assertions and the entire mandatory evidence items. The Trust has provided 100% of the ma ndatory evidence items in addition to completing and meeting 40 of the 40 assertions. Information Governance training is provided as part of induction for all new staff and refresher training forms part of the Trust's mandatory training program. The Tru st continues to maintain its accreditation against the ISO27001 (2013) standard in relation to Information Security. The Trust once again received ' Substantial Assurance' from Mersey Internal Audit following a review of the new Data Security and Protection Toolkit (DSPT) evidence, making this the ninth year in succession. During the period of reporting, there have been 5 serious incidents which were reported externally to the Information Commissioner Office (ICO) using the new incident reporting tool on th e (DPST). The Trust has received notification from the ICO that 3 of the 5 incidents have been closed with no further action required by them due to the remedial action taken by the Trust. The remaining 2 are in a backlog with the ICO, however it should b e noted that there are no outstanding actions required by the Trust. Annual Quality Report The directors are required under the Health Act 2009 and the National Health Service (Quality Accounts) Regulations 2010 (as amended) to prepare Quality Accounts for each financial year. NHS Improvement (in exercise of the powers conferred on Monitor) has issued guidance to NHS foundation trust boards on the form and content of annual Quality 111 Reports which incorporate the above legal requirements in the NHS Foundation Trust Annual Reporting Manual . A number of steps have been put in place to assure the Boa rd that the quality report gives a balanced view, and that there are appropriate controls in place to ensure data quality such as: The Trust Board has a good balance of skills and knowledge to provide appropriate challenge to data. The Trust supports a col lective leadership approach which ensures a balance in the decision making process. Policies ensure that the quality of care provided is consistent and adheres to the Walton Way Values. There is a clear governance structure which facilitates the movement o f information from ward to board . Preparation of the Annual Report The Trust is the corporate trustee to The Walton Centre Charity and has assessed its relationship to the Charity as a subsidiary. The annual report has been prepared on a 'group basis' in l ine with the treatment of the final accounts. During the year, community support grew steadily and in addition to raising awareness, the Charity raised funds for specific purposes such as the Home from Home Fund to support the annual costs of the relatives ' accommodation; and the Sid Watkins Innovation Fund which enabled the Trust to purchase a Robotic Arm - a state -of-the-art piece of equipment to support a number of neurosurgical procedures. The Walton Centre Charity is overseen by the Walton Centre Chari ty Committee which is chaired by a Non -Executive Director. Details of the Walton Centre Charity Committee can be found in section 2 of the Accountability Report. Review of effectiveness As Accounting Officer, I have responsibility for reviewing the effectiveness of the system of internal control. My review of the effectiveness of the system of internal control is informed by the work of the internal auditors, clinical audit and the executive directors, senior managers and clinical leads within the Trust who have responsibility for the development and maintenance of the internal control framework. I have drawn on the content of the quality report attached to this Annual Report and other performance information available to me. 112 My review is also informed by comments made by the external auditors in their management letter and other reports. I have been advised on the implications of the result of my review of the effectiveness of the system of internal control by the board, the audit committee and a plan to address weaknesses and ensure continuous improvement of the system is in place. The Trust has a governance structure which ensures that the effectiveness of the system of internal control is fit for purpose . The Board of Directors has a clear idea of its responsibilities and the Directors have a suitable balance of knowledge, skills and experience which enables robust challenge of the systems of internal control. The Audit Committee acts independently from t he executive ensuring that stakeholders are properly protected in relation to financial reporting and internal control . The Quality Committee has continued to improve the process of internal control through the introdu ction of two initiatives; \"what qualit y means to you\" which requires divisional representatives to present to the committee on issues within their areas and presentations relating to the Darzi Principles. Both of these initiatives provide a more detailed perspective on the internal control pr ocesses to inform the committee. Furthermore MIAA reviewed the Quality Committee 's compliance with its terms of reference and noted good compliance. The Trust's internal auditors play a major part in challenging and providing assurance against the systems of internal control. Conclusion No significant internal control issues have been identified during the reporting year. Signed Hayley Citrine, Chief Executive 24 May 2019 113 4 Quality Report Please refer to the Trust's Quality Account (enclosed at the end of this report) for a detailed analysis of the following: Care Quality Commission Registration The Trust is required to register with the Care Quality Commission (CQC). Its current registration status is 'Registered without Conditions'. Quality Governance 4.1 Quality Governance The Trust developed and implemented a Quality and Patient Safety Strategy in 2015, replacing the previous Quality Governance Strategy. The Quality and Patient Safety Strategy had an overarching aim to ensure Exc ellence in Neurosciences. It buil t on previous progress through the Quality Governance Strategy and other patient safety initiatives and action plans taking the next steps for The Walton Centre a highly specialist tertiary centre going 'from good to great'. This year the Trust launched a five year strategy which was developed with staff, patients and partner organisations and is underpinned by the Walton Way Values that remain core to everything we do. The Trust's 6 ambitions are to: Deliver - best practice care Provide -more services closer to home Invest - be financially strong Lead - Research, education and innovation Adopt - advanced technology and treatments Recognise - be recognised as e xcellent in all we do In addition to this the Trust is drafting a Quality Strategy which will include both nursing and patient experience ambitions. Quality information is monitored at departmental, divisional and at board level. It includes patient safety , clinical effectiveness and patient experience information and is considered by the Quality Committee and the Board of Directors at their meetings. The Board is satisfied that, to the best of its knowledge and using its own processes and having had regard to Monitor's Quality Governance Framework, that the Trust has, and will keep in place, effective arrangements for the purpose of monitoring and continually improving the quality of healthcare provided to our patients. 114 To ensure compliance with the Care Qu ality Commission registration regulations, each regulation is part of a planned schedule of reviews which work alongside internal quality inspections . The CARES (communicate, assess, respect, experience and safety) Quality Review is an example of this . Th e review is designed around 15 standards with each standard subdivided into four categories including patient experience, observations, documentation and staff experience. This year, the Trust has continued to develop the Board Assurance Framework (BAF) an d review and refine the committee structures reporting to the Board of Directors. The Governance Department has continued to review and enhance its staffing structures with key appointments and further strengthening of health and safety and business contin uity plans within the Trust which have had external scrutiny. The Trust is committed to delivering outstanding care for patients and monitors quality and safety on a daily basis. Safety is review ed each morning at the Trust safety huddle, which allows st aff to escalate any concerns relating to patient, visitor or staff safety. Themes are shared with Trust Board quarterly. Quality and safety is discussed at various committees, which then provide chairs r eports to the appropriate committee following each m eeting . Key performance indicators are provided to committees so that improvements and key risks can be viewed and risk mitigated. Where improvements have been observed, lessons to be shared are also managed trust wide. The Quality A ccounts for 2018/19 were all achieved with the exception of 1 which was partially achieved . The Quality Accounts have been presented to the specialised commissioners and Health watch in May 2019, with positive feedback. The Patient Experience Team have been recognised by Hea lthwatch for their engagement with patients and this is noted within the Quality Account feed back. Engagement information is shared with th e Patient Experience Group and is also escalated to Trust Board with key themes of improvement work. The Board of Di rectors consulted with patients, governors, commissioners, Healthwatch and other external agencies to ascertain and agree the Trust's Quality Account improvement priorities fo r 2018/19 . The Trust continues to monitor servic es across the three domains of quality: patient safety, clinical effectiveness and patient experience, reporting progress on the improvement priorities to the Quality Committee and to the Board of Directors on a regular basis. 115 Quality priorities are monitored and performance managed by the Board of Directors and by the Quality Committee. Operational groups within the Trust are made aware of their responsibilities in relation to quality priorities and report to Board committees. The Trust's Internal Auditor, Mersey Internal Audit Agency (M IAA), are fully involved in the process to provide regular review and assurance via the Audit Committee. In addition, quarterly meetings to review quality assurance reports take place with the Trust's commissioners, ensuring external scrutiny and performa nce management. Further details with regards to the Trust's statement in relation to quality governance can be found in the Annual Gov ernance Statement included earlier in this report. Further information can also be found within the Quality Accounts section of this document. Membership At the end of March 2019 , the Trust's membership stood at 7,674 compared to 7,426 in March 2018 . The Trust's membership is available to both employees of the Trust and also patients, carers, volunteers and members of the public, aged 16 years and over, who live in the public constituencies of Cheshire, Merseyside, North Wales or the R est of England & Wales. Table 44 provides a breakdown of the Trust's membership by constituency: Table 44 Numbers by Constituency and Catchments Public Cheshire 1,172 Public Merseyside 2,515 Public North Wales 1,414 Public Rest of England and Wales 792 Public Out of Trust Area 10 Public Totals 5,903 Staff - Registered Nurse 406 Staff Registered Medical Practitioners 137 Staff Other Clinical Professional 438 116 Numbers by Constituency and Catchments Staff - Non-Clinical 346 Staff Total 1,327 TOTAL MEMBERSHIP 7,674 The Trust's Membership Strategy can be found at: www.thewaltoncentre.nhs.uk/173/being - a-member . The Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust is a public benefit organisation and its objective, with respect to membership, is to recruit, retain a nd develop a sizeable, representative and active membership which is engaged with the objectives of the Trust. Information for prospective members is posted on the Trust's website. The Trust is committed to building a membership representative of both the population it cares for and the staff who work for the Trust. Membership is therefore open to any individual who is eligible to be a member of the public or staff constituencies. During 2018/19 to ensure effective member engagement, members have continued to receive the quarterly membership newsletter Neuromatters, which contains a membership section and regular articles from Governors. These editions are sent by mail and email an d are prominently displayed around the Trust to encourage membership. The newsletter is also available on the intranet, website and via social media. During 201 8/19 the Trust and Governors undertook the following membership engagement activities: Annual M embers Meeting ; Governor take -over day on the Trusts' Twitter and Facebook social media platforms ; Articles in Neuromatters, membership magazine ; Patient engagement and listening events at Satellite Clinics ; Patient Listening Weeks ; Participation in PLACE Assessments . There is a dedicated email address which makes it simpler for members and prospective members to contact the Membership Manager: membership@thewaltoncentre.nhs.uk 4.2 Patient Experience To demonstrate our commitment to continually improving the patient experience, we have had a Patient Experience Strategy to focus on ensuring our patients remain at the centre of everything we do. This strategy has ensured that patients are i nvolved and receive an 117 experience that not only meets, but also exceeds, their physical and emotional needs and expectations. Based on feedback from patients and staff, the strategy has been used to underpin the Trust strategic aims around the Walton Way values, encompassing excellent patient experience and design actions to help the Trust achieve its strategic objective of: \"We treat our patients and colleagues with caring, respect, dignity, openness and pride. This is The Walton Way\" This has encompas sed the areas of improvement that patients have informed the Trust about, as well as being based on \"what does excellent patient experience look like?\" The purpose of this Strategy has been to: Raise standards and expectations of patient, family and care r experience at The Walton Centre Define the action required by staff throughout The Walton Centre to improve patient experience Provide a framework of action for priorities and to clarify responsibility for action Ensure the current national drivers and standards for patient experience, together with The Walton Way underpin our ambition Ensure the Patient Experience Strategy contributes effectively to the Quality Strategy and ultimately to the strategic objectives of the Trust. Further information on the progress in relation to patient experience can be found within the Quality Account section of this document. As part of the Trust's 5 year strategy (2018 -2023), the Patient Experience Strategy will be merged with the Trust Quality Strategy. Engageme nt events are going to form this new strategy. 4.3 Patient and Family Centred Care The trust has a strong focus on patient and family centred care, placing this at the heart of everything that we do, ensuring that we have the correct staffing levels to ensure our patients have the best possible experience. 4.4 Nursing Workforce The nursing workforce is reviewed on a 6-monthly basis in line with national guidance using various tools and data is triangulated with nurse sensitive indicators to ensure that staffing is appropriate and safe. The reports are presented to Quality C ommittee on a monthly basis 118 and to Board bi annually. The sen ior nursing team provide leadership across clinical areas and ensure that there is a continued focus on nursing standards, the environment, patient safety and enhanced patient and family experience. As part of their work, the team review staffing on a shif t by shift basis to ensure that changes in acuity and occupancy are considered and managed accordingly, in line with The Walton Centre outstanding status. The last staffing report was presented to the Trust Board in November 2018. As part of the staffing paper a full acuity and dependency study is undertaken on all wards and benchmarking against other trusts is also undertaken. Where staff have requested to do long days instead of single shifts, this has allowed greater flexibility with staffing numbers to support enhanced levels of care and enable staff to have an improved work -life balance. Flexible working is promoted throughout all areas in the trust. The nursing establishment planned versus actual results are revie wed by the Director of Nursing and Governance and are presented to various Committees prior to their monthly submission to NHS England and the Trust website. The unify return is cross referenced with friends and family data, registered nurse to patient ratio, nurse sensitive indicators and occupancy rates. There has been a significant focus on effective recruitment and retention of registered nurses to ensure that staffing is to its optimum. Work has been conducted alongside NHS Improvement and focussed on recruitment, support of staff i n the workplace, equality, diversity and inclusion and retention . All new registered nurses are supported with a full preceptorship programme and staff who want to retire and return are supported with this process. The trust has also taken part in the Trainee Nurse Associate programme and 4 Nursing Associates have qualified in April 2019 and are working in the numbers on the wards. 4.5 Infection Prevention The Trust has worked hard in 2018/19 to support the reductio n of healthcare acquired infections and has seen considerable reductions. The annual trajector y of Clostridium Difficile was 9 cases for Public Health England (PHE ), with the Trust reporting 8 cases this year. Clostridium difficile continues to remain a challenge for the Trust going forward however work continues to support this reduction . The Trust has also successfully managed Carbapenemase -producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) infections. The Trust screens all high risk patients on admission and undertak es regular screening in the areas containing high risk patients in the Trust. The Trust introduc ed 119 a more time ly and accurate screening medium , 'PCR' , to allow the reduction in disruption of activity and to provide a better patient experience for patients who need to be screened following contact with an infected patient or on admission. This has allowed patients to be managed more effectively throughout the hospital. The Walton Centre observed a reduction in catheter associated urinary tract infect ions (CAUTI) by introducing catheter diaries to support the clear communication of catheter management. Quality indicators are monitored via the Quality C ommittee which is chaired by a Non - Executive D irector. 4.6 Commissioning for Quality and Innovation Payment Framework (CQUIN) Commissioning for Quality and Innovation (CQUIN) was introduced in 2009. A proportion of The Walton Centre's income in 2018/19 was conditional on achieving quality improvement and innovation goals ag reed between The Walton Centre and any person or body they entered into a contract, agreement or arrangement with for the provision of relevant health services, through the Commissioning for Quality and Innovation payment framework. A proportion of the T rust's income in 2018/19 was conditional upon achieving quality improvement and innovation goals. The total payment received against th e CQUINS in 2018/19 equalled \u00a31,629, 069. For the first time CQUIN schemes were for two years with the following goals agreed for both 2017/18 and 2018/19: Clinical Utilisation Review Critical Care Timely Discharge (4 hr Target) Spinal Networks Medicines Optimisation Digital Maturity Health and Wellbeing Advice and Guidance Further details of the agreed goals for 2018/19 and for the following 12 month period are available electronically at enquiries@thewaltoncentre.nhs.uk The Quality Committee reports directly to the Board of Directors on issues of qu ality governance and risks that may affect patient experience, patient outcomes or patient safety. This Committee also has responsibility for reviewing the Trust's Quality Accounts. Review and planning events involving patients, staff, governors and Health watch identified the areas of focus in respect of quality for the forthcoming year. Key performance indicators 120 and priorities relating to quality were identified and their performance is monitored by various Committees and the Board of Directors on a month ly basis. The development of the Trust's Quality Account and reporting have also been agreed by the Board of Directors and the Trust's Council of Governors has been fully involved in the development of the Trust's quality priorities. External overview has been provided by the Trust's lead commissioner and opinion on the draft report has been sought from Healthwatch. The Overview and Scrutiny Committee, specialist commissioners and Healthwatch have had the opportunity to review the Quality Account. Patient E xperience and Complaints Handling The Patient Experience Team provides help, advice and support to patients and their families, as well as helping to resolve concerns quickly on their behalf. This can be prior to, during or after their visit to the Trust. The Patient Experience Team can be contacted in various ways including telephone, email or in person whilst in the Trust. Where concerns cannot be easily resolved or are of a more serious nature, the Patient Experience Team are responsible for suppo rting the patients and their families in managing the complaint. We pride ourselves in working with patients, families and staff throughout the Trust to resolve complaints in a timely way, explaining our actions and evidencing how services will be improve d as a result of a complaint. This was reflected in the MIAA audit complaints management conducted during 2018/19. MIAA audited the processes in line with national guidelines and established practice and rated the Trust's complaints management as 'High Assurance'. Trend Analysis and L essons Learnt Every complaint is investigated and each complainant receives a detailed response from the Chief Executive. We ensure those responses are open and transparent and provide assurance that where mistakes have been made, those are rectified and lessons learned. Outcomes from complaints are reported monthly to various committees and meetings within the Trust and to the Executive Team. Any trends are reported to the Patient Experience Group, the Board and Council of Governors. Trends and actions taken are also discussed in detail in the Governance and Risk Quarterly report, the monthly divisional governance and risk group meetings and Quality Committee. Examples of lessons learned from complaints during 2018/19 include improvements to IT systems for patients with individual needs, staff training on use of IV medication, revision of use of cannulas, improvements to the patient referral system, and personal reflection for teams and individual staff members. 121 Complaints Activity We use feedback from people who have used the complaints process to help us improve our responsiveness and service. We have developed a person centred approach so that complainants are kept involved and updated at each stage of the investigation, with regular contact from memb ers of the Patient Experience Team. Complaints received 01 April 2018 - 31 March 2019 Quarter 1 April-June 18 Quarter 2 July-Sept 18 Quarter 3 Oct- Dec 18 Quarter 4 Jan-Mar 19 Number of complaints received 21 23 24 27 The Trust received 95 complaints during 2018/19 which was 28% less than the 132 complaints received during 2017/18. A key element of the person centred approach is focusing on the individual outcomes patients and families are seeking when they raise concerns. The Patient Experience Team make contact with the patient or family member once a complaint is received to agree the best way of addressing their concerns. This individualised approach has led to many patients or family members wishing to resolve their concerns informally rather than pursuing the formal complaints procedure. In addition to resolving complaints, where improvements can be made that are irrelevant to the complaint but noted in the investigation, these too are taken forward. Patient Experience Strategy an d Patient and Pub lic Engagement There has been significant engagement during 2018/19 with patients, families, staff and external stakeholders reviewing how we can enhance, capture and act upon feedback. This work has been monitored through the Trust's Patient Experience Gr oup. Building on previous engagement work at the Trust, including the Neuro Network Vanguard programme, we have improved how we listen and act upon patient, family and carer feedback through: Developing the Neuro Buddy volunteer service to capture feedbac k from patients while providing support Holding engagement events at the Brain Charity Holding Healthwatch Listening events in outpatient departments and on inpatient wards 122 Working with universities to analyse best practice in patient and family engagement and involvement Engagement events led by clinicians Triangulating patient and family feedback with other quality indicators (such as incidents, complaints, claims, compliments) in Trust governance reports and governance assurance framework. This has informed the Trust's forward plans for engaging and involving patients and families during 2019/20. Engagement events are planned at various locations as part of the implementation of Patient and Family Centred Care, which will also include use of soc ial media during engagement events for patients and families who cannot attend can participate real time during the event. Volunteers During 2018/19 , the volunteer service has continued to grow at the Trust. At the end of Quarter 4, we ha d 78 volunteers contributing over 750 hours per month on average. All volunteers have attended induction and required mandatory training. In addition to the Neuro Buddy role providing support to patients on wards , volunteers have been providing a valuable service in roles relating to research, Meet and Greet, trolley service, befriending, infection prevention and control, administrative duties and assisting the Pain Management Programme. There has been a focus during 2018/19 on recruiting younger volunteers (aged 16 -18). Our volunteer coordinator has held education and recruitment sessions at local colleges, with extremely positive feedback. Due to the nature of volunteering, there is a high turnover of volunteers (eg students ending term) with 58 volunteers leaving during 2018. Close management of this turnover helps us to ensure that we have a high level of volunteers who are appropriately supported. National Inpatient Survey In 2018 due to an informatics error by the Trusts survey provider (Picker) this led to a reduction in the return rate and the statistical significance of the rate to not meet CQC requirements, therefore the inpatient survey results can only be compared with other picker hospitals surveyed and not published as part of the wider CQC nat ional inpatient survey results. 123 The results still included feedback from 29% of our inpatients and highlight ed that significant improvements had been made across the hospital resulting in: We were the most improved Trust out of the 77 Picker organisations compared to last year Our scores were significantly better than last year in 16 questions (there were no questions last year where we were significantly better than the previous year) There were no questions where we were significantly worse than last year (we were significantly worse on 11 questions in the last survey compared to the previous year) We were significantly better than the Picker average on 37 questions (this was only 26 last year) There were no questions where we were significantly worse than the Picker average (there were 4 questions last year where we were significantly worse than the Picker average) The Walton Centre undertakes regular patient and family engagement through several methods and this will be continued over the next twelve mon ths to ensure that we act on relevant, current feedback National Inpatient Survey Question 2014 Result 2015 Result 2016 Result 2017 Result 2017 National Comparison 1.

The Neuroscience Research Centre (NRC) aims to : Work collaboratively to facilitate high quality clinical and healthcare research; Support the development and adoption of innovation; Reduce the timeline for study set up ; Ensure its quality management system s and processes are fit for purpose and compliant with statutory regulations; Align its functions to Walton Way values and behaviours . The NRC continues to work with clinicians to embed the Trust's Research, Development and Innovation Strategy so that research and innovatio n are integral to the Trust's day -to-day activities, making research and innovation everyone's business. The NRC has recruit ed 1,039 patients in 2017/ 2018. There a re currently 85 clinical studies on-going at The Walton Centre and participation in clinical research demonstrates the Trust's commitment to improving the quality of care. The Trust continues to recruit patients and relatives to the Genome Medicine Centre in Liverpool, which is part of the Government's flagship 100, 000 Genome Project. During 2018/19, the Trust has worked in partnership with the following networks and organisations to attract NIHR funding to deliver clinical research and share research outputs and innovations to inform service transformation and impr ovement: Clinical Research Network: North West Coast (CRN) Liverpool Health Partners (LHP) The Innovation Agency, the North West Coast Academic Health Science Network, (NWC AHSN) North West Coast Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care (NWC CLAHRC) Local Universities Other NHS trusts and NHS organisations Pharmaceutical companies (industry) The Trust was shortlisted in four categories in the North West Research & Innovation Awards for 2018 and won the Clinical Research Rising Star o f the Year award. 125 Clinical Audit During 201 8/19, nine national audits and one confidential enquiry covered NHS services provided by the Trust. National Audits Adult Critical Care (ICNARC / Case Mix programme) The case mix programme is an audit of patient outcomes from adult critical care units. Data is collected on all patients admitted to Horsley Intensive Care Unit and submitted securely. The data sent is compared with outcomes from similar patients and analysed. The Trust receives quarterly data ana lysis reports which identify trends over time and shows how it compares to other units. Thes e reports are discussed at the ICNARC Review Group Meetings and aim to assist with decision -making, resource allocation and local quality improvement. An audit of unplanned re -admissions within 48 hours is currently being undertaken with the aim to present findings in May 2019. Trauma Audit and Research Network (TARN) TARN audits the pathway and outcomes of patients admitted to the Trust as a result of a traumatic i njury. Data collected for patients admitted is submitted securely and clinical reports are published by TARN three times a year specifically focusing on head and spinal injuries, orthopaedic injuries and thoracic and a bdominal injuries. These reports alon g with monthly performance and activity reports are discussed at the quarterly internal trauma services meeting and the monthly Aintree University Hospital / Walton Major Trauma Clinical Assurance meeting. They are also discussed at the Major Trauma Centre Collaborative Board (MTCC). TARN, since October 2014, are working alongside Quality Health to collect Major Trauma Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs), measures are collected before the patient's discharge and TARN follow up 6 months post injury. PROMs performance reports are published quarterly and are fed back in the quarterly internal trauma services meeting , any patients experiencing severe -extreme problems 6 months from injury are discussed in the trauma -rehab MDT to see what further care can be provided. The provision of this accurate and relevant information is vital to help doctors, nurses and managers improve their services. The Trust will continue to submit data to TARN and will review individual cases as appropriate . The current TARN webs ite indicates that the Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust is one of the five Major Trauma Centres in England that has a statistically significant number of excess survivors compared to the average. 126 Falls and Fragility Fractures Audit Programme - Nation al Audit of Inpatient Falls This audit is funded through the Healthcare Quality Improvement Partnership (HQIP) and is carried out by the Clinical Effectiveness and Evaluation Unit (CEEU) of the Royal College of Physicians. The Falls Workstream is currently contracted to deliver the National Audit of Inpatient Falls (NAIF), a clinically led, web -based audit of inpatient falls prevention care in acute hospitals in England and Wales. NAIF aims to improve inpatient falls prevention through aud it and quality im provement. The plan is for this to become an on -going audit with continuous data collection from 2019. WCFT did not submit data for the 2018 dat a collection period as there were no cases that met the criteria. National Emergency Laparotomy Audit NELA is being carried out by the National Institute of Academic Anaesthesia's Health Services Research Centre (HSRC) on behalf of the Royal College of Anaesthetists (RCoA), The audit aims to enable improvement of the quality of care for patients undergoing emergen cy laparotomy. The Trust does not perform many of these procedures but it continues to submit data for the cases it does have securely. The Trust submitted 100% of the applicable cases in the data collection period. NHS England has published documents indicating plans fo r an Emergency Laparotomy Best Practice Ta riff in 2019/20 . Commissioners are likely to consider the case ascertainment rates as reported by NELA before approving payment of the BPT. For instance, even if NELA data shows 80% of patients received the correct care, commissioners may not pay the enhanced BPT if only 30% of cases have been submitted to NELA. Specialist Rehabilitation for Patients with Complex Needs Following Major Injury The audit will provide a national comparative assessme nt of the organisation, quality, outcomes and efficacy of specialist rehabilitation services provided for adults with complex needs following major injury (physical injury caused by events such as road traffic accidents, falls, etc .) It aims to drive improved and equitable access to specialist rehabilitation services. Walton Centre NH S Foundation Trust submitted data securely via the TARN database. Findings are discussed at regional and local trauma group meetings. This project closed in June 2018. The Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme (SSNAP) The clinical audit collects a minimum data set for stroke patients in England, Wales and Northern Ireland in every acute hospital, and follows the pathway through recovery, rehabilitat ion, and outcomes at the point of 6 month assessment. Originally The Walton 127 Centre NHS Foundation Trust was not required to submit data to this audit, however, following changes made to include thrombectomy data the Trust has started to submit information for the patients who have had a thrombectomy procedure at The Walton Centre . Data collection is on -going and the audit resu lts are published quarterly. An audit of WCFT thrombectomy data is currently being undertaken. National Comparative Audit of Blood Transfusion (NCABT) The National Comparative Audit of Blood Transfusion is a programme of clinical audits which looks at the use and administration of blood components in NHS and independent hospitals in England and North Wales. Schedule of audits 201 8:- 1. Audit of FFP cryoprecipitate in children and neonates - not applicable to WCFT 2. Audit of massive haemorrhage - WCFT did not have the minimum number of cases needed to be eligible to participate 3. Audit of O negative - not applicable to WCFT 4. Vein to Vein au dit - voluntary audit, not applicable to WCFT National Neurosurgery Audit Programme (NNAP) The Neurosurgical National Audit Programme (NNAP) was established by the Society of British Neurological Surgeons in 2013 as part of a major quality improvement ini tiative. The programme aims to support neurosurgical units in the UK and Ireland to improve patient care, outcomes, safety, and experience by providing high quality, robust audit data that is analysed and presented in a consistent and clinically relevant way. National Audit of Care at the End of Life (NACEL) NACEL is commissioned by the Healthcare Quality Improvement Partnership (HQIP) as part of the National Clinic al Audit and Patient Outcome Programme (NCAPOP). It focuses on the quality and outcomes of care experienced by those in their last admission in acute, community and mental health hospitals throughout En gland and Wales. NACEL will also focus on progress against achieving the five Priorities for Care as outlined in 'One Chance to Get it Right' , on progress against the NICE Quality Standards, and CQC domains. The scope of the NACEL includes the following elements: A case note review of inpatients in hospital in the last few days and hours of life An organisational level audit covering service mo dels, activity, workforce, finance quality and outcomes The development and administration of an innovative Carer Reported Experience Measure 128 The development and administration of a Staff Reported Measure Topics for periodic, time -limited 'spotlight' audit s The Walton Centre submitted data to the National Audit; however it was agreed not to submit the carer audit for bereaved relatives this year. The published report is being reviewed collaboratively with the palliative care team at Aintree Hospital who provide our specialist palliative care service. This is being monitored by the EOLC Committee. National Confidential Enquiries (NCEPOD) The purpose of NCEPOD (National Confidential Enquiry into Patient Outcome and Death) is to assist in maintaining and im proving standards of medical and surgical care for the benefit of the public by reviewing the management of patients. This involves undertaking confidential surveys and research and by publishing and generally making available the results of such activitie s, in order to maintain and improve quality of pati ent outcomes. There was one study The Walton Centre was eligible to participate i n during 201 8/19. Pulmonary embolism (PE) The aim of this study is to examine organisational structures, processes, protocols and care pathways in hospitals from pre -admission through to discharge or death and identify avoidable and remediable factors in the management of patients diagnosed with pulmonary embolism focusing on the following areas of care: Risk assessment and prevention of venous thrombo -embolism Gap between those risk assessed to need anticoagulation, and those who actually receive it Availability and quality of diagnostic assessment, particularly CT scan of lungs (CTPA) 24/7 Risk stratification and treat ment of PE with the appropriate selection for, and application of, ambulatory and in hospital care Management, follow up and care, including information sharing on future complications Identification and management of patients at high risk of death, compli cations and late morbidity (eg. secondary pulmonary hypertension) and recurrence. Assessment of possible unnecessary interventions, including temporary IVC filters Progress update - The patient identifier spreadsheet has been completed and submitted to NCE POD within the set timeframe. One Walton Centre case was selected for the study however this was later excluded as the procedure date did not meet the criteria. The Trust 129 will complete the organisational questionnaire when this is distri buted . The report is scheduled for publication in summer 2019. Local Audits During 201 8/19, the Trust also participated in 102 local clinical audits. All action plans received are discussed, monitored and signed off by the Clinical Audit Group. The Clinical Audit Teams for each Division produce a monthly clinical audit activity status report which includes recommended actions f rom all completed projects for each division and the progress made towards implementation. These reports and actions are monitored monthly at the Divisional Governance and Risk meetings. An annual clinical audit event is also held at the Trust for staff t o share their work and learning from audits undertaken for the purpose of service improvement and improving clinical knowledge. Never Events During 2018/19 the Trust reported 2 Never Events. The requirements of the Duty of Candour regulations were followed in all instances ensuring openness and transparency. The first incident was subject to a thorough investigation with root cause analysis being completed; lessons learnt were shared within t he divisions. The second never event is currently being investigated. Conclusion The Trust had made con tinuous improvements during 2018/1 9, meeting all of its financial and operational targets. This was a significant achievement, given the ongoing challenges faced by the NHS. The Chair and Chief Executive paid tribute to the hard work , dedication and achievements of staff and the many supporters of the Trust, including volunteers, support groups, charitable groups, fundraisers, members, governors a nd current and previous patients. 130 Quality Account 2018 - 2019 131 Part 1 Statement on Quality from the Chief Executive Part 2 Priorities for improvement and Statements of Assurance from the Board Improvement Priorities 2.1 How well have we done in 2018 -19? 2.1.1 Patient Safety 2.1.2 Clinical Effectiveness 2.1.3 Patient Experience 2.2 What are our priorities for 2019 -20? 2.2.1 Patient Safety 2.2.2 Clinical Effectiveness 2.2.3 Patient Experience 2.3 Statements of Assurance from the Board 2.3.1 Data Quality 2.3.2 Participation in Clinical Audit and National Confidential Enquiries 2.3.3 National Audits 2.3.4 National Confidential Enquiries 2.3.5 Participation in Local Clinical Audits 2.3.6 Participation in Clinical Research and Development 2.3.7 CQUIN Framework & Performa nce 2.3.8 Care Quality Commission (CQC) Registration 2.3.9 Trust Data Quality 2.3.10 Learning from Deaths 2.3.11 Progress in Implementing Clinical Standards for Seven Day Hospital Services 2.3.12 Speaking Up Part 3 Trust Overview of Quality 2018/19 3.1 Complaints 3.2 Local Engagement - Quality Account 3.3 Quality Governance 3.4 Hackathon 3.5 Hayley's Huddle 132 3.6 Cultural Ambassadors Programme 3.7 Anaesthesia Clinical Services Accreditation (ACSA) 3.8 Epilepsy Action Award 3.9 Animal Therapy 3.10 BBC Two Hospital Episode 3.11 Consultant becomes Eurospine pres ident 3.12 Walton Surgical Assistant training introduced 3.13 Navajo accreditation 3.14 Consultant wins Outstanding Health Professional Award 3.15 CPMP service in Warrington 3.16 Walton Six Steps 3.17 Overview of Performance in 2018/19 against National Priorities from the Department of Health's Operating Framework 3.18 Overview of Performance in 2018/19 against NHS Outcomes Framework 3.19 Indicators Annex 1 Statements from Commissioners and Local Healthwatch Organisations Annex 2 Statement of Directors' responsibilities for the Quality Report Glossary of Terms 133 Part 1 Statement on Quality from the Chief Executive We are delighted to share the Quality Account 2018/2019 for The Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust which demonstrates our continual drive and commitment to delivering excellent standards of quality care to our patients and their families, enabling, \"Excellence in Neuroscience\". This report details our performance over the last year whilst also highlighting our key priorities for 2019 / 2020. 2018/2019 has been an exciting time for the Trust and we have undertaken significant engagement to identify a new Trust strategy and objectives. We continued to engage with our partners and stakeholders in 2018 / 2019 and to identify our priorities for the fo re-coming year with the Council of Governors, patient representatives, specialist commissioning and members of Healthwatch. The Quality Account incorporates information relating to compliance with national audits, complaints and information relating to res earch governance and data quality. The Trust continues to deliver on quality care in relation to patient safety, clinical effectiveness and patient experience and our vision encapsulates this with our drive to achieve patient and family centred care. The E xecutive Team are committed to leading change to ensure patients have outstanding care both within the Walton Centre and in the other hospitals and centres across Cheshire and Mersey where we deliver care. The Trust has a robust performance management fr amework, developed with Commissioners and with the Welsh Health Specialised Services Committee. NHS England (Cheshire and Merseyside) as specialist commissioner undertakes the lead in performance managing the Trust against its statutory and NHS plan target s as part of the local health economy review process and regular contract quality performance meetings have taken place. The Walton Centre NHS FT achieved a CQC rating of Outstanding in April 2016. The Trust has continued to deliver quality care and are cu rrently finalising their well led inspection by the CQC. The quality priorities for 2018 /2019 have been achieved and are detailed within this Quality Account. In addition, this year we have achieved: Introduction of Hayley's Huddle and the Safety Huddle Introduced the Cultural Ambassadors Programme -Andrew Lynch The Anaesthesia Clinical Services Accreditation Introduced Animal Therapy Patient Ambassador shortlisted for BBC The One Show's NHS Unsung hero award Taken part in the BBC Two Hospital episode 134 Designated a Hyper Acute Stroke Research Centre Accreditation Infection Prevention and Control Team member named NHS Procurement Champion NHS in the North Excellence in Supply Awards Specialist Spinal Surgeon became Eurospine president Creation of the Wal ton Surgical Assistant Shortlisted for the Nursing Times Workforce 'Best Place to Work for Employee Satisfaction' Award Navajo accreditation Consultant Neurologist wins Outstanding Health Professional - Brain Charity Awards Achieved IIP Gold Award for a second time Such quality initiatives are discussed and debated through various Committees, including, the Audit Committee, the Quality Committee, Business and Performance Committee in order to ensure that quality assurance is achieved. These Committees report to Trust Board to ensure that patient safety is a priority and is progressed. The sub groups to the Quality Committee include the Patient Safety Group, Clinical Effectiveness and Service Group, Infection Prevention and Control Committee and Patient Experience Gro up and items are discussed in detail to gain assurance and enable lessons to be identified and shared Trust -wide. The Professional Nurses Forum, Quality Committee and Trust Board all receive information related to the quality agenda and progress of each indicator is assessed and rated as Red, Amber or Green against expected performance levels. A Trust safety huddle was in place for 2018 and this supported the discussions between various staff groups each day to share learning and prevent harm to patients , visitors and staff. Staff within The Walton Centre NHS FT have continued to deliver year on year improvements in care and this is recognised by their achievements of 2018 / 2019 whilst working in partnership with our patients and their families to meet and exceed their expectations. The commitment to patient safety, clinical effectiveness and patient experience is appreciated and has enabled our successes. 135 In detailing our achievements and forthcoming priorities, I confirm that the information provided in this quality account is accurate and to the best of my knowledge. Hayley Citrine, Chief Executive 24 May 2019 136 Part 2 Priorities for Improvement and Statements of Assurance from the Board Towards the end of each financial year, the Trust works closely with various stakeholders to identify areas of focus for improvement for the forthcoming year. At this time it also allows the Trust to reflect on the year's previous performance against the i dentified quality improvement priorities. The delivery of the quality improvement priorities are monitored through meetings of the Quality Committee, chaired by a Non -Executive Director, with sub groups focussing on the 3 domains of quality: patient safe ty, clinical effectiveness and patient experience. The Director of Nursing and Governance is the Executive Lead responsible for delivering the plan and designates duties to operational leads for each of the priorities. All of the priorities were identifi ed following a review by Trust Board on the domains of quality reported in 2017/18. Consultation with patients, governors, commissioners, Healthwatch and other external agencies also informed the Board when focusing our priorities for 2018/19. The Trust is committed to embracing improvement across a wide range of issues to achieve excellence in all areas of care. The following section includes a report on progress against the three improvement priority areas for 2018/19. 137 2.1 Update for Improvement Prior ities for 2018 -2019 In February 2019, the Board of Directors undertook a full review of quality priorities used by the Trust for the previous financial year and acknowledged the work implemented to ensure each priority was on target. At this review, quality priorities were identified and agreed for 2019/20. The improvement priorities all contained specific indicators which have been monitored over the last twelve months to provide evidence of sustainable improvement. Performance has been managed through subcommittees to Trust Board. Operational groups within the Trust have been responsible for the implementation of the quality priorities and reporting to committees as required. Merseyside Internal Audit Agency (MIAA) has been fully engaged in the Trust during 2018/19, providing regular reviews and assurance via the Audit Committee and this process will continue into 2019/20. Bi -monthly quality meetings to review quality assurance reports have taken place with the commissioners, ensuring external scrutiny and performance management. 2.1.1 Patient Safety Priority 1: Reduce Falls There is a genuine desire to reduce falls and introduce a post -falls questionnair e to measure the psychological e ffect on patients. Whilst falls can have a physical harm, psychological elements can also be affe cted. Falls with no harm can affect patient confidence. Outcome: Achieved The Trust has implemented a post fall questionnaire which enables staff to have a more informed conversation with patients about their experiences following a fall. By asking patien ts to discuss what caused the fall or the circumstances leading up to it; future falls may be prevented. Falls can affect the confidence of the patient and thus impact on daily activities or rehabilitation; leading to an extended hospital stay. From the qu estionnaire, patients have reported feeling nervous, anxious and a little shocked post fall but that it also made them realise that they need to ask for help rather than try and be independent too early. Feedback collated will be incorporated in the revise d patient information leaflet for falls. 138 Priority 2: Invest in staff training for patients with challenging behaviour Extensive work has been undertaken to support patients with challenging behaviour. Staff have highlighted that they frequently experience abuse, both verbally and physically from patients and their families which is also highlighted in the staff survey. Outcome: Achieved In April 2018 the Trust approved a business case for the appointment of a Personal Safety Trainer on a part time basis. This replaced the previous arrangements of an external training provider delivering training to all relevant staff as required. Since April 2018, the training has been reviewed and updated. To ensure staff are receiving relevant and up to date techniques. The Personal Safety Trainer has attended a National course in order to deliver practical training to staff and this is in collaboration with the moving and handing advisor for the Trust. As well as developing and delivering the new training package, the personal safety trainer attends wards/departments following incidents of aggression, to support staff real -time and help ensure there are appropriate plans in place to manage these difficult situations. Priority 3: Reduce missed doses of cri tical medication year on year The Trust has a list of medicines that are classed as critical that must be given when prescribed to maintain safe and effective care. On occasions critical medicines are omitted for a variety of reasons and in some cases th is is avoidable. Outcome: Achieved During 18/19 the Trust achieved an overall reduction of missed doses of critical medications. Since quarter 3 17/18 the missed doses of critical medicines have been audited which is undertaken for one week each month. During 17/18 the mean number of misse d doses per quarter was 107.5. In 18/19 this reduced to 68.5 which is a 36% reduction. Audits continue in 19/20 and now include consideration of whether appropriate action was taken when doses could not be given, for example considering an alternative o r informing the medical team. 2.1.2 Clinical Effectiveness Priority 1: Extend Health and Wellbeing Programme to improve staff resilience and mindfulness As an organisation with Investors in People Gold we are committed to ensuring the psycho logical wellbeing of our staff. As the pressure within the NHS increases, it is essential that our staff are able to manage their wellbeing whilst maintaining good health. 139 Outcome: Achieved Approximately 10% of the workforce have been trained in resilien ce techniques. Research is underway to evaluate the benefits locally so this may be shared with other organisations. The final report date is March 2020. Priority 2: Reduce non -clinical cancelled operations year on year It is the aim of the Trust to reduce non -clinical cancellations year on year as cancellations have a negative effect of patient experience. Outcome: Achieved There has been a 7.14% reduction in the number of non -clinical cancelled operations during 2018 /19 (156) when compared with 2017/18 (168). Priority 3: Safety Huddle The safety huddle addresses issues which have occurred over the past 24 hours and gives an opportunity to raise potential safety issues for the forthcoming 24 hour period, related to patients, visitors and staff. Outcome: Achieved The Safety Huddle take s place daily with staff attending from all disciplines. Themes are identified and quarterly reports are presented to the Quality Committee. The Trust has a culture of continuous improvement and this has resulted in improved communication and lessons lea rned to be shared quickly to prevent further harm. 2.1.3 Patient Experience Priority 1: Improve how we provide information to patients Patients and families are increasingly using social media as a key source of information to find out about their condition and their care and providing feedback and opinion. Outcome: Achieved There has been a significant increase in social media followers on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram during 2018/19. The increase in followers (16,303) has been positively affec ted by videos of patient stories and national TV coverage including the BBC 'Hospital Show' and 'One Show'. 140 The significant increase in followers has enhanced our opportunities for sharing information with patients and capturing their feedback. Social m edia has been used to share key information with patients and families such as urgent notices about outpatient appointments and car park availability, organ donation, engagement about the Trust Strategy and Vision, and infection control precautions. A proc ess has been implemented so that feedback on social media is recorded and acted upon by the Patient Experience Team. This has led to a significant increase in the number of compliments from patients and families, with positive feedback from staff about how this has enhanced their morale. Priority 2: Initiate enhanced training on oral hygiene As a specialised centre for neurology and neurosurgery, we care for patients who have various complex conditions. As a result of some of these conditions, many pa tients require ventilation (sometimes for prolonged periods of time), a tracheostomy and/or have dysphagia (difficulty in swallowing) which at times means a patient has to remain nil by mouth for a period of time. These patients are particularly vulnerable to having poor oral hygiene due to changes in secretions, dry mouth and impaired swallow. As well as this, many of our patients have cognitive and mobility difficulties, meaning it is difficult for them to care fo r their mouths efficiently resulting in decreased comfort levels as well as placing such patients at increased risk of infections and malnutrition. Outcome: Achieved The six month audit has been completed showing that over 100 members of staff have been trained in how to assess and care for patients mouths appropriately. The audit also showed an increase in an assessment of mouth status of 21%, an increase of 15% in mouth care products being given appropriately and 93% of patients audited having document ed mouth care in the past 24 hours. Paperwork has been finalised and is being used in a paper format currently across the wards with steps taken to make this available via EP2. Training is being rolled out across the Trust with mouth care champions ident ified for each ward. The champions continue targeted training to staff commencing employment at The Walton Centre as well as providing additional support where mouth care is proving especially challenging. Training has also been incorporated into the tr acheostomy training, nurse preceptorship and HCA certificate programmes. 141 Priority 3: Improve the way we listen and act on patient, family and carer feedback Patient, family and carer feedback is important to us and it is essential that we triangulate information received and use all information gathered. Outcome: Achieved There has been significant engagement during 2018/19 with patients, families, staff and external stakeholders reviewing how we can enhance, capture and act upon feedback. This work has been monitored through the Trust's Patient Experience Group. Building on previous engagement work at the Trust, including the Neuro Network Vanguard programme, we have improved how we listen and act upon patient, family and carer feedback through: Developing the Neuro Buddy volunteer service to capture feedback from patients while providing support Holding engagement events at the Brain Charity Holding Healthwatch Listening events in outpatient departments and inpatient wards Working with universities to analyse best practice in patient and family engagement and involvement Engagement events led by clinicians Triangulating patient and family feedback with other quality indicators (such as incidents, complaints, claims, compliments) in Trust governance reports and governance assurance framework. This has informed the Trust's forward plans for engaging and involving patients and families during 2019/20. Engagement events are planned at various locations as part of the implementation of Patient and Family Centred Care, which will also include use of social media during engagement events for patients and families who cannot attend can participate real time during the event. 142 2.2 What are our priorities for 2019 - 2020? In December 201 8, the Board of Governors undertook a full review of quality priorities used by the Trust for the previous financial year and acknowledged the work implemented to ensure each indicator was successfully implemented and monitored. After this review, quality priorities were identified and agreed for 2019/20 with the Quality Committee, Health watch and Specialist Commissioners identifying the final priorities from those initially identified. How progress to achieve these priorities will be monitored and mea sured: Each of the priorities has identified lead/s who has agreed milestones throughout the year. Monthly meetings are held to review progress and support given as required. How progress to achieve these priorities will be reported: Updates are presented to the Quality Committee and Patient Experience Group which report to Trust Board. Merseyside Internal Audit Agency (MIAA) will be fully involved providing regular reviews and assurance via the Audit Committee. Quarterly quality meetings are he ld with the commissioners to review quality assurance and provide external scrutiny and performance management. 2.2.1 Patient Safety Priority 1: Support Religious beliefs and cultures within the Theatre Department Reason for Prioritising : Whilst a lot of work has been undertaken for Equality, Diversity and Inclusion it has become apparent further work is required regarding cultural and religious beliefs. The aim is to provide patients with an information leaflet regarding the products used within the theatre environment, for specific cultures, such as Jehovah Witnesses, to support patient religion / choice. Outcome Required: Training will be provided to staff within the Theatre and Outpatient Departments and will be audited. All patients who are Jehovah Witnesses will receive a leaflet, will have a pre - operative discussion and checklist completed regarding blood components. 143 Priority 2: Implement Aseptic Non Touch Technique Reason for Prioritising : An aseptic technique is used to de liver a wide range of care interventions to patient's e.g. intravenous medicines/fluids and wound care. Ineffective standards of aseptic technique are a significant cause of healthcare associated infection. Aseptic Non Touch Technique (ANTT) is a recogni sed national standard that has been shown to support the reduction of healthcare associated infections. Whilst there has been lots of work undertaken in respect of infection control, the introduction of ANTT will enhance infection prevention practice; improve safety and quality of care for patients. Outcome Required: To reduce variability in clinical pract ice and increase compliance with infection and reduce the risk of healthcare associated infection. Priority 3: Pre and post -operative discussions with the Theatre Team Reason for Prioritising : Whilst conversations take place during pre -operative a ssessments, patients often have further questions/anxieties regarding their forthcoming admission that may not necessarily be a clinical related question and may be related to the 'experience' of the day itself and the expectations of being in theatre. Thi s priority is following feedback from the inpatient questionnaire in conjunction with the Head of Patient Experience. The conversation will take place on the day of surgery, before the patient's procedure, and is separate to pre -operative assessments (whi ch will take place prior to the admission). This will be part of a bespoke theatre patient experience proforma. This conversation will enable recovery staff to gain an understanding of the emotions, expectations and wellbeing of patients at that point, as we do not currently capture this additional information. The patient's journey will be followed to ensure we gather feedback regarding their experience to ensure we get a better understanding of the patient journey. With the introduction of a pre and post-operative discussion with a member of the theatre team, we aim to ensure future patients have a positive and safe experience and an opportunity to ask questions they may not feel there is a place for in other appointments they may attend. 144 Outcome Required: This initiative will address the normal anxieties that a lot of patients feel in relation to being admitted to theatre and hope to improve the patients experience by doing so. In doing this we have purposefully avoided issues surrounding consent and clinical outcomes as they are addressed in other pre -established conversations and documents that will not be included in this initiative. We will signpost the patient to the relevant persons should these questions arise. The outcome sought is to addr ess the emotional and welfare needs around a patient's admission to theatre and therefore be a more holistic approach to our communication and care planning. 2.2.2 Clinical Effectiveness Priority 1: Introduce In -house Masters Neurosciences Training Modul e Reason for Prioritising : This is a level 7 Masters module that will provide an overview of the neuroscience speciality. It will be available to the multi -disciplinary team (MDT) to enhance staff knowledge of care and management of patients within the neuroscience specialty. Outcome Required: To gain accreditation for the module by an academic provider and to deliver a Neurosciences module to a range of MDT staff across the Trust Priority 2: Contacting patients who require telemetry tests prior to admission to reduce the rate of DNAs (appointments where patients do not attend) Reason for Prioritising : EEG Telemetry is a type of long term EEG monitoring to aid the diagnosis of epilepsy. Telemetry tests require a hospital admission and during this time the patients is confined to bed (whilst their brain activity is monitored together with a video recording of the patient). Demand for this test is significantly high and waiting times can be long. Patients referred for telemetry will be contacted to obtain a detailed clinical history. This will ensure the telemetry test is still warranted and the patient understands what the admission involves. 145 Patients can be on t he waiting list for many months. Two weeks prior to admission the patient will be contacted again to ensure their seizure frequency has not changed/or seizure type changed. If it has changed then tests may no longer be required and the appointment can be re-allocated. Outcome Required: Reduction in patients admitted for telemetry who are no longer having frequent seizures Reduction in DNAs Priority 3: Introduce the A3 methodology for Quality Improvement Reason for Prioritising : Whilst the Trust un dertakes numerous projects to enhance patient care, the A3 Methodology supports a 'plan on a page' concept which will provide staff with a project plan to deliver clear defined outcomes Staff will have a streamlined approach to project delivery, saving va luable time and enabling success Outcome Required: Training will be delivered to 75 leaders Trust wide. Quality Improvement Walls will be in place in order for learning to be displayed and shared A3 posters will be discussed with the Executive Team to provide support and challenge in progressing change 2.2.3 Patient Experience Priority 1: Introduce Patient and Family Centred Champions Reason for Prioritising : A scoping exercise will be undertaken to identify staff who would like to become a champion for patient and family centred care The role will involve supporting patients throughout their journey by way of undertaking shadowing, walkabout exercises and obtaining patient and family stories This will enable the Trust to ensure patients an d families have the best possible experience Outcome Required: For patients and families to receive the best possible care at The Walton Centre Staff satisfaction 146 A wider allocation of resources Better Health Outcomes Priority 2: Offer neurovascular follow up patients the opportunity to receive scan results via post Reason for Prioritising : These patients routinely have scans at 6 months, 18 months and 60 months post treatment. They often attend clinic simply to be told things are fine. At a patient's 6 month clinic appointment they will be offered the opportunity to receive the results of their scan via letter. If there is an issue with the scan they will be given a clinic appointment. This will result in improved patient experience as no travel will be required and no expenses (as per previous feedback) whilst releasing further car spaces for others. It should also free up some capacity within the outpatient department and reduce waiting times for appo intments within the neurovascular service. Outcome Required: Patients who attend the neurovascular follow -up clinic will be offered the opportunity to receive their follow -up scan results via post if clinically appropriate. Letters will be sent with imagi ng results which will decrease the waiting list for follow -up appointments within the neurovascular service. Priority 3: Refurbishing of Patient and Family Day Rooms within the ward areas Reason for Prioritising : The day rooms within the surgical wards will be refurbished into a patient and family centred environment which will support the healing process for patients and enable families to spend quality time with their loved ones The rooms will be equipped with a small kitchenette, dining area an d comfortable seating Outcome Required: For patients and families to have a more patient and family centred environment and spend more time with their loved ones. The day rooms will be refurbished and redecorated with facilities to enable patients and fam ilies to enjoy a meal together, watch TV together and also be able to make beverages whilst sitting in comfortable supported chairs. 147 2.3 Statements of Assurance from the Board During 2018/19, The Walton Centre provided and/or sub -contracted four r elevant health services: neurology neurosurgery pain management rehabilitation The Walton Centre has reviewed all the data available to them on the quality of care in four of these relevant health services. We have interpreted this as services covered by our Quality Committee that are monitored by internal and external indicators and not necessarily a formal review. The income generated by the relevant health services reviewed in 2018/19 represents 91.1% of the total income generated from the provision of the relevant health services by The Walton Centre for 2018/19. 2.3.1 Data Quality The data reviewed covers three dimensions of quality - patient safety, clinical effectiveness and patient experience which are all encompassed within the Quality Com mittee Terms of Reference and Trust Board. The Walton Centre takes the following actions to improve data quality: The Trust continues to develop internal data collection systems t o provide assurance to the Quality Committee in relation to the accuracy of data quality. The Trust continuously reviews its internal processes in relation to the measurement and reporting of the quality indicators reported both to the Board and reported externally. This includes reviewing the quality indicators outlined with in the Quality Accounts ensuring that there are standard operating procedures and data quality checks within each quality indicator process. Ward to Board nursing quality indicator data has been collated over the last eight years which includes data coll ection of not only information to support progress against the Quality Accounts but additional nursing metrics to provide internal assurance and allow a clear focus for improving patient experience and delivery of quality care. This information supports the Trust in building year on year metrics to show progress against important aspects of the patient journey. 148 2.3.2 Participation in Clinical Audit and National Confidential Enquiries During 2018/2019, 10 national clinical audits and 2 national confidential enquires covered relevant health services that The Walton Centre provides.

If implementation is not deemed appropriate then outstanding actions are placed on the divisional risk registers. Recommended actions resulting from clinical audit projects are reviewed and monitored monthly by the Clinical Audit Group. The divisional clinical audit teams produce a monthly clinical audit activity progress report which includes registered audits, reco mmended actions from all completed projects for each division and the progress made towards implementation, these reports are discussed at the relevant Divisional Governance & Risk Group monthly meetings. 2.3.6 Participation in Clinical Research and Deve lopment The number of patients receiving relevant health services provided or sub -contracted by The Walton Centre in 2018/19 that were recruited during that period to participate in research approved by a research ethics committee and Health Research Authority was 2037 set against and yearly target of 900. Please note uploading recruitment data is the responsibility of the Sponsor so the recruitment figures provided in this report represent the latest recruitment data available and changes may be made to recruitm ent figures at the end of the financial year. The Trust has completed recruiting patients and relatives to the Genome Medicine Centre in December; this project is part of the Government's flagship 100,000 Genome project of which national recruitment has be en achieved. 163 In total there are currently 84 clinical studies on -going at The Walton Centre and t he Trust has confirmed its capability and capacity to deliver 33 new clinical research studies during 2018/19 in Neurology, Neurosurgery and Pain. The Trust 's participation in clinical research demonstrates our commitment to improving the quality of care we offer and to making our contribution to wider health improvement. Our clinical staff actively maintain their involvement in the latest possible treatmen ts and as a Trust recognise that active participation in research leads to successful patient outcomes. During 2018/19 the Trust has worked collaboratively with the following networks and organisations to attract NIHR funding to deliver and disseminate cl inical research and innovation to inform service transformation and improvement: Clinical Research Network: North West Coast (CRN) Liverpool Health Partners (LHP) Innovation Agency, the North West Coast's Academic Health Science Network North West Coast Co llaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care (NWC CLAHRC) Local Universities Other NHS trusts and NHS organisations Pharmaceutical companies (industry) 2.3.7 CQUIN Framework & Performance Commissioning for Quality and Innovation (CQUIN) was introduced in 2009. A proportion of The Walton Centre's income in 2018/19 was conditional on achieving quality improvement and innovation goals agreed between The Walton Centre and any person or body th ey entered into a contract, agreement or arrangement with for the provision of relevant health services, through the Commissioning for Quality and Innovation payment framework. Further details of the agreed goals for 2018/19 and for the following 12 month period are available electronically at enquiries@thewaltoncentre.nhs.uk A proportion of the Trust's income in 2018/19 was conditional upon achieving quality improvement and innovation goals. The tot al payment received against the CQUINS in 2018/19 equalled \u00a31 620 000. The total payment received in 2017/18 was \u00a31 507 281. We didn't achieve the 5% improvement required from 2016 to 2018 in the three designated questions. We knew all along this would be a really tough ask for us as we started from a good position so the 5% improvement was always going to be a challenge. 164 For the first time CQUIN schemes were for two years with the following goals agreed for both 2017/18 and 2018/19. Clinical Utilisation Review Critical Care Timely Discharge (4 hr Target) Spinal Networks Medicines Optimisation Health and Wellbeing Advice and Guidance 2.3.8 Care Quality Commission (CQC) Registration The Walton Centre is required to register with the Care Quality Commission and its current registration status is registered without conditions. The CQC has not taken enforcement action against The Walton Centre during 2018/19. The CQC have undertaken an unannounced inspection during March 2019 and a w ell led inspection during April 2019. There have been no further reviews or investigations undertaken during the reporting period. During the year 2018/19 the Trust continues to self -assess against the CQC regulations. The Trust is currently awaiting t he CQC report following the above inspections. The self -assessment is supported by a governance process which enables oversight of findings and identification of areas for further review and includes a process to escalation exceptions to the Quality Commit tee. 2.3.9 Trust Data Quality The Walton Centre submitted records during 2018/19 to the Secondary Uses Service (SUS) for inclusion in the Hospital Episode Statistics which are included in the latest published data. 165 The percentage of records in the published data which included the patient's valid NHS Number was: 99.8% for admitted patient care 99.9% for outpatient care The percentage of records in the published data which included the patient's valid General Practitioner Registratio n Code was: 99.9% for outpatient care 99.9% for admitted patient care Note: These results are in relation to the latest available information at the time of publication and relate to the period 01/04/2018 to 28/02/2019 (SUS data quality dashboard). The W alton Centre's Information Governance Assessment report overall score for 2017/18 was 85% and was graded green in accordance with the Information Governance Toolkit Grading Scheme. The Information Governance Toolkit was replaced in April 2018 by the Data Security and Protection Toolkit (DSPT). The new toolkit was designed by NHS Digital to encompass the National Data Guardian reviews and the 10 data security standards and supports the key requirements under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and new Data Protection laws. The DSPT does not include levels in the same way as it did in previous years; instead it requires compliance with 40 assertions and the entire mandatory evidence items. The Trust has provided 100% of the mandatory evidence items in addition to completing and meeting 40 of the 40 assertions. The Trust has implemented additional action plans to achieve a high score on the new Data Security and Protection Toolkit and to further evidence the Trust's commitment to the Information Gov ernance (IG) agenda. A review of the evidence and self -assessments undertaken as part of the mandated 2018 -19 DS&P audit requirements has provided the Trust with a level of Substantial assurance for the ninth year in succession The latest figures from th e NHS IC Indicator portal are for 2011/12 and the national readmission rate was 11.45%. The website link is https://indicators.ic.nhs.uk/webview/ The Walton Centre undertook a Payment by Results clinical coding audit during the reporting period. The following table reflects the results of an audit carried out by an accredited internal coder and the error rates reported for this period for diagnoses and treatment coding (clinical coding) was as fol lows: 166 The Walton Centre Internal Clinical Coding Audit 2018/19 Coding Field Percentage Primary diagnosis 99% Secondary diagnosis 86% Primary procedure 97% Secondary procedure 98% The above results should not be extrapolated further than the actual sample audited. The sample covered 200 sets of clinical records which were randomly selected from across the whole range of activity and meet the level three standards as defined in the Information Governance Toolkit. The Walton Centre will be taking the following actions to improve data quality by continuing the monthly Data Quality and Systems Assurance Group meetings and overseeing Data Quality improvement. The group includes leads from all stakeholders within the o rganisation and reporting/monitoring feedback is provided via KPIs with full trend analysis. The group reports to the Information Governance and Security Forum each month which is chaired by the Trust's SIRO. The KPIs, from the group, are shared within the monthly digital update and with the Executive Team each quarter and is presented by the Head of IM&T to the Business and Performance Committee. 2.3.10 Learning from Deaths The Department of Health and Social Care published the NHS (Quality Accounts ) Amendments Regulations 2017 in July 2017. These add new mandatory disclosure requirements relating to 'Learning from Deaths' to quality accounts from 2017/18 onwards. 2.3.10.1 During 2018/19 77 of The Walton Centre patients died. This comprised the following number of deaths which occurred in each quarter of that reporting period: 24 in the first quarter 19 in the second quarter 21 in the third quarter 13 in the fourth quarter By 31st March 2019 77 case record reviews and 77 investigations have been car ried out in relation to 77 of the deaths included in item 2.3.10.1 167 In 2 cases a death was subjected to both a case record review and an investigation. The number of deaths in each quarter for which a case record review or an investigation was carried out was: 1 in the first quarter 1 in the second quarter 0 in the third quarter 0 in the fourth quarter 2.3.10.2 0 representing 0% of the patient deaths during the reporting period are judged to be more likely than not to have been due to problems in the care provided to the patient. In relation to each quarter, this consisted of: 0 representing 0% for the first quarter 0 representing 0% for the second quarter 0 representing 0% for the third quarter 0 representing 0% for the fourth quarter These numbers have b een estimated using the structured judgement review (SJR) methodology. Prior to the National Quality Board report on Learning from Deaths, The Walton Centre had a robust mechanism of mortality review where all deaths were reviewed in detail and reviewed in the mortality review group. Since the NQB report, WCFT have published an updated Mortality Review Policy, which encompasses the SJR methodology for the mortality review, but also in cases where there are potential issues highlighted a root cause analysis (RCA) is undertaken. 0 case record reviews and 0 investigations completed after 31.03.19 which related to deaths which took place before the start of the reporting period 0 representing 0% of the patient deaths before the reporting period, are judged to b e more likely than not to have been due to problems in the care provided to the patient. This number has been estimated using the process embedded within the Trust including a full health record review of each death and discussion at the respective Divis ional Mortality Meetings. 0 representing 0% of the patient deaths during 2018/19 are judged to be more likely than not to have been due to problems in the care provided to the patient. 168 2.3.11 Progress in Implementing Clinical Standards for Seven Day Ho spital Services Patient experience surveys and reports following Healthwatch listening events (Sefton and Liverpool) confirmed the standard of medical care is excellent and no concerns were raised over quality of care / Consultant presence on weekdays/weekends. No patient complaints have arisen regarding the service. A weekday da ily MDT ward round for all neurosurgery and critical care patients occurs including medical, nursing, ANP and pharmacy staff. The SMART team join the ward round at weekends. There is no formal pharmacy ward cover at weekends, and so this issue was examined in detail in January 2019 at The Quality Committee and presented to Trust Board. The overall rate of medicine reconciliation is high and given the nature of our service the committee was assured that the current pharmacy service provides very good cover. In neurology there is a weekday daily board round involving medical, nursing, pharmacy and therapy staff which has been developed since 2015, particularly with the involvement of pharmacy and therapies. This board round also takes place over the weekend. Each morning there is a neurosurgical handover meeting led by the Consultant on -call where discussions take place and scans reviewed on all patients referred overnight (whether transferred or not). This MDT meeting involves medical, ANP staff, SMART team coordinator and Bed Management Team. There is a formal handover meeting at 8pm each weekday, coordinated by the SMART coordinator and involving junior medical staff. There are well defined procedures for medical handover following each shift. Daily Consul tant reviews occur to support discharge. There is complex discharge coordinator working during the week which is covered by the Bed Management Team or Bleep Holder during the weekend. Ward based Pharmacists support the Ward Rounds and medications to take away (TTAs) are completed by the pharmacist or Advanced Nurse Practitioner. There are referral pathways for community settings and access and referral systems in place for all providers, social care and continuing health care. There is pharmacy support for TTAs at weekends. There is a process in place for repatriation to other Trusts. There is a weekly delayed discharge meeting to discuss any patients with a long length of stay and these are escalated as appropriate 2.3.12 Speaking Up The Trust's Fre edom to Speak up Guardian (FTSUG) is proactive in ensuring staff members are given the opportunity to raise concerns. The FTSUG presents to clinical and 169 non-clinical staff members during their induction. Each individual staff member receives a business c ard with specific contact details should they wish to raise a concern, arrange a meeting on/off site. Posters are displayed across the organisation and the Trust's intranet site also provides relevant information. Drop -in sessions are scheduled throughout the year across each of the areas within the Trust. There is a dedicated email address for those wishing to raise concerns. The FTSUG will agree the frequency of contact with the individual/s and post meeting or investigation will gather feedback regard ing speaking up, which has been positive to date. The FTSUG also undertakes exit interviews for those leaving the organisation in order to give staff the opportunity to raise any issues/concerns. The Trust has adopted the NHSI Raising Concerns Policy and has a Grievance Policy and Bullying and Harassment Policy which is readily available for all staff to access offering contact details such as email addresses, contact names and telephone numbers. The Head of Internal Audit gave an overall opinion of subs tantial assurance for the period 1st April 2018 to 31st March 2019 which confirms there is a good system of internal control designed to meet the organisation's objectives and the controls are generally being applied consistently. 170 Part 3 Trust Overview of Quality 2018/19 This section of the Quality Account presents an overview of performance in areas not selected as priorities for 2018/19. Presented are quantitative metrics, specific to aspects of safety, effectiveness and patient experience which are measured routinely to assure the Trust Board regarding the quality of care provided, having also been shared at a number of assurance committees within the hospital. Patient Safety Indicators Trust Acquired 2016/17 2017/18 2018/19 C Difficile 9 7 7 MRSA Bacteraemia 1 1 0 Ecoli 12 11 9 Minor and Moderate Falls 36 35 31 Never Events 3 2 2 Clinical Effectiveness Indicators Mortality - Procedure 2016/17 2017/18 2018/19 Tumour 8 8 8 Vascular 47 37 27 Cranial Trauma 21 21 14 Spinal 3 4 11 Other 15 14 17 Patient Experience Indicators Patient Experience Questions 2016/17 2017/18 2018/19 Were you involved as much as you wanted to be in decisions about your care and treatment? 99% 91% 91% Overall did you feel you were you treated with respect and dignity while you were in the hospital? 100% 98% 99% Were you given enough privacy when discussing your condition or treatment? 97% 93% 96% Did you find someone on the hospital staff to talk to about your worries and fears? 100% 84% 89% 171 3.1 Complaints 3.1.1 Patient Experience and Complaints Handling The Patient Experience Team provides help, advice and support to patients and their families, as well as helping to resolve concerns quickly on their behalf. This can be prior to, during or after their visit to the Trust. The Patient Experience Team can be contacted in various ways including telephone, email or in person whilst in the Trust. Where concerns cannot be easily resolved or are of a more serious nature, the Patient Experie nce Team are responsible for supporting the patients and their families in managing the complaint. We pride ourselves in working with patients, families and staff throughout the Trust to resolve complaints in a timely way, explaining our actions and evide ncing how services will be improved as a result of a complaint. 3.1.2 Trend Analysis and Lessons Learnt Every complaint is investigated and each complainant receives a detailed response from the Chief Executive. We ensure those responses are open and t ransparent and provide assurance that where mistakes have been made, those are rectified and lessons learned. Outcomes from complaints are reported monthly to various committees and meetings within the Trust and to the Executive Team. Any trends are repo rted to the Patient Experience Group, the Board and Council of Governors. Trends and actions taken are also discussed in detail in the Governance and Risk Quarterly report, the monthly divisional governance and risk group meetings and Quality Committee. Examples of lessons learned from complaints during 2018/19 include improvements to IT systems for patients with individual needs, staff training on use of IV medication, revision of use of cannulas, improvements to the patient referral system, and personal reflection for teams and individual staff members. 3.1.3 Complaints Activity We use feedback from people who have used the complaints process to help us improve our responsiveness and service. We have developed a person centred approach so that compla inants are kept involved and updated at each stage of the investigation, with regular contact from members of the Patient Experience Team. 172 Complaints received 01 April 2018 - 31 March 2019 Quarter 1 April-June 18 Quarter 2 July-Sept 18 Quarter 3 Oct- Dec 18 Quarter 4 Jan-Mar 19 Number of complaints received 21 23 24 27 The Trust received 95 complaints during 2018/19 which was less than the 131 complaints received during 2017/18. A key element of the person centred approach is focusing on the individual outcomes patients and families are seeking when they raise concerns. The Patient Experience Team makes contact with the patient or family member once a complaint is received to agre e the best way of addressing their concerns. This individualised approach has led to many patients or family members wishing to resolve their concerns informally rather than pursuing the formal complaints procedure. In addition to resolving complaints, whe re improvements can be made that are irrelevant to the complaint but noted in the investigation, these too are taken forward. 3.1.4 Duty of Candour The Trust fully acknowledges its duty of candour which supports one of its core values of openness. Incide nts which fall into the requirements of the regulations for this are identified through the daily scrutiny of the Datix system. Relevant incidents are identified and entered onto a tracker which manages Trust compliance against the Duty of Candour regulati ons. All patients, or in some circumstances family members, who fall into the duty of candour requirements are offered an apology by the relevant clinician as soon as possible and this is recorded appropriately. The patient or family member receive a lett er offering an apology which is signed by the Chief Executive. The letter includes an offer to receive a copy of the root cause analysis investigation. 3.2 Local Engagement - Quality Account The Quality Account has evolved by actively engaging with stakeholders and using external feedback and opinion combined with thoughts and visions from staff within The Walton Centre. Trust Executives have also participated in discussions with the local he alth economy and sought views on the services provided by the Trust. The Trust has developed strong stakeholder relationships with local Healthwatch organisations, who have conducted numerous engagement events with patients and visitors at our Trust. The Trust has further developed relationships with charities including, The Brain Charity and Headway. 173 The Trust has actively engaged with Governors through a forward planning event on all aspects of quality including choice of indicators for 2019/20. 3.3 Quality Governance A Quality Governance framework was designed as a tool to encourage and support current good practice for quality governance in healthcare organisations. The Trust developed a Quality Governance Strategy to define the combination of s tructures and processes at and below Board level to lead on Trust -wide quality performance to ensure that required standards are achieved. This now forms part of the Quality and Patient Safety strategy which sets out key priorities and the principles that the Trust will continue to develop and apply to current and future planned services The Quality and Patient Safety strategy is underpinned by the Trust's work internally to further improve patient safety and quality, and learning from national work such as the Francis Report and Berwick Review. The strategy is built on 5 foundations: 1: Leadership at all levels 2: Culture of continuous learning 3: Patient engagement 4: Build capacity and skills 5: Measurement to predict The strategy is brought to life and kept a live document with interactive Quality Berwick sessions open to all staff. Different elements of its 5 foundations are discussed, building on our leadership at all levels and culture of continuous learning. Following our Investors In Peop le inspection in 2017 the Trust has been reaccredited with the Gold standard and with the IIP health and Wellbeing award. It is a prestigious award that demonstrates the Trust's commitment to every member of the workforce and its drive to continually impro ve. The assessor of the inspection stated how impressed he was with how committed Trust staff are to delivering high quality care to all of our patients and that he could see how our staff showcase the Walton Way values in everything they do. He said that he could see that our staff have a sense of pride in working at our hospital and 'a desire to be the best'. He was also impressed with the Trust's commitment continuous improvement. This fantastic achievement reflects the hard work of teams across the organisation and the supportive friendly culture that they have created together. 174 Not only does thi s make The Walton Centre a great place to work but it also contributes to making a fantastic and caring environment for our patients to be treated in. 3.4 Hackathon Following a Clinical Senate dedicated to innovation, a number of ideas and suggestions were raised by consultants of innovations that could improve services for our patient group. The single area with the largest number of suggestions was for complex rehabilitation. Working with a number of partner organisations, we organised a two day hackathon focussed upon complex rehabilitation at the Walton Centre on the 29 -30 January 2018. This was the first ever dedicated complex rehabilitation hackathon in the UK and attendees included a broad range of trusts, universities, entrepreneurs, start up and established companies. It also featured a visit from 25 European consultants as part of the international HELIUM project. The outcome was 6 standalone initiatives and it shaped our long term vision for rehabilitation at the Trust. 3.5 Hayley's Huddle The Hayley's Huddle engagement sessions have been a big success over the last year. Hayley uses the events to share with staff how the Trust has been progressing against its' strategy, to get thoughts on any significant new initiatives or changes at the Trust, and to take questions from staff about issues at work that matter to them. Following the event a feedback sheet is shared with all staff to enable them to see what was discussed at the meeting, and to see how the plans to address any issues that were raised. 3.6 Cultural Ambassadors Programme The Walton Centre is part of a pilot programme with the Royal Collage of Nursing around Cultural Ambassadors. The Trust has recruited some of our Black and Minority Ethnic (BME) staff to receive training t o be able to support colleagues through various Human Resources (HR) processes to ensure fairness and improved cultural awareness in e.g. disciplinary, grievance and capability processes. In the future, there is also potential to widen the programme out i nto supporting fairness during recruitment processes. This is an initiative taken as part of the Trust's response to the Workforce Race Equality Standards (WRES). The Cultural Ambassadors initiative is designed to address inequalities that can arise, leading poorer outcomes for BME staff in the NHS related to the processes outlined above. 175 3.7 Anaesthesia Clinical Services Accreditation (ACSA) Department of Anaesthesia were presented with their ACSA plaque by Dr Janice Fazakerley, Vice -President of T he Royal College of Anaesthetists. The Anaesthesia Clinical Standards Accreditation (ACSA) scheme is a voluntary process that promotes quality improvement through peer review. The department of Anaesthesia along with theatre & recovery staff, SMART team a nd Specialist neurosurgical nurses prepared extensively for about 12 months for the ACSA review. The Walton Centre was the 17th trust in the UK to achieve ACSA accreditation. The department was commended for some of its outstanding processes including the way WHO Surgical Safety Checklist is conducted, arrangements for covering very long neurosurgical cases and succession planning within the department. ACSA accreditation is reviewed annually & we are pleased that the department of anaesthesia has recently received confirmation of compliance with ACSA standards for the 2nd year by The Royal College of Anaesthetists. 3.8 Epilepsy Action Award The trustees of the charity Epilepsy Action chose Dr Janine Winterbottom as the recipient of the charity's most pre stigious honour, The Lord Hastings Award. Dr Winterbottom is one of our Advanced Nurse Specialists in Epilepsy. She has worked at the Trust since 1995. She started as a Sapphire Nurse, as part of Epilepsy Action's campaign to improve healthcare services fo r people with epilepsy. The award recognises her focus on serving people with epilepsy who are planning a pregnancy. She also helped to create an animated video on the subject, which became widely shared online. She's also noted for her work for young peop le with epilepsy transitioning into adult services. The Lord Hastings Award was established by Epilepsy Action back in 1990, to recognise individuals who have made outstanding personal contributions to improving the lives of people with epilepsy. In its 2 8 year history the Award has only been given 12 times before. 3.9 Animal Therapy A three month pilot to introduce animal assisted therapy to complex rehabilitation patients at The Walton Centre has been hailed a success by patients and staff. Led by the therapies team, patients would take part in sessions every two weeks during the trial period. Many different animals, from rabbits to bearded dragons, would be there for patients to interact with at the specialist neurosciences Trust. 176 The team identif ied goals for patients, such as starting conversations about the animals to improve their speech or stroke an animal with a weaker hand to strengthen it, which contributed towards their rehabilitation. A number of positive outcomes, both physically and mentally, came out of the sessions, which were funded by The Walton Centre Charity. Initially the therapies team approached Home Safari last year to provide the sessions to patients in a three month trial period. Home Safari works within the NHS and private healthcare sector to provide animal assisted therapy in a range of different settings. With such positive results from the pilot, the therapies team is looking to make Home Safari visits a regular occurrence. 3.10 BBC Two Hospital Episode Production company Label 1 filmed a new series of 'Hospital' for BBC Two, which spanned six Trusts in Liverpool. Episode two featured The Walton Centre with three patients who received treatment here. The show aired early January 2019 and was well received inside and outside the Trust. The programme was viewed by millions of people and raised the profile of the Trust significantly. 3.11 Consultant becomes Eurospine President Specialist spinal surgeon Mr Tim Pigott has been appointed as President of EUROSPINE. A society which spans the globe seeking to improve treatment for spinal patients. Mr Pigott has been a consultant spinal surgeon at The Walton Centre for 24 years and will be President until October 2019. Mr Pigott said: \"I'm honoured and privileged to be elec ted as President. It's a fantastic organisation that promotes quality assurance, education and research. We have over 8,000 full and associate members throughout the world and I'm looking forward to the challenge of being part of this.\" 3.12 Walton Surgi cal Assistant training introduced The Walton Surgical Assistant (WSA) role was created due to an identified need for occasional assistance in the incisional phase of surgery. The traditional route to deal with this would be the Surgical First Assistant role however this was deemed unworkab le after consideration and thus the Walton Surgical Assistant Project was born. After the creation of a working group consisting of PEF Olive Tierney, Mr Nicolas Carlton -Bland & Mr David Carter a teaching programme was created in conjunction with the AFPP Surgical First Assistant Toolkit. 177 Following this, advice was sought from professional bodies and approval was given by NHS Indemnity. This will allow our senior scrub staff to not only safely assist in the incisional/exposure phase of surgery but also gai n education & development in leadership, human factors etc. 178 3.13 Navajo Accreditation The Trust successfully renewed its Navajo Chartermark, demonstrating that it welcomes and is accessible to LGBTI people. This confirms good practice, commitment and knowledge of the needs, issues and barriers facing the LGBTI community in Merseyside 3.14 Consultant wins Outstanding Health Professional in The Brain Charity Awards Dr Nick Silver has won the Outstanding Health Professional in the Brain Charity Awards. The Trust initiated the first North West service specifically for patients with severe and refractory headaches and continues to improve and enlarge the service. This offers greater access to more patients and referrals are received nationwide for the most severely disabled patients who remain refractory to many established conventional therapies. The Trust now have the second largest unit in the UK for dedicated hea dache diagnosis and treatment with four consultant neurologists with interest in headache, a nurse specialist and a number of specialist nurse injectors. Regularly positive feedback is received for our services and our management that utilises approaches far beyond standard textbooks and treatment pathways. 3.15 CPMP service in Warrington In collaboration with NHS Warrington Clinical Commissioning Group the Trust has provided a Community Pain Management Programme (CPMP) for people with persistent back pain and/or associated leg pain which has lasted for more than three months. The service is also available for patients who may have had back pain for many years. The programme forms part of a wider package of care i n line with NHS England's National Back and Radicular Pain Pathway, designed to ensure patients get faster access to the treatment they need. The Trust has been successfully treating people with chronic pain for over 30 years and this pilot is a new way of bringing this service to patients who may not have been able to travel to the hospital. All Community PMP sessions are run by an experienced multidisciplinary team of physiotherapists, clinical psychologists and occupational therapists. Patients previousl y had to travel to The Walton Centre for treatment, but this new method brings therapy sessions closer to the patient. 179 3.16 The Walton Journey The Walton Six Steps has been introduced which are six key stages of the patient and family experience at The Wal ton Centre. The steps are - Why us, Arrival, Liaising, Treatment, Ongoing care and Next steps. These steps provide guidance regarding the process for collating feedback from patients and their families in relation to their experiences. This information h as been gathered through walkabouts and from the process of shadowing. These are undertaken by two staff members to encourage ownership of feedback and enhanced communication between staff groups. 3.17 Overview of Performance in 2018/19 against Natio nal Priorities from the Department of Health's Operating Framework The following table outlines the Trust's performance in relation to the performance indicators as set out in the Department of Health's Operating Framework. Note: RTT figures reported within the Quality Account includes revised figures resubmitted for the period Apr 2018 -Aug 2018. However, revisions are published periodically (usually every six months) in line with NHS England Analytical Service. 3.18 Overview of Performance in 2018/19 against NHS Outcomes Framework The Department of Health and NHSI identified changes to Quality Account reporting requirements for 2012/13 and subsequent rounds of Quality Accounts, following consideration by the National Quality Board of introducing mandatory reporting against a small, core set of quality indicators. Performance Indicator 2017/18 Performance 2018/19 Target 2018/19 Performance Incidence of MRSA 1 0 0 Screening all in -patients for MRSA 95.26% 95% 95% Incidence of Clostridium difficile 7 9 7 All Cancers : Maximum wait time of 31 days for second or subsequent treatment: surgery 100% 94% 100% All Cancers : 62 days wait for 1st treatment from urgent GP referral to treatment 100% 85% 100% All Cancers : Maximum waiting time of 31 days from diagnosis to first treatment 100% 96% 99% All Cancers : 2 week wait from referral date to date first seen 99.62% 93% 100% Maximum time of 18 weeks from point of referral to treatment in aggregate - patients on an incomplete pathway 95% 92% 94.27% Maximum 6 week wait for diagnostic procedures 0.06% <1% 0.06% Certification against compliance with requirements regarding access to health care for people with a learning disability Fully Compliant Fully Compliant 180 The indicators are based on recommendations by the National Quality Board, are set out overleaf. They align closely with the NHS Outcomes Framework and are all based on data that trusts already report on nationally. If the indicators are applicable to us the intention is that we will be required to report: Our performance against these indicators The national average A supporting commentary, which may explain variation from the national average and any steps taken or planned to improve quality. The data within this report is local data that has not been validated nationally. During 2018/19, the Walton Centre provided and/or sub -contracted four relevant health services. These were neurology, neurosurgery, pain management and rehabilitation. 3.19 Indicators The indicators are listed below and a response is provided if they are deemed applicable to the Trust. If the indicators are deemed not applicable a rationale for this status is provided. 1. Summary Hospital -Level Mortality Indicator (SHMI): NOT APPLICABLE Rationale: This indicator is not deemed applicable to the Trust, t he technical specification states that Specialist Trusts are excluded from this measurement and that this decision was made by the CQC in June 2011 2. Percentage of Patients on Care Programme Approach: NOT APPLICABLE Rationale: The Trust does not provide mental health services 3. Catego ry A Ambulance response times: NOT APPLICABLE Rationale: The Trust is not an ambulance trust 4. Care Bundles - including myocardial infarction and stroke: NOT APPLICABLE Rationale: The Trust is not an ambulance trust 181 5. Percentage of Admissions to acute wards for which the Crisis Resolution Home Treatment Team acted as gatekeeper during the reporting period: NOT APPLICABLE Rationale: The Trust does not provide mental health services 6. Patient reported outcome scores for (i) groin hernia surgery, (ii) varicose vein surgery, (iii) hip replacement surgery, and (iv) knee replacement surgery: NOT APPLICABLE Rationale: The Trust does not perform these procedures 7. Emergency readmissions to hospital within 28 days of discharge: APPLICABLE Response: No. of readmissions % of Inpatient Discharges 2017/18 251 4.6% 2018/19 266 5.0% Change -24 -0.5% Calculation of readmission rates is based on the national standard as defined within the Compendium of clinical and Health Indicators. ( https://indicators.ic.nhs.uk/webview/ ). The rates are for patients 16 years and over as The Walton Centre do es not treat patients under the age of 16. Actions to be taken The Walton Centre considers that this data is as described for the following reasons: The Trust recognises that the main causes for readmissions are due to infection and post - operative complications The Walton Centre has taken the following actions to improve this rate, and so the quality of its services, by: Consultant review of all readmissions to ensure any lessons learnt are embedded into future practice. 182 8. Responsiveness to inpatients' personal needs based on five questions in the CQC National Inpatient Survey: APPLICABLE Response: This year our designated company did not manage to achieve sufficient responses from the IP National Survey du e to an internal error on their part. This resulted in 29% of our patients completing the survey, however, it was confirmed by the CQC that we would be unable to share this data. The data that we received did however highlight that significant improvements had been made across the hospital resulting in: We were the most improved Trust out of the 77 Picker organisations compared to last year Our scores were significantly better th an last year in 16 questions (there were no questions last year where we were significantly better than the previous year) There were no questions where we were significantly worse than last year (we were significantly worse on 11 questions in the last sur vey compared to the previous year) We were significantly better than the Picker average on 37 questions (this was only 26 last year) There were no questions where we were significantly worse than the Picker average (there were 4 questions last year where w e were significantly worse than the Picker average) The Walton Centre undertakes regular patient and family engagement through several methods and this will be continued over the next twelve months to ensure that we act on relevant, current feedback.

Apr 2018 May 2018 Jun 2018 Jul 2018 Aug 2018 Sep 2018 Oct 2018 Nov 2018 Dec 2018 Jan 2019 Feb 2019 Mar of staff who would recommend the provider to friends or family needing care: APPLICABLE Response: The Trust had a response rate of 53% for the 2018 national staff survey; an increase of 11% from 2017, the national average for acute specialist trusts in England for 2018 was 53%. Within the survey, the percentage of staff who would recommend the Trust as a place to work remained similar to 2017 at 77% and the percentage of staff who would recommend the Trust as a place to receive treatment\" remained the same at around 90%. The reporting outputs for the 2018 Staff Survey have changed; results are themed across 10 areas as follows: Equality Diversity & Inclusion Health & Wellbeing Immediate Managers Morale Quality of appraisals Quality of care Safe environment ( Bullying and Harassment) Safe environment ( Violence) Safety Culture Staff Engagement The 20 18 results show no statistically significant change across any of the themes, though key highlights include improved equality and diversity, the organisations interest in health and well -being and overall staff engagement. In addition to the annual sta ff survey, a staff Friends and Family Test has also taken place on a quarterly basis this year. The purpose of these is to assess how likely employees are to 184 recommend the Walton Centre as a place to work and also as a place to receive treatment. The resul ts have been extremely positive. In Quarter 1, the Friends and Family Test was issued to approximately 400 staff using an online survey and 124 surveys were returned. The results showed that 98% of staff were 'extremely likely' or 'likely' to recommend th e Walton Centre to friends and family if they needed care or treatment and 83% of staff said they were 'extremely likely' or 'likely' to recommend the Walton Centre to friends and family as a place to work. In Quarter 2, the Friends and Family Test was is sued to a further circa 400 staff with 109 being returned. The results showed that 98% of staff were 'extremely likely' or 'likely' to recommend the Walton Centre to friends and family if they needed care or treatment and 89% of staff said they were 'extre mely likely' or 'likely' to recommend the Walton Centre to friends and family as a place to work. Quarter 4 results had 212 complete the survey, 100% of staff were 'extremely likely' or 'likely' to recommend the Walton Centre to friends and family if the y needed care or treatment and 86% of staff said they were 'extremely likely' or 'likely' to recommend the Walton Centre to friends and family as a place to work Key staff survey questions: KF19 Organisation and management interest in and action on health and wellbeing: The Trust score for 2018 was 49% with the national average being 34% the Trust had the best score for an acute specialist trust for the 4th year. KF27 Percentage of staff/colleagues reporting most recent experience of harassment, bullying or abuse: The Trust score was 52% with the average score for acute specialist trusts being 49%. The trust had a score of 52% last year. The Trust has encouraged staff over the past year through various staff engagement events to raise concerns, we work closely with staff side to address any issues raised and have highlighted the role of the \"Freedom to Speak Up Guardian\" across the Trust. KF26 Percentage of staff experiencing harassment, bullying or abuse from staff in the last 12 months: (the lower th e score the better) 185 The Trust score was 17% the average score for acute specialist trusts being 18.8%. This was a slight increase from the 2016 score of 16%. KF21 Percentage believing that Trust provides equal opportunities for career progression or promotion) for the Workforce Race Equality Standard: (the higher the score the better) The Trust score was 91% better than the national average of 86% and an increase fr om last year's score of 88%. The Walton Centre has taken the following actions to improve this rate and the quality of its services, by: The Trust intends to continue to work with staff side and staff through various engagement sessions to increase the response rates and percentage scores for the following year. An action plan has been approved by Board and feedback will also take place to advise staff what action the Trust has taken in response to their comments. Although it is important to recognise that the themes had no significant changes the Trust action plan will also focus on any areas where the findings were slightly less positive . 10. Patient Experience of Community Mental Health Services: NOT APPLICABLE Rationale: The Trust does not provide mental health services 11. Percentage of admitted patients risk -assessed for Venous Thromboembolism: APPLICABLE Response: * To be updated National data published YEAR 95.49% 95.65% * 186 The Walton Centre considers that this data is as described for the following reasons: The risk assessments are carried out by nursing staff within 6 hours of admission, mechanical VTE prevention interventions (use of anti -thrombolytic stockings) are carri ed out by nursing staff with a medical review regarding pharmacological interventions (medications). The Walton Centre has taken the following actions to improve this rate, and so the quality of its services, by: All VTEs are subject to a full Root Caus e analysis, where any lapses in care, processes or practice are identified. In keeping with the Duty of Candour, the patients are given details of how the reports can be shared with them. 12. Rate of C. difficile per 100,000 bed days amongst patients age d two years and over: APPLICABLE Response: Quality Accounts use the rate of cases of C. difficile infections rather than the incidence, because it provides a more helpful measure for the purpose of making comparisons between organisations and tracking improvements over time. WCFT Clostridium 15.6 21.0 21.6 15.7 14.5 13.3 13.7 The Walton Centre considers that this data is as described for the following reasons: In 2018/19 The Walton Centre had a total of 7 Clostridium difficile infections against the trajectory set by NHSE of 9. To achieve such a reduction is a fantastic outcome which is a consequence of the outstanding work undertaken by all of the staff Trust wide. The Walton Centre has taken the following actions to improve this rate, and so the quality of its services, by: Setting clear objectives, implementation and monitoring of the Healthcare Associated Infection (HCAI) reduction plan 187 Monthly audit and monitoring of the environment including the use of Clean -Trace to check the quality of environmental and equipment clean ing Introduction of Clean -Trace electronic reporting to identify themes, trends and areas of concern across the clinical areas Robust programme of infection prevention control audit Monitoring and reporting infection prevention outcomes to the Quality Co mmittee Launch of the Infection Prevention Champions programme to enable engagement of all staff groups to promote ownership, and support effective infection prevention in the clinical areas Use of technology e.g. Ultra V and Hydrogen Peroxide Vapour (HP V) to enhance our cleaning programmes Identification of additional resources to support excellence in antibiotic prescribing and support education and training of clinical staff The Trust will continually strive to review and improve the quality of its service and aims to reduce healthcare associated infection, including Clostridium difficile to ensure that all of our service users within the Trust, are not harmed by a preventable infection. 13. Rate of patient safety incidents and percentage resulting in severe harm or Death: APPLICABLE Response: In 2018/19 1147 incidents occurred against 15,266 admissions (excluding OPD as per NLRS figures) this equals 7.86 per 100 admissions. The Walton Centre considers that this data is as described for the following reasons: Increased patient acuity Increase in capacity and activity The Walton Centre will take the following actions to improve this score, and so the quality of its services, by: The Trust investigates all incidents that are reported and ensures that any lessons learned can be shared across all relevant staff groups. Where there are found to be gaps in care delivery, processes and policies are updated and put in place to support th e delivery of safe and quality care to ensure these incidents do not re -occur. 188 The Trust will continue to: Discuss all root cause analysis at the relevant meetings to ensure the sharing of learning Trust wide Share lessons learnt via the Governance safety bulletin Improve the reporting of incidents through discussions at the Trust safety huddle 189 Annex 1 The Walton Centre Quality Account Commentary Healthwatch Liverpool welcomes this opportunity to comment on the Quality Account of 2018 -19. We base these comments on the contents of a draft Quality Account which was provided to us prior to publication, as well as our ongoing engagement with the Trust and feedb ack received from patients and families. In relation to the priorities over the past year, it is reassuring to see that progress has been made against the majority of these. We are particularly pleased to see the work done around capturing patient, family and carer feedback through a variety of methods and triangulating this feedback with other quality indicators. We encourage the Trust to continue this work to ensure that patient feedback continues to be sought and, most importantly, acted upon where nece ssary. Although the Trust considers that several of the priorities from the past year have been achieved, we note that improvements have been modest in some areas. For example, figures around non -clinical cancelled operations and staff resilience training appear to be low, suggesting that further work is needed in these areas. As with all Trusts in Liverpool, we hold an annual Listening Event where a team of staff and volunteers from Healthwatch Liverpool visits the hospital to speak to patients and visit ors about their experiences. These events are intended to provide a snapshot of what patients and visitors think about the service. The Trust can then use this feedback in conjunction with other patient experience measures to provide valuable insight. This year we visited the Walton Centre on 20th November 2018 and spoke to a total of 32 people. The feedback was generally very positive, with 94% of the people we spoke to rating the Walton Centre as being 4 or 5 stars out of 5. Our Listening Event did highl ight however that a minority of patients felt that communication between specialists and front line staff about their treatment could be improved so that information could then be passed on in a more timely manner. We encourage the Trust to explore whether this has been a more prevalent issue and how it might be addressed. All of our findings from the Listening Event have been shared with the Trust. In relation to the priorities for 2019 -20, it is positive to see the inclusion of a priority to support equ ality and diversity, specifically providing better support for patients' religious and cultural beliefs in the Theatre Department. Whilst we welcome this priority, we are aware of other areas within the Trust where equality and diversity issues have been b rought to our attention. For example, we have received feedback about a lack of appropriate interpreting support within PALS leading to delays in complaints and concerns being acted upon for those whose English is limited. We therefore encourage the Trust to maintain a focus on equality and diversity issues across all departments and services. Overall, the Trust is clearly striving to continually improve their services and we look forward to continuing to work closely with the Trust over the forthcoming y ear. 190 The Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust Quality Account 2018 - 2019 Healthwatch Sefton would like to thank the Trust for the opportunity to comment on the draft Quality Account 2018 -19. We attended the Quality Priorities engagement event held on Friday 3rd May 2019. Healthwatch Sefton would like to note that the Quality Account has b een set out in a clear format which has been easy to follow and clearly demonstrates the achievements for 2018 - 2019 followed by the priorities for 2019 - 2020. The Trust has continued to work in partnership with Healthwatch Sefton with monthly Healthwa tch stands held at both the main hospital entrance and the Sid Watkins building. The latest Healthwatch Sefton feedback report detailing patient, visitor and staff feedback between January 2018 - December 2018 highlighted that the Trust achieved an overal l average of 4.5 out of 5 stars. Themes including Quality of Treatment, Staff attitude and cleanliness scored 5 out of 5 stars. Healthwatch Sefton in particular would like to comment on the below achievements recorded within the Quality Account: Extend He alth and Wellbeing Programme to improve staff resilience and mindfulness - It is pleasing to see the Trust continues to place utmost importance on staff wellbeing and morale and it is an excellent achievement to be reaccredited with Investors in People (II P) Gold standard. Improve the way we listen and act on patient, family and carer feedback - This priority has been achieved through various models of capturing feedback including the inclusion of external partners Healthwatch Sefton and the Brain Charity . Healthwatch Sefton will continue to work in partnership with the Trust to capture the feedback of patients, family and visitors. Moving forward Healthwatch Sefton would like to comment on the below Quality Aims 2019 - 2020 Pre and Post Operative discus sions with theatre teams - This is a welcomed priority and Healthwatch feel having these conversations with patients will help to alleviate patient and family concerns and anxieties. During Healthwatch Sefton outreach patients and family members do comment on this area and this will be incorporated into the Healthwatch Sefton feedback reports. Contacting patients who require telemetry tests prior to admission to reduce the rate of DNAs - Due to the Trust covering a wide geographical area this is felt to be beneficial and efficient for both the Trust and the patient. 191 Introduce patient and family centred champions - The Trust is demonstrating their continued dedication to listening to and following the patient journey to ensure patients and families receive the best care. It is good to note within the Progress - Implementing Clinical Standards for Seven Day Hospital Services that both hospital discharge and pharmacy services are included in the work plan. The Speaking Up campaign is notably present when vi siting the Trust to ensure staff members have the opportunity to raise any concerns. Both Healthwatch Sefton and the Trust will continue to work together to ensure the voices of patients, family and visitors are listened to and acted upon. 192 Healthwatch Warrington is pleased to be asked to review The Walton Centre's 2018 -19 Quality Account (QA) and think about the current and future priorities in the document. As Warrington's consumer champion for health and social care, we recognise the impac t that patient experiences have in shaping the quality and safety of services, and the importance of including experiences of patients from our area who receive care from the Walton Centre. We look at the Trust's performance in relation to four key questi ons: Does the draft Quality Account reflect people's real experiences as told to local Healthwatch by service users and their families and carers over the past year? Healthwatch Warrington has not received feedback this year from local users of Walton Cent re (either the main site or the local community pain management service). Unfortunately, there were difficulties with the National inpatient survey, so data from only a small sample (29%) of patients was recorded, which showed an improvement on last year, but examples of this could not be included. 98 -100% of patients would recommend the Walton Centre based on the family and friends questionnaire monthly figures. From what people have told local Healthwatch, is there evidence that any of the basic things ar e not being done well by the provider? Healthwatch Warrington does not have evidence of system -wide failure to provide health care within the Trust. Rates of hospital acquired infections, and never events remain low and similar to the last 2 years. The tru st received fewer complaints in 201819 (95) than in 2017 -8 (131). The process for response to complaints is given, but not the data on response to complaints, which could be helpful to readers. Is it clear from the draft Quality Account that there is a lea rning culture within the provider organisation that allows people's real experiences to be captured and used to enable the provider to get better at what it does year on year? Looking at the priorities for 2017 -18, there are examples where people's experie nces have been used to improve care: Reduce Falls. The Trust introduced a post fall questionnaire to help staff talk to people after they fall. Feedback from this will be included in a patient information leaflet for falls. Mild and moderate falls have fal len from 35 in 2017 -18 to 31 in 2018 -19. Reduce non -clinical cancelled operations year on year. There has been a 7.14% reduction in the number of non -clinical cancelled operations during 2018/19 (156) when compared with 2017/18 (168). Safety Huddle . A daily meeting of staff to discuss patient safety issues, and share lessons learned quickly throughout the organisation. 193 Patient Experience. There has been a significant increase in social media followers (over 16,000). Social media has been used to shar e urgent information, ask people to help with the trust plans, and general messages about organ donation, and infection control. Feedback is recorded acted upon by the Patient Experience Team. It is interesting that this has lead to more compliments, which have helped staff morale. Improve the way we listen and act on patient, family and carer feedback. The trust have approached this through local Healthwatch, charity, and clinician -led engagement events, and through the Neuro Buddy volunteer service. The patient experience indicators do show a fall in number of people who found someone on the hospital staff to talk to about their worries and fears (100% in 206 -17, 84% in 2017 -18 and 89% in 2018 -19). It would be interesting to see if this improves with the introduction of these patient -focused priorities. The Trust continues to encourage incident reporting and learning from incidents. In 2018/19 1147 incidents occurred against 15,266 admissions. From the Quality Account, this appears to be an increase in in cidents reported, but previous data is not available. The report stated this is due to increased activity and the learning culture in place. Comparative data would be helpful for readers to interpret this information. The Trust demonstrates a learning cul ture by asking academic teams the best ways to engage with patients their carers and families. We note that events are planned for 2019 -20 and would be happy to work with the Trust on these. The emphasis on clinical research, the range of national and aud it projects, the education and training priorities and the processes for feedback from volunteers and social media show that the Walton Centre has a learning culture. It will be good to have examples of how some of the feedback from buddies and social medi a has helped improve quality over the next year. Are the priorities for improvement as set out in the draft Quality Account challenging enough to drive improvement and it is clear how improvement has been measured in the past and how it will be measured in the future? The priorities in the Quality Account are ambitious and cover a many aspects of care, including: Encouraging staff to communicate with patients their families and carers (pre and post-operative discussions with the theatre team, asking staff to become a champion for patient and family centred care, supporting people on their treatment journey) Improving use of services and individualising care (checking if people still need their telemetry appointments, offering scan results by letter rather t han appointment) Recognising cultural differences (supporting people's religious beliefs and cultures in theatre) Improving the high standard of care (introducing aseptic non touch technique, refurbishment of day rooms) Staff training (Masters neurosciences training module, new methods for planning quality improvement projects). 194 Many of these priorities were agreed based on patient and staff feedback, and this, and the focus on training, emphasise the learning culture at the Walton Ce ntre. However, It is not clear in the document how all these outcomes will be monitored and reported. 195 The Walton Centre Quality Account 2018/19 NHS England, Liverpool CCG (LCCG), Formby CCG and Knowsley CCG wishes to thank The Walton Centre for the opportunity to comment on their Quality Account for 2018/19. Commissioners are committed to working in partnership with The Walton Centre to provide safe, high quality care and services. The Quality Account accurately reflects the performance for the organisation. The account demonstrates a high number of priority areas year on year, clearly setting out the achievements and outcomes against priority areas for 18/19 which have been achieved as a result of sta ff and patient engagement and commitment. The account also demonstrates the additional quality achievements of the Trust, including a real focus on patient experience. The work to ensure staff safety should be noted, this demonstrates that the Trust has listened to responses from the staff survey and has acted to keep staff safe and supported. The quality account reports a reduction of 7.14% in non -clinical cancelled operations in the last year, which is commendable. Commissioners are keen to see furthe r progress in reducing cancelled operations in the forthcoming year, maintaining this as a priority for the Trust. The increasing use of communication via social media is positive, Commissioners would like to see how this impacts on improvements in patient experience over time. The priority areas for the coming year have been developed in collaboration with stakeholders and demonstrate a commitment to quality improvement, there is clear evidence of monitoring and measurements. The account details wide vari ety of priorities and a real focus on Equality and Diversity, the use of telemedicine to improve patient experience and effectiveness and active patient engagement. There is evidence of strong governance processes through the organisation and a clear lin e of site from 'floor to Board' with an open and honest culture of reporting within the Trust. Participation in National and Local audit is clear, with visible actions leading to change in practice and improvements in care. Over the last year it is good to see the consistently positive responses to friends and family test with between 98 - 100% of people likely to recommend the services. Again, Commissioners are happy to report that the quality account demonstrates the Trusts commitment to management of I nfection prevention. There were 7 reported cases of Clostridium difficile (CDiff) against a trajectory of 9 cases set by NHSI. There is new guidance for reporting of CDiff for 19/20 and we will be keen to see further strategies for improvement and engageme nt with the health economy. The trust has provided high levels of quality assurance throughout 2018/19 through regular reporting via the Integrated Performance and Quality report. Commissioners work with the Trust in reviewing quality at Clinical Quality and Performance and Contracti ng meetings. NHS England and NHS Improvement 196 CQC rated the Walton Centre as outstanding in 2016, which is a great achievement, a recent reinspection has been carried out and at the time of completing the Commissioner statement the rating has yet to be c onfirmed. We look forward to continuing to work in partnership with The Walton Centre to further improve quality and experience for patients.

The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union, and as interpreted and adapted by the Accounts Directions issued under the National Service Act 2006, the NHS foundation trust annual reporting manual 2018/19 and the Department of Health and Social Care group accounting manual 2018/19. In our opinion the financial statements: give a true and fair view of the financial position of the group and of the Trust as at 31 March 2019 and of the group 's expenditure and income and the Trust's expenditure and income for the year then ended; have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union, as interpreted and adapted by the Department of Health and Social Care group accounting manual 2018/19; and have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the National Health Service Act 2006. Basis for opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor 's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the group and the Trust in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC's Ethical Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Conclusions relating to going concern We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the ISAs (UK) require us to report to you where: the Accounting Officer's use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is not appropriate; or the Accounting Officer has not disclosed in the financial statements any identified material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt about the group's or the Trust's ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting for a period of at least twelve months from the date when the financial statements are authorised for issue. 201 Overview of our audit approach Financial statements audit Overall materiality: \u00a32,409,000 which represents 2% of the group's gross operating expenses; The key audit matter identified was: - Contract variations and other non-contract revenue recognition Conclusion on the Trust's arrangements for securing economy, efficiency and effectiveness in its use of resources We identified one significant risk in respect of the Trust's arrangements for securing economy, efficiency and effectiveness in its use of resources (see Report on other legal and regulatory requirements section). Key audit matters The graph below depicts the financial statement audit risks identified and their relative significance based on the extent of the financial statement impact and the extent of management judgement. Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current year and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These matters included those that had the greatest effect on the overall audit strategy; the allocatio n of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters 202 Key Audit Matter -Group How the matter was addressed in the audit - Group Contract variations and other non -contract revenue recognition Approximately 90% of the group's operating income is for income from patient care activities, which includes \u00a312.186 million from block contracts, \u00a3102.573 million from activity based contracts and \u00a32.729 million from non-contract activities. Block and activity based contract variations and non- contract activity income is subject to verification and agreement by the Trust's commissioners. We therefore identified the occurrence and accuracy of income from contract variations and non-contract activity as a significant risk, which was one of the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement. Our audit work included, but was not restricted to: evaluating the Trust's accounting policy for recognition of income from patient care activities and other operating revenue for appropriateness and compliance with the DHSC Group Accounting Manual 2018/19; gaining an understanding of the Trust's system for accounting for income from patient care and other operating revenue, and evaluate the design of the associated controls; agreeing, on a sample basis, income from contract variations and year-end receivables to signed contract variations, invoices or other supporting evidence such as correspondence from the Trust's commissioners; evaluating the Trust's estimates and the judgments made by management with regard to corroborating evidence in order to arrive at the total income from contract variations recorded in the financial statements; agreeing, on a sample basis, income and year end receivables from other operating revenue to invoices and cash payment or other supporting evidence; and testing, on a sample basis, invoices raised in March and April to ensure revenues have been accounted for in the correct period. The Trust's accounting policy on operating income is shown in note 1.4 to the financial statements and related disclosures are included in notes 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3. Key observations We obtained sufficient audit evidence to conclude that: the group's accounting policy for recognition of operating income complies with the DHSC Group Accounting Manual 2018/19 and has been properly applied; and income from NHS contract variations and non- contract activity is not materially misstated. Our application of materiality We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality in determining the nature, timing and extent of our audit work and in evaluating the results of that work. Materiality was determined as follows: 203 Materiality Measure Group Trust Financial statements as a whole \u00a32,409,000 which is 2% of the group's gross operating expenses. This benchmark is considered the most appropriate because we consider users of the financial statements to be most interested in how the group has expended its revenue and other funding. Materiality for the current year is at the same percentage level of gross operating expenses as we determined for the year ended 31 March 2018 as we did not identify any significant changes in the group or the environment in which it operates. \u00a32,402,000 which is 2% of the Trust's gross operating expenses. This benchmark is considered the most appropriate because we consider users of the financial statements to be most interested in how the Trust has expended its revenue and other funding. Materiality for the current year is at the same percentage level of gross operating costs as we determined for the year ended 31 March 2018 as we did not identify any significant changes in the Trust or the environment in which it operates. Performance materiality used to drive the extent of our testing 75% of financial statement materiality 75% of financial statement materiality Specific materiality Disclosure of senior managers' remuneration in the Remuneration Report: \u00a320,000, based on 2% of the total senior managers' remuneration. This is due to public interest in these disclosures and the statutory requirement for them to be made. Communication of misstatements to the Audit Committee \u00a3120,000 and misstatements below that threshold that, in our view, warrant reporting on qualitative grounds. \u00a3120,000 and misstatements below that threshold that, in our view, warrant reporting on qualitative grounds. The graph below illustrates how performance materiality interacts with our overall materiality and the tolerance for potential uncorrected misstatements. An overview of the scope of our audit Our audit approach was a risk-based approach founded on a thorough understanding of the group 's business, its environment and risk profile and in particular included: Evaluation by the group audit team of identified components to assess the significance of that component and to determine the planned audit response based on a measure of materiality. For example, significance as a percentage of the group 's gross costs based on qualitative factors, such as specific use or concerns over specific components; Gaining an understanding of and evaluating the Trust's internal controls environment including its financial and IT systems and controls; Full scope audit procedures on The Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust which represents 93% of the group's income, 59% of the group's expenditure and 81% of its total assets; Analytical procedures on the Walton Centre Charity; 204 Testing, on a sample basis of all of the Trust's material income and expenditure streams, covering 76% of the Trust's income and operating expenses, 70% of the Trust's expenditure and current and non-current assets, 78% of the Trust's total assets and current and non-current liabilities and 70% of the Trust's total liabilities. Other information The Accounting Officer is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report , other than the financial statements and our auditor 's report thereon. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of the other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. In this context, we also have nothing to report in regard to our responsibility to specifically address the following items in the other information and to report as uncorrected material misstatements of the other information where we conclude that those items meet the following conditions: Fair, balanced and understandable in accordance with provision C.1.1 of the NHS Foundation Trust Code of Governance - the statement given by the directors that they consider the Annual Report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for patients, regulators and other stakeholders to assess the group and Trust 's performance, business model and strategy, is materially inconsistent with our knowledge of the Trust obtained in the audit; or Audit Committee reporting in accordance with provision C.3.9 of the NHS Foundation Trust Code of Governance - the section describing the work of the Audit Committee does not appropriately address matters communicated by us to the Audit Committee. Other information we are required to report on by exception under the Code of Audit Practice Under the Code of Audit Practice published by the National Audit Office on behalf of the Comptroller and Auditor General (the Code of Audit Practice) we are required to consider whether the Annual Governance Statement does not meet the disclosure requirements set out in the NHS foundation trust annual reporting manual 2018/19 or is misleading or inconsistent with the information of which we are aware from our audit.. We are not required to consider whether the Annual Governance Statement addresses all risks and controls or that risks are satisfactorily addressed by internal controls. We have nothing to report in this regard. Our opinion on other matters required by the Code of Audit Practice is unmodified In our opinion: the parts of the Remuneration Report and the Staff Report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, as interpreted and adapted by the NHS foundation trust annual reporting manual 2018/19 and the requirements of the National Health Service Act 2006; and based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit of the financial statements and our knowledge of the Trust gained through our work in relation to the Trust 's arrangements for securing economy, efficiency and effectiveness in its use of resources, the other information published together with the financial statements in the Annual Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements. 205 Matters on which we are required to report by exception Under the Code of Audit Practice, we are required to report to you if: we issue a report in the public interest under Schedule 10 (3) of the National Health Service Act 2006 in the course of, or at the conclusion of the audit; or we refer a matter to the regulator under Schedule 10 (6) of the National Health Service Act 2006 because we have reason to believe that the Trust, or a director or officer of the Trust, is about to make, or has made, a decision which involves or would involve the incurring of expenditure that was unlawful, or is about to take, or has begun to take a course of action which, if followed to its conclusion, would be unlawful and likely to cause a loss or deficiency . We have nothing to report in respect of the above matters. Responsibilities of the Accounting Officer and Those Charged with Governance for the financial statements As explained more fully in the Statement of Accounting Officer's responsibilities as the accounting officer, the Chief Executive, as Accounting Officer, is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements in the form and on the basis set out in the Accounts Directions included in the NHS foundation trust annual reporting manual 2018/19, for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the Accounting Officer determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, the Accounting Officer is responsible for assessing the group 's and the Trust 's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Accounting Officer has been informed by the relevant national body of the intention to dissolve the Trust and the group without the transfer of the Trust's services to another public sector entity. The Audit Committee is Those Charged with Governance. Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Trust's financial reporting process. Auditor 's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor 's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council 's website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities . This description forms part of our auditor 's report. Report on other legal and regulatory requirements - Conclusion on the Trust 's arrangements for securing economy, efficiency and effectiveness in its use of resources Matter on which we are required to report by exception - Trust 's arrangements for securing economy, efficiency and effectiveness in its use of resources Under the Code of Audit Practice, we are required to report to you if, in our opinion we have not been able to satisfy ourselves that the Trust has made proper arrangements for securing economy, efficiency and effectiveness in its use of resources for the year ended 31 March 2019 . 206 We have nothing to report in respect of the above matter. Significant risks Under the Code of Audit Practice, we are required to report on how our work addressed the significant risks we identified in forming our conclusion on the adequacy of the Trust's arrangements for securing economy, efficiency and effectiveness in its use of resources. Significant risks are those risks that in our view had the potential to cause us to reach an inappropriate conclusion on the audited body's arrangements. The table below sets out the significant risk we identified. The significant risk was addressed in the context of our conclusion on the Trust's arrangements as a whole, and in forming our conclusion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these risks. Significant risk How the matter was addressed in the audit Financial planning, reporting and delivery of financial targets Before the start of each financial year the Trust agrees to a control total set by NHS Improvement (NHSI) which determines the target financial performance for the financial year. Achievement of the control total also ensures the Trust receives additional Provider Sustainability Funding (PSF). The Trust's control total for 2018/19 was a \u00a33 million surplus. The Trust identified a number of risks to the achievement of the control total. The biggest issue being an expected shortfall against the cost improvement programme though the Quality Improvement Programme (QIP). A higher reliance on one-off non-recurring measures were expected to achieve the financial target. Our audit work included, but was not restricted to: reviewing the monitoring arrangements in place at the Trust to keep Board members informed of progress against its operational plan and achievement of its control total for the financial year 2018/19; and reviewing the arrangements in place to manage the risks to the achievement of financial targets. Key findings The Trust achieved a \u00a35.8 million surplus in delivering its services in 2018/19. This was in excess of the \u00a33 million control total agreed with the Department for Health and Social Care (DHSC) and NHSI. The increased surplus is largely due to additional income from the PSF received for meeting the agreed control total. PSF income received was \u00a34.7 million, with \u00a32.3 million of the PSF budgeted as core funding, with an additional \u00a32.4 million incentive notified in April 2019 by NHSI. In 2018/19 the Trust delivered recurrent CIP savings of \u00a31.13 million against a target of \u00a33.2 million. Throughout the year the financial position has been actively monitored and clearly reported to the Board through the Integrated Performance Report (IPR) which includes the current financial position and forecasted information to the year end. There are appropriate arrangements in place to produce the 2019/20 financial plan that commenced in November 2018 with the finance team working with operational and clinical divisions. There is a total recurrent CIP requirement of \u00a32.87 million for 2019/20. As at May 2019, \u00a30.9 million has been identified of the 2019/20 CIP. Overall we concluded that the Trust has appropriate arrangements in place for monitoring and reporting to Board on financial performance and for managing the risks to non - delivery of financial targets. 207 Responsibilities of the Accounting Officer The Accounting Officer is responsible for putting in place proper arrangements for securing economy, efficiency and effectiveness in the use of the Trust 's resources. Auditor 's responsibilities for the review of the Trust 's arrangements for securing economy, efficiency and effectiveness in its use of resources We are required under paragraph 1 of Schedule 10 of the National Health Service Act 2006 to be satisfied that the Trust has made proper arrangements for securing economy, efficiency and effectiveness in its use of resources and to report where we have not been able to satisfy ourselves that it has done so. We are not required to consider, nor have we considered, whether all aspects of the Trust 's arrangements for securing economy, efficiency and effectiveness in its use of resources are operating effectively. We have undertaken our review in accordance with the Code of Audit Practice, having regard to the guidance on the specified criterion issued by the Comptroller and Auditor General in November 2017, as to whether in all significant respects, the Trust had proper arrangements to ensure it took properly informed decisions and deployed resources to achieve planned and sustainable outcomes for taxpayers and local people. The Comptroller and Auditor General determined this criterion as that necessary for us to consider under the Code of Audit Practice in satisfying ourselves whether the Trust put in place proper arrangements for securing economy, efficiency and effectiveness in its use of resources for the year ended 31 March 2019, and to report by exception where we are not satisfied. We planned our work in accordance with the Code of Audit Practice. Based on our risk assessment, we undertook such work as we considered necessary to be satisfied that the Trust has put in place proper arrangements for securing economy, efficiency and effectiveness in its use of resources. Report on other legal and regulatory requirements - Certificate We certify that we have completed the audit of the financial statements of The Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust in accordance with the requirements of Chapter 5 of Part 2 of the National Health Service Act 2006 and the Code of Audit Practice.

NHS Improvement has directed that the financial statements of NHS Foundation Trus ts shall meet the accounting requirements of the Department of Health and Social Care Group Accounting Manual (DHSC GAM), which shall be agreed with HM Treasury. Consequently, the following financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the DHS C GAM 2018/19 issued by the Department of Health and Social Care. The accounting policies contained in the DHSC GAM follow International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and HM Treasury's Financial Reporting Manual (FReM) to the extent that they are me aningful and appropriate to the NHS, as determined by HM Treasury, which is advised by the Financial Reporting Advisory Board. Where the DHSC GAM permits a choice of accounting policy, the accounting policy that is judged to be most appropriate to the part icular circumstances of the Trust for the purpose of giving a true and fair view has been selected. The particular policies adopted are described below. These have been applied consistently in dealing with items considered material in relation to the accou nts. 1.1 Accounting Convention These accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention, modified to account for the revaluation of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, inventories and certain financial assets and financial liabilities. 1.2 Going C oncern Following extensive enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Trust has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. They have identified no material uncertainties that cast significant doubt on the Trust's ability to continue as a going concern. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts. The main factors in reaching this conclusion were: As per national guidance, the Trust submitted an annual plan for 2019/20 with a forecast surplus position and is working on a five -year plan for the Trust in conjunction with the Cheshire and Merseyside area; The Trust has signed a contract with CCG's for 2019/20 activity plan and an agreed 2019/20 contract value with N HS England; Projected cash balances are sufficient to sustain the investment programme and meet short -term operating costs. The Trust has sufficient cash headroom to support its plans; The Trust has sufficient cash reserves to be able to operate for over 6 0 days if all income flows were to immediately cease; There is no expectation for short -term loans or overdraft facilities; If the Trusts efficiency target is delivered and there are no national changes to tariff (which are currently not anticipated) then it is anticipated that the Trust will continue to deliver a surplus moving into 2020/21. This would be the case even if central Provider Sustainability Funding is not received in 2020/21; 215 Auditor's opinions have provided assurance as to the accuracy and re liability of the Trust's financial systems and the robustness of the internal controls. 1.3 Consolidation The Walton Centre Charity The Trust is the corporate trustee to The Walton Centre Charity (the Charity). The Trust has assessed its relationship to the Charity and determined it to be a subsidiary because the Trust is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns and other benefit s for itself, patients and staff from its involvement with the Charity and has the ability to affect those returns and other benefits through its power over the Charity. The Charity's statutory accounts are prepared to 31 March in accordance with the UK Charities Statement of Recommended Practice (SORP) which is based on UK Financial Reporting Standard (FRS) 102. On consolidation, necessary adjustments are made to the Charity's assets, liabilities and transactions to: Recognise and measure them in accordan ce with the Trust's accounting policies; and Eliminate intra -group transactions, balances, gains and losses. 1.4 Revenue Revenue from Contrac ts with Customers Where income is derived from contracts with customers, it is accounted for under IFRS 15. The DHSC GAM expands the definition of a contract to include legislation and regulations which enables an entity to receive cash or another financial asset that is not classified as a tax by the Office of National Statistics (ONS). As directed by the DHSC GAM, the transition to IFRS 15 in 2018/19 has been completed in accordance with paragraph C3 (b) of the Standard: applying the Standard retrospectively but recognising the cumulative effects at the date of initial application (1 April 2018). In the adoption of IFRS 15 a number of practical expedients offered in the Standard have been employed. These are as follows: As per paragraph 121 of the Standard the Trust will not disclose information regarding performance obligations part of a contract that has an orig inal expected duration of one year or less; The DHSC GAM does not require the Trust to disclose information where revenue is recognised in line with the practical expedient offered in paragraph B16 of the Standard where the right to consideration correspon ds directly with value of the performance completed to date ; The DHSC GAM has mandated the exercise of the practical expedient offered in C7 (a) of the Standard that requires the Trust to reflect the aggregate effect of all contracts modified before the d ate of initial application . Revenue in respect of goods/services provided is recognised when (or as) performance obligations are satisfied by transferring promised goods/services to the customer and is measured at the amount of the transaction price allo cated to those performance obligations. At the year -end, the Trust accrues income relating to performance obligations satisfied in 216 that year. Where the Trust's entitlement to consideration for those goods or services is unconditional a contract receivable will be recognised. Where entitlement to consideration is conditional on a further factor other than the passage of time, a contract asset will be recognised. Where consideration received or receivable relates to a performance obligation that is to be sati sfied in a future period, the income is deferred and recognised as a contract liability. Revenue from NHS Contracts The main source of income for the Trust is contracts with commissioners for health care services. A performance obligation relating to del ivery of a spell of health care is generally satisfied over time as healthcare is received and consumed simultaneously by the customer as the Trust performs it. The customer in such a contract is the commissioner, but the customer benefits as services are provided to their patient. Even where a contract could be broken down into separate performance obligations, healthcare generally aligns with paragraph 22(b) of the Standard entailing a delivery of a series of goods or services that are substantially the s ame and have a similar pattern of transfer. At the year -end, the Trust accrues income relating to activity delivered in that year, where a patient care spell is incomplete. Revenue is recognised to the extent that collection of consideration is probable. Where contract challenges from commissioners are expected to be upheld, the Trust reflects this in the transaction price and derecognises the relevant portion of income. Where the Trust is aware of a penalty based on contractual performance, the Trust ref lects this in the transaction price for its recognition of revenue. Revenue is reduced by the value of the penalty. The Trust does not receive income where a patient is readmitted within 30 days of discharge from a previous planned stay. This is consider ed an additional performance obligation to be satisfied under the original transaction price. The Trust receives income from commissioners under Commissioning for Quality and Innovation (CQUIN) schemes. The Trust agrees schemes with its commissioner but they affect how care is provided to patients. That is, the CQUIN payments are not considered distinct performance obligations in their own right; instead they form part of the transaction price for performance obligations under the contract. The main source of revenue for the Trust is from NHS England (via the North West Specialised Commissioning Hub) for specialist treatment, Liverpool Clinical Commissioning Group for non -specialist services (as contract lead for the majority of non -specialis t CCG activity), Welsh Assembly for patients from Wales and from the Isle of Man, which are government funded commissioners of NHS health and patient care. Revenue from Research Contracts Where research contracts fall under IFRS 15, revenue is recognised as and when performance obligations are satisfied. For some contracts, it is assessed that the revenue project constitutes one performance obligation over the course of the multi -year contr act. In these cases it is assessed that the Trust's interim performance does not create an asset with 217 alternative use for the Trust, and the Trust has an enforceable right to payment for the performance completed to date. It is therefore considered that th e performance obligation is satisfied over time, and the Trust recognises revenue each year over the course of the contract. NHS Injury Cost Recovery Scheme The Trust receives income under the NHS injury cost recovery scheme, designed to reclaim the cost o f treating injured individuals to whom personal injury compensation has subsequently been paid, for instance by an insurer. The Trust recognises the income when it receives notification from the Department of Work and Pension's Compensation Recovery Unit, has completed the NHS2 form and confirmed there are no discrepancies with the treatment. The income is measured at the agreed tariff for the treatments provided to the injured individual, less an allowance for unsuccessful compensation claims and doubtful debts in line with IFRS 9 requirements of measuring expected credit losses over the lifetime of the asset. Revenue Grants and other Contributions to Expenditure Government grants are grants from government bodies other than income from commissioners or NHS Trusts for the provision of services. Where a grant is used to fund revenue expenditure it is taken to the Statement of Comprehensive Income to match that expenditure. The value of the benefit received when accessing funds from the Government's apprentic eship service is recognised as income at the point of receipt of the training service. Where these funds are paid directly to an accredited training provider, the corresponding notional expense is also recognised at the point of recognition for the benefit . Other Income Income from the sale of non -current assets is recognised only when all material conditions of sale have been met, and is measured as the sums due under the sale contract. Interest revenue is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and interest rate applicable. 1.5 Expenditure on Employee Benefits Short -term Employee Benefits Salaries, wages and employment -related payments such as social security costs and the apprenticeship levy are recognised in the period in which the service is received from employees. The cost of annual leave entitlement earned but not taken by employees at the end of the period is recognised in the financial statements to the extent that the employees are permitted to carry forward leave into the following period where it is deemed to be material. Pension Costs Past and present employees are covered by the provisions of the NHS Pension Scheme (the Scheme). The Scheme is an unfunded, defined benefit scheme that covers NHS employers, Gener al Practices and other bodies, allowed under the direction of the Secretary of State, in England and Wales. It is not possible for the Trust to identify its share of the underlying Scheme assets and liabilities. Therefore, the Scheme is accounted for as a defined 218 contribution scheme. The cost to the Trust of participating in the Scheme is equal to the contributions payable to the Scheme for the accounting period. Employer's pension cost contributions are charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income as and when they become due. Additional pension liabilities arising from early retirements are not funded by the Scheme except where the retirement is due to ill -health. The full amount of the liability for the additional costs is charged to the operating exp enses at the time the Trust commits itself to the retirement, regardless of the method of payment. 1.6 Expenditure on Other Goods and Services Expenditure on goods and services is recognised when, and to the extent that, they have been received and is mea sured at the fair value of those goods and services. Expenditure is recognised in operating expenses except where it results in the creation of a non -current asset such as property, plant and equipment. 1.7 Property, Plant and Equipment Recognition Property, plant and equipment is capitalised where: It is held for use in delivering services or for administrative purposes; It is probable that future economic benefits will flow to, or service potential be provided to, the Trust; It is expected to be us ed for more than one financial year; and The cost of the item can be measured reliably. The asset must: Individually have a cost of at least \u00a35,000; or Collectively have a cost of at least \u00a35,000 and individually have a cost of more than \u00a3250, where the a ssets are functionally interdependent, have broadly simultaneous purchase dates, are anticipated to have s imilar disposal dates and are under single managerial control; or Form part of the initial equipping and setting -up cost of a new building, ward or u nit irrespective of their individual or collective cost. Where a large asset, for example a building, includes a number of components with significantly different asset lives, eg, plant and equipment, then these components are treated as separate assets a nd depreciated over their own useful lives. Valuation All property, plant and equipment assets are measured initially at cost, representing the costs directly attributable to acquiring or constructing the asset and bringing it to the location and conditio n necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. All assets are measured subsequently at valuation. Land and buildings used for the Trust's services or for administrative purposes are measured subsequently at current val ue in existing use. Revaluations are performed with sufficient regularity to ensure that carrying amounts are not materially different from those that would be determined at the Statement of 219 Financial Position date. Current values in existing use are deter mined as depreciated replacement cost on a modern equivalent asset basis . Assets held at depreciated replacement cost have been valued on an alternative site basis where this would meet the location requirements of the services being provided . The freehol d properties of The Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust were valued as at 31 March 2019 by an external valuer, Gerald Eve LLP, a regulated firm of Chartered Surveyors. The valuation was prepared in accordance with the requirements of the RICS Valuation - Global Standard 2017 and the notional standards and guidance set out in RICS Valuation - Professional Standards UK (published November 2018), the International Valuation Standards, and IFRS as adapted and interpreted by the Financial Reporting Manual (FReM). The valuations of specialised properties were derived using the Depreciated Replacement Cost (DRC) method, with other in -use properties reported on a Current Value in Existing Use basis. Properties in the course of construction for service or administration purposes are carried at cost, less any impairment loss. Cost includes professional fees and, where capitalised in accordance with IAS 23, borrowing costs. Assets are revalued and deprec iation commences when they are brought into use. IT equipment, transport equipment, furniture and fittings, and plant and machinery that are held for operational use are valued at depreciated historic cost where these assets have short useful lives or low values or both, as this is not considered to be materially different from current value in existing use. An item of property, plant and equipment which is surplus with no plan to bring it back into use is valued at fair value under IFRS 13, if it does not meet the requirements of IAS 40 or IFRS 5. Subsequent Expenditure Subsequent expenditure relating to an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised as an increase in the carrying amount of the asset when it is probable that additional future economic benefits or service potential deriving from the cost incurred to replace a component of such item will flow to the enterprise and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. Where a component of an asset is replaced, the cost of the replacement is capitalised if it meets the criteria for recognition above. The carrying amount of the part replaced is de -recognised. Other expenditure that does not generate additional future economic benefits or service potential, such as repairs and maintenance is charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income in the period in which it is incurred. Depreciation Items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated over their remaining useful economic lives in a manner consistent with the consumption of economic or service delivery benefits. Freehold land is considered to have an infinite life and is not depreciated. Assets in the course of construction are not depreciated until the assets are brought into use. The estimated useful lives and residual values are r eviewed each year -end, with the effect of any changes recognised on a prospective basis. Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their estimated useful lives or, where shorter, the lease term. Property, plant and equipment which has been recl assified as 'held for sale' ceases to be depreciated upon the reclassification. 220 Revaluation Gains and Losses Revaluation gains are taken to the revaluation reserve except where, and to the extent that, they reverse a revaluation decrease for the same asset previously recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income, in which case it is credited to the Statement of Comprehensive Income. A revaluation loss is charged to the revaluation reserve to the extent that there is a balance on the reserve for the as set and, thereafter, is charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income. Gains and losses recognised in the revaluation reserve are reported in the Statement of Comprehensive Income as an item of 'other comprehensive income.' Impairments At each Statemen t of Financial Position date, the Trust reviews its tangible and intangible non-current assets to determine whether there is an indication that any have suffered impairment due to a loss of economic benefits or service potential. If there is an indication of an impairment loss, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated to determine whether there has been a loss and, if so, its amount. In accordance with the DHSC GAM, impairments that arise from a clear consumption of economic benefits or of service potential in the asset are charged to operating expenses. A compensating transfer is made from the revaluation reserve to the income and expenditure reserve of an amount equal to the lower of (i) the impairment charged to operating expenses; and (ii) the b alance in the revaluation reserve attributable to that asset before the impairment. An impairment that arises from a clear consumption of economic benefits or of service potential is reversed when, and to the extent that, the circumstances that gave rise to the loss are r eversed. Reversals are recognised in operating expenses to the extent that the asset is restored to the carrying amount it would have had if the impairment had never been recognised. Any remaining reversal is recognised in the revaluation reserve. Where, at the time of the original impairment, a transfer was made from the revaluation reserve to the income and expenditure reserve, an amount is transferred back to the revaluation reserve when the impairment reversal is recognised. Other impai rments are treated as revaluation losses. Reversals of 'other impairments' are treated as revaluation gains. Donated, Government Grant and other Grant Funded Assets Donated and grant funded property, plant and equipment assets are capitalised at their fair value on receipt. The donation/grant is credited to the Statement of Comprehensive Income at the same time, unless the donor has imposed a condition that the future economic benefits embodied in the grant are to be consumed in a manner specified by the donor, in which case, the donation/grant is deferred within liabilities and is carried forward to future financial years to the extent that the condition has not yet b een met. The donated and grant funded assets are subsequently accounted for in the same manner as other items of property, plant and equipment. 221 1.8 Intangible Assets Recognition Intangible assets are non -monetary assets without physical substance wh ich are capable of being sold separately from the rest of the Trust's business or which arise from contractual or other legal rights. They are recognised only where it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to, or service potential be provided to, the Trust and where the cost of the asset can be measured reliably. Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred and is not capitalised. Intangible assets are capitalised when they have a cost of at least \u00a35,000. Expenditure on development is capitalised only where all of the following can be demonstrated: The project is technically feasible to the point of completion and will result in an intangible asset for sale or use; The Trust intends to complete the intangible asset and sell or use it; The Trust has the ability to sell or use the intangible asset; How the intangible asset will generate probable future economic or service delivery benefits, e.g. the presence of a mar ket for it or its output, or where it is to be used for internal use, the usefulness of the asset; Adequate technical, financial and other resources are available to the Trust to complete the development and sell or use the asset; The Trust can measure r eliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development. Software which is integral to the operation of hardware, e.g. an operating system, is capitalised as part of the relevant item of property, plant and equipment. Software which is not integral to the operation of hardware, e.g. application software, is capitalised as an intangible asset. Measurement Intangible assets are recognised initially at cost, comprising all directly attributable costs needed to create, produce and prepare the asset to the point that it is capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Subsequently , intangible assets are measured at current value in existing use. Where no active market exists, intangible assets are valued at the lower of amortised replacement cost (modern equivalent asset basis) and the value in use where the asset is income generating. Revaluation gains and losses and impairments are treated in the same manner as for property, plant and equipment. An intangible asset which is surplus with no plan to bring it back into use is valued at fair value under IFRS 13, if it does not meet the requirements of IAS 40 or IFRS 5. Internally -developed software is held at historic cost to reflect the opposite effects of development costs and technological advances. Intangible assets not yet available for use are tested for impairment annually. 222 Amortisation Intangible assets are amortised over their expected useful economic lives in a manner consistent with the consumption of economic or service delivery benefits. 1.9 Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value using the first -in, first -out cost formula. This is considered to be a reasonable approximation to fair value due to the high turnover of stocks. 1.10 Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash is c ash in hand and deposits with any financial institution repayable without penalty on notice of not more than 24 hours. Cash equivalents are investments that mature in 3 months or less from the date of acquisition and that are readily convertible to known a mounts of cash with insignificant risk of change in value. In the Statement of Cash Flows, cash and cash equivalents are shown net of any bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and that form an integral part of the Trust's cash management. Cash, bank and any overdraft balances are recorded at current values. 1.11 Financial Instruments and Financial Liabilities Recognition Financial assets and financial liabilities arise where the Trust is party to the contractual provisions of a financial instrument , and as a result has a legal right to receive or a legal obligation to pay cash or another financial instrument. The DHSC GAM expands the definition of a contract to include legislation and regulations which give rise to arrangements that in all other res pects would be a financial instrument and do not give rise to transactions classified as a tax by ONS. This includes the purchase or sale of non -financial items (such as goods or services), which are entered into in accordance with the Trust's normal purch ase, sale or usage requirements and are recognised when, and to the extent which, performance occurs, ie, when receipt or delivery of the goods or services is made. Classification and Measurement Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value plus or minus directly attributable transaction costs except where the asset or liability is not measured at fair value through income and expenditure. Fair value is taken as the transaction price, or otherwise determined by referenc e to quoted market prices or valuation techniques . Financial assets or financial liabilities in respect of assets acquired or disposed of through finance leases are recognised and measured in accordance with the accounting policy for leases described below . Financial assets are classified as subsequently measured at amortised cost, fair value through income and expenditure or fair value through other comprehensive income. 'Amortised cost' and 'fair value through other comprehensive income' are the only cate gories relevant to the Trust. 223 Financial liabilities classified as subsequently measured at amortised cost or fair value through income and expenditure. All of the Trust's financial liabilities are categorised as subsequently measured at 'amortised cost. ' Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities at Amortised Cost Financial assets and financial liabilities at amortised cost are those held with the objective of collecting contractual cash flows and where cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest. This includes cash equivalents, contract and other receivables, trade and other payables, rights and obligations under lease arrangements and loans receivable and payable. After initial recognition, these financial assets and financial liabilities ar e measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment (for financial assets). The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financi al asset or financial liability to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset or to the amortised cost of a financial liability. Interest revenue or expense is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset or amortised cost of a financial liability and recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income and a financing income or expense. In the case of loans held from the Department of Health and Social Care, the effective interest rate is the nominal rate of interest charged on the loan. Financial Assets Measured at Fair Value through other Comprehensive Income The Trust has ir revocably elected to measure the equity investments held by the Charity at fair value through other comprehensive income. Impairment of Financial Assets For all financial assets measured at amortised cost including l ease receivables , contract receivables and contract assets, the Trust recognises a n allowance for expected credit losses. The Trust adopts the simplified approach to impairment for contract and other receivables, contract assets and lease receivables, measuring expected losses as at an amount equal to lifetime expected losses. For other financial assets, the loss allowance is initially measured at an amount equal to 12 -month expected credit losses (stage 1) and subsequently at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses if the credit ris k assessed for the financial asset significantly increases (stage 2). HM Treasury has ruled that central government bodies may not recognise stage 1 or stage 2 impairments against other government departments, their executive agencies, the Bank of England, Exchequer Funds, and Exchequer Funds' assets where repayment is ensured by primary legislation. The Trust therefore does not recognise loss allowances for stage 1 or stage 2 impairments against these bodies. Additionally, the Department of Health and Soci al Care provides a guarantee of last resort against the debts of its arm's length bodies and NHS bodies (excluding NHS charities), and the Trust does not recognise loss allowances for stage 1 or stage 2 impairments against these bodies. For financial assets that have become credit impaired since initial recognition (stage 3), expected credit losses at the reporting date are measured as the difference between the 224 asset's gross carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future c ash flows discounted at the financial asset's original effective interest rate. Expected losses are charged to operating expenditure within the Statement of Comprehensive Income and reduce the net carrying value of the financial asset in the Statement of Financial Position. De-recognition Financial assets are de -recognised when the contractual rights to receive cash flows from the assets have expired or the Trust has transferred substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership. Financial liabilities are de -recognised when the obligation has been discharged, cancelled or expires. 1.12 Leases Leases are classified as finance leases when substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases. Finance Leases Where substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of a leased asset are borne by the Trust, the asset is recorded as property, plant and equipment and a corresponding liability is recorded. The value at which both are recognised is the lower of the fa ir value of the asset or the present value of the minimum lease payments, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. The asset and liability are recognised at the commencement of the lease. Thereafter the asset is accounted for as an item o f property plant and equipment. The annual rental is split between the repayment of the liability and a finance cost so as to achieve a constant rate of finance over the life of the lease. The annual finance cost is charged to Finance Costs in the Stateme nt of Comprehensive Income. The lease liability is de-recognised when the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires. Operating Leases Other leases are regarded as operating leases and the rentals are charged to operating expenses on a straight -line bas is over the term of the lease. Lease incentives are recognised initially as a liability and subsequently as a reduction of rentals on a straight - line basis over the lease term. Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight -line basis over the term of the lease. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised as an expense on a straight -line basis over the lease term. 1.13 Provisions The Trust recognises a provision where it has a present legal or constructive obligation of uncertain timing or amount; for which it is probable that there will be a future outflow of cash or other resources; and a reliable estimate can be made of the amou nt. The amount recognised in the Statement of Financial Position is the best estimate of the resources 225 required to settle the obligation. Where the effect of the time value of money is significant, the estimated risk -adjusted cash flows are discounted usin g the discount rates published and mandated by HM Treasury. Early retirement provisions are discounted using HM Treasury's pension discount rate of positive 0.29% (2017 -18: positive 0.10%) in real terms. Clinical Negligence Costs NHS Resolution operates a risk pooling scheme under which the Trust pays an annual contribution to NHS Resolution , which, in return, settles all clinical negligence claims. The contribution is charged to the Statement of Com prehensive Income. Although NHS Resolution is administratively responsible for all clinical negligence cases , the legal liability remains with the Trust. The total value of clinical negligence provisions carried by NHS Resolution on behalf of the Trust is disclosed in Note 18 but is not recognised in the Trust's accounts. The excess on these claims payable by the Trust is included in the accounts and disclosed in Note 18 as 'other legal claims.' Non-clinical Risk Pooling The Trust participates in the Property Expenses Scheme and the Liabilities to Th ird Parties Scheme. Both are risk pooling schemes under which the Trust pays an annual contribution to NHS Resolution and, in return, receives assistance with the costs of claims arising. The annual membership contributions, and any 'excesses' payable in r espect of particular claims are charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income when the liability arises. 1.14 Contingencies Contingent assets (that is, assets arising from past events whose existence will only be confirmed by one or more future events not wholly within the entity's control) are not recognised as assets , but are disclosed in Note 20 where an inflow of economic benefits is probable. Contingent liabilities are not recognised, but are disclosed in Note 20, unless the probability of a transfer of economic benefits is remote. Contingent liabilities are defined as: Possible obligations arising from past events whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the entity's control; or Present obligations arising from past events but for which it is not probable that transfer of economic benefits will arise or for which the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability. 1.15 Public Dividend Capital Public dividend capital (PDC) is a type of public sector equity finance based on the excess of assets over liabilities at the time of the establishment of the predecessor NHS Trust. HM Treasury has determined that, being iss ued under statutory authority rather than under contract, PDC is not a financial instrument within the meaning of IAS 32. At any time, the Secretary of State can issue new PDC to, and require repayments of PDC from, the Trust. PDC is recorded at the value received. A charge, reflecting the forecast cost of capital utilised by the Trust, is paid over as public 226 dividend capital dividend. The charge is calculated at the real rate set by HM Treasury (currently 3.5%) on the average relevant net assets of the Tru st during the financial year. Relevant net assets are calculated as the value of all assets less the value of all liabilities, except for: Donated assets (including lottery funded assets); Average daily cash balances held with the Government Banking Services (GBS) and National Loans Fund (NLF) deposits, excluding cash balances held in GBS accounts that relate to a short -term working capital facility; Any PSF incentive and PSF bonus fund receivable; and Any PDC dividend balance receivable or payable. The average relevant net assets is calculated as a simple average of opening and closing relevant net assets. In accordance with the requirements laid down by the Department of Health and Social Care (as the issuer of PDC), the dividend for the year is cal culated on the actual average relevant net assets as set out in the 'pre -audit' version of the annual accounts. The dividend thus calculated is not revised should any adjustment to net assets occur as a result the audit of the annual accounts. 1.16 Value A dded Tax Most of the activities of the Trust are outside the scope of VAT and, in general, output tax does not apply and input tax on purchases is not recoverable. Irrecoverable VAT is charged to the relevant expenditure category or included in the capita lised purchase cost of fixed assets. Where output tax is charged or input VAT is recoverable, the amounts are stated net of VAT. 1.17 Corporation Tax HM Treasury has decided to defer the planned implementation of legislation requiring NHS Foundation Trus ts to pay corporation tax on profits generated on their commercial activities. As a result, NHS Foundation Trusts will not become taxable on their profits. This may change with future Government legislation. 1.18 Foreign Currencies The Trust operates and accounts for its transactions in sterling. Transactions denominated in a foreign currency are translated into sterling at the spot exchange rate on the date of the transaction. Resulting exchange gains and losses are taken to the Statement of Comprehensiv e Income. At the Statement of Financial Position date, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the Statement of Financial Position date. 1.19 Third Party Assets Assets belonging to third parties (such as money held on behalf of patients) are not recognised in the accounts since the Trust has no beneficial interest in them. However, details of third party assets are given in Note 27 to the accounts in accordance wi th the requirements of HM Treasury's FReM . 1.20 Losses and Special Payments Losses and Special Payments are items that Parliament would not have contemplated when it agreed funds for the health service or passed legislation. By their nature they are item s that ideally should not arise. They are therefore subject to special control procedures 227 compared with the generality of payments. They are divided into different categories, which govern the way each individual case is handled. Losses and Special Paymen ts are charged to the relevant functional headings in the Statement of Comprehensive Income on an accruals basis, including losses which would have been made good through insurance cover had NHS Trusts not been bearing their own risks (with insurance premi ums then being included as normal revenue expenditure). Note 29 on Losses and Special Payments is compiled directly from the Losses and Compensations Register which is prepared on a cash basis . 1.21 Critical Accounting Judgements and Key Sources of Estim ation In the application of the Trust's accounting policies, management is required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and asso ciated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from those estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are continually reviewed. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods. Critical Judgements in Applying Accounting Policies In the process of applying the Trust's accounting policies, management has not been required to make any judgements, apart from those involving estimations, which has had a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial s tatements. Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty The following are the key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the Statement of Financial Position date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year. Valuation and impairment of non -financial assets - the Trust assesses whether there are any indicators of impairment for all non -financial assets at each reporting date. The key area of uncertainty relates to the Trust's valuation of its land and buildings. Further details are provided in Note 11. The land and buildings were valued by Gerald Eve LLP as at 31 March 2019. 1.22 Operating Segments The Trust is the UK's only specialist neurological centre and sees patients with neurological associated conditions referred from all over the country. Contracts for services are negotiated with commissioners and monitored on the basis of point of delivery, inpatients, outpatients etc. The services provided by the Trust are interdependent and therefore the Board considers that the Trust operates as a single segment. 228 1.23 Accounting Standards that have been Issued but have not yet been Adopted The DH GAM does not re quire the following Standards and Interpretations to be applied in 2018/19.

Details of the benefits payable and rules of the Schemes can be found on the NHS Pensions website at www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/pensions . Both are unfunded defined benefit schemes that cover NHS employers, GP practices and other bodies, allowed under the direction of the Secretary of State for Health in England and W ales. They are not designed to be run in a way that would enable NHS bodies to identify their share of the underlying scheme assets and liabilities. Therefore, each scheme is accounted for as if it were a defined contribution scheme: the cost to the NHS bo dy of participating in each scheme is taken as equal to the contributions payable to that scheme for the accounting period. In order that the defined benefit obligations recognised in the financial statements do not differ materially from those that woul d be determined at the reporting date by a formal actuarial valuation, the FReM requires that 'the period between formal valuations shall be four years, with approximate assessments in intervening years .' An outline of these follows: a) Accounting Valuatio n A valuation of scheme liability is carried out annually by the scheme actuary (currently the Government Actuary's Department) as at the end of the reporting period. This utilises an actuarial assessment for the previous accounting period in conjunction w ith updated membership and financial data for the current reporting period, and is accepted as providing suitably robust figures for financial reporting purposes. The valuation of the scheme liability as at 31 March 2019, is based on valuation data as 31 M arch 2018, updated to 31 March 2019 with summary global member and accounting data. In undertaking this actuarial assessment, the methodology prescribed in IAS 19, relevant FReM interpretations, and the discount rate prescribed by HM Treasury have also bee n used. The latest assessment of the liabilities of the scheme is contained in the report of the scheme actuary, which forms part of the annual NHS Pension Scheme Accounts. These 234 accounts can be viewed on the NHS Pensions website and are published annually . Copies can also be obtained from The Stationery Office. b) Full Actuarial ( Funding) Valuation The purpose of this valuation is to assess the level of liability in respect of the benefits due under the schemes (taking into account recent demographic exper ience), and to recommend contribution rates payable by employees and employers. The latest actuarial valuation undertaken for the NHS Pension Scheme was completed as at 31 March 2016. The results of this valuation set the employer contribution rate payabl e from April 2019. The Department of Health and Social Care have recently laid Scheme Regulations confirming that the employer contribution rate will increase to 20.6% of pensionable pay from this date. The 2016 funding valuation was also expected to tes t the cost of the Scheme relative to the employer cost cap set following the 2012 valuation. Following a judg ement from the Court of Appeal in December 2018 Government announced a pause to that part of the valuation process pending conclusion of the contin uing legal process.

Note 2 2 Capital Commitments At 31 March 2019 the Trust had capital commitments of \u00a31,103 ,000 (31 March 201 8: \u00a3280,572 ) in relation to contractual commitments for capital items. 245 Note 2 3.1 Financial i nstruments Financial reporting standard IFRS 7 requires disclosure of the role that financial instruments have had during the period in creating or changing the risks a body faces in undertaking its activities. Because of the continuing service provider relationship that the Trust has with its commiss ioners and the way those commissioners are financed, the Trust is not exposed to the degree of financial risk faced by business entities. Also, financial instruments play a much more limited role in creating or changing risk than would be typical of listed companies, to which the financial reporting standards mainly apply. The Trust has considered its exposure to the following financial risks: Currency Risk - the Trust has no overseas operations and the majority of transactions are sterling based. Foreign currency transactions arise from purchases of equipment and supplies from overseas providers and a small proportion of charitable investments. However, the se are not significant in value or number of transactions and the Trust therefore has low exposure to currency rate fluctuations; Interest Rate Risk - the Trust has loans for its capital expansion programme. However, these are at fixed rates with the Independent Trust Financing Facility . The Trust therefore has low exposure to interest rate fluctuations; Credit Risk - the majority of the Trust's revenue is from contracts with other public sector bodies. The Trust holds significant cash balances but these are also held through the Government Banking Service. Therefore the Trust has low exposure to credit risk. The C harity uses a commercial bank but its cash balances are not material to the Group. The Charity's investments are managed through external investment managers. Investments are held in UK multi -asset pooled charity funds. The maximum exposure on receivables at 31 March 201 9 is disclosed in Note 14.1 Trade Receivables and Other Receivables ; and Liquidity Risk - the Trust's operating costs are incurred principally under contracts with commissioners. Capital expenditure is funded principally for the provision of public sector services. The Trust is not exposed to significant liquidity risk. Note 2 3.2 Fair Value of Non -current Financial A ssets The Charity held investments at 31 March 201 9 with a fair value of \u00a3 970,933 (31 March 2018: \u00a3812,365). The book value of these assets is \u00a3 999,999 (31 March 201 8: \u00a368 2,204). 246 Note 23.3 Carrying Values of Financial Assets by Category Foundation Trust Group Total carrying value Held at amortised cost Total Held at amortised cost Held at fair value through OCI \u00a3000 \u00a3000 \u00a3000 \u00a3000 \u00a3000 Carrying values of financial assets as at 31 March 2019 under IFRS 9 Trade and other receivables (excluding non -financial assets) - with NHS and DHSC bodies 7,555 7,555 7,555 7,555 0 Trade and other receivables (excluding non -financial assets) - with other bodies 3,389 3,389 3,385 3,385 0 Cash and cash equivalents at bank and in hand 21,713 21,713 21,713 21,713 0 Consolidated NHS charitable fund financial assets 0 0 1,516 545 971 Total as at 31 March 2019 32,657 32,657 34,169 33,198 971 Total carrying value Loans and receivables Total Loans and receivables Available for sale \u00a3000 \u00a3000 \u00a3000 \u00a3000 \u00a3000 Carrying values of financial assets as at 31 March 2018 under IAS 39 Trade and other receivables (excluding non -financial assets) - with NHS and DHSC bodies 5,511 5,511 5,511 5,511 0 Trade and other receivables (excluding non -financial assets) - with other bodies 2,006 2,006 1,988 1,988 0 Cash and cash equivalents at bank and in hand 17,169 17,169 17,169 17,169 0 Consolidated NHS charitable fund financial assets 0 0 1,337 525 812 Total as at 31 March 2018 24,686 24,686 26,005 25,193 812 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments is applied retrospectively from 1 April 2018 without restatement of comparatives.

The standard is applied retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initial application recognised as an adjustment to reserves on 1 April 2018. IFRS 9 replaces IAS 39 and introduces a revised approach to clas sification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities, a new forward -looking 'expected loss' impairment model and a revised approach to hedge accounting. Under IFRS 9, borrowings from the Department of Health and Social Care, which were previously held at historic cost, are measured on an amortised cost basis. Consequently, on 1 April 2018 borrowings increased by \u00a3200k, and trade payables correspondingly reduced. The DHSC GAM expands the definition of a contract in the context of financia l instruments to include legislation and regulations, except where this gives rise to a tax. Receivables relating to Injury Cost Recovery are classified as a financial asset measured at amortised cost. 248 Note 24.2 Initial Application of IFRS 15 IFRS 15 Reve nue from Contracts with Customers as interpreted and adapted by the DHSC GAM has been applied by the Trust from 1 April 2018. The standard is applied retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initial application recognised as an adjustment to the incom e and expenditure reserve on 1 April 2018 where relevant. IFRS 15 introduces a new model for the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers replacing the previous standards IAS 11, IAS 18 and related Interpretations. The core principle of IFRS 15 is that an entity recognises revenue when it satisfies performance obligations through the transfer of promised goods or services to customers at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. As directed by the DHSC GAM, the Trust has applied the practical expedient offered in C7 (a) of the standard removing the need to retrospectively restate any contract modifications that occurred before the date of implementation (1 Apri l 2018). Note 2 5 Events after the Statement of Financial P osition Date The Directors are not aware of any event after the Statement of Financial Position date and up to the date that the financial statements were approved which will affect the accounts. Note 26 Public Dividend Capital NHS Trusts are required to pay a dividend of 3.5% of their average net relevant assets to the Department of Health. This is calculated on a full financial year. The dividend is payable in two instalments in September and March . Note 2 7 Third Party B alances At 31 March 201 9 the Trust held \u00a3928 on behalf of patients (31 March 201 8: \u00a3916). Note 2 8 Related P arty Transactions The Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust is a public interest body authorised by NHS Improvement, the Independent Regulator for NHS Foundation Trusts. During the period none o f the Board members or members of the key management staff, or parties related to them, has undertaken any material transactions with The Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust. The Department of Health and Social Care is a related party as the parent department of the Trust. During the period The Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust has had a significant number of material transactions with the Department, and with other entities for which the Department is regarded as the parent Department. These entities are listed below: NHS England; and Broadgreen University Hospitals NHS Trust; and 249 NHS Resolution . In addition the Trust has had material transactions with the fo llowing central government body: Welsh Assembly Government including all Welsh Health bodies. In 2012/13, Liverpool Health Partners L imited , a company limited by guarantee, was set up between the University of Liverpool, Aintree University Hospital NHS F oundatio n Trust, Alder Hey NHS Trust, The Clatterbridge Cancer Centre NHS F oundation Trust, Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen University Hospitals NHS Trust, Liverpool Women's NHS F oundation Trust, The Walton Centre NHS F oundation Trust, Liverpo ol Heart and Chest NHS F oundation Trust and Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine. The objects of the company are to advance education, health, learning and research by facilitating world class research among the partners. Each organisation has a single sh are in the company and the Chief Executives are ex -officio directors of the company. A contribution of \u00a382,000 (2017/18: \u00a380,000) was made to the company to enable it to carry out its objectives. The Trust's Council of Governors comprise 17 elected Governo rs, 4 staff Governors and 12 appointed Partnership Governors. Governors are drawn from a range of stakeholders including patient groups, neurological charities, research and academic groups, CCGs, Local Authorities, NHS England and Wales. Therefore, many, by the nature of their appoi ntment, have interests in organisations with whom the Trust contracts. A register of interests is maintained and declarations of interests are given at each Governor meeting. Since 2013/14 the Trust has included T he Walton Centre Charity as a subsidiary because the Trust has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the Fund so as to obtain benefits from its activities for itself, its patients or its staff. Transactions between the Trust and the Charity are not material and are eliminated on con solidation. Assets held by the C harity are to be used for charitable purposes only. The financial activity of the Charity during 201 8/19 and its balance sheet at 31 March 201 9 are summarised as: 250 Summary statement of financial activities 2017/18 2018/19 \u00a3'000 \u00a3'000 Operating income (incoming resources excluding investment income) 466 698 Operating expenditure (544) (541) Net (outgoing)/incoming resources before other recognised gains and losses (78) 157 Fair value gains/(losses) on financial assets mandated at fair value through OCI (15) 0 Fair value gains/(losses) on equity instruments designated at fair value through OCI 0 17 Net movement in funds (93) 174 Summary balance sheet 31-Mar-18 31-Mar-19 \u00a3'000 \u00a3'000 Non-current assets Other investments/financial assets 812 971 Total non -current assets 812 971 Current assets Receivables 15 27 Cash and cash equivalents 525 545 Total current assets 540 572 Current liabilities Trade and other payables (59) (76) Total current liabilities (59) (76) Total net assets 1,293 1,467 Unrestricted funds 1,293 1,467 Total funds 1,293 1,467 Note 2 9 Losses and Special P ayments During the period the Trust made 7 (2017/18: 17) special payments with a total value of \u00a36,243 (2017/18: \u00a327,916). Of these \u00a35,691 (2017/18: \u00a323,057) related to payments in respect of 3 (2017/18: 5) claims by third parties which are handled by NHS Resolution . The Trust also wrote off 12 (2017/18: 5) debts with a total value of \u00a3842 (2017/18: \u00a337,292). No items of stock were written off due to loss, damage or expiry (2017/18: \u00a326,677). 251 Independent Practitioner's Limited Assurance Report to the Council of Governors of The Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust on the Quality Report We have been engaged by the Council of Governors of The Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust to perform an independent limited assurance engagement in respect of The Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust's Quality Report for the year ended 31 March 2019 (the \"Quality Report\") and certain performance indicators contained therein against the criteria set out in the 'NHS foundation trust annual reporting manual 2018/19' and additi onal supporting guidance in the 'Detailed requirements for quality reports 2018/19' (the 'Criteria'). Scope and subject matter The indicators for the year ended 31 March 2019 subject to the limited assurance engagement consist of the national priority indi cators as mandated by NHS Improvement: Maximum waiting time of 62 days from urgent GP referral to first treatment for all cancers Percentage of incomplete pathways within 18 weeks for patients on incomplete pathways at the end of the reporting period We refer to these national priority indicators collectively as \"the indicators\". Respective responsibilities of the directors and Practitioner The directors are responsible for the content and the preparation of the Quality Report in accordance with the criteria set out in the 'NHS foundation trust annual reporting manual 2018/19' and supporting guidance issued by NHS Improvement. Our responsibility is to form a conclusion, based on limited assurance procedures, on whether anything has come to our attenti on that causes us to believe that: the Quality Report is not prepared in all material respects in line with the Criteria set out in the 'NHS foundation trust annual reporting manual 2018/19' and supporting guidance; the Quality Report is not consistent in all material respects with the sources specified in NHS Improvement's 'Detailed requirements for external assurance for quality reports 2018/19'; and the indicators in the Quality Report identified as having been the subject of limited assurance in t he Quality Report are not reasonably stated in all material respects in accordance with the 'NHS foundation trust annual reporting manual 2018/19' and supporting guidance and the six dimensions of data quality set out in the ''Detailed requirements for ext ernal assurance for quality reports 2018/19'. We read the Quality Report and consider whether it addresses the content requirements of the 'NHS foundation trust annual reporting manual 2018/19' and supporting guidance, and consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any material omissions. We read the other information contained in the Quality Report and consider whether it is materially inconsistent with: Board minutes for the period 1 April 2018 to 24 May 2019; papers relating to qu ality reported to the Board over the period 1 April 2018 to 24 May 2019; feedback from commissioners dated 19, 20 and 22 May 2019; feedback from governors dated 11 December 2018 and 7 March 2019 feedback from local Healthwatch organisations dated 15, 16 and 17 May 2019; 252 the Trust's complaints report published under regulation 18 of the Local Authority, Social Services and National Health Service Complaints (England) Regulations 2009, dated 23 May 2019; the national patient survey dated 13 June 2018; the national staff survey dated 28 March 2019; the Head of Internal Audit's annual opinion over the Trust's control environment dated 16 April 2019; the Care Quality Commission's inspection report dated 21 October 2016. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with these documents (collectively the \"documents\"). Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information. The firm applies Intern ational Standard on Quality Control 1 (Revised) and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. We are in compliance with the applicable independence and competency requirements of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW) Code of Ethics. Our team comprised assurance practitioners and relevant subje ct matter experts. This report, including the conclusion, has been prepared solely for the of Governors of The Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust as a body, to assist the Council of Governors in reporting The Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust's quality ag enda, performance and activities. We permit the disclosure of this report within the Annual Report for the year ended 31 March 2019, to enable the Council of Governors to demonstrate they have discharged their governance responsibilities by commissioning a n independent assurance report in connection with the indicators. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Council of Governors as a body, and The Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust for our work or this report, except where terms are expressly agreed and with our prior consent in writing. Assurance work performed We conducted this limited assurance engagement in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (Revised) ' Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information' issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board ('ISAE 3000'). Our limited assurance procedures included: evaluating the design and implementation of the key processes and controls for managing and reporting the indicators; making enquiries of management; limited testing, on a selective basis, of the data used to calculate the indicators tested against supporting documentation; comparing the co ntent requirements of the 'NHS foundation trust annual reporting manual 2018/19' and supporting guidance to the categories reported in the Quality Report; and reading the documents. A limited assurance engagement is narrower in scope than a reasonable as surance engagement. The nature, timing and extent of procedures for gathering sufficient appropriate evidence are deliberately limited relative to a reasonable assurance engagement. Limitations Non-financial performance information is subject to more inher ent limitations than financial information, given the characteristics of the subject matter and the methods used for determining such information. 253 The absence of a significant body of established practice on which to draw allows for the selection of diffe rent, but acceptable, measurement techniques that can result in materially different measurements and can affect comparability. The precision of different measurement techniques may also vary. Furthermore, the nature and methods used to determine such info rmation, as well as the measurement criteria and the precision of these criteria, may change over time. It is important to read the Quality Report in the context of the criteria set out in the 'NHS foundation trust annual reporting manual 2018/19' and supp orting guidance. The scope of our limited assurance work has not included governance over quality or non -mandated indicators, which have been determined locally by The Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust. Our audit work on the financial statements of The Wa lton Centre NHS Foundation Trust is carried out in accordance with our statutory obligations and is subject to separate terms and conditions. This engagement will not be treated as having any effect on our separate duties and responsibilities as The Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust's external auditors. Our audit reports on the financial statements are made solely to The Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust's members, as a body, in accordance with paragraph 24(5) of Schedule 7 of the National Health Service Act 2006. Our audit work is undertaken so that we might state to The Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust's members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. Our audits of The Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust's financial statements are not planned or conducted to address or reflect matters in which anyone other than such members as a body may be interested for such purpose. In these circumstances, to the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume any responsibility to anyone other than The Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust and The Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust's members as a body, for our audit work, for our audit reports, or for the opinions we have formed in respect of those audit s. Conclusion Based on the results of our procedures, as described in this report, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that, for the year ended 31 March 2019: the Quality Report is not prepared in all material respects in line with the Criteria set out in the 'NHS foundation trust annual reporting manual 2018/19' and supporting guidance; the Quality Report is not consistent in all material respects with the sourc es specified in NHS Improvement's 'Detailed requirements for external assurance for quality reports 2018/19'; and the indicators in the Report identified as having been subject to limited assurance have not been reasonably stated in all material respects in accordance with the 'NHS foundation trust annual reporting manual 2018/19' and supporting guidance.
