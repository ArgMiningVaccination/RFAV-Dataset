My oldest child, whom my husband tried for years to get pregnant with, was vaccine injured as an infant. Had her pediatrician been forward and honest with me, and truly given me the informed consent that both my daughter and I deserved, maybe she wouldn't have been injured. She suers from seizures, a tic disorder, and brain damage that her neurologist has conrmed is the result of vaccine damage. The guilt that I carry everyday is so incredibly heavy. I did not know that vaccines came with the risk of negative side eects and her pediatrician nor the nurses in the oce informed me of that. Parents and children deserve better. Parents should be informed of the risks and should be oered the vaccine manufacturers inserts when making the decision on what medications their children will be receiving. I am asking you, as someone whose child suered as a result of the lack of informed consent, to support this bill. Thank "}
