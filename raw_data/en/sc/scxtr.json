SMP Template: December 2020 Site Management Plan, Site # C241214 11 1.0 Introduction 1.1 General This Site Management Plan (SMP) is a required element of the remedial program for the 37- 24 & 37- 28 30th Street Redevelopment Site located in Long Island City, New York (hereinafter referred to as the \"Site\") . See Figure 1. The Site is currently in the New York State (NYS) Brownfield Cleanup Program (BCP) , Site No. C241214, which is administered by New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC or Department ). 31st Avenue Associates LLC and 37- 26 30th Street LLC entered into a Brownfield Cleanup Agreement (BCA) on September 17, 2018 with the NYSDEC to remediate the site. A figure showing the site location and boundaries of this site is provided in Figure 2. The boundaries of the site are more fully described in the metes and bounds site description that is part of the Environmental Easement provided in Appendix A . After completion of the remedial work, some contamination was left at this site, which is hereafter referred to as \"remaining contamination\" . Institutional and Engineering Controls (ICs and ECs) have been incorporated into the site remedy to control exposure to remaining contamination to ensure protection of public health and the environment . An Environmental Easement , granted to the NYSDEC, require s compliance with this SMP and all ECs and ICs placed on the site . The environmental easement for the site was recorded in the Office of the City Register o f the City of New York (City Register File No. 2021000441699). A copy of the easement and proof of filing are included in Appendix A. This SMP was prepared to manage remaining contamination at the site until the Environmental Easement is extinguished in accordance with ECL Article 71, Title 36. This plan has been approved by the NYSDEC, and compliance with this plan is required by the grantor of the Environmental Easement and the grantor's successors and assigns . This SMP may only be revis ed with the approval of the NYSDEC. It is important to note that: This SMP details the site -specific implementation procedures that are required by the Environmental Easement . Failure to properly implement the SMP is a violation of the Environmental Easem ent, which is grounds for revocation of the Certificate of Completion (COC); SMP Template: December 2020 Site Management Plan, Site # C241214 12 Failure to comply with this SMP is also a violation of Environmental Conservation Law, 6 NYCRR Part 375 and the BCA (Index # C241214- 08-13; Site # C241214) for the site, and there by subject to applicable penalties. All reports associated with the site can be viewed by contacting the NYSDEC or its successor agency managing environmental issues in New York State. A list of contacts for persons involved with the site is provided in Ap pendix B of this SMP. This SMP was prepared by GEI , on behalf of 31st Avenue Associates LLC and 37- 26 30th Street LLC , in accordance with the requirements of the NYSDEC's DER -10 (\"Technical Guidance for Site Investigation and Remediation\"), dated May 2010, and the guidelines provided by the NYSDEC . This SMP addresses the means for implementing the ICs and/or ECs that are required by the Environmental Easement for the site. 1.2 Revisions Revisions to this plan will be proposed in writing to the NYSDEC's project manager . The NYSDEC can also make changes to the SMP or request revisions from the remedial party. Revisions will be necessary upon, but not limited to, the following occurr ing: a change in media monitoring requirements, upgrades to or shutdown of a remedial system, post -remedial removal of contaminated sediment or soil, or other significant change to the site conditions.

SMP Template: December 2020 Site Management Plan, Site # C241214 15 2.0 Summary of Previous Investigations and Remedial Actions 2.1 Site Location and Description The site is located in Long Island City, Queens County, New York and is identified as Block 371 and Lot s 33 and 34 on the New York City Tax Map (see Figure 1). The site is an approximately 0.368- acre area and is bounded by a two -story office building to the north, an auto repair shop and two residential houses to the south, 30th Street to the east, and Old Ridge Road to the west (see Figure 2 - Site Map). The boundaries of the site are more fully described in Appendix A - Environmental Easement , Survey, Metes and Bounds . The owner(s) of the site parcel(s) at the time of issuance of this SMP is 37-26 30th Street LLC . 2.2 Physical Setting 2.2.1 Land Use The Site consists of the following: two partially constructed 7- story residential buildings . The Site is zoned M1 -2/R6A (mixed industrial and residential) and is currently undergoing redevelopment for residential use . Site occupants include construction contractors . The properties adjoining the Site and in the neighborhood surrounding the Site primarily include industrial and residential properties . The properties immediately south of the Site include industrial and residential properties; the properties immediately north of the Site include industrial properties; the properties immediately east of the Site include industrial properties; and the properties to the west of the Site include industrial properties. 2.2.2 Geology and Hydrogeology Based on the g eotechnical report provided by GTA and the RI performed by GEI , the subsurface conditions consist of historic fill soils, glacial outwash sand deposits, and bedrock. A fill layer consisting of soils mixed with construction debris was identified Site - wide extending to a depth of approximately 3- ft. bgs. Native soils were present beneath the fill layer, consisting of fine to medium sand and silt with varying percentages of gravel, and occasional cobbles and boulders. Weathered bedrock was encountered at de pths SMP Template: December 2020 Site Management Plan, Site # C241214 16 varying from approximately 47- to 74- ft. bgs. Site specific boring logs are provided in Appendix C . No evidence of perched water was observed during the RI. Based upon regional topography, groundwater was presumed to flow in a northwesterly direction toward the East River. Water level measurements collected during the RI indicated flow in a westerly direction. Groundwater levels measured in the monitoring wells located on- Site varied between approximately 26- to 29- ft. bgs. A groundwater contour map developed from data collected during the RI is shown in Figure 3. A groundwater contour map developed from data collected following implementation of the RAWP is shown in Figure 4 . Groundwater monitoring well construction logs ar e provided in Appendix D . 2.3 Investigation and Remedial History The following narrative provides a remedial history timeline and a brief summary of the available project records to document key investigative and remedial milestones for the Site. Full titles for each of the reports referenced below are provided in Section 8.0 - References. Historic Sanborn Maps show that the Site was occupied by a residential building from at least 1898 until it was replaced with a two- and one -story commercial structure with partial basement on Tax Lot 34 constructed circa 1936. The one -story commercial structure formerly located on Tax Lot 33 was constructed circa 1947. Historic use of the Site includes manufacturing metal products and plastics (approx. 1947 -1970), carpet cleaning (approx. 1967 -1970), printing (approx. 1983- 1991), dry cleaning (approx. 1996 to 2018), and auto repair (approx. 2000 to 2018). Until August 2018, the Site was used for two commercial dry -cleaning businesses and one auto repair business and contained three separate tenant spaces. The Site features included a one -story structure with partial two -story section and partial basement located within the auto repair business parcel, which is approximately 400- square feet in size. The auto repair shop, Millennium Auto Collision, occupied half of Tax Lot 34 with the physical address of 37- 28 30th Street; the first dry- cleaner, Enterprise Cleaners, occupied the remaining half of Tax Lot 34, with the physical address of 37- 26 30th Street; and the second dry-cleaner, Season Wash, occupied Tax Lot 33, with the physical address of 37- 24 30th SMP Template: December 2020 Site Management Plan, Site # C241214 17 Street. As of August 2018, the Site had been purchased and all tenants had vacated the properties. Four investigations and one Interim Remedial Measure (IRM) were conducted at the Site. The reports describing these investigations and the IRM are listed below. Each report is summarized in the following subsections. Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (ESA), prepared by Hillman Consulting, dated April 2017; Phase II ESA, prepared by Athenica Environmental Services, Inc., dated June 2017; Subsurface geotechnical report , prepared by GTA Engineering Services of New York, P.C., dated November 2018; and Remedial Investigation Report , prepared by GEI, dated January 2020. Interim Remedial Measure Construction Completion Report, prepared by GEI, dated November 2021. 2.3.1 April 2017 Phase I ESA A Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) was completed in April 2017 by Hillman Consulting for the properties located at 37- 24 and 37- 28 30th Street, Long Island City, New York. The assessment included a site inspection, historical research, and a regulatory review of the properties. The report identified and discussed the Sanborn maps associated with the properties. The part ial basement of the auto repair business was unable to be accessed during conduction of this Phase I. Recognized Environmental Conditions (RECs) were identified by Hillman associated with the property use (historic and present), the previously identified f ive aboveground storage tanks (ASTs) and a nearby property with known trichloroethylene (TCE) groundwater contamination. This nearby property, located at address 37- 26 30th Street that is the historic location of a dry cleaner (and a portion of the curren t BCP Site), would be further investigated under a limited subsurface investigation completed in June 2017 that encompassed the three properties associated with the Site. 2.3.2 June 2017 Phase II ESA A Phase II ESA was completed by Athenica Environmental S ervices, Inc. in June 2017 in response to the RECs identified as part of the Applicants' pre -acquisition due SMP Template: December 2020 Site Management Plan, Site # C241214 18 diligence. The following scope of work was completed to identify impacts to the subsurface: Performed a Ground Penetrating Rader (GPR) survey. Installed nine soil borings and collected 18 soil samples for analysis . Installed five groundwater monitoring wells to establish groundwater flow and collected five groundwater samples for analysis . Installed four sub- slab soil vapor implants and four soil vapor probes and collected four soil vapor samples, four sub- slab vapor samples with four co- located indoor air samples, and one ambient outdoor air sample for chemical analysis. Soil/fill samples collected during the Phase II were c ompared to Title 6 New York Codes, Rules and Regulations (6NYCRR) Part 375- 6.8 Unrestricted Use Soil Cleanup Objectives (SCOs) and Restricted Residential Use SCOs. The findings of the soil results were consistent with concentrations and exceedances of com pounds commonly associated with historic fill soils, with exceedances recorded mostly of semi- volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) and metals. Most of the soil borings samples were collected from the 0 to 2- feet below ground surface (ft. bgs) and 12 to 14- ft. bgs intervals. Groundwater samples collected during the Phase II were compared to 6NYCRR Part 703.5 Class GA Ambient Water Quality Standards (AWQS) . Only the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) chloroform and tetrachloroethylene (PCE) were detected above their respective AWQS at the Site. SVOCs, metals, and pesticides, were detected slightly above their respective AWQS, but were attributed to the turbidity of the groundwater prior to laboratory filtering. Soil vapor and sub- slab samples collected during the Phase II were compared to the compounds listed in the New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) Final Guidance for Evaluating Soil Vapor Intrusion in the State of New York (2006), with updates (SVI Guidance). PCE and TCE in indoor air were compared to the Air Guidance Values as presented in Table 3.1 of the NYSDOH Soil Vapor Intrusion Guidance . The results of the comparison have identified the requirement for mitigation of PCE and TCE at the Site. Other VOCs in the indoor air were compared to the upper fence value found in fuel oil heated homes according to a NYSDOH 2003 study. Thirty- two VOCs were detected at or SMP Template: December 2020 Site Management Plan, Site # C241214 19 above their respective method detection limits with 10 VOCs detected at elevated concentrations . 2.3.3 November 2018 Geotechnical Explor ation Report A geotechnical investigation of the Site was conducted in September 2018 by GTA Engineering Services of New York, P.C. (GTA). The relevant findings of the investigation include the identification of an uncontrolled fill layer underneath the S ite, consisting of sand with minor amounts of concrete debris, which is underlain by native soil and bedrock. The borings were advanced to completion depths ranging from approximately 52- to 79- ft. bgs. The surface of the Site consisted of either a 2- inch concrete floor slab or a 3- inch-thick layer of asphalt. The layer of fill material comprised of loose sand with minor amounts of debris was encountered beneath the surface material, ranging in depth below the surface layer approximately 1- to 3-ft. Na turally deposited soils that were encountered below the fill material consisted of poorly graded sand, silty sand, and sandy silt with varying percentages of gravel, and occasional cobbles and boulders. Slightly weathered gneiss bedrock was encountered at depths ranging from approximately 50- to 74- ft. bgs, becoming shallower towards the south portion of the Site. 2.3.4 January 2020 Remedial Investigation Report A Remedial Investigation (RI) was conducted by GEI in January and February 2019. A total of 12 soil borings were advanced to 30- ft. bgs and sampled at 5- ft. intervals. Exceedances of the 6NYCRR Part 375 -6.8 UUSCOs were detected only in the upper 10 - ft. and were limited to metals and one pesticide. Six clusters of monitoring wells were installed an d sampled to assess groundwater quality. Of these, five consisted of one shallow well, screened at approximately 25- to 35- ft. bgs, and one intermediate well, screened 10- feet directly above the encountered bedrock, with final screen depth ranging from 47- to 52.5- ft. bgs. Because bedrock was encountered at a deeper elevation at the MW- 3 cluster location, a monitoring well with a deep screen interval was installed and screened 10 -feet directly above the encountered bedrock SMP Template: December 2020 Site Management Plan, Site # C241214 20 (approximately 58 - to 68- ft. bgs) in addition to the shallow and intermediate screened wells at this location. Groundwater exceedances of the 6NYCRR Part 703.5 AWQS included volatile organic compounds (VOCs), semi -volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) and metals. The SVOC exceedances were limited to two monitoring wells, were minor in nature, and are not considered Contaminants of Concern (COCs). The metal detections and exceedances in groundwater are most likely naturally occurring or related to road salt application and are not COCs for this Site. VOC impacts in the groundwater were limited to the COCs: PCE and TCE, excepting one chloroform exceedance, and were detected throughout the Site. TCE was detected at all shallow monitoring wells installed, but only exceeded the AWQS in MW - 2S (concentration of 5.2 micrograms per liter [\u00b5g/L]) and in the only deep screened monitoring well MW -3D (concentration of 8.9 \u00b5g/L). PCE was detected at every temporary monitoring well with exceedances observed at eight locations including the duplicate sam ple collected at MW -5I. Emerging contaminants 1,4- dioxane and perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) compounds were sampled in the groundwater at an upgradient and downgradient monitoring well. 1,4 -Dioxane was detected in one monitoring well above the Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) of 1 part per billion (ppb) . Analytical results collected from monitoring wells MW -2S and MW -3S are below the August 2020 New York State Drinking Water MCL established for per -fluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) of 10 parts per trillion (ppt), but above 10 ppt for per-fluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) . Analytical results collected from monitoring well MW -3S are above the MCL of 10 ppt for both PFOS and PFOA . No historical on- or off- site 1,4- Chlorinated VOCs, primarily PCE and TCE, were detected in all seven of the soil vapor sample locations. Elevated levels of chlorinated VOCs were generally found throughout the Site, with the highest detection located in the north and eastern portions of the Site. Petroleum- related VOCs were detected in four of the seven soil vapor samples collected. SMP Template: December 2020 Site Management Plan, Site # C241214 21 Five inactive aboveground storage tanks (ASTs) were identified: three 275-gallon fuel oil ASTs located within the 37 -26 30th Street tenant space, one 275- gallon waste oil AST located within the 37 -28 30th Street tenant space, and one approximately 2,500- gallon capacity heating oil AST located within the partial basement below the former Millennium Auto Collision tenant. 2.3.5 November 2021 Interim Remedial Measure Construction Completion Report GEI conducted an Interim Remedial Measure (IRM) excavation between September 2020 and February 2021. The objective of the IRM was to identify any potential contaminant source in the soil media in the redevelopment depth interval. The upper 9.5- to 14.5- ft. of the Site was excavated in a grid system pattern and screened in the field for VOCs, odors, and visual evidence of impacts. No impacted soil was observed. Confirmation end- point soil samples were collected from the excavation bottom and sidewalls. All end -point sample results were below UUSCOs. 2.3.6 Conceptual Model of On -Site Contamination Soil impacts were limited to one pesticide exceedance and metals that are likely naturally occurring; neither are considered COCs for the Site. Metals concentr ations did not exceed Restricted Residential Use Cleanup Objectives (RRSCOs). Metals concentrations exceeding UUSCOs occurred in four soil borings (SB -2, SB -6, SB -11, and SB-12) and were limited to mercury (maximum 0.43 mg/kg in SB -12 (0' - 5')). Groundwater impacts metals exceeding AWQS. Minor SVOC exceedances and detections were noted in the groundwater and were not considered COCs. Meta ls exceedances were considered naturally occurring and were not considered COCs. The VOC exceedances, excepting chloroform, were limited to the Site - specific COCs, i.e., PCE and TCE. TCE was detected at all shallow monitoring wells installed, but only ex ceeded the NYSDEC AWQS in two wells: MW- 2S and MW -3D (the only deep screened well). PCE was detected at every temporary monitoring well , with exceedances observed at eight locations. Investigations completed prior to remedial action did not identify a s ource of groundwater contamination. It is highly probable that residual SMP Template: December 2020 Site Management Plan, Site # C241214 22 contaminants were present in the groundwater originating from the historic use of the eastern portion of Tax Lot 34 as dry -clean ing facilities . Soil vapor impacts included elevated le vels of chlorinated VOCs, which were found throughout the Site, with the highest detections located in the north and eastern portions of the Site. Consistent with groundwater contamination sources, soil vapor concentrations were likely related to the form er dry -cleaning facilities that historically operated within the eastern portion of Tax Lot 34. Petroleum -related VOCs were detected in four of the seven soil vapor samples collected. No on- or off -Site sources were identified. 2.4 Remedial Action Objectives The Remedial Action Objectives (RAOs) for the Site as listed in the Decision Document dated January 25, 2021 are as follows: Groundwater RAOs for Public Health Protection Prevent contact with, or inhalation of , volatiles from contaminated groundwater. Prevent ingestion of groundwater with contaminant levels exceeding drinking water standards. RAOs for Environmental Protection Restore ground water aquifer to pre -disposal/pre -release conditions, to the extent practicable. Remove the source of ground or surface water contamination. Soil RAOs for Public Health Protection Prevent ingestion/direct contact with contaminated soil. Prevent inhalation of or exposure from contaminants volatilizing from contaminants in soil. RAOs for Environmental Protection Prevent migration of contaminants that would result in groundwater or surface water contamination. Soil Vapor RAOs for Public Health Protection SMP Template: December 2020 Site Management Plan, Site # C241214 23 Mitigate impacts to public health resulting from existing, or the potential for, soil vapor intrusion into buildings at a site. 2.5 Remedial Action The site was remediated in accordance with the remedy selected by the NYSDEC in the Decision Document dated January 2021. The factors considered during the selection of the remedy are those listed in 6NYCRR 375- 1.8. The following are the components of the selected remedy , as described in the Decision Document : 1. A remedial design program will be implemented to provide the details necessary for the construction, operation, optimization, maintenance, and monitoring of the remedial program. Green remediation principles and techniques will be implemented to the extent feasible in the design, implementation, and site management of the remedy as per DER -31. The major green remediation components are as follows: Considering the environmental impacts of treatment te chnologies and remedy stewardship over the long term; Reducing direct and indirect greenhouse gases and other emissions; Increasing energy efficiency and minimizing use of non- renewable energy; Conserving and efficiently managing resources and materials; Reducing waste, increasing recycling and increasing reuse of materials which would otherwise be considered a waste; Maximizing habitat value and creating habitat when possible; Fostering green and healthy communities and working landscapes which balance eco logical, economic and social goals; Integrating the remedy with the end use where possible and encouraging green and sustainable re -development; and Additionally, to incorporate green remediation principles and techniques to the extent feasible in the future development at this site, any future on- site buildings will include, at a minimum, a 20 - mil vapor barrier/waterproofing membrane on the foundation to improve energy efficiency as an element of construction; 2. In-situ chemical oxidation (ISCO) was implemen ted to treat the groundwater contaminated with volatile organic compounds (VOCs). A chemical oxidant was injected into the subsurface to destroy the contaminants across the site. The Department will determine if additional injections are necessary. SMP Template: December 2020 Site Management Plan, Site # C241214 24 Monitoring will be conducted for contaminants of concern upgradient and downgradient of the site to determine if the contaminants of concern (COCs) are reduced to below groundwater standards or asymptotic levels. This level of groundwater treatment must be achie ved within 5 years of the date of the Certificate of Completion or the remedy would result in a Track 2 Restricted Residential cleanup . 3. Any on- site buildings will be required to have a sub- slab depressurization system, or other acceptable measures, to miti gate the migration of vapors into the building from soil and/or groundwater. The system and any vapor intrusion monitoring must no longer be needed within 5 years of the date of the Certificate of Completion, or the remedy would result in a Track 2 Restric ted Residential cleanup . 4. If no EE or SMP is needed to achieve soil, or soil vapor remedial action objectives, then the following local use restriction will be relied upon to prevent ingestion of groundwater: Article 141 of the NYCDOHMH code, which prohibit s potable use of groundwater without prior approval . Contingent Remedy Elements (Paragraphs 5 and 6) In the event that Track 1 unrestricted use is not achieved, including achievement of groundwater and soil vapor remedial objectives, the following contingent remedial elements will be required, and the remedy will achieve a Track 2 Restricted Residential cleanup. The Track 2 cleanup would require an Environmental Easement and Site Management Plan. 1. Imposition of an institutional control in the form of an environmental easement for the controlled property which will: Require the remedial party or site owner to complete and submit to the Department a periodic certification of institutional and engineering controls in accordance with Part 375- 1.8 (h)(3). Allow the use and development of the controlled property for restricted residential use as defined by Part 375- 1.8(g), although land use is subject to local zoning laws . Restrict the use of groundwater as a source of potable or process water, without necessary water quality treatment as determined by the NYSDOH or NYCDOHMH. Require compliance with the Department approved Site Management Plan. 2. A Site Management Plan is required, which includes the following: An Institutional and Engineering Control Pl an that identifies all use restrictions and engineering controls for the site and details the steps and media -specific requirements necessary to ensure the following institutional and/or engineering controls remain in place and effective: SMP Template: December 2020 Site Management Plan, Site # C241214 25 Institutional Con trols: The Environmental Easement is discussed in Paragraph 5 above. Engineering Controls : The in -situ chemical oxidation and the sub-slab depressurization system are discussed in Paragraphs 2 and 3, respectively. This plan includes, but may not be limited to: Descriptions of the provisions of the environmental easement including any land use, and groundwater . Provisions for the management and inspection of the identified engineering controls . Maintaining site access controls and Department notification . The steps necessary for the periodic reviews and certification of the institutional and/or engineering controls. A Monitoring Plan to assess the performance and effectiveness of the remedy. The plan includes, but may not be limited to: o Monitoring of groundwater and soil vapor to assess the performance and effectiveness of the remed y. o A schedule of monitoring and frequency of submittals to the Department . An Operation and Maintenance (O&M) Plan to ensure continued operation, maintenance, optimization, monitoring, inspection, and reporting of any mechanical or physical components of the remedy. The plan includes, but is not limited to: o procedures for operating and maintaining the remedy; o compliance monitoring of treatment systems to ensure proper O&M as well as providing the data for any necessary permit or permit equivalent reporting; o maintaining site access controls and Department notification; and o providing the Department access to the site and O&M records. 2.6 Remaining Contamination 2.6.1 Soil All confirmation end -point soil samples collected after completion of the remedial excavation were below Unrestricted Use SCOs. Figure 5 shows the end -point soil sample SMP Template: December 2020 Site Management Plan, Site # C241214 26 locations. Table 1 summarizes the results of all soil samples collected at the site a fter completion of remedial action. 2.6.2 Groundwater Groundwater samples were collected from the ISCO monitoring network during the first and second quarters of 2021 to assess the effectiveness of the ISCO remedy, which was implemented in December 2020 and January 2021. The first quarter (Q1) samples were collected on March 25 and 29, 2021, approximately two months after the completion of the ISCO injection program . The second quarter (Q2) samples were collected on June 29, 2021. Low flow sampling methodology was used in accordance with the CQAP, included as an appendix to the RAWP. In the Q1 2021 samples, e xceedances of the AWQS were limited to the COC tetrachloroethene (PCE) and the following metals: chromium, iron, manganese, sodium, and mercury. PCE concentrations exceeded the AWQS of 5 \u00b5g/L in all four wells. The maximum concentration (140 \u00b5g/L) occurred in MW -P1, located on the southeast (upgradient) side of the Site, a reduction from the pre -ISCO level of 220 \u00b5g/L. The concentration in MW - P3, loc ated on the southwest (downgradient) side of the Site, decreased to 45 \u00b5g/L from 110 \u00b5g/L pre -ISCO. The concentrations MW -P4 (25 \u00b5g/L), located upgradient of the northeast Site boundary and downgradient of the northwest Site boundar y, respectively , did not change significantly from their pre -ISCO levels. The presence of PCE in the two upgradient wells both before and after ISCO implementation indicate the possibility of an off -Site source of PCE contamination. The metals exceedances are comparable to results from the previous quarter, with the exception of mercury, which was detected at 1.6 \u00b5g/L in MW -P3 (1.8 \u00b5g/L in the duplicate). The AWQS for mercury is 0.7 \u00b5g/L. Mercury was not detected in any groundwater monitoring wells in the previous quarter. In the Q2 2021 samples, e xceedances of the AWQS were limited to PCE and the following metals: chromium, copper, iron, lead, manganese, nickel, sodium, and mercury. SMP Template: December 2020 Site Management Plan, Site # C241214 27 PCE concentrations exceeded the AWQS of 5 \u00b5g/L in all four wells but were lower than results from the previous quarter. The highest PCE concentration (66 \u00b5g/L [72 \u00b5g/L in the duplicate]) occurred in MW-P1, located on the southeast (upgradient) side of the Site. Quarterly sampling results to date show a decreasing trend from the pre -ISCO level of 220 \u00b5g/L in this well. The PCE concentration in MW -P3, located on the southwest (downgradient) side of the Site, was 27 \u00b5g/L. Quarterly sampling results to date show a decreasing trend from the pre -ISCO level of 110 \u00b5g/L. PCE concentrations in MW -P2 and MW -P4, both located on the north side of the Site, showed little change between Q4 2020 (pre -ISCO) and Q1 2021 (post -ISCO), but the concentrations in both wells were lower in Q2 2021 than in the previous quarter. The in MW 26 \u00b5g/L and 11 \u00b5g/L, respectively. Metals concentrations were generally higher than in the previous two quarters, with exceedances of chromium, copper, lead, and nickel occurring for the first time since monitoring began. I ron and manganese exceedances recurred at concentrations higher than in the previous two quarters. Sodium exceedances recurred at concentrations lower than in the previous two quarters. Mercury, which historically has only been detected in MW - P3, decreas ed from 1.6 \u00b5g/L (1.8 in Q1 2021 to 0.82 \u00b5g/L. The AWQS for mercury is 0.7 \u00b5g/L. Table 2 presents pre- ISCO baseline results from samples collected in December 2020. Table 3 presents the results of the first post -ISCO sampling event performed in March 2021. Table 4 presents the results of the second post-ISCO sampling event performed in June 2021. Figure 6 shows a box map of groundwater exceedances before and after ISCO injections were completed. 2.6.3 Soil Vapor An active sub- slab depressurization system (SSDS) is being constructed in each of the two on- Site buildings as part of redevelopment to mitigate the elevated levels of PCE and TCE in soil vapor detected in samples collected during the RI . SMP Template: December 2020 Site Management Plan, Site # C241214 28 3.0 Institutional and Engineering Control Plan 3.1 General Since remaining contamination exists at the site, Institutional Controls (ICs) and Engineer ing Controls (ECs) are required to protect human health and the environment. This IC/EC Plan describes the procedures for the implementation and management of all IC/ECs at the site. The IC/EC Plan is one component of the SMP and is subject to revision by the NYSDEC project manager . This plan provides: A description of all IC/ECs on the site . The basic implementation and intended role of each IC/EC . A description of the key components of the ICs set forth in the Environmental Easement . A description of the controls to be evaluated during each required inspection and periodic review . A description of plans and procedures to be followed for implementation of IC/ECs, such as the implementation of the Excavation Work Plan (EWP) (as provided in Appendix E) for the proper handling of remaining contamination that may be disturbed during maintenance or redevelopment work on the site . Any other provisions necessary to identify or establish methods for implementing the IC/ECs required by the site remedy, as determined by the NYSDEC project manager . 3.2 Institutional Controls A series of ICs is required by the Decision Document to: (1) implement, maintain and monitor Engineering Control systems; (2) prevent future exposure to remaining contamination; and, (3) limit the use and development of the site to restricted residential uses only. Adherence to these ICs on the site is required by the Environmental Easement and will be implemented under this SMP. ICs identified in the Environmental Ea sement may not be discontinued without an amendment to or extinguishment of the Environmental Easement . The IC boundaries are shown on Figure 2. These ICs are: Require the remedial party or site owner to complete and submit to the Department a periodic certification of institutional and engineering controls in accordance with Part 375 -1.8 (h)(3) . SMP Template: December 2020 Site Management Plan, Site # C241214 29 Allow the use and development of the controlled property for restricted residential use as defined by Part 375- 1.8(g), although land use is subject to local zoning laws . Restrict the use of groundwater as a source of potable or process water, without necessary water quality treatment as determined by the NYSDOH or NYCDOHMH. Require compliance with the Department approved Site Management Plan. 3.3 Engine ering Controls 3.3.1 Monitoring Wells Associated with In -Situ Chemical Oxidation A network of four monitoring wells was constructed to monitor the effectiveness of the ISCO remedy. The objective of this EC is to monitor groundwater quality until sample an alytical results are below AWQS or asymptotic levels are reached. The monitoring wells are located immediately outside the Site boundaries on the upgradient and downgradient sides. The upgradient wells are designated MW -P1 and MW - P2 and are located within the sidewalk along 30th Street. The downgradient wells are designated MW -P3 and MW -P4 and are located in a soil covered area within the alley known as Old Ridge Road. Figure 7 shows the location of the EC monitoring well network for the site. The monitoring well network was installed on November 17, 2020. Monitoring well construction logs are included in Appendix D. All wells are screened at the water table, from 25 - to 35- ft. bgs. The screened interval is the same as for the shal low temporary wells installed during the RI, in which most COC exceedances were detected. It is also the interval where ISCO injections were applied. The wells are constructed of two- inch diameter schedule 40 PVC with 0.020- inch slotted screen. Each wel l is capped with a J -plug and covered with a five -inch diameter flush mounted steel manhole cover. Quarterly groundwater monitoring of the well network commenced in December 2020 with collection of baseline samples prior to ISCO implementation. The ISCO W ork Plan was implemented from December 2020 through January 2021. The first post -ISCO samples were collected in March 2021. Samples will be collected quarterly from the monitoring well network as described in the Monitoring and Sampling Plan in Section 4.0 of this SMP. SMP Template: December 2020 Site Management Plan, Site # C241214 30 Procedures for operating and maintaining the monitoring wells associated with ISCO are documented in the Operation and Maintenance Plan (Section 5.0 of this SMP) . 3.3.2 Sub- depressurization system (SSDS) was constructed in each of the two on- Site buildings during redevelopment. The purpose of the SSDS is to mitigate potential soil vapor intrusion (SVI) by inducing a vacuum, i.e., negative pressure, below the building slabs. The SSDS consists of the following components installed within each of the two newly constructed on- Site buildings: a network of perforated sub- slab piping, a vapor barrier, a riser pipe terminating at the roof, inline vapor mitigation fans, and a network of permanent vapor monitoring points. The SSDS, as designed , provide s active depressurization, which can be made passive by the removing or shutting down of in -line vapor mitigation fans. The permanent vapor monitoring points will be used to monitor SSDS performance by taking vacuum measurements with a digital manometer. The monitoring points may also be used to sample sub- slab soil vapor . The sub- slab piping networks were designed to induce vacuum below all tenant storage spaces and mechanical rooms located in the cellars of both buildings. Figure 8 shows the area serviced by the SSDS , as-built sub -slab piping layouts and locations of vapor monitoring points. The network of on -site soil vapor intrusion sample locations has been designed based on the following criteria: Four permanent vapor monitoring points were installed in each building, throughout the area of the building serviced by the SSDS; All vapor monitoring points extend approximately 24- inches below the top of the cell ar slab. 3.3.3 Criteria for Completion of Remediation/Termination of Remedial Systems Generally, remedial processes are considered completed when monitoring indicates that the remedy has achieved the remedial action objectives identified by the decision document . The framework for determining when remedial processes are complete is provided in Section 6.4 of NYSDEC DER -10. Unless waived by the NYSDEC, SMP Template: December 2020 Site Management Plan, Site # C241214 31 confirmation samples of applicable environmental media are required before terminating any remedial actions at the site. Confirmation samples require Category B deliverables and a Data Usability Summary Report ( DUSR ). As discussed below, the NYSDEC may approve termination of a groundwater monitoring program. W hen a remedial party receives this approval, the remedial party will decommission all site -related monitoring, injection and recovery wells as per the NYSDEC CP-43 policy. The remedial party will also conduct any needed site restoration activities, such a s asphalt patching and decommissioning treatment system equipment. In addition, t he remedial party will conduct any necessary restoration of vegetation coverage, trees and wetlands, and will comply with NYSDEC and United States Army Corps of Engineers regulations and guidance. Also, the remedial party will ensure that no ongoing erosion is occurring on the site. 3.3.3.1 Monitoring Wells associated with In- Situ Chemical Oxidation Groundwater monitoring activities to assess ISCO will continue, as determined by the NYSDEC project manager in consultation with NYSDOH project manager , until residual groundwater concentrations are found to be consistently below ambient water quality standards or the site SCGs or have become asymptotic at an acceptable level over an extended period. I f monitoring data indicates that monitoring may no longer be required, a proposal to discontinue the remedy will be submitted by the remedial party. Monitoring will continue until permission to discontinue is granted in writing by the NYSDEC project manager . If groundwater contaminant levels become asymptotic at a level that is not acceptable to the NYSDEC, additional injections, source removal, treatment and/or control measures will be evaluated. 3.3.3.2 Sub- Slab Depressurization System (SSDS) Operation of t he active SSDS will not be discontinued unless prior written approval is granted by the NYSDEC and the NYSDOH project managers. If monitoring data indicates that the SSDS may no longer be required, a proposal to discontinue the SSDS will be submitted by the remedial party to the NYSDEC and NYSDOH project managers. SMP Template: December 2020 Site Management Plan, Site # C241214 32 4.0 Monitoring and S ampling P lan 4.1 General This Monitoring and Sampling Plan describes the measures for evaluating the overall performance and effectiveness of the remedy.

These periodic inspections must be conducted when the ground surface is visible (i.e. no snow cover). Site -wide inspections will be performed by a qualified environmental professional as defined in 6 NYCRR Part 375, a PE who is licensed and registered in N ew York State, or a qualified person who directly reports to a PE who is licensed and registered in New York State. Modification to the frequency or duration of the inspections will require approval from the NYSDEC project manager . Site-wide inspections wi ll also be performed after all severe weather conditions that may affect ECs or monitoring devices. During these inspections, an inspection form will be completed as provided in Appendix H - Site Management Forms . The form will compile sufficient information to assess the following: Compliance with all ICs, including site usage . An evaluation of the condition and continued effectiveness of ECs . General site conditions at the time of the inspection . Whether stormwater management systems, such as basins and o utfalls, are working as designed. The site management activities being conducted including, where appropriate, confirmation sampling and a health and safety inspection. Confirm that site records are up to date. Inspections of all remedial components instal led at the site will be conducted . A comprehensive site -wide inspection will be conducted and documented according to the SMP schedule, regardless of the frequency of the Periodic Review Report . The inspections will determine and document the following: Whether ECs continue to perform as designed. If these controls continue to be protective of human health and the environment . Compliance with requirements of this SMP and the Environmental Easement . Achievement of remedial performance criteria; and If site records are complete and up to date . Reporting requirements are outlined in Section 7.0 of this plan. SMP Template: December 2020 Site Management Plan, Site # C241214 34 Inspections will also be performed in the event of an emergency. If an emergency, such as a natural disaster or an unforeseen failure of any o f the ECs occurs that reduces or has the potential to reduce the effectiveness of ECs in place at the site, verbal notice to the NYSDEC project manager must be given by noon of the following day. In addition, an inspection of the site will be conducted wit hin 5 days of the event to verify the effectiveness of the IC/ECs implemented at the site by a qualified environmental professional , as defined in 6 NYCCR Part 375. Written confirmation must be provided to the NYSDEC project manager within 7 days of the event that includes a summary of actions taken, or to be taken, and the potential impact to the environment and the public. 4.3 Treatment System Monitoring and Sampling 4.3.1 Remedial System Monitoring Monitoring of the SSDS will be performed on a routine basis, as identified in Table 5 - Remedial System Monitoring Requirements and Schedule (see below) . The monitoring of remedial systems must be conducted by a qualified environmental professional as defined in 6 NYCRR Part 375, a PE who is licensed and registered in New York State, or a qualified person who directly reports to a PE who is licensed and registered in New York State. Modification to the frequency or sampling requirements will require approval from the NYSDEC project manager . A visual inspection of the complete system will be conducted during each monitoring event . Unscheduled inspections and/or sampling may take place when a suspected failure of the SSDS system has been reported or an emergency occurs that is deem ed likely to affect the operation of the system. SSDS components to be monitored include, but are not limited to, the components listed below .

A complete list of components to be inspected is provided in the Inspection Checklist, provided in A ppendix H - Site Management Forms . If any equipment readings are not within their specified operation range, any equipment is observed to be malfunctioning or the system is not performing within specifications; maintenance and repair, as per the Operation and Maintenance Plan, is required immediately. 4.4 Post-Remediation Media Monitoring and Sampling 4.4.1 Groundwater Sampling Groundwater monitoring will be performed quarterly to assess the performance of the remedy. Modification to the frequency or sampling requirements will require approval from the NYSDEC project manager . The network of monitoring wells has been installed to monitor upgradient and downgradient groundwater conditions at the site . The network of on- site wells has been designed based on t he following criteria: Two monitoring wells are located immediately upgradient of the Site; Two monitoring wells are located immediately downgradient of the Site; All monitoring wells are screened at the water table. All wells are screened at the water table, from 25 - to 35- ft. bgs. The screened interval is the same as for the shallow temporary wells installed during the RI, in which SMP Template: December 2020 Site Management Plan, Site # C241214 36 most COC exceedances were detected. It is also the interval where ISCO injections were applied. The wells are constructed of two- inch diameter schedule 40 PVC with 0.020- inch slotted screen. Each well is capped with a J -plug and covered with a five -inch diameter flush mounted steel manhole cover. Table 6 below summarizes the well identification number, as well as the purpose, location, depths, diameter and screened intervals of the wells . As part of the groundwater monitoring, two upgradient wells and two downgradient wells are sampled to evaluate the effectiveness of the remedial system . The remedial party will measure depth to the water table for each monitoring well in the network before sampling. Table 6 Monitoring Well Construction Details Monitoring Well ID Well Location Coordinates (longitude/ latitude) Well Diameter (inches) Elevation ( NAVD 88 ) Casing Screen are included in Appendix D of this SMP . Samples shall be collected from the groundwater on a routine basis. Sampling locations required analytical parameters and schedule are provided in the Remedial System Sampling Requirements and Schedule below. Modification to the frequency or sampling requi rements will require approval from the NYSDEC project manager. SMP Template: December 2020 Site Management Plan, Site # C241214 37 Post Remediation Sampling Requirements and Schedule Sampling Location Analytical Parameters Schedule VOCs (EPA Method 8260D) MW-P1 X Quarterly MW-P2 X Quarterly MW-P3 X Quarterly MW-P4 X Quarterly Detailed sample collection and analytical procedures and protocols are provided in Appendix F - Quality Assurance Project Plan. If biofouling or silt accumulation occurs in the on- site and/or off -site monitoring wells, the wells will be physically agitated/surged and redeveloped. Additionally, monitoring wells will be properly decommissioned and replaced, if an event renders the wells unusable . Repairs and/or replacement of wells in the monitoring well network will be performed based on assessments of structural integrity and overall performance . The NYSDEC project manager will be notified prior to any repair or decommissioning of any monitoring well for the purpose of replacement, and the repair or decommissioning and replacement process will be documented in the subsequent Periodic Review Report . Well decommissioning without replacement will be done only with the prior approval of the NYSDEC project manager . Well abandonment will be performed in accordance with NYSDEC 's guidance entitled \"CP -43: Groundwater Monitoring Well Decommissioning Procedures.\" Monitoring wells that are decommissioned because they have been rendered unusable will be replaced in kind in the nearest available location, unless otherwise approved by the NYSDEC project manager . The sampling frequency may only be modified with the approval of the NYSDEC project manager . This SMP will be modified to reflect changes in sampling plans approved by the NYSDEC project manager . Deliverables for the groundwater monitoring program are specified in Section 7.0 - Reporting Requirements. SMP Template: December 2020 Site Management Plan, Site # C241214 38 4.4.2 Post-Mitigation Indoor Air Sampling Post-mitigation indoor air sampling will be performed no sooner than 30 days following the startup of the SSDS, within the hea ting season, to confirm the effectiveness of the system. If the system is installed outside of the heating season, post -mitigation air sampling will be required prior to occupancy and based on the results may need to be repeated the following heating seas on. Three indoor air samples will be collected from the basement of each building in the area serviced by the active SSDS. These indoor air samples will be collected via 6 -liter SUMMA canisters set to fill over a 24 -hour time period and analyzed for chlo rinated VOCs via EPA Method TO -15. Figure 9 depicts the locations of the proposed post -mitigation air samples. A chemical inventory will be conducted at the time of sampling to determine if any stored chemicals have the potential to impact sampling results. The locations of these samples will be determined based upon field conditions. An ambient air sample will be also collected in a similar manner for comparison purposes. The sampling frequency may only be modified with the approval of the NYSDEC project manager . This SMP will be modified to reflect changes in sampling plans approved by the NYSDEC project manager . Deliverables for the post mitigation indoor air sampling program are specified in Section 7.0 - Reporting Requirements. 4.4.3 Post-Mitigation SVI Evaluation The sub- grade parking areas on the west side of both buildings were excluded from the areas serviced by the SSDS, because these areas will be constructed with high - volume air exchange systems, which are to be operated continuously. An SVI evaluation will be conducted in these areas to determine whether mitigation is required. The SVI evaluation will consist of collecting one indoor air sample and one collocated sub- slab soil vapor sample from the cellar parking area of each building. Penetrations of the vapor barrier for the purpose of collecting sub- slab samples will be repaired in accordance with the vapor barrier material manufacturer. An outdoor ambient air sample will also be collected. If the results indicate that m itigation is required, then the high- volume air exchange systems will be evaluated for their effectiveness and alternate means of mitigation and/or monitoring will be discussed with NYSDEC and NYSDOH. SMP Template: December 2020 Site Management Plan, Site # C241214 39 4.4.4 Monitoring and Sampling Protocol All sampling a ctivities will be recorded in a field book and associated sampling log as provided in Appendix H - Site Management Forms . Other observations (e.g., groundwater monitoring well integrity) will be noted on the sampling log. The sampling log will serve as the inspection form for the monitoring network. Additional detail regarding monitoring and sampling protocols are provided in the site -specific Quality Assurance Project Plan provided as Appendix F of this document. SMP Template: December 2020 Site Management Plan, Site # C241214 40 5.0 Operation and Maintenance Plan 5.1 General This Operation and Maintenance Plan provides a brief description of the measures necessary to operate, monitor and maintain the mechanical components of the remedy selected for the site . This Operation and Maintenance Plan : Includes the procedures necessary to allow individuals unfamiliar with the site to operate and maintain the sub- slab-depressurization system (SSDS) ; Will be updated periodically to reflect changes in site conditions or the manner in which the SSDS is operated and maintained. 5.2 Sub- Slab Depressurization System Performance Criteria A pilot test of the SSDS piping and vapor monitoring points will be conducted to complete the design of the SSDS and determine system performance criteria . The pilot test will be scheduled in coordination with the construction schedule so that the SSDS will be installed and operational prior to building occupancy. The purpose of the pilot test is to determine the necessary fan power and speed required to induce the required vacuum at all eight vapor monitoring points, i.e. VMP -1 through VMP -8, and to determine whether any treatment of the vapor -phase effluent may be required prior to discharge. The pilot test will be performed by a subcontractor of GEI. The pilot test procedure will consist of connecting a portable blower to the SSDS piping where it penetrates the slab, taking vacuum measurements at all monitoring points at a range of blower speeds, and collecting an effluent vapor sample from each of the two buildings for analysis by EPA Method TO -15 at a NYSDEC Environmental Laboratory Accreditation Program certified laboratory. All vacuum measurements will be made using a Dwyer Series 477AV handheld digital manometer or equivalent. The vapor stream velocity will be measured at each pilot test blower speed using a TSI VelociCalc ventilation meter or equivalent inserted through a perforation in the hose/pipe connecting the blower to the sub -slab piping. Prior to pilot testing, all vapor monitoring points will be seal checked using a helium leak test procedure to ensure the validity of vacuum measurements. The in -line ventilatio n fans will be operated at speeds sufficient to induce a continuous minimum vacuum of - 0.02 inches H 2O at all vapor monitoring points. SMP Template: December 2020 Site Management Plan, Site # C241214 41 Following completion of the pilot test, this section will be revised to specify the in - line fan selection, the design flow rate, and any applicable vapor -phase effluent discharge requirements. 5.3 Operation and Maintenance of Sub- slab Depressurization System Following SSDS pilot testing , the following sections will be revised to provide a description of the operations and mainte nance of the SSDS. Cut-sheets and as -built drawings for the SSDS will be provided in an appendix entitled Operations and Maintenance Manual . 5.3.1 System Start- Up and Testing This section will include a description of, as appropriate: Manufacturer's recommendations Pre start -up inspection Baseline measurements Testing methods: o Checks for leaks o Checks of seals o Check of backdrafts o Pressure tests o System balancing o Warning devices o Sampling. The system testing described above will be conducted if, in the course of the SSDS system lifetime, the system goes down or significant changes are made to the system and the system must be restarted . 5.3.2 Routine System Operation and Maintenance This section will include a description of: Manufacturer's recommendations Troubleshooting guide Adjustment and repairs Operation schedule Inspections SMP Template: December 2020 Site Management Plan, Site # C241214 42 Routine maintenance activities and minimum schedules. A summary and schedule of routine maintenance will be provided in table form. 5.3.3 Non-Routine Operation and Maintenance This section will include a description of: Warning devices initiated Damage Reduced effectiveness System or component replacement. 5.3.4 System Monitoring Devices and Alarms The SSDS will have a warning device to indicate that the system is not operating properly. In the event that warning device is activated, applicable maintenance and repairs will be conducted, as specified in the Operation and Maintenance Plan, and the SSDS will be restarted . Operational problems will be noted in the Periodic Review Report to be prepared for that reporting period. SMP Template: December 2020 Site Management Plan, Site # C241214 43 6.0 Periodic Assessments/Evaluations 6.1 Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment Increases in both the severity and frequency of storms/weather events, an increase in sea level elevations along with accompanying flooding impacts, shifting precipitation patterns and wide temperature fluctuation, resulting from global climactic change and instability, have the potential to significantly impact the performance, effectiveness and protectiveness of a given site and associated remedial systems. Vulnerability assessments provide information so that the site and associated remedial systems are prepared for the impacts of the increasing f requency and intensity of severe storms/weather events and associated flooding. This section briefly summarizes the vulnerability of the site and/or engineering controls to severe storms/weather events and associated flooding. The Site is not located within any State or Federal flood plains. Erosion is not a concern, as the entire Site footprint is covered by buildings. No part of the Site is susceptible to damage due to high wind conditions. Flooding is unlikely, as the on- Site buildings are equipped wi th stormwater detention basins. Because the SSDS is activated by an electric in -line ventilation fan, SSDS operation will be susceptible to disruption due to electrical power outage. There is no potential for a spill or contaminant release due to climate related events . 6.2 Remedial System Opt imization A Remedial Site Optimization (RSO) study will be conducted any time that the NYSDEC project manager or the remedial party requests in writing that an in -depth evaluation of the remedy is needed. An RSO may be appropriate if any of the following occur: The remedial actions have not met or are not expected to meet RAOs in the time frame estimated in the Decision Document . The management and operation of the remedial system is exceeding the estimated costs . The remedial system is not performing as expected or as designed. Previously unidentified source material may be suspected. SMP Template: December 2020 Site Management Plan, Site # C241214 44 Plume shift has potentially occurred . Site conditions change due to development, change of use, change in groundwater use, etc. There is an anticipated transfer of the site management to another remedial party or agency . A new and applicable remedial technology becomes available. An RSO will provide a critique of a site's conceptual model, give a summary of past performance, document current cleanup practices, summarize progress made toward the site's cleanup goals, gather additional performance or media specific data and information and provide recommendations for improvements to enhance the ability of the present system to reach RAOs or to provide a basis for changing the remedial strategy. SMP Template: December 2020 Site Management Plan, Site # C241214 45 7.0.

SMP Template: December 2020 Site Management Plan, Site # C241214 This notification will include: A detailed description of the work to be performed, including the location and areal extent of excavation , plans /drawings for site re -grading, intrusive elements or utilities to be installed below the soil cover, estimated volumes of contaminated soil to be excavated , any modifications of truck r outes, and any work that may impact an engineering control; A summary of environmental conditions anticipated to be encountered in the work areas, including the nature and concentration levels of contaminants of concern, potential presence of grossly contaminated media, and plans for any pre-construction sampling; A schedule for the work, detailing the start and completion of all intrusive work; A summary of the applicable components of this EWP; A statement that the work will be performed in compliance with this EWP and 29 CFR 1910.120; A copy of the contractor's health and safety plan (HASP) , in electronic format, if it differs from the HASP provided in Appendix G of th e SMP; Identification of disposal facilities for potential waste streams; and Identification of sources of any anticipated backfill, along with the required request to import form and all supporting documentation including, but not limited to, chemical testing results. 2 SOIL SCREENING METHODS Visual, olfactory and instrument -based (e.g. photoionization detector) soil screening will be performed during all excavations into known or potentially contaminated material (remaining contamination) or a breach of the cover system. A qualified environmental professional as defined in 6 NYCRR Part 375, a PE who is licensed and registered in New York State, or a qualified person who directly reports to a PE who is licensed and registered in New York State will perform the screening . Soil screening will be performed when invasive work is done and will include all excavation and invasive work performed during development, such as excavations for foundations and utility work, after issuance of the COC. SMP Template: December 2020 Site Management Plan, Site # C241214 Soils will be segregated based on previous environmental data and screening results into material that requires off -site disposal and material that requires testing to determine if the material can be reused on- site as soil beneath a cover or if the material can be used as cover soil . Further discussion of off -site disposal of materials and on -site reuse is provided in Sections 6 and 7 of this EWP . 3 SOIL STAGING METHODS Soil stockpiles will be continuously encircled with a berm and/or silt fence. Hay bales will be used as needed near catch basins, surface wat ers and other discharge points. Stockpiles will be kept covered at all times with appropriately anchored tarps. Stockpiles will be routinely inspected and damaged tarp covers will be promptly replaced. Stockpiles will be inspected at a minimum once each week and after every storm event . Results of inspections will be recorded in a logbook and maintained at the site and available for inspection by the NYSDEC. 4 MATERIALS EXCAVATION AND LOAD- OUT A qualified environmental professional as defined in 6 NYCRR Part 375, a PE who is licensed and registered in New York State, or a qualified person who directly reports to a PE who is licensed and registered in New York State will oversee all invasive work and the excavation and load -out of all excavated material. The owner of the property and remedial party (if applicable) and its contractors are responsible for safe execution of all invasive and other work performed under this Plan. The presence of utilities and easements on the site will be investigated by the qualified environmental professional. It will be determined whether a risk or impediment SMP Template: December 2020 Site Management Plan, Site # C241214 to the planned work under this SMP is posed by utilities or easements on the site. A site utility stakeout will be completed for all utilities prior to any ground intrusive activities at the site. Loaded vehicles leaving the site will be appropriately lined, tarped, securely covered, manifested, and placarded in accordance with appropriate Federal, State, local, and NYSDOT requirements (and all other applicable transportation requirements). A truck wash will be operated on-site, as appropriate. The qualified environmental professional will be responsible for ensuring that all outbound trucks will be washed at the truck wash before leaving the site until the activities performed under this section are complete . Truck wash waters will be collected and disposed of off -site in an appropriate manner. Locations where vehicles enter or exit the site shall be inspected daily for evidence of off- site soil tracking. The qualified environmental professional will be responsible for ensuring that all egress points for truck and equipment transport from the site are clean of dirt and other materials deri ved from the site during intrusive excavation activities. Cleaning of the adjacent streets will be performed as needed to maintain a clean condition with respect to site-derived materials. Material accumulated from the street cleaning and egress cleaning activities will be disposed off -site at a permitted landfill facility in accordance with all applicable local, State, and Federal regulations. 5 MATERIALS TRANSPORT OFF -SITE All transport of materials will be performed by licensed haulers in accordance w ith appropriate local, State, and Federal regulations, including 6 NYCRR Part 364. Haulers will be appropriately licensed and trucks properly placarded. SMP Template: December 2020 Site Management Plan, Site # C241214 Material transported by trucks exiting the site will be secured with tight- fitting covers. Loose -fitting canvas -type truck covers will be prohibited. If loads contain wet material capable of producing free liquid, truck liners will be used. All trucks loaded with site materials will exit the vicinity of the site using only these approved truck routes . This is the most appropriate route and takes into account: (a) limiting transport through residential areas and past sensitive sites; (b) use of city mapped truck routes; (c) prohibiting off -site queuing of trucks entering the facility; (d) limiting total distance to major highways; (e) promoting safety in access to highways; and (f) overall safety in transport. Trucks will be prohibited from stopping and idling in the neighborhood outside the project site. Egress points for truck and equipment transport from the site will be kept clean of dirt and other materials during site remediation and development. Queuing of trucks will be performed on- site in order to minimize off -site disturbance. Off-site queuing will be prohibited. 6 MATERIALS DISPOSAL OFF- SITE All material excavated and removed from the site will be treated as contaminated and regulated material and will be transported and disposed off-site in a permitted facility in accordance with all local, State and Federal regulations. If disposal of material from this site is proposed for unregulated off -site disposal (i.e. clean soil removed for development purposes), a formal request with an associated plan will be made to the NYSDEC project manager . Unregulated off -site management of materials from this site will not occur without formal NYSDEC project manager approval. SMP Template: December 2020 Site Management Plan, Site # C241214 Off-site disposal locations for excavated soils will be identified in the pre - excavation notification . This will include estimated quantities and a breakdown by class of disposa l facility if appropriate, (e.g. hazardous waste disposal facility, solid waste landfill, petroleum treatment facility, C &D debris recovery facility ) Actual disposal quantities and associated documentation will be reported to the NYSDEC in the Periodic Review Report . This documentation will include , but will not be limited to: waste profiles, test results, facility acceptance letters, manifests, bills of lading and facility receipts. Non-hazardous historic fill and contaminated soils taken off -site will be handled consistent with 6 NYCRR Parts 360, 361, 362, 363, 364 and 365. Material that does not meet Unrestricted SCOs is prohibited from being taken to a New York State C&D debris recovery facility (6 NYCRR Subpart 360-15 registered or permitted facility ). 7 MATERIALS REUSE ON- SITE The qualified environmental professional as defined in 6 NYCRR part 375 will ensure that procedures defined for materials reuse in this SMP are followed and that unacceptable material (i.e. contaminated) does not remain on- site. Contaminated on- site material, including historic fill and contaminated soil, that is acceptable fo r reuse on -site will be placed below the demarcation layer or impervious surface, and will not be reused within a cover soil layer, within landscaping berms, or as backfill for subsurface utility lines. Proposed materials for reuse on- site must be sampled for full suite analytical parameters including per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances ( PFAS ) and 1,4 -dioxane. The sampling frequency will be in accordance with DER -10 Table 5.4(e)10 unless prior approval is obtained from the NYSDEC project manager for modification of the sampling frequency. The analytical results of soil/fill material testing must meet the site use criteria presented in NYSDEC DER -10 Appendix 5 - Allowable Constituent Levels for Imported Fill or Soil for all constituents listed , and the NYSDEC Sampling, Analysis, and Assessment of Per - and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (January 2021) guidance values. SMP Template: December 2020 Site Management Plan, Site # C241214 Approvals for modifications to the analytical parameters must be obtained from the NYSDEC project manager prior to the sampling event. Soil/fill mate rial for reuse on -site will be segregated and staged as described in Sections 2 and 3 of this EWP. The anticipated size and location of stockpiles will be provided in the 15- day notification to the NYSDEC project manager. Stockpile locations will be based on the location of site excavation activities and proximity to nearby site features. Material reuse on -site will comply with requirements of NYSDEC DER -10 Section 5.4(e)4. Any modifications to the requirements of DER -10 Section 5.4(e)4 must be approved by the NYSDEC project manager. Any demolition material proposed for reuse on- site will be sampled for asbestos and the results will be reported to the NYSDEC for acceptance. Concrete crushing or processing on- site will not be performed without prior NYSDEC approval. Organic matter (wood, roots, stumps, etc.) or other solid waste derived from clearing and grubbing of the site will not be reused on- site. 8 FLUIDS MANAGEMENT All liquids to be removed from the site, including but not limited to, excavation dewatering, decontamination waters and groundwater monitoring well purge and development waters, will be handled, transported and disposed off-site at a permitted facility in accordance with applicable local, State, and Federal regulations . Dewatering, purge and development fluids will not be recharged back to the land surface or subsurface of the site, and will be managed off -site, unless prior approval is obtained from NYSDEC. Discharge of water generated during large -scale construction activities to surface waters (i.e. a local pond, stream or river) will be performed under a SPDES permit. SMP Template: December 2020 Site Management Plan, Site # C241214 9 BACKFILL FROM OFF -SITE SOURCES All materials proposed for import onto the site will be approved by the qualified environmental professional , as defined in 6 NYCRR Part 375, and will be in compliance with provisions in this SMP prior to receipt at the site. A Request to Import/Reuse Fill or Soil form , which can be found at http://www.dec.ny.gov/regulations/67386.html , will be prepared and submitted to the NYSDEC project manager allowing a minimum of 5 business days for review. Material from industrial sites, spill sites , other environmental remediation sites , or potentially contaminated sites will not be imported to the site. All imported soils will meet the backfill and cover soil quality standards established in 6 NYCRR 375 -6.7(d) and DER -10 Appendix 5 for unrestricte d use . Based on an evaluation of the land use, protection of groundwater and protection of ecological resources criteria, the resulting soil quality standards are listed in 6 NYCRR Part 375 Table 375- 6.8(a). Non -compliant soils will not be imported onto the Site without prior approval by NYSDEC. Soils that meet ' general ' fill requirements under 6 NYCRR Part 360.13, but do not meet backfill or cover soil objectives for this site, will not be imported onto the site without prior approval by NYSDEC project manager . Soil material will be sampled for the full suite of analytical parameters, including PFAS and 1, 4-dioxane. Solid waste will not be imported onto the site. Trucks entering the site with imported soils will be securely covered with tight fitting covers . Imported soils will be stockpiled separately from excavated materials and covered to prevent dust releases. 10 STORMWATER POLLUTION PREVENTION Barriers and hay bale checks will be installed and inspected once a week and after every storm event . Results o f inspections will be recorded in a logbook and maintained at SMP Template: December 2020 Site Management Plan, Site # C241214 the site and available for inspection by the NYSDEC. All necessary repairs shall be made immediately. Accumulated sediments will be removed as required to keep the barrier and hay bale check f unctional. All undercutting or erosion of the silt fence toe anchor shall be repaired immediately with appropriate backfill materials. Manufacturer's recommendations will be followed for replacing silt fencing damaged due to weathering. Erosion and sediment control measures identified in the SMP shall be observed to ensure that they are operating correctly . Where discharge locations or points are accessible, they shall be inspected to ascertain whether erosion control measures are effective in preventing significant impacts to receiving waters. Silt fencing or hay bales will be installed around the entire perimeter of the construction a rea. 11 EXCAVATION CONTINGENCY PLAN If underground tanks or other previously unidentified contaminant sources are found during post -remedial subsurface excavations or development related construction, excavation activities will be suspended until sufficie nt equipment is mobilized to address the condition. The NYSDEC project manager will be promptly notified of the discovery. Sampling will be performed on product, sediment and surrounding soils, etc. as necessary to determine the nature of the material and proper disposal method. Chemical analysis will be performed for a full list of analytes [TAL metals , TCL volatiles and semi- , TCL pesticides and PCBs, and PFAS], unless the site history and previous sampling results provide sufficient justification to limit the list of SMP Template: December 2020 Site Management Plan, Site # C241214 analytes . In this case, a reduced list of analytes will be proposed to the N YSDEC project manager for approval prior to sampling. Any tanks will be closed as per NYSDEC regulations and guidance. Identification of unknown or unexpected contaminated media identified by screening during invasive site work will be promptly communicated by phone within two hours to NYSDEC's Project Manager. Reportable quantities of petroleum product will also be reported to the NYSDEC spills hotline . These findings will be also included in the Periodic Review Report. 12 COMMUNITY AIR MONITORING PLAN The air monitoring program will be implemented during all intrusive remedial actions to measure the concentration of particulates in ambient air in the work zone. The Community Air Monitoring Plan (CAMP) was developed in accordance with the NYSDOH Gene ric Community Air Monitoring Plan contained in Appendix 1A of the NYSDEC DER -10 and is provided as Appendix I of the SMP. The CAMP requires a dedicated air monitoring technician to implement real time air monitoring at the Site's downwind perimeter. The monitoring program includes VOCs, particulates, and meteorological data be recorded. Action levels for VOCs and particulates are specified in the CAMP. Meteorological data consisting of wind speed, wind direction, temperatures, barometric pressures, and relative humidity shall be collected as part of the CAMP. Implementation and management procedures are specified within the CAMP. During all phases of work, the remedial contractor will be responsible for mitigating any vapor and particulate issues, via suppression techniques defined in the CAMP. CAMP Data must be provided to the NYSDEC and NYSDOH on a weekly basis, and any exceedances of CAMP action levels and corrective measures taken must be reported to the Departments immediately (within 24 -hours). SMP Template: December 2020 Site Management Plan, Site # C241214 13 ODOR CONTROL PLAN This odor control plan is capable of controlling emissions of nuisance odors off - site and on- site. Specific odor control methods to be used on a routine basis will include assigning a dedicated air monitoring technician to monitor odors, backfilling excavations in a timely manner, and maintaining covers over stockpiled impacted soils. If nuisance odors are identified at the site boundary, or if odor complaints are received, work will be halted and the source of odors will be identified and corrected. Work will not resume until all nuisance odors have been abated. NYSDEC and NYSDOH will be notified of all odor events and of any other complaints about the project. Implementation of all odor controls, including the halt of work, is the responsibility of the re medial party's Remediation Engineer, and any measures that are implemented will be discussed in the Periodic Review Report. All necessary means will be employed to prevent on- and off -site nuisances. At a minimum, these measures will include: (a) limiting the area of open excavations and size of soil stockpiles; (b) shrouding open excavations with tarps and other covers; and (c) using foams to cover exposed odorous soils. If odors develop and cannot be otherwise controlled, additional means to eliminate odo r nuisances will include: (d) direct load -out of soils to trucks for off -site disposal; (e) use of chemical odorants in spray or misting systems; and, (f) use of staff to monitor odors in surrounding neighborhoods. If nuisance odors develop during intrusive work that cannot be corrected, or where the control of nuisance odors cannot otherwise be achieved due to on- site conditions or close proximity to sensitive receptors, odor control will be achieved by sheltering the excavation and handling areas in a tem porary containment structure equipped with appropriate air venting/filtering systems. 14 DUST CONTROL PLAN Particulate monitoring must be conducted according to the Community Air Monitoring P lan (CAMP) provided in Section 12. If particulate levels at the site exceed the thresholds listed in the CAMP or if airborne dust is observed on the site or leaving the site, SMP Template: December 2020 Site Management Plan, Site # C241214 the dust suppression techniques listed below will be employed. The remedial party will also take measures listed below to prevent dust production on the site. A dust suppression plan that addresses dust management during invasive on- site work will include, at a minimum, the items listed below: Dust suppression will be achieved using a dedicated on -site water truck for road wetting. The truck will be equipped with a water cannon capable of spraying water directly onto off -road areas including excavations and stockpiles. Clearing and grubbing of larger sites will be done in stages to limit the area of exposed, unvegetated soils vulnerable to dust production. Gravel will be used on roadways to provide a clean and dust -free road surface. On-site roads will be limited in total area to minimize the area required for water truck sprinkling.

C. 4 3. Quality Assurance Objectives This section establishes the QA objectives for measurements that are critical to the project. The QA objectives are developed for relevant data quality indicators. These indicators include the method detection limit (MDL), reporting limit (RL) , precision, accuracy, completeness, representativeness, and comparability. The data quality objectives (DQOs) are based on project requirement s and ensure: (1) that the data generated during the project are of known quality and (2) that the quality is acceptable to achieve the project's technical objectives . Quantitation Limits are laboratory -specific and reflect those values achievable by the laboratory performing the analyses. However, to ensure that the analytical methodologies are capable of achieving the DQOs, measurement performance criteria have been set for the analytical measurements in terms of accuracy, precision, and completeness. The analytical methods to be used at this site will provide a level of data quality and can be used to evaluate potential impacts to soil, soil vapor, and groundwater compared to New York State Standards, Criteria and Guidance values, and for purposes of r isk assessment. The overall QA objective is to develop and implement procedures for field sampling, chain-of-custody, laboratory analysis, and reporting which will provide results that are scientifically valid, and the levels of which are sufficient to meet DQOs. Specific procedures for sampling, chain of custody, laboratory instruments calibration, laboratory analysis, reporting of data, internal quality control, and corrective action are described in other sections of the QAPP. The data quality indicators are presented in subsections 4.1 through 4.6. Procedures to assess the data quality indicators are given below in Section 10. The DQOs for soil samples for this project include minimum RLs specified within the 2005 NYSDEC ASP, as well as unrestricted use criteria listed in 6 New York Codes, Rules and Regulations (NYCRR) Part 375. 3.1 Required Quantification Limit The required quantif ication limit is the quantitative analytical level for individual analytes needed to make decisions relative to the objectives of the project. Quantitative limits may be expressed as the MDL or some quantitative level defined in terms relative to the program. It should be noted that there is some ambiguity in the definitions and use of terms that define quantification limits. The MDL presented herein is a well -defined and accepted entity, although attainable only under ideal laboratory conditions. 37-24 & 37- 28 30th Street Redevelopment Site Quality Assurance Project Plan 37-24 & 37- 28 30th Street Long Island City, New York NYSDEC BCP Number: C241214 November 2021 GEI Consultants, Inc. , P. C. 5 Method Detection Limit : The MDL is the minimum concentration of a substance that can be measured and reported with 99 percent confidence that the analyte concentration is greater than zero. MDL is determined from analysis of a sample in a given matrix type containing the analyte. Practical Quantitation Limit: The practical quantitation limit (PQL) (also referred to as the RL) is the concentration in the sample that corresponds to the lowest concentration standard of the calibration curve. 3.2 Accuracy Accuracy is the closeness of agreement between an observed value and an accepted reference value. The difference between the observed value and the reference value includes components of both systematic error (bias) and random error. Accuracy in the field is assessed through the adherence to all field instrument calibration procedures, sample handling, preservation, and holding time requirements, and through the collection of equipment blanks prior to the collection of samples for each type of equipment being used (e.g., sample liners, drilling shoe, or stainless-steel sampling implements). The laboratory will assess the overall accuracy of their instruments and analytical methods (independent of sample or matrix effects) through the measurement of \"standards,\" materia ls of accepted reference value. Accuracy will vary from analysis to analysis because of individual sample and matrix effects. In an individual analysis, accuracy will be measured in terms of blank results, the percent recovery (%R) of surrogate compounds in organic analyses, or %R of spiked compounds in matrix spikes (MS), matrix spike duplicates (MSD) and/or laboratory control samples (LCS ). This gives an indication of expected recovery for analytes tending to behave chemically like the spiked or surrogate compounds. 3.3 Precision Precision is the agreement among a set of replicate measurements without consideration of the \"true\" or accurate value: i.e., variability between measurements of the same material for the same analyte. In environmental sampling, precision is the result of field sampling and analytical factors. Precision in the laboratory is easier to measure and control than precision in the field. Replicate laboratory analyses of the same sample provide information on analytical precision; replicate field samples provide data on overall measurement precision. The difference between the overall measurement precision and the analytical precision is attributed to sampling precision. Precision is measured in a variety of ways including statistically, such as ca lculating variance or standard deviation. The difference between the overall measurement precision and the analytical precision is attributed to sampling precision. 37-24 & 37- 28 30th Street Redevelopment Site Quality Assurance Project Plan 37-24 & 37- 28 30th Street Long Island City, New York NYSDEC BCP Number: C241214 November 2021 GEI Consultants, Inc. , P. C. 6 Precision in the field is assessed through the collection and measurement of field duplicates. Field duplicates will be collected at a frequency of one per 20 investigative samples per matrix per analytical parameter, except for the waste characterization parameters. Precision will be measured through the calculation of re lative percent differences (RPD) as described in subsection 13.2. The resulting information will be used to assess sampling and analytical variability. Precision in the laboratory is assessed through the calculation of RPD for duplicate samples. For organic an alyses, laboratory precision will be assessed through the analysis of MS/MSD samples and field duplicates. For the inorganic analyses, laboratory precision will be assessed through the analysis of matrix duplicate pairs and field duplicate pairs. MS/MSD samples or matrix duplicate pairs will be performed at a frequency of one per 20 primary samples per matrix. Duplicate samples are described in subsection 5.1.2. Table 1 summarizes the number of duplicates required during completion of the RAWP end-point sampling . 3.4 Completeness Completeness is a measure of the amount of valid data obtained from a measurement system compared to the amount that was expected to be obtained under normal conditions. \"Normal conditions\" are defined as the conditions expected if the sampling plan was implemented as planned. The objective for completeness is a sufficient amount of valid data to achieve a predetermined statistical level of confidence. Critical samples must be identified, and plans must be formulated to secure requisite valid data for these samples. Field completeness is a measure of the amount of : 1) valid measurements obtained from all the measurements taken in the project and 2) valid samples collected. The field completeness objective is greater than 90 percent. Laboratory completeness is a measure of the amount of valid measurements obtained from all valid samples submitted to the laboratory. The laboratory completeness objective is greater than 95 percent. To ensure that these percentages are met, materials for crucial parameters will be retained if re- sampling is required and strict adherence to holding times will be required. 3.5 Representativeness Representativeness is a qualitative parameter that expresses the degree to which data accurately and precisely represents either a characteristic of a population, parameter variations at a sampling point, a process condition, or an environmental condition within a defined spatial and/or 37-24 & 37- 28 30th Street Redevelopment Site Quality Assurance Project Plan 37-24 & 37- 28 30th Street Long Island City, New York NYSDEC BCP Number: C241214 November 2021 GEI Consultants, Inc. , P. C. 7 temporal boundary. To ensure representativeness, the sampling locations have been selected to provide coverage over a wide area and to highlight potential trends in the data. Representativeness is dependent upon the proper design of the sampling program and will be satisfied by ensuring that any future work plans are followed, and that proper sampling, sample handling, and sample preservation techniques are used. Representativeness in the laboratory is ensured by using the proper analytical procedures, appropriate methods, and meeting sample-holding times. 3.6 Comparabilit y Comparability is a qualitative parameter that expresses the confidence with which one data set can be compared to another. Comparability is dependent upon the proper design of the sampling program and will be satisfied by ensuring that the R AWP is follo wed and that proper sampling techniques are used. Maximization of comparability with previous data sets is expected because the sampling design and field protocols are consistent with those previously used. Comparability is dependent on the use of recogni zed EPA or equivalent analytical methods and the reporting of data in standardized units. To facilitate data comparison, the data-reporting format as presented below will be used: Conventions (units reported as): for solids meter ( \u00b5g/m 3)]). Use common chemical name with corresponding chemical abstract s service (CAS) code . Report all data for soils on a dry-weight basis. 37-24 & 37- 28 30th Street Redevelopment Site Quality Assurance Project Plan 37-24 & 37- 28 30th Street Long Island City, New York NYSDEC BCP Number: C241214 November 2021 GEI Consultants, Inc. , P.

The frequency of soil vapor intrusion sampling will be as required by NYSDEC and NYSDOH. 4.1.3 Field QC Sample Collection Field QC samples are used to monitor the reproducibility and representativeness of field sampling activities. The field QC samples are handled , transported and analyzed in the same manner as the associated field samples. Field QC samples will include equipment blanks, trip blanks, field duplicates, and MS/MSDs. The quantity, field QC sample type and analysis is detailed in Table 1. 37-24 & 37- 28 30th Street Redevelopment Site Quality Assurance Project Plan 37-24 & 37- 28 30th Street Long Island City, New York NYSDEC BCP Number: C241214 November 2021 GEI Consultants, Inc. , P. C. 9 Equipment Blank Samples Equipment Blank Samples are used to monitor the adequacy of decontamination procedures and possible sources of contamination such as potential laboratory methodologies. Equipment blanks will consist of laboratory -supplied, distilled or de-ionized water and will be used to check for potential contamination of the equipment which may cause sample contamination. Equipment blanks will be collected b y routing the distilled water through a decontaminated piece of sampling equipment or disposable sampling equipment into laboratory supplied bottles. Non-dedicated field equipment will be decontaminated as specified below in subsection 6.2. Equipment blanks will be submitted to the laboratory at a frequency of one per 20 samples per matrix per type of equipment being used per parameter. Equipment blanks will not be completed for waste characterization sampling activities. Trip Blank Samples Trip Blank S amples will consist of analyte free water and will be prepared by the laboratory. Trip blanks are used to assess the potential for VOC contamination of samples due to contaminant migration during sample shipment and storage. Trip blanks will be transported to the project location unopened, stored with the site characterization samples, and kept closed until analyzed by the laboratory. Trip blanks will be submitted to the laboratory at a frequency of one per cooler which contains samples submitted for VOC analysis. Field Duplicate Samples Field Duplicate Samples , also referred to as blind duplicate samples, are two samples that are submitted from the same interval using the same sample procedures. Field duplicates will be used to assess the sampling and a nalytical reproducibility. Both samples are collected utilizing the same methods and are submitted for the same laboratory analysis however different sample identification numbers are used. Field duplicates will be submitted at a frequency of one per 20 samples for all matrices and all parameters. Field duplicates will not be completed for waste characterization sampling activities. MS/MSD Samples MS/MSD Samples are two additional aliquots of the same sample submitted for the same parameters as the orig inal sample. However, the additional aliquots are spiked with the compounds of concern. Matrix spikes provide information about the effect of the sample matrix on the measurement methodology. MS/MSDs will be submitted at a frequency of one per 20 investigative samples per matrix for organic and inorganic parameters. MS/MSDs will not be completed for waste characterization sampling activities. 37-24 & 37- 28 30th Street Redevelopment Site Quality Assurance Project Plan 37-24 & 37- 28 30th Street Long Island City, New York NYSDEC BCP Number: C241214 November 2021 GEI Consultants, Inc. , P.

Decontamination fluids will be containerized into United States Department of Transportation (USDOT )/United Nations ( UN)-approved 55-gallon drums or containment ves sels and will be characterized and disposed of by an approved disposal facility. 37-24 & 37- 28 30th Street Redevelopment Site Quality Assurance Project Plan 37-24 & 37- 28 30th Street Long Island City, New York NYSDEC BCP Number: C241214 November 2021 GEI Consultants, Inc. , P. C. 11 5. Documentation and Chain -of-Custody 5.1 Sample Collection Documentation 5.1.1 Field Notes Field notes documenting field activities will be maintained in a field notebook. Field logbooks will provide the means of recording the chronology of data collection activities performed during the investigation. The logbook will be a bound notebook with water-resistant pages. Logbook entries will be dated, legible, and contain accurate and inclusive documentation of the activity. No erasures or obliterations of field notes will be made. If an incorrect entry is made, the information will be crossed out with a single strike mark, which is signed and dated by the sampler. The correction shall be written adjacent to the error. Field logbooks will be reviewed at regular intervals by the field team leader, site manager, and project manager for completeness and representativeness. When necessary, logbooks will be supported by daily activity reports. 5.1.2 Chain-of-Custody (COC) Records Sample custody is discussed in detail below in subs ection 7.2. COC records are initiated by the samplers in the field. The field portion of the custody documentation should include: The project name; Signature(s) of sampler(s) responsible for sample custody; Sample ID number; Date and time of collection ; Whether the sample is grab or composite; Names of individuals involved in sampling; and Air bill or other shipping number (if applicable). On a regular basis (daily or on such a basis that all holding times will be met), samples will be transferred to the custody of the respective laboratories, via third- party commercial carriers or via laboratory courier service. Sample packaging and shipping procedures, and field COC procedures are described below in subsection 7.2.1 of this Plan. Sample receipt and log-in procedures at the laboratory are described below in subsection 7.2.2 of this Plan. 37-24 & 37- 28 30th Street Redevelopment Site Quality Assurance Project Plan 37-24 & 37- 28 30th Street Long Island City, New York NYSDEC BCP Number: C241214 November 2021 GEI Consultants, Inc. , P. C. 12 5.1.3 Sample Labeling Each sample will be labeled with a p re-printed adhesive label using indelible ink. The label should include the date and time of collection, sampler's initials, tests to be performed, preservative (if applicable), and a unique identification. The following identification scheme will be use d: PRIMARY SAMPLES TYPES QA/QC SAMPLE TYPES GROUNDWATER SAMPLES Monitoring Well -ID MW-P1 SOIL VAPOR INTRUSION SAMPLES Indoor/Outdoor Air Sampling Location- ID IA-1 Permanent Monitoring Point -ID VMP-1 FIELD ID -ID [XX] [DATE ] DUP -XX-03292018 This sample label contains the authoritative information for the sample. Inconsistencies with other documents will be settled in favor of the vial or container label unless otherwise corrected in writing from the field personnel collecting samples or the Data Manager and/or the Project QA Officer. 5.2 Sample Custody The COC provides a record of the custody of any environmental field sample from the time of collection to the delivery to the laboratory. Custody is one of several factors that are necessary for the admissibility of environmental data as evidence in a court of law. Custody procedures help to satisfy the two major requirements for admissibility: relevance and authenticity. Sample custody is addressed in three parts: field sample collection, laboratory analysis, and final evidence files. A sample is un der a per son's custody if: The item is in the actual possession of a person The item is in the view of the person after being in actual possession of the person The item was in the actual physical possession of the person and is locked up to prevent tampering The item is in a designated and identified secure area 37-24 & 37- 28 30th Street Redevelopment Site Quality Assurance Project Plan 37-24 & 37- 28 30th Street Long Island City, New York NYSDEC BCP Number: C241214 November 2021 GEI Consultants, Inc. , P. C. 13 5.2.1 Field Custody Procedures Samples will be collected following the sampling procedures described in the RAWP . A summary of samples and collection methods are provided above in Section 5 of this QAPP . Documentation of sample collection is described above in subsection 7.1. Sample COC and packaging procedures are summarized below. These procedures will ens ure that the samples will arrive at the laboratory with the COC intact. The field sampler is personally responsible for the care and custody of the samples until they are transferred or dispatched properly. Field procedures have been designed such that as few people as possible will handle the samples. All bottles will be identified using sample labels with sample numbers, sampling locations, date/time of collection, and type of analysis. The sample numbering system is presented above in subsection 7.1.3. Sample labels will be completed for each sample using waterproof ink unless prohibited by weather conditions. Samples will be accompanied by a completed COC form. The sample numbers and locations will be listed on the COC form. When transferring the pos session of samples, the individuals relinquishing and receiving will sign, date, and note the time on the record. This record documents the transfer of custody of samples from the sampler to another person, to a mobile laboratory, and to the laboratory fa cility . All shipments will be accompanied by the COC record identifying the contents. The original record will accompany the shipment, and copies will be retained by the sampler and provided to the data manager and placed in the project files. Samples will be properly packaged for shipment and dispatched to the appropriate laboratory for analysis, with a separate signed custody record enclosed in and secured to the inside top of each sample box or cooler. Shipping containers will be secured with strapping tape and custody seals for shipment to the laboratory. The custody seals will be attached to the cooler and covered with clear plastic tape after being signed by field personnel. If the samples are sent by common carrier, the air bill will be used. Air bills will be retained as part of the permanent documentation. Commercial carriers are not required to sign off on the custody forms since the custody forms will be sealed inside the sample cooler and the custody seals will remain intact. Samples remain i n the custody of the sampler until transfer of custody is completed. This consists of delivery of samples to the laboratory sample custodian, and signature of the laboratory sample custodian on COC document as receiving the samples and signature of sample r as relinquishing samples. 37-24 & 37- 28 30th Street Redevelopment Site Quality Assurance Project Plan 37-24 & 37- 28 30th Street Long Island City, New York NYSDEC BCP Number: C241214 November 2021 GEI Consultants, Inc. , P.

C. 19 10. Corrective Action If unacceptable conditions are identified as a result of audits or are observed during field sampling and analysis, the PM, Field Team Leader, and QA officer will document the condition and initiate corrective procedures. The specific condition or problem will be identified, its cause will be determined, and appropriate action will be implemented. The entire sampling program will be under the direction of the PM and QA officer. The emphasis in this program is on preventing problems by identifying potential errors, discrepancies, and gaps in the data collection, laboratory analysis, and interpretation process. Any problems identified will be promptly resolved. Likewise, follow-up corrective action is always an option in the event that preventative corrective actions are not effective. The acceptance limits for the sampling and analyses to be conducted in this program will be those stated in the method or defined by other means in the Work Plan. Corrective actions are likely to be immediate in nature and most often will be implemented by the contracted laboratory analyst or the PM . The corrective action will usually involve recalculation, reanalysis, or repeating a sample run. 10.1 Immediate Corrective Action Corrective action in the field may be needed when the sample requirements are changed (i.e., more/less samples, sampling locations other than those specified in the Work Plan), or when sampling procedures and/or field analytical procedures require modification, etc. due to unexpected conditions. The field team may identify the need for corrective action. The Field Team Leader, Site Manager, and PM will approve the corrective action and notify the QA officer. The PM and QA officer will approve the correct ive measure. The Field Team Leader and Site Manager will ensure that the corrective measure is implemented by the field team. Corrective actions will be implemented and documented in the field record book. Documentation will include: A description of the circumstances that initiated the corrective action The action taken in response The final resolution Any necessary approvals Corrective action in the laboratory will be completed in accordance with the quality assurance procedures. Any corrective actions completed by the laboratory will be documented in both the 37-24 & 37- 28 30th Street Redevelopment Site Quality Assurance Project Plan 37-24 & 37- 28 30th Street Long Island City, New York NYSDEC BCP Number: C241214 November 2021 GEI Consultants, Inc. , P. C. 20 laboratory's corrective action files, and the narrative data report sent from the laboratory to the PM. If the corrective action does not rectify the situation, the laboratory w ill contact the PM, who will determine the action to be taken and inform the appropriate personnel.

Background Project Name: 37-24 & 37-28 30th Street Redevelopment Site Project Location: 37-24 and 37-28 30th Street, Long Island City, NY GEI Project No: 1800522 This Health and Safety Plan (HASP) establishes policies and procedures to protect GEI Consultants, Inc. (GEI) personnel from the potential hazards posed by the activities at the 37- 24 an d 37-28 30th Street site in Long Island City, New York . Reading of the HASP is required of on-site GEI personnel and will be reviewed by GEI subcontractors. Subcontractors will prepare their own s ite-specific HASP and may use this as a guide. The plan identifies measures to minimize accidents and injuries, which may result from project activities or during adverse weather conditions. A copy of this HASP will be maintained on site for the duration of the work. Included in Section 1 and Appendix A is a route to the nearest medical facility from the site with directions and contact information. S afety data sheets (SDS) , specific to chemicals that may be encountered while working at the site , are in Appendix B. Appendix C details the signs, symptoms, care and procedures to both heat and cold stress. Appendix D includes the Tailgate Safety Briefing form, the Project Safety Briefing form, the Accident/Incident Report Form and the Near Miss Reporting F orm. Appendix E contains the GEI Health and Safety (H&S) S tandard Operating P rocedures (SOPs) that apply to this project. Also included in Appendix E is the COVID-19 Field Work Guidance. 2.1 Site Description The site is located in Long Island City, Queens County, New York and is identified as Block 371 and Lots 33 and 34 on the New York City Tax Map. The site is an approximately 0.368- acre area and is bounded by a two-story office building to the north, an auto repair shop and two residential houses to the south, 30th Street to the east, and Old Ridge Road to the west. The owner(s) of the site parcels at the time of issuance of th e SMP is 37 -26 30th Street LLC. The Site was historically used for dry cleaning and auto repair commercial businesses. The Site currently consists of the following: two seven-story residential buildings constructed in 2021. 2.2 Scope of Field Work The scope of field work covered under this HASP includes the site management activities to be implemented in accordance with the Site Management Plan (SMP ).

GEI Health and Safety Policy GEI is committed to providing a safe and healthy work environment for its employees. To maintain a safe work environment, GEI has established an organizational structure and a Corporate Health and Safety Program to promote the following objectives: Reduce the risk of injury, illness, and loss of life to GEI employees. Maintain compliance with federal, state, and other applicable safety regulations; and minimize GEI employees' work exposure to potential physical, chemical, biological, and radiological hazards. Safety policy and procedure on any one project cannot be administered, implemented, monitored, and enforced by any one individual. The total objective of a safe, accident free work environment can only be accomplished by a dedicated, concerted effort by every individual involved with the project from management down to all employees. Each GEI employee must understand their value to the company; the costs of accidents, both monetary, physical, and emotional; the objective of the safety policy and procedures; the safety rules that apply to the safety policy and procedures; and what their individual role is in administering, implementing, monitoring, and compliance of their safety policy and procedures. This allows for a more personal approach to compliance through planning, training, understanding, and cooperative effort, rather than by strict enforcement. If for any reason an unsafe act persists, strict enforcement will be implemented.

Use spotter to provide assistance if available. Use proper lifting techniques. Keep trafficked areas free from slip/trip/fall hazards. Use extreme caution when climbing on and around the system. Slipping inside the system operations area can cause significant bodily injury due to contact with metal parts or due to twisting, or turning body parts . When working on surfaces 6 feet or more above ground a guardrail system will be used where installed. Where guardrail systems are not installed, personal fall arrest system must be used. A Fall Protection Matrix is also required when using fall protection equipment. Propane tanks are potential sources for fire and explosion. Never fill propane tanks within 25 feet of an open ignition source. A fully charged, 20 lb. fire extinguisher must be available for immediate use on site at all times. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is the initial level of protection based on the activity hazards and site conditions which have been identified. Upgrades to respiratory protection may be required based on the designated Action L evels found in Section 9. If site conditions suggest the existence of a situation more hazardous than anticipated, the site personnel will evacuate the immediate area. The hazard, the level of precautions, and the PPE will then be reevaluated with the assistance and approval of the Safety Director and the Project Manager (PM). 4.3 Personal Safety Field activities have the potential to take employees into areas which may pose a risk to personal safety. The following websites (sources) have been researched to identify potential crime activity in the are a of the project: https://www1.nyc.gov/site/nypd/stats/crime -statistics/citywide -crime -stats.page : Crimes in NYPD 114 th Precinct have increased in recent years (e.g. Year to Date Long Island City is 436 total crimes, which is a 14.44 percent increase over the previous year and a 7.39 percent change ov er two years). Health and Safety Plan 37-24 & 37- 28 30th Street Redevelopment Site 37-24 and 37-2 8 30th Street Long Island City, NY November 2021 GEI Consultants, Inc. 12 2020 Template To protect yourself, take the following precautions: If deemed necessary by the PM, use the buddy system (teams of a minimum of two persons present); Let the Site Safety Manager (SSM) know when you begin work in these areas and when you l eave; Call in regularly; Pay attention to what is going on around you; and If you arrive in an area and it does not look safe to get out of your vehicle, lock the doors and drive off quickly but safely. Employees must not knowingly enter into a situation where there is the potential for physical and violent behaviors to occur. If employees encounter hostile individuals or a confrontation develops in the work area, suspend work activities, immediately leave the area of concern, and contact local 911 for assistance. Notify the SSM and Safety Team (Safety Director and Regional Safety Managers - SafetyTeam@geiconsultants.com ) of any incidents once you are out of potential danger. In the event of an emergency, prompt communications with local emergency responders is essential. At least one charged and otherwise functioning cell phone to facilitate emergency communications will be on -site. Confirmation of cellular phone operation will be confirmed at the start of each working day. 4.3.1 Coronavirus (COVID-19) GEI field employees will follow the COVID -19 Field Guidance in Appendix E. Distancing COVID-19 spreads from person- to-person primarily through droplets that are emitted from the initial person to a distance of 6 feet. Maintain a distance of at least 6 feet (2 meters) from others. This includes during site meetings and breaks and while performing work tasks. Meetings should be held outside or by phone/video. Minimize the number of employees in one location to the extent possible. Follow local restrictions for maximum number of people congregated in one location at a time. If tasks need to be performed cl ose to others (within 6 feet) and that cannot be avoided, wear appropriate PPE including a face mask (surgical or cloth), gloves, and eye protection. Health and Safety Plan 37-24 & 37- 28 30th Street Redevelopment Site 37-24 and 37- 28 30th Street Long Island City, NY November 2021 GEI Consultants, Inc. 13 2020 Template NOTE: Face masks are not a substitute for distancing. Masks are meant to protect others in case you are infected. Contact the Safety Team (safetyteam@geiconsultants.com) to discuss any special circumstances and the PPE warranted. Wear nitrile gloves as much as practicable and change them frequently. As practicable, wash your hands or use sanitizer between glove changes. Wash your hands after wearing gloves. Minimize and stagger time in office spaces to performing essential duties such as picking up and dropping off equipment and samples. If you need to spend more time in a project office (e.g., a construction trailer), it's important that the workspace allows for proper social distancing. When traveling to project sites, travel in separate vehicles. Do not travel in the same vehicle. Hygiene Practices The hygiene practices we have been instructed to perform more routinely apply to performing field work as well, such as: Frequent hand washing with soap and warm water for 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available, use hand sanitizer (contai ning 60% alcohol) until soap and water can be used. If sanitizer is not available, bringing gallon containers of water and soap may be a good substitute. If you are filling water bottles (for drinking or hand washing) keep the bottle away from the spigot to avoid transfer of germs or contaminants. Wipe down surfaces with disinfectant on a routine basis (at least once per day). This includes field equipment and other items that may have previously been used by others. This is especially important while working in construction trailers. When using company and personal vehicles, wipe surfaces including the steering wheel, gear shifter, controls, and door handles before and after use. Wear nitrile gloves as frequently as possible. Hand washing is necessary af ter removing gloves. When greeting others avoid handshaking, hugging, or other personal contact. A greeting from a distance such as a wave is suggested. Avoid sharing field equipment and other materials with others. Before using field equipment or putting it away, wipe it down with disinfectant or wash it with soap and water. Note, use extra caution using disinfectants while collecting environmental samples to ensure that the samples are not compromised. Health and Safety Plan 37-24 & 37- 28 30th Street Redevelopment Site 37-24 and 37- 28 30th Street Long Island City, NY November 2021 GEI Consultants, Inc. 14 2020 Template 4.3.2 Excavations and Trenches The safety requirements fo r excavations and trenches must be determined by a competent person who is capable of identifying existing and predictable hazards and work conditions that are unsanitary, hazardous, or dangerous to GEI employees. The competent person must also have the authorization to take prompt corrective measures to eliminate unsatisfactory conditions. GEI employees will not enter trenches. The following are general requirements for work activities in and around excavations: Prior to initiation of excavation activity (or ground intrusive activity, such as drilling), the location of underground installations will be determined. The <One- Call/Dig -Safe> center will be contacted by the Contractor/Subcontractor a minimum of 72 hours prior to excavation activities. It may also be necessary to temporarily support underground utilities during excavation. When excavations approach the estimated location of underground installations, the exact location of the underground installations will be determined by means that are sa fe for GEI employees , i.e., hand dig, test pits, etc. Excavations should be inspected daily by the excavating company's competent person prior to commencement of work activities. Evidence of cave-ins, slides, sloughing, or surface cracks or excavations will be cause for work to cease until necessary precautions are taken to safeguard employees. Excavated and other materials or equipment that could fall or roll into the excavation, and vehicular traffic and heavy equipment will be placed at least 5 feet fro m the edge of the excavation. Excavation operations will cease immediately during hazardous weather conditions such as high winds, heavy rain, lightning, and heavy snow. Employees will refer to GEI's Excavation Safety SOP for further information. 4.3.3 Heat Stress Employees may be exposed to the hazards associated with heat stress when ambient temperatures exceed 70\u00baF. Employees should increase water intake while working in conditions of high heat. Enough water should be available so that each employee can consume 1 quart of water per hour. In addition, they should increase number of rest breaks and/or rotate employees in shorter work shifts. Employees should r est in cool, dry, shaded areas for at least 5 minutes . Employees should not wait until they feel sick to cool down. Watch for signs and symptoms of heat exhaustion and fatigue. In the event of heat stroke, bring the victim to a cool environment, call for help, and initiate first aid procedures Health and Safety Plan 37-24 & 37- 28 30th Street Redevelopment Site 37-24 and 37- 28 30th Street Long Island City, NY November 2021 GEI Consultants, Inc. 15 2020 Template The procedures to be followed regarding avoiding heat stress are provided in Appendix C - Heat Stress Guidelines and in GEI's Heat Stress program. 4.3.4 Cold Stress Employees may be exposed to the hazards of working in cold environments. Potential hazards in cold environments include frostbite, trench foot or immersion foot, hypothermia, as well as slippery surfaces, brittle equipment, and poor judgment. The procedures to be followed regar ding avoiding cold stress are provided in Appendix C - Cold Stress Guidelines and in GEI's Cold Stress program. 4.3.5 Noise Noise is a potential hazard associated with the operation of heavy equipment, power tools, pumps, and generators. Employees who will perform suspected or established high noise tasks and operations will wear hearing protection. If deemed necessary by the SSM, the Safety Director will be consulted on the need for additional hearing protection and the need to monitor sound levels for site activities. Other employees who do not need to be in proximity of the noise should distance themselves from the equipment generating the noise. 4.3.6 Hand and Power Tools In order to complete the various tasks for the project, personnel may use hand and power tools. The use of hand and power tools can present a variety of hazards, including physical harm from being struck by flying objects, being cut or struck by the tool, fire, and electrocution. Work gloves, safety glasses, and hard hats will be worn by the operating personnel when using hand and power tools and Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter (GFCI)- equipped circuits will be used for power tools. 4.3.7 Slips, Trips, and Falls Working in and around the site may pose slip, trip, and fall hazards due to slippery and uneven surfaces. Excavation at the site may cause uneven footing in trenches and around the soil piles. Steep slope and uneven terrain conditions at the site are also a primary concern. GEI employees will wear prope r foot gear and will employ good work practice and housekeeping procedures to minimize the potential for slips, trips, and falls. 4.3.8 Manual Lifting Manual lifting of objects and equipment may be required. Failure to follow proper lifting technique can result in back injuries and strains. Employees should use a buddy system and/or power equipment to lift heavy loads whenever possible and should evaluate loads before trying to lift them (i.e., they should be able to easily tip the load and then return it to Health and Safety Plan 37-24 & 37- 28 30th Street Redevelopment Site 37-24 and 37- 28 30th Street Long Island City, NY November 2021 GEI Consultants, Inc. 16 2020 Template its original position). Carrying heavy loads with a buddy and proper lifting techniques include: 1) make sure footing is solid; 2) make back straight with no curving or slouching; 3) center body over feet; 4) grasp the object firmly and as close to your body as possible; 5) lift with legs; and 6) turn with your feet, don't twist. 4.4 Chemical Hazards The characteristics of compounds at the site are discussed below for information purposes. Adherence to the safety and health guidelines in this HASP should reduce the potential for exposure to the compounds discussed below. Chlorinated Hydrocarbons Chlorinated hydrocarbons (organochlorides) are a very large and diverse group of hydrocarbon molecules that also have at least one covalently bound chlorine atom chemic ally bonded to them. Chlorinated hydrocarbons are used predominantly as solvents and have historically been used as industrial degreasers, dry cleaning solvents, anesthetic agents and as refrigerants. They are colorless, volatile liquids with a moderately sweet aroma and partially soluble in but denser than water. They are the most common DNAPL. The more common forms of chlorinated solvent contamination of soils and ground waters include: Tetrachloroethene chloride) As a class, the chlorinate d hydrocarbons are potent central nervous system depressants or stimulants. They also cause greater liver and kidney damage compared to other organic solvents. Many have been shown to cause cancer in laboratory animals; due to widespread industrial use, the issue of carcinogenic risk to humans is one of the most controversial issues in regulatory toxicology. Exposure to chlorinated hydrocarbon compounds in the occupational setting is primarily through inhalation. Skin absorption is variable and usually insignificant, although dermal absorption following prolonged or extensive skin contact can cause systemic toxicity. Health and Safety Plan 37-24 & 37- 28 30th Street Redevelopment Site 37-24 and 37- 28 30th Street Long Island City, NY November 2021 GEI Consultants, Inc. 17 2020 Template Heavy Metals Exposure to high concentrations of arsenic can cause dermatitis, gastrointestinal disturbances, peripheral neuropathy, respiratory irritation, and hyper pigmentation of skin. Chronic exposure to arsenic has resulted in lung cancer in humans. Exposure to high concentrations of aluminum can cause irritation of the eyes, skin, and the respiratory system. Exposure to high concentrations of antimony can cause irritation of eyes, skin, nose, throat, and mouth; coughing; dizziness; headache; nausea, vomiting, diarrhea; stomach cramps; insomnia; anorexia; and could be unable to smell properly. Chronic exposure to antimony can produce respiratory effects that include antimony pneumoconiosis (inflammation of the lungs due to irritation caused by the inhalation of dust), alterations in pulmonary function, chronic bronchitis, chronic emphysema, inactive tuberculosis, pleural adhesions, irri tation; cardiovascular effects (increased blood pressure, altered EKG readings and heart muscle damage) and gastrointestinal disorders in humans. Exposure to high concentrations of beryllium can result in \"beryllium sensitization\" which is an allergic r esponse to beryllium. Symptoms of the disease include cough shortness of breath fatigue fevers skin rash and night sweats. In the later stages lung tissue becomes scarred. In severe cases the right side of the heart may be strained due to increased pressure in the pulmonary artery from lung damage. Exposure to high concentrations of cadmium can cause acute symptoms such as pulmonary edema, dyspnea (breathing difficulty), cough, chest tightness and pain; headache; chills, muscle aches; nausea, vomiti ng, diarrhea; loss of the sense of smell), mild anemia; and is considered a potential occupational carcinogen. Exposure to chromium can cause acute symptoms such as irritation of the eyes, nose and throat as well as wheezing and coughing. Chronic effects include nosebleeds, nasal congestion, dermatitis, and loss of sight. Exposure to high concentrations of copper through inhalation can cause irritation of the eyes, nose, pharynx, nasal septum. Ingestion may cause a metallic taste. Skin irritation may r esult from direct contact with skin. Damage to the liver and kidneys may occur. No adverse health effects are associated with environmental exposure to iron. Target organs for iron via ingestion of iron (most often in supplement form) are the liver, cardiovascular system, and kidneys. Exposure to high concentrations of iron through ingestion can cause salivation nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain.

Exposure to mercury can cause dizziness, salivation nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, emotional disturbance, and kidney injury. Chronic exposure to mercury can cause CNS damage. Exposure to high concentrations of selenium can cause mucous membrane irritation, coughing, sneezing, shortness of breath, chills, headaches, hypotension, and CNS depression. Chronic exposure to selenium could cause bronchial irritation, gastrointestinal distress, excessive fatigue, and skin discoloration. Exposure to high concentrations of thallium can cause nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain, vomiting; tremor; chest pain, pulmonary edema; convulsions, psychosis; and alopecia. Vanadium may cause greenish-black discoloration of the tongue, and is possibly carcinogenic to humans. Long-term or repeated exposure to vanadium may have effects on the respiratory tract, result ing in chronic rhinitis and chronic bronchitis. Exposure to high concentrations of zinc through ingestion can cause abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Chronic exposure can lead to low blood pressure, jaundice, and seizures. These metals are at environmental concentrations and are not expected to be at concentrations that exposure symptoms would occur. As with SVOCs, the primary route of exposure is through inhalation of dust particles when soil is disturbed and becomes airborne. 4.4.1 Evaluation of Organic Vapor Exposure Air monitoring reduces the risk of overexposure by indicating when action levels have been exceeded and wh en PPE must be upgraded or changed.

Therefore, employees working on this project should be aware of the potential biological hazards at this site. Each is discussed in detail below: 4.5.1 Ticks Lyme Disease Ticks are bloodsuckers, attaching themselves to warm-blooded vertebrates to feed. Deer ticks are associated with the transmission the bacteria that causes Lyme disease. Female deer ticks are about \u00bc-inch in length and are black and brick red in color. Males are smaller and all black. If a tick is not removed, or if the tick is allowe d to remain for days feeding on human blood, a condition known as tick paralysis can develop. This is due to a neurotoxin, which the tick apparently injects while engorging. This neurotoxin acts upon the spinal cord causing incoordination, weakness, and paralysis. The early stages of Lyme disease, which can develop within a week to a few weeks of the tick bite, are usually marked by one or more of these signs and symptoms: Tiredness Chills and fever Headache Muscle and/or join pain Swollen lymph glands Characteristic skin rash (i.e. bullseye rash) Prevention Tick season lasts from April through October; peak season is May through July. You can reduce your risk by taking these precautions: During outside activities, wear long sleeves and long pants tucked into socks. Wear a hat, and tie hair back. Use insecticides to repel or kill ticks. Repellents containing the compound n,n- diethyl- meta -toluamide (DEET) can be used on exposed skin except for the face, but they do not kill ticks and are not 100% effective in discouraging ticks from biting. Products containing permethrin kill ticks, but they cannot be used on the skin -- only on clothing. When using any of these chemicals, follow label directions carefully. Health and Safety Plan 37-24 & 37- 28 30th Street Redevelopment Site 37-24 and 37- 28 30th Street Long Island City, NY November 2021 GEI Consultants, Inc. 26 2020 Template After outdoor activities, perform a tick chec k. Check body areas where ticks are commonly found: behind the knees, between the fingers and toes, under the arms, in and behind the ears, and on the neck, hairline, and top of the head. Check places where clothing presses on the skin. Remove attached ticks promptly. Removing a tick before it has been attached for more than 24 hours greatly reduces the risk of infection. Use tweezers and grab as closely to the skin as possible. Do not try to remove ticks by squeezing them, coating them with petroleu m jelly, or burning them with a match. Keep ticks in a zip-lock baggie in case testing needs to be performed. Report any of the above symptoms and all tick bites to the PM and Safety Team for evaluation. 4.5.2 Mosquito- Borne Disease - West Nile Virus West Nil e encephalitis is an infection of the brain caused by the West Nile virus, which is transmitted by infected mosquitoes. Following transmission from an infected mosquito, West Nile virus multiplies in the person's blood system and crosses the blood-brain barrier to reach the brain. The virus interferes with normal CNS functioning and causes inflammation of the brain tissue. However, most infections are mild, and symptoms include fever, headache, and body aches. More severe infections may be marked by headache, high fever, neck stiffness, stupor, disorientation, coma, tremors, convulsions, muscle weakness, paralysis , and rarely, death. Persons over the age of 50 have the highest risk of severe disease. Prevention centers on public health action to control mosquitoes and on individual action to avoid mosquito bites. To avoid being bitten by the mosquitoes that cause the disease, use the following control measures: If possible, stay inside between dusk and dark. This is when mosquitoes are most active. When outside (between dusk and dark), wear long pants and long- sleeved shirts. Spray exposed skin with an insect repellent, preferably containing DEET. 4.5.3 Wasps and Bees Wasps (hornets and yellow-jackets) and bees (honeybees and bumblebees) are common insects that may pose a potential hazard to the field team if work is performed during spring, summer , or fall. Bees normally build their nests in the soil. However, they use other natural holes such as abandoned rodent nests or tree hollows. Wasps make a football -shaped, paper- like nest either below or above the ground. Yellow -jackets tend to build their nests in the ground, but hornets tend to build their nests in trees and shrubbery. Bees are generally more mild-mannered than wasps and are less likely to sting. Bees can only sting once while wasps sting multiple times because their stinger is barbless. Wasps sting when they feel threatened.

Wasps and bees inject a venomous fluid under the skin when they sting. The venom causes a painful swelling that may last for several days. If the stinger is still present, carefully remove it with tweezers. Some people may develop an allergic reaction (i.e. anaphylact ic shock) to a wasp or bee sting. If such a reaction develops, seek medical attention at once. If a GEI employee is allergic to bees or wasps notify the SSM and if, needed, the location of the epi pen. 4.5.4 Sun Exposure Employees are encouraged to liberally apply sunscreen, with a minimum broad-spectrum sun protection factor (SPF) of 30, when working outdoors to avoid sunburn and potential skin cancer, which is associated with excessive sun exposure to unprotected skin. Additionally, employees should wear safety glasses that offer protection from ultraviolet A and B (UVA/UVB) rays.

GEI's Safety Director and is responsible for the administration and coordination of medical evaluations conducted for GEI's employees at branch office locations. Comprehensive examinations are given to GEI field personnel on an annual or biennial basis (as determined to be appropriate by the Safety Director ) participating in hazardous waste operations. The medical results of the examinations aid in determining the overall fitness of employees participating in field activities. Under the Safety Director 's supervision, field personnel undergo a complete initial physical examination, including a detailed medical and occupational history, before they participate in hazardous waste site investigations. Extensive annual/biennial reexaminations are also performed. Upon completion of these tests, personnel ar e certified by an occupational health physician as to whether they are fit for field work in general and fit to use respiratory protection. If a GEI employee or other project worker shows symptoms of exposure to a hazardous substance and wishes to be rechecked, he/she will be directed to the nearest area hospital or medical facility. GEI subcontractor personnel that will enter any active waste handling or other active non-\"clean\" area must certify that they are participating in a medical surveillance pro gram that complies with OSHA regulations for hazardous waste operations (i.e., 29 CFR 1910.120 and 29 CFR 1926.65).

Atmospheric Monitoring Air m onitoring will be performed to identify and quantify airborne levels of hazardous substances and safety and health hazards in order to determine the appropriate level of worker protection needed on- site in the event that intrusive work is conducted. Work requiring air monitoring includes the installation and/or abandonment of monitoring wells, DNAPL recovery wells, oxygen injection wells, and soil vapor points. Additionally, PID screening of the well head space will be conducted during groundwater sampling a ctivities. GEI will conduct work zone monitoring for on- site GEI employees during intrusive activities only. GEI will monitor and document daily site conditions and operations and inform field representatives of results. If Action Levels are exceeded, the SS M will immediately implement site action(s) according to Table 6 below and notify the PM and Safety Team . The following air monitoring equipment will be on site : PID with 10.6 eV lamp or equivalent Particulate Meter (PM -10 capable) 9.1 Equipment Use 9.1.1 Calibration Air monitoring equipment will b e calibrated and maintained in accordance with manufacturer's requirements. Calibrations will be recorded in the project notes daily or on a daily calibration form. 9.1.2 Photoionization Detector Organic vapor concentrations will be measured using a PID during intrusive activities. During intrusive operations, organic vapor concentrations will be measured continuously. Organic vapor concentrations will be measured upwind of the work site(s) to determine background concentrations at least twice a day, (once in the morning and once in the afternoon). The SSM will interpret monitoring results using professional judgment and according to the alert and Action L imits set forth in the associated Site Work P lan. 9.2 Particulate Meter A particulate meter will be used to me asure airborne particulate matter during intrusive activities.

VOCs include a variety of chemicals, some of which may have short- and long-term adverse health effects. Concentrations of many VOCs are consistently higher indoors (up to ten times higher) than outdoors. VOCs are emitted by a wide array of products numbering in the thousands. Organic chemicals are widely used as ingredients in household products. Paints, varnishesand wax all contain organic solvents, as do many cleaning, disinfecting, cosmetic, degreasing and hobby products. Fuels are made up of organic chemicals. All of these products can release organic compounds while you are using them, and, to some degree, when they are stored. EPA's Office of Research and Development's \"Total Exposure Assessment Methodology (TEAM) Study\" (V olumes I through IV , completed in 1985) found levels of about a dozen common organic pollutants to be 2 to 5 times higher inside homes than outside, regardless of whether the homes were located in rural or highly industrial areas. TEAM studies indicated that while people are using products containing organic chemicals, they can expose themselves and others to very high pollutant levels, and elevated concentrations can persist in the air long after the activity is completed. Sources of VOCs Household products, including:paints, paint strippersand other solvents wood preservatives aerosol sprays cleansers and disinfectants moth repellents and air fresheners stored fuels and automotive products hobby supplies dry-cleaned clothing pesticide Other products, including: building materials and furnishings office equipment such as copiers and printers, correction fluids and carbonless copy paper graphics and craft materials including glues and adhesives, permanent markers and photographic solutions. Health Effects Health effects may include: Eye, nose and throat irritation headaches, loss of coordination and nausea damage to liver, kidney and central nervous system Some organics can cause cancer in animals, some are suspected or known to cause cancer in humans. Key signs or symptoms associated with exposure to VOCs include: conjunctival irritation nose and throat discomfort headache allergic skin reaction dyspnea declines in serum cholinesterase levels nausea emesis epistaxis fatigue dizziness The ability of organic chemicals to cause health effects varies greatly from those that are highly toxic, to those with no known health effect. As with other pollutants, the extent and nature of the health effect will depend on many factors including level of exposure and length of time exposed. Among the immediate symptoms that some people have experienced soon after exposure to some organics include: Eye and respiratory tract irritation headaches dizziness visual disorders and memory impairment At present, not much is known about what health effects occur from the levels of organics usually found in homes.Search EPA's Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) A compilation of electronic reports on specific substances found in the environment and their potential to cause human health effects EPA's Office of Drinking Water Regulations List of Contaminants and Their MCLs: Organic Chemicals U.S. Geology Survey's National Water-Quality Assessment (NAWQA) ProgramInformation on VOCs in Water Sources Levels in Homes Studies have found that levels of several organics average 2 to 5 times higher indoors than outdoors. During and for several hours immediately after certain activities, such as paint stripping, levels may be 1,000 times background outdoor levels. Steps to Reduce Exposure Increase ventilation when using products that emit VOCs. Meet or exceed any label precautions. Do not store opened containers of unused paints and similar materials within the school. Formaldehyde, one of the best known VOCs, is one of the few indoor air pollutants that can be readily measured.Identify, and if possible, remove the source. If not possible to remove, reduce exposure by using a sealant on all exposed surfaces of paneling and other furnishings.Use integrated pest management techniques to reduce the need for pesticides.Use household products according to manufacturer's directions. Make sure you provide plenty of fresh air when using these products. Throw away unused or little-used containers safely buy in quantities that you will use soon.Keep out of reach of children and pets. Never mix household care products unless directed on the label. Follow label instructions carefully. Potentially hazardous products often have warnings aimed at reducing exposure of the user. For example, if a label says to use the product in a well-ventilated area, go outdoors or in areas equipped with an exhaust fan to use it. Otherwise, open up windows to provide the maximum amount of outdoor air possible. Throw away partially full containers of old or unneeded chemicals safely. Because gases can leak even from closed containers, this single step could help lower concentrations of organic chemicals in your home. (Be sure that materials you decide to keep are stored not only in a well-ventilated area but are also safely out of reach of children.) Do not simply toss these unwanted products in the garbage can. Find out if your local government or any organization in your community sponsors special days for the collection of toxic household wastes. If such days are available, use them to dispose of the unwanted containers safely. If no such collection days are available, think about organizing one. Buy limited quantities. If you use products only occasionally or seasonally, such as paints, paint strippers and kerosene for space heaters or gasoline for lawn mowers, buy only as much as you will use right away. Keep exposure to emissions from products containing methylene chloride to a minimum. Consumer products that contain methylene chloride include paint strippers, adhesive removers and aerosol spray paints. Methylene chloride is known to cause cancer in animals. Also, methylene chloride is converted to carbon monoxide in the body and can cause symptoms associated with exposure to carbon monoxide. Carefully read the labels containing health hazard information and cautions on the proper use of these products. Use products that contain methylene chloride outdoors when possible use indoors only if the area is well ventilated. Keep exposure to benzene to a minimum. Benzene is a known human carcinogen. The main indoor sources of this chemical are:environmental tobacco smoke stored fuels paint supplies automobile emissions in attached garages Actions that will reduce benzene exposure include: eliminating smoking within the home providing for maximum ventilation during painting discarding paint supplies and special fuels that will not be used immediately Keep exposure to perchloroethylene emissions from newly dry-cleaned materials to a minimum. Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Recent studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned goods are stored and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can save money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pressing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to minimize your exposure to this chemical is prudent.If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up, do not accept them until they have been properly dried.If goods with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent visits, try a different dry cleaner.

Last updated on May 16, 2016I:\\Tech \\HASP Appendices\\ Phase II \\More recent SDS s\\SVOCs List.docx CAS # This fact sheet answers the most frequently asked health questions (FAQs) about polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). For more information, call the CDC Information Center at 1-800-232-4636. This fact sheet is one in a series of summaries about hazardous substances and their health effects. This information is important because this substance may harm you. The effects of exposure to any hazardous substance depend on the dose, the duration, how you are exposed, personal traits and habits, and whether other chemicals are present. HIGHLIGHTS: Exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons usually occurs by breathing air contaminated by wild fires or coal tar, or by eating foods that have been grilled. PAHs have been found in at least 600 of the 1,430 National Priorities List (NPL) sites identified by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). What are polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons? Most PAHs do not dissolve easily in water. They stick to solid particles and settle to the bottoms of lakes or rivers. Microorganisms can break down PAHs in soil or water after a period of weeks to months. In soils, PAHs are most likely to stick tightly to particles; certain PAHs move through soil to contaminate underground water. PAH contents of plants and animals may be much higher than PAH contents of soil or water in which they live. How might I be exposed to PAHs? Breathing air containing PAHs in the workplace of coking, coal-tar, and asphalt production plants; smokehouses; and municipal trash incineration facilities. Breathing air containing PAHs from cigarette smoke, wood smoke, vehicle exhausts, asphalt roads, or agricultural burn smoke. Coming in contact with air, water, or soil near hazardous waste sites. Eating grilled or charred meats; contaminated cereals, flour, bread, vegetables, fruits, meats; and processed or pickled foods. Drinking contaminated water or cow's milk. Nursing infants of mothers living near hazardous waste sites may be exposed to PAHs through their mother's milk. Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry Division of Toxicology and Human Health Sciences Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are a group of over 100 different chemicals that are formed during the incomplete burning of coal, oil and gas, garbage, or other organic substances like tobacco or charbroiled meat. PAHs are usually found as a mixture containing two or more of these compounds, such as soot. Some PAHs are manufactured. These pure PAHs usually exist as colorless, white, or pale yellow-green solids. PAHs are found in coal tar, crude oil, creosote, and roofing tar, but a few are used in medicines or to make dyes, plastics, and pesticides. What happens to PAHs when they enter the environment? PAHs enter the air mostly as releases from volcanoes, forest fires, burning coal, and automobile exhaust. PAHs can occur in air attached to dust particles. Some PAH particles can readily evaporate into the air from soil or surface waters. PAHs can break down by reacting with sunlight and other chemicals in the air, over a period of days to weeks. PAHs enter water through discharges from industrial and wastewater treatment plants. Page 2 of 2 September 1996 Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons CAS # 7440-38-2 How can PAHs affect my health? Mice that were fed high levels of one PAH during pregnancy had difficulty reproducing and so did their off spring. These offspring also had higher rates of birth defects and lower body weights. It is not known whether these effects occur in people. Animal studies have also shown that PAHs can cause harmful effects on the skin, body fluids, and ability to fight disease after both short- and long-term exposure. But these effects have not been seen in people. How likely are PAHs to cause cancer? The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) has determined that some PAHs may reasonably be expected to be carcinogens. Some people who have breathed or touched mixtures of PAHs and other chemicals for long periods of time have developed cancer. Some PAHs have caused cancer in labora tory animals when they breathed air containing them (lung cancer), ingested them in food (stomach cancer), or had them applied to their skin (skin cancer). Is there a medical test to show whether I've been exposed to PAHs? In the body, PAHs are changed into chemicals that can attach to substances within the body. There are special tests that can detect PAHs attached to these substances in body tissues or blood. However, these tests cannot tell whether any health effects will occur or find out the extent or source of your exposure to the PAHs. The tests aren't usually available in your doctor's office because special equipment is needed to conduct them.Has the federal government made recommendations to protect human health? The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set a limit of 0.2 milligrams of PAHs per cubic meter of air (0.2 mg/m 3). The OSHA Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) for mineral oil mist that contains PAHs is 5 mg/m 3 averaged over an 8-hour exposure period. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) recommends that the average workplace air levels for coal tar products not exceed 0.1 mg/m 3 for a 10-hour workday, within a 40-hour workweek. There are other limits for work place e xposure for things that contain PAHs, such as coal, coal tar, and mineral oil. Glossary Carcinogen: A substance that can cause cancer.

People often use the term \"pesticide\" to refer only to insecticides, but it actually applies to all the substances used to control pests. Well known pesticides include: insecticides, herbicides, rodenticides, and fungicides. Less well-known pesticides include: disinfectants, attractants, plant defoliants, swimming pool treatments, and plant growth regulators. The following list will help you understand the wide range of types of pesticides: Algicides kill algae in lakes, canals, swimming pools, water tanks, and other sites. Antifoulants kill or repel organisms that attach to underwater surfaces, such as barnacles that cling to boat bottoms.Antimicrobials kill microorganisms such as bacteria and viruses. Attractants lure pests to a trap or bait, for example, attract an insect or rodent into a trap. (However, food is not considered a pesticide when used as an attractant.) Biopesticides are derived from natural materials such as animals, plants, bacteria, and certain minerals.Biocides kill microorganisms. Defoliants cause leaves or foliage to drop from a plant, usually to facilitate harvest. Desiccants promote drying of living tissues, such as unwanted plant tops. Disinfectants and sanitizers kill or inactivate disease-producing microorganisms on inanimate objects. fungi (including blights, mildews, molds, and rusts). Fumigants produce gas or vapor intended to destroy pests, for example in buildings or soil.Herbicides kill weeds and other plants that grow where they are not wanted. Insect growth regulators disrupt the molting, maturing from pupal stage to adult, or other life processes of insects. Insecticides kill insects and other arthropods. Miticides (also called acaricides) kill mites that feed on plants and animals. Microbial pesticides are microorganisms that kill, inhibit, or out-compete pests, including insects or other microorganism pests. Molluscicides kill snails and slugs. Nematicides kill nematodes (microscopic, worm-like organisms that feed on plant roots). Ovicides kill eggs of insects and mites. Pheromones disrupt the mating behavior of insects. Plant growth regulators alter the expected growth, flowering, or reproduction rate of plants (does not include fertilizers). Plant Incorporated Protectants are substances that plants produce from genetic material that has been added to the plant. Repellents repel pests, including insects (such as mosquitoes) and birds. Rodenticides control mice and other rodents.

I:\\Tech \\HASP Appendices\\ Phase II \\More recent SDSs \\Heav y Metals Toxicity and the Environment.docx Heavy Metals Toxicity and the Environment Source: US National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health Abstract Heavy metals are naturally occurring elements that have a high atomic weight and a density at least 5 times greater than that of water. Their multiple industrial, domestic, agricultural, medical and technological applications have led to their wide distribution in the environment, raising concerns over their potential effects on human health and the environment. Their toxicity depends on several factors including the dose, route of exposure, and chemical species, as well as the age, gender, genetics, and nutritional status of exposed individuals. Because of their high degree of toxicity, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead, and mercury rank among the priority metals that are of public health significance. These metallic elements are considered systemic toxicants that are known to induce multiple organ damage, even at lower levels of exposure. They are also classified as human carcinogens (known or probable) according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and the International Agency for Research on Cancer. This review provides an analysis of their environmental occurrence, production and use, potential for human exposure, and molecular mechanisms of toxicity, genotoxicity, and carcinogenicity. Introduction Heavy metals are defined as metallic elements that have a relatively high density compared to water . With the assumption that heaviness and toxicity are inter-related, heavy metals also include metalloids, such as arsenic, that are able to induce toxicity at low level of exposure . In recent years, there has been an increasing ecological and global public health concern associated with environmental contamination by these metals. Also, human exposure has risen dramatically as a result of an exponential increase of their use in several industrial, agricultural, domestic and technological applications . Reported sources of heavy metals in the environment include geogenic, industrial, agricultural, pharmaceutical, domestic effluents, and atmospheric sources . Environmental pollution is very prominent in point source areas such as mining, foundries and smelters, and other metal-based industrial operations . Although heavy metals are naturally occurring elements that are found throughout the earth's crust, most environmental contamination and human exposure result from anthropogenic activities such as mining and smelting operations, industrial production and use, and domestic and agricultural use of metals and metal-containing compounds . Environmental contamination can also occur through metal corrosion, atmospheric deposition, soil erosion of metal ions and leaching of heavy metals, sediment re-suspension and metal evaporation from water resou rces to soil and ground water . Natural phenomena such as weathering and volcanic eruptions have also been reported to significantly contribute to heavy metal pollution. Industrial sources include metal processing in refineries, coal burning in power plants, petroleum combustion, nuclear power stations and high tension lines, plastics, textiles, microelectronics, wood preservation and paper processing plants . It has be en reported that metals such as cobalt (Co), copper (Cu), chromi um (Cr), iron (Fe), magnesium (Mg), manganese (Mn), molybdenum (Mo), nickel (Ni), selenium (Se) and zinc (Zn) are essential nutrients that are required for various biochemical and physiological functions . Inadequate supply of these micro-nutrients results in a variety of deficiency diseases or syndromes . Heavy metals are also considered as trace elements because of their presence in trace concentrations (ppb range to less than 10 ppm) in various environmental matrices. Their bioavailability is influenced by physical factors such as temperature, phase association, adsorption and sequestration. It is also affected by chemical factors that influence speciation at thermodynamic equilibrium, complexation kinetics, lipid solubility and octanol/water partition coefficients. Biological factors such as species characteristics, trophic interactions, and biochemical/physiological adaptation, also play an important role. I:\\Tech \\HASP Appendices\\ Phase II \\More recent SDSs \\Heav y Metals Toxicity and the Environment.docx The es sential heavy metals exert biochemical and physiological functions in plants and animals. They are important constituents of several key enzymes and play important roles in various oxidation-reduction reactions . Copper for example serves as an essential co-factor for several oxidative stress-related . Hence, it is an essential nutrient that is incorporated into a number of metalloenzymes involved in hemoglobin formation, carbohydrate metabolism, catecholamine biosynthesis, and cross-linking of collagen, elastin, and hair keratin. The ability of copper to cycle between an oxidized state, Cu(II), and reduced state, Cu(I), is used by cuproenzymes involved in redox reaction s. However, it is this property of copper that also makes it potentially toxic because the transitions between Cu(II) and Cu(I) can result in the generation of superoxide and hydroxyl radicals. Also, excessive exposure to copper has been linked to cellular damage leading to Wilson disease in humans . Similar to copper, several other essential elements are required for biologic functioning, however, an excess amount of such metals produces cellular and tissue damage leading to a varie ty of adverse effects and human diseases. For some including chromium and copper, there is a very narrow range of concentrations between beneficial and toxic effects. Other metals such as aluminium (Al), antinomy (Sb), arsenic (As), barium (Ba), beryllium (Be), bismuth (Cd), gallium (Ga), germanium (Ge), gold (Au), indium (In), lead (Pb), lithium (Li), mercury (Hg), nickel (Ni), platinum (Pt), silver (Ag), strontium (Sr), tellurium (Te), thallium (Tl), tin (Sn), titanium (Ti), vanadium (V) and uranium (U) have no established biological functions and are considered as non-essential metals. In b iological systems, heavy metals have been reported to affect cellular organelles and components such as cell membrane, mitochondrial, lysosome, endoplasmic reticulum, nuclei, and some enzymes involved in metabolism, detoxification, and damage repair . Metal ions have been found to interact with cell components such as DNA and nuclear proteins, causing DNA damage and conformational changes that may lead to cell cycle modulation, carcinogenesis or apoptosis . Several studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and oxidative stress play a key role in the toxicity and carcinogenicity of metals such as arsenic, cadmium , chromium , lead , and mercury . Because of their high degree of toxicity, these five elements rank among the priority metals that are of great public health significance. They are all systemic toxicants that are known to induce multiple organ damage, even at lower levels of exposure. According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA), and the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), these metals are also classified as either \"known\" or \"probable\" human carcinogens based on epidemiological and experimental studies showing an association between exposure and cancer incidence in humans and animals. Heavy metal-induced toxicity and carcinogenicity involves many mechanistic aspects, some of which are not clearly elucidated or understood. However, each metal is known to have unique features and physic-chemical properties that confer to its specific toxicological mechanisms of action. This review provides an analysis of the environmental occurrence, production and use, potential for human exposure, and molecular mechanisms of toxicity, genotoxicity, and carcinogenicity of arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead, and mercury. p. 1 1 3 2Health Fire Reactivity Personal Protection3 1 2 E Material Safety Data Sheet Arsenic MSDS Section 1: Chemical Product and Company assistance, Section 2: Composition and Information on Ingredients Composition: Name CAS # % by Weight Arsenic 7440-38-2 3: Hazards Identification Potential Acute Health Effects: Very hazardous in case of ingestion, of inhalation.

Also, excessive exposure to copper has been linked to cellular damage leading to Wilson disease in humans . Similar to copper, several other essential elements are required for biologic functioning, however, an excess amount of such metals produces cellular and tissue damage leading to a varie ty of adverse effects and human diseases. For some including chromium and copper, there is a very narrow range of concentrations between beneficial and toxic effects. Other metals such as aluminium (Al), antinomy (Sb), arsenic (As), barium (Ba), beryllium (Be), bismuth (Cd), gallium (Ga), germanium (Ge), gold (Au), indium (In), lead (Pb), lithium (Li), mercury (Hg), nickel (Ni), platinum (Pt), silver (Ag), strontium (Sr), tellurium (Te), thallium (Tl), tin (Sn), titanium (Ti), vanadium (V) and uranium (U) have no established biological functions and are considered as non-essential metals. In b iological systems, heavy metals have been reported to affect cellular organelles and components such as cell membrane, mitochondrial, lysosome, endoplasmic reticulum, nuclei, and some enzymes involved in metabolism, detoxification, and damage repair . Metal ions have been found to interact with cell components such as DNA and nuclear proteins, causing DNA damage and conformational changes that may lead to cell cycle modulation, carcinogenesis or apoptosis . Several studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and oxidative stress play a key role in the toxicity and carcinogenicity of metals such as arsenic, cadmium , chromium , lead , and mercury . Because of their high degree of toxicity, these five elements rank among the priority metals that are of great public health significance. They are all systemic toxicants that are known to induce multiple organ damage, even at lower levels of exposure. According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA), and the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), these metals are also classified as either \"known\" or \"probable\" human carcinogens based on epidemiological and experimental studies showing an association between exposure and cancer incidence in humans and animals. Heavy metal-induced toxicity and carcinogenicity involves many mechanistic aspects, some of which are not clearly elucidated or understood. However, each metal is known to have unique features and physic-chemical properties that confer to its specific toxicological mechanisms of action. This review provides an analysis of the environmental occurrence, production and use, potential for human exposure, and molecular mechanisms of toxicity, genotoxicity, and carcinogenicity of arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead, and mercury. p. 1 1 3 2Health Fire Reactivity Personal Protection3 1 2 E Material Safety Data Sheet Arsenic MSDS Section 1: Chemical Product and Company assistance, Section 2: Composition and Information on Ingredients Composition: Name CAS # % by Weight Arsenic 7440-38-2 3: Hazards Identification Potential Acute Health Effects: Very hazardous in case of ingestion, of inhalation.

It is a metal and has a high melting point. At ordinary temperatures, beryllium resists oxidation in air. Beryllium compounds are very toxic. Its ability to scratch glass is probably due to the formation of a thin layer of the oxide. Aquamarine and emerald are precious forms of the mineral beryl, [Be Al (SiO ) ]. Its chemistry is dominated by its tendency to lose an electron to form Be . As this ion is so small it is highly polarising, to the extent that its compounds are rather covalent. Its small size means that its complexes tend to be tetrahedral rahter than octahedral. Beryllium: historical information Beryllium by Nicholas Louis Vauquelin (1763-1829) in 1797 at France. Origin of name (../periodicity/discovery/): from the Greek word \"beryllos\" meaning \"beryl\". Emeralds and beryl were both known to early Egyptians but it was not realised until the end of the 18th century that they are the same mineral, now called beryllium aluminium silicate: [Be Al (SiO ) ]. The element was recognised by M.-L. Vauquelin in 1798 in beryl and emeralds. The metal was isolated much later on in 1828 by Friederich W\u00f6hler (and independently by A.-A.B. Bussy) by the action of potassium on BeCl in a platinum crucible. Find Flights to St Louis Get United's Best Fare to St Louis, MO.

In fact, compounds containing beryllium are poisonous. Beryllium is found in a number of minerals. The most important minerals are beryl, [Be Al (SiO ) ], which is often found as hexagonal prisms, and bertrandite [4BeO.2SiO .H O]. Aquamarine and emerald are precious forms of beryl.

The ground state electronic configuration of neutral Beryllium is (../periodicity/electronic_configuration/) [He].2s and the term (../periodicity/isolation/): beryllium metal is available commercially and so would never normally be made in the laboratory. Its extraction from ores is complex. The mineral beryl, [Be Al (SiO ) ] is the most important source of beryllium. It is roasted with sodimu hexafluorosilicate, Na SiF , at 700\u00b0C to form beryllium fluoride. This is water soluble and the beryllium may be precipitated as the hydroxide Be(OH) by adjustment of the pH to 12. Pure beryllium may be obtained by electrolysis of molten BeCl containing some NaCl. The salt is added since the molten BeCl conducts very poorly. Another method involves the reduction of beryllium fluoride with magnesium at 1300\u00b0C.

If the area is extensive, sweating can be impaired. Apply mild lotions and cleanse the affected area. Cool resting and sleeping areas to permit skin to dry between heat exposures. Heat Cramps Spasm, muscular pain (cramps) in stomach area and extremities (arms and legs). Provide replacement fluids with minerals (salt) such as Gatorade. Adequate salt intake with meals 1. ACCLIMATIZATION2 Heat Exhaustion Profuse sweating, cool (clammy) moist skin, dizziness, confusion, pale skin color, faint, rapid shallow breathing, headache, weakness, and/or muscle cramps. Remove from heat, sit or lie down, rest, replace lost water with electrolyte replacement fluids (water, Gatorade) take frequent sips of liquids in amounts greater than required to satisfy thirst. ACCLIMATIZATION 2 Adequate salt intake with meals1, only during early part of heat season. Ample water intake, frequently during the day. Heat Stro ke HOT Dry Skin. Sweating has stopped. Mental confusion, dizziness, nausea, chills, severe headache, collapse, delirium, and/or coma. HEAT STROKE IS A MEDICAL EMERGENCY Remove from heat. COOL THE BODY AS RAPIDLY AS POSSIBLE by immersing in cold (or cool) water, or splash with water and fan. Call for Emergency Assistance. Observe for signs of shock. ACCLIMATIZATION 2 Initially moderate workload in heat (8 to 14 days). Monitor worker's a ctivities. Footnotes : 1.) American diets are normally high in salt, sufficient to aid acclimatization. However, during the early part of the heat season, (May, June), one extra shake of salt during one to two meals per day may help, so long as this is pe rmitted by your physician. Check with your personal physician. 2.) ACCLIMATIZATION - The process of adapting to heat is indicated by worker's ability to perform hot jobs less fluid loss, lower concentrations of salt loss in sweat, and a reduced core (body) temperature and heart rate. 3.) Method to Achieve Acclimatization - Moderate work or exercise in hot temperatures during early part of heat season. Adequate salt (mineral) and water intake. Gradually increasing work time in hot temperatures. Avoid alcohol. Normally takes 8 to 14 days to achieve acclimatization. Lost rapidly, if removed from strenuous work (or exercise) in hot temperature for more than approximately 5 days.

SOP No. HS-001 Revision No. 4 Revised Date June 2016 1 of 13 SOP No. HS-001 STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES SOP No. HS-001 Biological Hazards 1.1 Objective The objective of this Standard Operating Pr ocedure (SOP) is to prevent or limit the potential for GEI personnel to encounter biological hazards during field activities. 1.2 General This SOP is intended for use by employees enga ged in work with the potential for contact with biological hazards such as animals, in sects, plants, and sewage. The site-specific health and safety plan (HASP) should incl ude a hazard assessment for the project that identifies the potential for encounters with biological hazards and the control methods to be implemented by GEI employees. These hazards must be reviewed in the project safety briefing and documented on the Project Safety Briefing form, found on th e Safety page of the GEI intranet. 1.3 Mammals During some site operations, animals such as stray or domesticated dogs or cats, raccoons, snakes, bears, rats, bats, etc. may be encountered. Employees should use discretion and attempt to avoid contact with animals. If these animals present a problem, efforts will be made to remove these animals from the site by contacting a licensed animal control technician. 1.3.1 Rabies The rabies virus is transmitted through the bite of an infected animal or contact with saliva or brain/nervous system tissue of an in fected animal. The rabi es virus infects the central nervous system, causing disease in th e brain. The early symp toms of rabies in people are fever, headache, and general w eakness or discomfort. As the disease progresses, more specific symptoms app ear and may include insomnia, anxiety, confusion, slight or partial paralysis, excitation, hallucina tions, agitation, hypersalivation (increase in saliva), difficu lty swallowing, and hydrophobia (fear of water). Death usually occurs within days of th e onset of these symptoms. If you are bitten or think you may be e xposed, wash any wounds immediately and thoroughly with soap and water. Then go to the hospital emergency room and notify the Project Manager and the People Safety Team. The doctor, possibly in consultation with the state or local health department, will decide if you need a rabies vaccination. Decisions to start series of vaccinations w ill be based on your type of exposure and the animal you were exposed to, as well as la boratory and surveillance information for the geographic area where the exposure occurred. If possible have someone document what type of animal it was, how it was behaving pr ior to the bite, what caused it to bite the GEI CONSULTANTS, INC. SOP No. HS-001 Revision No. 4 Revised Date June 2016 2 of 13 SOP No. HS-001 employee, and if it's not a domestic animal that would be easy to find again in the future, try to get animal control on site to captur e it. An Incident Report Form must be completed and submitted, per GEI's Incident reporting procedures. This form is available on the Safety App (smart phones) and on the Safety page on the GEI intranet. 1.4 Insects and Arachnids Insects, including bees, wasps, hornets, mosquito es, ticks, spiders, etc., may be present at a job site making the chance of a bite/sting possible. Some individuals may have a severe allergic reaction to an insect bite or sting that can result in a life-threatening condition. Some insect bites can transmit diseases such as Lyme disease or a virus such as West Nile. The following is a list of preventive measures: Apply insect repellent prior to performi ng field work and as often as needed throughout the work shift. Wear proper personal protective equipmen t (PPE), including protective clothing (work boots, socks, and light colored clothing). Wear shoes, long pants with bottoms tu cked into boots or socks, and a long- sleeved shirt when outdoors for long periods of time, or when many insects are most active (between dawn and dusk). When walking in wooded areas, avoid contac t with bushes, tall grass, or brush as much as possible. Field personnel who have or may have inse ct allergies must ha ve insect allergy medication onsite and must inform the Site Safety Officer (SSO) and the People and Safety Team of their particular allergy prior to commencing work. Field personnel should perform a self-ch eck at the end of the day for ticks. 1.4.1 Tick-borne Diseases Lyme Disease Lyme disease is caused by infection from a deer tick that carries a spirochete (a bacterium). During the painless tick bite, th e spirochete may be transmitted into the bloodstream, often after feeding on the host for 12 to 24 hours. The ticks that cause the disease are often no bigger than a poppy seed or a comma in newsprint. The peak months for human infection are from May to September. Symptoms appear in three stages. First symp toms usually appear from 2 days to a few weeks after a person is bitten by an infected tick. Symptoms usually consist of a ring-like red rash on the skin where the tick was attach ed. The rash is often bulls-eye like with red around the edges and clear in the center. The rash may be warm, itchy, tender, and/or \"doughy.\" This rash appears in only 60 to 80 pe rcent of infected persons. An infected GEI CONSULTANTS, INC. SOP No. HS-001 Revision No. 4 Revised Date June 2016 3 of 13 SOP No. HS-001 person also has flu-like sympto ms of a stiff neck, chills, fever, sore throat, headache, fatigue, and joint pain. These symptoms often disappear after a few weeks. The second stage symptoms, which occur w eeks to months later include meningitis, severe headache, drooping of the muscles on the face, called Bell's Palsy, encephalitis, numbness, withdrawal, and le thargy. These symptoms may last for several weeks to several months. Third stage symptoms, which occur months or years later include arthritis, heart problems, and loss of me mory. The third stage symptoms may mimic multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease. When in areas that could har bor deer ticks, employees shoul d wear light color clothing, and visually check themselves and check and be checked by another employee when coming from wooded or vegetated areas. If a GEI employee has a tick bite, the People and Safety Team and Project Manager must be contacted immediately. The employee will be offered the option for medical treatme nt by a physician, which typically involves antibiotics. An Incident Report form must be completed in compliance with the Incident Reporting procedures. This form is available on the Safety App (smart phones) and on the Safety page on the GEI intranet. If personnel feel sick or have signs simila r to those mentioned above, the SSO and the People and Safety Team must be notified immediately. Figure 1: From left to right, the deer tick adult female, adult male, nymph, and larva on a centimeter scale. How to Remove a Tick A tick can be removed from the skin by pulli ng gently at the head with tweezers. If tweezers are not available, use tissue paper or cloth to grasp the tick. It is important to grasp the tick as close to the site of attachment and use a firm steady pull to remove it. Wash hands immediately after with soap and water. The affected area should also be washed with soap and water, then disinfected with an antiseptic wipe, if available. All mouth parts must be removed from the ski n. If the tick was removed by breaking off the GEI CONSULTANTS, INC. SOP No. HS-001 Revision No. 4 Revised Date June 2016 4 of 13 SOP No. HS-001 mouth parts, an irritation or infection may occur because the organism that is causing the disease can still enter th e body through the skin. Treatment for Lyme Disease Treatment with antibiotics is effective and recovery is usually complete. For first stage symptoms, antibiotics are usually given orally. However, treatment for second and third stage symptoms is prolonged and recovery may take longer. Antibiotic treatment is usually provided intravenously for s econd and third stage Lyme disease. Babesiosis The deer tick can also cause Babesiosis, an infection of the parasite Babesia Microti. Symptoms of Baesiosis may not be evident, but may also include fever, fatigue and hemolytic anemia lasting from several days to several months. Babesiosis is most commonly diagnosed in the elderly or in individuals whose immune systems are compromised. If there are no signs or sympto ms of Babesiosis, usually no treatment it needed. If an employee believes they might ha ve Babesiosis they'll see a physician to be tested. Treatment usually consists of taki ng prescription medications for 7 to 10 days. Ehrlichiosis Ehrlichiosis is a tick-borne disease whic h can be caused by either of two different organisms. Human monocytic eh rlichiosis (HME) is caused by Ehrlichia chaffeensis , which is by the Amblyomma americanum ). caused by Anaplasma phagocytophilia , by the deer tick (Ixodes scapularis ). Ehrlichiosis is transmitted by the bite of infected ticks, including the deer tick and the lone star tick. The symptoms of HME and HGE are the same and usually include fever, muscle aches, weakness and headache. Patient s may also experience confusion, nausea, vomiting and joint pain. Unlike Lyme disease or Rocky Mountain spotted fever, a rash is not common. Infection usually produces mild to moderately severe illness, with high fever and headache, but may occasionally be life-threatening or even fatal. Symptoms appear 1 to 3 weeks after the b ite of an infected tick. Howe ver, not every exposure results in infection. For those that become infected a drug called Doxcycline will be prescribed. Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever Rocky Mountain spotted fever is a tick-borne disease caused by a rickettsia (a microbe that differs somewhat from bacteria and viru s). In the eastern United States, children are infected most frequently, while in the wester n United States, disease incidence is highest among adult males. Disease incidence is dire ctly related to expos ure to tick-infested habitats or to infested pets. Rocky Mountai n spotted fever is characterized by a sudden onset of moderate to high fever (which can last for 2-3 weeks), se vere headache, fatigue, deep muscle pain, chills and rash. The rash begins on the legs or arms, may include the GEI CONSULTANTS, INC. SOP No. HS-001 Revision No. 4 Revised Date June 2016 5 of 13 SOP No. HS-001 soles of the feet or palms of the hands and ma y spread rapidly to the trunk or rest of the body. Symptoms usually appear within 2 weeks of the bite of an infected tick. Like Ehrlichiosis the prescription drug Doxcyclin e is the first line treatment option. 1.4.2 Mosquito-Borne Disease West Nile Virus West Nile Virus is a mosquito-borne infecti on transmitted through the bite of an infected mosquito. The symptoms of West Nile Virus can be asymptomatic (no symptoms) or in more serious cases can lead to West Nile Fever. West Nile Fever can include fever, headache, tiredness, body ache, an occasional rash on the trunk of the body, and swollen lymph glands, In severe cases, people ha ve developed West Nile Encephalitis or Meningitis which symptoms include fever, head ache, neck stiffness, tremors, coma, and in some cases death. The incubation period for the disease is usually 2 to 15 days. The symptoms can range from a few days to several weeks. Most mosquitoes are not infected and the chance of infection from a mosquito bi te of an on-site employee is very small. 1.5 Repellants The following precautions will be used to help reduce the risk of mosquito bites: Reduce mosquito-breeding areas by making sure wheelbarrows, buckets, and other containers are turned upside down when not used so that they do not collect standing water. According to the Environmental Prot ection Agency (EPA), many mosquitoes can breed in pooled water that's minimal enough to fill a bottle cap. Wear shoes, long pants with bo ttoms tucked into boots or sock s, and a long-sleeved shirt when outdoors for long periods of time, or when many mosquitoes are most active (between dawn and dusk). Use mosquito repellant according to the ma nufacturer's directions when outdoors for long periods of time and when mosquitoes are most active. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) evaluation of information contained in peer-reviewed scientific literature and data available from the EPA has identified several EPA-registered products that provide repellent activ ity sufficient to help people avoid the bites of disease carrying mos quitoes. Products containing these active ingredients typically provide INC. SOP No. HS-001 Revision No. 4 Revised Date June 2016 6 of 13 SOP No. HS-001 Oil of Lemon Eucalyptus or PMD (Chemical Name: para-Menthane-3,8-diol) the synthesized version of oil of and can be used on clothing (but not skin) The EPA characterizes the active ingredie nts DEET and Picaridin as \"conventional repellents\" and Lemon Eucalyptus, PMD, and IR3535 as \"biopesticide repellents\", which are derived from natural materials. In general, higher concentrations of ac tive ingredient provide longer duration of protection, regardless of th e active ingredient, alt hough concentrations above approximately 50 percent do not offer a mark ed increase in protection time. Products with less than 10 percent active ingredient may offer only limited protection, often from 1 to 2 hours. Products that offer sustaine d release or contro lled release (micro- encapsulated) formulations, even with lowe r active ingredient concentrations, may provide longer protection times. Regardless of what product you use, if you start to get mosquito bites reapply the repellent according to the label instructions or remove yourself from the area with biting insects if possible. Clothing and other products can be purchased pre-treated, or produc ts can be treated using EPA-registered products. Permethrin is the only pesticide approved by the EPA for these uses. Permethrin binds tightly to the fa brics, resulting in little loss during washing and minimal transfer to the skin. Permethr in is poorly absorb ed through the skin, although sunscreens and other pr oducts may increase the rate of skin absorption. If you decide to use permethrin-treat ed clothing, consider these tips: Read the application instructions carefully and apply the product according to the label directions. Do not over-treat products. Permethrin treatments are only intended for use on fabrics; do not apply them directly to the skin or other items. Do not apply permethrin to clot hing while it is being worn. Apply the product to clothing outdoors in we ll ventilated areas that are protected from wind. Hang treated fabrics outdoors and allow them to dry completely before wearing them. Wash permethrin treated clothing se parately from other clothing items. GEI CONSULTANTS, INC. SOP No. HS-001 Revision No. 4 Revised Date June 2016 7 of 13 SOP No. HS-001 1.6 Poisonous Plants The potential for contact with poisonous plants, such as poison ivy, oak, and sumac exists when performing fieldwork in wooded or boggy areas. Urushiol, an oily organic allergen found in plants, can cause an alle rgic reaction when in contact with the le aves or vines. Poison ivy can be found as vines on tree trunks or as upright bushes. Poison ivy consists of three leaflets with notched edges. Two leaflets form a pair on opposite sides of the stalk, and the third leaflet stands by itself at the tip. Poison ivy is red in the early spring and turns shiny green later in the spring. Poison ivy grows throughout much of North America, including all states east of the Rocky Mountains. It is normally found in wooded areas, especially along edge areas where the tree line breaks and allows sunshine to filter through. It also grows in exposed ro cky areas, open fields, and disturbed areas. Poison oak can be present as a sparsely-bra nched shrub. Poison oak can grow anywhere in the United States with the exception of Ha waii, Alaska, and some southwest areas that have desert climates. Poison oak is similar to poison ivy in that it has the same leaflet configuration; however, the leaves have sligh tly deeper notches. Poison sumac can be present in the form of a flat-topped shrub or tr ee. It has fern-like leaves, which are velvety dark green on top and pale underneath. The branches of immature trees have a velvety \"down.\" Pois on sumac has white, \"hairy\" berry clusters. Poison sumac grows exclusively in very wet or flooded soils, usually in swamps and peat bogs, in the eastern United States. Poison Oak Poison Ivy Poison Sumac Poison Sumac GEI CONSULTANTS, INC. SOP No. HS-001 Revision No. 4 Revised Date June 2016 8 of 13 SOP No. HS-001 To prevent exposure to these poisonous plants: Wear proper PPE, including long sleeves, long pants, boots, and gloves. Barrier skin creams, such as lotion containing bentoquatum (Tecnu\u00ae), may offer some protection prevent the o ccurrence of exposure symptoms. Contact with poison ivy, sumac, or oak ma y lead to a skin rash, characterized by reddened, itchy, blistering skin which n eeds first aid treatment. Employees with known allergies should identify themselves to the SSO or Project Manager prior to starting field work as a precautionary measure. If you believe you have contacted one of these plants: o Immediately wash skin thoroughly with soap and water, taking care not to touch your face or other body parts. o Contact the People and Safety Team and Project Manager immediately after caring for affected skin.

SOP No. HS-001 Revision No. 4 Revised Date June 2016 9 of 13 SOP No. HS-001 o Wash exposed clothing separately in hot water with detergent. After use, clean tools, and soles of boots w ith rubbing alcohol or soap and lots of water. Urushiol can remain active on the surface of objects for up to 5 years. If a rash occurs, contact the People and Safety Team and complete and submit an Incident Report Form. This form is avai lable on the Safety App (smart phones) and on the Safety page on the GEI intranet. 1.7 Sewage and Bacterial Impacted Sediments Some project work may be conducted at sites that serve or have served as a combined sewer overflow and consequently may have re ceived untreated sanitary sewage from numerous sources. Decomposed sewage can pot entially be encountered within sites and their sediments. Sediments could contain so il and marine microorganisms, and bacterium associated with sewage. Many of these bact erium can cause illne ss through ingestion, direct contact, or the inhala tion of a bio-aerosol possibly in the form of dust. Potential respiratory exposure to biological agents can also occur through the inhalation of aerosols produced during sediment handli ng activities. PPE as identified in the site-specific HASP will be worn to minimize potential exposures. Employees will follow the decontamination or disposal procedures identified in the HASP. 1.7.1 Fungal Spores in Soil - Valley Fever Valley Fever is an illness that usually a ffects the lungs. It is caused by the fungus Coccidioides immitis that lives in the top 2 to 12 in ches of soil in many parts of California. When fungal spores are present, a ny work activity that disturbs the soil, such as digging, grading, or other ea rth moving operations, or vehicl e operation on dirt roads, can cause the spores to become airborne, th erefore increasing the risk of Valley Fever. All employees on sites where the fungus is present, and who are exposed to dusty conditions and wind-blown dusts are at increased risk of becoming infected. Valley Fever fungal spores are too small to be seen, and there is no reliable way to test the soil for spores before working in a particular place. Valley Fever can be found throughout the southwestern Unit ed States, parts of Mexic o, and South America. Some California counties cons istently have Valley Fever fungus present in the soil. In these regions Valley Fever is considered endemic. Health departments track the number of cases of Valley Fever illness that occur. This information is used to map illness rates as seen on the figures below from the Center of Disease Control Valley Fever Awareness website. GEI CONSULTANTS, INC. SOP No. HS-001 Revision No. 4 Revised Date June 2016 10 of 13 SOP No. HS-001 GEI CONSULTANTS, INC. SOP No. HS-001 Revision No. 4 Revised Date June 2016 11 of 13 SOP No. HS-001 When present, symptoms usually occur between 7 to 21 days after breathing in spores, and can include: Cough Fever Chest pain Headache Muscle aches Rash on upper trunk or extremities Joint pain in the knees or ankles Fatigue Symptoms of Valley Fever can be mistaken for other diseases such as the flu (influenza) and TB (tuberculosis), so it is important for employees to obtain medical care for an accurate diagnosis and possible treatment. While there is no vaccine to prevent Valley Fe ver, the following important steps must be taken in order to limit risk: Determine if the worksite is in an endemic area. Contact the local health department for more information about th e risk in the county GEI is performing work that may disturb soils. Prepare work plans and work practices that reduce employee's exposure, which may include: o Provide air conditioned cabs with properly maintained dust filters for vehicles that generate heavy dust an d make sure employees keep windows and vents closed. o Suspend work during heavy winds. When exposure to dust is unavoidable, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)-approved respiratory pr otection with partic ulate filters rated as N95, N99, N100, P100, or High Efficien cy Particulate Air (HEPA) must be provided. The Project Manager must work with the Safety Team to develop and implement a respiratory protection pr ogram in accordance with California's Occupational Safety and Health Admi nistration (Cal/OSHA's) Respiratory Protection standard (8 CCR 5144) for the project. Take measures to reduce transpor ting spores offsite, such as: o Clean tools, equipment, PPE, and vehi cles before transporting offsite. o If employee's clothing is likely to be heavily contaminated with dust, provide coveralls and change room s, and showers where possible.

SOP No. HS-002 Revision No. 6 Revised Date: October 2018 1 of 4 SOP No. HS-002 STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES SOP No. HS-002 Infectious Materials and Bloodborne Pathogens Exposure Control Plan 1.1 Objective GEI personnel may come in contact with poten tially infectious agents (materials) when performing first aid or cardiopulmonary resuscit ation (CPR). Employees may also come into contact with these agents when working at certain contaminated sites (i.e., urban sites, discarded contaminated needles, or sewer outfall exposures ). This standard operating procedure (SOP) has been developed to minimize the potential for ex posure to employees who may contact, directly or indirectly, inf ectious agents. 1.2 General This SOP is intended for use by employees engaged in work with the potential for contact with infectious materials and bloodborne pathogens. The site-specific he alth and safety plan (HASP) should include a hazard assessment for the proj ect that identifies the potential for encounters with infectious materials or bloodborne pathogens and the control methods to be implemented by GEI employees. Exposure determinations are made by listing job functions impacted by potential exposure. The HASP will list job classifications or tasks in wh ich occupational exposure could occur such as employees collecting samples or expected to provide First Aid. These hazards should be reviewed in the project safety brie fing and documented on the Project Safety Briefing form, found on the Safety page of the GEI intranet. Engineering and work practice controls shall be used to eliminate or minimize employee exposure. Exposure determinations are made without regard to the use of personal protective equipment. When differentiation between body fl uid types is difficult or impossible, all body fluids shall be considered pot entially infectious materials. Universal Precautions (i.e., treat all potentially infectious material s as if it were infected) will be used by GEI employees. 1.3 Exposure Control Plan 1.3.1 Standard Procedures A written Exposure Control Plan applicable to potential occupational exposure to blood or other potentially infectious materials will be develope d as necessary based on project hazards. This plan will be accessible to each affected employee. Sampling of materials containing potentially infectious materials will be performed in a manner that minimizes the potential for creating splashes , droplets, or aerosols. Mechanical pipetting devices will be used for manipulating sanitary sewer effluent. Mouth pi petting is prohibited. GEI CONSULTANTS, INC. SOP No. HS-002 Revision No. 6 Revised Date: October 2018 2 of 4 SOP No. HS-002 The use of glassware or equipment with sharp or pointed edges will be kept at a minimum to reduce the potential of inju ry that would create a direct route of entry into the body for infectious materials. Minor cuts, scratches, or other br eaks in the skin barrier will be covered prior to the handling of infectious materials. Employees experienci ng exudative lesions or weeping dermatitis will refrain from direct contact w ith infectious materials. Eating, drinking, smoking, or application of cosmetics is not permitted in areas where potentially infectious materials are handled or sampled. Employees will wash and disinfect their hands, f ace, or other potentially contaminated skin surfaces upon completing the handling of infectious or potentially infectious agents or after rendering first aid. Hand washing facilities are readily available at all work locations. When provision of hand washing facilities is not feasible, either an appropriate antiseptic hand cleanser used in conjunction with clean cloth/paper towels or antiseptic towelettes will be provided. All equipment and environmental and working surf aces will be cleaned and decontaminated after contact with blood or other pot entially infectious materials. Specimens of blood or other potentially infectious materials (i.e. bandages) will be placed in a container which prevents leakage during collection, ha ndling, processing, storage, transport, or shipping. 1.3.2 Personal Protective Equipment When there is a potential for occupational exposur e GEI will provide, at no cost to the employee, appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). PPE will be worn to reduce the potential of exposures to splashes or aerosols. At a minimum, PPE will include safety glasses and appropriate gloves, but may also require the use of face, respiratory, foot, and full-body protection. Refer to the site-specific HASP for specific PPE requirements. Disposable PPE used in the handling or sampling of infectious materials will be appropriately disposed of and not reused. 1.3.3 Medical Monitoring Medical monitoring is required for an empl oyee when a potential workplace exposure has occurred. GEI will make available the hepatitis B vaccine and vaccin ation series to all employees who have occupational exposure, and post-exposur e evaluation and follow-up to all employees who have had an exposure incident. These are ma de available at no cost to the employee. The employee must follow the GEI Incident Reporting procedures regarding th e potential exposure as soon as possible. For infectious agents in wh ich a medically accepted vaccination has been developed (e.g., hepatitis B virus) (HBV) potentia lly exposed employees will be given the option to receive an inoculation at no cost. Employees who have been exposed will be given the option to receive a confidential medi cal evaluation also at no cost. Required records for exposed GEI CONSULTANTS, INC. SOP No. HS-002 Revision No. 6 Revised Date: October 2018 3 of 4 SOP No. HS-002 employees will be kept confidential. GEI will keep these medical records for at least the duration of employment plus 30 years and will be mainta ined for 3 years from the date on which the training occurred. All records required to be ma intained shall be made available and GEI will comply with the requirements involving transf er of records set forth in 29 CFR 1910.1020(h). 1.3.4 Training Training will be conducted at the time of initial assignment to tasks where exposure may take place and at least annually thereaft er. All training for employees shall be provided within one year of their previous training. Employees with a reasonable risk for exposure must complete Bloodborne Pathogen training cove ring the following topics: An explanation of the Occupational Hea lth and Safety Administration (OSHA) bloodborne pathogen standard. A general explanation of bloodborne diseases. An explanation of the modes of transmission of bloodborne diseases. Communications of hazards to employees. An explanation of the GEI's Bloodborne Pathogen SOP and exposure control plan. Appropriate methods for recognizing task s that involve pot ential exposure.

SOP No. HS-004 Revision No. 5 Revised Date : December 2017 1 of 8 SOP No. HS -004 STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE HS-004 Driver Safety 1.1 Objective GEI has implemented a Sa fe Driving Program to encourage safe driving habits and promote the ongoing safety of our staff and the communities where we work . For more information, refer to the Operation of Vehicles section of GEI 's Employee Handbook. This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) provides requirements and recommendations to minimize the potential risks while operating or riding in a motor vehicle. 1.2 General GEI employees will adhere to the following requirements when operating a vehicle while conducting business on behalf of GEI . These requirements apply to GEI -owned, rental, and personal vehicles used to conduct GEI business : Employees must maintain a v alid and current driver 's license . Employees using a personal vehicle for work -related travel must have proper insurance coverage t hat meets the requirements in the state in which they reside. Employees must wear their safety belt while in a moving vehicle . Vehicle incidents will be reported in accordance with GEI 's Incident Reporting procedures (refer to GEI's Safety App for smart phones or the Safety page on the GEI intranet. ). Vehicles will be properly maintained and safely operated (refer to GEI's Fleet Maintenance Program). Employees will follow safe driving behaviors , which includ e limiting distractions such as manipulati ng radios or other equipment that may cause a distraction . Employees should not exceed the posted speed limit and should maintain a safe distance between other vehicles . When parkin g a vehicle at a job site , the employee should position the vehicle in a manner which reduce s or eliminate s the need to operate the vehicle in reverse . It is recommended, a safety cone should be placed at the rear of the vehicle after parking the vehicle and be removed prior to moving the vehicle. This precautionary measure makes the employee aware of other vehicles, equipment, and structures within the backup radius of the vehicle. When driving a n unfamiliar vehicle ( rental or GEI -owned ), it is the driver 's responsibility to orient them selves to the vehicle by: GEI CONSULTANTS, INC. SOP No. HS-004 Revision No. 5 Revised Date : December 2017 2 of 8 SOP No. HS -004 Walk ing around the vehicle to observe the condition of the vehicle and hazards that could be within the travel path . Becoming familiar with the size of the vehicle . Note if the vehicle has anti-lock braking system ( ABS1). Adjust ing mirrors (rear and side) . Adjust seats to be situated as far back as safely p ractical , away from the air bag, located in the steering wheel. Becom ing familiar with dashboard , center console, and steering controls . Locat ing the turn signals, windshield wipers, lights, emergency flashers, and the heating, air conditioning, and defrost controls . 1.3 Driving Defensively Driving defensively means not only taking responsibility for oneself and actions but also keeping an eye on \"the other guy. \" Good defensive drivers may be able to anticipate what the other driver will do next. GEI recommends the following guidelines to help reduce risks while driving : Do not start the vehicle until each passenger and any belongings are secured in the vehicle. Remember that driving above or below the speed limit can increase the likelihood of a collision. Be aware of impaired drivers; i f a car is straddling the center line, weaving, making wide turns, stopping abruptly , or responding slowly to traffic signals, the driver may be impaired or using a cellular telepho ne. Avoid an impaired driver by turning right at the nearest corner or exiting at the nearest exit. o If it appears that an oncoming car is crossing into your lane, pull over to the roadside, sound the horn , and flash the head lights. o If an unsafe or suspici ous driver is observed, n otify the police. Follow the rules of the road. Do not contest the \"right of way \" or try to race another car during a merge. Always b e respectful of other motorists. 1 ABS is a mechanism that allows the wheels on a vehicle to maintain contact with the surface of the road, based on inputs from the driver (braking ), to prevent the wheels from locking up (ceasing rotation) and to avoid an uncontrolled skid. GEI CONSULTANTS, INC. SOP No. HS-004 Revision No. 5 Revised Date : December 2017 3 of 8 SOP No. HS -004 Allow large vehicles, including tractor trailers, extra breaking distance, turning radius, and avoid traveling in the other driver's blind spots. Do not follow too closely. GEI employees should u se a minimum of \"3-second following distance .\" While driving , be cautious, aware , and responsible. Use extra caution , observe road signs, and reduce speed in construction areas and school zones . Always be aware of p edestrian s, bicycl ists, and motorcyclists. 1.4 Cellular Phone Use and Other Distractions Refer to the Portable Communication Device Use While Driving section of the GEI Employee Handbook for GEI's policy on the use of cellular telephones while operating a vehicle. 1.5 Drugs and Alcohol The use of illegal drugs or alcohol is prohibited when driving a vehicle on GEI business . Be aware of the side effects of prescription and over -the-counter medications which can impair an employee 's ability to drive. 1.6 Adverse Driving Conditions When operating a vehicle, its possible adverse driving conditions may be encountered. Below is a list of possible conditions and how they can be mitigated. 1.6.1 Driving at Night Vision maybe limited at night due to impairment of the driver 's depth perception, color recognition, and peripheral vision . Another factor adding danger to night or early morning driving is fatigue. Drowsiness makes driving more difficult by dulling concentration and slowing reaction time. Effective measures to minimize these hazards by preparing the car and following guidelines : Check the headlights to ensure they are properly ai med. If you notice the headlights are not properly aimed, report it to the Branch Manager, or if applicable the rental car agent. Misaimed headlights blind other drivers and reduce the driver's ability to see the road. In addition to the known hazards of c onsuming a lcohol prior to driving, night driving can potentially be affected because the recovery rate of glare from headlights is prolonged. Thus reducing your ability to see. GEI CONSULTANTS, INC. SOP No. HS-004 Revision No. 5 Revised Date : December 2017 4 of 8 SOP No. HS -004 Smoking in GEI vehicles and rentals is not permitted. When driving a personal vehicle for business, a void smoking wh ile driving. Nicotine and carbon monoxide may hamper night vision. Observe driving safety as soon as the sun goes down. Twilight is one of the most difficult times to drive, because the eyes ' pupils are constantly cha nging to adapt to the growing darkness Always use headlights at dusk and at dawn; l ights will not help the driver see better in early twilight, but they will make it easier for other drivers to see you r car. Drive at a speed that allows you to see the road that is within the headlights span. Driving in a manner that prevents you from seeing hazards as they are illuminated is known as overdriving the headlights ; it may be necessary for the driver to reduce spe ed to be prepared to brake within the illuminated area of the headlights . If an oncoming vehicle does not lower beams from high to low, avoid glare by watching the right edge of the road and using it as a steering guide. The driver should m ake frequent sto ps for light snacks and exercise. If the driver is too tired to drive, stop in a safe area and get some rest . 1.6.2 Snow/Freezing Conditions When snow and ice are present , be prepared by following these winter driving safety tips. 1.6.2.1 Prepare the Vehicle Before a Sn owstorm Check under the hood and take a look at the vehicles cooling system. Make sure the vehicle contains adequate antifreeze and t he hoses are in good condition. Test heaters and defrosters ahead of time to make sure they are in good working cond ition. Test the windshield wipers and check the condition of the wiper blades. If wipers leave streaks on the windshields, replace the blades at the next possible opportunity. Keep the receipt to expense the cost with GEI or with the car rental company . It is recommended that a windshield washer/antifreeze solution is used during winter conditions . Check the lights on the vehicle and periodical ly clear them of snow and dirt. Vehicle batteries need extra power in cold conditions. Make sure the battery 's terminals a re clean and cables are secure. Determine if the vehicle has a anti -lock brake (ABS) system. Keep the gas tank at least half -full in the winter to help avoid gas line freeze up. GEI CONSULTANTS, INC. SOP No. HS-004 Revision No. 5 Revised Date : December 2017 5 of 8 SOP No. HS -004 1.6.2.2 Driving During and After a Snowstorm Wear sunglasses to aid in limiting reflection from snow. Be aware of bli nd spots created by snow banks. Be extra cautious of pedestrians and o ther vehicles in intersections. Allow extra time for braking and increase the distance between you r car and the car immediately in front of the car. Reduce speed and do not exceed the posted limit. If the tires starts to lose traction , remove the foot off the gas and gradually reduce speed. Accelerate slowly once traction is regained. If the vehicle starts to skid, and does not have anti -lock brakes, steer into the skid. This will bring the back end of the car in line with the front. Avoid using the brakes. If the vehicle does have anti -lock brakes, firmly brake as you steer into the skid. 1.6.3 Driving In the Rain To prevent l osing control of the car on wet pavement , take these preventive measures. Prevent skids by driving slowly and c arefully, especially on curves. Steer and brake with a light touch. When necessary to stop or slow, do not brake hard or lock the wheels. Maintain mild pressure on the brake pedal. Skidding If the car begins to skid, ease the foot off the gas, and carefully steer the car in the direction you want the front of the car to go. For cars without anti -lock brakes, avoid using the brakes. This procedure, known as \"steering into the skid ,\" will bring the back end of the car in line with the front. If the car has anti-lock brake sy stems ( ABS ), brake firmly as you steer into the skid. Hydroplaning Hydroplaning happens when the water in front of the tires builds up faster than the car's weight can push it out of the way. The water pressure causes the car to lose contact with the road surface and slide on a thin layer of water between the tires and the road. At this point, the car can be completely out of contact with the road, making it possible for the driver to skid or drift out of the lane, or even off the road. GEI CONSULTANTS, INC. SOP No. HS-004 Revision No. 5 Revised Date : December 2017 6 of 8 SOP No. HS -004 To avoid hydroplaning, keep the tires properly inflated and maintain good tread on the tires. If tires need to be replaced on a company vehicle , notify the branch manager or their designee . Slow down when roads are wet, and stay away from puddles. Try to d rive in the tire tracks left by the cars in front of the vehicle . If the car begin s to hydroplan e, do not brake or turn suddenly. This could throw the car into a skid. Ease the foot off the gas until the car slows ; accelerate slowly once traction is regained . If braking is needed , do so gently with light pumping actions. If the car has ABS , brake normally; the car 's computer will mimic a pumping action, as necessary. If weather conditions worsen to the point where the driver is not comfortable driving , pull the vehicle over to a safe location until conditions improve . Do not drive during severe weather conditions . Do not attempt to drive on roads with standing water or that have been flooded . Find an alternate route if these conditions exist. 1.6.4 Off Road If operation of a vehicle is required off public or private roads or in situations where four - wheel -drive vehicles are required, the appropriate vehicle for the situation will be used. Be sure any gear or equipment is secured inside the vehicle so it doesn 't bounce around while the vehicle is off-road. Know the underside of the vehicle. Look under the vehicle and learn where the lowest -hanging parts are located so they are not damag ed. Scout tricky terrain on foot. Don't hesitate to get out of the vehicle to examine, up close, the terrain and soil conditions. And be sure to scout out what 's on the other side of a hill ahead of time so there are no surprises. Drive cautiously. Drive , \"as slow as possible, as fast as n ecessary. \" Remember to use the gears to efficiently manage engine power, braking , and torque. Create a mental picture. Look ahead and visualize the paths to the vehicle will travel. Follow those paths. Drive straight up and down hills. Avoid diagonal lines that put the vehicle in a situation where it might roll. 1.7 Driver Training GEI employees are required to complete driver safety training every 3 years . This training is managed by the People Team and will be assigned through GEI's e -learning provider . GEI CONSULTANTS, INC. SOP No. HS-004 Revision No. 5 Revised Date : December 2017 7 of 8 SOP No. HS -004 1.8 Injury Reporting GEI employees will report incidents involving GEI personnel or subcontractor personnel, such as: lost time injuries, injuries requiring medical attention, near miss incidents, fires, fatalities, accidents involving the public, chemical spills , vehicle accidents, and property damage. The following steps must be followed when an incident occurs: 1. In life -threatening situations, immediately call 9 -1-1. 2. Stop work activit y to address any injury, illness, property damage , spill or other emergency. 3. Immediately report any incidents to your Supervisor/Project Manager and Regional Health & Safety Officer. 4. If your injury or illness is not life -threatening, call Medcor Triage at 1 -800-775- 5866 to speak with a medical professional. 5. Complete an Incident Report Form immediately after addressing the incident. Report form s are available on GEI's Safety App ( for smart phones) and on the Safety page on the GEI intranet. For vehicle accidents involving another vehicle or damage to property, the employee will take pictures of each vehi cle or property involved in the incident and obtain a police report. In some municipalities police will not be dispatched to a non -injury accident, but every effort needs to be made to try and obtain the report. 1.8.1 Injury Triage Service If a GEI employee experiences a work -related injury that is not life -threatening, the employee will initiate a call to Medcor Triage at 1 -800-775-5866. The injured employee will detail any medical symptoms or complaints which will be evaluated by a Registered Nurse (RN) specially trained to perform telephonic triage. The RN will recommend first aid self -treatment or refer the injured employee for an off -site medical evaluation by a health professional at a clinic within GEI's workers compensation provider network. GEI employees are still required to follow our Accident Reporting procedures as listed above. 1.9 Limitations Follow safety procedures as def ined in the site -specific HASP. 1.10 References National Safety Council Oklahoma Safety Council GEI Consultants, Inc.

SOP No. HS-006 Revision No. 5 Revised Date: September 2016 1 of 5 SOP No. HS-006 STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES SOP No. HS-006 Excavations and Trenches 1.1 Objective The objective of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to highlight the hazards and safety procedures when work activities include excavations and/or trenches. The following guidelines will be followed when excavations or trenches are present on GEI projects. 1.2 General This SOP is intended for use by employees enga ged in work on project sites that include trenching and/or excavation operations. The site-specific health and safety plan (HASP) must include a hazard assessment for the projec t that identifies the potential for trenching and excavation hazards and the control methods to be implemented by GEI employees. These hazards must be reviewed in the pr oject safety briefing and documented on the Project Safety Briefing form, found on the Safety page of the GEI intranet. An \"excavation\" is any man-made cut, cavity, trench, or depression in an earth surface formed by earth removal. A \"trench\" (trench excavation) is a narrow excavation (in re lation to its length) made below the surface of the ground. In general, th e depth is greater than the width, but the width of a trench (measured at the bottom) is not greater than 15 feet. Do not enter a trench or excavation wit hout consulting with the Project Manager, Corporate Health and Safety Officer (CHSO), or Regional Health and Safety Officer (RHSO). 1.2.1 Personal Protective Equipment Employees will be provided with the persona l protective equipment (PPE) necessary to help protect them from the hazards of work activities related to excavations and/or trenches. All employees will wear a hard hat, steel toe or composite toe boots, and safety glasses at a minimum. In addition, face sh ields, gloves, fall protection and hearing protection may be required. PPE must be maintained in good condition, kept clean and properly stored when not in use. More inform ation regarding PPE is located in Section 6 of GEI's Corporate Health and Safety Program. GEI CONSULTANTS, INC. SOP No. HS-006 Revision No. 5 Revised Date: September 2016 2 of 5 SOP No. HS-006 1.3 Hazards Hazards associated with excavations and tr enches can include collapse, falls, falling objects, hazardous atmospheres, and incidents involving mobile equipment. One cubic yard of soil can weigh as much as a car. 1.4 Entry GEI employees will not enter trenches or excavations that do not comply with OSHA 29 CFR 1926.650. If a project requires GEI employees to enter a trench or excavation, the trench or excavation must meet the follo wing requirements described in the following sections. Do not enter a trench or excavation wit hout consulting with the Project Manager, Corporate Health and Safety Officer (CHSO), or Regional Health and Safety Officer (RHSO). 1.4.1 Competent Person The excavation must be inspected prior to th e start of each shift by a competent person who most likely will work for the contactor performing the work. The competent person is an individual who is capable of identifyi ng existing and predictable hazards or working conditions that are hazardous, unsanitary, or dangerous to workers, soil types and protective systems required, and who is authoriz ed to take prompt corrective measures to eliminate these hazards and conditions. GE I generally does not act as the competent person. 1.4.2 Soil Type The competent person for the project will determ ine what the soil type is and what type of protective system will be implemented. The type of soil where the excavation or trench is being dug has significant influence on what ty pe of protective system will need to be in place. There are four types of soil: stable rock, type A, type B, and type C. As you progress from stable rock to type C, the c ohesive properties of th e soil change the soil becomes less stable. 1.4.3 Protective System A protective system is required for trenches or excavations greater th an 5 feet in depth unless the excavation is made entirely in stable rock. In special situations the competent person may require a protection system for an excavation that is less than 5 feet deep. The competent person is responsible for assessi ng the soil type and the protective systems required for a specific trench when an excav ation is less than 20 feet deep. If the excavation is greater than 20 feet in dept h, the protection system requires a design by a registered professional engineer or based on tabulated data prepared and/or approved by a registered professional engineer. GEI CONSULTANTS, INC. SOP No. HS-006 Revision No. 5 Revised Date: September 2016 3 of 5 SOP No. HS-006 The protective system will be designed ba sed on soil type, depth of excavation, water level, loads adjacent to the excavation, change s in weather conditions, or other operations in the area. Protective systems can include sloping or benching of the sidewalls, shoring the sidewalls using an approved support system , or shielding workers with a trench box or other similar type of support. The different types of protective systems include: Benching is a method of protecting workers from cave-ins by excavating the sides of an excavation to form one or a series of horizontal levels of steps, usua lly with vertical or near vertical surfaces between levels. Be nching cannot be done with Type C soil. Sloping involves cutting back the trench wall at an angle inclined away from the excavation. Shoring requires installing aluminum hydraulic or other types of s upport structures to prevent soil movement and cave-ins. Shielding protects workers by using trench boxes or other types of s upports to prevent soil cave-ins. Designing a protective system can be complex because many factors must be considered: soil classification, depth of cu t, water content of soil, changes caused by weather or climate, surcharge loads (e.g., s poil, other materials to be used in the trench) and other operations in the vicinity. 1.4.4 Access and Egress Excavations and trenches greater than 4 f eet in depth require a safe access and egress including ladders, steps, or ramps. These poi nts of access and egress are to be no greater than 25 feet of lateral tr avel in any direction. 1.4.5 Atmospheric Hazards Where oxygen deficiency (atmospheres c ontaining less than 20.7% oxygen) or a hazardous atmosphere exists or could reasona bly be expected to exist, such as in excavations in landfill areas or excavations in areas wher e hazardous substances are stored nearby, the atmospheres in the excavat ion will be tested before employees enter excavation. 1.5 Subcontractor Oversight When GEI is overseeing excavation activ ities performed by a subcontractor, the following safety hazards should be monitored: GEI CONSULTANTS, INC. SOP No. HS-006 Revision No. 5 Revised Date: September 2016 4 of 5 SOP No. HS-006 Care must be taken not to create new hazards like narrow walkways along edges of an excavation. Heavy equipment must not be parked or working at the edge of the excavation. Spoils should not be stockpiled with in 2 feet of the trench edges. Confirm with subcontractor that undergr ound utilities have been located before any excavation or trench ing activities begin (refer to SOP HS-014 Utility Mark- out). Confirm with the subcontractor that the ex cavation or trench has been tested for hazardous atmospheres before entering. Confirm with the subcontractor that the excavation or trench has been inspected by a competent person before each work shift and after any type of precipitation. If hazards are identified during this inspection, verify that the hazards are controlled prior to entering the trench or excavation. GEI employees will not work unde r raised or suspended loads. Excavations/trenches must be protected at th e end of a work shift if they are to be left open. These trenches/excavations mu st be covered and a sign that reads \"Hole\" must be placed in a location that will notify anyone of the hazard. Or a secure barricade will ne ed to be installed. In circumstances where GEI employees ar e working on sites where a contractual agreement with the excavation contractor doe s not exist and we cannot confirm the above stated conditions, entry into trenches or ex cavations will not be conducted. Any safety concerns that arise should be communicated to the Project Manager and, if necessary, the client. 1.6 Injury Reporting If a GEI employee suffers an injury on the job that is not life threating, call Medcor Triage at 1-800-775-5866 to speak with a me dical professional. Then, immediately report the injury to the Supervisor/Project Manager and Regional Safety Officer. After verbal notification has been made, an Incident Report Form is to be completed by the employee and/or Supervisor/Project Manager and submitted to the People & Safety Team immediately following care of the incident. This form is available on the Safety App (smart phones) and on the Safe ty page on the GEI intranet. Upon notification from a Branch or Offi ce Manager, Human Resources, and/or the receipt of the Incident Report Form, the Regional Health & Safety Officer (RHSO) will conduct an investigation and evaluation on wh at happened and how and why it happened. GEI CONSULTANTS, INC. SOP No. HS-006 Revision No. 5 Revised Date: September 2016 5 of 5 SOP No. HS-006 The Corporate Health and Safety Officer (CHSO) will then recommend (as necessary) engineering controls, persona l protection equipment, trai ning or other appropriate measures to minimize the potential for fu ture injuries. The CH SO/RHSO may develop educational information based on lessons le arned for distribution to GEI employees. 1.7 Limitations Follow safety procedures as defined in the site-specific HASP. Appr opriate PPE must be worn correctly to provide the intended level of protection. Some states, including Massac husetts, require a trench permit prior to trenching or excavation activities. Verification of local re quirements will be evaluated in the planning stage. 1.8 References OSHA 29 CFR 1926.650 - Subpart Excavation Safety - viewed on 9/13/2016 https://www.osha.gov/OshDoc/data_Hurri cane_Facts/trench_excavation_fs.pdf 1.9 Attachments None 1.10 Contact Health&SafetyTeam@geiconsultants.com 1.11 Review History September 2016 May 2014 November 2013 January 2011 Initial Version Date Unknown GEI CONSULTANTS, INC. SOP No. HS-008a Revision No. 5 Revised Date: June 2016 1 of 5 SOP No. HS-008a STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES SOP No. HS-008a Non-Powered Hand Tools 1.1 Objective This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is intended for use by employees working with non-powered hand tools. The site-specific health and safety plan (HASP) should include a hazard assessment for the project that identifie s the hazards associated with the non-powered hand tools that will be used. These hazards s hould be reviewed during the project safety briefing and documented on the Project Safety Br iefing form, found on the Safety page of the GEI intranet. 1.2 General Misuse of hand tools accounts for the majority of accidents and injuries involving hand tools. Only use a tool for the task which it was designe d for. If the right tool isn't available contact the Project Manager and discu ss what is needed. Improper ma intenance is another leading cause of injuries. Employees using hand tools may be exposed to a number of other potentially serious hazards: falling objects (i.e ., objects can fall as a re sult of contact with tools or objects which are abrasive or splash), harmful dust, fumes mist s, vapors, and gases, as well as contact with el ectrical power sources. 1.2.1 Condition of Tools All hand tools, whether furnished by GEI or the employee, will be maintained in safe working condition. All hand tools must be inspecte d before use. Never use a tool if its handle has splinters, burrs, cracks , splits or if the head of the tool is loose. Never use impact tools such as hammers, chisels, punches or steel st akes having mushroomed (flattened) heads. Tag worn, damaged or defective tools \"Out of Se rvice\" and do not use them; notify your Branch Manager or Project Manager so that the tool can be replaced or repair ed. If the tools cannot be repaired they will be disposed of properl y. GEI does not issue or permit the use of unsafe hand tools. 1.2.2 Personal Protective Equipment Employees using hand tools will be provided w ith the personal protective equipment (PPE) necessary to protect them from the hazard of the tool as well as the associated hazards with using the tool. (i.e., projectile debris, dust, etc. ). All employees will wear work gloves, steel toe or composite toe boots, and safety glasses at a minimum. In addition, face shields and hearing protection may be required. Most hand in jures can be avoided with the proper use of PPE. PPE must be maintained in good condition, kept clean and properly stored when not in use. More information regarding PPE is locate d in Section 6 of GEI's Corporate Health and Safety Program. GEI CONSULTANTS, INC. SOP No. HS-008a Revision No. 5 Revised Date: June 2016 2 of 5 SOP No. HS-008a 1.2.3 General Safe Practices Never wear sandals, open-toed or canvas shoes when working with tools. Always tie back long hair. Avoid loose-fitting clothes which might become entangled in a tool. Always remove rings and other jewelry. Make sure your grip and footing are secure when using large tools. Never carry tools up ladde rs; use a tool belt, hoist, or a rope. Use extra caution when using tools at heights - a falling tool could kill a co-worker. Always pass a tool to another person by the handle - never toss it to them. Ne ver use a tool with ha nds are wet, oily, or greasy. Select ergonomically-designed tools for work tasks when movements are repetitive and forceful. Always make sure observers are at a safe distance. Always secure work with a vice, clamp, or other support. 1.3 Non-Power Hand Tools Non-powered hand tools include anything from axes to wrenches. Even though the tool is powered by human inertia, injuries from im proper use of non-powered hand tools often involve severe disabilities. 1.3.1 Knives Only use a knife with a sharpened blade. Pu ll the knife through the object and away from your body; pulling motions are easier to manage. Never use a knife if its handle has splinters, burrs, cracks, splits or if the blade is loose. Kn ives should never be used as screwdrivers, pry bars, or can openers. Never pick up knives by th eir blades. Always carry knives with their tips/points toward the floor. Never carry knives, scissors, or other sh arp tools in pockets. Never attempt to catch a falling knife. When not in use, knives should be stored in sheaths. Box cutters will be self-retracting. 1.3.2 Wrenches Never use wrenches that are bent, cracked, ba dly chipped, or having l oose or broken handles. Discard any wrench with spread or battered jaws ; if the handle is ben t; or if a wrench has broken or battered points and notify your Bran ch Manager so that a replacement can be made. Never slip a pipe over a single head wrench handle to increase leverage. Never use a shim to make a wrench fit. Pull on a wrench using a slow, steady motion. Do not use push force on a wrench; you could lose your balance if the wrench slips. 1.3.3 Screwdrivers Always match the size and type of screwdriver bl ade to fit the head of the screw. Do not hold the work piece against your body while using a sc rewdriver. Never put y our fingers near the tip of a screwdriver when tightening a screw. Never use a screwdriver to make a starting hole for screws. Never use a screwdriver as a chis el, pry bar, or nail puller. When performing electrical work, always use an insulated scre wdriver. Never use a sc rewdriver to test the charge of a battery. GEI CONSULTANTS, INC. SOP No. HS-008a Revision No. 5 Revised Date: June 2016 3 of 5 SOP No. HS-008a 1.3.4 Hammers Never use a hammer if your hands are oily, gr easy or wet. Always check behind you before swinging a hammer. Use a claw hammer for pulli ng nails. Never strike nails or other objects with the \"cheek\" of the hammer. Do not strike a hardened steel surface, such as a cold chisel, with a claw hammer. Never strike one hammer against another hammer. Never use a hammer as a wedge or a pry bar. 1.3.5 Pliers Never use pliers which are cracked, broken, or sprung. Never use pliers as a wrench or a hammer. Do not attempt to force pliers by us ing a hammer on them. Never slip a pipe over the handles of pliers to incr ease leverage. When performing electrical work, always use insulated pliers. When using diagonal cutting pliers, shield loose pieces of cut material from flying into the air by using a cloth or your gloved hand. 1.3.6 Snips Never use snips as a hammer, screwdriver, or pry bar. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles when using snips to cut materials. Always wear work gloves when cutting materials with snips. Keep the blade aligned by tighten ing the nut and bolt of the snips. Never use straight cut snips to cut curves. Always use the locking clip on the snips when you have finished using them. Never leave or store snips in the open position. 1.3.7 Hand Saws Always keep handsaws sharp and free of rust to prevent them from binding or jumping. Never carry a saw by the blade. Always hold the work piece firmly against a work table. Keep control of saws by releasing downward pre ssure at the end of the stroke. Never use an adjustable blade saw such as a hacksaw, coping saw, keyhole saw, or bow saw, if the blade is not taut. Oil saw blades after each use. Never force the saw through the cut as this may cause the saw to buckle or fly out of the groove and cause injury. 1.3.8 Chisels Only use sharpened chisels. Never use chisels having mushroomed (flatte ned) striking heads. Whenever possible, hold a chisel by using a tool holder. Clamp small work pieces in a vise and chip towards the stationary jaw of the vise . Chip or cut away from yourself and keep both hands in back of the cutting edge. Alwa ys wear safety glasses or a face shield. 1.3.9 Vise and Clamps Never use a vise having worn or broken jaw inse rts, or having cracks or fractures in the body of the vise. Position the work piece in the vise so the entire face of the jaw supports the work piece. When clamping a long work piece in a vise, support the far end of the work piece by using an adjustable pipe stand or saw horse. Never slip a pipe over the handle of a vise to increase leverage. Never use a C-clamp for hoi sting materials. Never use a C-clamp as a permanent fastening device. GEI CONSULTANTS, INC. SOP No. HS-008a Revision No. 5 Revised Date: June 2016 4 of 5 SOP No. HS-008a 1.3.10 Jacks A manufacture's rated capacity must be clearly marked on all jacks and all jacks must have a stop indicator. When using a jack, never exc eed the capacity of the stop indicator. Jacks should be lubricated and inspected regularly. Wh en setting up a jack, ensure the base is centered on a firm, level surface. The jack head should also be placed ag ainst a level surface. Lift force should be applied evenly. Put a block under the base of the jack when the foundation is not firm. If it seems likely the cap could slip, place a block between the jack cap and load. Immediately block the load after it is lifted. 1.4 Injury Reporting If a GEI employee suffers an inju ry on the job that is not life threating, call Medcor Triage at 1-800-775-5866 to speak with a medical professi onal. Then, immediately report the injury to the Supervisor/Project Manager and Regional Safety Officer. After verbal notification has b een made, an Incident Report Form is to be completed by the employee and/or supervisor/project manager and submitted to the People & Safety Team immediately following care of the incident. This form is available on the Safety App (smart phones) and on the Safety page on the GEI intranet. Upon notification from a Branch or Office Mana ger, Human Resources, and/or the receipt of the Incident Report Form, the Regional Health & Safety Officer (RHSO) will conduct an investigation and evaluation on what happened and how and why it happened. The Corporate Health & Safety Officer (CHSO) will then r ecommend (as necessary) engineering controls, personal protection equipment, training or ot her appropriate measures to minimize the potential for future injuries. The CHSO/RHS O may develop educational information based on lessons learned for dist ribution to GEI employees. 1.5 Limitations Follow safety procedures as defined in the site-specific HASP or in the manufacturer's specifications. Appropriate PPE must be worn correctly to provide the intended level of protection. If a hand tool is being used that is not identifi ed in this SOP consult the manufacturer's literature and c ontact the Safety Team so we can include the information in a future version of this SOP. 1.6 References OSHA Standards for the Cons truction Industry, Subpart I Risk Analytics, LLC Hand Tools Training, 2006 1.7 Attachments None GEI CONSULTANTS, INC.

SOP No. HS-009 Revision No. 5 Revised Date: July 2016 1 of 7 SOP NO. HS-009 STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES SOP NO. HS-009 Hazardous Su bstances Exposure Management 1.1 Objective This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is intended to outline the steps GEI employees will take to identify potential hazards associated with exposure to hazardous substances, the risks associated with these hazards, a nd the proper controls to use to minimize exposure. The site-specific health and safe ty plan (HASP) should include a hazard assessment for the project that identifie s the potential of en countering a hazardous substance and the control methods to be implemented by GEI employees. These hazards should be reviewed in the project safety briefing and documented on the Project Safety Briefing form, found on the Safety page of the GEI intranet. 1.2 General A hazardous substance is any substance that has one or more of the following intrinsic properties: Explosiveness Flammability Ability to oxidize Human toxicity (acute or chronic) Corrosiveness (to human tissue or metal) Ecotoxicity (with or w ithout bioaccumulation) Capacity, on contact with air or water, to develop one or more of the above properties 1.3 Hazard Identification An initial identification of hazards should be done based on a review of available documents including lists of chemicals used on site, analytical data from soil, surface water, groundwater, air, spill history, site history, equipment on site, maps, photos, and a preliminary survey. Once hazardous substances are identified th e regulated exposure limits need to be identified. Each substance may have a stat e/federal exposure value for each of the following (if applicable): Action Level - An airborne level, typically one-half of the permissible exposure limit (PEL) designated in Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) substance-specific standards, 29 CFR 1910, Subpart Z, calculated as an GEI CONSULTANTS, INC. SOP No. HS-009 Revision No. 5 Revised Date: July 2016 2 of 7 SOP NO. HS-009 8-hour time weighted average, which init iates certain required activities such as exposure monitoring and medical surveillance. Ceiling Limit - The exposure limit a worker's exposure may never exceed. Sampling and Analytical Error - A statistical estimate of the uncertainty associated with a given exposure measurement. Short-Term Exposure Limit (STEL) - The average exposure to a contaminant to which a worker may be exposed dur ing a short time period (typically 15-30 minutes). Time Weighted Average (TWA) - The average exposure to a contaminant over a given period of time, typically 8 hours. 1.4 Risk Identification Once the presence and concentrations of specific hazardous substances and health hazards have been established, the risks a ssociated with these substances will be identified. GEI employees and GEI subcontractors who will be working on the site will be informed of risks that have been identified. Risks to consider include, but are not limited to: Potential exposures exceeding the permissible exposure limits and published exposure levels Potential Immediately Dangerous to Li fe and Health (IDLH) concentrations Potential skin absorption and irritation sources Potential eye irritation sources Potential hazardous atmospheres, incl uding oxygen deficiency and fire and explosion hazards 1.5 Engineering Controls, Wo rk Practices, and Personal Protective Equipment for Employee Protection Engineering controls, work practices, and personnel protective equipment (PPE) for substances regulated in OSHA Subpart G (Occupational Health and Environmental Control) and Subpart Z (Toxic and Hazardous Substances) will be implemented in to protect employees from exposure to hazardous s ubstances and safety and health hazards. 1.5.1 Elimination/Substitution The first control method should be to try and eliminate or substitute the hazards with a safer alternative. This is the most effectiv e solution as shown is Figure 1 below. If you can remove the hazard than you no longer n eed to find a way to protect the employee GEI CONSULTANTS, INC. SOP No. HS-009 Revision No. 5 Revised Date: July 2016 3 of 7 SOP NO. HS-009 from it. Or you can substitute a different pi ece of equipment or chemical to use that doesn't pose the same hazard and doesn't create a new one. 1.5.2 Engineering Controls Engineering controls implement physical change to the workplace, which eliminates/reduces the hazard on the job/task. Examples include: Change the process to minimize c ontact with hazardous chemicals Isolate or enclose the process Use of wet methods to reduce generati on of dusts or other particulates General dilution ventilation Use of fume hoods 1.5.3 Administrative Cont rols (Work Practices) Administrative controls establ ish efficient processes or proc edures to help protect the employee. Examples of these are: Rotate job assignments Adjust work schedules so that work ers are not overexposed to a hazardous chemical 1.5.4 Personal Protective Equipment The use of PPE to reduce exposure to risk fact ors is the last line of defense. All other options should be exhausted before use of PPE. Examples of PPE are: Chemical protective clothing Respiratory protection Gloves Eye or hearing protection Steel toe boots GEI CONSULTANTS, INC. SOP No. HS-009 Revision No. 5 Revised Date: July 2016 4 of 7 SOP NO. HS-009 Figure 1: Hazard Mitigation Effectiveness Pyramid 1.5.5 Engineering Controls, Work Practices, and PPE for Substances Regulated in Subparts G and Subpart Z Engineering controls and work practices will be instituted to reduce and maintain employee exposure at or below the PELs fo r substances regulated by 29 CFR Part 1910. Engineering controls that may be feasible in clude the use of pressurized cabs or control booths on equipment, and/or the use of remo tely operated material handling equipment. Work practices may include removing non-essential employees from potential exposure during opening of drums, wetting down dusty operations, and positioning employees upwind of potent ial hazards. If engineering controls and wo rk practices are not feasible, or not required, a reasonable combination of engineering controls, work pr actices, and PPE will be used to reduce and maintain at or below the PELs or dose limits for substances regulated by 29 CFR Part 1910, Subpart Z. GEI will not implement a schedule of employ ee rotation as a means of compliance with PELs or dose limits except when there is no other feasible way of complying with the airborne or dermal dose lim its for ionizing radiation. The provisions of 29 CFR, subpart G, will be followed. GEI CONSULTANTS, INC. SOP No. HS-009 Revision No. 5 Revised Date: July 2016 5 of 7 SOP NO. HS-009 1.5.6 Engineering Controls, Work Practices, and Personal Protective Equipment for Substances Not Regulated in Subparts G and Subparts Z An appropriate combination of engineering controls, work practices, and PPE will be used to reduce and maintain employee exposure to or below published exposure levels for hazardous substances and health h azards not regulated by 29 CFR Part 1910, Subparts G and Subparts Z. GEI will use publis hed literature and Safety Data Sheets (SDS) as a guide in making the determination of what level of prot ection is appropriate for hazardous substances and health hazards for which there is no permissible exposure limit or published exposure limit. 1.5.7 Decontamination Procedures Decontamination procedures will be de veloped, communicated to employees, and implemented before employees or equipmen t enter areas on site where potential for exposure to hazardous substances exists. Pr ocedures will be developed to minimize employee contact with hazardous substances or with equipment that has contacted hazardous substances. GEI employees leaving a contaminated area will be properly decontaminated; contaminated clothing and equipment leav ing a contaminated area will be properly disposed of or decontaminated. Decontamination procedures will be monito red by the site safety officer (SSO) to determine their effectiveness. When such procedures are found to be ineffective, the site safety officer will contact the Corporate Health and Safety Officer and appropriate steps will be taken to correct deficiencies. Location Decontamination will be performed in ar eas that will minimize the exposure to employees, equipment, and the environment. Equipment and Solvents Equipment and solvents used for decontamination will be decontaminated or disposed of properly. Personal Protective Clothing and Equipment Protective clothing and equipment will be decontaminated, cleaned, laundered, maintained, or replaced as needed to maintain their effectiveness. Employees whose clothing comes in contact with hazardous substances will immediately remove that clothing and follow the directions on packaging or SDS sheet for how to properly clean the exposed area. The clothing will be dispos ed of or decontaminated before it is removed from the work zone. GEI CONSULTANTS, INC. SOP No. HS-009 Revision No. 5 Revised Date: July 2016 6 of 7 SOP NO. HS-009 Commercial Laundries or Cleaning Establishments Commercial laundries or cleaning establishmen ts that decontaminat e protective clothing or equipment will be informed of the poten tially harmful effects of exposures to hazardous substances. Showers and Changing Rooms Where the decontamination procedure indicates a need for regular showers and change rooms outside of a contaminated area, these will be provided and meet the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.141 (Sanitation). If temperature conditions prevent the effective use of water, then other effective means for cleansing will be provided and used. 1.6 Injury Reporting If a GEI employee suffers an injury on the job that is not life threating, call Medcor Triage at 1-800-775-5866 to speak with a me dical professional.

SOP No. HS-010 Revision No. 5 Revised Date: June 2016 1 of 4 SOP No. HS-010 STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES SOP No. HS-010 Inclement Weather 1.1 Objective This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is intended for use by employees engaged in work with the potential to be affected by in clement weather. The s ite-specific health and safety plan (HASP) should in clude a hazard assessment for the project that identifies the potential for working in inclement weather a nd the control methods to be implemented by GEI employees. These hazards should be reviewed in the project safety briefing and documented on the Project Safety Briefing fo rm, found on the Safety page of the GEI intranet. 1.2 General Employees should be aware of local weather conditions and monitor advisories issued by the National Weather Service and other local reporting services. Depending on location and season, storms are capable of producing heavy rain, floods, extreme temperatures, high wind conditions, lighting, to rnados, and/or snowfall. 1.2.1 Heavy Rain If working or driving in a rain storm, us e extreme caution. When driving, turn your low beam lights on when the rainfall becomes heavy. Employees should be aware of the following: Heavy rain decreases visibilit y, especially when driving. Surfaces and tools become slippery. If you are working in the rain and your clothes become wet th ere is a risk of hypothermia when exposed to winds, even in warm temperatures. If the storms are going to produce thunder and/or lightning, leave the work area immediately and move to a safe area. Use your best judgment to determine if the rainfall becomes too heavy to continue working safely. 1.2.2 Lightning Lightning can strike as far as 10 miles fr om the area where it is raining. That's approximately the distance you can hear thunder. If you can hear thunder, you are within striking distance. Seek safe shelter immediately. This can be within a building or vehicle. Wait 30 minutes after the last clap of thunder or flash of lightning before going outside again. GEI CONSULTANTS, INC. SOP No. HS-010 Revision No. 5 Revised Date: June 2016 2 of 4 SOP No. HS-010 1.2.3 Flooding Flooding may occur as a result of heavy rain in a short period of time. Flooding can be particularly acute in canyon areas where dry cr eek beds can turn into raging rivers from rainfall in distant or higher elevation ar eas. Be aware of this and your surroundings and move to a safe place if you begin to see signs that flooding may occur. Signs of potential flooding include sudden appearance of water in dry creek beds, increa sed water flow in rivers or streams, or qui ck rise in water levels. Do not attempt to drive through areas or street s that are flooded. Seek alternate routes. Be particularly cautious at night when flooded ar eas are difficult to see. Urban flooding can stop traffic; increase the poten tial for traffic accidents; and can trap people in vehicles. 1.2.4 Extreme Temperatures Work activities may take place in extreme heat or cold. Be prepared if these conditions are anticipated. Have the appropriate pers onal protective equipment (PPE) available; exercise proper fluid intake; and take breaks to prevent heat and cold stress. For more information about these conditions see the heat stress and cold stress programs found in GEI's Health and Safety Program. 1.2.5 High Winds, Tropical Storms, and Tornados High Winds can be extremely dangerous. Appropriate measures will be taken to secure equipment and loose items when working in windy conditions. The project manager should be contacted about the weather condi tions and, if necessary, work should be postponed. Tropical storms are described as storms with sustained winds ranging from 39 to 73 miles per hour (mph) and hurricanes produce sustai ned winds that exceed 74 mph. When winds approach 40 mph (gale force winds) twigs begi n to break off of trees and vehicles will veer off of the road. When winds approach 40 mph or the GEI employee feels unsafe based on the activities being performed, stop work and seek shelter as soon as possible. Blowing or falling debris and overhanging limbs/signs can be a significant hazard. If possible, avoid driving in th ese conditions; 70 percent of in juries during hurricanes are a result of vehicle accidents. Note that tall or elevated equipment will have manufacturer's safe operating wind speeds defined that c ould be less than 40 mph. The operator's manual should be consulted prior to operation of the equipment. A tornado is a violent, dangerous, rotating colu mn of air that is in contact with both the surface of the earth and a cumulonimbus cloud or, in rare cases, the base of a cumulus cloud. The Fujita Scale is used to rate the intensity of a tornado by examining the damage caused by the tornado after it has passed over a man-made structure. Based on the Fujita Scale, or F-Scale, numbers begin at F0 : 40-72 mph and go to F6: 319-379 mph (F6 is GEI CONSULTANTS, INC. SOP No. HS-010 Revision No. 5 Revised Date: June 2016 3 of 4 SOP No. HS-010 generally theoretical). Nearly three-fourths of tornados are on the weak F0-F1 scale with just over two-thirds of deaths resulting from the violent F4-F5 tornados. If a tornado is seen, stop work and seek shel ter immediately. If a to rnado siren is sounded move immediately to safety indoors and th en move to a windowless interior space, basement, stairwell, or designated fall-out shelter. Windows should not be opened before an oncoming tornado. If there is no shelte r available, seat belt yourself into your stationary vehicle or seek a depression or low spot on the land surface. 1.2.6 Snowfall and Ice Conditions Working in the winter months may result in activities taking place during periods of snowfall or icy conditions. If you are work ing during or after snow has fallen, dress appropriately for the conditions. Snow and ice can cause working surfaces to become slippery. Clear snow and ice from work areas to prevent slip hazards. Use caution when performing snow or ice removal activities to prevent injuries. Driving in snowy and icy conditions is also hazardous. Reduce speed and use caution if you must drive in these conditions. If the weather conditions deteriorate and you do not feel safe working in these conditions, stop work, move to a safe indoor location, and contact your project manager to let them know the weather, work c onditions, and your location. 1.3 Injury Reporting If a GEI employee suffers an injury on the job that is not life threating, call Medcor Triage at 1-800-775-5866 to speak with a me dical professional. Then, immediately report the injury to the Supervisor/Project Manager and Regional Safety Officer. After verbal notification has been made, an Incident Report Form is to be completed by the employee and/or Supervisor/Project Manager and submitted to the People & Safety Team immediately following care of the incident. This form is available on the Safety App (smart phones) and on the Safe ty page on the GEI intranet.

SOP No. HS-012 Revision No. 5 Revised Date: June 2016 1 of 4 SOP No. HS-012 STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES SOP No. HS-012 Noise Exposures 1.1 Objective This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is intended for use by employees engaged in work with elevation noise levels. The site-spe cific health and safety plan (HASP) should include a hazard assessment for the project that identifies the potential for work in loud environments and the control methods to be implemented by GEI employees. These hazards should be reviewed in the project safety briefing and documented on the Project Safety Briefing form, found on the Safety page of the GEI intranet. 1.2 General Working in loud environments can cause hearing damage and loss if the proper protection is not in place. The following pr ocedures describe methods to mitigate unhealthy noise levels and protect hearing. 1.3 Hazard Identification If projects involve noise leve ls above OSHA regulations, em ployees should take steps to remove the noise exposure. Common sources of elevated noise levels are heavy equipment, power tools, pumps, and gene rators. GEI has an established Hearing Conservation Program located in the GEI Health and Safety Program. 1.4 Risk Identification Hearing protection is required if noise levels in a work area are known to be above 85 decibels (dB), which can be measured with a noise meter. When decibel levels are not known, hearing protection is requ ired if you need to raise your voice to talk to someone standing within a normal speaking distance from you. 1.5 Mitigation There are three options that can be used to help mitigate a noise hazard: 1.) Remove the hazard by taking away the source of the noise. 2.) Remove the employee from the source of the noise. 3.) Provide the employee with appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). The first option for employee protection is to remove the hazard by taking away the source of the noise or using engineer ing controls to reduce the level. GEI CONSULTANTS, INC. SOP No. HS-012 Revision No. 5 Revised Date: June 2016 2 of 4 SOP No. HS-012 If this cannot be accomplished, the next cont rol measure is to remove the employee from the source. This can be done by moving the wo rk area to a quieter location or distancing the employee from the noise source. For example, GEI employees do not need to be standing next to an operating drill rig or other heavy equipment. By distancing themselves from heavy equipment or other no ise sources the need for hearing protection can be eliminated/reduced. The final option, if the above two options aren 't feasible, disposable ear plugs that are made available to GEI employees are to be used. Additional means of hearing protection will be provided, such as ear muffs, if the disposable ear plugs are not adequate. When using hearing protection, employees will need to make a greater effort to be aware of the surroundings which may include moving e quipment, traffic, and other site hazards. 1.6 Proper Use of Hearing Protection DISPOSABLE EAR PLUG FITTING INSTRUCTIONS Before fitting any ear plugs, m ake sure your hands are clean. Foam ear plugs are disposable and not intended for reuse. Hold the ear plug between your thumb and forefinger. Roll and compress the entire ear plug to a small, crease-free cylinder. While still rolling, use your other hand to reach over your head and pull up and back on your outer ear. This straighten s the ear canal, making way for a snug fit. Insert the ear plug and hold for 20 to 30 seconds. Thi s allows the ear plug to expand and fill your ear canal. Test the fit. In a noisy environm ent, and with earplugs inserted, cup both hands over your ears and release. You should not notice a significant difference in the noi se level. If the noise seems to lessen when your hands are cupped over your ears, your ear plugs are not fitted properly. Carefully remove the earplugs (see instructions below) and refit following instructions, above. GEI CONSULTANTS, INC. SOP No. HS-012 Revision No. 5 Revised Date: June 2016 3 of 4 SOP No. HS-012 Always remove ear plugs slowly, twisting them to break the seal. If you remove them too quickly, you could damage your ear drum. REUSABLE EAR PLUG FITTING INSTRUCTIONS Before fitting any ear plugs, make sure your hands are clean. Reusable ear plugs should be inspected and cleaned often in soapy water. If they become hard, torn, or deformed they should be discarded and replaced. Reach around your head and pull up and back on y our outer ear. This straightens out the ear canal, making way for a snug fit. Hold the stem end of the ear plug and insert it well inside your ear canal until you feel it sealing and the fit is comfortable. Test the fit. In a noisy environm ent, and with ear plugs inserted, cup both hands over your ears and release. You should not noti ce a significant difference in the noise level. If the noise seems to lessen when your hands are cupped over your ears, your ear plugs are not fitted properly. Carefully remove the ear plugs (see instructions below) and refit following instructions, above. Always remove ear plugs slowly, twisting them to break the seal. If you remove them too quickly, you could damage your ear drum. 1.7 Injury Reporting If a GEI employee suffers an injury on the job that is not life threating, call Medcor Triage at 1-800-775-5866 to speak with a medi cal professional. Then, immediately report the injury to the Supervisor/Project Manager and Regional Safety Officer.

The site-specific health and safety plan (HASP) will include a hazard assessment for the project that identifies the potential fo r exposure to traffic hazards and the control methods to be implemented by GEI employees , including review or attainment of necessary permits, traffic contro l plans, and flagger/police de tail requirements for the local jurisdiction. Routine checks of the work zone will be made to ensure there are adequate levels of protection. These hazards will be re viewed in the project safety briefing and documented on the Project Safety Briefing fo rm, found on the Safety page of the GEI intranet. 1.3 Traffic Hazard Management Traffic Hazard Management is the process of identifying and managing the potential risks associated with the movement of traffic th rough, around, or past a work area. This Traffic Hazard Management SOP is designed to assi st employees in identifying and managing these hazards. Work areas should be as safe as possible. It is the responsibility of GEI employees to follow the Traffic Hazard Management SOP and adhere to these safety standards. Safety is not negotiable. Under no circumstances are GEI employees permitted to commence work in a situation that the employee believes or knows their health and sa fety, or the health and safety of others, is at risk. Major risk factors for work site Traffic Hazard Management include: The speed of traffic moving through a work site. The distance and clearance between m oving traffic, workers, vehicles and equipment, and over-head power lines. Traffic volume and vehicle composition. Nature and conditions at the work site and approaches to the work site. GEI CONSULTANTS, INC. SOP No. HS-016 Revision No. 5 Revised Date: November 2016 2 of 4 SOP No. HS-016 Other factors such as the time of day, sight distance, weather, presence of pedestrians, or cyclists, and the type of work being carried out. Other hazards in proximity to the work site (e.g., power lines, open excavations) that may have conflicting safety management measures that need to be considered when developing the HASP. 1.4 Site Preparation The following management measures will be cons idered whenever working in traffic areas. In addition, remain aware of the amount of traffic around the working area. The work space should be large enough for the job to be comp leted safely. Check permit, traffic control plans, and flagger/police detail requirements for the local jurisdiction. Perform routine checks of the work zone to make sure th ere are adequate leve ls of protection. 1.4.1 Traffic Barriers and Warning Signs GEI employees will comply with the U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT) Manual on Uniformed Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD ) and/or state regulations for temporary traffic barriers (cones, barriers) and sign pl acement when required for working in traffic areas. Clearly define the work site by pl acing traffic barriers around the work space to indicate the space that is needed to safely perform the work. The traffic barrier will help make the work site more visible to other workers, pedestrians, cyclists, and moving vehicles. Place traffic barriers in such a wa y as to give yourself and equipment adequate space to work within the barriers. OSHA s uggests placing the first warning sign at a distance calculated to be 4 to 8 times (in feet) the speed limit (in MPH). 1.4.2 Adequate Light Requirements for night conditions and work areas with poor vi sibility are similar to day requirements. However there are a number of additional things to consider, such as visibility of the work site to advancing traffic and sufficient lighting. OSHA requires lighting for workers on foot and equipment opera tors to be at least 5-foot-candles or greater. Visibility of the work area can be in creased by employing the following measures: Using parked vehicles hazard and flashing lights. Wearing reflective personal protective equipm ent (PPE), such as a safety vest, in good condition. Providing adequate lighting to illuminate the work area with lights positioned so that there is no glare to approaching drivers. Placing reflective advance warning signs and tr affic barriers so that they are visible to road users. GEI CONSULTANTS, INC. SOP No. HS-016 Revision No. 5 Revised Date: November 2016 3 of 4 SOP No. HS-016 1.4.3 Distance from the Nearest Traffic Lane Work areas located along roadsides will have a minimum clearance as defined by DOT's MUTCD and/or state or local DOT regulations for traffic ba rrier and sign placement. 1.4.4 PPE The proper PPE, as outlined in the project HASP, will be worn when appropriate. The color/type of safety vest will comply with site regulations. 1.5 Equipment Operation Vehicles and heavy equipment operators shou ld use a spotter when possible if it is necessary to drive in reverse to reduce risk of collision with oncoming traffic. If it is necessary to drive against the flow of traffic ma ke sure this area is within the work zone and properly blocked off from oncoming traffic. 1.6 Pedestrian Safety When working near pedestrian traffic, a safe alternate pedestrian route will be established. Refer to local regulations when establishing pedestrian walkways. 1.7 Injury Reporting If a GEI employee suffers an inju ry on the job that is not life threating, call Medcor Triage at 1-800-775-5866 to speak with a medical pr ofessional. Then, im mediately report the injury to the Supervisor/Project Manager a nd Regional Health & Safe ty Officer (RHSO). After verbal notification has b een made, an Incident Report Form is to be completed by the employee and/or Supervisor/Project Manager and submitted to the People & Safety Team immediately following care of the incident. This form is available on the Safety App (smart phones) and on the Safety page on the GEI intranet.

The SOP is intended to comply with state regulations and safe work practices developed by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). Modifications to meet these requirements will be made to this program as changing laws or regulations dictate. 1.2 General Lifting heavy items is one of the leading cau ses of injury in the workplace. Overexertion and cumulative trauma when lifting are signif icant factors for injuries. When employees use smart lifting practices and work in their \" power zone\", they are less likely to suffer from back sprains, muscle pulls, wrist/elbow /spinal and other inju ries caused by lifting heavy objects. Common things to consider prior to lifting an object are: we ight of the object, awkward postures, high-frequency and long duration lifting, inadequate handholds, and physical/environmental factors. Figure 1: Lifting Power Zone GEI CONSULTANTS, INC. SOP No. HS-025 Revision No. 2 Revised Date : July 2016 2 of 5 SOP No. HS-025 1.3 Safe Lifting Guidelines The following safe lifting guidelines will be followed by employees involved in manual lifting activities: Before manual lifting is performed, a h azard assessment must be completed. The assessment must consider size, bulk, and weight of the object(s), if mechanical lifting equipment is required, if two-ma n lift is required, whether vision is obscured while carrying and the walking surface and path where the object is to be carried. Get a co-worker to help if equipment or other item is too heavy to lift. If possible, use powered equipment inst ead of manually lifting heavy materials. Lifting equipment such as dollies, hand truc ks, lift-assist devices, jacks, or carts can be provided for employees. Reduce lifts from shoulder height and from floor height by repositioning the shelf or bin to closer to the power zone. Make sure walkways are clear of tri pping hazards before moving materials. Use your legs and keep your back in a natural position while lifting. Keep the load close to your torso. Test the load to be lifted to estimate its weight, size, and bulk and to determine the proper lifting method. Do not twist while carrying a load. Instead, shift your feet and take small steps in the direction you want to turn. Make sure there are appropriately marked and sufficiently safe clearances for aisles and at loading docks or passageways where mechanical-handling equipment is used. Properly stack loose or unboxed material s which might fall from a pile by blocking, interlocking, or limiting the height of the pile to prevent falling hazards. Bags, containers, bundles, etc. should be stored in tiers that are stacked, blocked, interlocked, and limited in height so that they are stable and secure to prevent sliding or collapse. GEI CONSULTANTS, INC. SOP No. HS-025 Revision No. 2 Revised Date : July 2016 3 of 5 SOP No. HS-025 Storage areas should be kept free from accumulation of materials that could lead to tripping, fire, or explosion. Work methods and stations should be de signed to minimize the distance between the person and the object being handled. Supervisors should periodically evaluate work areas and employees' work techniques to assess the potential for and prevention of in juries. New operations s hould be evaluated to engineer out hazards before work processes are implemented. 1.4 Regulations OSHA does not have a standard which sets limits on how much a person may lift or carry. They do however state that lifting lo ads heavier than about 50 pounds will increase the risk of injury. The National Institute for Occupational Sa fety and Health (NIOSH) has developed a mathematical model that helps predict the risk of injury based on th e weight being lifted and other criteria. The NIOSH model is based on previous medical research into the compressive forces needed to cause damage to bones and ligaments of the back. The mathematical model is incorporated in the Applications Manual for the Revised NIOSH Lifting Equation, which can be found on the NIOSH website (http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/94 -110/). It should be noted, however, that this NIOSH document provides only voluntary guidelines. If there is a situation that arises where an employee is re quired to perform manual lifting on a reoccurring basis, the NIOSH Lifting Equation will be used to determine the appropriate weight that em ployee can safely lift. The lifting equation establishes a maximum load of 50 pounds for employees that are less likely to have to lift something, and don't have to do any long distance travel or maneuvering of the item. This 50 pounds is then adjusted to account for: how often the employee is lifting twisting the back during lifting the vertical distance the load is lifted the distance of the load from the body the distance the employee must move while lifting the load how easy it is to hold onto the load GEI uses 50 pounds as a standard. However each individual should not attempt to carry loads heavier than they can safely manage. GEI CONSULTANTS, INC. SOP No. HS-025 Revision No. 2 Revised Date : July 2016 4 of 5 SOP No. HS-025 1.5 Training Training will include general principles of ergonomics, correct manual lifting techniques to avoid musculoskeletal injuries, recogniti on of hazards and injuries, procedures for reporting hazardous conditions, and methods and procedures for early reporting of injuries. 1.6 Lifting Assistance If employees are assigned a task that involve s repetitive lifting and carrying of equipment the Safety Team and Project Manager s hould be contacted to conduct an ergonomic evaluation. The task should be discussed to determine if there is an alternative method that can be used. The alternative method shoul d institute an engineering or administrative control to reduce/limit the am ount of lifting that is requi red of the employee. Some examples include providing smaller containers to reduce the weight of what needs to be lifted; providing a device that helps carry aw kwardly-shaped objects easier; or using a winch, fork lift, or other device to lift the item(s) for the employee. 1.7 Injury Reporting Injuries experienced during manual lifting activities should receive prompt medical attention. If a GEI employee suffers an injury on the job that is not life threating, call Medcor Triage at 1-800-775-5866 to speak with a medical professional. Then, immediately report the injury to the Supervis or/Project Manager and Regional Health and Safety Officer. After verbal notification has been made, an Incident Report Form is to be completed by the employee and/or Supervisor/Project Manager and submitted to the People & Safety Team immediately following care of the incident. This form is available on the Safety App (smart phones) and on the Safe ty page on the GEI intranet. Upon notification from a Branch or Offi ce Manager, Human Resources, and/or the receipt of the Incident Report Form, the Regional Health & Safety Officer (RHSO) will conduct an investigation and evaluation on wh at happened and how and why it happened. The Corporate Health & Safety Officer (C HSO) will then recommend (as necessary) engineering controls, persona l protection equipment, trai ning or other appropriate measures to minimize the potential for futu re musculoskeletal injuries.

An initial iden tification of hazards will be completed based on past and current property usage of the site, what tasks are required to perform the job, what equipment is needed to complete the assigned tasks, what hazards are in the working area etc. The site-specific health and safety plan ( HASP) will include a hazard assessment for the project that identifies the potential hazards a nd how to alleviate the hazard. These hazards will be reviewed in the project safety briefing and documented on the Project Safety Briefing form, found on the Safety page of the GEI intranet. 1.3 Risk Assessment A risk assessment will be performed for all aspects of field work. This analysis is to determine the quantitative or qua litative value of risk related to a tangible situation and a recognized hazard. Identificati on, studies, and monitoring of any hazard to determine its potential, origin, characteristics , and behavior are examples of what could be included and performed during a risk assessment. The assessment will increase awareness of workplace hazards and provide an opportunity to identify and control workplace hazards. 1.3.1 Assessment Guidelines It is necessary to consider certain general gu idelines for assessing the foot, head, eye and face, and hand hazard situations that exist in an occupational operation or process, and to match the protective devices to the particular hazard.

HS-026 Yearly or other pre-determined interval 1.3.2 Hazard Sources Some examples of hazard sources include but are not limited to: Items, materials, or machinery in motion Extreme temperatures Chemical exposures Harmful dust Light radiation Falling objects or potent ial from dropping objects Sharp objects Rolling or pinching objects Layout of workplace and location of co-workers Electrical hazards Noise exposures Confined spaces Working near or on water Fall hazards Traffic or other activitie s taking place on the site Air quality issues 1.4 Prevention - Control Methods Control methods should be consider ed in the following hierarchy: Elimination Substitution Engineering Controls Administrative Controls Personal Protective Equipment 1.4.1 Elimination and Substitution Elimination and substitution, while most effec tive at reducing hazards, also tend to be the most difficult to implement in an existing proces s. If the process is still at the design or development stage, elimination and substitution of hazards may be inexpensive and GEI CONSULTANTS, INC. SOP No. HS-026 Revision No. 1 Revised Date: November 2016 3 of 4 SOP NO. HS-026 simple to implement. For an existing pr ocess, major changes in equipment and procedures may be required to eliminate or substitute for a hazard. Employees should work with the Safety Team to find solutions. 1.4.2 Engineering Controls Engineering controls are used to remove a h azard or place a barrier between the work and the hazard. It's implemented to control the hazard at the source. Examples may include machine guards, sound deading/dampening pa nels, traffic barriers, guardrails, and shields. 1.4.3 Administrative Controls Administrative controls change the work procedures such as programs, schedules, and supervision to reduce employee exposure to hazards. The cont rols are frequently used with existing processes where hazards are not particularly well controlled. Examples of administrative controls are requiring freque nt breaks or implementing a specific method to perform a task. 1.4.4 Personal Protecti ve Equipment Selection To select the proper PPE, the potential hazards must be known. The protective equipment selected must ensure a level of protection greater than the minimum required in order to help protect employees. The user must be supplied with a proper ly fitting protective device and given instructions on care and use. Users must be aware of all warning labels for and limitation of the PPE. Employees must be aware that the PPE does not eliminate the hazard. 1.4.5 Hazard Re-Assessment As necessary, the workplace should be re-assessed for hazards by identifying and evaluating new equipment and processes, revi ewing accident records, and re-evaluating the suitability of previously selected PPE. Re-assessment should occur at a defined regular schedule interval. 1.5 Job Safety Analysis A job safety analysis (JSA) sometimes referred to as a job hazard analysis (JHA) or an activity hazard analysis (AHA) is the breaking down of any method or procedure into its component parts to determine the hazards connected with each key step and the requirements for performing it safely. When a JSA is being created, make sure it isn't too general where the resulting information is not enough to assess the hazard and select proper controls, and be careful not to add unnecessary steps.

The Corporate Health and Safety Officer (CHSO) will then recomm end (as necessary) engineering controls, personal protection equipment, training or ot her appropriate measures to minimize the potential for future injuries. The CHSO/R HSO may develop educational information based on lessons learned for di stribution to GEI employees. 1.7 Limitations Limitations may arise on a project specific ba sis and will be addressed as they arise. 1.8 Attachments None. 1.9 References Risk Analytics, LLC Hazard Assessment Training Program, January 2011 1.10 Contact Health&SafetyTeam@geiconsultants.com 1.11 Review History November 2016 June 2015 Febru ary 3, 2021 - Rev. 4 Coronavirus COVID -19 Preparedness for Field Work & Project Sites TO ACCOMPANY PROJECT HASPs and DISCUSS WITH PROJECT TEAMS Field work will continue to be performed so long as project sites are accessible, and the work can be performed safely. If you have a question about project or site accessibility, ask the GEI project manager and/or client contact about whether there are an y access restrictions in place. If your project is suspended, contact your project manager and branch manager to discuss other assignments. While working in an outdoor environment is better than enclosed areas, the primary precautions we need to continue t o take are distancing and good hygiene. 1.0 COVID -19 and Symptoms DO NOT report to work if you are sick. If you experience a fever or symptoms associated with COVID -19 (fever, cough, shortness of breath), stay at home and contact your licensed healthcare provi der. If you, a household member, or someone you have come into first -hand contact with someone who has a confirmed COVID -19 diagnosis, DO NOT come to work. If you have t ested positive for COVID -19, DO NOT come to work even if you are not experiencing any symptoms of ill ness. 2.0 Reporting GEI h as developed t wo report ing applic ations (A PPs) for employees to use when reporting COVID -19 symptoms, exposures, or positives tests and for com pleting daily COVID -19 screen ing when working in a GEI office or project location. These APPs are available to d ownload to your smartph one ( instructio ns can be found on the GEI COVID -19 Response Page ) or can be used from the GEI COVID Resp onse Share Point and MS T eams plat forms. 2.1 COVID -19 Report ing If you experience C OVID -19 related symptoms , have been in close contact with someone with COVID -19 or have tested positive for COVID -19 yourself , complete the COVID -19 Reporting APP after you have contacted your licensed healthcare provider. After subm itting information into the reporting app, you will be contacted by a member of the Contact Tracing Team to discuss your situation an d provide direction on where to locate appropriate care or testing facilities and discuss return to work timeframes b ased o n the recommendations from the licensed healthcare provider , the continued monitoring of your health, results of COVID -19 tests (if a dministered), and the information described in Section 3.5. If your project has specific COVID -19 reporting requirements, t hese will need to be followed in addition to GEI's reporting. When an employee tests positive for COVID -19 and has been in an office space , deep -cleaning procedures will be triggered . Employees who h ave been in direct or indirect contact with and individu al who has tested positive for COVID -19 a member of the People Team will be in contact to notify you of the potential exposure and provide guidance . 2.2 Daily Screening /Check In If you will be working at a GEI office , project location, or a nother location othe r than you home you must complete GEI 's Daily Check In screening. This is done using the Check In A PP and is to be done each day before you enter the work location. Febru ary 3, 2021 - Rev. 4 The Check In APP will require you to respond to three screening questions: Do you have a cough, shortness of breath or difficult y breathing OR a fever abo ve 100 degrees? Do you ha ve any TWO of the following symptoms: chills , repeated shaking with chills, mu scle pa in, headache , sore throat, or new loss of tas te or smell? Have you been e xposed to, or tested posit ive for COV ID-19? Answering yes to any of these questions will prompt you to not enter th e workplace and contact your healthcare provider. A member of GEI 's Contact Tracing Team will contact you following this submission. Answering no to all of the se questions will allow you to safely proceed to work. The APP automatically will check you into the home office location you are assigned. If you a re entering a place other than this office, type in the location and click submit. 2.3 Project -Specific Monitoring/Screening Clients , general contractors, or projects may have screening procedures in addition to those provided in this document . Understand what these are and what you will need to be able to follow them before a rriving at the project si te and performing work . In addition to underst anding these procedures, plan for the additional time that may be needed to meet these requirements. If you observe a person on a project site showing COVID -19 symptoms, regardless of w hether it is the client, a contractor, or a visitor onsite, immediately notify the site manager and your project manager/ supervisor . 3.0 Distancing & PPE COVID -19 spreads from person -to-person primarily through droplets that are emitted from the initial person to a distance of 6 feet. Maintain a distance of at least 6 feet (2 meters) from others. This includes during site meetings and breaks and while perfo rming work tasks. Meetings should be held outside or by phone/video. Minimize the number of employees in one location to the extent possible. Follow local restrictions for maximum number of people congregated in one location at a time. If tasks need to be performed close to others (within 6 feet) and that cannot be avoided, wear appropriate PPE including a face mask (surgical or cloth), gloves, and eye protection. NOTE: Face masks are not a substitute for distancing. Masks are meant to protect others in cas e you are infected. Contact the Safety Team ( safetyteam@geiconsultants.com ) to discuss any special circumstances and the PPE needed . Wear nitrile gloves as much as practicable and change them frequ ently. As practicable, wash your hands or use sanitizer between glove changes. Wash your hands after wearing gloves. Minimize and stagger time in office spaces to performing essential duties such as picking up and dropping off equipment and samples. If you need to spend more time in a project office (e.g., a construction trailer), it's important that the workspace allows for proper social distancing. When traveling to project sites, travel in separate vehicles. Do not travel in the same vehicle. 4.0 Hygiene Practices Practice the following: Frequent hand washing with soap and warm water for 20 seconds, especially after being in a public place, or after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing. Bringing containers of water and soap with you is a good solution if it isn't present at the project site. If soap and water are not readily available, use hand sanitizer (containing 60% alcohol) until soap and water can be used. Coronavirus COVID -19 Preparedness for Fieldwork & Project Sites GEI Consultants, Inc. Febru ary 3, 2021 - Rev. 4 Cover coughs or sneezes with a tissue, then dispose of the tissue in the trash and wash hands. Cough/sneeze into your elbow if a tissue is not available. Avoid touching your face with your hands. Restroom availability may be limited. Many public locations are now closed or do not allow access into buildings. Identify accessible restrooms prior to beginning work. If unavailable, portable restrooms should be considered. When filling water bottles (for drinking or hand washing) keep the bottle away from the spigot to avoid transfer of germs or contaminants. Do not share water bottles. Wipe down surfaces with disinfectant routinely (at least once per day). This includes fie ld equipment and other items that may have been used by others. This is especially important while working in construction trailers. When using company and personal vehicles, wipe surfaces including the steering wheel, gear shifter, controls, and door hand les before and after use. Handshaking, hugging, or other personal contact to greet others is prohibited. Use greeting from a distance such as a wave. Avoid sharing field equipment and other materials with others. Before using field equipment or putting it away, wipe it down with di sinfectant or wash it with soap and water. Take extra caution using disinfectants while collecting environmental samples to ensure that the samples are not compromised. Do not share PPE including personal hand sanitizer dispensers. Use best practices to mi nimize contact when using publicly shared dispensers. More detail on ways to protect yourself through distancing and hygiene can be found at MIT Medical's website: https://medical.mit.edu/th ree-ways -to-protect 5.0 Use of Public Places If your project requires you to stay in a hotel, practice the disinfecting precautions described above. If you will be eating food/drinks, order take -out or use delivery services at restaurants. Wash your hands bef ore eating. Minimize the use of public transportation traveling to and from project sites. Use your personal vehicle (preferred), GEI vehicle, or a ride service such as Lyft. If you have concerns, discuss them with the project manager, your supervisor, branch manager, and/or with your Regional Safety Manager (RSM) or with Steve Hawkins, Safety Director. 6.0 Resources Additional information can be found through the resources below: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 -ncov/index.html Public Health Agency of Canada https://www.canada.ca/en/public -health/services/diseases/coronavirus Provincial and Local Health Organization https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel -coronavirus -2019 COVID -19 Preparedness for Fieldwork & Project Sites GEI Consultants, Inc. Febru ary 3, 2021 - Rev. 4 7.0 Notifications and Concerns The precautions included in this guidance and in other GEI's employee communications should be practiced at all project site locations and offices. While COVID -19 related information is not expected to be reported through GEI's incident reporting process, the expectation is that all employees will communicate any inconsistencies or concerns with practices at project sites to their project manager, supervisor, branch manager, and RSM. This will allow us to make corrections/updates and provide proper protecti ve measures. Information about preventing COVID -19 exposure is changing regularly. The information included in this guide are general steps we can take while performing field assignments and should be included in HASPs and safety briefings. If you have spe cific situations, questions, or concerns please discuss them with the Project Manager, your RSM, or Steve Hawkins.
