In order to maintain my online status I have to interact with game so I don't time out and log off. This is the only activity that punishes you for trying to continue the activity by clicking the thing you are interacting with. It would make much more sense to keep using the same crystal if you click on the stone, and to cancel if you click off. It simply doesn't feel good to throw away a stone because I clicked the thing I'm already interacting with. It doesn't even start the next stone if you're wanting to power through for the first burst exp. It just cancels the existing one. "}
