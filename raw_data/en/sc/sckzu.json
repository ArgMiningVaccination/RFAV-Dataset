The company is headquartered in New York City, with research and development facilities in Corvallis, Oregon. Our product, TPOXX\u00ae (tecovirimat) that is available in oral and intravenous formulations, is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of smallpox. The European Medicine Agency (EMA) has approved oral TPOXX (under the name Tecovirimat SIGA) for the treatment of smallpox, monkeypox, cowpox, and vaccinia complications following vaccination against smallpox. [Corporate Brochure >](/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/CorporateBrochure_2022.pdf) More than $1 billion in contract value awarded by the U.S. government SIGA's most recent contract with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), primarily for the maintenance of a strategic stockpile of smallpox antiviral therapy, was awarded in September 2018 and has a value in excess of $600 million (if all options are exercised). To date approximately $240 million of TPOXX\u00ae has been delivered under this contract. In 2011, SIGA was awarded a contract with BARDA which led to the delivery of $460 million of oral TPOXX\u00ae to the strategic stockpile. SIGA has worked closely with the U.S. Government during the development of TPOXX\u00ae and has cultivated relationships with key health security constituencies in the U.S. government, including the Biodefense Advanced Research Development Authority (BARDA), the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)/National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID), and the Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense (JPEO-CBRN). These relationships have generated consistent, long-term mutual benefits that have helped to advance the development of TPOXX\u00ae while enhancing U.S. national health security and preparedness against a potential smallpox threat. Proven drug development capability including development under the Animal Rule SIGA has established an end-to-end network with over 20 partners across discovery, pre-clinical, clinical, manufacturing and supply chain that supported development of TPOXX\u00ae and successful delivery of approximately $200 million of courses to the Strategic National Stockpile. In addition, development and approval of TPOXX\u00ae, the first drug approved to treat a disease that no longer exists in the human population, required a unique regulatory approach based on the FDA's Animal Rule. We have developed a robust drug development capability supported through U.S government investment in Biodefense, and our highly externalized cost structure minimizes fixed costs and provides scalability. SIGA intends to leverage the unparalleled expertise, infrastructure, and relationships amassed in support of the TPOXX\u00ae program in additional health security opportunities. Our Product Smallpox is one of the deadliest threats and cannot be addressed with vaccines alone Oral TPOXX\u00ae (tecovirimat) is the first drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that is specifically indicated for the treatment of smallpox disease in adults and pediatric patients weighing at least 13 kg. [(Prescription Label)](https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=fce826ab-4d6a-4139-a2ee-a304a913a253) TPOXX\u00ae inhibits viral maturation of variola virus (the virus that causes smallpox) and other poxviruses by preventing the formation of a secondary viral envelope. In the absence of this envelope, viral particles remain inside the cell and cannot spread to and infect other cells. The most frequently reported adverse reactions were headache and nausea. TPOXX\u00ae Injection, the intravenous (IV) formulation of TPOXX, has also been approved by the FDA for the treatment of smallpox in patients weighing at least 3 kg. This important option will allow patients who are too sick to swallow oral capsules to receive treatment. Healthcare providers can click [here](https://www.siga.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/NDA_Final.pdf) for important prescribing information on proper preparation and administration of TPOXX\u00ae Injection. TPOXX\u00ae is among the first novel small molecule therapies delivered to the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) under Project BioShield, a U.S. government program designed to accelerate the research, development, purchase, and availability of effective medical countermeasures against chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) agents. As the first antiviral agent specifically indicated for the treatment of smallpox, TPOXX\u00ae would play a critical role in responding to a smallpox bioterror attack. Following U.S. approval, Health Canada also authorized the use of oral TPOXX\u00ae for the treatment of human smallpox disease in adults and pediatric patients weighing at least 13 kg. Oral TPOXX\u00ae is supplied to both the Canadian Department of National Defence (DND) and the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) for stockpiling as a key countermeasure.
