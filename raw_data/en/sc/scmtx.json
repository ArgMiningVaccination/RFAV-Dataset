Now they are a thing of the past, and one may well ask how Biden and his new administration might influence the SCAM boom in the US and the rest of the world. Joe Biden has chosen former Food and Drug Administration (FDA) commissioner, Dr. David Kessler, to lead Operation Warp Speed \u2014 the U.S. government's program for accelerating the Covid-19 vaccine and treatments rollout. The [Alliance for Natural Health](https://anh-usa.org/biden-selects-anti-supplement-crusader/) seemed to think that was bad news: Dr. David Kessler, an anti-supplement crusader, drug industry adviser, and former FDA Commissioner, has been named to Biden's COVID-19 task force. We must push back. Action Alert! ... During that time, Kessler demonstrated his hostility towards the dietary supplement industry. The last thing we need is someone who is diametrically opposed to natural medicine in a position of power, particularly concerning how our country deals with a virus against which natural medicines like zinc, potassium, and vitamin D have demonstrated efficacy. The record on Dr. Kessler is clear. In 1993, he took aim at the supplement industry by trying to limit the health claims supplements could make under the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990. This law gave the FDA the authority to approve disease-prevention claims for food, including supplements (for example, \"adequate calcium throughout life may reduce the risk of osteoporosis\")\u2014but Dr. Kessler said the FDA would not approve any of the proposed claims for supplements. He stood before Congress that same year and compared the supplement industry to \"snake oil salesmen.\"... Dr. Kessler also serves as board chair for the Center for Science in the Public Interest's (CSPI) Board of Directors. It is a fitting post for Dr. Kessler, as CSPI shares his negative views on dietary supplements. In particular, CSPI worked to eliminate legal structure/function claims for dietary supplements. (A structure/function claim describes the role of a nutrient on the structure or function of the body, such as \"calcium builds strong bones,\" or \"antioxidants maintain cell integrity.\") There is also speculation that Dr. Kessler is being considered for a more prominent role in government, such as heading up the Health and Human Services Department. Dr. Kessler's appointment to the COVID-19 task force is therefore particularly concerning. We are already dealing with federal agencies trying to gag doctors to prevent them from disseminating basic information about the benefits of supplements for COVID-19\u2014supplements that were part of President Trump's own treatment regimen. There is clear evidence to suggest many natural medicines to help prevent and treat COVID... To me, this shows foremost that the 'Alliance for Natural Health' is an irresponsible lobby group for SCAM that does not hesitate to put public health at risk in order to boost the already enormous profits of the SCAM industry. If these lobbyists are unhappy, it should be good news. Right now, Joe Biden has certainly other things on his mind than SCAM. But the appointment of Kessler is one of several indications that he intends to take much more of a pro-science, pro-public health course than his predecessor. The fact that the 'Alliance for Natural Health' is up in arms might be a sign that he is not likely to take SCAM fools lightly. Personally, I am relieved that Trump is gone and I wish the new administration and the American people only the very best. "}
