Market wrap: ASX slumps into weekend as COVID fears bite By Alex Druce The Australian sharemarket's seventh straight weekly rise finished under a cloud as a growing coronavirus cluster on Sydney's northern beaches threatened to ruin Christmas for holidaymakers and investors alike. The ASX 200 backed away from near 10-month highs on Friday as 10 additional virus cases were uncovered in the region - bringing the total to 28 - and prompting all other states and territories to implement border restrictions for travellers from the hot spot. The local benchmark dropped 81.2 points, or 1.2 per cent, to finish at 6675.5 as investors ignored a strong Wall Street lead and improved commodity prices and instead focused on the threat of wider lockdowns at the end of a shocking year. \"I'd say there is also a bit of pre-holiday profit-taking in there too, as we came off a strong session on Thursday,\" said Tribeca portfolio manager Jun Bei Liu. \"But it is the fears around the virus that has been the main factor. Anything that gained in the reopening trade has been sold off.\" The big banks, tech firms and property stocks suffered in the final session of the week, while travel-aligned companies and the energy sector predictably fell. Gold miners, health firms, and supermarkets Coles and Woolworths were in the winners' circle. The market had started the day at its highest since February 25, but followed up its best session of the month with its worst. The index did however manage to hold on to seal a seventh straight weekly rise - mainly due to Thursday's economic-fuelled ebullience - and continue a streak that began with a market-friendly US election result in November. The ASX 200 last rose for seven weeks in a row in April and May in 2016. There were plenty of declines across Friday's session but three particularly heavy losses. Stem cell firm Mesoblast plummeted 36 per cent to a near eight-month low of $2.41 on poor trial results for a COVID treatment. Dairy company a2 Milk dropped 23.6 per cent to $10.14 - its lowest in nearly two years - as it forecast a near half-a-billion dollar hit to revenue from its disrupted daigou network. QBE was the third heavy loss for the session. The insurer dropped 12.5 per cent to $12.85 after flagging a statutory full-year loss of $1.5 billion after US write-downs and a higher than expected impact of COVID-19 and extreme weather claims. Coronavirus fears send ASX 200 1.2% lower on Friday The Australian sharemarket backed away from near 10-month highs to finish Friday's session 81.2 points, or 1.2 per cent, lower at 6675.5. The expansion of the northern beaches coronavirus cluster in Sydney weighed on investor sentiment, as all other states and territories implemented border restrictions for travellers from the hot spot. The market still managed to finish 0.5 per cent higher for the week - its seventh straight weekly gain. The biggest movers on Friday were: Advertisement ASX down 1.1% as losses accelerate in late trade The week is drawing to a close, and the Australian sharemarket is down 1.1 per cent at a session low of 6683.3. A strong Wall Street lead and improved commodity prices were pushed aside this morning as investors waited nervously to see whether the northern beaches coronavirus cluster in Sydney had grown enough to warrant further lockdowns. Residents of the hot spot area have been advised to stay at home for three days after the cluster grew to 28 cases. Victoria will implement a permit system from midnight tonight for anyone arriving from NSW, including people who transit through Sydney airport. Anyone who has been to the northern beaches will be forced into 14 days of hotel quarantine. Victoria is also warning its citizens to avoid travel to NSW because they might close the border. All other states and territories have implemented border restrictions for travellers from the hotspot. WA has gone a step further by forcing all NSW travellers into 14-day quarantine. The market is still 0.6 per cent ahead for the week, in what would be its seventh straight weekly gain. 'The time is now' for Australia to harness new vaccine technology By Emma Koehn The resurgence of COVID-19 cases in Sydney is a salient reminder of how crucial a successful vaccine will be in paving a path to normality. The federal government has also ordered doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, which has shown efficacy of up to 95 per cent and has been the first coronavirus vaccine to launch into communities. However, there's no chance of that vaccine being produced in Australia for the time being. CSL has been quick to quell investor and media expectations that it can make the product onshore, citing the difficulties in preparing its facilities for the mRNA vaccine format. At the bank's annual general meeting on Friday, Mr Chronican said balance sheet strength was fundamental to surviving the economic turbulence as he faced questions about the dilution of shareholder value. \"In the face of a significant disruption from COVID19, we saw a need to strengthen the capital structure of the company and we chose a method which was the best available trade-off between speed and certainty and desire to be as fair to our shareholders as we possibly can be,\" Mr Chronican said. The bank's remuneration report passed with flying colours, attracting around 98 per cent shareholder approval, after chief executive Ross McEwan took a 20 per cent pay cut and froze bonus payments to his leadership team. This was the second consecutive year NAB's executives did not receive bonuses although Mr Chronican said this was unlikely to continue, citing talent retention concerns. NAB shares were 2 per cent lower at $23.39 at 2.45pm AEDT. Advertisement ASX heading for seventh week of gains despite virus jitters By Alex Druce The Australian sharemarket is tracking for a loss on Friday as coronavirus fears in Sydney sap investor appetites. However - barring a late disaster - the market is still set to record a seventh straight week of gains. The ASX 200 was down 0.8 per cent at 6700.8 at 2.15pm AEDT as the banks and insurers weighed, tech stocks sunk, and travel-aligned stocks copped a beating. But if the market manages to avoid a fall of 1.7 per cent it will finish the week higher and extend its streak to seven. This hasn't happened since April and May in 2016. Earlier, NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said 10 new cases of COVID-19 have been identified, linked with the outbreak in Northern Beaches. It brings the cluster to 28. Mesoblast and a2 Milk were down a whopping 30 per cent and 20 per cent respectively on negative news updates. Gold miners were higher and the iron ore giants also rose, while health stocks also eked out gains. US futures were in the red, pointing to losses on Wall Street tonight, while the Aussie dollar remained above 76 US cents. Rescue funds keep Geelong refinery afloat as losses spiral to $100m By Nick Toscano Viva Energy intends to keep the struggling Geelong oil refinery open beyond mid-2021 with the help of an emergency federal subsidy, offering hope for hundreds of workers as the plant's losses climb to nearly $100 million. The fate of the 65-year-old refinery and its 700 workers have been under threat as travel bans to arrest the spread of COVID-19 infections wiped out demand for fuel and gutted the plant's profit margins. Viva launched a strategic review assessing options including closing the refinery permanently but chief executive Scott Wyatt on Friday confirmed it intended to keep the refinery operating beyond the next six months. Mr Wyatt said Viva would participate in the Morrison government's fast-tracked industry subsidy program of an interim 1\u00a2-per-litre payment for locally made fuels, funded until June 30, when a longer-term $2.3 billion subsidy to support Australia's three remaining oil refineries is expected to take effect for the coming 10 years. Viva shares were down 6 per cent at $1.89 by 1.35pm AEDT. Daigou blow for a2 Milk as firm downgrades outlook By Dominic Powell Dairy company A2 Milk is set to weather a near half-a-billion dollar hit to its sales for the current financial year due to weaker-than-expected trade through the lucrative Chinese 'daigou' reseller market. The company, which has been in a trading halt since yesterday, told investors its sales into China through the channel had been significantly disrupted due to COVID-19, and the weakness had begun to affect its broader cross-border e-commerce (CBEC) business. Shares in the firm had fallen more than 24 per cent to $10.04 by 1.20pm AEDT. A2 has already downgraded its forecast once earlier this year after a drop in sales through the channel due to weaker student and tourist sales due to COVID-19, but on Friday the business warned the impact had been \"more significant and protracted than was previously anticipated\". \"We had expected a moderation of the disruption to this important channel during the second quarter,\" the company said. \"While there has been some improvement, with infant nutrition sales through this channel expected to be higher in the second quarter than the first quarter, the acceleration of the recovery in recent weeks has been slower than we had previously expected. \"This disruption is now affecting A2 Milk's CBEC channel, which imports and sells products directly into China, due to the daigou channel playing an important role in stimulating demand across the CBEC channel. The company now expects its revenue for the 2021 financial year to be between $1.4 billion and $1.55 billion, a $250 million to $500 million drop on its September guidance. Margins are also expected to be between 3 and 5 per cent weaker than prior forecasts. \"We expect that COVID-19 related travel restrictions will continue to negatively impact the reseller channel due to reduced travel between Australia and China through the remainder of FY21, with limited prospect of a return of a significant number of international students and tourists to Australia during the period,\" it said. Advertisement Victoria urges residents to avoid Sydney travel as new permit system announced By Matt Dennien and Melissa Cunningham Victorian Health Minister Martin Foley is urging Victorians not to travel to Sydney. From midnight tonight, a permit will be required for all NSW residents travelling into Victoria, residents from other states travelling through NSW and Victorians who have visited NSW and who are returning home. Nobody without a valid permit will be allowed into the state from NSW, with Victorian authorities urging those coming from NSW to avoid travelling to Melbourne if they can. Anyone trying to enter Victoria from the northern beaches and other NSW exposure sites from midnight tonight will not be permitted to enter Victoria at all. Anyone travelling from Greater Sydney, which has been deemed an orange zone, is encouraged to get tested on arrival and self quarantine until they receive a negative result. Those travelling from regional NSW, dubbed a green zone, will be asked to monitor themselves for mild symptoms Meanwhile, Queensland Chief Health Officer Jeannette Young says a woman who travelled from NSW before testing positive to COVID-19 visited a pub in Brisbane's south and drove to the Sunshine Coast before heading back to her home state. Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said she was closely monitoring the \"rapidly growing\" situation but announced no further restrictions on travel. Contact tracing is being carried out to alert anyone on Virgin flight VA925 from Sydney to Brisbane on Wednesday, December 16, and those who visited the Glen Hotel in Eight Mile Plains, in Brisbane's south, after 11.30am on the same day. Dr Young said the woman in her 50s then drove in a hire car to the Sunshine Coast but only had contact with a hotel receptionist, before getting tested at the Prince Charles Hospital on the way back through Brisbane to Sydney. \"This is a rapidly evolving situation in the northern beaches and could well expand through other parts of Sydney,\" Ms Palaszczuk said. Queensland recorded two other cases in hotel quarantine on Friday. "}
