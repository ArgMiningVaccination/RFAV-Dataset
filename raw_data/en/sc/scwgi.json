You can safely take homeopathic medicine with your regular medicines for blood pressure, thyroid, heart problems, diabetes, etc. There is no need for abruptly stopping your allopathic medicines when you begin your homeopathy treatment. Many patients do this to see if homeopathy is helping them. A doctor would be the best person to conduct this assessment; always consult one before making any changes in your existing allopathic treatment. "}
