Religion and physician-patient relationship. / Fam Proa 199235:201-208. Spirituality is an important aspect o f health care that is not often addressed in modern day medical practice.1 S piritu ality has been defined as having to do with \"the spirit or the soul, as distinguished from the body, what is often thought o f as the better or higher part o f the mind.\"2 Spirituality has to do with man's search for a sense o f meaning and purpose in life3'4; it is that part o f a person's psyche that strives for transcendental values, meaning, and experience.5 S pirit is that aspect or essence o f a person (soul) that gives him or her power and energy, and motivates the pursuit o f virtues such as love, truth, and wisdom.6 R elig ion , on the other hand, is \"any specific system o f belief, worship, conduct, etc, often involving a code o f ethics and a philosophy.\"2 It may include doctrine, dogma, metaphors, myths, and a way o f perceiving the world.7 Organized religion is one way o f expressing one's spirituality. Common to many religions are purity o f life, peace, and belief in immortality and a higher power.8 The wide variety o f religions attests to the importance o f spirituality to humans. This diversity makes it important for the physician to provide medical skills to both atheists S u bm itted, F ebru ary 11, 1992.

It is the authors' conviction that spirituality or reli\u00ad gion helps individual patients cope with illness (a psy\u00ad chosocial emotional imbalance), disease (a physical dis\u00ad order), and other stressful life events.4 The clergy may promote this process; hospital chaplains and community pastors who have had clinical pastoral education often assist in the healing process by being \"physicians o f the soul\" and are often called on to minister to the spiritual needs o f patients in hospitals and nursing homes.9 Phy\u00ad sicians can help their patients develop spiritual health. Most physicians neglect this component o f a patient's health, however, because o f personal discomfort with the subject, concern for imposing their own beliefs on pa\u00ad tients, or the belief that medicine is a science whereas spirituality is not.1 Foster and his colleagues1 0 have outlined five re\u00ad quirements for physicians to meet the spiritual needs o f their patients. In their view the physician must: (1) be trustworthy, (2) treat the patient as a person, (3) be kind, (4) maintain hope, and (5) assist the patient in determin\u00ad ing what it means to live. Historical Background Medicine originally developed in religious contexts.1 1 Sham ans were the therapists in preindustrial societies.1 2 continued on p ag e 205 The Journal of Family Practice, Vol. 35, No. 2, 1992 201 Spirituality and Medical Practice McKee and Chappel continued fro m p a g e 201 During the early Christian era, physicians were clergy members, and the church was the first to grant a medical license.11-1 3 Priests were custodians o f public health and were interested in the whole person.8 It was the devel\u00ad opment o f a scientific basis for medicine that made it necessary to separate it from religion. With the advent o f medical technology in the 20th century, medical practice has undergone great change that includes the acceptance o f a mechanistic-reductionist model with an emphasis on technology. This biomedical model has led to patients feeling alienated from their physicians' humanity. As medicine becomes more sub\u00ad specialized, it is at risk o f getting even farther away from care o f the whole patient. An attempt to expand the biomedical model was made by Engel in 1980.14 He described a patient with an acute myocardial infarction, emphasizing the importance o f recognizing and attending to psychosocial factors when providing medical care. Since that time there has been an explosion o f interest in psychosocial issues in medicine, and the biopsychosocial model has been widely taught in medical schools. In 1986, Hiatt1 5 proposed expanding the model to biopsychosocial-spiritual, as did Kuhn16 in 1988. They believed this model could help to unify the technical aspect o f medicine with such diverse matters as medical ethics and attitudinal influences in healing,1 5 that to be healthy involves the optimal func\u00ad tions o f body, mind, and spirit in whatever the social context.1 6 Literature Review Spirituality W ith in M edical Practice There is growing evidence that spiritual practices can complement medical treatments in cases o f both acute and chronic disease.13'1 7\"24 This concept would extend health to optimal functioning in physical, mental, social, and spiritual areas.25 There is increasing momentum to address spirituality in health care as evidenced by the increase in \" 12-stcp programs\" used by such groups as Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) for overcoming addictive behavior. These programs incorporate belief in a higher power as essential in the treatment plan. Holistic medi\u00ad cine, as discussed in Love, M edicin e, an d M iracles by Bernie Segal,26 and T he R o a d Less T raveled by M. Scott Peck,27 speaks to the exploding interest in the intersec\u00ad tion between medicine and spirituality. Nine religious ideas have been described that pro\u00ad vide an ethical foundation for medical practice. These include stewardship, creation, human dignity, freedom, love, covenant, justice, vocation, and finitude.28 A usefulhistorical paper1 1 describes medicine and religion inter\u00ad secting in four areas: (1) meanings o f health and illness; (2) relation o f health to other human values; (3) attitudes toward the aged, incurable, and w eak; and (4) attitudes toward nature. Religion serves to give hope in the face o f death1 4 and provides practical resources for coping with sickness, such as prayer, social support, and ritual actions aimed at forgiveness and healing.22 Koenig and colleagues have described family physi\u00ad cians who believe that religion has a positive effect on the mental and physical health o f elderly patients and that, if appropriate, religious values should be discussed with these patients. One Christian physicians' support group encourages members to pray for their patients, read scripture to them as a therapeutic modality, and encour\u00ad age patients to get in touch with and exercise their spirituality.2 1 Nurses trained in therapeutic touch have been able to decrease the pain, the emotional and spiri\u00ad tual fears, and the anxieties o f persons with AIDS, thereby restoring a sense o f balance to the patient.29 30 Some innovative teaching programs (eg, California's Loma Linda University) have integrated a spiritual di\u00ad mension into medical training by having the hospital clergy participate in medical rounds with residents. Effects o f Spiritual H ea lin g an d Prayer on Patients Cohen3 1 referred 44 patients to spiritual healers and found that 35 (80% ) felt better after the experience. He noted that these healers spent up to eight times longer with patients than the average family physician. The increased time, combined with touch in a safe environ\u00ad ment, counteracts fear, stress, and loneliness, all o f which retard healing. Vaillant,32 in three prospective studies, found that participation in Alcoholics Anonymous was significantly more effective than medical or psychological treatment in helping alcoholics achieve long-term sobri\u00ad ety. The original 12-stcp program encourages a personal experience with a \"higher power,\" which is compatible with all medical care and every religion. Prayer, a spiritual activity found in every religion, has been studied since the 19th century. A recent study23 randomly assigned 393 patients admitted to a coronary care unit cither to a group that received daily prayer or a group that did not. The project was fully explained to each patient, and informed consent was obtained regard\u00ad less o f the patient's religious affiliation or lack o f it. Evaluators, staff, and patients were blinded throughout the study. At admission there were no significant differ\u00ad ences between the two groups on cardiac and noncardiac diagnoses. At discharge the prayer group differed signif- The Journal of Family Practice, Vol. 35, No. 2, 1992 205 Spirituality and M edical PracticeMcKee and Chappel icantly on 6 o f 26 treatment and outcome variables. They required less ventilation assistance (P < .002), fewer antibiotics (P < .005), had fewer cardiopulmonary ar\u00ad rests (P < .02), fewer episodes o f congestive heart failure (P < .03) and pneumonia (P < .03), and required fewer diuretics (P < .05). Religion has also been shown to play a healing role in postabortion dysphoria.24 Effect o f Organized Religion on Community Health Studies o f particular religious groups have shown that health has been enhanced in certain areas. Mormons have a lower incidence o f cancer associated with smoking and lower rates o f cancer o f the breast, ovary, uterus, cervix, and prostate than die general population.33 Blood pres\u00ad sure was lower in religious immigrants than in nonrcli- gious ones, and lower in frequent churchgoers than in infrequent ones.34-35 Churchgoers were healthier in a variety o f areas as compared with those who attended church infrequently or not at all; these areas included mental health: there was decreased suicide and psychiat\u00ad ric morbidity among churchgoers. Many churches take an active role in providing health care to their congregations, specifically reaching out to the elderly.37 Churches and other religious orga\u00ad nizations can provide a lifelong support system that in\u00ad cludes prayer and psychological help provided within the context o f communal relationship.38 Some churches have provided places for hyperten\u00ad sion surveillance and other social and health programs. Others provide financial support for community pro\u00ad grams such as the Crisis Pregnancy Center, the Salvation Army, and Third World medical missions. Community problems identified by the clergy in one study included lack o f jobs, pregnancy in teenagers, gang crimes, hun\u00ad ger, and school dropouts.39 Cooperation between clergy and physicians has been emphasized. If this cooperation does not occur, the out\u00ad come o f medical care can be jeopardized through non- compliance with medicines, missed appointments, and therapy rejection.1 8 It is not necessary for the physician to share the patient's religious or spiritual beliefs.38 It is, however, important to understand and respect the pa\u00ad tient's belief system since such systems tend to be stable and resistant to change. Priests and ministers can enhance patient care in the following ways:38 (1) improve the patient's compliance with medication, (2) help the pa\u00ad tient cope with problems encountered in daily life, (3) encourage the patient to return to the physician for follow-up, (4) support family members, (5) provide the patient with opportunities to socialize through the activ\u00adities o f their religious institution, and (6) involve patients in rituals that provide structure and hope. Incorporating Spirituality into Medical Practice It is evident that there is a growing body o f medical literature suggesting that spirituality is o f interest and beneficial to the practice o f primary care medicine. How\u00ad ever, as in any other scientific endeavor, tools to measure the object in question are needed. Herein lies the prob\u00ad lem, since spirituality is not provable or quantifiable. Research to assess spiritual health or well-being is in its infancy. The most commonly used scale has 20 items combining existential and religious issues for an overall scale o f spiritual well-being.40 This instrument has the advantage o f being scorable. However, it does not ad\u00ad dress some o f the issues raised in Kuhn's Spiritual Inven\u00ad tory.16 The 25 questions in Kuhn's inventory are in\u00ad tended for clinical use by a physician, and not all have to be asked. The inventory describes a patient with spiritual health as one who (1) attaches meaning and purpose to life events, including the illness; (2) has hope, faith, and a relative absence o f guilt; (3) is able to love and forgive self and others, (4) participates in laughter and celebra\u00ad tion, and (5) is involved in a community o f faith and practicing worship, prayer, and meditation. We support and recommend the guidelines adopted by the American Psychiatric Association, which can be paraphrased as follows for all physicians:41 1. Physicians should maintain respect for their pa\u00ad tients' beliefs. It is useful for physicians to obtain infor\u00ad mation on the religious or ideologic orientation and beliefs o f their patients so that they may properly attend to them in the course o f treatment. If an unexpected conflict arises in relation to such beliefs, it should be handled with a concern for the patient's vulnerability to the attitudes o f the physician. Empathy for the patient's sensibilities and particular beliefs is essential. 2. Physicians should not impose their own religious, antircligious, or ideologic systems o f beliefs on their patients, nor should they substitute such beliefs or rituals for accepted diagnostic concepts or therapeutic practice. Studies on faith healing suggest that this practice does not need to be in competition with medical treat\u00ad ment. The results are often enhancements o f the patient's subjective well-being and changes in the patient's lifestyle rather than changes in the disease process. As such, these results are o f value to physicians.42'43 continued on p ag e 2 0 8 206 The Journal of Family Practice, Vol. 35, No. 2, 1992 Spirituality and Medical PracticeMcKee and Chappel continued fro m p a g e 206 Conclusions It is important for primary care providers, trained to consider the whole family and person, to take into ac\u00ad count their patient's spiritual health. The physician need not share the patient's beliefs, but must understand and respect them in order for treatment to be effective. Fam\u00ad ily physicians are adept at physical diagnosis and treat\u00ad ment, and to a lesser extent, psychosocial intervention, but they are usually ignorant o f the spiritual component o f illness.44 The family physician cannot choose whether to acknowledge religious variables in practice; they exist, whether recognized or not.17 Reiser and Rosen44 have expressed concern over \"contemporary medicine's lack of appreciation for the human spirit. [Physicians] should realize how important spiritual concerns are for many of their patients, and how abysmally neglected they have been in the prevailing ethos o f contemporary medicine.\" Spiritual issues can be raised by the physician and arc potentially useful in promoting a patient's sense o f well-being and response to treatment. This is an area that can be researched and included in medical education. References 1. Chandy J. Faith, hope, and love in medicine. Pharos 1988; Fall: 12-7. 2.
