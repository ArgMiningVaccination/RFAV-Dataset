We will contact you shortly if your message requires a response. Acupuncture is the traditional Chinese medicine of inserting thin metal needles into various areas of the body, stimulating key anatomical points. It can be used to aid sedation, manage pain, supplement surgical procedures, or it can be a therapy on its own. By offering our pet patients acupuncture therapy, we aim to release toxins through an alternative, non-medicated method of healing and rehabilitation. If you are interested in acupuncture for your pet, contact our office today. Acupuncture can serve as a therapy for the following disorders: - Cardiovascular (cardiomyopathy, etc) - Dermatological (allergic dermatitis, chronic skin disease, etc) - Gastrointestinal (inflammatory bowel disease, liver disease, etc) - Musculoskeletal (arthritis, hip dysplasia, etc) - Neurological (epilepsy, paralysis, etc) - Respiratory (asthma, chronic coughing, etc) - Urological (kidney disease, incontinence, etc) Is acupuncture safe and will it cause my pet pain? Acupuncture is one of the oldest, most safe forms of therapy still utilized today. When pet acupuncture is performed by a trained therapist, its implementation can help heal pets with side effects being rare and minimal. Most pet owners assume that because acupuncture utilizes needles, it must be painful. In reality, the needles are only noticed by the patient for a quick second when they are first inserted. The initial insertion of the needle is slightly less painful than a vaccination or injection and is followed by a numb tingling. Once the body begins to feel numb and tingly, most patients completely relax or fall asleep. How long is an acupuncture session? The length of each acupuncture session depends upon the issue being treated and the amount of needles that need to be inserted. After insertion, each singular needle must be stimulated in order for the pet to receive full benefit from the therapy; this stimulation can last anywhere from 15 seconds to a full 30 minutes. How frequently does my pet need acupuncture? The scheduling and frequency of acupuncture treatments will vary between patients. At your first appointment, the veterinarian will discuss a unique schedule for your individual pet. In some cases, one acupuncture therapy session is all that is required. However, most patients usually receive 1 to 3 treatments per week for a period of 4 to 6 weeks. After the patient begins responding to treatment, the regularity of sessions is gradually lessened until treatment is only necessary 2 to 4 times per year.
