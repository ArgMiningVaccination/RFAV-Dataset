Naturopaths regularly appear in the media as subject matter experts, write articles for professional journals. Naturopaths also work in natural product companies formulating new products, conducting literature research, performing technical writing and providing product support. Naturopaths can also pursue post graduate study. Laboratory, clinical and public health areas of research including investigations of plants, effectiveness and safety of naturopathy and the impact of naturopathy on public health are popular areas of interest.
