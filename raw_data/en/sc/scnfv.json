We'll tell you what the research says, as well as some tips for preventing indigestion in the first place.", "sitename": "BetterMe Blog", "date": "2022-05-25", "cleaned_text": "Indigestion, or dyspepsia, is a general term for discomfort, pain or burning in the stomach or upper abdomen. This common problem can be caused by a variety of conditions. Some people experience indigestion when they eat certain foods or drinks. Others have this problem all the time. There are many over-the-counter and prescription medications available to treat indigestion, yet some people prefer to use home remedies. One popular remedy is baking soda, or sodium bicarbonate. This compound can neutralize stomach acid and ease indigestion. Let's take a closer look at how baking soda may help relieve indigestion and explore other natural options. What Is Baking Soda? Baking soda is a white powder that is commonly used as a leavening agent in baking. It's also known as sodium bicarbonate or bicarbonate of soda. Baking soda is a [basic compound](https://betterme.world/articles/no-processed-food-diet-menu/). This means it has a pH greater than 7. When it's added to an acidic compound, it neutralizes the acid and increases the pH. For this reason, it is often used as an antacid to treat heartburn and indigestion. It's also used to relieve stomach discomfort caused by indigestion or an upset stomach ( [1](https://badgut.org/information-centre/a-z-digestive-topics/baking-soda-for-heartburn/)). How Does Baking Soda Work? When stomach acid refluxes or backs up into the esophagus, it causes a lot of [discomfort](https://betterme.world/articles/microbiome-diet-shopping-list/). It happens when the valve between the stomach and esophagus doesn't work properly. When acid reflux becomes chronic, it's known as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) ( [5](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gerd/symptoms-causes/syc-20361940)). Symptoms of acid reflux and GERD include ( [5](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gerd/symptoms-causes/syc-20361940)): - Heartburn - a burning sensation in the chest - Regurgitation - a feeling of food or liquid coming up into the throat or mouth - Sore throat - Coughing - Difficulty swallowing - Chest pain - Bad breath The most common symptom of GERD is heartburn. This is a burning sensation that starts in the lower part of the chest and may spread to the throat ( [5](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gerd/symptoms-causes/syc-20361940)). Acid reflux and GERD are often treated with antacids. These medications neutralize stomach acids and relieve symptoms ( [5](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gerd/symptoms-causes/syc-20361940)). Baking soda is thought to work by immediately neutralizing stomach acid. This gives the esophagus time to heal and prevents further damage to the digestive system ( [1](https://badgut.org/information-centre/a-z-digestive-topics/baking-soda-for-heartburn/)). Baking soda is generally considered safe and effective for occasional use. However, it's not recommended as a long-term solution since it can be harmful if used too often ( [1](https://badgut.org/information-centre/a-z-digestive-topics/baking-soda-for-heartburn/)). It also doesn't work for all kinds of heartburn or indigestion. Be sure to talk to your doctor about whether it's safe for you and if you find you need it more than just occasionally, discuss a different solution with your doctor.

However, there are some potential side effects to be aware of. When taken in large amounts, baking soda can be toxic ( [11](https://www.drugs.com/sfx/sodium-bicarbonate-side-effects.html)). The recommended dosage for adults is \u00bc to 1/2 teaspoon dissolved in \u00bd cup (4 oz or 125 ml) ounces of water ( [1](https://badgut.org/information-centre/a-z-digestive-topics/baking-soda-for-heartburn/)). Don't take it within 2 hours of any medications as it can affect how your body absorbs them or the way they work. Baking soda should not be given to children under the age of six years old unless your doctor tells you to. Baking soda can cause gas and bloating. It can also cause stomach cramps and an increase in stool volume ( [11](https://www.drugs.com/sfx/sodium-bicarbonate-side-effects.html)). If you experience these side effects, stop taking baking soda and see your doctor. When used as directed, baking soda is generally safe for [most people](https://betterme.world/articles/7-day-anemia-diet-plan/).

How To Prevent Indigestion Prevention is always better than cure. There are many things you can do to help prevent indigestion, such as: Eating Smaller Meals Large meals can cause indigestion, especially if you eat them quickly. This is because your stomach can't digest a lot of food at once. Try to eat smaller meals more often during the day. Chewing Food Thoroughly Indigestion can sometimes be caused by not chewing your food properly. Take your time when you're eating and chew each bite slowly and thoroughly. Avoiding Trigger Foods There are certain foods that can trigger indigestion in some people. Common trigger foods include spicy food, fatty food, and chocolate. If you notice that certain foods make your indigestion worse, try to avoid them. Avoiding Acidic Foods Acidic foods can also sometimes trigger indigestion. This includes citrus fruits, tomatoes, and vinegar. If you're prone to indigestion, try to avoid these foods if they seem to make your indigestion worse. Lying Down After Eating Your stomach needs to be in an upright position to properly digest food. That's why lying down or taking a nap shortly after eating can make indigestion worse. Staying upright for at least an hour after eating can help prevent indigestion. Taking a short walk after a meal can be even better. Not Wearing Tight Clothes Wearing tight clothing can put pressure on your stomach and make indigestion worse. Try to wear loose, comfortable clothing if you're prone to indigestion. Managing Stress Stress can make indigestion worse. The connection between stress and indigestion is not fully understood, but it's thought that stress may increase the production of stomach acid ( [13](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3576549/)). There are many different ways to manage stress, such as exercise, relaxation techniques, and counseling. Making Some Lifestyle Changes Making some lifestyle changes can also help prevent indigestion. If you smoke, for example, you're more likely to experience indigestion. Quitting smoking can help reduce the risk of indigestion ( [13](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3576549/)). Excess weight can also contribute to indigestion. Losing weight if you're overweight or obese may help prevent or relieve symptoms. If you drink alcohol, try to limit your intake. Drinking too much alcohol can irritate your stomach and lead to indigestion. The same applies to caffeinated beverages such as coffee, tea, and soda.
