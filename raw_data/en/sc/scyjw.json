Text of survey instrument A Global Survey on National Policy on Traditional/Complementary/Alternative Medicine & Regulation of Herbal Medicines Date: Country: Investigator: Title of Investigator: Address: Telephone: Fax: E-mail: National policy on traditional medicine and regulation of herbal medicines Report of a WHO global survey 144Introduction With the widespread use of traditional medicine (TM) as well as complementary/alternative medicine (CAM) and the rapid expansion of international herbal medicine markets, the development of national policies and regulations on TM/CAM has become an important concern for both health authorities and the public. Providers of TM/CAM, other health care professionals and TM/CAM consumers alike are calling for regulations that can ensure the safety of TM/CAM therapies and products, promote recognition of these systems and modalities and further define their role in modern health care systems TP1 PT. National policies and regulations on TM/CAM could ensure the safety, quality and efficacy of these therapies and products, and function as important steps towards integrative health-care systems. However, relatively few countries have developed policies and regulations on TM/CAM so far. Only 25 of WHO's 191 countries have a national policy on TM/CAM and only 64 countries regulate herbal medicines TP2 PT. To assist countries in the development of TM/CAM policies and regulations of herbal medicines, WHO has published a series of technical guidelines and reviewed regulations on herbal medicines in the document \"Regulatory Situation of Herbal Medicines: a Worldwide Review\", published in 1998. With this survey, WHO is taking one step further towards an increased understanding of TM/CAM policies and regulations of herbal medicines in the countries. By using a common approach in the measurement of the regulatory situation in all countries, a comparative analysis of the results will be feasible and major themes and obstacles can be identified. In order to provide continuous valuable support in the future, WHO is also requesting the countries to define their assistance needs. This survey is based on 21 structural indicators of qualitative and quantitative nature, which are intended to assess the situation of TM/CAM policies and herbal medicine regulation. Analysis of the survey results will provide the basis for further development of a comprehensive set of indicators including background and process indicators for the monitoring of national TM/CAM policies and herbal medicines regulation. Objectives The objectives of this survey are: \u0083To collect updated and comprehensive information on TM/CAM policies and regulations of herbal medicine in countries. \u0083To identify the specific needs of each Member State regarding capacity building on TM/CAM policies and regulation of herbal medicines, which will enable WHO to accordingly provide appropriate support to the countries. \u0083To update the document \"Regulatory Situation of Herbal Medicines: a Worldwide Review\". \u0083To monitor the impact of the WHO Strategy for Traditional Medicine in relation to present national policy and regulation on TM/CAM/herbal medicines. The indicators used in this document were de veloped by the Traditional Medicine/Department of Essential Drug and Medicine Policy in cooperation with the Division of International Health (IHCAR), Department of Public Health at Karolinska Institutet, Medicine (TM/CAM) Useful explanations: Traditio nal Medicine (TM): TM is the sum total of the knowledge, skills, and practices based on the theories, beliefs and experiences indigenous to different cultures, whether explicable or not, used in the maintenance of health as well as in prevention, diagnosis, improvement or treatment of physical and mental illnesses. Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM): The term CAM often refers to a broad set of health-care practices that are not part of a country's own tradition and are not integrated into the dominant health-care system.Other terms sometimes used to describe 'non-conventional medicine' guidelines for methodologies on rese arch and evaluation of traditional medicine , WHO/EDM/TRM/2000.1. Policy Useful explanations: National policy on TM/CAM: A national policy on TM/CAM could include some of the following key elements: a definition of TM/CAM, provision for the creationof laws and regulations, consideration of intellectual property issues, etc. The policy could further contain main strategies proposed by the government for achieving the objectives of the policy.

Many activities in the field ofTM/CAM could be covered by regulations, such as a description of obligations and responsibilities of licensed practitioners, the penal sanctions if these are not respected, the obligation of manufacturers of TM/CAM products, etc. Source: Indicators for monitoring national drug policies, 2nd ed., WHO/EDM/PAR/99.3. 2.
