The main goal of functional medicine lies in addressing the root cause of a disease by assessing a patient's biochemical individuality and implementing an integrative, personalized treatment plan. At [Aequa Health & Wellness](https://aequahealthandwellness.com/), we believe in transforming the future of medicine, one patient at a time. What Makes It Different? Functional medicine allows patients to take an active role in their health and wellbeing. Unlike conventional medicine, which has become a disease-oriented, doctor-centric field, functional medicine utilizes a health-oriented, patient-centered approach. A functional medicine doctor will draw a link between genetics, lifestyle, and environmental factors to diagnose chronic diseases that affect patients. Functional medicine practitioners prescribe natural treatments for their patients to help them heal. Our doctors also help patients adopt lifestyle changes that will boost their health in the long run. The main principles of functional medicine include: - Identification of the root cause of a disease - Biology-based approach - The uniqueness of each patient - Custom medical plans - Treat the patient and not the disease - Resolve health problems with natural solutions Functional Medicine vs. Integrative Medicine Practitioners of integrative medicine and functional medicine both spend extra time with patients, listen to their needs, and thoroughly review their medical histories before providing natural health solutions. Both disciplines take a holistic approach to healthcare. Although they may share many similarities, their differences provide patients with extra healthcare options. Functional Medicine The functional medicine model follows a science-based methodology. It concentrates on the management and prevention of the root cause of all chronic diseases. A functional medicine physician will gather information on a patient's wellbeing by identifying stressors, hereditary issues, and even spiritual health. Integrative Medicine Integrative medicine places a spotlight on lifestyle habits to understand the alterable factors that influence the wellbeing of a patient. The integrative medicine physician will encourage patients to pay attention to their food and exercise habits. Practitioners of integrative medicine will also help patients develop skills and behaviors that improve self-care, which they can then rely on for the rest of their lives. Acupuncture, yoga, and massage all serve as valid treatment therapies within integrative medicine. How to Find the Right Functional Medicine Doctor in St. Louis?
