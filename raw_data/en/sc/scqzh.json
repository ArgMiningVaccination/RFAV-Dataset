Wolf, OMC", "sitename": null, "date": "2010-01-01", "cleaned_text": "My interest in healing began years ago when acupuncture was first brought to this country. I was fascinated at how the skillful placement of needles into the body could bring about dramatic changes. Acupuncture lead me to chiropractic school, and having graduated in 1987, I practiced chiropractic for about 15 years. During my time in chiropractic, I was introduced to a number of wonderful teachers and healers. Among them were Dr. Donald Epstein, D.C., and Dr. Robert Ibrahim Jaffe, M.D. It was the influence of these two men in particular that changed the focus of my model of healing to the \"exploration\" of consciousness, and to revealing the Truth of All That Is which resides within the human heart. More recently, I have studied with Master Chunyi Lin, a Master of Qigong, and a selfless healer and teacher. Master Lin lives by example, that healing comes by way of unconditional love, kindness, and forgiveness, fueled by compassion. In 2008, I was fortunate to be in his first Level I teacher certification class. Meeting Dr. Richard Bartlett, D.C. , and having the opportunity to experience and utiilze his work, Matrix Energetics, has also been life changing. He also embodies the teachings of the previous mentioned three - within the human heart can be found all the wisdom of the Universe. The teachings of Eckhart Tolle, A Course In Miracles, Adyashanti, Jesus, the Buddha, and Siddha Yoga have all been invaluable in coming to an understanding of the way of Love, Compassion, and Allowing. I am also grateful to my tiospaye, all my beloveds whom I have prayed with in the sacred sweat lodge. You have been many, and I am thankful for those I continue to meet and pray with in this way. Within the last few years, I have completed a program with Pathways of Light Spiritual College, leading to an ordination as a Ministerial Counselor. This is an extremely rewarding program, which is one of self discovery and healing. Based on the teachings of A Course In Miracles, this program has also had a profound influence on my work. My inner guidance lead me in a direction that would eventually take me out of the practice of chiropractic, and solely focus on energy and spiritual healing. This has been extremely rewarding, as it offers those that I work with an opportunity to rediscover who they truly are, as well as experience more balance in their life physically, emotionally, and spiritually. Having grown up on a farm in central Illinois, I have lived in Estes Park, CO for 28 years. "}
