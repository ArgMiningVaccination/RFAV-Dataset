We accomplish this by using current and emerging knowledge of health, well-being, and human development to guide responsive, high-quality clinical, prevention, and population- based solutions to college health issues, and by promoting the perspective of health and well-being in University life. MissionSTRATEGIC INITIATIVE BIENNIAL REPORT 2018-195 I'm pleased to present the 2018-19 Biennial Report of University Health Services (UHS) . This report outlines a selection of our initiatives, our accomplishments, and the inspired work performed by UHS in conjunction with campus partners. We at UHS continually ask ourselves, \"What health and well-being-related knowledge, skills, and creative outlooks do we want every student who graduates to possess?\" Our struggle to respond to such questions is represented, in part, by the achievements presented in this report. A privilege of working in higher education is playing a facilitating role in students' growth, from arrival on campus to graduation. Yet our students' intellectual growth is only one part of our mission. Deep learning demands more, extending into personal, social, emotional, and identity realms. Our perspective is therefore a holistic one. Today, college health programs like ours are informed by an increasingly sophisticated understanding of health, development, and learning. At a time when students are forming patterns of adult health that will shape their lives, we have many opportunities to intervene and influence habits of well-being. Just as academic excellence is synonymous with Princeton, we would like \"well-being\" to enter the lexicon of the Princeton experience. Why focus on well-being? Promoting well-being enables people to realize their potential, cope with the stresses of life, study and work produc - tively, and connect meaningfully with others. Cultivating well-being is a skill that can be practiced and learned. The contemplative sciences, meditation, mindful practices, stress reduction, growth mindsets, self-affirmations, emotional reappraisal, and building resilience improve health, ameliorate threats to identity, and support learning. These approaches represent areas of ongoing and future growth at Princeton. Exciting work is underway to design a new health center. And last year, we launched Tiger - Well, a five-year Campus Life initiative supported by the Elcan Family Fund for Wellness Innovation. TigerWell enables Princeton to coordinate existing well-being efforts and create new opportunities for students and other members of the Princeton community to live their best lives. Demands on health programs (and on our campus partners) are increasingly complex. One is hard pressed to find a recent piece in academic or popular writing that does not use the word crisis to describe the current state of student mental health, note increases in students with serious medical problems, or describe resulting inequities in educational attainment. While Princeton's student body is more richly diverse than ever, our students confront difference in ways and at levels often new to them. Because of differences, some students face significant challenges adapting to our setting. A diverse campus is in the vital interest of our community. Our students might not share common definitions of health and health care, and some may mistrust health care settings as a result of negative experiences with health professionals or systems. For students of different backgrounds to thrive on Princeton's campus, culturally informed health care is essential and UHS prioritizes organizational learning in this critical area. A Message from the Executive Director6MESSAGE FROM THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR We are vigilant in tracking advances in health care. Our understanding of the stresses and strains of this generation of young people is ever evolving. Students' physical and mental health problems are being identified with greater precision and earlier, well before many students arrive at college or graduate school. Early identification combined with more effective treatments enables many to succeed in higher education who would otherwise be unable to do so. There is increased awareness and advocacy around mental health concerns at Princeton, leading to some diminished stigma and a willingness for students to overcome inhibitions and seek care. We take special pride in supporting these students' courageous efforts. All colleges and universities are grappling with these challenges. When considering strate - gies to strengthen student well-being across Princeton, we must keep in mind our own institutional landscape. For our relatively small size we are an unusually complex university, supporting a wide variety of student populations and offering a diverse array of academic programs in an intense climate of tradition, exploration, and discovery. And our students are not strangers to complexity and rapid change; our increasingly distracted, networked society thrusts change upon them. We must do all we can to enable students to secure the care they need to live safely and identify the connections they need to learn deeply. As leaders, we know that good ideas and thoughtful strategy mean little without a founda - tion of trust and an empathic approach. More than ever, we must work together across traditional boundaries and share governance in ways that do not merely influence but even inspire. Programs that foster student well-being require compassionate underpinnings, strong partnerships, and an innovative edge \u2014 along with the temerity to continually question the status quo and what may be currently considered best practices. The work that lies ahead will challenge us and require a generous appetite for change and experimentation \u2014 nothing new in our long history. We will continue to invest in our people, add or build new capacity where we have gaps and bottlenecks, and reduce impediments to innovation. I welcome your thoughts about, and engagement with, the information contained in this report. It is a portal into the ways in which we play our part to secure the promise that University life holds for Princeton's community, while on campus and long after. 7 BIENNIAL REPORT 2018-19 A fully accredited facility, UHS provides responsive, high-quality clinical, preventive, and consul - tative services to Princeton University undergraduate and graduate students and their dependents, as well as specialized services to faculty and staff. UHS contributes to Princeton's larger purpose by assuring a level of health and well-being that supports every student's potential and attainment of educational goals. An integrated, evidence-informed care model guides all UHS practices and services. These services are comprehensive and accessible. Using research-informed strategies, UHS leverages clinical encounters and prevention efforts to promote lifelong health and well-being among students and others in the Princeton community. We collaborate with many departments across campus and participate in regional and national initiatives related to emerging best practices in college health.

Such adjustments require agility and commitment. Achieving this level of organizational agility involves self-studies and environmental scans: continual assessments of health care trends; essential functions; students' health status, preferences, and needs; and alignment among the health program, departmental units, campus partners, and the University's priorities. Effective collaborations and organizational learning require a shared sense of purpose, good communication, and a positive interpersonal climate. Although UHS excels in many areas, sustaining excellence is challenging. A rapidly changing world requires the capacity to navigate the press of immediate day-to-day demands and the willingness to suspend overreliance on tactical approaches to decision-making. A strategic perspective is essential and UHS embraces this point of view. This current planning effort builds on the work of UHS' second Strategic Initiative v2.0 (SIv2), which covered the period 2015 through 2018. Calendar 2019 was a planning year for our next effort, Strategic Initiative v3.0 (SIv3). From Strategic Initiative v2.0 (2015 to 2018) to Strategic Initiative v3.0 (2020 to 2024) Although UHS operates within a terrain common to many college and university health services, it is committed to forging its own unique path, pursuing its particular ambitions, and building on the University's strengths. UHS' planning considers and seeks alignment with the Campus Life Division's direction and the University's priorities. Both the Office for the Vice President for Campus Life and the University's senior leadership have completed strategic planning efforts. UHS' strategic effort responded to the direction and implications of these other strategic plans. Strategic Initiative v3.0 retains the mission statement developed for SIv1 and SIv2, offers a sharpened vision statement articulating UHS' aspirations and projecting what UHS could look like in 2024, and adjusts UHS' value statements, which are consistent with insights gained during implementation of SIv2 and planning for SIv3. Details regarding UHS vision, values, and pillars can be found at the end of this report. UHS identified three goal areas for SIv3: (1) Prioritize health and well-being University-wide, (2) Build an exceptional workplace climate, and (3) Advance a quality mindset. Together these goals set Princeton on a path to be a true health-promoting University. Strategic Planning Toward Improvement Capability Case Study This past year we applied a quality and performance lens to our strategic planning process. We approached our setting's strategic planning efforts as a case study in \"Strategic Planning Toward Improvement Capability,\" revealing how quality improvement emerged as a key organizational Strategic Initiative v 3.0, 2020 to 2024change agent. We reviewed the three goals of SIv2 (quality, culture, and mission-focused learning), assessing each with respect to its impact on improvement capability and engagement. Our plan - ning process, which married strategy and measurement within a context of quality frameworks, had the desired impact of building improvement capability and staff engagement. This project was presented as a storyboard session at the 25th Annual Scientific Symposium on Improving the Quality and Value of Healthcare. Goal 1 Toward a Health-Promoting University: Support the University in Elevating Health and Well-being as a Priority This goal supports Princeton's efforts to become a health-promoting University, one in which health and well-being are elevated and embraced as an institutional priority. University life offers enormous potential to promote health and generate capacity and capability for future well-being. Creating a health-promoting Princeton means infusing a focus on well-being into the culture, organization, and priorities of the University \u2014 into planning conversations, built environments, policies and prac - tices, learning environments, everyday operations, and other mission-critical practices. The profile of health and well-being as an institutional priority is raised, and woven into as many aspects of teaching and learning as possible, inside and outside the classroom. Health and well-being, defined on an institutional scale, are not the responsibility just of UHS or the Office of the Vice President for Campus Life. What is required is shared responsibility across the institution for embedding explicit attention to well-being into all aspects of University life. Informed by the Okanagan Charter , an international call to action for health-promoting colleges and universities, this goal uses several initiatives as platforms for supporting the University in making health an institutional priority. 11 BIENNIAL REPORT 2018-19 12STRATEGIC INITIATIVE, V3.0 Thank you for all that you do and for how wonderfully you do it. Thank you for your kindness, your organizational prowess and your general you-ness. \u2014From a student to a Health Promotion Specialist Goal 2 Workplace Excellence: Build an Exceptional Workplace Climate in Which Staff Thrive and Advance Our Capacities to Serve This goal recognizes that the quality and effectiveness of our work are rooted in creating conditions for an exceptional workforce to thrive. Doing this requires fully engaging staff members, as unique individuals and as part of a larger collaborative enterprise, to care for our increasingly diverse student body and for the University employees who depend on us for care. The goal underscores the central importance of valuing members of the UHS workforce, which means committing to their engagement, organizational well-being, and learning. Engagement prospers from meaningful work, opportunities to learn and collaborate, knowledge sharing, intelligent risk-taking in the service of innovation, understanding of \"team science,\" and a system of accountability for performance. Organizational well-being relates to all aspects of working life, from the quality and safety of the physical environment and support in the workplace to how staff feel about their work and see their place in the organization's priorities, direction, and climate. There are reciprocal gains here, with well-being and workplace \"joy\" bolstering staff, which enhances care delivery. Organizational well- being also requires that leaders commit to ensuring that people have the tools and resources at their disposal to perform at their peak. Thriving in an organization also requires cultural inclusive - ness and respect \u2014 a work environment that educates, welcomes, and capitalizes on the diverse backgrounds, characteristics, knowledge, skills, creativity, and motivations of its members. Inclu - siveness depends upon a workplace that is experienced as fair, equitable, and supporting a sense of belonging. Reciprocally, our workplace advances learning and skill development in the delivery of culturally informed health care.BIENNIAL DomainGallup DATABASE RANKGallup Employee Engagement Goal 3 A Quality First Approach: Enhance Health and Well-being through Quality Improvement and Support of the \"Triple Aim\" Framework This goal recognizes and responds to the essential role of quality improvement (QI) and learning cycles in delivering health care and supporting students' health, well-being, and success. The quality first goal prioritizes a patient- and client-centered, evidence-informed, and culturally conscious approach to measuring, addressing, and improving all elements of quality, and doing so as a core organizational function. The goal therefore builds on and expands the foundational work done in this area through SIv2, which embedded QI and a culture of continuous improvement into our organiza - tional DNA. The evolution of this goal includes adoption of the \"Triple Aim,\" a framework developed by the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI). Pursuit of the Triple Aim \u2014 improved care, improved health, and greater value \u2014 and the translation of those aspirations to a university setting promise to strengthen quality improvement capabilities both across UHS and throughout college health more widely. A commitment to improvement at all systemic levels, the Triple Aim framework can serve as a road map for action. Pursuing the Triple Aim at UHS positions the University to achieve better care, better health, and increased value in support of student well-being, learning, and success, all in alignment with the University's guiding mission and purpose. The Triple Aim sets UHS on a pathway to Baldrige quality recognition.14 UHS Highlights Value Proposition The design and construction of a new health center for the University, will build on the University's objectives, now and into the future to advance a culture of wellbeing among Princeton students and support our students' efforts to become the best versions of themselves. Through a cost-effective building and landscape, the project aspires to promote physical and mental health and support interpersonal connection and wellbeing for our students. This space will be designed to be humanity-centered and healing in character. 15 BIENNIAL REPORT 2018-19 Designing a New Health Center The 2026 Princeton University Campus Plan proposed the creation of a new UHS facility on the north side of Goheen Walk, in the heart of campus, and we are happy to report that planning is now underway! A generous gift from the Frist family that supports a state-of-the-field university health center for the 21st century is enabling us to reenvision health and well-being at Princeton. The new facility will be strategically located to take advantage of proximities to campus life, including academic and residential facilities. Vehicular access from Washington Road will facilitate emer - gency vehicle access. The design and construction of the new health center for the University will build on the University's objectives to advance a culture of health and well-being among Princeton students. The project aspires to promote physical and mental health, interpersonal connection, and well-being for our students. This space will be designed to be humanity-centered and healing in character. Health will truly be in the woodwork as well as in the air: the building's architecture will inspire vigor and cultivate habits of well-being that last a lifetime. During FY19, the University's Office of Capital Projects and a design firm, WRNS Studio, have been UHS' primary partners in this unprec - edented design opportunity. The design calls for approximately 70,000 square feet on four floors, with an additional stand-alone pavilion contiguous to the main building. Eno Hall, already located on the designated site, will be renovated and incorporated into the design to create juxtapo - sition of old and new. The building will incorpo - rate sustainable features such as a mass timber structure. Mass timber has established benefits for health and wellness such as reduced stress, improved focus, and reduced pain perception among building occupants. The new health center will be completed in several years and serve as a living tribute to the University's commitment to health and well-being.TigerWell Princeton University and University Health Services have long sought innovative approaches to student health and well-being. In FY18, a gift from the Elcan family (\"The Elcan Family Fund for Wellness Innovation\") enabled the creation of TigerWell \u2014 a collaborative, whole-campus health and well-being initiative that coordinates existing resources with creative new approaches. Tiger - Well engages campus partners in promoting well- being through skills-building, outreach, events, professional development of staff and faculty, and program assessment and evaluation. The program goals of TigerWell include: fostering an institutional environment that promotes well-being for all members; increasing collaboration and alignment across campus partners in health and well-being promotion efforts; increasing students' social connectedness; promoting equity in health and well-being for all campus community members; increasing students' engagement, meaning, and purpose; expanding student access to mental health supports and related offerings; increasing the extent to which well-being promotion efforts at Princeton are informed by data; and increasing students' skills, behaviors, and mindsets to enhance positive coping and resilience. FY19 saw the hiring and onboarding of three full-time staff for TigerWell, including two outreach psychologists based out of Counseling and Psychological Services and a project manager based out of Health Promotion and Prevention Services (HPPS). The TigerWell team, consisting of these staff and the director of HPPS, works in conjunction with campus partners to bring the vision for this initiative to reality. In FY19, the Tiger - Well outreach psychologists, working from satellite offices across campus, provided more than 500 individual \"drop-in\" counseling appointments and more than 60 outreach programs, events, and consultations. The TigerWell project manager also engaged in over 40 consultations with campus partners to advance processes for partnership, professional development, research, and student 135 memb ers of TigerWell Campus Wellbeing Partnership 34 grants for wellbeing efforts funded by Tigerwell $52,000 Fund s dist ributed by Tigerwell wellbeing grants16UHS HIGHLIGHTS BIENNIAL REPORT 2018-1917Individual Level Group Level Institutional LevelSocietal Level Short-term counseling, advocacy, crisis intervention and support Community Integrity Program Referrals for long-term support/services Online educational programs (Not Anymore, Clarifying Consent) Awareness Programming MAVRIC Umatter/Respect MattersExternal consultant services and committee work Knowledge dissemination via external publications and presentations Legislative aairs for the state and federal governmentInternal consultation services for University Collaborative partnerships Policy advocacySHARE Peer Program (education, awareness, support, and referrals) for student groups Consultant services for students/student groups Skills-based intersectional and prevention-focused education for student groups, teams and departments Customized educational programsskills-building. FY19 also saw the establishment of the Campus Well-being Partnership, a convening of over 135 staff and faculty for sharing information and resources, collaboration and avoiding duplica - tion of efforts, and strategizing for meeting shared well-being goals. Finally, in FY19 TigerWell awarded 34 grants to a wide variety of campus partners to support well-being programming and projects. CPS Introduces Initial Consultations CPS introduced Initial Consultation (IC) appoint - ments in September 2017 as a new way to offer students first counseling appointments. ICs are a 20-minute brief assessment and treatment plan - ning meeting with a CPS counselor, replacing 50-minute intake appointments as the standard means available to students to first connect with CPS. The new IC system had the primary objec - tives of: expediting students' first contact with CPS so that they can be connected to services more efficiently; tailoring a treatment plan best suited to the student's needs; and improving management of CPS services and capacity. As just one measure of the success of these objectives, the average wait time for a first appointment decreased from 13 days in FY17 to six days during the year following the implementation of the IC system. In patient satis - faction surveys, students gave ICs high marks, indi - cating between 85% and 95% were \"satisfied\" or \"very satisfied\" with aspects such as the counsel - or's care in listening, the extent to which concerns were addressed, ease of scheduling, and the outcome of the consultation. SHARE Logic Model and Theory of Change SHARE's prevention work emphasizes the inter - sectionality between oppression and violence using multifaceted pedagogical approaches, such as peer-facilitated education, skills-based develop - ment of mindful allyship and bystander intervention, and the promotion of healthy and respectful relation - ships. This year, SHARE developed its first theory of change and logic model, including a SHARE purpose statement, to assist with the ongoing development and improvement of SHARE's preven - tion efforts and service, including the SHARE Peer Program. Both documents reinforce SHARE's inter - sectional work \u2014 current and future \u2014 with explicit intention. With the logic model and the theory of change now in place, SHARE has the grounding to develop a four-year prevention-based curriculum for undergraduates at Princeton. SHARE initiatives across multiple social-ecological levels (excerpt from the SHARE Logic Model)CPS introduced Initial Consultation (IC) appointments in September 2017 as a new way to offer students first counseling appointments.18UHS HIGHLIGHTS SHARE's Men's Allied Voices for a Respectful and Inclusive Community (MAVRIC) Project and Rolling With Rejection The MAVRIC Project, under the direction of the SHARE office, is an alliance of Princeton Univer - sity students, faculty, staff, and alumni committed to reducing interpersonal violence and abuse within our community by challenging social norms related to misogyny, sexism, stereotyping, and gender/sexual orientation bias. Through activism, education, mentoring, and fellowship, the MAVRIC Project explores male identity and promotes healthy masculinity to serve the dual aims of violence prevention and gender liberation. MAVRIC is supported by a steering committee made up of undergraduate and graduate students dedicated to shifting campus culture regarding masculinity. The steering committee engages in outreach and recruitment of students, develops and plans programs that support violence prevention, and collaborates with other student groups to foster inclusivity and allyship. In the spring of 2019, SHARE also piloted \"Rolling with Rejection\" (RwR), an evidence-in - formed 90-minute workshop that engages partic - ipants in discussion about the problematic inter - section of rejection, toxic masculinity, and sexual violence. RwR addresses the cognitive and emotional impact of rejection in men, exploring the link between entitlement and aggression. The workshop also supports participants in developing alternative perspectives on rejection, analyzing personal contributions to sexual assault culture, and identifying pro-social ways of challenging behavior that threatens the safety and well-being of others. Transgender Health Care UHS has worked to improve benefits and access to high quality, inclusive health care for trans - gender and nonbinary students. These improve - ments include enhanced coverage for gender affirming surgeries, updates to electronic health records, expanded medical services related to masculinizing and feminizing hormones, and the Thank you both so much for your presence in our LGBTQIA peer education training this year. The students found your session immensely helpf ul. \u2014To two Psychologists from the Lesbian, REPORT 2018-1919formation of a standing interdisciplinary team focused on transgender health care. The Transgender Health Care Team (THCT) provides guidance and recommenda - tions on best practices, policies, and staff trainings for gender affirming care. This interdisci - plinary team is comprised of members, from departments across UHS, with expertise in issues affecting transgender and nonbinary individuals. With guidance from the THCT, Medical Services has offered trainings related to care of transgender and nonbinary students as part of its onboarding process for new clinicians, regis - tered nurses, and medical assistants. Client services representatives \u2014 often the first point of contact for all students accessing services within UHS \u2014 have also received this training. In 2018 to 2019, Medical Services saw a threefold increase in the number of students seeking appointments for gender affirming care as compared to the previous year. The number of students utilizing student health plan benefits for gender affirming surgeries and procedures has also risen. In the realm of mental health support, Jess Joseph joined CPS and the TigerWell initiative in January 2019. Joseph specializes in gender affirming mental health and well-being for students. She partners with the Women*s Center, the Carl A. Fields Center, Scholars Institute Fellows Program, and the LGBT Center to provide accessible mental health services through satellite offices, community building, and programming. Our most recent service change, imple - mented in fall 2019, is modifying UHS electronic health records to include gender identity and pronoun choices for all students who use self- check-in kiosks for UHS appointments. UHS has also updated the Athletic Medicine electronic health history to be inclusive of all gender identities. Metrics In FY19, Health Services formed the UHS Metrics task group charged with reviewing UHS data sources and creating a new, comprehensive dash - board of key UHS data indicators. This dashboard will be used within UHS; some components will be shared with senior University administrators biannually. Initial steps of the project included developing a complete inventory of current UHS data sources, working with leaders within UHS to determine what data mattered, and deter - mining how key indicators could be most clearly and meaningfully presented. To date this year, in addition to reorganizing key Health Services data within a prescribed campus life spreadsheet format, the UHS Metrics task group developed a list of sources for all data points and populated spreadsheets with available data, including both utilization data and existing data on key indicators of UHS service quality. In addition, the task group added three-year comparisons, incorporated new data collection methodology, and reviewed UHS annual reports for additional data points that may belong in the new dashboard of key indicators. Next steps include adding visualization of tabular data to improve user friendliness. 20 STRATEGIC INITIATIVE 21 BIENNIAL REPORT 2018-19 Department & Carefully to ConcernsPrivacy and CondentialityImpacted Student/Employee 2019University Health Services IndicatorsBIENNIAL REPORT 2018-1923 Medical Services Located in the McCosh Health Center, Caldwell Field House, and Dillon Gym, Medical Services provides primary medical care as well as special - ized services such as athletic medicine, sexual health and wellness, global and community health, nutrition counseling, occupational health services, physical therapy, and radiological and laboratory services. With over a half-dozen clinical programs staffed by professionals from diverse disciplines, Medical Services continuously strives to develop innovative and integrative models of care. The broad representation of skills and expertise among its complement of providers enables Medical Services to offer a number of unique services that support students' health, well-being, and academic success. Outpatient Medical Clinic The Outpatient Medical Clinic is composed of a multidisciplinary team of college health profes - sionals that includes physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, nurses, medical assistants, and administrative support staff. All undergraduate and graduate students and their eligible depen - dents have access to primary health care, including same-day care for acute medical concerns, from the Outpatient Medical Clinic. The clinic also serves as an urgent care center for students and campus visitors who experience acute symptoms or injuries. Recent accomplishments in the Outpatient Medical Clinic include instituting process improve - ments to manage increases in the number of both students served and outpatient encounters. Urgent care was staffed this year with increased coverage during typical surge times. In order to respond flexibly to operational demands driven by student need, the nursing staff in the clinic also received cross-training to gain expertise in the clinical areas of immunization, sexual health and wellness, and triage. Patient satisfaction and other quality indicators again rose in FY19, even as utilization increased. In the past year, the Outpatient Medical Clinic implemented changes to improve the health of the population by improving access; by more effectively utilizing available resources, including improvements to scheduling and patient communi - cation; and by enhancing patient-centered practice through an increase in the number of meaningful e-medicine encounters. The clinic's continuous improvement in FY19 is reflected in quality indica - tors that are above or near UHS goals of 90-95% patient satisfaction. Global and Community Health The mission of the Global and Community Health Program (G+CH) is to provide up-to-date, evidence-based care and health education to Princeton students for all their travel, immuniza - tion, and infectious disease-related health issues, and to offer consultative services to the University community. G+CH develops policy recommenda - tions and measures aimed at preventing acquisi - tion of infectious diseases at the individual level, and mitigating the spread and impact of outbreaks should they occur. Princeton's campus contains multiple dormitories and dining halls in which approximately 100% of the undergraduate and approximately 70% of the graduate students live and eat. Students interact daily with faculty and staff. There are 12% increase in encounters in medical services 79% student population seen for medical reasons24DEPARTMENT AND UNIT REPORTS multiple opportunities for international student travel. As the University makes a strategic effort to grow its international programs, the volume and complexity of international activities increase, bringing higher demand for travel health services. Key accomplishments in G+CH this year include fostering strong collaboration with campus part - ners, including the Travel Oversight Group, the Institutional Biosafety Committee, and the Interna - tional Crisis Management Team, toward improved risk and crisis management of health threats locally and globally. The program also optimized a number of work processes related to travel health and immunization services, among them the engagement of students and campus partners with immunization compliance, the tuberculosis control program, increased accuracy in managing immunization inventory, and the revision of travel- and immunization-related documentation templates for increased accuracy, accountability, and data usability. In addition, in the past two years G+CH has introduced several measures to enhance quality of service, including pre-visit screening for mental health and substance use concerns for all travel health visits, and the formation of a multidisciplinary ad hoc Flu Surge Committee to better and more efficiently manage the historically high volume flu season. With the goal of increasing influenza immunization rates on campus, G+CH also initiated a systematic analysis of \"FluFest,\" our annual series of flu vaccination clinics. Improved data analysis as well as a student-led survey provided insights regarding the accessibility and convenience of FluFest services. As a result, in FY19 G+CH imple - mented new measures that led to a 14% increase in the influenza immunization rates of undergraduates through FluFest alone. Finally, UHS' Global and Community Health and Information Technology (IT) colleagues engaged students without immunity to measles by incorporating proactive messaging at key contact times in order to decrease the number of students who are nonimmune to the measles virus. While the \"MMR\" (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine is required for all students by New Jersey law, the law also allows for medical and religious exemptions (RE). For many years Princeton has fined noncompliant students and/or held their class registration, but these enforcement strategies have 3,511 Num ber of flu shots administered at Flufest to students 46% Percent of Undergraduate students receiving a flu shot at flufest.

To address concerns regarding students lacking immunity to measles, the team arranged for a report to be generated weekly that identified enrolled undergraduate and graduate students who were not immune to measles according to the CDC's criteria for immunity. Notifications and educa - tional materials were sent via secure messaging and/or email. Students with no immunization data were provided instructions on record submission. Reminders were sent to those due for a second MMR. Students with RE were offered blood tests for measles immunity. Alerts were placed in the Electronic Health Record (EHR) of all nonimmune students so they could be reminded at every encounter. Student travelers on Princeton Univer - sity sponsored trips were informed about measles outbreaks and, often, it was possible to make MMR a requirement for participation in the trip. As a result of these interventions, compli - ance moved from 82 students who were measles nonimmune (two with medical and 23 with reli - gious exemption; 57 lacking second MMR or with no immunization data) in December of 2018 to eight students either lacking second MMR or with no immunization data, by May of 2019. This inter - vention showed that students who had remained nonimmune to measles despite the regular immu - nization compliance activities were brought to compliance with messaging designed to engage, educate, and build trust. Sexual Health and Wellness Sexual Health and Wellness (SHAW) is an inte - grated service within UHS in which all UHS medical clinicians address acute sexual health concerns, while a subgroup of highly trained clinicians focuses on specialized sexual health and well - ness. SHAW's comprehensive services include birth control options; sexually transmitted infection testing, information, and treatment; pregnancy and options counseling; colposcopy counseling for LGBT individuals; and evaluation, monitoring, and prescriptions for contra-hormone therapy for medical gender affirmation. SHAW staff members also serve as consultative sexual health experts and resources for staff members in UHS and across campus. For example, SHAW offered trainings both on and off campus on gender identity diversity and inclusive, gender affirming care (see page 18 for a highlight regarding transgender care). Regarding transgender care, in FY19 SHAW noted a significant rise in the number of transgender/ nonbinary students who presented for services ranging from consultations for gender affirming hormones to pre-certifications for surgeries. Diagnostic Services: Radiology and Laboratory UHS provides services and diagnostic testing (electrocardiograms, audiograms, spirom - etry) for students and employees. Equipped with a Shimadzu RadSpeed digital radiographic unit with a Canon digital detector, Radiology offers diagnostic services that enhance image resolu - tion and decrease radiation dosage with a goal of maximizing patient safety, quality of care, effi - ciency, and cost-effectiveness. Accomplishments this year include new processes to coordinate cardiac screening for student athletes, success -In response to a stressful situation, a staff member at the UHS reception desk acted promptly and booked a vaccine slot for me in the afternoon. She also helped me fill out some forms that I had missed, and when I showed up at 4PM, it took literally 10 minutes to get the shot, get all the information about the vaccine I was missing, and get my account up and working again. I was very impressed by the efficiency with which my case was processed. Please pass my warmest thanks to the whole UHS team. \u2014From a Graduate Student to the Associate Director, Administration26DEPARTMENT AND UNIT REPORTS fully passing the New Jersey Department of Envi - ronmental Protection Agency's Quality Assurance Review and Radiation Survey, and cross-training other clinical staff in how to administer EKG studies. UHS offers laboratory testing and spec - imen processing for students and employees through Quest Diagnostics. Clinical and Sports Nutrition Services UHS Clinical and Sports Nutrition Services addresses the needs of our student body through nutrition-focused counseling, education, and programming. With a focus on sports nutrition, eating disorders and concerns, and nutrition-re - lated medical diagnoses, Nutrition Services uses a multifaceted approach to improving the nutri - tion, health, and athletic performance of Princ - eton students. Our clinically trained nutrition staff emphasizes evidence-based methods and a balanced lifestyle to help students attain their nutritional and food goals both on and off campus. This year Athletics acquired the Bod Pod, a tool for accurate and comprehensive body composition testing. Because body composition measurement is essential for nutrition evalua -tion, monitoring, and planning, the Bod Pod will be an important resource for addressing eating and energy availability concerns in athletes and for managing the nutrition of athletes participating in weight-restricted sports. In collaboration with Athletics, Nutrition Services also initiated \"TRAIN\" (T = Think adequate energy, R = Rest and recovery, A = Always hydrate, I = Improve food quality, and N = Nutrient timing). TRAIN is a streamlined educa - tional framework covering key nutrition topics that will be presented to all Princeton athletes in FY20. Athletic Medicine The mission of Athletic Medicine at UHS is to provide the highest quality health care to student athletes. The Department of Athletic Medicine is composed of a multidisciplinary team that works collaboratively with Athletics and includes primary sports medicine physicians, athletic trainers, physical therapists, nurses, a sports dietitian, and research assistants. Athletic Medicine cares for the muscu - loskeletal and sports-related needs of student athletes from 38 varsity teams and two club teams. The department also provides on-site clinical care, practice and competition coverage, 585 Num ber of EKGs performed for students: 585 1,556 Number of xrays for students 50 Num ber of xrays for employeesBIENNIAL REPORT 2018-1927and travel support to the athletic teams. All Princ - eton students, including those who are not varsity athletes, also have access to sports medicine physicians and physical therapists to address sports-related injuries and health concerns. When needed, Athletic Medicine also offers consulta - tion and referral to external medical and surgical specialists. Athletic Medicine clinicians also provide comprehensive physical examinations, including screening for concussions as well as cardiac, mental health, and musculoskeletal problems, to all first-year student athletes. Athletic Medicine staff members partici - pate in multidisciplinary UHS teams, including the Eating Disorder Team and the Performance and Wellness (PAWS) Team, and in collaboration with Athletics, also support the Student Athletes Well - ness Leaders peer intervention program. Key departmental accomplishments in Athletic Medicine this year include process improvements to sports physicals to increase effi - ciency and more seamlessly coordinate the care of student athletes with complex medical issues. Scheduling and staffing were modified in order to extend the hours of the Caldwell training room. Athletic Medicine also developed and imple - mented process improvements to onboarding for coaching and athletic training staff. A national and international leader in the study of concussions and head impact exposure in college sports, Athletic Medicine at UHS continues to spearhead key research in the field. Athletic Medicine staff produced numerous publications and presentations on sports concussion research for major journals and conferences. Infirmary UHS operates a 15-bed infirmary to care for students who require overnight care. The Infir - mary staff provide highly skilled, compassionate, convenient nursing care to graduate and under - graduate students with a range of medical and mental health concerns 24 hours a day, seven days a week during the academic year. The Infir - mary offers a supportive environment for recovery from acute illness or injury in college students who might otherwise be hospitalized or return home to recover, potentially jeopardizing academic goals. As a 24-hour unit, the Infirmary provides students I so appreciate your comprehen - sive informative reply as well as the exceptional over - sight and care of the athletes. Like all we have seen and experienced at Princeton, you and the medical team are dedicated to excellence and provide \"above and beyond care\" of students and their parents. Truly, thank you. \u2014To the Director, Athletic Medicine from a parent who is a Nurse Practitioner 24,942 Number of visits with Athletic Trainers 112 Number of Athletic events covered by an Athletic Medicine physicianBIENNIAL REPORT 2018-1929 with access to after-hours evaluation and treatment of acute medical and mental health concerns. Infir - mary nursing staff also coordinates care when transfer to a higher level of care is needed. The nursing staff also administers care and coordina - tion following discharge from an acute care setting, supporting a safe return to campus and academic life. To maintain the health of the campus at large, the Infirmary affords a more isolated setting for students recovering from communicable diseases that could otherwise lead to disease outbreaks. Registered nurses, assisted by nurse's aides, provide care 24 hours a day while physicians and mental health providers make daily rounds and are on call 24 / 7. The Infirmary staff utilizes a holistic approach to nursing care, assessing psychosocial, emotional, spiritual, behavioral, and cultural factors affecting each student and their health. Key accomplishments in FY19 include streamlining the Medicat medication inventory, as well as collaboration with other UHS departments to create the Flu Surge Committee to improve the rapid flu testing parameters and create guidelines for administering ad hoc vaccines to clinical staff. This year also saw increased nursing staff participation in outreach activities, including the \"The Freshman Project,\" which entailed creating care packages for all incoming first-year students. Each care package included hand sanitizer, a digital thermometer, single doses of both Tylenol and Motrin, cold medication, cough drops, and an information sheet with instructions for medication use. Infirmary nurses assembled the care pack - ages and distributed them at first-year orientation. The Freshman Project and other outreach efforts extend the reach of UHS by facilitating health education and access to services. Occupational Health Services The overarching aim of Occupational Health Services at UHS is to support the health of Princ - eton University employees and prevent work-re - lated illness and injury. Like all UHS services, Occu - pational Health Services takes a holistic approach, offering staff and faculty employees assessments and care coordination for work-related injuries or illnesses; medical clearance for return to work; recommendations regarding medical parking requests; and immunizations, travel assessments, and health education. Also featured are employee wellness programs and screenings for issues such as smoking cessation, heart health, and diabetes. Key accomplishments in FY19 included maintaining a high level of service following the retirement of the Occupational Health Services director. Occupational Health Services main - tained the same operational hours and services this year, while absorbing a 6% increase in office visits as compared to FY17. Patient satisfaction surveys this year consistently resulted in scores of 90-95% (\"satisfied\" or \"very satisfied\") across a range of questions. Employees rated their \"overall satisfaction\" with Occupational Health Services as 99% \"satisfied\" or \"very satisfied.\" Occupational Health Services also contributed to the Univer - sity receiving Continued Full Accreditation status from the American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC) that referenced Princeton's \"synergistic interactions of all elements of the program.\" This year, patient satisfaction scores for questions related to diversity and inclusion increased substantially. Occupational Health I wanted to take a moment to share my sincerest gratitude for the extraordinary team at McCosh Health Center at Princeton University. Throughout my care, [Medical clinicians at UHS] and their care teams have continued to demonstrate a high standard of care beyond my expectations. I am grateful for so many of these individuals at Princeton University that took care of me during this difficult illness. The team at McCosh Health Center have been instrumental in ensuring that my care was impeccable. Everyone involved from start to finish was extraordinary. \u2014To the Director, University Health Services from a student3,122 Number o f after hours urgent care visits to Infirmary 997 Numbe r of admissions to the Infirmary30DEPARTMENT AND UNIT REPORTS Services has also implemented further process improvements related to diversity and inclusion issues. The Patient Satisfaction Survey was trans - lated into Spanish and French to increase the participation of non-English speaking employees. Questions regarding gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, and religion were included in Occupa - tional Health Services templates and asked at the start of each patient visit to ensure that any related concerns were addressed. To further improve access to and participation in the survey, Occu - pational Health Services plans to offer the use of a tablet so that employees who do not use their Princeton email can complete the survey at the end of a visit. Counseling and Psychological Services (CPS) CPS provides a wide range of services to address students' psychological needs and mental health concerns. The psychologists, psychiatric providers, clinical social workers, postdoctoral psychology fellows, and social work interns on the CPS staff offer expert mental health services to Princeton graduate and undergraduate students and their dependents. Interdisciplinary clinical teams treat students with specific mental health needs, including eating concerns, alcohol and other drug problems, and chronic self-harm or suicidality. CPS clinical staff also provides consultation to deans, athletic team coaches, faculty, residential college advisors, family members, friends, or other members of the community who express concern about a student. CPS continues to see high demand for its services as well as increases in emergent situa - Thank you very much for leading today's workshop. I'm so appreciative of the collaborative spirit the faculty and staff brought to the room today and the deep care they showed for identifying, understanding and supporting those who are in distress.

This year both the number of clinical appointments and the number of students seen rose slightly from the previous year. The acuity of mental health issues in students presenting to CPS also continues to increase compared to last year, as evidenced by a 19% increase in students referred to the emergency room or hospital and a 28% increase in students hospitalized for mental health concerns. Since 2014, CPS has provided mental health services to 48% more students and has seen a 95% increase in the number of clinical sessions completed. 32DEPARTMENT AND UNIT REPORTS CPS collects data on the effectiveness of its services. All students seen complete the Behavioral Health Measure-20 (BHM-20), a stan - dardized clinical symptom inventory, at every counseling visit. The BHM-20 enables CPS to track each student's level of improvement and to compare CPS outcomes to a 2014 national bench - mark sample of 13,808 students from 23 college counseling centers. The data indicates that CPS provides highly effective treatment, and that measures of improvement among students seen at CPS significantly surpass those documented in the benchmark study. Sixty-five percent of Princ - eton students showed improvement in \"well- being,\" compared to 27% of those in the bench - mark sample. Likewise, 56% of students seen at CPS (as compared to 39.9% in the benchmark group) saw improvement in their psychological symptoms. The counseling service continues to offer a broad array of outreach events in addition to direct clinical services. This year CPS facilitated 174 outreach events for 6,408 students, an increase of 12% in the number of students reached. The Princ - eton Distress Awareness and Response program offered multiple trainings, reaching 30% more faculty and staff this year than last year. In FY19, CPS also launched the Kognito At-Risk for Students online gatekeeper training for first-year students. After completing the Kognito simulation to learn about how to support students in distress, 1,300 first-year students participated in discussions, led by Residential College Advisors, about the training and campus resources. This year CPS completed its four-year membership with the Jed Foundation Campus Program, during which CPS worked to institute several recommendations from the Jed Campus Team to increase well-being and decrease student suicide and substance abuse. Major initiatives implemented include the opening of CPS satellite offices (see Highlight, page 17), the transition to a triage initial consultation model (see \"Highlight,\" page 17), the launch of a website for students considering a leave of absence, and mental health screenings in the medical service. BIENNIAL REPORT 2018-1933Sexual Harassment/Assault Advising, Resources, and Education (SHARE) SHARE strives to foster a safe, respectful, inclu - sive, and supportive campus through interpersonal violence prevention efforts and by supporting survivors. As advocates, SHARE helps to empower survivors of interpersonal violence through acces - sible, trauma-informed, survivor-centered, and culturally relevant services, from individual to systemic levels. For the past two years SHARE has served an all-time high number of clients; in FY19, SHARE also absorbed a 15% growth in utilization. Client records were reviewed to clarify factors driving the increased utilization, revealing common themes for those who attended 10 or more therapeutic and/or advocacy meetings with a SHARE clinician. These themes include the offender remaining in the community; safety planning needs; history (prior to this University) of domestic violence, sexual assault, and/or stalking; pursuit of Title IX process; inade -70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 Noticing a problematic situationIdentifying when it is appropriate to interveneBeing responsible for intervening so no one is harmedPossessing the skills to interveneIntervening in a problematic situation Pre Tests - \"Very Condent\" Post Tests - \"Very Condent\"PERCENT REPORTING 25,000 20,000 15,000 10,000 5,000 0 FY FY 2014 FY YEAR44615456107331502721306 21190quate support network of friends and/or family; and limited healthy coping skills. SHARE's programming consists of both prevention and awareness efforts. During FY19, SHARE facilitated 68 prevention programs and 31 awareness programs. In one of the prevention programs, SHARE staff partnered with local Princ - eton artist Andre Veloux to create \"The Pause \u2014 Enthusiastic Consent Art Workshop.\" During the four-hour event, 60 students, staff, faculty, and community members worked in pairs to create an original piece of art made out of Legos. Volunteers actively practiced seeking and receiving consent from their partner as they worked collaboratively on their portion of the image. Later, upon reviewing the finished artwork depicting enthusiastic consent between two gender and racially ambiguous figures, partners reflected on what it meant to apply the principles of consent (voluntary, ongoing, mutual, verbal) to an everyday activity.

Following this training, 98% of the first-year survey respondents indicated they understood that others count on them to intervene in a potentially dangerous situation, and 97% reported being able to use one or more of the bystander intervention strategies learned in the training. Health Promotion and Prevention Services Health Promotion and Prevention Services (HPPS), a team of health promotion professionals, advo - cates for the creation and sustenance of condi - tions necessary for the well-being of the Princeton community and all its members. HPPS accom - plishes this by applying socio-ecological and social justice perspectives to four strategies: health promotion expertise and consultation; building community capacity through strategic partner - ships; training and skills building; and assessment, research, and communications. HPPS addresses high-visibility topics of concern related to the health and well-being of the campus community, including physical and mental well-being, sexual health, alcohol and other drug use, bystander intervention, and sleep issues. In FY19, HPPS led multiple new and ongoing projects, including the Peer Health Advisor program, educational interventions around alcohol and other drug use, a departmental strategic plan - ning process, biannual mental health screening days, the campus-wide Healthier Princeton Advi - sory Board, and also collaborated with CPS and SHARE colleagues on Princeton's active bystand - ership initiative, UMatter. HPPS has also shared expertise and guidance with decision-makers across campus around health and well-being goals over the past year and continues to support the rollout and implementation of the Diversity and Inclusion Framework for Campus Life. Finally, this year HPPS oversaw the launch of TigerWell, an initiative that engages partners across campus in promoting well-being through skills building, outreach, events, professional development, and program evaluation. Since the arrival of the project manager and the outreach psychologists, TigerWell and HPPS have made significant strides in creating initiative infrastructure, delivering targeted outreach, and facilitating health and well-being-related activities across campus through both resource allocation and consultation.

Quality and Performance Improvement The Quality and Performance Improvement (QPI) department drives projects and activities that support quality improvement at UHS. QPI is broad in scope and addresses client service and satis - faction, employee engagement, cost-of-care, and quality and safety performance issues and outcomes. As patient care is a coordinated effort, UHS' approach to quality improvement involves multiple departments and disciplines in estab - lishing processes and mechanisms that support quality improvement activities within the UHS. The mission of the QPI department is supported by the UHS Quality Improvement Committee (QIC), which is comprised of clinicians and administrators from across the organization. The QIC oversees organization-wide and area-spe - cific quality improvement efforts within UHS, including quality improvement studies, peer review, process improvement, risk management, client and employee satisfaction surveys, continuing educa - tion seminars, and benchmarking studies. The QPI department has partnered with UHS leadership to develop whole system indi - cators, a balanced set of system-level measures that provide leaders and other stakeholders with data to assess overall organizational performance on core dimensions of quality and value. These measures support the UHS strategic initiative by measuring quality across the entire organization. In FY19, the QPI department also worked with key service areas, including SHARE, CPS, Occupational Health Services, and Outpatient Medical on devel - oping unit-specific measures to support the Insti - tute of Medicine health care quality improvement framework. During the past two years, QPI has devel - oped studies to enhance our understanding and knowledge in key realms of college health. Specifically: Acute uncomplicated bronchitis (AUB) is a leading cause of ambulatory care visits within the United States. Despite its Clinical Benchmarkin g Study QI Interventions introduced in UHS to drive ABx Stewardship. New & per-diem sta driving poor ABx compliance. Corrective actions taken to improve ABx compliance among these sta. . Corrective actions toward New & per-diem improved ABx compliance back to 100%. . QI-Interventions piloted on frequent/common respiratory illnesses treated within our healthcare facility (including bronchitis) as part of a larger Antibiotic Stewardship Program. . DEPARTMENT AND UNIT REPORTS etiology, overprescribing of antibiotics persists. This prescribing pattern is concerning because of the potential for microbial antibiotic resistance and adverse drug reactions. The American College Health Association (ACHA) performed a national survey in 2014, with 66 university health centers participating, including Princeton University. The ACHA study found many students (i.e., approxi - mately 56% nationally) inappropriately received antibiotics for their acute bronchitis. However, 80% of our bronchitis cases (n = 25 random charts reviewed) were inappropriately prescribed antibi - otics, indicating a 20% treatment compliance for the Princeton University Health Center. We initiated a quality improvement (QI) study to drive antibiotic stewardship for AUB within our university health care center. The objective of the QI study was to have an antibiotic prescription rate for AUB at a level of 10% or less (i.e., at least 90% compliance). These QI interventions significantly improved our antibiotic prescription rate from a baseline of 20% to a level of 90% or greater compliance. The study was nominated as a national finalist for the AAAHC 2018-19 Bernard A. Kershner Innovations in Quality Improvement Award. UHS conducted a benchmarking study regarding levels of satisfaction with Electronic Health Records (EHRs) in the college/university health field in order to add to the body of knowl - edge and assist members with system/vendor selection. Nine health centers at highly selec - tive colleges and universities participated in this benchmarking study. Multidisciplinary staff (n = 316) received an anonymous 32-item survey to assess levels of agreement/satisfaction on statements pertaining to their EHR's functionality. The EHRs most commonly used by participants were Point and Click, Medicat, Allscripts, and EPIC. There was variation on levels of user satisfaction/agreement within features among the EHR systems, but differ - ences were not statistically significant. No systems emerged as clear \"winners\" in terms of user satis - faction. Features were identified within systems that could be leveraged to meet specific care delivery and quality reporting needs among college/univer - sity health professionals. This study was presented as a poster session at the 24th Annual Scientific Symposium on Improving the Quality and Value of Healthcare; Institute for Healthcare Improvement, 2018, in Orlando, Florida. Yearly Antibiotic (ABx)Treatment Compliance for Acute BronchitisBIENNIAL REPORT 2018-1937Adherence to recommended Hand Hygiene (HH) procedures can significantly reduce the risk of cross-transmission of infection within health care facilities. To deliver high-quality care in a cost-effective manner, we conducted a QI study to understand and address barriers toward HH within a university health care setting. The primary goal of this QI study was to achieve the \"advanced\" hand hygiene level (a score of >376) on the World Health Organization Hand Hygiene Self-Assessment Framework (HHSAF) tool through the use of multimodal interventions. A secondary goal was to achieve the American College Health Association (ACHA) benchmark for hand hygiene practice on our patient satisfaction instrument. We found that the QI interventions substantially impacted our HH culture/practice, with overall HHSAF scores improving from a basic (baseline: 200 points, September 2015) to an advanced level (440 points, June 2018). Patient reported measures of hand hygiene compliance showed that scores increased each year of the study, and were above the ACHA benchmark in both 2017 and 2018. This study was presented as a poster session at the 25th Annual Scientific Symposium on Improving the Quality and Value of Healthcare; Institute for Healthcare Improvement, 2019, in Orlando, Florida. Information Technology The Information Technology (IT) unit supports the mission of UHS by providing technology support services, infrastructure, program management, business applications, IT processes, and profes - sional services/consulting. Our business appli - cations include two electronic health record installations and ancillary systems such as digital radiology. Infrastructure includes the computers, peripherals (e.g., printers and scanners), security systems, and servers required by UHS. IT also manages the secure movement of data in and out of UHS electronic systems. IT consulting is required throughout the organization to support improvements in work processes through project management, systems development, data reports, and support for clinical studies. IT's programs follow policies and proce -dures developed by UHS, the Office of Information Technology, and industry best practices. In FY19, IT accomplished several process improvements within UHS, including creating a pre-visit screening process and forms (including depression or \"PHQ-9,\" anxiety or \"GAD-7,\" alcohol use and abuse or \"AUDIT-C,\" and key dimensions related to sexual health); developing a process and providing electronic forms enabling CPS to track high-risk clients in Medicat; and modifying Student Health Plan enrollment forms to collect information on third-party insurance online. IT also worked with a multidisciplinary UHS task force to improve the onboarding and exit processes for staff, and further automated and streamlined the IT onboarding process. In response to security audit recom - mendations, IT made improvements to systems and security and initiated a project to establish an information security framework to govern UHS' IT security program. Student Health Plan Princeton University provides health insurance through the Student Health Plan (SHP), adminis - tered by Aetna Student Health and available to enrolled undergraduate and graduate students and their eligible dependents. Undergraduates may opt out of the SHP by providing private insurance infor - mation, while graduate students are automatically enrolled in the SHP. 2,947 UHS IT help desk tickets closed (10% increase)38DEPARTMENT AND UNIT REPORTS The SHP office continues to see steady increases in enrollment in the dental and vision plans as well as the SHP, suggesting that students and parents recognize the comprehensive benefits of Princeton's plans as well as the cost differentials when compared with existing family plans. New initiatives this year include a revised Comparable Coverage Criteria checklist, providing clearer information about the SHP and key coverage that students should have if choosing to opt out of Princeton's Student Health Plan. New instructions were also posted to the SHP website on submitting electronic claims. The Mental Health Exclusive Provider Network (EPN), composed of out-of-network mental health providers who will see Princeton students on the SHP for an affordable copay, continues to gain participants (121 psychotherapy and psychiatry providers to date, compared to 90 last year). Many students who use the EPN express appreciation for the option of accessing high-quality, affordable community mental health treatment off campus. The SHP office also assists EPN providers with an instructional/FAQ guide regarding claims submis - sion, reimbursement rates, and information about primary and secondary insurance. 5800 5600 5400 5200 5000 4800 4400 2018 2019 STUDENT ENROLLMENT45744791502553015495 2500 2300 2100 1900 1700 1500 1300 1100 Dental Vision2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 ENROLLMENT 1757 1587201323462467 1312 1170143516821766Student Health Plan Enrollment Dental and Vision Enrollment BIENNIAL REPORT 2018-19 The University Health Services budget, most of which is allocated for the salaries of the 113 staff members (95 full-time employees) who serve the Princeton University community, is drawn from Princeton University general funds. UHS services are provided free of charge to students, with a few modest exceptions. UHS also brings in grant funding to support its work whenever possible. Finally, the Auxiliary to the Isabella McCosh Infir - mary is a key partner. Since 1902, the Auxiliary to the Isabella McCosh Infirmary has played a key role in furthering the growth and quality of health care services provided at the University. It was the Auxiliary that, in 1919, hired an architect to design a new building, and raised the funds to build the existing McCosh Health Center. The Auxiliary has supported many of the campus' health care needs by soliciting dues and donations from friends of the health service as well as from parents. Auxiliary members oversee several endowment funds that allow UHS to purchase equipment, support educational programs, renovate facilities, and pay for medical expenses that students cannot afford and insurance does not cover. The Auxiliary stewards existing endow - ments and raises new funds to maintain high-Stewardship quality student care. Over the past two years the Auxiliary provided funding for the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) Open School train - ings for UHS staff, ProtoCall telephonic behavioral health services, iPads to enable health screenings at the point of service, an ultrasound transducer, otoscope/ophthalmoscopes, computer hardware and software, routine lab tests for students, Kognito At-Risk for Students simulation technology, and much, much more. The Auxiliary also funds the Special Needs Fund that assists eligible students with up to $300 per year for health care needs such as dental care, emergency room visits, surgery, specialist visits, mental health care, eyeglasses, and transporta - tion to appointments. In FY19 alone, the Special Needs Fund provided more than $47,349 to help 179 students with health care expenses. Auxiliary members have also worked to increase awareness of services offered at UHS, to volunteer for admin - istrative activities, and to make the physical envi - ronment in McCosh Health Center more welcoming and cheerful for students, parents, and staff. UHS is grateful to the Auxiliary for its long-standing, generous support that has benefited generations of Princeton students. 3940 Despite considerable challenges, and at a moment when higher education's purpose is increasingly called into question, we in Campus Life and Univer - sity Health remain optimistic about what the future can be and the role campus systems of care can play in realizing the potential of Princeton's remark - able students. Here, we will reflect on future chal - lenges and opportunities for UHS and for our students as we support their efforts to become the best versions of themselves. Mental Health Concerns on the Rise This is an area of national conversation about what has been called the growing college \"mental health\" crisis that colleges are seen as struggling or failing to adequately address. This crisis includes not just suicidal ideation and/or suicide but also increased rates of depression, anxiety, stress, social or interpersonal skill deficits, self-harming behaviors, problems regulating emotions, and other diagnosable disorders. Students' demand for services is outpacing schools' efforts to meet those demands, whether through staff augmenta - tion, modified triage and referral practices, or new models of therapy. There are signs that stigma associated with mental health conditions are abating, which contributes to the rising demand for care. Princeton is not alone; these issues are affecting peer institutions as well. At the Consor - tium on Financing Higher Education Annual Meeting in 2019, student mental health and well- being was a major topic. Data collected from Princ - eton and other colleges and universities show that this cluster of peer institutions faces similar increases in the prevalence of many mental disor -ders and a sharp rise in demand for counseling and other health services. Leaders at University Health Services regularly share ideas and best or emerging best practices with our \"Ivy Plus\" colleagues in order to identify creative solutions for the future. Attending college is an immersion experi - ence that maximizes opportunities for stimulation and growth and also carries with it inherent stress on the student. Stress and other health concerns affect learning and can have a negative impact upon undergraduate and graduate students. The college years are a time when students are challenged in multiple ways, academ - ically, socially, personally, and spiritually. Students embark on their college journey at the peak of their vulnerability to the onset of psychiatric disorders. Only recently has the uncomfortable truth entered higher education discourse that the primary cause of disability in people age 15-25 is psychiatric disor - ders. Ever-increasing numbers of students are coming to college having been diagnosed with a mental health concern during elementary and high school years. Supporting students in constructive ways who wish to remain at Princeton while they address sometimes profoundly challenging issues is a cornerstone of our work. A Growing Number of Students With Diagnosed Chronic Health Conditions Increasing numbers of students either come to Princeton with chronic health conditions ranging from severe asthma to cancer, or such conditions are identified in the course of their university expe - rience.

UHS clinicians are familiar with remark - able stories of our students who, despite a debil - itating health condition, surmount obstacles and thrive in ways that inspire others. Applying the Science of Well-being The science of well-being holds great promise for our students and the campus community generally. For example, considerable research and experi - ence with university students confirms that positive conventions of mind and body can be learned and, with a modicum of practice, sustained well after graduation. The contemplative sciences, including various approaches to meditation, resetting cogni - tive patterns, stress reduction, resilience support, and the encouragement of pro-social behaviors represent an area of ongoing and future focus at Princeton and nationally. TigerWell, an initia - tive created through a generous donation from the Elcan Family Fund for Wellness Innovation, is supporting well-being programs across campus. We anticipate that many aspects of the Princeton experience, such as policies, learning environ - ments, and physical spaces, will be reviewed and considered for improvement through the lens of well-being. Changing Demographics Changing demographics and backgrounds of those attending college play a role in shaping adjustment to college settings \u2014 whether students are first in their family to attend college, are living for the first time thousands of miles away from their home and family, or hail from lower socioeco - nomic backgrounds. These students can benefit from special effort in terms of supportive program - ming, compassion, and understanding. Attention to campus climate is essential here, for these students may struggle with a sense of belonging in ways different from other students. Institutions must prepare to serve an increasingly diverse mix of students in the years to come. The National Center for Education Statistics projects a rise in Black and Hispanic students in the coming years, some of whom may face special challenges. All Applying the Science of Well-being44FUTURE DIRECTIONS: CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES students might not share common definitions of health and health care, and some may have reason to mistrust health care settings, often due to having had negative experiences with health professionals or systems. We must be ready to embrace all students with a compassionate understanding of differences. Generational Differences It is widely recognized that students of this generation are confronted with challenges that are different in kind and intensity from those of previous generations. Today's students struggle to negotiate the blessings and burdens of social media. New technological developments will continue to affect and shape how we use our time. As these technologies evolve, our charge is to understand the student experience and identify ways in which we can validate our students' efforts to understand themselves and give to others \u2014 all in the face of rising distractions. Meeting the chal - lenges inherent in such rapid technological change will continue to be a priority. Increasing Diversity Diversity-related themes and issues in higher education continue to remain salient. As reported by Princeton's Dean for Diversity and Inclusion in the Division of Campus Life, topics prominently featured in major news outlets across the country have included student bias and discrimination, the enrollment of students from low-income back - grounds, affirmative action policy, xenophobia, Islamophobia, white nationalism, and anti-Semi - tism on college campuses. Most recently, there have been national and global conversations, often contentious, related to the needs of religious minorities (e.g., Muslims), undocumented students, BIENNIAL REPORT 2018-1945and transgender students on our campuses. The political rhetoric, which remains prominent, has contributed to increased tensions, angst, and insecurity among students who hold these identi - ties, as well as those who hold marginalized and/ or multiple identities. UHS continues to expand and deepen our staff's knowledge and skills so that they may engage effectively with concepts of difference, inclusion, and identity as they apply to health care delivery. International Study, Travel, and Telehealth Princeton is a global institution whose students, staff, and faculty routinely travel, work, and study abroad. This trend will continue to grow. Princ - eton's goal that all students will have an educa - tional experience abroad at some point during their time as a student requires UHS to be prepared to support students and other community members in other parts of the world. Our Global and Commu - nity Health area will need to grow to support these developments. As more and more students study and travel abroad, telehealth will become common - place as a way to support the physical and mental health of students who experience difficulties. We are monitoring the market for systems that meet our clinical, legal, and technological requirements. Use and Misuse of Illicit and Legal Substances Experimentation with drug use is often part of late adolescent and young adult life. High risk drinking is a perennial concern and Princeton's public health approach addresses this through a web of interventions. The advent of medical marijuana in New Jersey and the possible legalization of recre - ational marijuana are developments that we are actively monitoring and working to address through health prevention and promotion programming. Some colleges are becoming battlegrounds in the conflict between federal and state marijuana laws as students (and employees) who use medical marijuana challenge decades-old campus drug policies. In states where medical marijuana is legal, such as New Jersey, students disciplined for using it are taking their schools to court. College officials argue they could lose federal funding for failing to follow federal law that labels cannabis an illegal drug with no accepted medical use. Vaping is at present under close scrutiny at Princeton and elsewhere. The use of new vaping technologies to deliver addictive levels of nico - tine is concerning even as the FDA is now highly involved in the regulation of these technologies. Many of the advances that have been made in decreasing late adolescent smoking could be reversed if teens become addicted to nicotine and then transition to combustible tobacco. We continue to collect data on vaping, monitor new information, and engage in regular harm reduction work around all substances. Interpersonal Violence and Support for Survivors The national movement for survivors of interper - sonal violence to come forward has affected Princ - eton as well. UHS works with campus colleagues to prevent the escalation of problem behaviors before violence occurs, and to serve those who have been harmed. In recent years, the SHARE staff has grown, which has allowed us to expand and improve prevention programming, enhance trainings, and respond to increasing demand for support and services. As the barriers to disclo - sure of violent occurrences continue to erode, we expect continued spikes in the number of students who come forward to tell their story and consider which options to exercise. You all have given me such outstanding care, and seen me through so many difficult things. I don't imagine I will ever again in my life receive the quality of primary care that I got at UHS....I don't know if I will ever be able to express my gratitude to you and UHS for your care throughout my graduate school career. \u2014To a Physician from a graduating student461868-1888 Isabella G.
