Many forms of magnesium supplements either cause cramping/stomach upset (oral options) or are itchy (sprays). But not ours! We've blended pure magnesium chloride with nourishing oils and butters that moisturize your skin while the magnesium absorbs quickly. The result is healthy skin and a healthy body! Formulated by an herbalist and mother of 6 and trusted by thousands of happy customers, Good Night Lotion is safe for the whole family. Made with the cleanest, most recognizable ingredients, like apricot oil, mango butter, and plant-based candelilla wax, with absolutely no compromises. Take your family's health into your own hands and enjoy the benefits of magnesium immediately, in an easy-to-use lotion -- 100 mg magnesium per teaspoon!
