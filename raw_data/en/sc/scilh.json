COVID-19 Testing: What You Need to Know - Make sure to test at the right time - Choose the right type of test for your circumstance - Follow test directions as recommended by FDA If you do not, your results may be less likely to correctly indicate whether you have COVID-19 or not. Types of Tests Viral tests look for a current infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, by testing specimens from your nose or mouth. All tests should be performed following FDA's requirements. There are two main types of viral tests: - Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) tests - Antigen tests PCR Tests PCR tests are the \"gold standard\" for COVID-19 tests. They are a type of nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT), which are more likely to detect the virus than antigen tests. Your sample will usually be taken by a healthcare provider and transported to a laboratory for testing. It may take up to 3 days to receive results. Antigen Tests Antigen tests* are rapid tests that usually produce results in 15-30 minutes. Positive results are very accurate and reliable. However, in general, antigen tests are less likely to detect the virus than PCR tests, especially when [symptoms](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html) are not present. Therefore, a single negative antigen test cannot rule out infection. To be confident you do not have COVID-19, [FDA recommends](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/safety-communications/home-covid-19-antigen-tests-take-steps-reduce-your-risk-false-negative-fda-safety-communication) 2 negative antigen tests for individuals with symptoms or 3 antigen tests for those without symptoms, performed 48 hours apart. A single PCR test can be used to confirm an antigen test result. *Self-tests, or at-home tests, are antigen tests that can be taken anywhere without having to go to a specific testing site. Read self-test package inserts thoroughly and follow the instructions closely when performing the test.

If you do not have symptoms but have been exposed to COVID-19, wait at least 5 full days after your exposure before taking a test. - If you are only going to take a single test, a PCR test will provide a more reliable negative test result. - If you use an antigen test, a positive result is reliable, but a negative test is not always accurate. - If your antigen test is negative, take another antigen test after 48 hours or take a PCR test as soon as you can. - If your second antigen test is also negative, wait another 48 hours and test a third time. Testing can be helpful even when you don't have symptoms or a recent exposure to COVID-19, such as before an event or visiting someone at higher risk. Test as close to the time of the event as possible (at least within 1-2 days) to help you make informed decisions about your health and your risk of spreading COVID-19 to others. If you use an antigen test, follow recommendations for repeat testing to be confident in a negative result. Additionally, some places may test people without symptoms or a recent exposure to help keep COVID-19 from spreading to others, especially those who are at [higher risk for severe illness](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/risks-getting-very-sick.html). You may choose a PCR or antigen test. If you use an antigen test and your result is negative, repeat testing following [FDA recommendations](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/safety-communications/home-covid-19-antigen-tests-take-steps-reduce-your-risk-false-negative-results-fda-safety). 30 days or less I have symptoms Use an antigen test. Repeat negative tests following [FDA recommendations](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/safety-communications/home-covid-19-antigen-tests-take-steps-reduce-your-risk-false-negative-results-fda-safety). I do not have symptoms Testing is not recommended to detect a new infection. 31-90 days I have symptoms Use an antigen test. Repeat negative tests following [FDA recommendations](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/safety-communications/home-covid-19-antigen-tests-take-steps-reduce-your-risk-false-negative-results-fda-safety). I do not have symptoms Use an antigen test. Repeat negative tests following [FDA recommendations](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/safety-communications/home-covid-19-antigen-tests-take-steps-reduce-your-risk-false-negative-results-fda-safety). After a positive test result, you may continue to test positive for some time. Some tests, especially PCR tests, may continue to show a positive result for up to 90 days. [Reinfections](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/reinfection.html) can occur within 90 days, which can make it hard to know if a positive test indicates a new infection. Consider consulting a healthcare provider if you have any questions or concerns about your circumstances. Getting a COVID-19 Test Buy self-tests (at-home tests) Buy [self-tests (at-home tests)](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing/self-testing.html) online or in pharmacies and retail stores. Private health insurance may reimburse the cost of purchasing self-tests. Visit [FDA's website](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/coronavirus-covid-19-and-medical-devices/home-otc-covid-19-diagnostic-tests?utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdelivery#list) for a list of authorized tests. Self-tests are antigen tests. Go to a testing location - Visit a [community-based testing location](https://www.hhs.gov/coronavirus/community-based-testing-sites/index.html), such as a pharmacy or [health center](https://findahealthcenter.hrsa.gov/)near you. These locations may offer PCR or antigen tests, and provide low- or no-cost testing for everyone, including people without insurance. Free PCR or antigen tests may also be available through your [local health department](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/hd-search/). - Talk to a doctor or healthcare provider about other testing options that may be available to you. - If you are a person with a disability, the [Disability Information and Access Line](https://acl.gov/DIAL)can help you access a test or find a test location. Interpreting Your Results Positive Any positive COVID-19 test means the virus was detected and you have or recently had an infection. [Isolate](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/isolation.html)and take precautions, including wearing a [high-quality mask or respirator](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/types-of-masks.html), to protect others around you from getting infected. - Tell people you had recent contact with that they [may have been exposed](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/if-you-were-exposed.html). - Monitor your [symptoms](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html). If you have any [emergency warning signs](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html#seek-medical-attention), seek emergency care immediately. - Contact a healthcare provider, [community health center](https://data.hrsa.gov/data/reports/datagrid?gridName=FQHCs), or pharmacy to learn about [treatment options](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/treatments-for-severe-illness.html)that may be available to you. Treatment must be started within the first few days to be effective. - You are more likely to get very sick if you are an older adult or have an underlying medical condition. [Treatment](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/treatments-for-severe-illness.html)is available. Talk with your healthcare provider to determine what is the best option for you. - You are more likely to get very sick if you are an older adult or have an underlying medical condition. Negative A negative COVID-19 test means the test did not detect the virus, but this doesn't rule out that you could have an infection. If you used an antigen test, follow [FDA recommendations for repeat testing](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/safety-communications/home-covid-19-antigen-tests-take-steps-reduce-your-risk-false-negative-fda-safety-communication). - If you have symptoms: - You may have COVID-19 but tested before the virus was detectable. - Consider that you may have another viral infection or illness that you need to get tested for. For many diseases, including [flu](/flu/symptoms/index.html), early diagnosis and prompt treatment is very important for preventing severe illness. - Take [everyday preventive actions](/nonpharmaceutical-interventions/personal/index.html)to prevent spreading an illness to others. - Contact a healthcare provider if you have any questions about your test result or if your symptoms worsen. - If you do not have symptoms but were [exposed](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/risks-exposure.html)to the virus that causes COVID-19, you should continue to take [recommended steps after exposure](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/if-you-were-exposed.html). - If you do not have symptoms and have not been exposed to the virus that causes COVID-19, you may return to normal activities. - Continue to take steps to [protect yourself and others](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html), including monitoring for symptoms. Get tested again if symptoms appear. - Continue to take steps to Testing for Antibodies Antibody tests detect antibodies that your body makes to fight the virus that causes COVID-19. [Antibody tests](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/testing/antibody-tests-guidelines.html) should never be used to diagnose a current infection with the virus that causes COVID-19. An antibody test may not show if you have a current infection, because it can take 1 to 3 weeks after the infection for your body to make antibodies. Antibody tests can be used for [public health surveillance](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/testing-overview.html#PublicHealthSurveillance) or to test for [conditions](/mis/index.html) associated with COVID-19.
