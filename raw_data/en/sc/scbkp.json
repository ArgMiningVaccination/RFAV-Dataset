Of destiny. Of nothing better than being in love on Orcas Island. I wonder, who writes these screenplays we call our lives? If I were to read ours I might think, great storytelling! It was 1999 and John spent two weeks in Reigoldswil, near Gempen, near Dornach, near Basel, Switzerland. He was with a handful of others studying with Marshall Rosenberg who had recognized some amazing things about the human encounter and called his work Nonviolent Communication (NVC). John was on fire about NVC and the connections with Anthroposophy that were beginning to reveal themselves to him. After 13 years of classroom teaching in a Waldorf School, he left the classroom to support the movement by spending the next eleven years sharing this unfolding understanding in Waldorf Schools all over the US, New Zealand, and Australia. It was 2005 and Cat spent two weeks in Reigoldswil, near Gempen, near Dornach, near Basel Switzerland. She was with 55 people from 21 different countries studying how to apply NVC to social activism with Marshall Rosenberg. Cat was excited about the connections between NVC and Playback Theatre, which she had been involved with for 12 years; she saw the underlying support for the development of empathy in each. She spent the next five years bringing NVC into various venues, including prisons, schools and business, along with sharing parts of Playback Theatre to enliven the practice of NVC. It was 2010. Cat had ended a successful ten year stint selling Real Estate in Seattle, she wondered what was next. She saw that Dominic Barter was coming to Seattle to share his Restorative Circle Process (RC). (Dominic had been in Basel in 2005, and as a field trip, Cat went with a group from the NVC Social Activism work to spend an evening with him and learn about RC). Cat was giving herself 9 months to attend workshops and conferences involved with improv, Playback, NVC and now Restorative Circle Process; a believer in life as an adventure, she wanted to see what and who would show up that would point towards her next steps. It was 2010. John was in between trips to Australia where he was sharing his NVC/Anthroposophy extensively in Steiner Schools. He had been involved with an RC practice group and was excited at the opportunity to train directly with Dominic in Seattle. Maybe you already see where this is going. The first two days of the training consisted of Dominic giving an overview of how the development of the work had occurred. I stayed in the periphery of the large basement room in the church that hosted the training. I stretched, listened, stretched some more; sitting is hard for me. John sat in the second row, he took copious notes. He noticed Cat \"prowling around the edges of the room like a panther\"... I didn't notice him, well, I sort of noticed him. It was the morning of day three. I brought in a rebounder and a hula hoop, thinking that movement choices would be a good thing for everyone! John brought his mat\u00e9 gourd. At break, he stood backlit, against a floor to ceiling window. Now I definitely noticed him. I leaned over to my friend Janice, \"who is that guy over there with the mat\u00e9 gourd?\"... \"How can you not know John Cunningham?!?\" she asked incredulously!?! Then she enumerated the seemingly countless places our paths should have crossed. Including taking NVC and Mindfulness trainings into the prison system with Lucy Leu and Freedom Project. Now I remembered seeing John's name on the advisory board for Freedom Project, a non-profit that worked in the prison and with people returning to life on the outside. I had been on the board, been on the inside offering training and had helped with fundraising with my Playback Theatre Troupe. I silently laughed as I remembered thinking, in a british accent, \"hmmmm, John Cunningham, he sounds a bit stuffy, probably wears a three piece suit\". Here he was, in the flesh, yes, he did have a vest on... Walking directly up to John, I reached out my hand to shake his saying \"hi, my name's Cat Gilliam. I think we are supposed to know each other!\". John always counters this, when we share our story, with, \"what she actually said is, my name is Cat Gilliam. I fall in love with everyone and you're next\"! What we discover over the next nine years together is a journey of love and the mystery of destiny... After living in Seattle, on Orcas Island, and doing lots of travel for work, we spent two years in Hudson NY, an Anthroposophical center of initiatives; Biodynamic farming, four Camphills, a large K-12 Waldorf school, The Nature Institute and more! In November of 2015, a group of Anthroposophical doctors, earth-healers, a craniosacral practitioner and a eurythmist came to Hudson as part of a trip around the US. I mentioned this to John and suggested he see the orthopedic surgeon to see if he had any insight into the itchy achy feeling in his hip. John ended up seeing the internist instead, who proceeded to listen to his organs with his stethoscope for about thirty minutes! He also had a craniosacral session and a eurythmy session. They met together and then shared with us the conclusion that John had a very cold kidney process and would benefit from some Mistletoe treatment. What the group of practitioners from Germany were noticing was prostate cancer. It was officially diagnosed eight months later. We then began to work with many different substances to \"kill the cancer\". Nothing conventional except the diagnostic tools of PSA, scans, and regular blood work. We were open to what conventional medicine could offer that made sense to us. Nothing did. Fast forward to November 2017. John and I moved to Asheville NC where he took on the full time \"part time\" job as Faculty Coordinator of a small young Waldorf school. We thought it would be wonderful to both plant the seeds of restorative culture and be there to tend to the healthy growing. (What actually happened there is a tragic story- but not the one I am now telling.) In December, four months into this new position, John's stamina was decreasing and he was having disturbing and distracting pain in his coccyx. We checked in with several physicians. An Anthroposophical doctor, a lead doctor at Johns Hopkins, and a local Functional Medicine doctor. After digesting what they each shared with us regarding options, we choose to head to an Anthroposophical Clinic in Unterlengenhardt, Germany in January 2018; A tiny village above Bad Liebenzell. ( [https://www.paracelsus-krankenhaus.de/](https://www.paracelsus-krankenhaus.de/)) And if you love hot water, the Germans really know how to do Spa's! Check out the one in Bad Liebenzell! After two weeks of a myriad of treatments, we left with John feeling ever so much better. Stronger, pain free and uplifted. As we had both had spent time at Marshall Rosenberg's Swiss retreat center-Orchidea, we decided to add a short visit to Dornach so we could visit the Goetheanum, and Orchidea. John also had the thought to reach out to Thomas and Franziska, who had been the two earth healers who had organized the group John had met with back in Hudson NY, 2015, as they lived in Dornach. In meeting with them, (they just happened to have come back from a trip the day before I emailed), we felt the angels at work. Love and Destiny. Franziska is both a healer and a clairvoyant. She spoke to John about his habits and his cancer. They treated us as long lost dearest of friends. They offered us two more weeks of paid treatment at a private Anthroposophical Clinic in Trav\u00ebmunde, north of L\u00fcberg on the Baltic Sea. Dr. Lars Ulrich Costa-Rosa- LU as he is lovingly called-would treat John daily, and we could stay in an apartment above the clinic! LU was one of the doctors who saw John back in 2015 in Hudson! After Thomas and Franziska contacted LU, he traveled from Trav\u00ebmunde to Dornach the next day, a full day's journey, to see John in person. This to determine if he would be able to help him. LU certainly raised the bar for physicians/healers. He exuded love and warmth and connected so deeply with John over the 1 1/2 hours he spent with us. At the end of this time he said, yes. Come. The two weeks in Trav\u00ebmunde were as strengthening and healing as the first two at the clinic in the Black Forest. I learned how to do IV's. Absolutely a miracle in itself, being the most needle phobic person I knew. LU had a way of seeing into each of us that stays with me still. His unshakeable belief that I could do it enabled me. Upon returning to Asheville in February, we embarked upon quite a schedule of treatments for John. Mistletoe IV's, oil dispersion baths, ozone tent treatments, large handfuls of supplements to support the immune system, detox and kill the cancer. We added juicing fresh raw cannabis with no psychotropic reaction. Homeopathic injections, curative eurythmy. I'm sure I've forgotten half of what we did. By November John's stamina was again declining and the tremendous stress of the job was taking a toll. We left to both support and get support from my mom. John loves to say he joined generation X and moved in with his girlfriend's mother. He's a very funny guy. December 2018 took us to a different clinic in Germany. January to Orcas Island to be with family and friends. Perhaps John was beginning to live his dying. We added an unexpected trip to LA to meet with an oncologist we hoped might work miracles. John's prostate cancer was aggressive and all of what we had done, though keeping him strong, hadn't terminated the cancer; it was progressing. With barely a beginning of this new chemo regimen, John ended up hospitalised for one week with mini-strokes, pulmonary embolisms and heart stress. Three days after we got out of the hospital and back to my Mom's, I took her to the emergency room. Colon cancer. At 89, she weathered the surgery well but not the ensuing 5 months of chemo. We kept her home on Hospice and on October 14th, she died. (see Belongings/Belonging/Be Longing) Now, here we are, January 2020 back on Orcas. Done with allopathic medicine, big Pharma and the tremendous toll it was taking on his well-being John just wanted to come home. Home to a daughter, old friends and the healing beauty of this island. This September will be the ten year anniversary of our first trip here together, when John joyfully proclaimed to the bright blue sky, golden sunlight, and whomever happened to cross our path, nothing better than being in love on Orcas Island! John is, as his Hospice nurse says, an outlier. Over the past 4 years he has risen over and over again from what appears to be living his dying. I've nicknamed him Phoenix. He appears closer to the end then ever before, one day saying \"I think I am beginning to live my dying\", then two days later changing his mind. It's his prerogative. It's a wild ride not knowing from day to day. He may not be here to celebrate that ten year anniversary. We have come full circle. Profound mystery and enduring love still the music we dance to. This verse by Rudolf Steiner speaks to all of this: The wishes of the soul are springing The deeds of the will are thriving The fruits of life are maturing I feel my destiny My destiny finds me I feel my star My star finds me I feel my goals in life My goals in life are finding me My soul and the great world are one Life grows more radiant about me Life grows more challenging for me Life grows more abundant within me. I am living with a tremendous grieving and a deep gratitude and reverence for this decade of my life. "}
