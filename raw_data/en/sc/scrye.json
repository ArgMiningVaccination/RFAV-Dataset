Keen to understand more about vaccinations? We've got you covered with everything you need to know, from why they're important to those you can get at our community pharmacies. Vaccines are a safe and easy way to protect yourself against harmful diseases. They are usually given by injection and they work by helping your immune system to develop natural defences (antibodies) to a disease. So when you encounter the disease you already have the antibodies to protect yourself. Vaccinations are a quick, effective and safe way to protect yourself against diseases that can damage your health. As well as protecting yourself, vaccines also prevent you from passing a disease on to other people, limiting the spread of the disease and protecting the community.
