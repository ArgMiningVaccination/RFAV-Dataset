We regularly use essential oils when treating patients, and the power in just one drop can be life-changing. Why do we use Essential Oils? Their power to effect physical and emotional change is tremendous, and in many cases can be more rapid than anything else. After studying the science behind their use and witnessing the deep way they act in the body, it becomes clear that these little bottles of aromatic liquids are more potent than they seem. What are Essential Oils? Essential oils are the aromatic liquid extracts from plants. Plants use the oils to serve as both protection and communication. They have a small molecular structure, which allows them to pass into cells, and the biochemical effect can bring about physical and emotional healing. How can you use Essential Oils? There are many ways they can be effectively and safely utilised for the benefit of your pets: - Diffusing oils in a pet's environment can effect their emotions, helping to calm stressed or anxious animals, and also have physical effects (they purify the air after an anal gland expression for example!) - Petting applications, where a few drops of selected oils are rubbed between your palms and then applied to the animal by petting, stroking the ears, or a during massage session - Using them topically, in solutions or ointments prepared specifically for your pet (view our range of products in our [online store](https://www.thenaturalvets.com.au/product-category/essential-oils/)) - Internally, by adding to drinking water, food, administering directly into the mouth, or in capsules (NOT WITHOUT VETERINARY DIRECTION) Common oils we use include lavender, melaleuca, helichrysum and frankincense, as well as some doTERRA blends - Purify and On Guard are clinic favourites, as well as the emotional blends - Balance for calming, and Console during a euthanasia goodbye. We prefer to allow animals to SELF-SELECT oils wherever possible, meaning we will offer different bottles of oils and monitor the pet's response to determine which oils are accepted and likely to be beneficial for that pet. Essential Oil Safety Not all essential oils are safe to use in animals. Some oils can cause harm, especially when incorrectly prescribed, administered by inappropriate routes, or if poor quality oils are used. Certain oils are more likely to cause reactions, for example oregano and cinnamon oil and some citrus oils. We use only certified therapeutic grade essential oils in our practice and encourage anyone wanting to use essential oils on their pets to seek veterinary advice first from a vet experienced in their application. Therapeutic grade oils are very potent and have immense power to heal, but depending on concentration, quality, selection and application method also have the potential to harm. There are no organisations that regulate or certify 'therapeutic grade' oils, and so when using oils that are marketed as therapeutic grade, it is up to the consumer to check that internal and third-party testing as well as independent audits are being carried out. With doTERRA we have found that they achieve what they have set out to do - produce the best quality oils in the world for health and wellness outcomes. It is important that oils chosen for pets are of the highest grade and purity as contaminants can potentially be highly toxic. Our Holistic Vets have experience prescribing essential oils for specific conditions and can advise you how to safely use essential oils in your home and on your pet for optimal health and well-being. We base much of our work on that of Dr Melissa Shelton DVM, who has been using essential oils in practice for many years and continues to perform numerous studies proving their efficacy and safety when used appropriately.
