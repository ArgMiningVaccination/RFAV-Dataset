The sensation elicited by the needle, unlike the pain associated with a hypodermic injection, often amounts to a slight sting. Once in place, the needle may be manipulated to obtain a sensation described as a feeling of heaviness, fullness, or achiness. This reaction indicates that the needle is affecting the body's internal energy.
