RIVM, P.O. Box 1, 3720 BA telephone: 31 - 30 - 274 91 11; telefax: 31 - 30 - 274 29 71 page 2 of 163 RIVM report 270091004 Abstract Economic evaluation of p revention: further evidence This report is the third in a se ries of reports that aim to id entify cost-effective preventive interventions that have not yet been diffused into the Dutch health care system or into a public health setting. In the first part of this report, five new in terventions are presented and at the same time, renew the information on cost-effectiveness and implementation issues for six interventions that were described in less de tail in our first report. For al l eleven interventions, brief information on the magnitude and character of the health problem is presented, along with information on the intervention, its cost-effectivene ss, and issues related to the transferability of foreign study results to the Dutch situati on and possible future implementation of the intervention in the Netherlands. There is st rong evidence for cost-effectiveness for (1) screening for neonatal group beta streptococcal in fections, (2) fluoridati on of drinking water, (3) mandatory folic acid fortifi cation of staple foods, (4) vaccin ation against varicella zoster virus and (5) stop smoking interventions. Eviden ce on cost-effectiveness is moderate for (6) influenza vaccination of healthy working adults , (7) rotavirus vaccina tion of newborns, (8) universal hepatitis B vaccination, (9) pertus sis vaccination of adol escents, (10) human papilomavirus vaccination of adolescents, a nd (11) pneumococcal vaccination of elderly persons. However, for all interventions, we concl ude that the transferability of the results to the Dutch situation is poor and more research is needed to investigate cost-effectiveness in the Dutch context. With respect to implemen tation opportunities, it is anticipated that screening for neonatal group beta streptoco ccal infections, pertu ssis vaccination of adolescents, influenza vaccination of healt hy working adults and pneumococcal vaccination of elderly persons is feasible. In the second part of this report, the cost-effectiveness was modelled for two interventions that were shown to be cost-effective in an in ternational context and had no major barriers for implementation in the Netherlands. The two inte rventions were the prevention of recurrent depression by maintenance cognitive behaviour al therapy (mCBT), and the prevention of chronic diseases by pharmacologic treatment of obesity. The analyses showed that mCBT is more cost-effective than usua l care, which is prescription of anti-depressive medication. Compared to usual care, mCBT has a cost -effectiveness ratio of \u20ac 15,000 per QALY. The cost-effectiveness of providing pharmacologic treat ment (Orlistat) in combination with a diet is relatively high. Costs per QALY gained are \u20ac 62,000 for Orlistat plus diet compared to diet alone. The modelling study underlin es the importance of performing Dutch specific cost- effectiveness analyses and confirms the low tr ansferability of foreign studies to the Dutch situation as was shown in th e first part of the report.

This report is the third RIVM report that is aimed at the identification of preventive interventions that might be of interest for future Dutch public health policies, in a sens e that it is anticipated that health benefits are achieved within a peri od of five years at an acceptable level of cost- effectiveness. Two previous reports identifie d 18 (Dirkmaat et al., 2003) and 10 (Vijgen et al., 2005) of such interventions. The two prev ious reports have s timulated and renewed interest in the issue of cost-effectiveness of prevention. Among others, these reports were used as input for two national meetings on the cost-effectiven ess of prevention. The current report builds on the pr evious two reports. We have updated the information from the 2003 report and additionally, we have a dded evidence on the cost -effectiveness of five preventive interventions that have not been pointed out in one of the previous reports. Relatively to the two previous reports, we focu s more on issues related to the implementation of the interventions in the Netherlands. Furthe rmore, we have tenta tively modelled the costs and effects of implementation of two preventi ve interventions at population level. These interventions were identified in the previous report (V ijgen et al., 2005). For the purpose of our study, we have intervie wed Dutch experts in the field of prevention. We kindly thank these experts (l isted in Appendix 5) for their collaboration and for critical feed-back on draft chapters of this on previous versions of this report. Ingeborg Bovendeur from the Center for Public Health Forecasting contributed to data gathering for part B of this report. Many colleagues from the Center for Public Health Forecasti ng and the Center for Prevention and Health Services Research provided with critical feed-back on drafts of this report. We thank all of the above for their contributions to our work. Finally, we would like to thank Dr Theo Vos from the University of Queensland for providing the necessary data to build the depression simulation model. One final remark concerns the intensive coope ration with those RIVM colleagues who work on the annual report series on developments w ithin the National Immunization Programme in the Netherlands. As a coincidental finding, 7 out of 11 promising interventions we describe in the current report appear to be vaccinations for prevention of infectious diseases. In our report, we focus on cost-effectiveness and feas ibility of implementation of the vaccination, while their report focuses on all relevant developments with regard to these vaccinations. Hence, their focus is much broader. For a more complete picture of all relevant aspects of the vaccinations concerned, we refer to their report in the relevant parts of our current report.

RIVM report 270091004 page 15 of 163 Summary This report is the third in a se ries of reports that aim to id entify cost-effective preventive interventions that have not yet been diffused into the Dutch health care system or into a public health setting. The aim of the research was: to identify further preventive interventions with evidence on cost-effectiveness from at least three good quality economic evaluations; to make an update on the interventions that were previously de scribed (Dirkmaat et al., 2003) using the more strict criteria on evidence; to describe the transferability of the resu lts to the Dutch situation and implementation issues. to model the cost-effectiveness of nation-wide implementation in the Netherlands of two interventions with a good cost-effectiveness profile that also appear to be without major implementation problems. This report contains two parts. In the first part (Part A) five new interventions are presented and renew the information on cost-effectiv eness and implementation issues of six interventions that were describe d in less detail in the first repo rt. In the second part (Part B) the cost-effectiveness of two interventions are modelled assuming they will be implemented in the Netherlands. These interventions are: the prevention of recurrent depression by maintenance cognitive behavioural therapy, a nd the prevention of ch ronic diseases by pharmacologic treatment of obesity. These inte rventions were assumed not to have major barriers for implementation, and their cost-eff ectiveness has not yet been modelled in the Netherlands. PART A Cost-effective preven tive interventions There is strong evidence for cost-effectivene ss based on internationally literature for: (1) screening for neonatal group be ta streptococcal infections (2) fluoridation of drinking wa ter (update previous report) (3) mandatory folic acid fortification of staple foods (update previous report) (4) vaccination against varicella zost er virus (update previous report) (5) stop smoking interventions (update previous report) (6) influenza vaccination of healthy working adults (update previous report) Evidence for cost-effectiveness is moderate for: (7) rotavirus vaccination of newborns (8) universal hepatitis B vaccination (9) pertussis vaccination of adolescents (10) human papilomavirus vaccination of adolescents (11) pneumococcal vaccination of elderl y persons (update previous report). For all interventions it is concluded that the tran sferability of the results to the Dutch situation is poor and more research is needed to inves tigate cost-effectiveness in the Dutch context. With respect to implementation opportunities, it is anticipated that screening for neonatal page 16 of 163 RIVM report 270091004 group beta streptococcal infections, pertus sis vaccination of adol escents, stop smoking interventions, influenza vaccina tion of healthy working adults and pneumococcal vaccination of elderly persons is feasible . For the other interventions some or major implementation barriers are described. Below the cost-effectiveness of the 11 interventions is summarized. Screening for neonatal group beta streptococcal infections About 2 in 1,000 newborns develop early-onse t group beta streptococcal disease (GBS). Prevention of this disease starts with identify ing pregnant women at risk of transmitting GBS to their offspring. Four differe nt strategies for this selection were proposed: risk-based strategy, screening-based strate gy, combination strategy, and th e Dutch strategy. The current Dutch strategy in the prevention of GBS dis ease seems to be not cost-effective. The combination strategy seems the most cost-eff ective (< \u20ac 10,000/QALY) and feasible method to implement as prevention strategy for GBS in the Netherlands. Rotavirus vaccination of newborns Rotaviruses are the most common cause of seve re watery diarrheal di sease in infants and young children. Several economic evaluations concl ude that rotavirus vaccination would be cost-neutral or even cost-saving. Although th ese results are based on data on the former vaccine Rotashield \u00ae, the results are expected to be gene rally applicable to two new vaccines that recently became available (RotaRix\u00ae and RotaTeq\u00ae). Cost-effectiveness of vaccination is probably lower in the Netherlands because the in cidence of rotavirus is lower, vaccine costs are higher and work absence of parents is less than assumed in foreign studies. Mass rotavirus vaccination could be relatively easy implem ented in the Netherlands, but it remains questionable whether this vaccine is acceptable to parents who perceive a rotavirus infection to be a relatively innocent disease. Fluoridation of drinking water Fluoridation of drinking water in the Netherlands would probably be cost-saving as the costs of fluoridation will be outweighed by the savings due to reduction of caries. However, people would also run the risk of fluorosis. Alt hough practically feasible, the many objections against fluoridation of dri nking water make its implementation rather improbable. Mandatory folic acid fortif ication of staple foods Economic evaluations in the literature suggest th at mandatory folic acid fortification of staple foods in the Netherlands is probably cost-sav ing with regard to th e prevention of NTDs. However, recent evidence on other favourable and harmful effects of folic acid was not included in the economic evaluations. Further resear ch is needed to gain more insight into the diverse effects of folic acid. Such a risk-benef it analysis should be the basis of future comprehensive economic evaluations of mandatory folic acid fortification and supplementation. Vaccination against varicella zoster virus Based on international literature it is expected that the introduc tion of varicella vaccination in the Dutch National Immunization Programme (NIP) could be cost-effective from a healthcare payer perspective and possibly ev en cost-saving from a societal perspective. Nevertheless, the actual cost-effectiveness depends on several as pects that are still uncertain at the moment. These factors include the actual burden of di sease caused by chickenpox in the Netherlands, and the effect of varicella vaccination on zoster incidence, and on MMR coverage. RIVM report 270091004 page 17 of 163 Stop smoking interventions In the Netherlands, smoking is the risk factor th at is associated with the highest burden of disease. Smoking increases the risk of many diseases, such as lung cancer and COPD. The examined studies conclude that smoking cessation interventions, either GP counselling alone, or GP counselling in combination with nicotine replacement therapy would be cost-effective. Less evidence was found for GP counselling in combination with Bupropion. A concern with respect to the transferability of the results from foreign studies to the Dutch situation is that the reference scenarios do not exactly reflec t the Dutch situation. Implementation of GP counselling aiming at smoking cessation in the Ne therlands will not be difficult. However, the effectiveness depends to a large extent on the efforts of GPs and on compliance of smokers. Influenza vaccination of healthy working adults Although complications of in fluenza infections are uncommon among healthy working adults, infections result in si gnificant burden of illness, especi ally in terms of absenteeism from work. Most studies conclude that vaccinatio n will lead to cost-savings when the societal perspective is chosen. Economic benefits hi ghly depend on the number of workers that choose for vaccination, the actual match for th e season, the virulence of the circulating strains, and the degree of absenteeism and produc tivity losses due to infl uenza infections. In practice, it will not be difficult to offer v accination to healthy working adults in the Netherlands. However, vaccination coverage is always strongly associated with perceptions of the severity of disease, and since influenza is in general not perceived to be a serious health threat, one can expect that this will also be the case for influenza vaccination. Universal hepatitis B vaccination Hepatitis B is a contagious vira l infection. In the Netherlands th e prevalence of hepatitis B is generally low, but higher among some risk groups (homosexuals, prostitutes, drug users) and some immigrant groups. Because of the very low endemicity, the Dutch government decided not to implement universal vaccination, but to implement risk-based prevention policies, including vaccination of risk-g roups. Evidence is inconclusi ve on cost-effectiveness of preventive policies in low-endemic areas, but it seems that vaccination of adolescents and the vaccination of infants are both co st-effective. However, it seems that the cost-effectiveness of universal hepatitis B vaccination is relate d to the way it possibly will be implemented. Because it is undesirable to give more than tw o different vaccinations at one moment, it will be necessary to use the commercially available combination (DTP-IPV-HepB-Hib) vaccine for newborns, as currently implemented for thos e newborns who are at risk for hepatitis B infection. Universal vaccination of adolescents would require the introd uction of an entirely different age group within the NIP. Pertussis vaccinati on of adolescents Pertussis vaccination of adolescents - aiming to prevent pertussis in both infants and adolescents - appears to be cost -effective. However, there are uncertainties in the estimates of the true incidence of pertussis morbidity, tr ansmission routes and the extent of herd immunity. The cost-effectiveness ratios range from cost-saving to \u20ac 186,000 per life year gained depending on the level of herd immun ity assumed. An ongoing study investigating the cost-effectiveness in the Netherlands will result in more conclusive information. Additional information about disease incidence, vaccine efficacy, and vaccine adverse events would contribute to a future policy decision a bout implementation of this vaccine. page 18 of 163 RIVM report 270091004 Human papilomavirus vaccination of adolescents HPV vaccination of female pre-adolescents is possibly cost-effective, although not all interventions as found in the st udies appeared to be cost-eff ective. The cost-effectiveness ratios of the interventions that were range from \u20ac 12,225 to \u20ac 24,152 per QALY gained. Nearly all the existing cost-effectiv eness results appeared to be sensitive to the age at which vaccination is given, v accine efficacy, vaccine price and duration of protection. More research is n eeded on those factors, as well as on the cost-effectiveness of HPV vaccination in men. The impact of the vaccination on the frequency of screening is important. Based on currently availa ble (international) data it can be concluded that universal HPV vaccination of pre-adolescent girls in th e Netherlands will only be cost-effective under certain base case assumptions. The feasibility of implementation of HPV vaccination in the Netherlands depends among others on the price of the vaccine and the knowledge of parents and adolescents about the importance of vaccination and screening. Furthermore, it is important to find the best way of providing th e vaccine to adolescents in optimalizing the compliance among them. Pneumococcal vaccination of elderly persons A bacterial infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae causes noninvasive infections and invasive diseases such as meningitis, septicaemia and pneumonia, generally associated with bacteremia. Cost-effectiveness of varies from cost-saving to \u20ac 31,000 per QALY. Cost-effectiveness rates improve with higher age of the target group. There are several threats to the transferability of foreign study results to the Dutch situation: a lower incidence of invasive diseases caused by pneumococci and th e feasible interdependency between influenza vaccination and pneumococcal vaccination. It will not be difficult to implement pneumococcal vaccination in the Netherlands. Ho wever, it may be that vaccination against pneumococcal disease influences the in fluenza vaccination coverage degree. Economic evaluation and policy making The information presented in the report is meant to support future decision making on the implementation of the interven tions. However, such decision making is not only based on the cost-effectiveness but also on other aspects. Th ese aspects include e.g. total budget impact of the intervention, equity consider ations and disease impact, both at the national level (DALY loss associated with the disease) and at individua l level. Hence, cost-effectiveness is only one element in the decision making process, but not an unimportant one. In the study only interventions were listed that have at least three good quali ty economic evaluations showing cost-effectiveness (defined as cost per QALY of maxima l \u20ac 20,000). Although this is informative with regard to future decision making on the nation-wide implementation of one or more of these interventions, this focus on co st-effective interventions results in more or less ignoring the knowledge of which interven tions are less cost-eff ective or even cost- ineffective. Such knowledge could also be in formative for health policy makers, either because it makes clear that some interventions should not be introduced or that existing interventions should become redundant. Furthermore, the reports, so far, have gained insight into cost-effectiveness, transferability and im plementation aspects of interventions, but there is no priority with respect to importance of implementation in the Dutch healthcare or public health system. This information w ould be helpful for policy makers. Cost-effectiveness primarily known in the area of disease prevention As in previous reports, disease prevention is the area that was evalua ted best with regard to its cost-effectiveness. Out of the eleven interventions described in detail in this report, eight interventions are from the disease prevention ar ea (mainly vaccinations), two from the health RIVM report 270091004 page 19 of 163 protection area (fluoridation of drinking water and folic acid for tification of staple foods) and one stems from the health promotion ar ea (stop smoking interventions). No single intervention was identified from the 'intersector al policy' area. A decision to implement new vaccines in the National Immunization Progr amme is a complicated one. Besides the considerations that are key in any implementatio n decision on preventive interventions, such as budgetary consequences and disease impact, some very specific questions have to be answered satisfactorily before new vaccine s can be introduced in the Netherlands. PART B Modelling effect of two interventions In part B of this report the cost-effectiven ess was modelled for prevention of recurrent depression by maintenance cognitive behaviour al therapy (mCBT), and the prevention of chronic diseases by pharmacologic treatment of obesity. These interventions were assumed not to have major barriers for implementa tion, and their cost-effectiveness was proved internationally but not nationally. Maintenance cognitive behavioural therapy (mCBT) The main conclusion of the cost-effectiveness st udy of mCBT was that health gains can be achieved at a low cost if the GP refers pers ons diagnosed with major depression to mCBT instead of prescribing anti-depr essive medication. Both in a cohort of people just recovered from a depressive episode and in a mixed popul ation (with different periods since recovery) ICER fall below the threshold of \u20ac 20,000 per QALY gained. Someone who has just recovered from a depressive epis ode receives mCBT instead of usual care he/she gains on average about 0.10 QALY over a period of five year s with at an additional cost of about \u20ac 500 resulting in an average cost-effectiven ess ratio of \u20ac 5,000 per QALY gained. In the mixed population the health gains are somewh at lower and a patient on average gains 0.05 QALY over a period of five years at highe r costs resulting in a mean ICER of \u20ac 15,000 per QALY gained. This conclusion should be howe ver be interpreted with caution, since a lot of parameters in the model are based on inte rnational studies while some important model parameters, like adherence to trea tments, should be preferably be based on Dutch data and, as in any modelling study, some simplif ying assumptions were made. Orlistat in combination with diet The cost-effectiveness ratio of providing Orlistat in combination with a diet is relatively high, eventhough diet alone results in less health gain. Costs per QALY gained are \u20ac 18,000 for diet compared to no care and \u20ac 62,000 of diet pl us Orlistat compared to diet. Compared to previous studies, the modelling exercise re veals a higher cost-effectiveness ratio for the treatment of obesity thro ugh a diet in combination with Orlis tat. This is partly due to the assumption used in this model about the eff ectiveness on interventions on BMI in the long term. In this study it was assumed that 20% of the weight loss was maintained in the long run. If this relapse was not taken into account, costs would be s ubstantially lower: \u20ac 8,000 per QALY gained for diet only and \u20ac 24,000 per QAL Y gained for diet in combination with Orlistat . It was shown that l onger and active follow up can prev ent weight regain. However, this would involve additional cost s and thus it is difficult to h ypothesize to what extent this would influence cost-effectiveness. The modelling studies underline the importa nce of performing Dutch specific cost- effectiveness analyses and confirm the low tran sferability of foreign studies to the Dutch situation as was shown in th e first part of the study. page 20 of 163 RIVM report 270091004 RIVM report 270091004 page 21 of 163 Part A: Identification of cost-effective preventive interventions page 22 of 163 RIVM report 270091004 RIVM report 270091004 page 23 of 163 1. Introduction 1.1 The cost-effectiveness of prevention Decision makers at multiple levels need inform ation on the evidence base of prevention. Such information should assist in decision making on implementation of and prioritization between the possible candidate interven tions for public health funding or for reimbursement through health care insurance. Evidence may concern effectiveness or cost-effectiveness of the intervention, but also related subjects such as impact on the total he alth care budget and the burden of disease. Although many (existing) prev entive interventions have at present not yet been evaluated for effectiveness and cost-e ffectiveness (De Wit a nd Brouwer, 2004), the evidence base is growing in recent years. Following developments in evidence-base medicine, a similar movement towards the prac tice of evidence-based public health has emerged recently (Maibach et al., 2006). Internati onally, this is reflected in the publication of guidelines (Guide to community preventive se rvices, 2006; US Preventive Services Task Force, 1996) comprehensive research reports (Gol dsmith et al., 2004) and systematic reviews of the literature, including meta-analyses (publ ished, among others, in the Cochrane database and NHS-Economic Evaluation Database). In the Netherlands, both th e Health Council (Gezondheidsraad ) and the Council for Public Health and Health Care (Raad voor de Volksg ezondheid en Zorg) have stated that cost- effectiveness and disease burden should play a role in decision making on reimbursement of health care (Gezondheidsraad, 2003; Raad voor de Volksgezondheid en Zorg, 2006). The most prominent example of actual use of ec onomic evaluations in health care decision making can be found in the selective reimburseme nt of new pharmaceuticals. Within the field of prevention, examples of the use of econom ic evidence for instance can be found at the introduction of expensive national public he alth programmes, such as cancer screening programmes and new vaccines within the National Immunization Programme. At the same time, many preventive programme s are introduced that lack ev idence on their effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. This is especially true for health promotion programmes, for health protection, for healthy public policies (health in all policies) and for local preventive programmes (Goldsmith et al., 2004; Vijgen et al., 2005; De Wit and Schuit, 2006). While acknowledging that many prev entive interventions at presen ce have not been evaluated with regard to effects and costs, it remains important to identify those preventive programmes that are worthwile investments, in a sense th at they produce health benefits at acceptable societal costs. Therefore, the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sports has commissioned RIVM research to identify cost-effective preven tive interventions that are not yet introduced systematically within the Netherlands. This report reflects the results of this research project. 1.2 RIVM work preceding this report From the fact that this report is subtitled 'Further evidence on the cost-effectiveness of prevention', it can be learned that this is not the first report on this issue. Indeed, two previous reports were published, one in 2003 (D irkmaat et al., ) and one in 2005 (Vijgen et page 24 of 163 RIVM report 270091004 al.). The two previous reports and the current report all focus on cost-effectiveness of preventive interventions (defined as disease prevention, health promotion, health protection and health in all policy / healt hy public policies) but di ffer in their specific focus. Here, these differences will be explained in some detail. The main focus of the 2003 report was to de monstrate the fact that many preventive interventions are cost-saving or very cost-eff ective. The aim of the report was merely to provide with examples of cost-effective interv entions, rather than to demonstrate a sound evidence base for cost-effectiveness of prev ention. With \u20ac 2500 per life year / quality adjusted life year gained, a very strict threshold value for cost-effectiveness was used in this report. Preventive interventions were identified using interviews with prevention experts and literature study. Overall, 18 examples of prev entive interventions were presented. Compared to the later work, relatively few restricti ons were set on the evidence base for cost- effectiveness: interventions were included in the report even when only one study supported the cost-effectiveness of the in tervention. From the 18 examples of cost-effective prevention mentioned in the Dirkmaat report, 14 were not yet introduced systema tically (identified as unrestricted access to the intervention for all members of the group at which the intervention is targeted) in the Netherlands, implying that there was ample room for introduction of cost- saving or very cost-effective preventive interventions. Based on this 2003 study, the Ministry of Hea lth, Welfare and Sports asked the RIVM to continue the search for cost-effective preven tion programmes in collaboration with ZonMw, the Netherlands Organisation for Health Re search and Development. The 2005 report of Vijgen et al. (2005) was base d on a more systematic approa ch to identify cost-effective interventions. Besides, more st rict criteria to demonstrate co st-effectiveness were used, in comparison with the first report. Here, the expl icit aim of the study was to identify preventive interventions that were not yet implemented in a systematic and continuous way in the Netherlands. The Ministry of Health, Welfare a nd Sports explicitly asked to identify cost- effective prevention programmes with a short term effectiveness (within five years). Evidence of cost-effectiveness was considered to be sufficient if at least three studies showed a cost-effectiveness ratio below \u20ac 20,000 per QALY, in the absence of studies showing ratios far above that cut-off point. Apart from the cost -effectiveness, also implementation aspects of these programmes in the Netherlands were inve stigated by expert interviews and briefly discussed. Possible interventions were identif ied through a top-down lit erature search, while economic evaluations for those preventive inte rventions were identified using a bottom-up search strategy. Overall, 20 preventive interven tions were identified. On ly those interventions that were being shown in at least three good qua lity economic evaluation studies to be cost- effective (defined here as a cost per life year gained / per quality adjusted life year gained below \u20ac 20,000) were selected. Finally, ten pr eventive interventions were selected and presented in the report. Besides the two previous research reports, RIVM and ZonMw organi zed two workshops at the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Spor ts in 2004 and 2005. The main aim of these workshops was to inform policy makers of the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sports on the availability of cost-effective preventive interventions, and to demonstrate the importance of prevention in general. In these workshops, furt her examples of cost-effective interventions were presented by RIVM and ZonMw. For th e 2004 workshop, no restrictions on the amount and quality of studies suppor ting the cost-effectiveness we re used. For the 2005 workshop, similar criteria to those used fo r the report of Vijgen et al. (2 005) were used. A total number RIVM report 270091004 page 25 of 163 of seven cost-effective preventive interventi ons were presented in the two workshops. The combined results of our previous work are presented in Table 1.1. Table 1.1: Cost-effective a b preventive interventions that have not yet been implemented nationally / systematically / con tinuously in the Netherlands, 2005 Type of prevention Name of intervention Disease prevention Vaccination Vaccination against varicella zoster virus Pneumococcal vaccination of elderly persons Influenza vaccination of healthy working adults Hepatitis A of selected groups of healthy adult workers Screening Chlamydia screening Colon cancer screening Screening for abdominal aorta aneurysm Screening for retinopathy in type 2 diabetes patients Screening for human papiloma virus combined with cervical cytology Other disease prevention Prevention of chronic diseases through obesitas treatment / medication Prevention of recurrent myocard infarct through heart revalidation Prevention of recurrent depression through treatment Prevention of sudden cardiac death through automated external defibrillators Prevention of hip fractures through external hipprotectors Health protection Fluoridation of drinking water Mandatory folic acid fortification of staple foods Prevention of head injuries through bicycle helmets in children Health promotion Smoking cessation programmes via general practioners Lifestyle programmes for type 2 diabetes patients Promotion of breast feeding Prevention of chronic back pain through back-schools Reduction of fat consumption to reduce heart diseases and vascular diseases Prevention of accidental falls in elderly persons a using a threshold value of \u20ac 20,000 per life year gained / quality adjusted life year gained b note that the evidence base supporting the cost-effect iveness is not comparable for all interventions page 26 of 163 RIVM report 270091004 From Table 1.1 it can be seen that in three c onsecutive reports, a tota l number of 23 different interventions were identified as cost-eff ective, without having been implemented systematically and/or nationally in the Netherlands. Please note that the interventions as presented in Vijgen et al. (2005) were selected using much more restricted criteria than the 18 interventions that were presented in Dirk maat et al. (2003). The majority of these 23 interventions are disease prev ention interventions. No single intervention from the healthy public policies domain was identified. 1.3 Aim of the research presented in this report The present report is bu ilt on our previous work and exte nded with two cost-effectiveness estimates from own modelling work . The aim of the research is: to identify further preventive interventions with evidence on cost-effectiveness from at least three good quality economic evaluations; to make an update on the interventions that were described in the Dirkmaat report (2003), using the more strict criteria on evid ence (based on three or more rather than one economic evaluation); to pay more attention to implementation i ssues in comparison to the two previous reports. Promising interventions should not only be relatively cost-effective but there also should not be major barriers for impl ementation in the Netherlands; and finally to model the cost-effectiveness of nation-wide implementation in the Netherlands of two interventions with a good cost-effectiveness profile that also appear to be without major implementation problems. 1.4 Outline of this report This report consists of two major parts, part A and part B. The two parts can be read independently. Part A describes the results of the research to identify cost-effective preventive interventions, part B presents the results of the m odelling work. In chapter 2, the methodology for part A is explained. Here, all terminology that is used throughout this report is explained, including methods for economic evaluation research. In chapter 3, five new preventive interventions are presented. For each intervention the health problem, the nature of the intervention, the evidence for its cost-effect iveness, the transferab ility of foreign study results to the Dutch situation and impl ementation issues surrounding the future implementation in the Netherlands are described. Chapter 4 presents an update of preventive interventions that were first presented in the 2003 Dirkmaat report. Here, the current, more restricted, inclusion criteria are used to find out whether th ere is more evidence supporting the cost-effectiveness of interventions that were first presented in the Dirkmaat report. Also, these interventions are reported using the same fo rmat as used for the five new interventions that were presented in chapter 3. In chapter 5, the main findings from part A of this report are summarized and discussed. Part B of the report is concerned with the modelling of costs and effects of widespread introduction of two preventive interventions in the Netherlands. The interventions are the prevention of recurrent depression episodes and medication to reduce weight in obese persons. Per intervention, chapter 6 describes wh ich methods are used to model the costs and effects of widespread implementation. Furtherm ore, results of the models are explained. RIVM report 270091004 page 27 of 163 Finally, the results of the modelling work are summarized and discussed in chapter 7 (recurrent depression) and 8 (obe sity). A final discussion on pa rt B of the report follows in chapter 9. page 28 of 163 RIVM report 270091004 RIVM report 270091004 page 29 of 163 2. Methodology 2.1 Synopsis of economic eval uation methodology and definitions 2.1.1 Prevention Prevention can be classified in four aproaches : disease prevention, hea lth promotion, health protection, and health in a ll policy (Goldsmith et al., 2004; Vijgen et al., 2005). Disease prevention interventions are often one-on-one activities aimed at prevention of a certain disease or detect a disease in an early stage. Disease prevention includes also activities to prevent further deterioration of disease in patients already known to have a disease. Disease prevention activ ities may be targeted at part icular individuals (e.g., persons at high risk) or at all individuals presenting for clinical ca re. Examples of disease prevention are screening, vaccination programmes and providing prophylaxis. Health promotion interventions encourage individual behaviours believed to produce positive health effects and discourage behaviours that produce negative health effects. Health promotion interventions frequently take the fo rm of public information campaigns. While the decision to undertake the health action is ultimately up to the individual, delivery of health promotion programmes is targeted at a gr oup or population. A me dia-based, lifestyle campaign is an example of a health promotion intervention. Health protection interventions reduce h ealth risks by changing the physical or social environment in which people live. The role of individual beneficiaries of health protection interventions is either passive or limited to compliance with laws or regulations. Health protection interventions are de livered at the organizational (e.g., hospital policy), local, provincial, national or intern ational level. Prohibiting smoking in public places and water fluoridation are examples of a health protection intervention. Health in all policy or healthy public policy describes soci al or economic interventions that affect health but do not have health as the main policy objective. The determinants of health literature provides examples of policy interv entions and social programmes that have important ancillary health effects, such as restricting the placement of video gambling terminals, supportive housing, early childhood education, and the provision of income support. 2.1.2 Economic evaluation methods A full economic evaluation compares two or more interventions (programmes) in terms of their benefits and costs. An economic evalua tion consists of one of the following three approaches: cost-effectiveness analysis, cost-uti lity analysis, or cost-benefit analysis. All three methods measure costs in the same way; th e distinguishing feature of each is the way in which benefits are measured. These different wa ys of measuring benefits bring with them strengths and weaknesses. The methods for asse ssing benefits are as follows (Drummond et al., 1997, Goldsmith et al., 2004). page 30 of 163 RIVM report 270091004 Cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) This analysis measures the benefits of an inte rvention in the most appr opriate natural effects or physical units, such as 'years of life gained ' or 'cases prevented'. Hence, study results are expressed in terms of the additional cost of achieving another unit of the benefit (e.g., the extra cost of preventing an additional case of a condition). The intervention with the lowest cost per additional outcome is the most effi cient intervention. Main advantage of cost- effectiveness analysis is that measuring benefits in natural units simplifies the analysis and is often more intuitive for users of the study. Disadvantages are reduced comparability of efficiency assessments across interventions that produce different outcomes (e.g., flu vaccination versus water fluoridation) and th e need to focus on a single outcome of an intervention even when an intervention generates a number of distinct benefits. Cost-utility analysis (CUA) This method measures benefits in a common unit that strives to include both the quantity and quality of effects associated with an interv ention, usually measured by the quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Hence, a QALY is a meas ure which tries to combine a quantitative measure (years gained, et cetera) with a measur e of effects of the in tervention on quality of life. The most efficient intervention is the one that has the lowest cost per additional QALY generated. Measuring outcomes in a common metr ic such as QALYs in cost-utility analysis greatly enhances the comparabil ity of results across different types of interventions, including those that primarily affect qual ity of life as well as those th at have a larger impact on the number of life years gained. Cost-utility analysis is therefore a broader form of analysis than cost-effectiveness analysis, but is a variant of that approach. Compared to CEA, a key disadvantage is the considerable increase in the complexity of outcomes assessment. Some authors (Gold et al., 1996) pref er not to make a distincti on between CEA and CUA, since they are very similar. Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) This method measures all benefits in monetary te rms, so that the results are usually reported in terms of the net benefit of an intervention (ben efits minus costs) or the ratio of benefits to costs. Therefore, potentially this is the broade st form of analysis, where one can ascertain whether the beneficial conseque nces of an intervention progra mme justify the costs. Cost- benefit analysis can incorporate the widest range of effects across the widest range of interventions and programmes ( both inside and outside the he alth sector), but is often controversial because it requires that the value of the benefits, including death and disease, be expressed in monetary terms. Perspectives One of the first steps in an economic evaluation is to define the pers pective from which an economic evaluation is conducted. The perspective refers to the point of view from which costs and effects are included and how they ar e valued. Examples of perspectives are the patient's, societal or hea lth care perspective. Fo r instance, patient travel costs count as a cost from the patient's and societal perspective, wh ile they may not be counted from the health care perspective. In other wo rds, an economic evaluation conducted from the societal perspective or patient perspectiv e will be more cost-effective or cost-saving than when it is viewed from the health care perspective (Van Baal et al., 2005). RIVM report 270091004 page 31 of 163 2.1.3 Generalizability of economic evaluations An issue that can affect gene ralizability is the fact that many economic evaluations are context-specific and that they cannot be used in other populati ons. This does not invalidate the use of economic evaluation evidence as an important component of health care decision making, but necessitates a warning against si mplistic approaches, as for instance, by construction of league tables which purport to provide a ranking of a wide variety of health care programmes according to their efficiency. The appropriate use of economic evaluation evidence requires detailed consid eration of the quality of the evidence along with thoughtful assessment of threats to transferability to one's own setting and even, in some cases, recalibration of study results to fit better in the specific context of application (e.g., recalculate the cost-effectiveness substituting prices relevant to one's own setting for those from the study setting) (Goldsmith et al ., 2004; Tan Torres Edejer et al., 2004). The difficulties of generalizing context-specific CEA studies were institutionalized by the proliferation of multiple nati onal and subnational guidelines for CEA practice, all using slightly different methods. International guideli nes have not to date been developed (Tan Torres Edejer et al., 2004). However, checklists fo r the transferability of foreign study results to another country were de veloped (Welte et al., 2004). 2.2 Methodology of the present study 2.2.1 Use of thresholds for cost-effectiveness The term cost-effectiveness sugge sts that there are clear cut-o ff points. However, in practice there is some debate on the definition of co st-effectiveness. Recently the Council for Public Health and Health Care (RVZ) has argued that medical treatment should be reimbursed if both the disease burden is signifi cant and the cost-effectiveness ratio is acceptable (Raad voor de Volksgezondheid en Zorg, 2006). In their advi ce, a threshold value for cost-effectiveness of \u20ac 80,000 per quality adjusted life year (QALY) was proposed. This th reshold includes all forms of prevention and care, incl uding life-saving treatments su ch as end-stage renal disease treatment, transplantations and other expensiv e treatments, such as cancer therapy. In our research project, we used the arbitrary cut- off point of \u20ac 20,000 per QALY. This was based on the request of the Dutch Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport, but follows a threshold for prevention that is often used in the Netherlands . However, in health care, particularly with life-saving care, a higher cut-off point appe ars to be acceptable. The recent RVZ report proposed for the first time an actual threshold for medical care. In the report, the cut-off point is used as a reference and not as a hard cut- off point, because generally results are described in ranges and not as a single estimate. Als o, recently it became usance to report cost- effectiveness in terms of the probability that the cost-effectiveness ratio remains below a certain threshold value for cost-effectiveness. 2.2.2 Identification of interesting interventions To identify effective and possi bly cost-effective prevention pr ogrammes three different steps were taken: 1. Experts in the field of pr evention were interviewed. This interview was based on a structured questionnaire (Appendix 1). The experts were asked if they knew cost- effective prevention programmes in their sp ecific area of expertise. These could both be published studies and ongoing studie s. Based on the interviews, a to tal of 35 prevention programmes were identified that are potentially cost-effective (see Appendix 2). page 32 of 163 RIVM report 270091004 2. On the basis of a report from the Canadi an Commission investigating cost-effective prevention programmes (Goldsmith et al., 2004 ), 32 interventions were selected that are not yet systematically implemented in the Netherlands (see Appendix 2). 3. From the intervention programmes iden tified by Dirkmaat et al. (2003), ten interventions are included fo r re-examination. Only those interventions that are not yet systematically implemented in the Ne therlands are re-examined (see Appendix 2 for details). The re-examination was done to assess these interventions using the same methodology as used for interventions describe d in the report of Vijgen et al. (2005) and in the current report. 2.2.3 Global screening of literatu re: creating a longlist A total number of 75 prevention programmes were identified by the interviews and both reports, these interventions were globally scr eened on the availability of three or more good quality studies. This global screening of th e literature was performe d in Medline database (WinSpirs) with the basic keyword (Costs-and- cost-analysis) in MESH (Medical Subject Headings) from January 1989-April 2006. A detailed description of keywords used for the literature search can be found in Appendix 4. An additional s earch was performed in NHS Economic Evaluation Database (EED). Furthermore, a literature search was performed in the databases of Embase, SciSearch, Social SciS earch, Psychinfo and HECLINET by a librarian at the RIVM. This search did not identify any new economic eval uations that had not already been found during the first literature search. Studies before 1989 were excluded because it was anticipated that their results would not be accurate enough and thus , difficult to translate to the current situation. Only Dutch and Eng lish language papers we re included, describing studies that are performed in developed countries. 2.2.4 From long list to short list Based on the global screening, many interventions had to be excluded because of a lack of at least three good quality economic evalua tions or because too many different operationalizations of a preventive programme were found (see Appendix 2). The quality of the studies was assessed by extracting the esse ntial elements (e.g. pe rspective, reference scenario, discounting, and sensit ivity analysis) of every study into a database, and judging these elements on established quality crit eria (based on Drummond and Jefferson, 1996). The following preventive programmes had at le ast three economic evaluations of sufficient quality: - Influenza vaccination of healthy working adults - Fluoridation of drinking water - Mandatory folic acid fortif ication of staple foods - Vaccination against varicella zoster virus - Stop smoking interventions - Pneumococcal vaccination of elderly persons - Universal hepatitis B vaccination - Screening for neonatal group beta streptococcal infections - Rotavirus vaccination of newborns - Human papilloma virus vaccination of adolescents - Pertussis vaccination of adolescents Of all these 11 interventions, th e effectiveness and cost-effectiv eness was carefully reviewed. In addition, the intervention its elf was described as well as the public health problem the RIVM report 270091004 page 33 of 163 intervention is aimed at. In order to assess the feasibility of implementation of the interventions in the Netherlands and to assess the possibility of transfer of the published results to the Dutch situation, experts were in terviewed. This is described in more detail below. 2.2.5 Criteria used for cost-effectiveness A classification system of st rong and moderate evidence wa s used. The qualification of strong evidence (**) was used when the eviden ce unequivocally pointed in the direction of cost-effectiveness (see below for criteria used), while the qualification of moderate evidence (*) was used when not all available studies s upport the cost-effectivene ss of the intervention. The following criteria for cost-effectiveness were used - for cost-effectiveness studies or cost-utility studies (those studies reporting cost- effectiveness in terms of cost pe r life year gained / cost per quality adjusted life year gained): The qualification of strong eviden ce (**) was given when three or more studies show cost- effectiveness not exceeding \u20ac 20.000 per life year gained (LYG) or per quality adjusted life year gained (QALY) while th e ranges around the point estimates do not exceed \u20ac 20,000 per QALY in general and/or a cost-effectiveness a cceptability curve shows that the probability that the cost-effectiveness ratio remains be low \u20ac 20.000 is high. Moderate evidence (*) was defined as follows: three or more studies show cost-effectiveness, defined as cost per QALY below \u20ac 20,000, but the range of CEA ratios may exceed the threshold value of \u20ac 20,000 and/or some studies show a point-estimate in the Base Case analysis that exceeds \u20ac 20,000 per QALY and/or a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve shows a considerable probability that the cost-effectiveness th reshold exceeds \u20ac 20,000 per QALY. - for studies reporting in term s of benefit to cost ratio: Especially in the US, many studies report on cost -effectiveness in terms of benefit to cost ratios. These studies, in general, only pay attention to the financ ial effects of an intervention, by comparing the investments to be made with th e financial gains, for instance, in terms of savings on future healthcare costs for disease or in terms of productivity gains. These studies, in general, assume health benefits of the intervention under study. In these studies, a benefit to cost ratio > 1 reflects cost-e ffectiveness. These studies were included if all important costs were taken into account. If all available studies repor ted a benefit to cost ratio > 1, ** stars were awarded (strong evidence for cost-effectiveness). In a situation where benefit to cost ratios were below 1 as well, the cost-effectiv eness evidence was assessed as being moderate - for studies reporting in terms of cost per case averted: Many studies, especially in th e field of infectious diseas es prevention, report cost- effectiveness in terms of costs pe r case averted. It is not easy to translate this figure to cost per life year gained or cost per QALY gained instantly. Often, an averted case at a young age has more health benefits than an averted case at older age. Again, this ty pe of ratio only pays attention to the financial costs and benefits of an intervention, while not including benefits in terms of life years gained. Here, an attempt was made to relate the cost per case averted to the anticipated costs of one case, preferably using data from the Dutch Cost of Illness Study (Slobbe et al., 2006). With this type of reporting on cost-effectiveness, ** stars were used for cost-effectiveness (strong evidence for cost-effec tiveness) if the cost per case averted was constantly below the expected cost figures fo r a disease case, one * (moderate evidence for cost-effectiveness) was given when the cost-figur es also exceeded the expected cost figures for a case. page 34 of 163 RIVM report 270091004 Cost-effectiveness ratios from foreign studies are transferred to the Euro and recalculated to the year 2005. The background tables in Appendices 6 and 7 both show the costs in terms of original currency and the r ecalculation to 2005 Euro. For th e recalculation to 2005 Euro, OECD Health Data was used (OECD, 2005). 2.2.6 Criteria for transferability to Dutch situation Since the literature is mainly based on internat ional studies, it is not possible to directly generalize the results to the Du tch situation. Therefore experts in the field of the prevention programmes under study were asked to discuss th e translational issue. This interview was done with a semi-structured questionnaire (see Appendix 3). At least two field experts for every intervention were interv iewed. The purpose of the inte rviews was also to detect economic evaluations that were not found by the literature search described above. The transferability of the foreign economic evaluations to the Dutch situation was either scored as 'without major problems' (**) if the results could be easily transferred or as 'with major problems' (*) if there are major problems with transferability of fore ign study results to the Dutch situation and more research in the Dutch cont ext is warranted. 2.2.7 Criteria for implementation in the Netherlands The same experts were also asked to discuss the implementation aspects and possibly, ethical aspects of the interventions. The experts were asked whether implementation of the intervention in the Netherlands was practically, financially and ethically feasible. The questions on implementation issues are summ arized in Appendix 3. In gathering this information, we tried to establish a balanced point of view and not just a simple opinion. However, due to time restraints it was not possi ble to interview a larg e number of people and the information described in this report is for a great part the opi nion of a few experts. Implementation was considered to be good (**) if no problems with respect to implementation were expected and moderate (* ) if some or major problems were expected with regard to implementation in the Nether lands. These problems can concern organizational or infrastructural issues, for instance in a situation where no adoles cent vaccination moment was introduced in the Nationa l Immunization Programme before, or ethical issues, for instance resistance within society to manda tory fortification of staple foods. 2.2.8 Summary of scoring system used All interventions selected are assessed on the following three aspects: cost-effectiveness, transferability of foreign st udy results to the Dutch contex t and implementation issues. A two-star system is used for each item, where two stars rewarded reflect the most positive situation. For cost-effectiveness the stars represent: * Moderate evidence: three or more studi es show cost-effectiveness, defined as: The range of possible values (either from sensitivity analyses or uncertainty analyses) often exceeds the threshold value of \u20ac 20,000 per QALY/LYG and/or some studies show a point-estimate in the Base Ca se analysis that exceeds \u20ac 20,000 per QALY/LYG and/or a cost-effectiveness accep tability curve shows a considerable probability that the cost-effectivenes s threshold exceeds \u20ac 20,000 per QALY. Benefit to cost ratios < 1 are reported. Costs per case averted above the ex pected cost per case are reported. RIVM report 270091004 page 35 of 163 ** Strong evidence: three or more studies show cost-effectiveness, defined as: The range of possible values of the cost-effectiveness ratio (either from sensitivity analyses or uncertainty analyses) does not exceed \u20ac 20,000 per QALY/ LYG and/or a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve show s that the probability that the cost- effectiveness ratio remains below \u20ac 20,000 is high. For transferability the stars represent: * Major problems with transferability of fore ign study results to the Dutch situation, more research in the Dutch context is necessary. ** Results of foreign studies can easily be transferred to the Dutch situation. With respect to implementation issues the stars represent: * Some or major problems were expected with re gard to organizational / infrastructural issues and/or ethical concerns. ** It is anticipated that imple mentation of the intervention in the Netherlands is feasible, implying no major problems with regard to orga nizational / infrastructural issues and/or ethical concerns. page 36 of 163 RIVM report 270091004 RIVM report 270091004 page 37 of 163 3. Results: newly identified preventive interventions 3.1 Screening for neonatal group beta streptococcal infections 3.1.1 Description of health problem Group beta streptococcus (GBS) is a normal body commensal in adults. About 20% of all pregnant women are GBS carrier s, and 50% of the carriers tr ansmit the bacteria to their babies during delivery (Trijbels-Smeulders et al., 2002; NVOG, 1998). About 2% of the infected newborns develop GBS disease within the first seve n days of life (early-onset disease, EOD). The estimated incidence of early -onset GBS disease in the Netherlands is 1.9 per 1000 livebirths (i.e. approximately 400 ne wborn infants per year) (Trijbels-Smeulders et al., 2002). GBS disease is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in newborns. The three most common clinical presentations incl ude sepsis, pneumonia and meningitis (Law et al., 2005). In the Netherlands, the estimated mo rtality rate among neonates with EOD is 5% (Trijbels-Smeulders et al., 2002), and circa 30% of the survivors suffer from permanent disability due to hypoxia (e.g. hearing or visual loss or mental retardation) (NVOG, 1998). 3.1.2 Description of intervention and current situation in the Netherlands Prevention of early-onset GBS disease is aimed at the identification of mothers deemed to be at risk of transmitting GBS to their offspr ing. Treatment with in trapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) was shown to be effective in preventing earl y-onset GBS disease (Law et al., 2005). Various strategies to select the su b-group of high-risk women who should receive IAP were proposed. These strategi es include a risk-based stra tegy, a screening-based strategy, a combined screening/risk-based strategy, and the Dutch strategy: With the risk-based strategy (used in the US), IAP is offered to all women with recognized risk factors for ear ly-onset disease (i.e. previ ous infant affected by EOD, GBS bacteruria detected during current pr egnancy, pre-term labor (<37 weeks), pre- labor rupture of membranes >18 hou rs and/or fever in labor (>38 \u00b0C)). It is estimated that this approach results in 25% of the women being offered IAP, and an incidence reduction of 50-69% (RCOG, 2003; Van den Akker-Van Marle et al., 2005). The bacteriological screening- based strategy involves taki ng vaginal and rectal swabs of every woman between 35-37 weeks of gestation. All women carrying GBS (estimated as 20% of all pregnant women) and all women of whom the test results are not yet known (pre-term birth) are offered IAP. This approach is estimated to result in 27% IAP, and 78-86% incidence reducti on (RCOG Guideline, 2003; Van den Akker- Van Marle et al., 2005). The combination strategy in which all women are screened with swabs as described in the bacteriological screening- based strategy while IAP is offered only to GBS carriers with one or more known risk factor(s) (see risk-based strategy), and not to those without risk factors. This strategy is estimated to re sult in 3% IAP, and 51-56% incidence reduction (Shah et al., 2001; Van den Akker-V an Marle at al., 2005). page 38 of 163 RIVM report 270091004 The Dutch strategy was introduced in the Ne therlands in 1998 by the Dutch Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (NVOG) a nd the Dutch Society of Pediatricians (NVK). This strategy is similar to the risk -based strategy, but doe s not include the two risk factors pre-term labor < 37 weeks and pre-labor rupture of membranes >18 hours. When these two risk factors are present, a vaginal and rectal swab is taken to determine GBS colonization. IAP is offered when an intrapartum culture is positive (NVOG guideline 1998). This strategy is esti mated to result in a 20% reduction of incidence of GBS infection of newborns (Van den Akker-Van Marle et al., 2005). The incidence of proven EOD sepsis decreas ed from 0.54 per 1000 livebirths in 1997- 1998, to 0.36 in 1000 in 1999-2001 after the in troduction of this guideline. The incidence of meningitis and the case fatality rate did not decrease (Trijbels-Smeulders, submitted). 3.1.3 Results from economic evaluation studies Based on literature search and interviews with field experts ten studi es were identified of which seven studies were included in this study (Appendix 6, Table 6.1). One of the included studies was conducted in The Ne therlands. Van den Akker-Van Ma rle et al. (2005) calculated the cost-effectiveness of the four above menti oned prevention strategies of GBS disease in the Netherlands. The authors concluded that the risk-based strategy was the most cost- effective prevention strategy, with \u20ac 7600 per QALY gained. The combined screening risk- based strategy has comparable results, w ith \u20ac 9100 per QALY gained. The combination strategy has also the advantage that less pregnant women have to be treated to prevent a GBS case (62 instead of 101 in the risk-based st rategy). The current Dutch guideline and the screening-based strategy were estimated to have a cost-effectiven ess ratio at \u20ac 48,800 per per QALY, respectively. The polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) test could accelerate the time of determining the colonization of GBS in pregnant women. The test takes about 30-45 minutes in stead of two days with the cu rrent method. The combination strategy with PCR would be very cost -effective with \u20ac 2300 per QALY gained. Stan et al. (2001) compared the current strate gy of Geneva University Hospital (Switzerland) to the risk-based strategy and the screeni ng-based strategy. The risk-based strategy will prevent 69 streptococcal sepsis cases per million deliveries and the costs per averted sepsis case would be \u00a3 60,700. Furthermore, the number need ed to treat to prev ent one sepsis would be 1087. The screening-based strategy would prevent 102 cases of sepsis per million deliveries and the costs per averted sepsis case would be \u00a3 473,600. The number needed to treat is 1029 to prevent one sepsis case. The portion women receiving IAP would increase from 6% (current policy), to 13.5% (risk-based strategy) or 16.5% (s creening-based strategy). In Mohle-Boetani et al. (1999) the cost and health benefits of a risk-based strategy in Northern California, US were estimated. If th e adherence to the guidelines was 100%, 17% of the mothers would receive IAP at the cost of $ 490,000. $ 1.6 million would be saved by preventing 66 GBS cases (64% reduction). Th e net savings would be $ 1.1 million and 61 life-years would be gained in this strategy. If asymptomatic term infants of mothers who received IAP were observed for 48 hours, instead of 24 hours, there would be an additional cost of $ 9.2 million. This would increase the cost per life-year saved to $ 130,000. Benitz et al. (1999) evaluated fi ve strategies to prevent earl y-onset GBS disease in the US. The screening-based strategy where a culture is taken at 28 weeks would prevent 32.9% of the EOD cases and the cost per case preven ted would be $ 22,215. The risk-based strategy would prevent 53.8% of EOD cases and would cost $ 3067 per case prevented. Screening at 35-37 weeks instead of 28 weeks would prevent 75.1% of the EOD cases and the costs would be $ 11,925 per case prevented. The combinati on strategy would prevent 75.6% of the EOD RIVM report 270091004 page 39 of 163 cases and cost $ 9720 per case prevented. Univer sal IAP would prevent the most GBS cases: 80.2%. It would cost $ 12,049 per case prevented. Garland et al. (1995) evaluate d three strategies for prev enting EOD in large teaching hospitals in Australia. With the screening stra tegy cultures were taken at 28 weeks. 46% of all EOD cases would be prevented and the cost per case prevented would be $ 6663. The benefit cost ratio would be 1.33: 1 In the combination strategy 38% of the cases would be prevented with costs of $ 7416 per case preven ted. The benefit cost ratio would be 1.09:1. In the risk-based strategy 80 cases would be prevented. The cost would be $ 270 per case prevented and a benefit-cost ra tio of 56.42:1. In conclusion, the risk-based strategy would be the most cost-effective strategy. Yancey et al. (1994) evaluated the effects and co st of several screening methods in the US. In the screening strategy, w ith taking a culture at 26-28 weeks, the costs would be $ 11,900 per case averted. In the combination strategy cost would be $22.900 per case averted. Other screening methods were also ev aluated but the used tests were found to be unreliable (rapid test instead of a culture for detection of GBS). Mohle-Boetani et al. (1993) compared the outco mes and costs of several prevention strategies versus no intervention from a societal perspect ive in the US. The sc reening strategy would prevent 3300 cases (47% of neonatal disease) and could save $ 16 million in direct medical costs. Cost per case prevented would be $ 28,800 with a benefit cost ratio 1.2:1. The risk- based strategy would prevent 3200 cases and th e net savings would be approximately $ 66 million. Cost per case prevented would be $12.900 with a benefit cost ratio of 2.6:1. 3.1.4 Transferability of foreign study results to Dutch context The validity of the included fore ign studies for the Dutch situation is limited. First of all, in most developed countries most wo men give birth in the hospital. Therefore, in contrast to the Netherlands, no additional costs for hospitalizati on for prevention have to be accounted for. Furthermore, the point in time when a culture sh ould be taken differs between studies. In the older studies (Garland et al., 1995; Yancey et al., 1994; Benitz et al., 1999; Mohle-Boetani et al., 1993) screening occurs at 26 to 28 weeks' gestation instead of 35-37 weeks' gestation, as assumed in the more recent studies. If prenat al screening takes place relatively early in pregnancy, GBS colonization late r in pregnancy can be missed. In Benitz et al. (1999) screening took place at 28 weeks or at 35-37 we eks and showed that screening at 28 weeks prevents 33% of the EOD cases and screeni ng at 35-37 weeks prevents 75.1% of all EOD cases. The current (international) standard is to screen at 35-37 weeks of gestation. Another factor that hampers the ability to generalize the results of foreign studies to the Dutch situation is the assumption on the magnitude of the relative risk. A recent study in the Netherlands concluded that the case fatality rate of early-onset GBS disease in the Netherlands is approximately 5% (Trijbels-Smeulders et al., 2002) but other studies sometimes used a higher mortality rate of 20% . Finally, the strategies described in the publications differ from each other even though th ey are named the same. For instance, in the screening-based strategy describe d in Van den Akker-Van Marle et al. (2005) IAP is given to all cases of (unscreened) pre-term labor. In St an et al. (2001) IAP is given according to the risk-based strategy if no culture re sults are available. This implies that less IAP is given in the strategy of Stan et al. (2001) compared to the strategy in Van den Akker-Van Marle et al. (2005). In conclusion, there are many differen ces between foreign studies and the Dutch situation. This limits the transferability of those results to the Netherlands. However, there is a good-quality Dutch study available that estim ates the cost-effectiveness ratios of the different strategies to prevent GBS disease within the Dutch context. page 40 of 163 RIVM report 270091004 3.1.5 Feasibility of implementation in the Netherlands It seems that the current guideline for the prev ention of early-onset GBS disease is not (cost) effective at this moment (Van den Akker-Van Ma rle et al., 2005; Trijbels -Smeulders et al., ). Other strategies that are ntly available are the screenin g-based strategy, the risk-based strategy and the combination stra tegy. The risk-based strategy di ffers from the current Dutch guideline in offering prophylaxis without screening when specific risk factors are present (i.e. pre-term labor or pre-labor rupture of membra nes >18 hours). Both strategies have, however, the disadvantage that in 40-50% of all cases of EOD no maternal risk factor is present. The combination strategy has this disadvantage as well. In this strategy, only women who are carrier of GBS and have one or more risk fact ors are given prophylaxis. An advantage of this strategy is that less pregnant women receive an tibiotics. Furthermore, obstetricians will be more alert to react on risk factors when a woman is carrier of GBS. A consequence of implementation of the combination strategy may be that after prenatal diagnosis women will demand the antibiotics when test results show that she is carrier of GBS. If this happens, it may possibly lead to a bacteriological screeni ng approach. With the b acteriological screening approach, theoretically all GB S carriers receive prophylaxis during labor which will prevent vertical transmission and thereby EOD with th e newborn. This strategy would, however, have major consequences for the unique obstetric sy stem in the Netherlands. Approximately 30% of the pregnant women deliver at home (in 2000) . Prophylaxis can only be offered in hospital setting, so all carriers of GBS would have to deliver in th e hospital (30,000 women). Apart from the increase in costs induced by the increas e in hospital births, th is may lead to more medicalization of the pregnancy. Finally, the incr ease in prescription of antibiotics will lead to higher resistance of bacteria against antibiotics in long te rm and increasing incidence of neonatal infections by other bacter ia, such as E. coli bacteria. The combination strategy with PCR will be the most cost-effective prevention strategy in the Netherlands (Van den Akker-Van Marle et al., 2005). Accordingly, most health professionals are in favour of the combination strategy as best prevention strategy against GBS disease (based on a poll during a recent symposium entitled 'Prevention of neonatal group B streptococcal disease: Which strategy in th e Netherlands?'). This could, however, change with future developments. Vaginal disinfection with chlorhexidine could be a simple, cheap and safe alternative for the pr evention of early-onset GBS dis ease (Adriaanse et al., 1995). 3.1.6 Summary About 2 in 1,000 newborns develop early-onset group Beta streptococcal disease. Prevention of this disease starts with identifying pregna nt women at risk of tr ansmitting GBS to their offspring. Four different strategies for this selection were proposed: risk-based strategy, screening-based strategy, combination strate gy, and the Dutch strategy. The current Dutch strategy in the prevention of GBS disease seem s to be not cost-effective. The combination strategy seems the most cost-e ffective (< \u20ac 10,000/QALY) and f easible method to implement as prevention strategy for GBS in the Netherlands. Cost-effectiveness: ** Transferability:* Implementation: ** RIVM report 270091004 page 41 of 163 3.2 Universal hepatitis B vaccination 3.2.1 Description of the health problem Hepatitis B is a contagious viral infection caused by hepa titis B virus (HBV). HBV is transmitted via blood, body fluids or at birth. The course of an acute infection varies, from temporary to fatal, from asymptomatic to symp toms as tiredness, fever, joint complaints and jaundice. Acute infection can lead to a persiste nt chronic infection wi th clinical symptoms (caused by liver damage), or, more frequently, to a sub-clinical form of the disease (Van de Laar et al., 2005). There is a st rong relation between age and the c ourse of an acute infection: 1-10% of infected young children (<6) and 30- 40% of older children and adults have symptoms (Van de Laar et al., 2005). Young ch ildren are at greatest risk of a chronic infection; over 90% of those ch ildren infected at birth deve lop a chronic infection. Chronic carriers stay infectious to ot hers and have an increased ch ance of developing long term sequelae, such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (V an de Laar et al., 2005). Worldwide, about 350 to 400 million people are chronically infected with HBV (Kowdley, 2004) and every year more than a million peopl e die of hepatitis B infection. However, the regional prevalence of HBV varies tremendously. In Southeast and Far East Asia countries over 10% of the population is infected, while in Western Europe and North America this is less than 2% (Kowdley, 2004). The prevalence of chronic hepatitis B in the Ne therlands is generally low (about 0.4%), but is higher in risk groups such as drug users, men having sex with men and prostitutes. Also, the prevalence is alleviated in certain immigrant gr oups from countries with intermediate or high prevalence, e.g. mediterranean countries (B oot et al., 2005). In 2003, hepatitis B was 1,877 times reported (319 acute and 1,445 chronic infecti ons) and the incidence of acute hepatitis B was 2.0 per 100,000 inhabitants; 3.1 for men and 0.9 for women (Van de Laar and Op de Coul, 2004; Koedijk et al., 2005). 3.2.2 Description of the intervention and the current situation in the Netherlands Prevention of hepatitis B is possible by vaccinati ng those groups of people not yet exposed to the virus1. Since 1986, safe and effective vaccines ar e available. The vaccine used nowadays in the western world is a recombinant sub-un it vaccine of the hepatitis B (pre)-Surface protein (HBsAg). Adverse events of hepati tis B vaccination are usually mild, of short duration and have the same frequency as in pl acebo recipients (Boot et al., 2005). Standard hepatitis B vaccination consists of three vaccinat ions with an interval of respectively one and at least five months between the consecutive vaccination doses. In 90-95% of vaccinated cases, this leads to an ade quate and lasting (> 15 years, possibly lifelong) protection. There are two different ways of vaccination: universal (a whole cohort receives vaccination regardless of individual risks) and selective (only high risk groups). In 1992, the WHO recommended that universal vaccination against HBV (of infants or adolescents) should be integrated into all national immunization programmes. Most European countries have done so, but the Netherlands and some other count ries with a very low (<1%) HBV carrier prevalence (United Kingdom, Ireland and the Sca ndinavian countries) deci ded not to start an 1 See De Melker HE, Gerritsen AAM, Hahn\u00e9 SJM (Eds.) for further discussion on this subject. page 42 of 163 RIVM report 270091004 universal vaccination programme. It was estim ated that in the Netherlands universal immunization of infants could only prevent 5- 10% of new carriers of HBV, because most newly infected persons came from ab road (Kretzschmar et al., 2002). The current Dutch hepatitis B prevention policy consists of four (voluntary and for free) selective programmes: Screening of all pregnant women and vacci nation of children of infected mothers (since 1989). Vaccination of persons who are at increased risk to be infected or to infect others with hepatitis B through work-related situations (e .g. surgeons, nurses, dentists) or through their living circumstances (e.g. mentally disa bled people living in institutions) (since 2000). Vaccination of all newborn children with one or two parents from a medium or high HBV prevalence region. This is integr ated into the National Immunization Programme (since 2003). Vaccination of four high risk groups, name ly men having sex with men, heterosexual persons who change sex-partners freque ntly, hard drug users and commercial sex- workers. This programme started in 2002 as a catch-up campaign for a four-year period, intended to reach as many members of target groups as possible. Recently, it was decided that this programme will be continued for a longer period. In spite of the four selective programmes, at this moment the vast majority of the Dutch population is not protected against hepatitis B. As part of its permanent advisory role on the contents and organisation of the National Immu nization Programme, th e Health Council of the Netherlands is expected to review the current Dutch hepatitis B prevention policies in the near future. 3.2.3 Results cost-effectiveness studies The description of the cost-effectiveness of uni versal hepatitis B vaccination is based on seven studies (Appendix 6, Table 6.2). Six of th em are European studies, one is from the Netherlands. All studies are based on simulati on models, but the assumptions, time span and methodology used in the studies differ, and th erefore, results differ as well. Outcome measures used were life years gained (LYG) or cases prevented. The studies compared universal vaccinati on (infants, schoolchild ren, adolescents or combinations of these) with prenatal screen ing (De Wit et al., 2000; Wiebe et al., 1997) vaccination of risk-groups (Zurn et al., 2000; Ga ruz et al., 1997; Mangtani et al., 1995) or no vaccination at all (Fenn et al., 1996; Antonanzas et al., 1995). All studies, except the Dutch st udy, showed that universal imm unization is a cost-effective strategy in comparison with pr enatal screening, vaccination of high risk groups or no vaccination at all. However there were differences in the universal strategy that was primarily recommended from a cost-effectiveness perspective. In the studies of Wiebe et al. (1997) and Fenn et al. (1996) immunization of infants is the most cost-effective strategy. The results were 15,900 Canadian Dollars per LYG respectivily 5,234 (undiscounted) or 227,130 (discounted) UK Pounds per LYG. Four studies found that immunization of adolescents is the most cost-effective strategy. Both the results of Garuz et al. (1997) a nd Antonanzas et al. (1995) were presented per cases prevented a nd were 603 (undiscounted) or 850 (discounted) US Dollars, respectivily 49,000 (undiscounted) or 82,000 (discounted) Spanish Pesetas. In the study of Zurn et al. (2000) universal vacci nation of adolescents costs 53,970 Swiss Francs RIVM report 270091004 page 43 of 163 per LYG. This is 2,824 (undiscounted) or 51,81 7 (discounted) UK dollars per LYG in the study of Mangtani et al. (1995). The Dutch study modelled the cost-effectiveness of adding universal vaccination of infants to the prenatal screening programme. Due to the relative high percentage of HBV infections imported by immigrants, universal vaccination of infants had almost no effect on the prevalence and infection pressure on suscep tible persons and only a small impact on prevention of long-term complications of hepatit is B. So in this study, universal vaccination was not a cost-eff ective strategy. All studies included some form of sensitivity anal ysis to assess the effects of key parameters on the estimated outcomes. In ge neral, sensitivity analyses in dicated that vaccination costs, the effectiveness of vaccinati on, prevalence and the discount ra te had the largest impact on the cost-effectiveness. In the Dutch study uni versal immunization of infants became more cost-effective with lower vaccine costs and lower di scount rate of health benefits in the future (De Wit et al., 2000). At presen t, the Dutch cost-effectivene ss analysis is being updated. Several major changes in assumptions are now made compared to the study that was published in 2000, including (much) lower cost s of vaccination, lowe r discount rates for effects of vaccination, and the inclusion of a third route of transmission, namely horizontal transmission at children's age. Preliminary results of the updated analyses show that universal vaccination of both in fants and adolescents have co st-effectiveness ratio's that remain below the threshold of \u20ac 20,000 per QALY (De Wit et al., in preparation). Beutels (2001) reviewed recent (1994-2000) econo mic studies of hepatitis B vaccination. He concludes that economic evaluations of vaccina tion in very low-endemic areas have yielded contradictory results and therefore evidence is inconclusive. Beutels makes clear that the different results are partly determined by diffe rences in modelling techniques and differences in assumptions made in the different studies. Fo r example, using a static model to estimate the effectiveness of vaccinati on at population level underestimat es the cost-effectiveness of vaccination in comparison to a situation wh ere cost-effectiveness is modelled using a dynamic model. According to Beutels (2001) va ccination of adolescents seems most cost- effective for low-endemic countries, because the period between vacc ination and start of sexual activity (the major route of infection in low-endemic countries) is relatively short. 3.2.4 Transferability foreign study results to the Dutch situation Translation of the foreign studies to the Dutch situation has se veral limitations. First and most important, the countries of the study differ in endemicity. The level of prevalence of hepatitis B in a country is a key-parameter in dete rmining the cost-effectiveness of universal immunization, because vaccination is by defin ition more cost-effective in high-prevalence regions. The prevalence in the Netherlands is very low, less than 1%. On ly in the two studies of the United Kingdom, the prev alence is comparable to the Dutch situation. In the other countries, in particular Spain, the prevalence is higher so universal immunization has more effect and is more cost-effective than in the Netherlands. Besides the prevalence, the countries studied differ in other aspects (e.g. transmission route and va ccination rate) from the Dutch situation. In the Netherlands now adays most HBV is transmitted by male homosexual contact, while in some other countr ies intravenous drug use is still an important transmission route. In addition, since the st udies were published, vaccine prices dropped considerably. Also, immigration patterns, and th erefore the proportion of imported infections, changed. These differences between countries have major impact on the estimated cost- effectiveness of vaccination strategies. The ongoing Dutch evaluation study of hepatitis B vaccination strategies ta kes these changes into account (D e Wit et al., in preparation). page 44 of 163 RIVM report 270091004 3.2.5 Feasibility of implementation in the Netherlands At present, the Health Council of the Nether lands discusses the necessity of changing the current risk-based strategy to prevent hepati tis B to a strategy th at includes universal vaccination, either of infants or of adoles cents. Vaccination of newborns from infected mothers and infants with one or two parents from a medium or high HBV prevalence region is already integrated in the National Immunization Programme (NIP). Until April 2006, this used to be done with three se parate injections of hepatitis B vaccine. However, since April 2006, universal infant pneumococcal vaccination was introduced in the National Immunization Programme. To avoi d giving three different injec tions to a child at any one moment, a combination vaccine containing DTP-IPV-HepB-Hib is being used for those children with one or two parents from e ndemic regions. This commercial combination vaccine is relatively expensive in comparison with the DTP-IPV-Hib vaccine that was used before. The undesirability of three different vaccinations at one moment and the relatively high price of the commercial combination va ccine including hepatitis B vaccine might hamper the introduction of hepatitis B vaccina tion for all infants in the short term. As the Dutch National Immunization Programme traditionally was targeted at infants and young school children, universal vaccination of a dolescents would require the introduction of an entirely different age group within the NIP. Many issues surround such a major change in the NIP. At this moment, it is unclear how a succesfull vaccination programme for adolescents can be achieved and preserved. Should it be organized through schools or through municipal health services ? Who needs to give informed consent, only parents or the adolescent as well? Will vaccination against a (mainly) sexually transmitted disease be accepted widely? Will the acceptance of and comp liance with vaccination be sufficient to decrease transmission of the virus at population level? These and other issues need to be resolved before a major change in the NIP can be implemented. Because other vaccines, such as pertussis vaccine (see section 3.4) and human papilloma virus vaccine (see section 3.5), also qualify for vaccination of adolescents, it is expected th at the Health Council committee will reflect upon the possibility of implemen tation of adolescent vaccination in the Netherlands. 3.2.6 Summary Hepatitis B is a contagious vira l infection transmitted via blood, body fluids or at birth. In the Netherlands the prevalence of hepatitis B is generally low, but higher among some groups (men having sex with men, prostitutes, drugus ers) and some immigrant groups. Because of the very low endemicity, the Dutch govern ment decided not to implement universal vaccination, but to implement risk-based preven tion policies, includi ng vaccination of risk- groups. Economic evaluations in very low-ende mic areas have yielded contradictory results on the cost-effectiveness of such policies, therefore evidence is inconclusive. For low- endemic countries, vaccination of adolescents seems more cost-effective than vaccination of infants. Because the Netherlands differs from th e countries studied in for example prevalence, transmission route and vaccination rate, translati on from the international results to the Dutch situation is difficult. However, preliminary results of an ongoing study on cost-effectiveness of different vaccination strategi es for the Netherlands show that both infant vaccination and adolescent vaccination are cost-effective. Impl ementation of universal vaccination in the Netherlands is not without problem s. The undesirability of three different vaccinations at one moment and the relativily high price of th e commercial combination (DTP-IPV-HepB-Hib) vaccine might hamper the introduction of hepa titis B vaccination for all infants. Universal vaccination of adolescents would require the in troduction of an entirely different age group RIVM report 270091004 page 45 of 163 within the NIP. Such a major change in the NI P is surrounded with many issues that need to be resolved Cost-effectiveness * Tranferability * Implementation * 3.3 Rotavirus vaccination of newborns 3.3.1 Description of health problem Rotaviruses are the most common cause of se vere gastroenteritis in infants and young children. It causes fever, diarrhea, and vo miting. Because of the risk of dehydration, a rotavirus infection can be fatal (especially in developing countries). The transmission route is mainly faecal-oral. Other routes are via aerosols and other bo dy fluids. Transmission can also occur via contaminated water or food. The incubation period is a pproximately two days. Symptoms usually accompany primary infectio n, which is followed by protection against subsequent rotavirus infections. For this re ason, the peak attack rates for symptomatic rotavirus disease occur in children between 6 and 12 months of age. In the Netherlands rotavirus infection in children is seasonal, with highe st incidence in winter months. The annual incidence of rotavirus infections is approximately 190,000, of which 58,000 in children younger than five year s of age (Kemmeren et al., 2006). About 3,400 children younger than five years are hospitalized for rotavirus each year (this includes infections that are acquired in hospitals ). Infections are estimated to be fatal in approximately two to three of all hospitalized rotavirus cases younger than five years (Mangen et al., submitted). 3.3.2 Description of intervention and current situation in the Netherlands Current prevention measures in the Netherla nds to counteract tran smission of rotavirus consist of hygiene guidelines at day-care cen ters, primary schools, hospitals and nursing homes. Once infected with rotavirus, conseque nces of diarrhea and vomiting are treated, not the virus itself. Treatment is targeted towa rds the prevention of dehydration. For prevention of rotavirus infection, two oral live-attenuate d rotavirus vaccines are available: RotaRix\u00ae and RotaTeq\u00ae. RotaRix\u00ae was licensed in the Netherlands in March 20061. The licensure for RotaTeq\u00ae was approved by the European Union in June 2006. Both vaccines target the most found rotavirus serotypes G1-G4. The RotaRix\u00ae vaccination was estimated to reduce rotavirus gastroenteritis induced hospitalization for at least one night by 85% (Ruiz-Palacios et al., 2006). The vaccine efficacy of RotaTeq\u00ae against office or clinical visits for rotavirus gastroenteritis was estimated to be 86% (Vesik ari et al., 2006). For both vaccines, no increase in serious bowel blockages (intussusception) was noted among recipients of the vaccine versus placebo (Ruiz-Palacios et al., 2006; Ve sikari et al., 2006). A former vaccine, Rotashield\u00ae, was withdrawn from the US market with in one year of its introduction because of its association with intussusception. Both rotavirus vaccines are intended to be gi ven to infants at the same time as their immunizations for diphtheria-pertussis and te tanus, which are currently included in the 1 See De Melker HE, Gerritsen AAM, Hahn\u00e9 SJM (Eds.) for further discussion on this subject. page 46 of 163 RIVM report 270091004 National Immunization Programme. RotaRix\u00ae and RotaTeq\u00ae are administered as an oral liquid in buffer as two doses (Rotarix\u00ae) or three doses (RotaTeq\u00ae) to babies, with the first dose given at 6-14 weeks of age . 3.3.3 Results from economic evaluations The description of the cost-eff ectiveness of rotavirus vaccina tion is based on five studies (Appendix 6, Table 6.3). These studies are based on data for the Rotashield\u00ae vaccine (withdrawn from the market, as described a bove) and not on data for the new vaccines. However, given the similarities in efficacy, the re sults are expected to be generally applicable to the new vaccines (Walker and Rheingans, 2005 ). The first economic evaluations of the new rotavirus vaccinations are appearing at presen t, but until now these st udies are targeted at developing countries. All studies compared vaccinati on against rotavirus with no in tervention. Two of the studies were performed using data from randomize d, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. Other studies were model-based. The studies either conclude that vaccination is cost-neutral (Griffiths et al., 1995; Takala et al., 1998; Tucker et al., 1998) or that the vaccine is even cost-saving (Smith et al., 1995; Carlin et al., 1999). All studies used a societal perspective; some studies included the heal th-care perspective as well (Car lin et al., 1999; Smith et al., 1995; Tucker et al., 1998). All studies estim ated the break-even price, computed by appointing what cost of the vacc ine infers economic neutrality (costs to deliver the vaccine are equal to the costs the vaccine saves in tr eatment costs averted and productivity losses averted). As the future vaccine price was unknown in all studies, the studies calculated net costs either by using a range of vaccine prices or by estimating the threshold price at which vaccination would be cost-neutral. Besides the br eak-even price, some studies also estimated the cost per event avoided (Smith et al., 1995; Tucker et al., 1998; Carlin et al., 1999). Studies differ from each other with respect to assumed incidence rates of rotavirus, vaccine efficacy, and costs of the vaccine. Cumulative incide nce rates of rotavirus diarrhea in the first five years of life ranged from 55% to 85%. Diffe rent estimates of rotavirus vaccine efficacy ranging from 50% to 95% were used in the studies. The price per dose of rotavirus vaccine ranged from US$ 0.45 to US$ 30. All of the st udies included some form of sensitivity analysis to assess the effects of key parameters on the estimated outcomes. Most studies included efficacy and vaccine price in their es timates. From these sensitivity analyses, it appeared that especially the costs of the v accine and loss of productivity (work hours lost by parents) affected the break-even price of the rotavirus vaccine. Discounting was not undertaken in studies of Takala et al. (1998), Carlin et al. (19 99) and, Griffiths et al. (1995). The authors justified this by stating that the ma jor part of rotavirus hospitalizations occurred before the age of two years. As this was a relatively short time fr ame, no discounting was applied. 3.3.4 Transferability of foreign study results to Dutch context There are several threats to the transferability of foreign study results on the cost- effectiveness of the rotavirus va ccine within the Dutc h situation. Firstly, it is likely that the amount of workdays lost in The Netherlands will be substantially lower than assumed in foreign studies (Mangen et al., submitted). In a societal perspective, more workdays lost justify higher vaccine costs. Because work ab sence is relatively low in the Netherlands, the vaccine costs should be low in order to reach outcomes that are cost-neutral. However, the first information on vaccine prices does not poi nt in that direction. Parashar et al. (2006) reported a cost price of US$ 69 per dose for RotaTeq\u00ae, which is US$ 207 for three doses. RIVM report 270091004 page 47 of 163 This price exceeds the prices that are presum ed in the studies on cost-effectiveness of rotavirus vaccination. Foreign studies show th at vaccine price is a major factor that determines whether a rotavirus vaccination progr amme is cost-effective or not. A decrease in the vaccine costs is needed before introducti on of rotavirus vaccines in the Dutch National Immunization Programme (NIP) would become cost -effective. This is also concluded in a forthcoming study on the cost-effectiveness of introduction of rotavirus vaccine in the NIP (Mangen et al., submitted). Secondly, the inciden ce of rotavirus in the Netherlands is lower than in countries in which the regarded studi es took place. The incidence of rotavirus is important for the estimated effectiveness and asso ciated cost-savings of averted infections of vaccination. Therefore it can be expected that vaccination is less cost-effective in the Netherlands. Thirdly, in the consideration of including rotavirus vaccination in the National Immunization Programme it would be important to have better insight into circulating rotavirus strains in the Netherlands. The curre nt vaccines are focused on G1-G4 serotypes. These are also the most commonly found strains in the Netherlands (Van der Heide et al., 2005), but in the past decades other serotypes have emerged, especially the G9 rotaviruses. In 2006, also a new rotavirus, G12, was identified in the Netherlands. 3.3.5 Feasibility of implementation in the Netherlands Because oral rotavirus vaccine can be given at the same time as simultaneously administered routine infant vaccines, mass vaccination coul d be relatively easy to implement in the Netherlands. As the RotaRix\u00ae vaccine should be administered at two and four months, the vaccination can be combined with vacci nation against diphtheria-tetanus-polio- Haemophilus influenzae type b and pneumococcal disease. RotaTeq\u00ae requires an additional session in the National Immunization Programme. No observation is made that either of the two vaccines would affect the immune response of simultane ously administered routing infant vaccines (Parashar and Glass, 2006). However, implemen tation of rotavirus im munization at current sessions implies that the current maximum of two vaccines per session would have to be exceeded. A substantial reduction in morbidity from childhood gastroenteritis would be expected, although the impact on mortality in the Netherlands is likely to be limited. As parental perceptions of the severity of disease have always been strongly associated with high coverage of vaccination, there was concern that the vaccine would not be acceptable to parents in the Netherlands (Van de Bove nkamp-Meijer and R\u00fcmke, 2005). This could possibly have an impact on uptake of vacci nation against other diseases as well. 3.3.6 Summary Rotaviruses are the most common cause of seve re watery diarrheal di sease in infants and young children. Several economic evaluations conc lude that rotavirus immunization would be cost-neutral or even cost -saving. Although these results are based on data on the former vaccine Rotashield\u00ae, the results are expected to be gene rally applicable to two new vaccines that recently became available (RotaRix\u00ae and RotaTeq\u00ae). However, it can be expected that vaccination is less cost-effectiv e in the Netherlands, because rotavirus incidence is lower, vaccine costs are higher and work absence of pa rents is less than assumed in foreign studies. Mass rotavirus vaccination could be relatively easy implemented in the Netherlands. As rotavirus vaccination is available in an oral variant, implemen tation would not be associated with the necessity to increase the number of injections at one mome nt. However, it remains questionable whether this vaccine is acceptable to parents who perceive a rotavirus infection to be a relatively innocent disease. page 48 of 163 RIVM report 270091004 Cost-effectiveness: * Transferability: * Implementation: * 3.4 Pertussis vaccination of adolescents 3.4.1 Description of the health problem Pertussis or whooping cough is a highly contagious di sease of the respir atory tract and is transmitted by coughing (Mooi et al., 2005; De Bo er et al., 2005). In coughing patients the contagiousness may last for three weeks after the onset of symptoms. Someone without overt symptoms can still be infectious. Symptomatic pertussis starts as a normal cold, sometimes with fever. After one to two weeks typical symptoms develop, like severe coughs, which last for at least two weeks. These severe coughs can be accompanied by cyanosis, apnoea and fever. The most prevalent complications of pertussis are secondary infections, such as inflammation of the middle ear or of the lung (>20%), or affect ed function of the brain (1%). Particularly in young children, th e disease can cause severe complications and babies can die from it (Mooi et al., 2005; De Boer et al., 2005). After the implementation of pertussis vacci nation in 1952 the number of children with pertussis decreased (Mooi et al., 2005). In the la st ten years, the incidence of notified cases (total population) varied between 50. 2/100,000 in 2001 and 16.0/100,000 in 1998 (De Greeff et al., 2003). Of all diseases which are part of the Dutch National Immunization Programme (NIP), pertussis has the highest incidence per person per year (De Melker et al., 2005). Based on a cross-sectional modelling study, the actual incidence of pertussis infections in the Netherlands was estimated at 6.6% in 1995 in the age category 3-79 year, with highest incidence reported in the ages of 20-24 years (De Melker et al., 2006). Infections in older adolescents and adults contribu te to the transmission of pe rtussis to high-risk groups, especially neonates which have not yet been suff iciently vaccinated (De Melker et al., 2005). Although the number of pertussis cases in children aged 1-4 y ears and 5-9 years decreased - most likely due to the introduction of the booster vaccine for four-year-olds - , the number of cases among adolescents and adults increased in 2004 in comparison with 2001 (Mooi et al., 2005). 3.4.2 Description of the intervention and current situation in the Netherlands In 1952 pertussis vaccination was introduced in the Netherlands, first as a single vaccine and later in combination with diphtheria, tetanu s, polio (DTP-IPV) and Haemophilias influenza b (Hib) (De Melker et al., 2005)1. Currently, children are vaccin ated at 2, 3, 4 and 11 months with the acellular DTP-IPV-Hib vaccine. An acellular repeating (= booster) vaccination is given at 4 years of age since the end of 2001 (see Table 3.1). Different vaccination strategies to decrease diseases burden from pertussis were suggested (Forsyth et al., PIDJ 2005; 24: S69-S74), among them: universal adult vaccination, selective immunization of close contacts of young newborns, selective i mmunizations of health care workers, universal immuni zation of adolescents. As mentioned before, the pertussis inciden ce among adolescents ( 10-19 years) is still increasing, leading to school abse nces, parental time lost fr om work, and extra costs for 1 See De Melker HE, Gerritsen AAM, Hahn\u00e9 SJM (Eds.) for further discussion on this subject. RIVM report 270091004 page 49 of 163 medical care and public health surveillance. Pe rtussis booster vaccinatio n of adolescents (and adults) could possibly be useful to prevent morb idity in this age group and limit the spread of disease to susceptible individuals (herd immunity effect), partic ularly to infants who did not yet receive the complete cycle of five vaccine s (Marchant, 2005). Several studies evaluated the role of adolescents and adults in transmission of pertussis to infants (Bisgard et al., 2004; Long et al., 1990; Izurieta et al ., 1996). These studies emphasize the role of adolescents and also adults in disease transmission to infants. Currently, pertussis vaccine is not recommended fo r persons older than 4 years of age in the Netherlands because of past concerns about the safety of whole-cell pe rtussis vaccines. Safer acellular pertussis (aP) vaccines were developed and are evaluated in adolescents and adults and determined to be safe and immunogenic (W ard et al., 2005; Stre bel et al., 2001; Tran Minh et al., 1999; Rothstein et al., 1999). Currently, adolescent vaccination is recommended in the US, Canada, Australia, France, Austria, Germany, Malta and Finland (Eurosurveillance 2004;9:70) ( www.euvac.net ) (Halperin et al., 2005) In the Netherlands the licensed vaccine for adolescents 10 to 18 year s of age is Boostrix\u00ae. The preventive intervention examined in this section is acellula r booster vaccination of adolescents (10-19 years). 3.4.3 Results from economic evaluation studies Five cost-effectiveness studies were found in the literature (Appendix 6, Table 6.4). None of these studies was adapted to the Dutch situati on. From those five st udies, three had QALY or LYG as an outcome measure (Caro et al., 2005a; Lee et al., 2005; Edmunds et al., 2002 ), one study resulted in a clinical outcome measures, namely pertussis cases avoided (Iskedjian et al., 2004). And the fifth study looked at the break -even cost per vaccin ation (Purdy et al., 2004), that is the vaccine-price at which the pr eventive intervention would be cost-neutral to society. The studies by Caro et al. (2005a) and Lee et al. (2005) compared the US pertussis immunization schedule (a combined acellular DT P) with or without an adolescent acellular booster dose, given specific estimates of herd immunity. In the study by Caro et al. (2005a) the cost-effectiveness ratio was $ 22,023 per life year gained (LYG) from the health care perspective and $ 6,253 per LYG from the soci etal perspective assuming a reduction in non- target cases (herd immunity) of 20%. Assuming a herd immunity of 5% resulted in high cost- effectiveness ratios. Herd immunity of 35% resu lted in cost-savings. The authors warned that their results should be viewed with caution gi ven the large gaps in the evidence surrounding the true incidence of typical symptomatic pertus sis. Lee et al. (2005) concluded that one-time vaccination of adolescents might be reasonably cost-effective if the vaccination price is comparable to that in other countries wher e it was being used at that moment (Germany, Canada, Australia, France). With an incr emental vaccine price of $ 15, a single-dose adolescent vaccination strategy costs $ 20,000 per QALY from the societal perspective and $ 23,000 per QALY from the health care perspective. The results were sensitive to several key assumptions: disease incidence, vaccine efficacy , vaccine-associated costs and frequency of vaccine adverse events. These parameters were varied over wide ranges because of their uncertainty. The study might have underest imated the disease incidence due to underreporting. However, at extremely high di sease rates the vaccination appears more favourable in terms of cost-effectiveness. Is kedjian et al. (2004) evaluated a combined vaccination programme (CVP) including a diphth eria, acelular pertussis and tetanus (dTap) vaccine at 12 years of age in comparison with the DT immunization in Canada, Ontario at page 50 of 163 RIVM report 270091004 that moment. From a Ministry of Health pe rspective, the combined programme costs $CAN 188 per pertussis case avoided. The program me was cost-saving from the societal perspective. According to Purdy et al (2004) the break-even cost per adolescent pertussis vaccination was $ 36.92. They were not able to predict the long- term protection from booster vaccination or the optimal window of revaccination, because of the unclear long-term ef ficacy of aP vaccine in adolescents and because herd immunity is difficult to model. Edmunds et al (2002) compared an acellular pertussis booster dose at 15 years of age with no vaccination assuming different percentages of cases prevented in young er infants (20-80%). From the health care perspective the booster was only cost-effective when minimal 60% of the cases in younger infants were prevented (\u00a3 13,019 per LYG). The re sults were sensitive to variations in the degree of herd immunity protection, mortalit y rate, degree of under-r eporting, vaccine cost and the discount rate for both the costs and benefits. The American Committee of Infectious Dis eases (2006) gave an overview of economic studies in a policy statement with reco mmendations for pertussis vaccination among adolescents. Their conclusion is that univer sal, single-dose acellular DTP vaccination during adolescence is a cost-effective strategy consider ing a variety of assump tions like incidence of pertussis, waning (decreasing) immunity, va ccine efficacy, vaccine coverage and infant transmission. Hay et al (2005) re viewed the direct and indirect costs associated with pertussis and its complications and cost-b enefit analyses of pertussis booster vaccination as mentioned before (Purdy et al., 2004; L ee et al., 2004). They concluded that vaccination of adolescents with the acellular DTP booster va ccine can be a cost -beneficial strategy. Caro et al (2005b) reviewed the studies mentioned before (besides Lee et al., 2004) and concluded that the results are inconsistent because of differences in estimates of the true incidence of pertussis and of the potential herd immunity. Further economic analyses are required (Caro et al., 2005b). 3.4.4 Transferability of foreign study results to the Dutch context All the cost-effectiveness studies as found in the literature we re from abroad. However, the uncertainties as mentioned in the foreign studies will probably be uncertain in any future Dutch study as well. The true inci dence of pertussis is not known as current surveillance data will probably be underreported, since only patien ts that consult the general practitioner are registered. The transmission routes through wh ich infants are infect ed are still unclear. Therefore, the RIVM has initiated the BI NKI-Study. In this study, family members of pertussis-infected infants are tested for pert ussis infection. The results of this study are expected to provide more information about the transmission patterns of pertussis. Iskjedan et al. (2001 Pharmaeconomics) suggest that adequate coverage of the target population can be attained by coupling the ace llular pertussis vaccine with the existing Canadian DT booster at adolescence age. That also keeps the administration costs to a minimum. The cost-effectiveness studies only lo oked at adding the booster to the DT. In the Netherlands the last DT booster is given at th e age of nine years. Table 3.1 describes the pertussis immunization schedules of the countri es that already intr oduced the adolescent booster vaccination. Nearly all these countries added an extr a booster to the schedule, but only Australia replaced their former 18 months v accination with the vaccination at the age of 15-17 years. RIVM report 270091004 page 51 of 163 Table 3.1 Pertussis immunizati on schedules in several coun tries (Halperin et al., 2005) Country Previous schedule Revised schedule Pr oduct used Implementation strategy for adolescent vaccination The Netherlands 2,3,4,11 mo 4 yr Not yet Acellular DTP-IPV/Hib DT-IPV Wholecell DTP-IPV/Hib Tdap A government-funded, national programme that is mainly delivered by private physicians (60% uptake) Germany 2,3,4,11-14 mo 2,3,4,11-14 mo 14-16 yr Acellular HBV Tdap in physicians' offices (uptake 20- 30%) Australia 2,4,6,18 mo 4 yr only Acellular DTP Tdap The adolescent dose is provided by the government and is administered in schools United States 2,4,6,18 mo 4-6 yr 2,4,6,18 DTP- IPV 3.4.5 Feasibility of implementation in the Netherlands In order to assess the feasibility of implementa tion of adolescent pertus sis vaccination in the Netherlands, it is important that the aim of v accination is clearly stated. Either it is the intention to protect those infa nts who are too young to be fully immunized themselves, or vaccination is introduced to lower both in cidence in the youngest infants and overall incidence. This is important, because the aim of the vaccination determines to a large extent which prevention strategy appears to be most attr active. If the aim of vaccination is to protect those young infants, maternal immunization and 'cocooning' (the vaccin ation of individuals around the newborn) should be taken into acc ount as well. Then, the ethical aspects of vaccination of persons who do not directly benefit from the vaccination themselves are of importance. Should pertussis vaccination of adolescents be at tractive, it remains to be seen at what age this vaccine could be given. Halperin et al . (2005) described the experiences of Canada, France, Germany and Australia with implemen tation of their pertus sis vaccine booster-dose programme in adolescents. In Table 3.1, these pr ogrammes are described. From the table, it can be seen that some countries used physicians , e.g. the general practit ioner, as vaccination provider while other countries provide the vacc ination in a school se tting. The uptake in physician's settings was relativ ely low (20-60%), whereas no information was available on the uptake in school settings. In the Netherlands , infants are vaccinated in consultation offices by a physician specialized in early childhood. School children (9 years of age) are vaccinated by a school physician or they are invited to go to Municipal Hea lth Centres. This appears to be a satisfying approach in term s of uptake of the Td vaccine and could possibly be an option for adolescent pertussis vaccination as well. One other option is to combine pertussis vaccination with another potential new vaccination in adolescen ce, like HPV vaccination (see section 3.5). A problem is that in the Netherlands, possibly only women will be regarded as a target group for HPV vaccination, so then men w ould be missed for the pertussis vaccination. Humiston et al. (2005) concluded that adolescents have unique health care needs, and that there are some barriers to reach them. Some promising interventions for vaccination of page 52 of 163 RIVM report 270091004 adolescents are outlined in this article. At the health care system leve l, reducing out-of pocket costs for adolescents by offering free vacci nations, expanding acce ss to immunizations (convenient opening hours services or bringi ng services closer to the client), and implementing vaccination programmes in schools we re effective. Halperin et al. (2005) also concluded that school-based pr ogrammes appeared to be most successful in achieving high rates of immunization. In the Netherlands, childr en in the age of 5, 9 and 14 years are invited for a preventive examination by a school physicia n. The latter visit (at the age of 14) could possibly be combined with pertussis booster vacc ination. At present, no vaccination is given at that age. However, the most appropiate age at which vaccination should be given is dependent on the aim (reducing overall morbid ity or reducing infant morbidity) and the expected effectiveness of vaccination at that age. 3.4.6 Summary The main conclusion of this section is that pe rtussis vaccination of adolescents - aiming to prevent pertussis in both infants and adolescent s - possibly could be cost-effective. However, conclusions should be interpreted with caution, b ecause of great uncertain ties in the estimates of the true incidence of pertussis morbidity, transmission routes and the extent of herd immunity. The cost-effectiveness ratios range from cost-saving to $187,081 per life year gained, depending on the level of herd immunity assumed. Converting this to 2005 Euros will result in a range from cost-saving to \u20ac186,000 per LYG. Nearly all the existing cost- effectiveness results appeared to be sensitive fo r the level of herd immunity and the degree of underreporting. From the health care perspective, herd immunity has to be at least 20% according to Caro et al. (2005a) and 60% according to Lee et al. (2005). Additional information about disease incidence, vaccine efficacy, and vaccine adverse events would contribute to a future policy decision a bout implementation of this vaccine. Cost-effectiveness: * Transferability: * Implementation: * 3.5 Human papillomavirus vacc ination of adolescents 3.5.1 Description of health problem Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer among women worldwide, accounting for about 10% of all cancers (Franco and Harper , 2005). In 2003, 214 women died from cervical cancer in the Netherlands (CBS, 2005) a nd each year approximately 700 women are diagnosed with this disease (NKR, 2004). Cervi cal cancer is caused by a persistent human papillomavirus (HPV) infection (Franco a nd Harper, 2005). HPV comprises more than 100 different types of viruses; approximately 40 of these are specific for the ano-genitial region. Human papillomaviruses are the most common sexually transmitted viral agents. The prevalence of HPV infection in the population therefore peak s among persons in their late teens or early twenties during the years following onset of sexual activity (Jacobs et al., 2000). Therefore, 20 to 25% of young women are infected with HPV. Most of the HPV infections are transient, but the persistent in fections, however, might lead to cervical cancer. HPV types 6 and 11 may cause genital warts a nd HPV types 16 and 18 ar e associated with cervical cancer (Sanders and Taira, 2003). The period between the start of the infection and the development of cervical cancer is quite large (>20 years) (Bonnez et al., 2002). RIVM report 270091004 page 53 of 163 3.5.2 Description of intervention and current situation in the Netherlands The intervention in this section concerns vacc ination against human papillomavirus infection in adolescents that are not yet sexually active1. Such vaccination is expected to have a positive influence on the future incidence of cervical cancer (Koutsky et al., 2006). A screening programme will always be necessa ry because a quarter of the cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN- 3, pre-cancerous lesions of the cervix) and cervical cancers cases are caused by other HPV genotypes. At pres ent, it is uncertain whether boys should be vaccinated as well. Including boys in a vaccination programme is expected to limit the spread of disease (herd immunity) and will probably lead to a further decrease in overall incidence of cervical cancer (Taira et al., 2004). At present, all Dutch women between the ages of 30 and 60 years are screened for cervical cancer every 5 years. Consequently, a large re duction in progressed fo rms of cervical cancers was achieved (Van Ballegooijen et al., 1992). A major problem with th e current screening programme is the difficulty in recognizing the pre-stage cervical cancers that will develop into progressed stages, as many pre-stage ce rvical cancers show spontaneous regression (Crum, 2002). Furthermore, th e current screening tests lack sensitivity and are relatively expensive. Often screening will unnecessary fr ighten women because the detected abnormal result would never have progr essed to cancer (Quint et al ., 2006). Furthermore, as the screening programme is a form of secondary pr evention, it has little impact on circulation and transmission of the vi rus in the population. Two vaccines against HPV were developed: Gardasil \u00ae and Cervarix\u00ae. Gardasil\u00ae has recently obtained a European licence (September 2006) . A decision on the licensure of Cervarix\u00ae is expected in the first half year 2007 (Boot et al ., 2006). The effectiveness of these vaccines in the prevention of cervical cance rs is high: 90% effectivene ss against transient HPV16/18 infections and almost 100% protection agai nst persistent infections (minimal 6 months infected with HPV 16/18) (Villa et al ., 2006). Koutsky et al. (2006) showed in their trial 100% efficacy of an HPV vaccine over an 18-month period in preventing persistent HPV 16 infection and HPV 16-specific CIN. Long term effectiveness (>5 years) is still uncertain. 3.5.3 Results from economic evaluation studies The literature search resulted in six cost -effectiveness studies of HPV vaccination (Appendix 6, Table 6.5). Four of the six studies were of good quality and are described in this subsection. All four studies were performed in the United States. The first study compared HPV-16 and 18 vaccination of girls at age 12 (i n three doses) and a boos ter at 22 years with no vaccination intervention. This resulted in a cost-effectiveness ratio of $ 14,583 per QALY. Including vaccination of boys a ppeared not to be cost-eff ective (Taira et al., 2004). The second study compared several combinati on strategies of vacci nation and screening varying the screening intervals and starting ages of screening (Goldie et al., 2004). As this study models several combinations of the sc reening programme and vaccination, this study can be used to receive an impression whic h strategy would be mo st cost-effective. In Table 6.5 (Appendix 6) only the most cost-eff ective strategies are shown. The most cost- effective strategy was then screening (HPV test inclusive) starting at age 35 every 5 years and vaccination (100% efficacy) at 12 years, with a ratio of US$ 12,300/QALY. Other strategies in this study had ratios varying from US$ 17,200/QALY (screening starting at age 30 every 5 1 See De Melker HE, Gerritsen AAM, Hahn\u00e9 SJM (Eds.) for further discussion on this subject. page 54 of 163 RIVM report 270091004 years and vaccination (90% efficacy)) to US$ 3,867,500/QALY (screening (liquid-based) starting at age 18 every year and vaccinati on (90% efficacy)). The third study compared (school-based) HPV vaccination of females aged 12 years and standard care with standard care only (=conventional, biennial, cervical cancer screening starting at age 16 years) (Sanders et al., 2003). This resulted in a co st-effectiveness ratio of $ 22,755 per QALY. HPV vaccination appeared to be more cost-effectiv e if no boosters but lif etime immunization was assumed, if the incidence of HPV infection wa s higher and if the screening frequency was decreased to every five years. The fourth study examined 40 strategies, varying from screening only strategies (c onducted every 1, 2, 3 and 5 years) to strategies combining screening plus vaccination at identical intervals, varying the ages of screening onset (ages 18 years, 22 years, 24 years, 26 years, and 30 years) (Kulasingam and Myers, 2003). The screening only interventi ons with less frequent intervals and later starting ages were cost- effective, with ratios of $ 21,912/LYG at a ma ximum. The combination strategies with vaccination were less cost-effective, with ra nges from $ 44,889 per LYG (for vaccination and screening every 2 years, starting age 24 years co mpared with screening every 3 years) to $ 236,250 per QALY (vaccination and screening every year starting at age 18 compared with the same strategy starting age 22 years. Of the studies mentioned above, only Taira et al. (2004) included herd immunity effects by using a transmission model. Vaccine evaluations that do not include disease transmission can underestimate actual vaccine benefit (Brisson and Edmunds, 2003; Edmunds et al., 1999). So the other results could be underestimated. Dasb ach et al. (2006) re viewed the state of mathematical modelling of HPV disease for ev aluating HPV vaccinati on strategies, including the four above mentioned studies. A consistent finding was that vaccinating females may be cost-effective. The cost-effectiveness of vacci nation further improved if vaccination was used to delay the start of or wide n the interval between consecuti ve cervical cancer screening intervals. The most important determinants that influence co st-effectiveness of vaccination are: the duration of vaccine pr otection, vaccine effectiveness, vaccination cost, the health utilities used to estimate QALYs and whether or not males were vaccinated (Dasbach et al., 2006). In 2006, a preliminary cost-effec tiveness analysis is performe d by the Dutch Institute of Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) and VU University Medical Center as part of an assessment study on the introduction of universal HPV vaccination of pre-adolescent girls (Boot et al., 2006). They used a rather conserva tive approach in their analysis. Although first results with regard to cost-eff ectiveness are promisi ng, the analysis at pr esent cannot be used to underpin major decision making on the future implementation of HPV vaccination in the Netherlands 3.5.4 Transferability of foreign study results to Dutch context The screening programme in the US is entirely different from th at in the Netherlands. In the US, the starting age of screeni ng is earlier (21 years) and th e interval between subsequent invitations is only two years. In the Ne therlands, women are entering the screening programme at the age of 30 years with an 5-year interval, with a participation rate of about 70%. The Dutch screening programme is more cost-effective than the US screening programme (Van den Akker-Van Marle et al., 2 002). A conclusion as stated in most of the cost-effectiveness studies as described above is that HPV vaccination would become more favourable in combination with a simultaneous change of the current screening programme, namely to start at a later age and use wider intervals between consecu tive screenings. In RIVM report 270091004 page 55 of 163 comparison to the US situation, the adaptations to the cervical cance r screening programme are already practised in the Netherlands. Uncer tainties surrounding vaccine effectiveness will be of major influence on the cost-effectivene ss of HPV vaccination in the Netherlands. Taira et al. (2004) examined the influence of broa dening the screening intervals on the cost- effectiveness of a vaccination programme. They concluded that the wider the screening interval is (>every 2 years), the more cost-eff ective the vaccination programme is expected to be. The US does not have a national immuniza tion programme like the Netherlands has. Probably, a lower vaccine price is achievable in the Netherlands than in the US because of high vaccine volumes needed in the cont ext of a national immunization programme. Furthermore, the vaccination coverage rate in the US is in general lower than in the Netherlands. The US cost-effectiveness studies vary the coverage rate between 50 and 100%. In the Netherlands vaccination coverage is traditionally very hi gh (>95%) for childhood vaccination (<9 years). However, at present it is unknown whether the coverage rate would be as high in adolescents as achieved in childhood. Recently, a catch-up programme with a Meningococcal-C vaccine was performed among 10 to 12 year old adolescents and the coverage rate in this age-group appeared to be high as well (Boot et al., 2006). It is not known whether the uptake of HPV vaccination w ith a similar catch-up programme would be comparable. 3.5.5 Feasibility of implementation in the Netherlands Whether vaccination against HPV is implementa ble in the Netherlands may be influenced by several factors. First of all, the vaccine price is not yet known. This can highly influence the cost-effectiveness of vaccinati on. The preliminary Dutch study used threshold analysis to estimate at what vaccine price HPV vaccinati on becomes borderline cost-effective. They showed that the vaccine price should not be higher as \u20ac 95 per vaccine dose (Boot et al., 2006). However, as this is a preliminary analys is, these results should be interpreted with caution. Resistance to a vaccine may arise because HP V is a sexually transmitted disease (McNeil, 1997; Garnett and Waddell, 2000). Zimet (2005), on the other hand suggests that an HPV vaccine may be reasonably accepted. It will be very important to inform the general population about the relation betw een HPV-infection and cervical cancer (Quint et al., 2006). The introduction of an immunization programme against the two most prominent high-risk HPV types could make women think they are completely protected. Consequently, participation in the screening programme might reduce and the incidence of cervical cancer due to non HPV-vaccine types might increase. E ducation again is very important in this matter (Quint et al., 2006). At present, adoles cents do not yet receive any other vaccination. Hence, no infrastructure for vaccination of adolescents exis ts. According to some Dutch experts, the best way to implement the HPV vaccination among adolescent girls is by inviting them to a Municipal Health Centre. One other possibility would be that the vaccination is provided by a school physician. In both situations, problems mi ght arise with regard to informed consent, as this is needed from the parents. One option to increase the participation rate could be the combination of HPV vaccination with potential other future adolescent vaccines, such as hepatitis B vaccination (see Section 3.2). Another option could be the integration of the HPV vaccination in the DTP and BMR vaccination in 9 year old children. In the US vaccination for HPV is already page 56 of 163 RIVM report 270091004 recommended for 9 to 25 year old women. In Europe the HPV vaccine (Gardasil\u00ae) has also been licensed for men, although efficacy data on male HPV vaccina tion are lacking at present. New cervical cancer screening technologi es are developed, and the ability to test for high-risk types of HPV DNA is refi ned (Vijgen et al., 2005). In this context, it is important to study all possibilities for prev ention of cervical cancer in an integral way. All possible combinations of vaccination and screening s hould be studied in order to find the most effective and efficient prevention strategy. 3.5.6 Summary HPV vaccination of female pre-adolescents is po ssibly cost-effective. Not all interventions as found in the studies appeared to be cost-eff ective. The cost-effectiveness ratios of the interventions that were cost-effective range from US$ 12,300/QALY to US$ 24,300/QALY, depending on assumptions made. Converted to 2005 Euros, the ratios will range from \u20ac 12,225 to \u20ac 24,152 per QALY gained. Nearly all the existing cost-eff ectiveness results appeared to be sensitive to the age at which vaccination is given, vaccine efficacy, vaccine price and duration of protection. Mo re research is needed on thos e factors, as well as on the cost-effectiveness of HPV vaccination in men. The impact of the vaccination on the frequency of screening is important. Based on cu rrently available (international) data it can be concluded that universal HPV-vaccination of pre-adolescent girls in the Netherlands will only be cost-effective under certain base case as sumptions (Boot et al., 2006). The feasibility of implementation of HPV vaccination in the Netherlands depends among others on the price of the vaccine and the knowledge of parent s and adolescents about the importance of vaccination and screening. Furthermore, it is im portant to find the best way of providing the vaccine to adolescents in optima lizing the compliance among them.

Results: improving evidence on cost-effectiveness of interventions from the 2003 report 4.1 Introduction Of the 18 interventions that were listed in the 2003 report (Dirkmaat et al., 2003), eight interventions either were implemented, have f ound their way into (clini cal) guidelines, or will be implemented in the near future. The cost -effective preventive interventions that were implemented are (parts of) the National Imm unization Programme, influenza vaccination of elderly, needle exchange programmes, PKU/ CHT screening and s yphilis screening of pregnant women. Two diabetes related interv entions have found their way into clinical guidelines for the treatment of diabetes. One intervention, chla mydia screening, will possibly be implemented on a national scale in the next fe w years. For the remaining ten interventions, a literature review was carried out to improve the rather ra ndom evidence that was presented in the 2003 report. Herefore, we have used methods similar to those used for the interventions that were described in chapte r 3 of this report (see sect ion 2.2 for methods used). Using the more strict criteria, four interventions that were listed in the 2003 report had to be removed from the list of promising interventions . For two interventions it was not possible to identify three or more good-quality economic evaluations. These inte rventions were the reduction of intake of saturated fats to re duce the incidence of heart disease and the promotion of breastfeeding. Two interventions co uld not be updated for the present report because the intervention itself showed a large di versity in the way it was operationalized, as was the case with interventions to prevent fa lls of elderly people and with hepatitis A vaccination of certain groups of employees. De tails on the reason why interventions from the 2003 report were excluded in the curren t report can be found in Appendix 2. In the remainder of this chapter, update in formation is presented for the remaining six intervention from the 2003 report. The informati on is structured in a similar way as in chapter 3. 4.2 Fluoridation of drinking water 4.2.1 Description of the health problem Dental decay (caries) is a very common diseas e as almost every adult individual has one or more dental cavities, and 45% of the 5 year old children in the Netherlands have caries already in their milk teeth (Kalsbeek, 2002). Caries is not only associat ed with dental pain and the risk of tooth loss, but has a broader impact on one's health (problems with chewing, stomach complaints). The number of decayed, mi ssing, or filled teeth (DMFT-index) is used as a measure for caries experience. Because fi lled and missing teeth are included in this index, it represents the accumulated caries experience, rather th an the actual caries prevalence. Caries is related to socioeconomic status: for instan ce, children of lower educated mothers have more caries as compared to chil dren of higher educated mothers (Kalsbeek and Poorterman, 2003). In the Netherlands, dental ca ries has dramatically decreased during past page 58 of 163 RIVM report 270091004 decades and has stabilized since 1990 (Kalsb eek and Poorterman, 2003). Currently, children of 12 years of age have a mean DMFT-index of less than one (0.8) (European HFA Database, 2006). This caries reduction is at tributable to the improvement of tooth brushing behaviour in general, as well as to the widespread us e of fluoride (e.g. fluoridated toothpaste). Nevertheless, the caries problem in our country is still far fr om being solved (Kalsbeek and Poorterman, 2003). This also appears from the co st of illness figures for caries: treatment of dental caries results in total costs of \u20ac 1.6 billion (Slobbe et al., 2006). 4.2.2 Description of the intervention and the current situation in the Netherlands Fluoride decreases the acid-solubility of the teeth, which makes the teeth stronger. So, prevention of dental decay can be realized by exposing the teeth to fluoride. Different strategies to enhance fluoride levels include fluoridated toot hpastes, fluoride mouth rinses and gels, and fluoridated drinking water. The la tter strategy is implemented in many areas of the United States, and such community water fluoridation programmes (CWFP) were proven to be very effective (Truman et al., 2001). Water fluoridation even appears on the CDCs (Center for Disease Control and Prevention) li st of ten great public health achievements (together with e.g. immunizations, sa fer and healthier foods, et cetera.) (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtm l/00056796.htm). McDonagh et al. (2000) found that water fluoridation was associated with an increase of almost 15% in the proportion of children without caries, and a DMFT reduc tion of 2.25. Moreover, the evidence suggests that water fluoridation has a beneficial effect over and above that of fluoridated toothpaste (and other sources of fluoride) (McDonagh et al., 2000). According to McDonagh and colleagues, there is some evidence that water fluoridation reduces sociodemographic inequalities. McDonagh et al. ( 2000) also investigated the possible negative effects. There was only one statistically signifi cant negative effect of fluorida tion: dental fluorosis (ranging from some white spots on the teeth, to brow n coloration of the te eth). A dose-response relationship was identified, with a prevalence fo r fluorosis of aesthetic concern of 12.5% at a fluoride level of 1 ppm (McDonagh et al., 2000). During the 1960s and 1970s the drinking water in the Netherlands was fluoridated. Due to societal resistance the underlying law was not extended in 1976. So, currently, in the Neth erlands the water is not fluoridated. As in other countries, almost all toot hpastes are fluoridated nowadays. 4.2.3 Results from economic evaluation studies Four studies that evaluated the costs and be nefits of drinking wa ter fluoridation were included (Appendix 7, Table 7.1). All studies concluded that CWFPs are cost-saving. The most recent study was performed by O'Conne ll et al. (2005). This study estimated the net costs of a CWFP by comparing the progr amme costs with the treatment savings associated with prevented tooth decay. It was assumed that a CWFP was implemented if the difference between natural fluoride concentr ation of water and recommended fluoride concentration (CDC-recommendation varies be tween 0.7 and 1.2 ppm) was at least 0.3 ppm. It was assumed that the adverse effects of e xposure to water fluoridation were negligible. Furthermore, productivity losses due to morbid ity were not included. The authors conclude that CWFPs were associated with net savings (BCR 22:1 to 135:1). The net savings were most sensitive to changes in CWFP effectiven ess and the decay increment in nonfluoridated areas. Nevertheless, all variations in the sensi tivity analysis resulted in net savings. One of the comments of the authors is that the savi ngs due to CWFP are reduced as use of other fluoride recources (e.g. fluoridated toothpaste) increases. Griffin et al. (2001) also calculated RIVM report 270091004 page 59 of 163 the net savings of water fluoridation as the cost s of water fluoridation minus the savings from averted tooth decay. They included only benefi ts for people between 5 and 65 years of age, and neglected any adverse eff ects of fluoridation. The author s found that water fluoridation was cost-saving, and that their findings were very robust to variations in parameters. Community water fluoridation was still cost-s aving under worst case scenarios (except for very small communities (fewer than 5,000 peopl e)). Wright et al. (2001) focussed on the minimum population size for which oral health benefits from water fluoridation would be greater than the costs of that fluoridation programme. Net savings were calculated. Due to the absence of data, the effectiveness of fluoridat ion was limited to people less than 35 years of age. Fluoridation appeared to be cost-sav ing for communities of 1,000 people and above, especially in communities with a high proportion of children or a low socioeconomic status. Birch (1990) evaluated the costs of water fluoridation in relation to its effect on caries. They concluded that water fluoridation would cost \u00a3 1.60-19.46 per reduced DMFT person year. All assumptions in this analysis were biased against fluoridation, so th e findings probably are underestimating the actual cost-eff ectiveness of water fluoridation. 4.2.4 Transferability of foreign study results to Dutch context Systematic reviews and economic evaluations conclude that water fluoridation is safe, effective, and cost-effective. The conclusion of the cost-effectiveness studies that water fluoridation is cost-effective is anticipated to be transferable to the Netherlands, but not without adjustments for the Dutch situation. In the country, water fluoridation would prevent a substantial proportion of the bur den of disease caused by dental caries, and of the costs of dental caries, which are estimated at \u20ac 1.6 bill ion in the Netherlands (Slobbe et al., 2006). Nevertheless, over the last decades caries pr evalence declined, largely attributed to the widespread use of fluoridated toothpaste. Si nce the (cost-)effectiveness of fluoridation depends inter alia on caries incidence, the que stion may be raised whether water fluoridation would still be (cost-)effective nowadays. Howe ver, even the most recent economic evaluation shows that the additional protect ive effect of fluoridated dri nking water is still significant (notwithstanding the use of fluoridated toothpaste). Furthermore, cost-effectiveness also appear ed to be dependent on the natural fluoride concentration of drinking water in the area. This natural concentration is very low in the Netherlands (<0.3 ppm (Versteegh, 2005)), which would have a positive effect on the cost- effectiveness of the fluoridation of drinking water in our country. 4.2.5 Feasibility of implementation in the Netherlands The implementation of fluoridation of drinki ng water is practically feasible, by adding a controlled dose of a fluoride compound to the dr inking water. This c ould be realized at relatively low cost. On the other hand, th ere are also several major barriers for implementation. In the first place, at present th e addition of chemicals to drinking water is prohibited by law in the Netherlands. This la w came into effect because it was widely perceived that drinking water should not be used as a vehicle for pharmaceuticals. Furthermore, fluoridation of drinking water would conflict with the freedom to choose for natural drinking water. This pr inciple of freedom of choice is considered as an important basic principle in the Netherlands. page 60 of 163 RIVM report 270091004 4.2.6 Summary Fluoridation of drinking water in the Netherlands would probably be cost-saving as the costs of fluoridation will be outweighed by the savings due to reduction of caries. However, people would also run the risk of fluorosis (of aesth etic concern). Although pr actically feasible, the many objections against fluoridation of dri nking water make its implementation rather improbable. Cost-effectiveness: ** Transferability : * Implementation: * 4.3 Folic acid fortification of staple foods 4.3.1 Description of the health problem In the Netherlands, it is estimated that 2.4% of all liveborn babies have a major congenital abnormality demanding medical care during the fi rst year of life (EUROCAT, 2005). One of the most common congenital disord ers is a neural tube defect (NTD). A NTD results from a failure of closure of the neur al tube during early embryogene sis. The two most frequent NTDs are anencephaly and spina bifida (North rup and Volcik, 2000). Anen cephaly is a lethal condition, and the viability of infants with spin a bifida is determined by the type of lesion. The symptoms of spina bifida vary from very mild symptoms to incontinence, paralysis, and hydrocephalus. The total birth prevalence (i.e. including live births, st illbirths and induced abortions) of NTD in Europe is about 1 in 1000 (EUROCAT, 2000; Cornel, 2003). 4.3.2 Description of the intervention and the current situation in the Netherlands Folate is needed to replicate DNA, and for th e production and maintenance of new cells. This is especially important during periods of rapi d cell division and growth such as pregnancy. Folate deficiency hinders DNA synthesis and cell division. Improving th e folate status in pregnant women was proven to reduce the risk of NTDs (MRC, 1991). An adequate folate status, achieved by the intake of synthetic folic acid, can result in the pr evention of more than two thirds of all NTDs (MRC, 1991). Several strate gies to reach an adequate folate status for effective prevention of these birth defects exist. These include promotion of the use of oral folic acid supplements several weeks before and after conception, and mandatory folic acid fortification of staple foods . Most European countries (i ncluding the Netherlands) have adopted the former strategy (Bus by et al., 2005). In the northern provinces of the Netherlands a reduction in NTD prevalence in 2000-2002 was shown as compared to 1989-1991 (Busby et al., 2005). Moreover, a Dutc h study found that the cost-effe ctiveness of this current strategy was \u20ac1800 in the base case and remain ed below \u20ac 4500 in the sensitivity analysis (Postma et al., 2002). However, in Europe th e supplementation strategy has not led to a substantial decline in the prevalence of NTDs (Busby et al ., 2005). This suggests that a policy of recommending periconceptional folic acid supp lementation may not be very effective. In other countries (e.g. US, Canada, Chili, et cete ra) the strategy of mandatory folic acid fortification was implemented. In these count ries, the blood folate status has improved following the fortification of flour with folic acid, and NTD rates fell by 19-78% (Eichholzer et al., 2006). RIVM report 270091004 page 61 of 163 4.3.3 Results from economic evaluation studies Three studies were found that i nvestigated the cost-effectiven ess of mandatory folic acid fortification of staple foods for the prevention of NTDs (App endix 7, Table 7.2). All studies were performed in the US, and they all conclude d that folic acid fortification is cost-saving. Grosse et al. (2005) performed an ex post economic evaluation of mandatory folic acid fortification of cereal grain pr oducts. The fortificati on strategy was found to be cost-saving, even in the worst case scenario. Fortification costs $ 3 million per year in the US, and the averted NTDs result in a total societal benef it of $ 312 to $ 425 million, and in a savings of $88 to $146 million on direct medical costs. Ke lly et al. (1996) calculated the cost- effectiveness of both the supplementation strategy and several fortifica tion strategies (ranging from 140 to 700 mcg folic acid per 100 g grain). Fortification, at all levels investigated, resulted in overall cost-savings as well as in gains in QALYs. The supplementation strategy gained more QALYs than fortification at 140 mc g of folic acid, but it would cost more than any of the fortification strate gies. Fortification with 700 mcg folic acid per 100 g grain would result in cost-savings of about $ 13,000 ($ 7000 - $ 14,000) per QALY gained. Romano et al. (1995) compared the economic costs and benefits of fortifying grain with folic acid to prevent NTDs. By averting costly birth defects, fortific ation would be expected to yield net economic benefits. The best estimate of the benefit to cost ratio is 4.3:1 for low-level fortification (140 mcg/100 fortific ation (350 mcg folic acid per 100 g grain). In the US these strategies would result in a net economic benefit of $ 94 or $ 252 million, respectively. The costs per case averted woul d be $ 92,000 for the low-level strategy and $ 65,000 for the high-level strategy. This study also included the estimation of the cost- effectiveness of the voluntary use of folic aci d supplements. This strategy would result in $ 132,000 per NTD case averted. Hence, in this study fortification was found to be more cost-effective than supplementation. No cost-effectiveness study on the combination of fortification and supplementation was found. 4.3.4 Transferability of foreign study results to Dutch context Since folic acid fortification of staple foods is a relatively chea p intervention, and the benefits in terms of savings due to prevented NTD cases outweigh the costs of fo rtification, all studies concluded that mandatory folic acid fortification would be cost-saving. However, the studies only evaluated the effect of folic acid fortification on the birth prevalence of neural tube defects. They i gnored the increasing evid ence about other - both beneficial and adverse - effects of folic acid. Recent studies sugge st that folic acid has diverse health effects in individuals (Kloosterman et al., 2006; Verhoef and Katan, 2006; Cornel et al., 2005; Van Amsterdam et al., 2004). These st udies report the following positive effects: prevention of other birth defects, improve d fertility, prevention of (recurrence of) cardiovascular disease, prevention of some cancers, prevention of cognitive decline and dementia, and prevention of anemia. The reporte d negative effects are: increased cancer risk (at high levels of folic acid), masking of vitamin-B 12 deficiency, and promotion of tumor progression. Although there is much uncertainty a bout some of these supposed effects, others are more evidence based and should be taken in to account in current economic evaluations of food fortification. Inclusion of th e potential adverse effects of folic acid might result in lower cost-effectiveness estimates as compared to the abovementioned studies that only included the preventive effect of folic acid on NTDs (the economic evaluations only included the risk of masking a vitamin-B 12 deficiency). On the other hand, inclusion of the other favourable effects could lead to even larger benefits. Th erefore, the results of the described economic evaluations should be considered as incomplete to fully assess the cost-effectiveness of page 62 of 163 RIVM report 270091004 fortification and supplementation, given the ra pidly increasing knowledge on all effects of folic acid. It seems that the bene ficial effects of folic acid (e .g. prevention of NTDs), should be balanced against adverse eff ects of folic acid (e.g. promotion of cancer). An assessment of the current evidence for all related diseases is needed before a risk-benefit analysis for all potential effects can be performed. Current ly, quantitative risk benefit assessment methodologies are under de velopment at the RIVM. 4.3.5 Feasibility of implementation in the Netherlands The current policy in the Netherlands implies th e promotion of pericon ceptional use of folic acid supplements. Although this is a cost-effec tive strategy in the Netherlands (\u20ac 1800/life year gained) (Postma et al., 2002), folic acid fo rtification of foods ma y be cost-saving and more effective (i.e. leading to a larger reduction of the prevalence of NTDs). At present in the Netherlands, about two thirds of the target group uses supplemen ts, but only one third uses it the entire advised period (C ornel, 2002; Meijer and De Walle, 2005). Contrary, mandatory food fortification would increase the folate status of ever y woman of childbearing age. Concurrently, the exposure of non-target groups (e.g. men) in the population will become higher. Besides, since the use of folic aci d supplements is lower among women of lower socioeducational status (Busby et al., 2005), mandatory food fortification might decrease socioeconomic inequalities in NTD prevalence (Eichholzer et al., 2006). Technically, the implementation of folic acid fortification of grains is not a problem. However, there are several objections agains t such a mandatory food fortification. These include the above mentioned possible health risks related to raising the folate status of the total population. Furthermore, it is suggested that there is a lack of recognition of the public health importance of NTDs. This may be related to the fact that the great majority of NTDs pregnancies are now terminated in many Europ ean countries, rendering them invisible to all but the affected families (EUROCAT, 2005). Fina lly, mandatory food fortification raises the issue of autonomy and freedom of choice (Corne l, 2005). Mandatory fortification of flour can be limited to part of the products, which can be la beled, so that the possibility to decide to eat unfortified foods remains. In the US, whole wh eat flour is not fortified for this reason. 4.3.6 Summary The results of the cost-effectiven ess analyses suggest that manda tory folic acid fortification of staple foods would be cost-s aving with regard to the prevention of NTDs. However, recent evidence on other favourable and harmful eff ects of folic acid was not included in the economic evaluations. Further resear ch is needed to gain more in sight into the diverse effects of folic acid. Such a risk-benefit analysis should be the basis of future comprehensive economic evaluations of mandatory folic acid fortification and supplementation. Cost-effectiveness: ** Transferability : * * 4.4 Vaccination against vari cella zoster virus 4.4.1 Description of the health problem Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is one of the most infectious viruses; 80-90% of exposed seronegative persons will develop varicella dis ease (chickenpox). In th e Netherlands, 49% of RIVM report 270091004 page 63 of 163 2-years-old children have had chickenpox. This seroprevalence increases to 93% for 5-years- olds, and 98% for those over 6 years of age (De Me lker et al., 2006). The vast majority of the cases occurs during childhood and has only mild symptoms: fever and generalized pruritic rash. The most frequent complication is bacteria l superinfection of the skin, lungs or bones. In individuals with decreased immunity, chic kenpox may have a more severe course with serious morbidity and even mortality. Moreove r, pregnant women who develop varicella have a 2% risk that the baby will be a ffected with congenital varicella syndrome (abnormalities, mental retardation) . Reactivation of the latent infection of VZV established during a childhood chickenpox infection can cause shingles later in life. Chickenpox causes about 40,000 GP consultations, 200 hospital admi ssions, and 2.3 deaths each year (De Melker et al., 2006). So, although VZV infections are generally mild and self-limiting, due to their high incidence among children they give rise to considerable morbidity and, occasionally, mortality. 4.4.2 Description of the intervention and the current situation in the Netherlands Prevention of chickenpox is possible by means of vaccination against VZV1. The Oka- vaccine is currently available as a single-compone nt vaccine, and clinical studies show that vaccine efficacy is 70-100% (Boot et al., 2006). Recently, the vaccine is registered in many European countries, including the Netherlands. Cu rrently, VZV vaccination is not included in the National Immunization Programme (NIP). The effectiveness of varicella vaccination decreases over time from 97% in the first year to 84% in the years 2-8 (Vazquez et al., 2004). The frequency of breakthrough infections wi ll be reduced after a two-dose schedule. However, a second varicella vaccination after 1- 3 months would require an adaptation of the NIP, since the second MMR-vaccination (Measles, Mumps and Rubella) is given at 9 years of age (Boot et al., 2006). 4.4.3 Results from economic evaluation studies Many economic evaluations of universal chil dhood varicella vaccination programmes were performed. A study of Thiry et al. (2003) review ed cost-effectiveness an alyses up to the end of 2002. Below, the results of this review, as well as the result s of five individual economic evaluations that were performed afte r 2002, are summarized (Appendix 7, Table 7.3). With regard to universal vacci nation of children, Thiry et al. (2003) concluded that, in spite of the diversity in assumptions, all included studies point in the same direction: compared to no vaccination, universal varicella vaccination w ould generate indirect savings to society (mean benefit to cost ratio of about 4:1). This conclusion was sensitive to the vaccine price and the value assigned to producti vity losses of parents. Accord ing to Thiry and colleagues, vaccination would not generate savings from the healthcare payer's perspective. The study by Hsu et al. (2003) al so reported cost-savings from the societal perspective, but not from the health care payer's perspective. Recent studies of Coudeville et al. (2004 and 2005), Ginsberg and Somekh (2004), and Banz et al. (2003), in Italy, France and Germany, Israel, and Germany, respectively, reported th at universal childhood va ricella vaccination would be cost-saving from both perspectives (although considerably le ss cost-savings from the healthcare payer's perspective were reported). This difference between the two perspectives is related to the productivity losses associated wi th parents' absence from work 1 See De Melker HE, Gerritsen AAM, Hahn\u00e9 SJM (Eds.) for further discussion on this subject. page 64 of 163 RIVM report 270091004 while caring for their sick children. These cost s are generally only included in the societal perspective, and not in the h ealthcare payer's perspective. Br isson et al. (2003) was the only included study that reported a loss of QALYs due to the vaccination. While all other studies assumed that childhood vaccination does not influe nce the epidemiology of zoster (shingles), Brisson et al., assumed that vari cella vaccination would increase this incidence. Since zoster is a more severe disease, having larger QALY losses than varicella, a small increase could wipe out QALY gains from varicella reductions. Hence, this study did not support the cost- effectiveness of varicella vaccination. 4.4.4 Transferability of foreign study results to Dutch context A major point of uncertainty in the assessment of the cost-effectiveness of universal varicella vaccination is the potential effect of vaccination on the incidence of zoster later in life (Boot et al., 2006). It is suggested that a decrease in chickenpox inci dence will cause a temporal increase of the incidence of shingles (Brisson et al., 2003; Go ldman, 2005). If this rise in zoster incidence will occur, va ricella vaccination will not be cost-effective for the first 50 years. However, there is no consensus c oncerning this anticipated zoster increase (Hammerschmidt et al., 2004; Jum aan et al., 2005). So, as long as there is uncertainty about the effect on zoster epidemiology, definite conclusions about the cost-effectiveness of varicella vaccination can not be drawn. Furthe rmore, the morbidity of chickenpox increases with age (Boot et al., 2006). In the Netherlands , the mean age of sero conversion is relatively low, and thus, the burden of disease caused by varicella is relatively low. The GP consultations and hospital admissions for ch ickenpox are lower than in other European countries (Boot et al., 2006). This lower burde n of disease (less severe cases) will make varicella vaccination in the Netherlands le ss cost-effective in co mparison with other countries. To check whether or not the burden of disease figures are an underestimation, the RIVM is currently collecting data about the actual incidence of complications due to chickenpox. 4.4.5 Feasibility of implementation in the Netherlands All studies evaluated the cost -effectiveness of one separate vaccination, while currently a tetravalent MMRV vaccine is available. In the future, the MMR vaccine in the NIP could be replaced by a MMRV vaccine. The use of such a combination vaccine could have a positive effect on the coverage rate of varicella vaccination. On the other hand, a recent study found that only 22% of the parents reported that th ey would have their children vaccinated against chickenpox (Van de Bovenkamp-Meijer and R\u00fcmk e, 2005). Dutch parents seem to perceive chickenpox as a benign, mild disease. Inclusion of vaccination for a disease that is perceived as a mild disease could have an effect on the uptake of other vaccinations within the NIP as well. Such an effect should be taken into account while consider ing the introduction of universal varicella vaccination. Furthermore, a second vaccination in the second live-year will prevent frequent breakthrough infections (Boot et al., 2006). However, such a second vaccination is not easily implementable in th e current NIP, as the second MMR vaccination at present is given at 9 year s of age (Boot et al., 2006). 4.4.6 Summary In conclusion, universal chil dhood varicella vaccination could prevent most morbidity and mortality due to chickenpox. Based on internat ional literature , it is expected that the introduction of varicella vacci nation in the NIP could be cost-effective from a healthcare payer perspective and possibly ev en cost-saving from a societal perspective. Nevertheless, RIVM report 270091004 page 65 of 163 the actual cost-effectiveness depends on several as pects that are still uncertain at the moment. These factors include the actual burden of di sease caused by chickenpox in the Netherlands, the effect of varicella vaccination on zoster incidence, and on MMR coverage. Furthermore, a second varicella vaccination to prevent fre quent breakthrough infections requires major changes in the NIP. Cost-effectiveness: ** Transferability: * Implementation: * 4.5 Stop smoking interventions 4.5.1 Description of the health problem Smoking increases the risk of many diseases, su ch as lung cancer, COPD, and cardiovascular diseases. In the Netherlands, smoking is the risk factor with the highest burden of disease, being related to about 13% of the total amount of DALYs (De Hollande r et al., 2006). About 30% of coronary heart disease mortality and about 14% of stroke mortality is caused by smoking. Approximately 11% of stomach cancer cases is caused by smoking (Tr\u00e9daniel et al., 1997). Furthermore, 3.7% of the total cost s of illness are attributable to smoking (De Hollander et al., 2006). In the Netherla nds, 28% of the population smoked in 2005 (Willemsen, 2005). 4.5.2 Description of the intervention and current situation in the Netherlands Tobacco control potentially decreases the burde n of disease substant ially. Tobacco control policy aims at reducing the number of smokers , either by increasing smoking cessation or by decreasing the initiation of sm oking. This section, focuses on cessation of smoking in adults, because most evidence exists in this field (F eenstra et al., 2005a). For many smokers, it is hard to quit smoking on will power alone. Only 3-7% of the smokers who attempt to stop smoking on will power are still ab stinent after one year (Zhu et al., 2000; Willemsen et al., 2003). A wide range of policy measures and therapie s is targeted at the increase of this rate. Two types of interventions can be distinguished, the individual ones (i.e. self-help manuals, intensive counselling combined with pharmaceu tical therapies) and the ones on population level (such as price increases by taxation, media campaigns and regulation) (Feenstra et al., 2005a). Since the report of Dirkmaat et al. (2003) focused mainly on i ndividual interventions from which GP counselling appeared to be most cost-effective, this section focuses on GP counselling as well. GP counselling can be prov ided in a minimal way (often called minimal counselling or 'Kort stopadvies' in Dutch) or in a more intensiv e way (often called structured GP counselling or 'H-MIS' in Dutch). Minima l counselling means short counselling by a GP or assistant in one consult that is not necessarily aimed to stop smoking or associated with smoking related diseases. Structured GP c ounselling implies counselling in one or two consults following a protocol (Feenstra et al., 2005a). GP counselling can be combined with either nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) with patches or gum or with Bupropion, which is medication to support a person who wants to quit smoking. page 66 of 163 RIVM report 270091004 4.5.3 Results of economic evaluations Five economic evaluation studies on smoki ng cessation (Appendix 7, Table 7.4) were included. One of the five studies took place in the Netherlands (Feenstra et al., 2005b). A more recent version of this study, which took account of health care costs for substitute diseases and relapse of quitters also more th an one year after cessation (Feenstra et al., 2005a) is used. Feenstra et al. (2005a) performe d a cost-effectiveness study in wh ich the cost-eff ectiveness of implementing several tobacco cessation interv entions in the Netherlands was estimated. Minimal counselling and structur ed GP counselling appeared to be the most cost-effective individual interventions, w ith ratios of respectively \u20ac 9,100 and \u20ac 8,800 per QALY gained. When nicotine replacement therapy was adde d to the GP counselling the ratio was \u20ac 13,400 per QALY gained. No combination of GP counselling with Bupropion was included in this study because insufficient evidence on effectiven ess (12 months sustained abstinence) was found for that combination. The ratios are conser vative estimates because all future health care costs are included, including the savings from a reduced incidence of smoking related diseases and the extra health care costs for substitute diseases in longer life. Cornuz et al. (2006) studied the cost-effectiven ess of GP counselling and several nicotine replacement therapies (g um, patch, inhaler and spray) in six countries (Canada, France, Spain, Switzerland, United Kingdom and United St ates) for men and women separately. The ratios varied from $ 1,758 per LYG for men in Spain (patch) to $ 8,700 per LYG for women in France (inhaler). In another study by Cornuz et al. (2003) the co st-effectiveness ratios were determined for pharmacotherapy (nicotine replacement therapy or Bupropion) compared to GP counselling in Switzerland. The cost per LYS for c ounselling only was about \u20ac 600. The cost- effectiveness ratios for nicotine replacement therapy (gum and patches) varied from \u20ac 3,113 to 8799 per LYG 3,646 per LYG for Bupropion. Only direct medical costs were included. For Bupropion effectiveness data were used from a study that examined the combination with intensive counselling. Song et al. (2002) evaluated adding pharm acotherapy (nicotine replacement therapy, Bupropion or both) to counselling alone in the UK. Costs per LYG were about $1,441 for nicotine replacement therapy and $ 920 for Bupropion. The impact of smoking cessation on long-term medical expenditure was not considered. The role of discounting in the calculation of the LYG was unclear in this study. Stapleton et al. (1999) compared GP counselli ng with nicotine replacement therapy (nicotine patches) with only. The incr emental cost-effectiveness ratio of nicotine patches counselling counselling alone varied from \u00a3 398 per LYG (under 35 years) to \u00a3 785 per LYG (55- 65 years). Results were quite robust to changes in both cost and effectiveness estimates. The variables with th e greatest impact were the 12-month cessation rate attributable to the intervention and the cost of nicotine patches. 4.5.4 Transferability of foreign study results to the Dutch situation There are two concerns with resp ect to the transferability of the results from foreign studies to the Dutch situation. First, the reference scen arios do not exactly reflect the Dutch situation. For example, Song et al. (2002) assumed brief ad vice or counselling as the basic comparator, whereas this is not th e current practice in the Netherla nds. Second, although foreign studies concluded that GP counselling in combination with Bupropion would be cost-effective, for the Netherlands no sufficient evidence was f ound to support the use of that combination (Feenstra et al., 2005a). RIVM report 270091004 page 67 of 163 The Dutch study has some advantages compar ed to the other studies. Firstly, besides intervention costs, Feenstra et al. (2005a) al so included both the savings for smoking related diseases and the additional costs of health car e resulting from an incr ease in life expectancy. Most studies simply compared intervention co sts to health outcomes. Secondly, the Dutch evaluation study covered a broad range of interv entions (the individual ones and the ones on population level), evaluating them all in a si milar way. Thirdly, Feenstra et al. (2005a) included relapse rates that depe nd on the time since quit smoking, and smoking prevalence is described as a result of age dependent star t rates, and age dependent cessation rates, combined with relapse rates that depend on time since quitting. 4.5.5 Feasibility of implementation in the Netherlands From a practical viewpoint, implementation of GP counselling aiming at smoking cessation will not be difficult. In the Netherlands, smoking cessation counselling ('H-MIS') is already part of the guidelines for GPs. However, in 2005 only 45% of the GPs applied the H-MIS to at least one of their patients (Jacobs-van der Bruggen et al., 2006). In a report (2006) of the Dutch Institute for Public Health and the Enviro nment, it was estimated that only 2-7% of the smokers is reached by GP counselling in the Netherlands, while 63-65% could be maximal reached (theoretically) should GP counselling be implemented optimally (Vijgen et al., 2006). A shortage of time and a lack of exper tise are reasons why GP s do not often give advice about smoking cessation (Frijling a nd Van der Laan, 2000; Schroeder, 2005). The effectiveness of GP counselling depe nds also on the smoker's willingness and compliance. In 2005, 25% of the smokers mentione d they wanted to stop within a year, 15% of the smokers wanted to stop somewhere in th e future, 13% never wants to quit and 47% did not know. Taking this into account, a reasonabl e reach of the individual GP interventions would be a maximum of 30% of the smokers (Vijgen et al., 2006). Although GP counselling was found to be co st-effective in comparison to the current situation in the Netherlands, the study of Feenstra et al. (2005a ) showed that tax increase was the most cost-effective intervention. However, tax measures were not under study here, because this was not considered in the former report of Dirkmaat et al. (2003) and besides that, tax increases were carried out already. 4.5.6 Summary In the Netherlands, smoking is the risk factor th at is associated with the highest burden of disease. Smoking increases the risk of many diseases, such as lung cancer and COPD. The examined studies conclude that smoking cessation interventions, either GP counselling alone, or GP counselling in combination with nicotine replacement therapy would be cost-effective. Less evidence was found for GP counselling in combination with Bupropion. A concern with respect to the transferability of the results from foreign studies to the Dutch situation is that the reference scenarios do not exactly reflec t the Dutch situation. Implementation of GP counselling aiming at smoking cessation in the Ne therlands is not easy. A shortage of time and a lack of expertise are reasons why GPs do not often give advice about smoking cessation. Besides, the effectiveness depends to a large extent on the compliance of smokers as well.

Typical clinical features of influenza include: feve r, respiratory symptoms (such as, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose), headache, musc le aches, and extreme fatigue. Some people, older people in particular, develop seri ous and potentially life-threatening medical complications, like pneumonia. This can be viral pneumonia, in which the influenza virus itself spreads into the lungs, or bacterial pneum onia, in which unrelated bacteria (such as pneumococci, see also section 4.7) attack the person's weakened defenses. Most influenza virus infections are transmitted via virus-laden respiratory droplets. Influenza viruses are divided into three subtypes: A, B and C. Only the first two types cause important illness and are responsible for the annual epidemics. Only type A has been responsible for pandemics. Influenza epidemics in temperate climates tend to occur on an annual basis. In the Netherlands, the season can st art as early as mid-November or as late as the beginning of March. In recent years, the most prevalent episode was January-March. The incidence figures fluctuate considerably each year , because of viral drift: the virus mutates its outer coating from year to year. In 2006, the incidence was 1.6/100,000 (Dijkstra et al., 2006). In the age-group 20-64, the average season al incidence of influenza is somewhat lower. Complications of influenza infections are uncommon in this age-group. Therefore, in this age-group admissions to hospital and mort ality as a result of influenza are uncommon. However, during each annual influenza epidemic, infections result in significant burden of illness among healthy working adults, especially in terms of absenteeism from work. 4.6.2 Description of the intervention and the current situation in the Netherlands In the Netherlands, influenza vaccination is particularly recommended for those who are at high risk for developing serious complications as a result of an influenza infection1. These high-risk groups include all people aged 65 years and older and people of any age with chronic diseases of the heart, lung or kidneys, diab etes, or immunosuppressed persons. In the Netherlands there is no national influenza v accination plan focuse d on healthy working adults. However, in some organizations employ ees are offered to take part in influenza vaccination programmes, especially in nursing homes and hospitals. The Dutch organization of nursing home doctors and social geriat ricians recommends annual vaccination of employees of nursing homes and rest homes (NVVA, 2004). The main treatment for influenza is to rest adequately, drink plenty of fluids, and avoid exertion. Sometimes, antiviral medication is give n, in particular to the following groups of people: non-vaccinated people from high-risk groups, vaccinated people with decreased capacity for antibody production and high risk-groups in case the vaccine appears not to match with circulating influenza strains. Circulating influenza viruses are subject to permanent cha nges in strains which require annual adaptation of the influenza vaccine formulation. Updates in influenza vaccine composition should ensure the closest possible match between the infl uenza vaccine strains and the circulating influenza strains; ensuri ng this match is one of the foundations for 1 See De Melker HE, Gerritsen AAM, Hahn\u00e9 SJM (Eds.) for further discussion on this subject. RIVM report 270091004 page 69 of 163 influenza vaccine efficacy. To what extent this match can be made differs from year to year. Because the influenza viruses differ from year to year, annual vaccination is required. 4.6.3 Results economic evaluations Studies about influenza vaccinati on of the whole population (all hea lthy adults) are left out of consideration. Only studies a bout immunization programmes that are focused on people that work are examined. In total six studies are included, of which none is performed in the Netherlands (Appendix 7, Table 7.5). Five of th em conclude that vacc ination will lead to cost-savings. A sixth study calculated the brea k-even price of the vaccine, estimating the threshold price at which vaccina tion would be cost-neutral (N ichol et al., 2003). All studies used a societal perspective. Four of the studies included in this review ar e simulation studies. One of these (Rothberg and Rose, 2005) was specifically focused on occupati onal health services and primary care. The other studies did not specify the branch wh ich was under study (Nic hol, 2001; Lee et al., 2002; Das Gupta and Guest, 2000). Further re viewed studies were one randomized, double- blind, placebo-controlled study (Nichol et al ., 2003) and one observational study (Campbell and Rumley, 1997). Nichol et al. (2003) did their study on employ ees that were enrolled from 13 recruitment centers. Campbell and Rumley ( 1997) performed a prospective study in textile plants and outcomes were compared with thos e of unvaccinated workers in three other plants. Five studies were performed from the societal perspective and one from the perspective of the employer (Das Gupta and Guest, 2002). All st udies included indirect costs of production losses as a result of influenza episodes and ofte n, studies include lost work-time for receiving the vaccine. Cost-savings are strongly related to the inclusion of indire ct costs and benefits related to production losses and gains. When excluding these indirect benefits, none of the studies remains cost-saving. Next to direct costs, most studies (Nichol , 2001; Lee et al., 2002; Nichol et al., 2003; Rothberg and Rose, 2005) consider indirect non- medical costs of vaccination, i.e. worker's time needed to get vaccinated. The assumed extent of time investment depends on the organization of administrating the vaccine; at the work place or at the local GP. Studies differed with respect to the assumed or observed efficacy of the influenza vaccine. The lowest efficacy (24-59%) was used in th e observational study of Campbell and Rumley (1997) and the highest efficacy number used was 75% (Nichol, 2001), although this efficacy was only assumed for years with a good match. All of the studies in cluded a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the effects of key para meters on the estimated outcomes. Most studies included efficacy and vaccine price in these es timates. Those studies that concluded that immunization is cost-saving concluded that this result is sensitive to the assumed efficacy of the vaccine. Here, a very important aspect of influenza vaccination has to be emphasized, namely the annually different content of the vacc ine. Each year, the viruses that are expected to be most virulent are included in the vacci ne. As it is not known on forehand which viruses will be most prevalent in a certain influenza season, the vaccine effectiveness will change from year to year. This will inherently influe nce the cost-effectiveness of vaccination from one influenza season to the other. Therefore, it is difficult to predict the cost-effectiveness of influenza vaccination with a high probability. 4.6.4 Transferability foreign study results to the Dutch situation Study results on the cost-effectiveness of influen za vaccination are well transferable to the Dutch situation in general. However, there is one concern. Economic be nefits highly depend on the number of workers that choose for vaccina tion. In most of the considered studies a coverage rate of 100% is assumed. This assumption may be unrealistic. A study about page 70 of 163 RIVM report 270091004 vaccination in nursing homes in the Netherlands showed that the coverage rate was about 10% in the 2004/2005 season (Van der Sande et al., 2006). Furthermore, there are some more general issues that endanger the outc omes of the reviewed studies. Whether the expected costs of imm unization counterbalance the benefits from decreased absenteeism depends on several factor s. Firstly, the type and seriousness of the influenza virus in a certain season determine the benefits from i mmunization (Nichol and Mendelman, 2004). Secondly, assumptions that ar e made about the degree of absenteeism and productivity losses due to influenza infect ions may be unrealisti c. A recent Cochrane review showed that vaccination of healthy adults would be effective, but leads to an average decrease of only 0.2 day absenteeism (Dem ichelli et al., 2005). Moreover, a good match between the vaccine and the ci rculating influenza strain is a precondition for acceptable outcomes in economic terms. This is sometimes not the case, resulting in a small mean effect (Demichelli et al., 2005). 4.6.5 Feasibility of implementation in the Netherlands In practice, it will not be difficult to offer the possibility of vaccinating healthy working adults in the Netherlands. Currently, employers can already offer influenza vaccination to their employees (usually at th e workplace). The immunization is mainly organized by offices for workplace safety ('arbodiensten') and there are several commercial influenza vaccination services. However, there are some factor s that will hamper the implementation of vaccination. Since influenza has a relatively harm less course for people that do not belong to the high-risk groups, and vaccination is only partly effective, vaccination is not indispensable. As vaccination coverage is al ways strongly associated with perceptions of the severity of disease, one can exp ect that this will also be th e case for influenza vaccination. Although studies showed that indire ct benefits of averted produc tion losses were important to the cost-effectiveness of the in tervention, also non-economic reasons may be important. It is argued that vaccinating working adults could have extra benefits of increasing vaccine coverage among high-risk working adults and po tential external benefi ts (increasing herd immunity) if workers are in occupations requi ring a high level of contact with high-risk groups (for example health-care workers). Howe ver, vaccinating health -care workers did not appear efficacious against influenza among the el derly people they care for in institutions (Thomas et al., 2006). 4.6.6 Summary Although complications of in fluenza infections are uncommon among healthy working adults, infections result in a significant burden of illness, especially in terms of absenteeism from work. Most studies conclude that vaccinatio n will lead to cost-savings when the societal perspective is chosen. Economic benefits hi ghly depend on the number of workers that choose for vaccination, the actual match for th e season, the virulence of the circulating strains, and the degree of absenteeism and produc tivity losses due to infl uenza infections. In practice, it will not be difficult to offer v accination to healthy working adults in the Netherlands. However, vaccination coverage is always strongly associated with perceptions of the severity of disease, and since influenza is in general not perceived to be a serious health threat, one can expect that this will also be the case for influenza vaccination. Cost-effectiveness: * Transferability: * Implementation: ** RIVM report 270091004 page 71 of 163 4.7 Pneumococcal vaccination of elderly persons 4.7.1 Description of health problem Pneumococcal disease is caused by an infection with the bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus). There are at least ni nety different kinds (serotypes) of the pneumococcus. Only a limited number of serotypes cause the majority of severe pneumococcal diseases. Infections with the pneumococcus can be either invasive or noninvasive. The invasive inf ections occur as septicem ia, meningitis and pneumonia associated with bacteria in the blood (bacteremia). Streptococcus pneumoniae causes also noninvasive pneumococcal infections, such as bacterial pneumonia, mucosal infections, like inflammation of the middle ear (otitis media) and sinusitis. The disease develops in only a small proportion of the infected persons, esp ecially in young children, the elderly, and people with low immunity. A total of 5-20% of the pneumococcal pneumonia is complicated with a bacteremia. The incidence of pneumococcal bacteremia in people 65-79 years is about 19.5/100,000. Among people older than 80 years th e incidence is 37.4/100,000. The mortality from invasive infections among people aged 65 and older is 30- 50% (Van Furth, 2000). 4.7.2 Description of the intervention and the current situation in the Netherlands Pneumococcal diseases can be treated with antibiotics. For prevention, two types of pneumococcal vaccines are now licensed in Eu rope, and include a variable number of capsular serotypes (bacteria that are sensitive to the vaccine ): the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PCV)1. PPV provides protection against invasive pneumococcal disease caused by 23 serotypes in subjects older than two years. PCV protects against seven serotypes, but provides also long lasting immunity against invasive dis ease in those younger than two years. In the Netherlands, in contrast to many EU -countries, vaccination against pneumococcal disease for elderly people is not routine. Among adults and elderly, the vaccine is administered only to individuals who are at substantially increased risk of pneumococcal infection, like people with immune system im pairment and splenectomy patients (Dutch Health Council, 2003). Since April 2006, vaccination with the conjugated 7-valent pneumococcal vaccine is included into the Na tional Immunization Programme. This vaccine has proven to be very effective against invasi ve pneumococcal disease in children (Black et al., 2000). Moreover, the vaccine has reduced ca rriage of pneumococci resulting in reduced transmission to the elderly, i.e. he rd immunity (Lexau et al., 2005). 4.7.3 Results from economic evaluations Nine economic evaluation studies on elderly vaccination with the 23 -valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine are examined in this re port (Appendix 7, Table 7.6). Two of these are carried out in the Netherlands (Baltussen et al., 1997; Postma et al., 2001). The cost- effectiveness ratios in the different studies vary from cost-saving to 24,872 ECU per QALY. The assumed effectiveness of the polysaccharid e vaccine against invasive disease in the elderly is important for the benefits of immuni zation. Studies vary in their assumptions on the efficacy of the vaccine, ranging from 55% for 5 years (all people 65 years) to 70-90% for five years (people aged 65-69 years). One st udy estimated the threshold of the vaccine's effectiveness at which vaccination would be co st-neutral, besides the costs per life year 1 See De Melker HE, Gerritsen AAM, Hahn\u00e9 SJM (Eds.) for further discussion on this subject. page 72 of 163 RIVM report 270091004 gained (Mangtani et al., 2005). None of the studies have used empirical data about the effectiveness of the vaccine in their modelling approach. Mo st economic evaluations have chosen to rely on efficacy data from observational studies ra ther than trials. However, in sensitivity analyses it turned out that vaccine effectiveness was the most influential variable. Some studies gave specific outcomes for age- groups and high-risk groups. Baltussen et al. (1997) concluded that cost-effec tiveness rates improve with highe r age of the target group for vaccination. Most (more recent) studies (Sisk et al., 1997; De Graeve et al., 2000b; Postma et and Edmunds, 2004) applied lower vaccine efficacies for older age groups. This had consequences for the relationship between age and cost-effectiveness of vaccinatio n. For instance, Sisk et al. (1997) found that cost-effectiveness ratios improved with increasing age until the age of 75 and above that age the ratio declined with increasing age. Studies differ with respect to the kind and leve l of costs that are incorporated. For example, the study of Silk et al. (1997) in cluded also costs that occur in years of life that would not were lived without the interv ention. Also, the vacci nation costs vary between studies. Four economic evaluations calculated the cost -effectiveness of pneumococcal vaccination, assuming that the vaccine was offered alongsid e the influenza vaccine (Mukamel et al., 2001; al., 2002; Melegaro and Edmunds, 2 004; Mangtani et al., 2005). This assumption in fact reflects the Dutch situation best, b ecause influenza vaccination is particularly recommended for people aged 65 and older. Am azian et al. (2002) showed that the cost- effectiveness of pneumococcal vaccination is wors e when the vaccine is not given at the same time as vaccination against influenza. Studies from Mukamel et al. (2001), Melegaro and Edmunds (2004), and Mangtani et al. (2005) do not make this comparison, and therefore, diverge from to the other considered studies. Difference in results can be partially attri buted to the inclusion or non-inclusion of noninvasive infections. Some studi es assume that the vaccine al so has a protective effect on infections with a noninvasive course (Baltuss en et al., 1997; De Graev e et al., 2000a). Other studies analyzed the effects on invasive di sease separately (De Graeve et al., 2000b (only meningitis); Mangtani et al., 2005) or solely (S isk et al., 1997; Postma et al., 2001; Amazian 2001; Melegaro Edmunds, 2004). Ho wever, a protective effect on noninvasive infections is controversia l. Including a protectiv e effect on noninvasive infections overestimates the benefits of the vaccination. The studies in which this was done, resulted in cost-savings. These outcomes are hypothetical until it can be proved that (new) vaccines are effective against noninvasive diseases (Beutels and Postma, 2001). 4.7.4 Transferability foreign study results to the Dutch situation An important determinant of cost-effectiven ess of the pneumococcal vaccination is the assumed incidence of invasive diseases cau sed by pneumococci. Most studies assume a higher incidence than the incidence that is found in the Netherlands (19.5/100,000 for people 65-79 years). For that reason vaccination may wo rk out less favourable in terms of cost- effectiveness in the Netherlands. Four studies reflect the Dutc h situation by assuming that pneumococcal vaccination takes place alongside influenza vaccination. However, only the costs reductions are taken in consideration, leading to more favourable cost-effectiv eness outcomes. The conceivable interdependence between both, influenza vacc ination and pneumococcal vaccination, is not RIVM report 270091004 page 73 of 163 taken into account. Since it is not certain to what extent in fluenza vaccination reduces the number of invasive pneumococcal infections the effectiveness of pneumococcal vaccination is unknown. That is the reason why the Dutch Cochrane Centre and the National Health Council concluded that there is insufficient evidence for implementation of pneumococcal vaccination besides the influenza vaccination for people aged 65 and over (Dutch Health Council, 2003). It is known that vaccination in children dimi nishes the incidence of pneumococcal disease among the elderly ( herd immunity). Since 2006, infants in the Nether lands are vaccinated with the conjugated 7-valent pneumococcal v accine. One can expect that the burden of disease among the elderly caused by the seve n serotypes will decr ease following the introduction of infant vaccination. Therefore, the use of the polysaccharide vaccine among the elderly may become less cost-effective in the future. 4.7.5 Feasibility of implementation in the Netherlands The pneumococcal vaccine could be administered to the elderly at the same time as the influenza vaccine or during routine medical c onsultation. It should be considered before implementation whether vaccination against pne umococcal disease has an impact on the influenza vaccination coverage (Van den Bosc h, 2002). It is not known in how far the uptake of influenza vaccination will be influenced by an additional vaccination at the same time. 4.7.6 Summary A bacterial infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae causes noninvasive infections and invasive diseases such as meningitis, septicaemia and pneumonia, generally associated with bacteremia. The incidence of pneumococcus bacteremia is about 19.5/100,000 in people 65- 79 years and 37.4/100,000 in people older than 80 years. The cost-effectiveness ratios range from cost-saving to 24,900 ECU per QALY. Converting this to 2005 Euros will result in a range from cost-saving to \u20ac 31,000 per QALY. Ther e are several threats to the transferability of foreign study results to the Dutch situation: a lower incidence of invasive diseases caused by pneumococci and the feasible interdep endency between influenza vaccination and pneumococcal vaccination. Most likely, pneumococcal vaccination will be easily implementable in the Netherlands, because it can be given at the same time as influenza vaccination. However, it may be that vaccinati on against pneumococcal disease influences the influenza vaccination coverage degree.

Conclusion and discussion on part A of this report 5.1 Main findings from part A of this report This report is the third in a se ries of reports that aim to id entify cost-effective preventive interventions that have not yet been diffused into the Dutch health care system or into a public health setting. In this report, five new in terventions are presented and at the same time, updated information on cost-effectiveness and im plementation issues for six interventions that were described in less detail in one of our previous reports. For all 11 interventions, brief information on the magnitude and character of the health problem is presented, along with information on the intervention, its cost-effectivene ss, and issues related to the transferability of foreign study results to the Dutch situation. Be sides, attention is paid to possible future implementation of the intervention in the Neth erlands by describing th e pros and cons of implementation. For each intervention, the findi ngs with regard to cost-effectiveness, transferability issues and implementation issues are summarized using a two-star system, as described in chapter 2, sections 2.2.5 to 2.2.8. Ta ble 5.1 shows our main findings, using this two-star system with regard to the three ke y elements that determine whether a preventive intervention shows great promise or not.

Benefit to cost ratios < 1 are reported. Costs per case averted above the expected cost per case are reported. ** Strong evidence: three or more studies show cost-effectiveness, defined as: The range of possible values of the cost-effectiveness ratio (either from sensitivity analyses or uncertainty analyses) does not exceed \u20ac 20,000 per QALY/ LYG and/or a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve shows that the probability that the cost-effectiveness ratio remains below \u20ac 20,000 is high. b) For transferability the stars represent: * Major problems with transferability of foreign study results to the Dutch situation, more res earch in the Dutch context is necessary. ** Results of foreign studies can easily be transferred to the Dutch situation. c) With respect to implementation issues the stars represent: * some or major problems were expected with regard to organizational / infrastructural issues and/or ethical concerns. ** it is anticipated that implementation of the intervention in the Netherlands is feasible, im plying no major problems with regard to organizational / infrastructur al issues and/or ethical concerns. Table 5.1, summarizes our main findings on cost-effectiveness, transferability of foreign study results to our country and implementation issues for 11 preventive interventions. An 'ideal' intervention should have two stars for al l three relevant aspects. No single intervention was given two stars for all three relevant aspects. Three interv entions were found to be very cost-effective and at the same time, no major barriers for implementation were found. These are screening for neonatal group beta streptoc occus infections, infl uenza vaccination of healthy working adults and stop smoking inte rventions in a GP practice. Three more interventions were found to be very cost-effect ive, but here, barriers towards implementation were found. These interventions are folic acid fo rtification of staple foods, water fluoridation to prevent dental decay and vaccination agai nst varicella zoster. For two interventions, implementation was described to be feasible , while some questions surrounding the cost- effectiveness of the intervention in the Dutch situation still remain. These are pneumococcal vaccination of elderly persons and pertussis vaccination of adolescents. With regard to transferability of foreign study re sults to the Dutch s ituation, it is concluded that almost all interventions need adaptation of foreign results to the specific Dutch context. 5.2 Discussion of results This report is the third report in which is fo cused on preventive interventions that may be promising. The first report, however, was an expl orative study and the criteria used for cost- effectiveness were different from ones used in the second and third report. The first report did not use the criterion that at least three good economic evaluations had to be available and it also included interventions that were already implemented in the Netherlands. Furthermore, the cut-off point of \u20ac 2500 per QALY was used. Th e aim of that first report was merely to demonstrate that many (existing) preventive in terventions are very cost-effective or even cost-saving. The aim of the latt er two reports was more to identify promising preventive interventions, which might be interesting to introduce in the Netherlands. Because methods used for the three reports were not uniform, all interventions of the first report were re- investigated, using the same criteria that were us ed in the second report. The results of this re- investigation are described in the current, th ird report. In this chapter our findings are discussed, as well as th e limitations of our study. RIVM report 270091004 page 77 of 163 Updating interventions from the 2003 report As can be seen in Table 5.1, several promisi ng interventions were id entified or updated in this report. The 11 interventions in this ta ble were all assessed using similar methodology. This implies that the interven tions identified in th e 2003 report were re-assessed using more strict inclusion criter ia in comparison with the ones used for the 2003 report. From the 18 interventions that were identified in the 2003 re port, 8 were implemented in the Netherlands or will be implemented in the near future. This left 10 interventions for the update using the current, more restricted, criteria. Unfortunatel y, the update resulted in an exclusion of 4 interventions that were identified before. Seve ral reasons contributed to the current decision to exclude interventions. These could either be related to the fact that three good quality studies showing cost-effectivenes s could not be identified, as was the case for the reduction of fat consumption to reduce heart disease and va scular diseases and in terventions to promote breastfeeding, or to the fact that the interventi on itself showed a large diversity in the way it was operationalized, as was the case with interven tions to prevent falls of elderly people and with hepatitis A vaccination of certain gr oups of employees. Details on the reason why interventions from the 2003 report were excl uded in the current report can be found in Appendix 2. The use of a two-star system for cost-effect iveness, transferability and implementation issues In the previous report (Vijgen et al., 2005), a two-star system to indicate the level of cost- effectiveness of preventive inte rventions was used for the first time. In comparison with the 2005 report, more attention was paid to tran sferability of forei gn study results and to implementation issues. In the current report, th e two-star system was extended to these other relevant issues. As appears from our results (s ummarized in Table 5.1), th e two-star system is hardly distinguishing the preventive interventions with regard to the i ssue of transferability. The conclusion can easily be drawn that forei gn study results can hardly ever be directly translated to the Dutch context. This implies that decision makers can not rely solely on results of foreign cost-effectiveness studies , when considering the implementation of a preventive intervention in the Netherlands. It will always be necessary to pay attention to cost-effectiveness in the Dutch context, either with a full Dutch cost-effectiveness study or with a careful assessment whether the foreign results will be more or less positive in the Netherlands. Only in a situation where it is estimat ed that all relevant factors (as appears from sensitivity analyses) are more positive for the Netherlands, and thus are affecting cost- effectiveness in a sense that the ratio decrease s, a decision maker can rely on foreign results. Such a situation will be very rare. In contrast to the former report, implementati on issues have now also been evaluated with a two-star system, giving a relatively equal wei ght to cost-effectiveness and feasibility of implementation. This reflects the actual situatio n in decision making, since it is impossible to implement even the most cost-effective or co st-saving intervention when major resistance within society is present or when financial, organizational or infrastructural issues make implementation impossible. However, in contrast to the evaluation of cost-effectiveness, the evaluation of the feasibility of implementation is done in a more qualitative way, as it is based on interviews with Dutch experts in the field of these preventive interventions. By using a two star system for both cost-effec tiveness and implementation, a relatively heavy weight is given to the qualitative assessment of feasibility of implementation, and thus to the vision of the experts that were interviewed. Th e assessment of feasibility of implementation could be given more weight using instrument s such as a consensus meeting where every possible stakeholder is invited to reflect upon th e issue. Such consensus meetings were used page 78 of 163 RIVM report 270091004 before, i.e. a consensus meeting on the necessity to start a national screening programme for colon cancer that was organized by ZonMw, and could be used again in the future, should decisions to start with the implementation of major preventive programmes have to be taken. However, in the context of this report series, su ch methods are hardly ap plicable. A first step to a more objective method for the appraisal of feasibility of implementation is to develop a checklist with all the relevant topics that mi ght play a part. This should be done in close cooperation with ZonMw, the Netherlands Organisation for Health Research and Development. Future reports within this proj ect should make use of such an implementation checklist. Information on cost-effec tiveness is only one asp ect of decision making The information presented in the report cont ributes to the assessment of the preventive intervention. It is meant to support future decision making on the implementation of the interventions. However, such decision making is not only based on the cost-effectiveness but also on other aspects. These aspects incl ude, among others, total budget impact of the intervention (what is the magnit ude of the group at which the in tervention is targeted, hence what will be the total budget impact of intr oduction of the new preventive intervention?), equity considerations (does the intervention contribute to the decrease of socioeconomic disparities in health?) and di sease impact, both at the national level (what is the total DALY loss associated with the disease?) and at indivi dual level (what is the impact of the health problem on the individual and his/her family?) (De Wit and Schuit, 2006). Hence, cost- effectiveness is only one element in the decisi on making process, but not an unimportant one. Especially with respect to the implementa tion of large screening programmes and the introduction of new vaccines in the Nationa l Immunization Programme, cost-effectiveness traditionally plays a large role. Only information on cost-effectiven ess, not on cost -ineffectiveness A consequence of the chosen methods is that only interventions were listed that have at least three good quality economic evaluations showing cost-effectiveness (defined as cost per QALY of maximal \u20ac 20,000). Although this is info rmative with regard to future decision making on the nationwide implementation of one or more of these interv entions, this focus on cost-effective interventions results in more or less ignoring the knowledge of which interventions are less cost-effec tive or even cost-ineffective. Such knowledge could also be informative for health policy makers, either because it makes clear that some interventions should not be introduced or that existing inte rventions should become redundant. However, it should be noted that publication bias might hamper the attemp t to identify cost-ineffective interventions, as it is usually more di fficult to publish negative study results. An example of a study that presents informa tion on both cost-effective and cost-ineffective interventions is recently published by Maciosek et al. (2006). They conc entrated on clinical preventive services and prioritized all availa ble information by awarding maximal five points to the level of cost-effectiven ess (using 1 point for interventi ons with a cost-effectiveness ratio US $ 165,000 / QALY and 5 points for interventi ons that are cost-saving) and also by awarding maximal 5 points to the clinical ly preventable burden, ranging from < 15,000 QALYs (1 point awarded) to 360,000 QALYs (5 points awar ded). Here, priorities for further introduction of preventive interventi ons were established by comparing the total ranking (maximum total score of 10 points) with what is known about the current rates of use of these clinical preventive serv ices (estimated as a percentage of what is being considered as the optimal use of the preventive intervention). On e difference in the focus of Maciosek et al. (2006) and the current focus is of course th at they focus on existi ng clinical preventive RIVM report 270091004 page 79 of 163 services, and that we try to identify new and in teresting interventions fr om the whole field of prevention, including health promotion, health pr otection and health in all policy. However, in future research, we could extend the a ssessment method that currently consists of information with regard to cost-effectiveness, transferability and impl ementation, to a system that also includes quantitative information on the preventable disease burden. Then, it should also be explored whether othe r important characteris tics of prevention, su ch as total budget impact and equity aspects could be introdu ced in our assessment method. One additional advantage of such an extended assessment method is that it will be easier to link information from the work to the priorities for preventi on, as communicated by the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sportsin the recently this G overnment White Paper, five priorities for prevention were launched, namely smoking, problem atic alcohol use, depression, overweight (physical activity and nutrition) and diabetes mellitus. At present, none of the five new interventions as described in th is report are related to these priorities. Coincidentally, all newly identified interventions are related to infectious diseases. From the interventions that were described in earlier reports (see Table 1.1.), only seven inte rventions are targeted at one of the five national prevention priorities. Therefor e, concluded is that there is an urgent need for more effectiveness and cost-effectiveness studies of interventions that address the health problem areas as defined in the Tweede Preventienota. Prioritising cost-eff ective interventions It may be worthwhile to build upon the inform ation described in the three RIVM reports (Dirkmaat et al., 2003; Vijgen et al., 2005; curr ent report) by prioriti zing the interventions with respect to importance of implementation in the Dutch healthcare or public health system. This could be done using a system such as pres ented in Maciosek et al. (2006) (described above) or with panel sessions, for instance pane ls of health care workers, citizens and/or healthcare policymakers. Such a prioritization exercise could become part of the next Volksgezondheids Toekomst Verkenning (Public Health Status and Forecast report) in 2010. However, in order to do so, a pr ioritization system should be deve loped in the next two years. This prioritization system could build on recent work performed in this field, for instance by the Raad voor de Volksgezondheid en Zorg (2 006) and on previous work by other authors, such as Stolk (2004). Foreign experiences with prioritization, for instance those of the US Committee on Clinical Preventive Service Priori ties (Coffield et al., 200 1; Maciosek et al., 2006), could also be taken into account. A prerequisite for prio ritization different interventions is that comparable outcome meas ures (costs per (qual ity adjusted) life year gained) are used. As can be seen from Tables 6.1 to 7.6, the included studies report various outcome measures. For instance, when 'cas es prevented' refer to young persons this represents much more QALYs gained as co mpared to older persons. This makes cost- effectiveness ratios based on these different outcome measures incomparable among each other. So for a prioritization exercise only those studies that report costs per QALY can be included. Early warning system Starting with the 2005 report, strict conditions are used for evidence. Only those interventions with at least three good-quality studies that describe cost-effectiveness were included. Only those interventions for which all available studies report cost-effectiveness ratios under \u20ac 20,000 per QALY are rewarded with the maximum score of two stars for cost- effectiveness. As a result of th e use of this strict selection cr iterion, it is increasingly difficult to describe really new cost-effective prev entive interventions, simply because new interventions have not been rigo rously tested for their cost-eff ectiveness. Of course, that does page 80 of 163 RIVM report 270091004 not imply that these interventions are not promising or that they are not cost-effective. It might be interesting to extend the current research and add a separate section on early warning in the future reports. This could be based on effectiveness studies with limited information on cost-effectivity and/or on ow n modelling work to explore the cost- effectiveness of interventions in a more crude way. Such an early warning system may be input for research programming by e.g. ZonMw, the Netherlands Organisation for Health Research and Development. ZonMw could use information from such an early warning system to specifically call for research propos als investigating the cost-effectiveness of selected intervention(s) in the Dutch context. Furthermore, the link to the modelling part of the project (part B of this report) could also be improved by exploring th e costs and effects of future implementation of interventions with limited evidence on cost-effectiveness, using a modelling exercise. Such early modelling can iden tify the key data that need to be available for a more final cost-effectiveness analysis, and will inform research programmers and policy makers which information is still needed be fore a well-informed decision on implementation of the intervention can be made. Use of strict criteria to assess whether new interventions are promising has disadvantages too As discussed above, the methods and criteria to select interventions and characterize them as promising for public health policy have some disadvantages too. One major disadvantage is that we were asked by the Ministry of Healt h, Welfare and Sports to only select those interventions with health effects within the next five years. Many interventions, for instance interventions to promote the intake of healt hy food, have effects in the longer term only. However, interventions that are effective in th e long term may still be cost-effective, and as such promising for public health policy. The in clusion of a longer time horizon in future research is strongly supported. Also, the strict criteria for inclusion of interventions, main ly the criterion that three good quality studies have to be avai lable, prevent the identification of preventive interventions that differ slightly in the way they are executed in previous cost-effectiveness research. For instance, several good quality economic evaluati ons were found evaluating the prevention of accidental falls in elderly persons, but the inte rventions itself were not always comparable. For instance, some publications described a home hazard reduction programme while other publication evaluated such a home hazard reduc tion programme with medication adjustments and targeted exercise progra mmes. Another example is the vaccination against hepatitis A virus for selected groups of employees. Public ations describing the cost-effectiveness of vaccination of military staff, traveling freque ntly to endemic regions, for vaccination of people working in nurseries and other employ ees working with young children, and for food industry workers were found. It is possible th at these types of in terventions might be interesting within the Du tch public health context, but the so le argument that less than three good quality economic evaluations are available ha mpers the inclusion of this intervention in the report. An early warning system, as de scribed above, could provided with room to describe interventions that are possibly intere sting within the Dutch context, but for which three or more high quality economic ev aluations are not yet available. One further disadvantage the methodology used is that for some preventive interventions one can only discuss one preventive strategy, namely th e one that was evaluate d in at least three studies of good quality, while mo re strategies are available. Sometimes, it would be more interesting to discuss all prevention options fo r one health problem in a more integral way. One example is the prevention of hepatitis B. In this report, st udies were discussed evaluating RIVM report 270091004 page 81 of 163 the universal vaccination of infants. In a low en demic country such as the Netherlands, this is just one option for prevention policy. Other options include the vaccination of risk groups, adolescents, certain groups of immigrants, and certain groups of employees. Such a more integral approach towards all prevention polic ies that are available is only possible in a situation where the criterion that at least three good quality studies have to be available is relieved a bit. Possibly, this could also fall w ithin the outline of an ear ly warning system, as proposed above. Cost-effectiveness primarily known in the area of disease prevention As in previous reports, the conclusion is made that disease prevention is the area that was evaluated best with regard to its cost-effectivenes s. Out of the eleven interventions described in detail in this report, eight interventions are from the disease prevention area, two from the health protection area (fluorida tion of drinking water and folic acid fortification of flour) and one stems from the health promotion area (stop smoking interventions). No single interventions were identified from the health in all policy area, as in previous years. In their review of the cost-effectiveness of preventive po licies, Goldsmith et al. (2004) found that health in all policy interventions do not always incorporate health outcomes in their eval uations. By definition, these interventions have multiple health and so cial outcomes that sometimes are difficult to quantify. However, a major requirement for adding a sound economic evaluation to these interventions is not fulfilled if health effect s are not measured. Several authors have also described the difficulties in properly determ ining the (cost-))effectiveness of community prevention programmes (Carande-Kulis et al ., 2000; Thomson et al., 2004; De Wit and Brouwer, 2004). Insufficient funding for evaluating health promo tion interventions, especially in comparison with pharmaceuticals and medical technology, further disadvantages the growth of the economic knowledge on prevention. However, unlike the situation with large screening or vaccination programmes, economic evaluation ha s so far not played a well-defined role in decision making around health promotion activities, health protection measur es or health in all policies. In a situation where economic eval uation becomes a mandatory element in the decision making process, public health funding w ould severely be discri minated in comparison with the disease prevention field, simply because not everything that counts can be counted and not everything that can be counted counts. Vaccinations Four out of five interventions that are describe d for the first time in the current report are new vaccines for infectious diseases. Indeed, many new vaccines are being developed, tested and marketed at present (De Melker et al., 2005) . A decision to implement new vaccines in the National Immunization Programme is a complicated one. Besides the cons iderations that are key in any implementation decision on preven tive interventions, such as budgetary consequences and disease impact, some very specific questions have to be answered satisfactorily before new vaccines can be intr oduced in the Netherlands. Among these issues are vaccine safety, both of stand-alone vacci nes and of combinati on vaccines, the total number of vaccinations that is acceptable for children and their parents, the consequences of more vaccinations on vaccine compliance and ther efore, on the level of herd immunity. The Centre for Infectious Diseases Control of th e RIVM publishes an annual report on the status quo of candidate vaccines for the National Immu nization Programme. In this report, factual information on all relevant other aspects of v accine introduction, besides cost-effectiveness, is given. It is clear that not all vaccine candidates can be intr oduced at the same time. This would not only require large investments, but probably also be not acceptable for both parents and health care workers involved in the National Immunization Programme. However, two of the vaccines described in this report are vaccines that (also) protect against page 82 of 163 RIVM report 270091004 sexually transmitted diseases. These vaccines may also be given at a later age than early childhood, for instance during adolescence. This opens the discussion whether adolescent vaccination should be introduced in the Nether lands. A Health Council committee advises the ministry on the future content of our Nationa l Immunization Programme. The next advice is due in December 2006. It is anticipated that the Health Council committee will include considerations on all four vaccines described in the current report in his advice, and also that the committee reflects upon the introduction of adol escent vaccination in the Netherlands. Use of different perspectives It is difficult to compare the results of different economic evaluations, even for one preventive intervention. One majo r reason for these difficulties is that studies use different perspectives. Study outcomes in terms of cost -effectiveness ratio may differ largely when different perspectives are used (Feenstra et al., 2006; Drumm ond et al., 2005). Often, interventions are cost-saving or very cost-eff ective from a societal perspective but less efficient from a payer perspective. Therefore, one should always note from which perspective a study was done. One apparent example is vari cella vaccination. Here, the programme costs are most likely born by society (via the Mi nistry of Health's budget for the National Immunization Programme), while the principal beneficiary of the positive economic effects are employers, because it is less likely that pa rents have to stay at home with their sick children. From the payer's perspective, the investment in varicella vaccination may still be interesting, but primarily for ot her reasons than economic reas ons, since the investment will not pay back via reduced treatm ent costs. However, in circumstances were prevention still requires a net payment from the payers' perspect ive, the issue of opportunity cost becomes a prominent one. This implies that the investment in one activity is associated with the need to forego another activity. As the total prevention budget is limited by definition, investments in efficient preventive programmes sometimes cannot be made. 5.3 Directions for further research Following from the remarks that were made in the previous section, conclusions are made for this part of the report by summarizing some directions for future research. We will distinguish between directions fo r the own future research and directions for future research in general. Directions for future RIVM research: The 21 preventive interventions that were identified in the three successive RIVM reports should all be assessed using sim ilar methodology (i.e. methodology as used in the current report). As the current report contains an update of the interventions described first in the 2003 repor t, the practical implication of this remark is that the ten different preventive interventions that were introduced in the 2005 report (Vijgen et al., 2005) should explicitly be assessed w ith regard to transferability of foreign study results to the Dutch c ontext and with regard to implementation aspects. The assessment method currently used in our reports (focusing on cost-effectiveness, transferability of forei gn study results, and implemen tation aspects) should be extended with quantified information on the preventable disease burden. Furthermore, it should be explored whethe r other important aspects of prevention, such as total budget impact and individual burden of dis ease (e.g. disability weights), can be introduced in the a ssessment method. RIVM report 270091004 page 83 of 163 All available information for 21 (or possibly more in the years to come) preventive interventions should be prioritized. This c ould be done in the context of the next Public Health Status and Forecast report th at is scheduled for 2010. In the next two years, a prioritization system should be developed further. The work for this report series could be extended with an early warning section, in which promising effective interventions are identified. If economic information is not yet available but interventions otherwis e appear to be implementable in the Netherlands, ZonMw could specifically invite the research community to submit targeted research proposals. This will e nhance the link between the work as being done in the context of these report series and research programming by ZonMw. Also, preliminary modelling of cost-effectivene ss of implementation in the Netherlands could point out which parameters need to be further explored in a Dutch context. The time horizon for effectiveness of interventions to be selected, which is currently set at the next five years, should be ex tended to a longer time horizon, for instance 20 to 50 years in the future. New interventions that appeared not to be cost-effective should also be listed in future reports. General directions for research on cost-effectivene ss of prevention: There is a need for systematic reviews of ef fectiveness of health promotion activities, health protection measures and healt hy public policy interv entions. For those interventions that appear to be effectiv e but for which economic evidence is lacking, economic evaluations should be performed. Here, again a link can be made between this work and research programming by ZonMw. Preventive activities that were implemente d long ago should be re-evaluated for their cost-effectiveness, regarding changes in th e health care and public health context since its introduction. There is an urgent need for more effec tiveness and cost-effectiveness studies of interventions that address the five majo r health problems in the Netherlands, as defined in a recent Government White Paper on Prevention (Tweede Preventienota). The study found that foreign studies are ne ver easily transferab le to the Dutch situation. For the major factors that dete rmine the cost-effectiveness of a specific intervention (as determined by sensitivity analyses / uncertainty analyses), it will always be necessary to look at the Dutc h situation. Hence, decision makers should never rely on foreign cost-effectiveness analyses alone when a decision on implementation of new preventive interventions has to be made. page 84 of 163 RIVM report 270091004 RIVM report 270091004 page 85 of 163 Part B: Modelling effects of nationwide implementation of new preventive interventions page 86 of 163 RIVM report 270091004 RIVM report 270091004 page 87 of 163 6. Introduction 6.1 Outline part B In the previous report on economic evaluations of preventive interventions, several cost- effective interventions that were not systema tically implemented in the Netherlands were identified (Vijgen et al., 2005). Many of these interventions only had evidence from international cost-effectiveness analyses . To estimate the cost-effectiveness of implementation of these preventive interv entions in the Nether lands, two of these interventions were selected for further anal ysis: the prevention of recurrent depression by maintenance cognitive behavioural therapy, a nd the prevention of ch ronic diseases by pharmacologic treatment of obesity. These inte rventions were assumed not to have major barriers for implementation, and their cost-eff ectiveness has not yet been modelled in the Netherlands. Chapter 7 presents the mode lling study on the costs and effects of the prevention of recurrent depression by mainte nance cognitive behavi oural therapy. Then, chapter 8 contains the modelli ng study on the costs and effects of the prevention of chronic diseases by pharmacologic treatment of obesit y. This is followed by a general discussion (chapter 9). Before proceedi ng, the general methodology is desc ribed and it is elaborated on how the results should be interpreted. 6.2 Methodology and the role of uncertainty A crucial element of all economic evaluations is the perspective that is taken in the analyses. The perspective of an economic evaluation determ ines what costs and effects are taken into account (Brouwer and Koopmanschap, 2000). For in stance, if the persp ective of a study is that of the patient, only costs that are relevant for the patient, like travel costs, are taken into account while costs of medical treatment are i gnored (assuming the patient does not have to pay for these costs). The two cost-effectivene ss studies presented in this part were both evaluated from a health care perspective. This means that all differences in medical costs over the modelled time horizon were taken into account, and that is was assumed that the interventions, if implemented, would be paid for by parties belonging to the health care system. Taking into account di fferences in lifetime health care costs means that if the intervention extends life, also so-called medical costs in life years gained are taken into account (Van Baal et al., 2006b). In accordan ce with the guidelines for pharmacoeconomic research, effects and costs were discount ed at 1.5% and 4.0% a nnually (Rodenburg - Van Dieten, 2005). To estimate effects of new preventive interv entions, models are needed that combine information from many different data sources (Griffin et al., 2006; Sc ulpher et al., 2006). Since in most cases a lot of parameters (i.e. the effects of treatmen ts) are not well-known, uncertainty of those parameters influences th e outcome of the study. To reflect uncertainty in model parameters on outcomes, we have employed probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA). In this analysis, uncertainties are defi ned for the input data in the model. One then randomly draws new input data from the uncerta inty distribution, and feeds this into the method, yielding a new result. This process is repeated e.g. 1000 times, and the variability page 88 of 163 RIVM report 270091004 of the 1000 results from this process reflect s the uncertainty about the outcome of the method. In a cost-effectiveness analysis, outcome s are incremental cost s and effects of an intervention. Figure 6.1 displays the outcomes of a PSA in a so-called cost-effectiveness plane of a hypothetical inte rvention 0.04 0.06 0.14QALYs25050075010001250150017502000Costs in \u20ac Intervention A Figure 6.1: Example of a cost-effectiveness plane By dividing the mean incremental costs (the numerator) by the mean incremental QALYs (the denominator) an incremental cost-effectiven ess ratio (ICER) is obtained. In the example of Figure 6.1 the ICER equals \u20ac 15,000 per QALY gained. Another way to present uncertainty around the IC ER is through the use of a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve (CEAC) (Fenwick et al., 2001). In a CEAC, the probability that an intervention is most cost-effective compared to its comparators is displayed as a function of the monetary value attached to a QALY (also ca lled the threshold). By attaching monetary values to a QALY one can calcu late the net monetary benef it on an intervention. If for instance a QALY is valued \u20ac 10,000 the net monetary benefit can be calculated by multiplying the QALYs gained with \u20ac10,000 and th en substract the incremental health care costs. The CEAC can be plotted by calculating th e net monetary benefit for different values of the threshold for all values of the outcomes of the PSA for all possible interventions. Figure 6.2 displays a CEAC for the hypothe tical intervention A compared to usual care. What can be derived from Figure 6.2 is that the probability of intervention A to be cost-effective increases as the threshold increases. Vice versa, the probability that usual care is cost-effective decreases as the threshold in creases. Given a threshold of \u20ac 20,000 intervention A has the highest probability of being cost-effective. However, should the threshold value be \u20ac 10.000 per QALY, it is more likely that usual care is most cost-effective. It shou ld be noted that the intervention with the lowest ICER does not nece ssarily have the highest probability of being cost-effective, because the leve l of uncertainty about the ICER is taken into account in the cost-effectiveness acceptability curve. Furtherm ore, two interventions with the same ICER can have different probabilities to be cost-effective because of differences in the distribution of costs and effects for different values of the input parameters. This is one of the reasons one should not base decisions solely on cost-effec tiveness acceptability frontiers. Mean ICERs and CEACs are different ways of looking at a decision problem that is surrounded with uncertainty and offer compleme ntary information (Claxton, 1999). RIVM report 270091004 cost-effectiveness acceptability curve The incorporation of uncertainty into cost-effectiveness analysis is not merely an academic exercise. The issue of uncertainty is closely related to real life decision making in the field of health care (Claxton et al., 2005). There is no such thing as making decisions without uncertainty since we never know for sure what future outcomes of current health policy will be. However, decisions inevitably have to be made under uncertainty and continuing with usual care is just as well a decision as deciding to change usual care. Therefore, the choice was made to explicitly incorporate uncertainty for some model input parameters in the presentation of the results in this part of the report. This is done as a first step in incorporating uncertainty in the presentation of results of economic evaluations performed at the RIVM. page 90 of 163 RIVM report 270091004 RIVM report 270091004 page 91 of 163 7. The prevention of recurrent depression by maintenance cognitive behavioural therapy 7.1 Description of health problem and the intervention In the Netherlands, the twelvemonth preval ence of major depression is estimated at 737,000 (i.e. 5.4% of those above 12 years of ag e). Depression is less prevalent in adolescents (3.8%), and elderly pe ople (5.0%), as compared to adults between 18 and 65 years of age (5.7%). Each year almost 300,000 adults develop a major depression for the first time (De Hollander et al., 2006). Depres sion ranks fourth in the burden of disease list in the Netherlands (De Holla nder et al., 2006) and the preval ence of depression is twice as high in women as in men. In 2003, the cost s of care for depressi on (including the costs for dysthymia) were \u20ac 660 m illion (Slobbe et al., 2006). The mean duration of an episode of depression is 6 months, the two-year ri sk of recurrence is 40%, and the lifetime risk of recurrence is ev en 70-80% (Meijer et al ., 2006). These figures explain why depression is by a growing amount of experts considered as a chronic disease rather than an episodic diseas e currently. So, the treatment of depression should not only be aimed at the treatment of the specific episode , but also at the prevention of recurrences (Gilbody et al., 2006). This is why more and more long-term maintenance treatments are advocated. In this section the cost-effectiv eness of maintenance Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (mCBT) is estimated. The calculations were based on a study by Vos and colleagues who evaluated the costs and effects of several treatment strategies for major depression (Vos et al., 2005). A 5-year maintenance treatment with CBT came to the fore as most cost- effective (varying from cost-saving to Aus$ 3,000/QALY). CBT is a psychological treatment process that help s patients to correct false self beliefs that lead to depressed mood and behaviour (Rupke et al., 2006). CBT usually consists of several sessions with a therapist, either in groups or individually. The maintenance variant of CBT includes regularly (once or twi ce a year) booster sessions with the therapist for a period of five years. The setting in which the costs and effects of mCBT were calculated is the Dutch general practitioner. The costs and eff ects of mCBT are compared to the costs and effects of usual care in this setting. The twelvemonth preval ence for depression diagnosed by the general practitioner is 363,000 (Westert et al., 2006). This is only half of the total prevalence in the Netherlands. Of the patients who are diagnosed by their GP as suffering from a major depression, 78,4% receive antidepre ssants, only 2,2% are referred to mental health care and 20% neither receives antidepressants nor is referred to mental health . (Westert et al., 2006). page 92 of 163 RIVM report 270091004 7.2 Methodology Major depression is a disease that is characte rised by episodes with depressive symptoms and periods without depressive symptoms. Once in a depressed episode, the probability to recover declines as the length of the episode increases . Vice versa: once recove red, probabilities to relapse decrease as time elapse s. Therefore, a Markov model was developed distinguishing depressed and non-depressed states in which r ecovery and relapse prob abilities are dependent on the time spent in a state (see Figure 7.1). Figure 7.1: Schematic representation of the Markov model of depression The Markov model allows simulating a cohort of people diagnosed with depression over time in cycles of four weeks. Thus, in every cy cle a person with depressive symptoms has a probability to either recover or to remain depressed. Transition probabilities of the model were taken from the relapse and recovery curves presented by Vos et al., (Vos et al., 2004) and are displayed in Appendix 8. Since we had no empirical data on the initial distribution of all people diagnosed with depression by the GP over all model states, we generated this distribution by running the model for a cohort of persons just recovered from an episode (all persons have 0 - 3 weeks no depressive symptoms at baseline) for 30 years. After 30 years the distribution is in a so-called steady state which means that given th e input parameters the distribution over the model states is stable. Since this steady st ate distribution is independent of the initial distribution over the model states we used this as our ba seline distribution. The initial distribution over all possible states is displayed in Appendix 8. The usual care scenario is determined by us ing the Second National Study of Dutch general practitioner (Westert et al., 2006). Patients diag nosed with a major depression contact their GP on average 4 times a year for depression. Of those contacts, 66.4% are consultations, 4.4% are visits by the GP and 29% are tele phone contacts. The mean duration of a GP consultation is 15 minutes (Westert et al., 2006 ). On average 78.4% of the patients receive antidepressants. On average 2.2% of the patients are referred to mental health care, such as RIAGG, psychiatrists a nd psychologists. Because of this small 0-1 month depressive symptoms 1-2 month depressive symptoms 2-3 month depressive symptoms 3-4 month depressive symptoms > 1 year depressive symptoms 0-1 month no symptoms 1-2 month no symptoms 2-3 month no symptoms 3-4 month no symptoms > 2 years no ymptoms Relapse Recovery RIVM report 270091004 page 93 of 163 percentage and the diversity in intensity of mental health car e this subpopulation receives, we left this out of our calculation. Table 7.1 displays estimated costs for usual care and the mCBT maintenance intervention . These costs were calculated by using a bottom- up method; first the intervention was outlined in detail to estimate the exp ecte resource use and secondly, this resource use was multiplied by standardized unit costs (O ostenbrink et al., 2000). Table 7.1: Intervention costs per patient for mCBT and usual care (undiscounted, 2005 euros) Scenario Period and type of costs Units Unit price Costs mCBT Total costs year 1 10 2,07 20,70 6*60 1,12 403,20 GP time Psychologist time Manual 1 12,85 12,85 Total costs per year years 2, 3, 4 and 5 Psychologist time minimum maximum 1*60 2*60 1,12 67 134 Usual care Medication Specific serotonine reuptake (SSRI) 4b other antidepressants, No6AX Venlafaxine13% 22 (10 9 benzodiazepines anxiolytica, No5BA Oxazepam 12% 8 benzodiapines sedative, No5CD Temazepam5% 9 (15 tablets of 20mg) 1 Other costs per year GP time 3*15 2,07 93,15 GP time 1*5 2,07 0,04 Telephone costs 5 0,03 0,15 a Calculated as 14 euro * 2 (for 30 days) * 1 (for 20 mg) * 59% b Calculated as 8 euro * 2 (for 30 days) * 2 (for 150 mg) * 13% In the cost calculation of mCBT, it was assume d that all sessions were individual sessions provided by a psychologist and that one manual was given to each patient. In the years thereafter, individual sessions were provided by a psychologist as well. In the usual care scenario, antidepressants were included. The me dication costs per patient were taken from a medication website from the Dutch Organisation for Health Care Financing (CVZ, 2006). For the calculation per type of antidepressive medication, the medicine was taken that was prescribed most in the GIP database (GIP, 2003). The GIP database is a database in which the page 94 of 163 RIVM report 270091004 medication use of the Dutch population can be found. Assumed are average dosages of 150 mg for TCA, 20 mg for SSRIs and 150 mg for ot her antidepressants. B ecause not all the GP contacts under usual care are c onsultations, it is assumed that 66% of the 4 contacts were consultations (is 3) and 30% of the contacts were telephone contacts (is 1). As mentioned before the duration of a consultation was on av erage 15 minutes. Furthermore, an average duration of a telephone contact of 5 minutes is assumed. Costs and effects in terms of QALYs can be ca lculated with the model by coupling costs and disability weights to the states distinguished in the model. In the model it is assumed that quality of life equals 1 if not depressed and (1- 0.46) if depres sed but not treated (Kruijshaar et al., 2003). Treatment of majo r depression affects quality of life during an episode and the risk of relapse when recovered from the ep isode. To estimate effects of interventions, different scenarios are run with the model in which in the intervention scenario transition relapse probabilities are decrea sed and quality of life weights during depressive episodes are increased. Generally, effects of interventions are not measured in terms of quality of life but in terms of depression severity measured with depression specific scales . To translate effects on depression severity to effects on quality of life we followed the same approach as Vos and colleagues (Sanderson et al., 2004). They used a conversion factor to translate effects measured in standard deviations on depressive specific measurement scales to effects on disability weights which is derived using a gene ric quality of life profile. In the usual care scenario, it is assumed that there is a lag to treatment, before a patient with depressive symptoms contacts the GP and r eceives treatment. In the mCBT there is no lag to treatment since it is assumed that all persons start with mCBT immediately. Improvements in quality of life occur once one starts with treatment. Furt hermore, it is assumed that effects due to treatments only accrue to those who adhere to treatment. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) were expressed in euro per QALYs gained. To reflect the uncertainty inherent in the estim ation of most model parameters, probabilistic sensitivity analysis was carri ed out. Costs were discounted at 4.0% and effects at 1.5%, reflecting current Dutch standa rds. With PSA, uncertainty in the input parameters is addressed and reflected in the model output, th e ICER (see Section 6.2 for explanation). In Table 7.2, the distributions used in the PSA are displayed. ICERs were estimated for two different populations: a populati on just recovered from a depressive episode and a mixed population in which an initial distribution over al l model states is estimated (see Appendix 8). The latter population is a better reflection for the current population of people diagnosed with major depression in the GP, since some of them will be in a depressive episode for a while and some have been recovered. Table 7.2 summari zes the assumptions used to estimate the costs and effects of usual care and mCBT in the Dutch GP setting.

In the mixed population, th e health gains are somewhat lower and a patient on average gains 0.05 QALY over a period of 5 years at higher costs resulting in a mean ICER of \u20ac 15,000 per QALY ga ined. The health gains are lower than in a cohort of people just recovered from an episode since most health gains can be achieved after recovery due to improved risk of relapse.

If a threshold of page 98 of 163 RIVM report 270091004 \u20ac 20,000 per QALY is taken, mCBT has a high probability to be cost-effective, both in the mixed population and in the population just reco vered. However, as we will elaborate on in the discussion, not all uncertain ty is taken into account. 7.4 Conclusions on cost-effect iveness of intervention The modelling study showed that health gains can be achieved at a relatively low cost if the GP refers persons diagnosed with major depr ession to mCBT instead of prescribing anti- depressive medication. Both in a cohort of peopl e just recovered from a depressive episode and in a mixed population, the ICERs remain below the threshold of \u20ac 20,000 per QALY gained. This is mainly the result of a longer sustained period of risk reduction for recurrence. This conclusion should however be interpreted w ith caution, since a lot of parameters in the model are based on international studies wh ile some important model parameters, like adherence to treatments, should preferably be based on Dutch data. As in any modelling study, some simplifying assumptions were made. One of the most important assumptions was that there was no modeling of heterogeneity of patients. Of course, people diagnosed with depression differ in the severity of their depres sive symptoms and in their risk on recurrence and recovery. Furthermore, although we did ta ke into account uncertainty around a lot of model parameters, uncertainty around some cr ucial parameters could not be addressed. Additional uncertainty may influence both estima tes of the mean cost-effectiveness ratio and the decision uncertainty as displayed in th e cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. To minimize uncertainty, further research should be done on the following issues: - Uncertainty around relapse afte r recovery from a depressive episode and recovery once in a depressive episode; - Adherence to treatments within the Netherlands; - Estimation of intervention effects on quality of life. An additional important result is that mCBT treatment of the whole group of persons with major depression by the GP is probably less cost -effective than persons just recovered from an episode. The ratios are somewhat higher compared to the study by Vos and colleagues (Vos et al., 2005), which focused on persons just recovered from a depressive episode, even though costs were discounted at a higher rate and effects at a lo wer rate. This has to do with the fact that in the Dutch GP setting more pers ons already receive evidence-based treatments (about 80% receive antidepressants which also reduces symptoms and improves the relapse risk) than in the study by Vo s et al. (about 60%). Secondly, antidepressants are relatively cheaper in the Netherlands compared to the costs of cognitive behavioural therapy. Third, Vos et al. (2005) took into account the effects of tr eatments on the risk of suicide. Due to lack of data, effects of treatments on suicides were not taken into account. Of course, health gains would increase if mCBT decreases the risk of suicide. However, taking into account effects on suicide would imply a longer time horizon for the interventions and taking into account medical costs in life years gained. RIVM report 270091004 page 99 of 163 8. The prevention of chronic diseases by diet and pharmacologic treatment of obesity 8.1 Description of the health problem and the intervention In the Netherlands, one in every te n individuals is obese (i.e. BMI 30 kg/m2). Obesity entails an increased risk for type 2 diabetes, high bl ood pressure, high cholesterol, heart disease, cancer, musculoskeletal disorders, respirat ory problems, and psychosocial problems. Moderate overweight (25<BMI<30 kg/m2) and obesity yearly cause 40,000 cases of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and can cer, and circa 7% of all mortal ity. It is estimated that the health problems due to overweight cause a loss of 215.000 DALYs each year (De Hollander et al., 2006). Successful treatment of obesity (weight loss) will reduce the in creased risk for these chronic diseases, and will thus prevent much burden of disease. The treatment should be aimed at a modest weight loss (5-15%) whic h has to be sustained in the long term (Zelissen and Mathus- Vliegen, 2004). Such a modest, sustained weight loss reduces risk factors and morbidity in obese patients. Treatment opti ons include lifestyl e programmes (e.g. diet therapy, exercise programme, behavioural therapy) , pharmacological treatment, or surgery. Currently there are no guidelines for the treatment of obesity in the Netherlands. Interna tional guidelines state that the treatment of obesity should focu s on producing substantial weight loss over a prolonged period of time (NHLBI, 1998). This tr eatment should focus on altering dietary and physical activity patterns. As part of a comprehensive weight loss programme, pharmacological treatment is recommended for pa tients with obesity ( NHLBI, 1998). It is emphasized that weight loss drugs should neve r be used without concomitant lifestyle changes. The Dutch Health Council recommended an integrated approach, i.e. a combination of lifestyle programmes and pharmacologic tr eatment (Health Council of the Netherlands, 2003). The most frequently used weight loss drugs are Orlistat and Sibutramine. Many studies have shown that the pharmacologic treatment of obesity (i.e. drugs in combination with lifestyle changes) is effective in achieving a modest weight loss (Li et al ., 2005). Several economic evaluations reported that pharmaco logical treatment of obesity is cost-effective compared to lifestyle changes only (Vijgen et al., 2005) . This study aimed to estimate the cost- effectiveness of the prevention of chronic dis ease by pharmacological treatment of obesity in combination with a diet in the Netherlands. Co sts and effects of a di et only intervention and diet in combination with Orlista t for one year are compared to the cost and effects of no care. It was chosen to use no care as comparator since the Second National Study of Dutch general practitioner showed that primary care pa tients diagnosed with obesity receive pharmacological treatment in 22% of the cases, a nd 5% are referred to a dietician (Westert et al., 2006). All other patients receive no obesity tr eatment, or only informal lifestyle advice of low intensity. page 100 of 163 RIVM report 270091004 8.2 Methodology Orlistat in combination with a diet was compared to a diet alone and no care at all to compute incremental cost-effectiveness ra tios. The target population we re all Dutch people between 20 and 70 years with a BMI>30 that receive no care at all for their obesity (80% of the obese population). In the diet only intervention, ever ybody in the target population receives a low- calorie diet, while being counseled by a diet ician. In the diet + Orlistat intervention everybody receives pharmacologic treatment (Orlista t) in addition to a low-calorie diet and counselling by a dietician. Those who do not res pond to the treatment (i.e. those who lose <5% of their weight within the first three months) discontinue Orlistat treatment (circa 50%) (Li et al., 2005). Table 8.1 displays the intervention costs as ca lculated for the Orlistat intervention. These costs were calculated by usi ng a bottom-up method; first the intervention was outlined in detail to estimate the resource use and thereafter, this resource use was multiplied by standardized unit costs (Oostenbrink et al., 2000). In the cost calculation it was assumed that those who do not respond to the Orlistat trea tment (50%) visit only tw o times the dietician, and the patients who receive Orlistat for one ye ar visit the dietician every three months. A food diary was given to each patient. The medi cation costs per patient were taken from the Pharmacotherapeutic Kompas. An Orlistat tablet has to be taken three times a day during a meal. Table 8.1: Intervention cost s per patient (2005 euros) Period and type of costs Units Unit price Costs Total costs year 1 10-20 2,07 20,70-41,40 120-240 12,85 12,85 Orlistat (3 tablets per day) Minimum only 3 months Maximum for 12 months 50% 50% 45 (45 tablets of 120 mg.) 270 1080 Intervention effects of a low- calorie diet (Finer, 2001) and of diet in combination with Orlistat on weight after one year were taken from the internati onal literature (Li et al., 2005). These were then translated into long term weight loss by assuming that about 20% of the weigth loss after one year can be mainta ned in the long run (Anderson et al., 2001). The health gains of long term weight loss we re estimated using the RIVM Chronic Disease Model (CDM) (Hoogenveen et al., 1998; Van Baal et al., 2005; Van B aal et al., 2006d). The CDM is a dynamic population model that describe s the life course of cohorts in terms of transitions between risk factor classes and changes between disease states over time. Body weight is modeled in three classes using Body Mass Index (BMI) as indicator: BMI<25 (normal weight), 25 BMI<30 (overweight), BMI 30 (obesity). To estimate differences in QALYs and lifetime health care costs due to the intervention, effects of long term weight loss were translated into differences in obesity prevalence. This was done by subtracting the long RIVM report 270091004 page 101 of 163 term weight loss achieved through the intervention from the weight distribution of the target population and then comparing the differences in obesity prevalence. This was done using data on the BMI distribution from the NS2 study (Westert et al., 2006). QALYs gained were then calculated by multiplying differences in obesity prevalence by the difference in health-adjusted life expectancy between an obese pe rson and an overweight person (age and sex specific since all parameters and variables in the CDM are specified by gender and age). Analogously, differences in lifet ime health care costs are estim ated with CDM. To compute health effects in terms of QALYs, data from th e Dutch Burden of Disease Study (Stouthard et al., 1997) are used in the CDM (Van Baal et al ., 2006c; Van Baal et al., 2006d; Van Baal et al., 2005). Health care costs in the CDM are based on the Dutch Costs of Illness study (Slobbe et al., 2006). Cost-effectiveness was ev aluated from a health care perspective and included intervention costs and differences in li fetime medical costs (Van Baal et al., 2006b). Effects and costs were discounted at 1.5% a nd 4.0% annually, respectively. The time horizon for assessing future health impact was 100 year s since this allows the target population to become extinct in order to estimate lifetime effects. Table 8.2 summarizes the assumptions and input data used. page 102 of 163 RIVM report 270091004 Table 8.2: Summary of assumptions and input data Diet only: Low calory diet for everybody in target population, in combination with counselling by a dietician Diet + Orlistat: Low calory diet for everybody in target population, in combination with counselling by a dietician, 50% receives Orlistat for 3 months, 50% receives Orlistat one year Target population all Dutch people between 20 and 70 years with a BMI>30 that receive no care at all for their obesity (80% of the population BMI>30) 1.1 million people all Dutch people between 20 and 70 years with a BMI>30 that receive no care at all for their obesity (80% of the population BMI>30) 1.1 million people Deterministic parameters Discount rate 4.0% costs and 1.5% effects 4.0% costs and 1.5% effects Time horizon 100 years 100 years Average gain in QALYs per person* 1.45 1.45 Average difference in lifetime health care costs per person** \u20ac 5000 \u20ac 5000 Stochastic parameter Intervention costs GP time Dietician time GP time Dietician time Weight loss after one year diet in kilogram (Finer, 2001) Normal distribution Mean: 3.2 SD: 0.54 Normal distribution Mean: 3.2 SD: 0.54 Weight loss after one year Orlistat in kilogram (Li et al., 2005) Normal distribution Mean: 2.7 SD: 0.31 Succesfull weigth loss SD: 0.015 Normal distribution Mean: 0.23 SD: 0.015 * discounted at 1.5% ** discounted at 4% 8.3 Results Figure 8.1 displays a cost-effectiveness plane of diet and diet + Orlista t compared to usual care for the average person rece iving the intervention for different values of the input parameters as specified in Table 8.2.

Figure 8.2 displays the CEACs for usual ca re, diet and diet + Orlistat. What can be derived from Figure 8.2 is that for low monetary values placed on a QALY neither diet nor diet + Orlistat is pr obably cost-effective. For values places on a QALY between \u20ac 15,000 and \u20ac 65,000 diet alone is pr obably most cost-effective. For values higher than \u20ac 65,000 diet + Orlistat is probably mo st cost-effective. page 104 of curves for usual care, diet and diet in combination with Orlistat 8.4 Conclusions on cost-effectiveness of intervention Compared to previous studies, this modelling exercise reveals a higher cost-effectiveness ratio for the treatment of obesity through a diet in combination with Orlistat. One of the explanations for the different results is the difference in the methods used to calculate QALYs. A study by Hertzman (2005) used a much shorter time horizon (5 years) and assumed a direct effect of decreases in BMI on improvements in quality of life based on a study by Hakim et al. (2002). They assumed improvements in QOL during the first years after the intervention. In the model, improvements are assumed in quality of life through a reduced risk on disease incidence. The methodology accounts for much smaller gains in quality of life during normal life years (i.e. life years that would have also been lived without the intervention) (Van Baal et al., 2006d). Furthermore, the effect that quality of life generally decreases with advancing age was taken into account. This is important, since obviously the life years gained occur at high ages. This approach mostly resembles the approach used by Roux et al. (2006) in the sense that a lifetime perspective was used. They tracked lifetime costs and took into account the same amount of long term weight loss maintenance. However, they did not take into account effects of diseases in life years gained on quality of life. This may explain the large differences between costs per life year gained and costs per QALY gained they found. Ideally, BMI should be modelled as a continuous risk factor which allows a direct computation of health gains due to weight changes. However, in the model three different BMI classes were used with average relative risks computed using the BMI distribution within these classes in the Netherlands. This means that health gains for persons with extreme obesity were underestimated, and that health gains for persons with moderate obesity were overestimated. To what extent this approach results in biased estimates of health gains and therefore in biased estimates of the ICER is difficult to hypothesize. Another crucial assumption was that weight loss maintenance was equal in both diet and diet plus Orlistat intervention. There is some evidence that weight loss maintenance is higher in RIVM report 270091004 page 105 of 163 pharmacological treatment (Mathus-Vliegen, 2005) which would improve the cost- effectiveness of pharmacological treatment of obesity relative to a diet only. Since cost-effectiveness analysis requires assumptions about the effectiveness on interventions on BMI in the long term, the outcomes of the scen arios presented in this study should be interpreted with caution. In this study, it was assumed that 20% of the weight loss was maintained in the long run. If this relapse was not taken into account, costs would be substantially lower: \u20ac 8,000 per QALY gained for diet only and \u20ac 24,000 per QALY gained for diet in combination with Or listat. It has been shown that longer and active follow up can prevent weight regain (Saris, 2001). However, th is would involve additional costs and thus it is difficult to hypothesize to what extent this would influence cost-effectiveness. page 106 of 163 RIVM report 270091004 RIVM report 270091004 page 107 of 163 9. Conclusion and discussion on part B of this report In the former report on economic evaluations of preventive interventions evidence was presented from international cost-effectiven ess analyses on the cost-effectiveness of prevention of recurrent depression by mainte nance cognitive behavi oural therapy (mCBT), and the prevention of chronic diseases by pharm acologic treatment of obesity (Vijgen et al., 2005). Both these interventions appeared to be cost-effective in a foreign setting. By modelling both interventions within a Dutch setting and using in the case of obesity prevention a different modelling approach, a fe w important lessons can be learned. First of all, our results demonstrate that both interv entions have less favourab le cost-effectiveness ratios than presented so-far in the literature. In case of mCBT, the ratios still remain below the threshold of \u20ac 20,000 employed in this study. In case of Orlis tat treatment, the ratio was more than \u20ac 60,000. However, a low calorie diet appeared to be more cost-effective than pharmacological treatment of obesity with a mean ICER of \u20ac 18,000 per QALY gained. Differences in the cost-effectiv eness of mCBT can partly be explained by the setting of the Dutch GP that was chosen. Since already a lo t of people diagnosed by the GP with major depression receive evidence based care through antid epressants, the room for potential health gains is relatively limited. However, the presen t results suggest that even in this setting, health gains can be achieved at a low cost if the GP redirects persons with depressive symptoms to mCBT instead of prescribing me dication. An important new insight is that mCBT yields most health gains at a lower pr ice in people just rec overed from a depressive episode. This means that if mCBT would be o ffered to the current popu lation of depressive persons in the GP setting, health gains would be lower. It should be noted that in both modelling studies, additional res earch is needed that can improve estimates of cost- effectiveness considerably. In th e modelling study of mCBT mainly foreign data were used to fill parameters of the model. It deserves recommendation to incorporate more Dutch data into the model. Furthermore, more research should be devoted to relapse and recovery of persons diagnosed with depression. In case of weigth loss interventions, a cr ucial parameter that needs more research is long term weigth loss. A health-economic evaluation from the health ca re perspective was performed. It concentrated on effects of interventions on heal th and health care costs and co mpared these with intervention costs. This may be relevant information for th e health care decision maker, who may be primarily concerned with health care costs (Brouw er et al., 2006; Van B aal et al., 2006a). We did not present effects on productivity costs and did not take into account effects on informal care. Taking this into account, in turn, would suggest a societal pe rspective to be used in cost- effectiveness analysis to demonstrate the br oader societal costs and benefits from the interventions (Brouwer and K oopmanschap, 2000). Such a broa der perspective is normally advocated in economic evaluations, since it give s a complete picture of welfare changes in society associated with some in tervention (Meltzer, 1997). A next step, therefore, would be to assess the cost-effectiveness of these interventions from a societal perspective. page 108 of 163 RIVM report 270091004 RIVM report 270091004 page 109 of 163 References Chapters 1 and 2: Introduction and Methods De Wit GA, Brouwer WBF.

Some questions can be excluded then (wit h #) or reformulated (with *). Questions 1. What is your expertise?# 2. Have you been part of an evaluation study (from 2003*) concerning preventive interventions yourself? 3. If question is answered with yes: Were economic aspects examined in that study? 4. Do you know published economic evaluations of prevention in the literature? Think of grey literature (not peer-reviewed) as well, and of research reports. 5. Do you know Dutch research (since 2003*) that focus on economic effects of prevention? Foreign studies can be mentioned here as well. 6. Are there preventive interventions of which you think they are cost-saving or otherwise interesting from an economic point of view? Although no evidence base is known. 7. Which other persons from the RIVM should we interview? 8. Which other persons from outside the RIVM should we interview?

Did we include all important economic evalua tion studies in our ove rview of the topic you have knowledge on? 11. Are there currently Dutch studies being carri ed out on the cost-effectiveness of this preventive intervention? 12. Do you know of any studies on the intervention th at are not published because of lack of (cost-)effectiveness? 13. Is there sufficient evidence for the effec tiveness of the preventive intervention? 14. To what extent are results from foreign studies about the cost-effectiv eness transferable to the Dutch setting / On which issues does the context of foreign studies differ most from the Dutch situation? Think of: demographic factors, epidemiological factors, cultural factors, differences between countries in medical procedures, differences between countries in health care consumption, differences between countries in financing of health care, differences between countries in financia l incentives to health care suppliers and patients, absolute and relative price differences between countries. 15. To what extent is the intervention alr eady implemented in the Netherlands? 16. Which bottlenecks exist regarding imple mentation of the intervention? 17. Which factors encourage implementation? 18. Several countries have implemented the in tervention. Why is it implemented there and not in the Netherlands? 19. Is the intervention feasible: practically, financially, ethically? 20. How should the intervention be implemented in the Netherlands? 21. Which initiatives are already set up around the implementation of the intervention? Think of: page 134 of 163 RIVM report 270091004 ZonMw funding, experimental projects, advisory bodies, consensus meetings et cetera 22. Does everyone have the same opinion on impl ementation of the intervention or are there major differences in opinions? 23. Which other experts (either w ith a practical view or with a more theoretical vision ) could I approach for an interview about this intervention? 24. Are you willing to comment on our draf t text about this intervention? 25. May I include your name in the list of expe rts that is to appear in our report?
