Using digitized data on the existence of naturopathic associations in Germany in the year 1900, we first show that counties with a large number of naturopathic associations in 1900 were disproportionally located in East Germany. Furthermore, counties with a higher number of naturopathic associations in 1900 have significantly lower COVID-19 vaccination rates today. Our IV estimates suggest that the long-term effects of the naturopathic movement can explain about half of the East-West gap in COVID-19 vaccination rates.", "sitename": "CEPR", "date": "2023-04-24", "cleaned_text": "Vaccine Hesitancy in Germany: The 19th-Century Naturopathic Movement This paper studies the historical roots of vaccine hesitancy in the context of Germany.
