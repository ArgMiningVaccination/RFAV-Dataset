{"title": "Unmarked graves near Cowessess First Nation - Statement of the Department of Pediatrics", "author": null, "url": null, "hostname": null, "description": null, "sitename": null, "date": "2018-08-03", "cleaned_text": "We are overwhelmed by grief with the horrifying news out of Cowessess First Nation regarding 751 unmarked graves at the site of a former residential school. What was known by Indigenous people for decades has now been found for all to see. It is impossible to overstate the devastation that residential schools wrought on generations of Indigenous children and their families. Today's children are still harmed by these effects and ongoing systemic inequities. We recognize the part that our health care system played in perpetuating these atrocities and that there is much work to do in dismantling the systemic racism and discrimination, which continues to oppress our patients today. There are well-established starting points to help our society heal from this grievously oppressive past. The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Persons is not yet fully implemented in Canada, and neither are many of the Calls to Action from the Truth and Reconciliation Inquiry or the Murdered and Missing Indigenous Women and Girls Inquiry. We would ask both federal and provincial governments to lead us, as well as our communities, in prioritizing action for our future as we acknowledge the unspeakable tragedies of our past. Sincerely, Members of the Department of Pediatrics, SK Treaty 2, Treaty 4, Treaty 5, Treaty 8, Treaty 10 and Treaty 6 Territory and Homeland of the M\u00e9tis News Loading... About Us What we do Our Services are offered in Saskatoon, along with numerous traveling clinics that are conducted regularly at sites throughout the province. We are dedicated to providing exemplary health care for children, ensuring excellence in training of future pediatrics health care providers, undertaking meritorious research and advocating for the health and well-being of children and youth. Divisions and Services Pediatric cardiology helps children with heart conditions. Kids can get support and treatment from before birth (fetal life) up to and including age 16. Heart conditions include: - Heart defects - Heart rhythm issues - Heart muscle issues The pediatric cardiology team is based at the Jim Pattison Children's Hospital in Saskatoon and provide services at the Regina General Hospital every week. Kids can receive treatment, heart ultrasounds and other heart tests through their pediatric cardiologist at these hospitals and in outpatient (non-overnight) clinics. In some cases, the team can be accessed through Telehealth if you and your child are unable to visit these two hospitals. Mending Little Hearts The [Mending Little Hearts Fund of Saskatchewan](https://mendinglittlehearts.ca/) is a designated charitable fund which was created in partnership with the Jim Pattison Children's Hospital Foundation of Saskatchewan. It is made up of a group of passionate volunteers who bring varied experience to the team. This dynamic group of people includes Pediatric Cardiologists, Nurse Clinicians, Echosonographers, Psychologists, Dieticians, Social Workers, Administration Staff, Exercise Therapists, Researchers from the University of Saskatchewan and the University of Regina, and volunteer heart parents. This fund contributes to the health, wellbeing and survival of children living with heart conditions across Saskatchewan by: - Providing additional essential clinical equipment for families to use at home to monitor their child's status. - Allowing a child and family to attend CHAMPS Camp. - Supporting local research for children with heart conditions. - Developing family support services and educational resources. Research The research team of the Mending Little Hearts Fund is made up of doctors and researchers from the College of Kinesiology, College of Medicine at the University of Saskatchewan and the Department of Psychology at the University of Regina. The research team contributes to and helps facilitate programming at CHAMPS Camp, in addition to numerous research initiatives outside of camp involving children, youth, and adults with CHD.

Learn more about CHAMPS Camp [here](https://mendinglittlehearts.ca/champs-camp/) Saskatchewan's pediatric intensive care unit provides innovative and sophisticated life sustaining therapy for all critically ill children in the province. Although situated in the Royal University Hospital in Saskatoon, coordinated systems, a dedicated pediatric transport team and remote robotic technology allow for quick access to critical care expertise regardless of a child's postal code. In efforts to meet the increasing demands of a growing population, programs continue to develop ensuring that the children of Saskatchewan have access to the highest level of care possible. [https://picusaskatchewan.ca](https://picusaskatchewan.ca) Programs 1. Transport Team Pediatric specialized transport has evolved since it's inception 20 years ago, and plays an integral role in Saskatchewan's pediatric critical care delivery. With broader geographic access and advancements in skills and technology, our pediatric specialized transport team is able to extend timely critical care into rural and remote communities. Through extensive support from Jim Pattison's children's hospital foundation, Saskatchewan's pediatric critical care transport team performs over 500 transports per year. The team safely transports children between provincial facilities, enabling assess to the appropriate level of care. With highly sophisticated ventilators, advanced cardiopulmonary monitoring and portable blood work, the team is able to initiate life sustaining therapy in a timely manner. To deliver the highest quality care, our research for this program focuses on patient outcome metrics, and scoring systems that assess severity of illness. 2. Remote Presence Telehealth Universal and timely access to pediatric specialized care is a substantial challenge. Saskatchewan's geographical range makes provision of medical expertise in remote communities extremely difficult. Utilizing remote presence robotic devices have helped to bridge these challenges, allowing us to directly visualize and examine critically ill patients for a prompt diagnosis and accurate treatment plan. Our recently published studies reflect the safety and feasibility of this innovative technology, and how we are trying to close the access gap that permeates health care. We currently support 3 northern communities and thanks to the ongoing commitment from the Saskatchewan ministry of health partnered with Jim Pattison Children's Hospital Foundation, our goal is to service an additional 5 communities during 2018. We will continue expanding until all Saskatchewan children have timely access to our subspecialty support, regardless of their postal code. 3. Neurocritical Care Nearly 25% of children admitted to PICUs have either a new injury to their brain/spinal cord or a neurologic complication of their illness. Despite the expertise found in children's hospitals, there remains an unmet need for these very vulnerable patients: the breadth of neurologic injuries is immense but the research supporting clinical practice is poor. Pediatric neurocritical care has recently emerged as a subspecialty. The Jim Pattison Children's Hospital had the vision to develop this area, and currently provides innovative care through multidisciplinary expertise from neurology, critical care, neurosurgery, psychiatry and neuroradiology. Newer developments include the utilization of non invasive ultrasound monitoring for traumatic brain imaging (transcranial dopplers and optic nerve sheath diameters), improved access to continuous electroencephalography, quick brain MRI (to minimize CT radiation exposure), early mobilization and delirium screening. Several exciting and novel initiatives are currently in the planning stages. 4. Extracorporeal Therapies Critically ill pediatric patients may require advanced technologies to support failing organ systems. Over the years, we have developed the following: - Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy (CRRT) is a form of dialysis utilized for serious kidney injuries in some of our sickest patients. The Jim Pattison Children's Hospital Foundation was integral in supporting the initiation of this program in 2007. - Therapeutic apheresis results in the removal of blood components that are disease or symptom causing. Children with severe infections, neuromuscular diseases, hematologic/thrombotic disorders may be overwhelmed by inflammation and clotting and require plasma exchange. Utilizing the Spectra Optia aphaeresis system (donated by the JPCHF), Saskatchewan's PICU has performed over a 100 treatments for a variety of disease processes. Recently, leukopheresis has been introduced, to assist children with high white cells in certain cancers. - Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) has become an essential tool in the care of children with cardiac and pulmonary failure that has not responded to conventional management. In collaboration with our pediatric cardiologists, surgeons, and perfusionists, ECMO is initiated when necessary. 5. Respiratory Care Our multidisciplinary team of physicians, respiratory therapists and nurses strive for excellence in respiratory care through the use of standard and emerging therapies. Our expertise includes high flow therapy, non-invasive ventilation and non-conventional therapies such as non-invasive high frequency oscillatory ventilation (nHFOV), invasive high frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) and high frequency jet ventilation (HFJV). Through innovative technologies we are pushing conventional boundaries to provide unique and individualized respiratory care to meet the needs of our patients. The Jim Pattison Children's Hospital Foundation has allowed us to become pediatric leaders of electrical impedance tomography (EIT) by equipping our unit with Dr\u00e4ger Pulmovista 500 technology. We also employ other tools including lung ultrasound and quasi-static pressure-volume measurements. 6. Research Our innovation and desire to advance patient care is deeply rooted in a philosophy of ethical clinical research. Guided by the scientific process, our programs continue to develop and evolve with the goal to optimize patient care. Led by specialized intensive care researchers, important clinical problems or questions are scrutinized, dissected and then studied in a concerted fashion. Our research continues to be well supported by institutional, Jim Pattison Children's Hospital Foundation, provincial, and national grants. Sharing our research is critical to the program, as our discoveries may help other critical care providers with their difficult patients or scenarios. We are proud of our published work in peer review journals. 7. The Pediatric Simulation Program The care of pediatric patients is becoming increasingly complex, and requires skills and knowledge sharing between multiple caregivers. Simulations are scenarios designed to closely approximate real situations - usually for the purposes of training or evaluation. Medical simulation based education and training provides an opportunity for team training without exposing patients to unnecessary harm. With tremendous support from the Jim Pattison Children's Hospital Foundation, we use the Laerdal SimJunior patient simulator, which can be operated remotely using a tablet-based device. SimJunior represents a 6-year-old child that simulates a wide range of conditions from a healthy, talking child to an unresponsive, critically ill patient. The Simulation Program supports orientation and skill maintenance for new and existing members of the PICU, Pediatric Inter-facility Transport Team, and pediatric providers on the ward. Developmental disorders may include cognitive or learning disabilities, global developmental delays, autism, neuromotor conditions such as cerebral palsy, genetic disorders, communication disorders, hearing or visual impairments, and behavioral disorders. Developmental pediatricians provide consultation and work closely with a child's or youth's \"circle of care,\" integrating information from other specialists and allied health team members. They advocate for optimizing child and youth abilities within the family, learning environment, culture and community. Our outpatient setting, the Alvin Buckwold Child Development Program (ABCDP), is a unique place for kids to learn and grow. We offer diagnostic and treatment services to children 0-18 years of age, as well as support for families. Our commitment is to serve children and adolescents who display, or are at significant risk for, developmental, cognitive and/or physical challenges. Using a family-centered approach, we work in partnership with parents to try to understand the specific needs of their child. We are open to receiving requests from parents and caregivers, physicians and other agencies.

The instructional methods used include: informal bedside teaching, formal lectures, outpatient teaching, experience in doctors' offices, experience in special clinics, participation in various academic rounds, and taking part in patient care activities under supervision. This will be supplemented by individual reading about important topics in the pediatric core material. While on the wards, students are expected to take responsibility, under supervision, of the day-to-day care of their assigned patients. The instructional objectives of the rotation include general pediatric objectives with regard to knowledge, skills and attitudes, and specific objectives related to particular topics and organ systems. The student will develop clinical skills which include: interviewing the parent and the patient, the taking of a complete history, the performance of a proper physical examination, and the completion of medical records in approved style. The student will also be taught to communicate these facts to other members of the health team at the bedside, during seminar hours, or in the classroom and will be taught to correlate the information obtained into a problem list and make appropriate plans for managing them. The student will be made aware of the value and application of specialized help from other health personnel and community resources. He/she will be encouraged to make use of the reference library, textbooks, journals, tapes and other resources dealing with clinical pediatrics. Students are expected to read around their cases and to expand their general pediatric knowledge by independent learning to supplement academic half-day, JURSI seminars and clinical teaching. STRUCTURE OF THE ROTATION Saskatoon - Four-week rotation on one of two pediatric inpatient units (Orange, Purple) at Royal University Hospital - Two weeks in Pediatric Outpatient Clinics attending general and subspecialist pediatric clinics as well as Pediatric Emergency shifts and one day in the NICU. Subspecialist pediatric clinics include those that are on-site at the Royal University Hospital, as well as Social Pediatrics and Developmental Pediatrics Clinics. Social Pediatrics are run out of school-based clinics. Developmental Pediatrics clinics are based at the Kinsmen Children's Centre. The Department of Pediatrics offers funding for 4 years within our core General Pediatric Residency program. Residents may choose to do 3 core years, and then go on to pursue a fellowship at an institution elsewhere; or stay on to complete their 4th year at the University of Saskatchewan. The Pediatric Residency Program is fully accredited by the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada. The Department offers accredited subspecialty fellowship training in Neonatal-Perinatal Medicine and Neurology. Core Pediatric Residency Program: The program endeavours to ensure that residents, upon completion of their training, are well equipped to provide comprehensive Pediatric care to all patients - from consultative Pediatric services to management of the critically ill patient. Quick Facts: - We have 26-28 residents within our program - Most of the Pediatric subspecialties are represented. For those that are currently not offered, residents may do an away selective in each of years 2-4, in addition to their elective time - Our Social Pediatrics division provides trainees with the opportunity to learn about access to care through school-based clinics - Dynamic growing Pediatric Faculty dedicated to teaching - Childrens Hospital of Saskatchewan is underway Objectives for the Pediatric Training Program: - During the 3 or 4 years of training, residents gain competency through comprehensive exposure to a diverse Pediatric population. - At completion of their training, residents are expected to demonstrate competency to practice as a General Pediatric Consultant. - Residents must have met the requirements in all of the 7 CanMEDs Roles. - Residents must demonstrate professionalism; have good communication skills; understand and demonstrate how to collaboratively work within a health care team; advocate for patients and families at various levels; demonstrate the ability to be a self-directed learner. Knowledge and skills acquired include: - Recognition of normal/variations in normal growth and development of infants, children and youth - Recognition and management of a wide range of Pediatric problems and diagnoses; both common presentations of common problems/uncommon presentations of common problems - Recognition and management of the acutely ill child - Resuscitation of the sick newborn - Critical appraisal, research methodology and application of evidence-based medicine - Teaching and supervisory skills | | Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada: Applying competency-based practices to residency education To contribute to the success of Canadian physicians and the delivery of high-quality patient care, the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada has embarked upon an initiative to introduce competency-based medical education (CBME) in Canadian postgraduate specialty training and in professional practice in Canada. This initiative, called CBD will use The Royal College anticipates that all specialty and subspecialty programs in Canada will adopt CBD in gradual phases. All disciplines have been divided into seven cohort groups, each of which will adopt CBD at different times. It is anticipated that national implementation of CBD within certain, individual programs could begin as early as July 2017 - with more disciplines to following in subsequent years. All programs implementing CBD will continue to undergo the same rigorous accreditation processes as traditional programs. All CBD programs (and traditional programs) will continue to lead to Royal College approved certification. Certification for trainees in both CBD and traditional programs will include the completion of a Royal College examination; however, residents in CBD programs will also be assessed against program milestones throughout their training. Within a CBD program, all milestones (documented within an electronic portfolio) and the Royal College examination must be successfully completed to achieve certification. For more information, please contact the USask Department of Pediatrics Residency Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI) Committee This committee was created to ensure that EDI is woven throughout the ethos of the pediatric residency program. The committee is represented by pediatric residents from both our Saskatoon and Regina site and pediatric faculty members and is informed by EDI policies from both the College of Medicine and the University of Saskatchewan. Together we collectively create EDI specific initiatives within the residency program and contribute to those within the Pediatric department. Current examples of incorporating EDI focused material within the program include hosting EDI Grand Rounds presentations, leading local EDI events, such as Orange Shirt Week, informing and visioning new initiatives within our pediatric academic and clinical programing. Representatives attend EDI meetings in both local and national forums. Looking forward, the committee is developing a resource tool with an extensive list of EDI focused funding and educational opportunities.

Research shows an increasing prevalence of T2D in communities around the world, including in Canada. In Canada, some of the highest incidence rates are found in the First Nations pediatric population in the Prairie provinces. The Saskatchewan Prevention Institute partnered with Dr. Mark Inman (Pediatric Endocrinologist, Saskatchewan Health Authority) to bring together current evidence and data relevant to Saskatchewan and increase the understanding of the strengths, gaps, and needs related to pediatric T2D within Saskatchewan. The partnership resulted in the development of this background report, based on a literature review, needs assessment survey, and environmental scan, which will inform future work regarding pediatric T2D in Saskatchewan. The report will be used first to inform the development of relevant resources for education and training for healthcare providers, and second, to develop appropriate education for patients and families, within the Saskatchewan context.
