Makes 8 Gallons |Kills Bed Bugs When They are Most Vulnerable | Kleen Green is an effective, environmentally friendly, non-toxic treatment that exterminates bed bugs without the use of toxic pesticides, using a unique blend of organic enzymes. All types of insects are affected by enzymes, the biology of insects depends on the creation of enzymes for their survival. It is impossible for insects to develop a resistance to enzymes used as a method of pest control. Bed bugs and other insects have an ability to rapidly evolve an immunity or resistance to many common commercial pesticides within a short period of time, even within a single crop cycle. This leads to a costly rotation of toxic chemicals. Sadly, human beings do not have the biological tolerance to the persistent pollution of pesticides that insects do, and are often the victims compromised by pesticide use. Fortunately we have found a consistent, safe reliable solution for controlling bed bugs - natural enzymes. Bed bugs are made up of a high concentration of protein. [Kleen Green](/kleen-green.aspx) contains an active ingredient that causes the insect to molt (shed its outer coating) prematurely. It is during this molting phase that an insect is at its most vulnerable - susceptible to drying out or drowning since the hard shell that normally would protect them has been cast off or removed. It is necessary for all insects to shed their exoskeletons several times during the course of their life. They accomplish this by using enzymes they create naturally to split open their exoskeleton and thus allowing them to grow. | | [ ](#) | | Because commercial pesticides are comprised of chemicals which are volatile, synthetic and poisonous, the EPA prohibits registered pesticides from claiming they are either safe or non-toxic. However, Kleen Green is in fact, a natural biological bed bug killer that affects insects based on physical rather than chemical properties.
