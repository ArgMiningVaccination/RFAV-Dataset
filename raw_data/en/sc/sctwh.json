A doctor of osteopathic medicine (DO) or certified osteopathic physician at One Source Integrative Medicine will begin by asking a set of questions to determine your current health status. They may also request X-rays and other tests to be carried out to get a complete look at your health, including tests to determine your mental well-being, current lifestyle, and diet. Your doctor may also perform a hands-on osteopathic manipulative treatment during your actual appointment, depending on what symptoms you may be experiencing.
