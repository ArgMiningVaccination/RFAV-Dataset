It is recognized that, even when there are programs and resources in placeto treat older adults with signs of depression andto provide support to the family of the olderadult, there are barriers that impede individualsfrom accessing mental health services. Barriers to mental wellness in older adults are found in all communities but rural areas offerextra challenges such as the isolating effects ofgreat distances from services, major centres andeven neighbours. Also, transportation in theseoutlying areas is a major problem. The mentalhealth services that are available tend to be found in cities or major centres. Many seniors donot drive and are dependent for transportationupon a dwindling circle of family and friends.Additionally , the waiting period for assessmentand treatment by a specialist is lengthy . Another major barrier seniors experience is the myth that being old and being sad is somehownormal or acceptable. It is well known thatmental health issues carry negative connotations,especially with the elderly who associate themwith weakness, madness or a fear they will beinstitutionalized. Chalifoux et al (1996) alsobelieve that this generation hides or ignoressymptoms and so figures are under-reported.Rost et al (1994) echo this in their study of how rural physicians manage depression in ruralpatients. They suggest that because of the stigmaof mental illness in rural areas, depression is often noted and treated very subtly , but notformally diagnosed, indicating that the rates for rural depression are actually higher than reported. The Project: Aging Well in Rural Places These and other barriers are the subject of a project now underway through the AtlanticHealth Promotion Research Centre (AHPRC) at Dalhousie University , in partnership with the departments of health in the four AtlanticProvinces. The title of the research project isAging Well in Rural Places: Development and Pilot T esting of a Community Based Strategy toAddress Depression in Seniors in Atlantic Canada . The Principal Researcher for the project is Dr. Renee Lyons, Director of the AHPRC. 28 1 VOLUME 100 MARCH 2002Goal of the Project The goal of the project is to design an evidence- based strategy for developing social marketingmessages and formats in communities to addressproblems of depression among rural seniors inAtlantic Canada, in order to improve the mentalhealth and quality of life of this growing segmentof the population. Researchers will work with partners and volunteers in the pilot sites to seek ways for buildingcommunity capacity and cooperative solutions. The Process This is a qualitative and participatory projectassisted by seniors in rural areas where focusgroups and interviews with key members of thecommunity are helping to explore the issue ofdepression in rural elderly . In particular, theproject is focusing on situational depression inrural seniors, depression arising from stressfullife events such as the death of a spouse, chronicillness, multiple losses, the strain of constantcaregiving etc. Participants in the focus groupsand interviews share known barriers to accessinghelp for mental problems and some suggestionsfor making improvements for the future. With the assistance of LURA Consulting, a local community-based social marketing firm,techniques will be applied to the findings of theproject, and will result in strategies for behaviourchanges such as, seniors and families activelyreaching out for help or learning strategies toprevent depression in the first place. Four pilotstudy sites are Musquodoboit, NS,Caraquet, County , PEI. All participants andresearchers are seeking ways to enhance thecapacities of communities and to develop projectpartners to help address the issue. Older Surfers by Cynthia Silver Every day , the Internet becomes more embedded in our lives. Business, media and government areembracing it as a way to provide services to theirclients and the general public. Schools requirechildren and teens to use it as a research tool andlibraries and community centres offer access tothose without a home connection. The 2000 General Social Survey (GSS) shows that nearly every teenager used the Net but thatuse drops quickly with each successive agegroup. Older Canadians are much less likely touse the Internet than young people, though theirnumbers are growing: in doing so, manyCanadians aged 60 and over may reduce theimpact of social isolation following retirementand the onset of age-related health conditions.Older adults are benefiting from access tonetworked communities through the Internet. Older people are the fastest growing group of users. Among Canadians aged 60 and over, only13% (614,000) had used the Internet in 1999. Ofthose aged 60 and over, men were nearly twice aslikely (17%) as women (9%) to use the Net. Use grew fastest among those aged 60 and over from 1999 to 2000. Growth was strongest amongolder women, 43% of whom had started usingthe Net in the last year compared with 25% ofolder men. On average, older surfers spent anaverage of 6 hours per week on the Net, aboutthe same as 45 to 54 year-olds. Most older users (80%) go online for personal interest or entertainment. Older Canadiansprimarily searched for online information ongoods and services (57% of surfers), news (54%) and health information (38%). Half of older surfers looked for online travel information and 41%looked for information on arts, entertainment or sports. One-third looked for business oreconomic news. As people age, they may tend to become socially isolated. A lower income after retirement,declining physical ability and the loss of a spouseare examples of changes that may cause olderCanadians to lose touch with people. However, the Internet seems to be a valuable tool in maintaining contact with others. Nearly allolder Internet users (87%) used e-mail and theywere sending messages almost as often asyounger people: 69% who had used it in the lastmonth did so at least several times a week, as did76% of those under age 60. Although olderpeople e-mailed their family more often thanyounger people did, old and young e-mail userswere equally likely to stay in touch with friends.And while women have had the traditional roleof sustaining family relationships, men were just as likely as women to use e-mail to keep in touch. Home connections are more popular amongolder people as they generally have moremobility and transportation problems to dealwith, which suggests they have limited access tolocations with Internet connections. A homeconnection offers older adults the opportunity tosocialize with others, pursue life-long learningand participate in community activities. It canassist with activities of daily living such asshopping and managingmoney . Thirty-five percent Web-basedtraining, informal helpfrom a friend or relative aswell as trial and error to acquirecomputer skills. The Internet can open the world to older people who may feel isolated and lonely . Many seniors'groups now offer programs to help older adultsbecome familiar with computers and to assistthem with Internet access.

Please include yourname, address and telephone number on all correspondence. The Senior Citizens' Secretariat was established in 1980 to facilitate the planning and development of services and programs for seniors by coordinatingplans, policies and programs presented by the departments of the provincial government. The Secretariat serves as aone door entry to government for seniors,seniors' groups and other provincial bodies concerned with aging issues. The Secretariat develops plans, policiesand programs in partnership with otherlevels of government and agencies responsible for seniors. The Secretariat's office is located at 1740 Granville Street, 4th floor , P .O. Box 2065, 424-0561;toll-free 1-800-670-0065.Myths 1. There is just one sign language for all countries. Just as there is no one spoken language for all countries, there is no one, universal sign language. There are more than 100 sign languages used in the world today. Every sign language reflects itsown history, culture and social values, and mayhave many regional variations. 2. Only a few people have a hearing loss and chances are, I will not be affected. The odds are that you or someone close to you has some degree of haring loss. In fact, it hasbeen estimated that one in ten people experiencesome degree of hearing loss. 3. My child will be limited because of his/her deafness. Do not consider your child as sick. He or she is as normal as any other child; the only differenceis that he/she cannot hear . 4. All deaf people use sign language. Culturally deaf people use sign language. Many people with a hearing loss do not knowsign language. 5. All hearing losses are the same. The single term \"hearing loss\" covers a wide range of losses that have very different effects ona person's ability to process sound and, therefore,to understand speech. 6. Deaf people are not sensitive to noise. Some types of hearing loss actually accentuate sensitivity to noise. Loud sounds become garbledand uncomfortable. Hearing aid users often findloud sounds, which are greatly magnified bytheir aids, very unpleasant.7. Parents lose their deaf children to the deaf community . Deaf people who enjoyed a close rapport and good communication, signing or oral, with theirparents while growing up tend to remain close tothem for the rest of their lives. 8. All deaf and hard of hearing people are good speechreaders. Many factors are involved int the success of speachreading. People with a hearing loss are notinherently better speechreaders. 9. People with a cochlear implant have a hole in their head and cannot swim or take ashower. People can definitely swim and bathe with their implanted devices. There is no opening in thehead at all with modern devices. The implant iscompletely covered by the skin behind the ear .People need only to remove their extendedprocessor and headpiece before swimming orbathing, just as hearing aid users remove theiraids.Where are we now? The project is approximately at the halfway point. The initial data collection is completedand findings have undergone two levels ofanalysis, initially at the community level bycommunity working groups mostly comprised ofseniors and then at the regional level to identifycommon themes and barriers. Recommendationsfrom the community working groups will help togenerate draft community-based social marketingmessages and strategies that will be tested in thepilot communities for their potential to create thedesired changes in behaviour. What is next? After the messages are tested in the pilotcommunities they will undergo final revisionsand be put to use in the pilot communities.Recommendations will be made to the provincialpartners and Health Canada for using similarmessages and strategies across the Atlantic regionand nationally . It is hoped that armed withbehaviour-based messaging and newly developedpartnerships, rural Atlantic communities willhave avenues to improve the mental healthoutlook and quality of life of their seniors. The project ends in August of 2002. References: 1. In, Abraham, I.L. Buckwalter, K.C., Chalifoux, Z., Litwak, E. & Neese, I.B.

Submitted by: Maureen Rogers, BN, M.Ed.The Changing Face of Retirement According to Statistics Canada, in 1970, 84 per cent of men aged 55 to 64 were in the laborforce, but that rate dropped to 60 per cent aquarter century later. For women in the same age group, the rate decreased only slightly . What's behind these changes? Early retirement programs and incentives are part of the reasonCanadians are retiring earlier. In 1987, theminimum age for receiving Canada/QuebecPension Plan benefits dropped to 60 from 65,and the proportion of Canadians aged 60 to 64drawing those benefits rose from 20 to 38 percent between 1987 and 1993. Private pensionplans also playa role in this trend. Retirement, of course, is not always a matter of choice. During Canada's recession a decade ago,211,000 Canadians retired earlier than they hadoriginally planned. Buyouts, layoffs and forcedretirement are also becoming a common reality . But retirement can no longer be defined simply in terms of age, years of service or pensioneligibility . Rather it is a life transition that reflects many factors: gender, occupation,financial status, family circumstances, health,lifestyle, education, the strength and stability ofan individual's employment situation, and theeconomy in general, as well as the interplay ofcurrent socio-economic policies and trends. In a StatsCan study on Canada's Changing Retirement Patterns, about half of retireesreported enjoying life more than the year beforethey retired. They were especially happy abouthaving more leisure time and time for family .One in five retirees enjoyed life less, giving asreasons poorer health, followed by less socialcontact and decreased income. About one-third of retirees believed their financial situation had worsened since retirement. Thisopinion was more common among youngerretirees and those forced into retirement. There is no one route to retirement. Nor does the journey end once you get there. It is the 26 3beginning of a new life stage. We need to plan for \u2014and beyond\u2014retirement. Today , retirementcan provide the opportunity to travel, volunteer,spend time with family and friends or do all thethings there never seemed to be time for before.Retirement can mean leaving a job or continuingto work full-time in a second career, part-time, or in a self-employed or freelance position. With our increased life expectancy (the average Canadian can now expect to live 78 years,compared with 59 in the 19205) many of us will be spending 20 or 30 years in retirement\u2014asignificant part of our life, for sure! And as Baby-Boomers (those born between 1946 and 1965)enter their 505, Canadians of retirement age willcontinue to be a growing force. Travel and leisureindustries will boom. In 1998, Sport Canada reported that golf, considered by many to be the ultimate symbol of the retired life, has replaced hockey asCanada's most popular sport. As well, retireesenjoy activities such as walking, gardening andcycling, and older Canadians are the age groupmost likely to take time to read. So as the population gets older and the Baby Boom generation approaches retirement, theneeds and lifestyle requirements of retirees willcontinue to change. In 1996, 11.2 per cent of Canadians were retired, according to a study by Statistics Canada onCanada's Changing Retirement Patterns. Here aresome of the findings of that study: 1. The highest percentage of retirees reside in British Columbia and Ontario (13 and 12per cent respectively). 2. Fourteen per cent of men and eight per cent of women reported being retired. Themajority of women aged 60 or over havenever been in the labor force. As more\"younger women\" now work outside thehome, the men versus women retirementratio is expected to balance out. 3. T wo-thirds of retirees (80 per cent of retired men, 45 per cent of the women)were married or living common-law. Tenper cent of retired women were single;almost 40 per cent of them widowed. Thisis not surprising given that womengenerally live longer than men and marry\"older\" men. Seventeen per cent of the menand 44 per cent of the women lived alone. 4. Women retired earlier than men (at age 58.5 compared with 61.4) to spend timewith their retired spouses, care for relativesor because of poor health. Men's reasonswere often related to their own health or toearly retirement packages. 5. Men eligible for registered retirement or pension benefits were more likely to retirebefore 65. Women with such plans, onaverage, worked to the age of 60.6 whilewomen without such benefits worked toage 57.4. 6. Part-time and self-employed workers delayed retirement for financial reasons, or because they were already slowing downin preparation for their retirement. Maleteachers retired earlier (59.4 years) thanmen in the service industry (60.8) and inconstruction and transportation (60.8).Female clerical workers retired earlier(56.8) than women in the primary sector(57.3) or those who were managers andprofessionals (57.8). 7. Thirteen per cent of retirees returned to work, usually as self-employed, part-timeor temporary workers. These \"retirees\"were more likely to be men, with a highereducation and \"younger.\" One-quarterreturned to work for financial reasons, one-half for other reasons, such as wantingto keep busy or for the social aspects.

Mr. Collenette also announced $167,450 for six sustainabletransportation projects as part of thefourth round of funding in the original phase ofthe program. These projects cover a range ofinitiatives that will contribute to a moreenvironmentally friendly transportation system. \"Projects funded through MOST over the past two years have successfully delivered concreteresults. Extension of this program for anotherfive years demonstrates Transport Canada'songoing commitment to fostering a sustainabletransportation system that is safe, efficient, cost-effective and beneficial for the environment,\"said Mr. Collenette. MOST fulfills a commitment made in Transport Canada's first Sustainable Development Strategy ,which was tabled in Parliament in 1997. Theprogram was launched with approximately $1million to be provided to successful projectproposals over a period of three and four fundingrounds. This funding has been allocated to 26initiatives aimed at encouraging sustainabletransportation. Final approval for funding issubject to meeting the financial and otherrequirements of the program.MOST assists organizations such as environmental groups, community associations,academic institutions, and business andprofessional associations. These groups are conducting projects and delivering concrete results in support of Transport Canada's commitment to sustainable transportation. In addition, the projects are helping to improve the public's understanding of sustainable transportation issues. Through MOST, Transport Canada is able to manage funding requests in a more transparent and equitable fashion. An advisory committee prioritizes projects and recommends funding allocations. Projects may receive up to a maximum of $100,000 over two years and mustreceive at least 50 percent of resources fromsources other that the Government of Canada. \"Through MOST, the Government of Canada is helping to find ways to meet the transportationneeds of Canadians, while helping to protect theenvironment for present and future generations,\"added Mr. Collenette. Funding for the extension of this program was provided for in the December 2001 budget and istherefore built into the current fiscal framework. Information on MOST, including an applicant's guide and project results, can be found onTransport Canada's web site athttp://www.tc.gc.ca/EnvAffairs/MOST/. 4 25Consultation on Natural Health Products The Proposed Regulatory Framework for natural health products was pre-published in the Canada Gazette , Part 1, on December 22, 2001.

The Senior Contact Program will allow police to contact seniors once a week to make sure theyare safe and healthy . Similar programs have beeninitiated in other places in Canada. An official contract was signed between police and the Cape Breton Council of Senior Citizensand Pensioners. The program will determine the number of seniors living in industrial Cape Breton whorequire or wish to have telephone contact due to being isolated or lonely with no family orneighborly contact, as well as any other seniorinterested in benefiting from this service. \"It's designed for seniors that are isolated,\" said Const. Brad Burke. \"What takes place is, duringthe week, we'll contact them or a member oftheir family , and if they're not available, we'llactually send a police car over to their home.\" Burke said some seniors in the area are living on their own. Some of them don't have muchcontact with other people and the program willlet the police know if they are OK. He noted there have been times when police have found seniors sick or injured in their residencesand unable to get help. He added there have alsobeen a number of occasions when police havefound seniors deceased in their homes. The program will prepare and implement telephone schedules based on the results of theassessed needs of seniors. In addition, it will provide a variety of activities for seniors to interact with other seniors of various backgrounds. Designed by the Cape Breton Council of Senior Citizens and Pensioners, the program is expectedto begin Jan. 28. It will be run out of theWhitney Pier Police Community Office. Call 563-5104 or 539-6511 for information on this free service.

Hearing impairment affects one in 10North Americans, and it is estimated that almosthalf of the population over 65 suffer from somedegree of hearing loss. Health professionals in avariety of disciplines can play a key role inhelping their patients/clients with hearing loss toaddress this common problem. Types of hearing loss Hearing loss can be classified in two main categories conductive and sensorineural. Conductive hearing loss is caused primarily by a mechanical problem in the middle ear or earcanal that disrupts or blocks the conduction ofsound. The result is a poor transmission of sound waves via the eardrum, the failure of the ossicular bones to transmit sound, or both. Commoncauses of conductive hearing loss includeexcessive wax blocking the ear, fluid in themiddle ear and a perforated eardrum. In most cases of conductive hearing loss, hearing can be restored to some degree, if not completely .This is achieved by removing or repairing thecause of the hearing loss. For example, wax canbe removed, infections treated and fluid drained. Even a damaged eardrum can be repaired through a precision surgical procedure using a minisculeskin graft. For severe or complete conductivehearing loss, special bone conduction hearingaids are available, as well as special devices calledbone anchored hearing aids {BAHA). Sensorineural hearing loss results from the reduced ability or failure of the nerve cells toreceive transmitted sound. In most cases,sensorineural hearing loss is not reversible andcompensatory management strategies are used. This type of hearing loss is often further broken down into sensory hearing loss (when the innerear is affected) or neural hearing loss (when theauditory nerve or nerve pathways in the brain are affected). Sensory hearing loss can be caused by genetic factors (i.e. heredity), exposure to loud and/orconstant noise (acoustic trauma), a viral infection, certain drugs or Meniere's disease. Neural hearingloss can result from infections, a brain tumour orother brain or nerve disorders, such as a stroke.In addition, the auditory nerve can be damagedat an early age by childhood diseases, includingmumps and rubella (German measles), as well as severe inner ear infections and meningitis. Presbycusis The major cause of sensorineural hearing loss,however, is presbycusis, or age-related \"old man's hearing\". It is a commoncondition affecting as many as 40 per cent ofpeople over 65, and experts report that by age 80 almost everyone will suffer from some degreeof hearing loss. Presbycusis causes gradual, progressive, high frequency hearing loss that tends to affect bothears at the same time. Presbycusis usually beginsbetween the ages of 40 and 50 and becomesslowly and progressively worse over time. Itaffects men more frequently and severely thanwomen. The speed and extent of this progressionvaries from person to person. Presbycusis develops as the middle ear goes through the process of ageing. The eardrumslowly loses its elasticity and the joints of theossicular bones stiffen. This hampers the soundwaves being conveyed from the outer ear to thecochlea. However, it is the age-driven changes inthe inner ear that have more impact. A structurein the inner ear called the cochlea is vital to thehearing process. Tiny hairs in the cochlea areresponsible for detecting and transmitting soundsto the brain. Presbycusis occurs when these haircells fail to properly do their job. These hair cellsgradually deteriorate over time and become lesseffective, resulting in an inability to pick upcertain higher frequency sounds. As such, it iscommon for people with presbycusis to 'hear'speech but be unable to distinguish sounds incertain ranges (for example, consonants, such as's' and 't'). 24 5Effects of hearing loss The inability to hear and communicate effectively can have severe psychological effects on an elderly person. The person often feels frustrated, muddled and confused. Self-esteem can suffer, as lack ofhearing by an older individual is oftenmistaken for lack of understanding, oreven senility or Alzheimer's disease. Many elderly who can't hear properly tend to retreat from otherpeople. The end results can beisolation, loneliness anddepression, even if the person issurrounded by family and friends. Other potential dangers include the inability to hear instructions and, asa result, to act inappropriately (e.g.medication mistakes made as a result ofnot hearing the doctor or pharmacist'scomment); and physical hazards (e.g.not hearing approaching traffic when crossingthe street). Presbycusis has no symptoms except the inability to hear. Because hearing loss progresses slowly ,people often 'get used' to not hearing as well andautomatically compensatory tactics, like standingcloser during conversation or turning the radioup louder. In addition, many elderly individualsdismiss hearing loss as a 'something that happenswhen you get old'. They don't consider it amedical condition, assume nothing can be doneand even don't think it is worth mentioning. \"Older individuals are often unaware of, or underestimate, their hearing loss,\" explainsMargaret Cheesman, PhD, Asst. Professor ofAudiology at the National Centre for Audiology;University of Western Ontario. \"Many people simply will not accept that they have a hearing problem. And if hearing loss isnoticed, it is too often accepted by the person, as well as family members, as an inevitable partof growing old.\" Dr. Cheesman also identifies negative perceptions towards this problem. \"There is an unfortunatestigma associated with hearing loss that is hardto explain,\" she comments. \"After all, no onewould argue about the importance of havingtheir eyes checked regularly as they grow older.But we tend to ignore our hearing.\" Another unfortunate misconception is that nothing can be done about age related hearing loss. Because of these attitudes, it often falls to frontline health professionals, such as visiting nurses, home care professionals and others, to identify the warning signs of presbycusis and initiate intervention (see Table 1). If the health professional does identify warning signs, they should discuss the situation with the individual and family members, as well as notify the appropriate member of the health care team (e.g. specialist or family physician). The goal is to have the patient/client's hearing checked by a qualified professional. Thisprofessional will be able to determine the typeand extent of hearing loss using a number of tests, including an audiogram. The results of these tests will determine the management strategy . An individual with conductive hearing loss will be referred to a specialist for treatment. However,since sensorineural hearing loss, such aspresbycusis, is not reversible, the specialist mayrecommend strategies to compensate for the loss. Treatment strategies Simple strategies for lesser degrees of hearingloss involve simple communications technique,such as: T urning down or eliminating all background noise (radios, etc.) Getting the person's attention before speaking Facing the person when speaking. Speaking one at a time. Keeping your face in the light. Speaking slowly and clearly . In most cases of presbycusis and other forms of sensorineural hearing loss,however, the recommended managementstrategy centres on the use of a hearing aid.Recent Publications 1999. \"Family Physician's Perspectives on Ovarian Cancer.\" In Cancer Prevention and Contro l, Vol. 3, No. 1, p. 61-67.

This includes all senior centres, senior clubs,senior housing manor associations and otherorganizations that are involved with thewelfare of seniors. An example of this kind oforganization is the Gerontology Association.In the rural areas of the province the seniorscouncil area is the county . In the urban area ofNova Scotia, Halifax, Dartmouth and Sackvilleeach has a Seniors Council. The County ofHalifax also has a Seniors Council. 2. T wo seniors from each senior group (preferably the president or chairman and another officer) represent their senior group, attend the council meetings, and participate in the business of the council. The business of the council is tohear the concerns of the seniors, try to dealwith them at the council level if possible, but if not, to prepare resolutions to present tothe appropriate authority; this is the municipalgovernment if it is municipal concern or to theFederation of Senior Citizens and Pensionersof Nova Scotia if it is a provincial matter. The FSCPNS considers the resolution(s) and if appropriate refers it (them) to the ProvincialMinister through Senior Citizens' Secretariat,an arm of the Provincial Government dealing with seniors. 3. A purpose of the councils is to promote the general principles of the senior movement:support the dignity of seniors, their health,their welfare and their independence. 4. Councils, since they are composed of senior leaders, can present an example of structurefor conducting proper meetings and electionof officers, and generally teaching seniorsleadership skills by example and inworkshops. 5. Councils can bring together all the senior for area wide activities such as ecumenicalservices, dances, picnics, fairs and seniorgames. These activities can be cooperative in nature or perhaps competitive to promote a bit of enthusiasm and excitement. Lucy F . Riley January 16, 2002, Halifax 6 23\"Getting a break: The caregiver's point of view\", most caregivers receive breaks in ways many of us would not perceive as such. The studyindicated that caregivers defined respite as\"stolen moments\", temporary reprieves fromcaregiving tasks. This suggests that for manycaregivers, respite is minimal. Their days areconsumed by eternal vigilance where the carereceiver is constantly on their mind, whetherconcerning health issues, quality of life or co-ordination of services. Caregivers often feel guilty due to periodic and normal feelings ofanger and feel that they could be doing more. Attitudinal change within the health care system is fundamental to providing flexible, accessibleand appropriate services that provide familycaregivers with opportunities to get a break.Eligibility criteria for services that focus on the care receiver create barriers that prohibit caregivers access to services. If caregivers are part of theassessment for services, it would enable serviceproviders to identify and meet their needs. The study confirmed that family caregivers and care receivers are minimal users of thecommunity health system. Caregivers accessoutside services when the care receiver'scondition worsens and becomes more complex.Prior to this, the caregiver has been providingcare, on average, for about six years. The research also confirmed that we are a caring society with a strong sense of moral obligation and commitment to our most valued relationships. People will continue to choose to provide carethemselves, and the system needs to be organizedto support them. Caregivers are essential to thehealth care system and must be integrated aspartners. Providing opportunities for caregiversto get a \"stolen moment\" is a good place to start. References Lorna Hillman and Neena Chappell. (January2000).

These amplifiedsounds travel through the ear and betterstimulate the nerve cells in the cochlea, enabling the person to hear. Hearing aid design has progressed significantly in the last few years, and today's hearing aids are farremoved from the unattractive and evenrelatively inefficient devices of even a decade ago.For example, problems with whistling and withthe device amplifying background noise alongwith desired sounds they have been significantlyreduced. Newer digital hearing aids offer manybenefits, including: improved ease of listening,reduction of listening fatigue, minimizeddistortion and circuit noise and more. Newer products are also smaller and more cosmetically acceptable. There are five basic types of hearing aids, and the audiologist will recommend a specifictype based on the individual's condition, lifestyle, preferences and other factors. The most common styles used today are in-the- ear (ITE) and in-the-canal (ITC) hearing aids. In ITE devices, the amplifier electronics are builtright into the earmould. ITC hearing aids aresmaller than ITE devices and fit into the canalportion of the ear. Other styles include behind-the-ear (BTE) and body worn hearing aids, as well as completely-in- the-canal (CIC) devices, which are nearly invisible. If used properly , a modern hearing aid candramatically improve the hearing of most peoplewith age-related and similar forms of hearingloss. This can make a tremendous difference to the person's ability to communicate,independence and overall quality of life. Unfortunately many people with hearing loss who can benefit from the use of a hearing aid failto seek treatment. In this regard, front line healthprofessionals in a variety of disciplines can playan important role in raising awareness andproviding accurate education. World Congress of Gerontology Dr. Gloria Gutman, President of the Organizing Committee for the International Association onGerontology (IAG) 17th World Congress ofGerontology , welcomed over 4,000 delegates tothe World Congress in Vancouver, BC July 1-6.Against a backdrop of flags from the 62 membercountries of IAG, including the first Africancountry , South Africa, Dr. John Gray , Secretary of the Organizing Committee, introduced thedignitaries at the Opening Ceremonies. Dr. Pierre Soucie, the President of the Canadian Association on Gerontology , welcomed thedelegates to Canada on behalf of the CAG, the host society for the Congress. Other dignitaries provided welcoming remarks including a video greeting from the Honourable Alan Rock, Canada's Minister of Health. The Official Opening wasdeclared by the BC Minister of State forIntermediate, Long Term and Home Care, theHonourable Katherine Whittred. The OpeningReception concluded with a dazzling fireworksdisplay celebrating Canada Day . The Vancouver Convention and Exhibition Centre, with its spectacular architecture,provided excellent facilities for the delegatesfrom over 80 countries. Numbering 4,086 intotal, attendance was over four times the averageCAG conference and twice as large as the 1997World Congress that took place in Adelaide,Australia. The major complaint from delegateswas that they could not attend more than onesession at a time. With over 30 simultaneoussessions there were lots of choices. The size ofthe Book of Abstracts, with over 3,000 abstracts,illustrated the depth, diversity and scope of theprogram. In addition to free papers, posters andplenary presentations, the 113 invited symposia were very well attended. The topics and convenors with international reputations, were chosen bythe IAG Planning Committee that included theRegional Chairs (Europe, Asia/Oceana, NorthAmerica, Latin America and the Carribean), the current and past JAG President and theScientific Program Chair for the 2001 Congress, 22 7Dr. Andrew Wister. Andrew is to be congratulated for this and all other aspects of the program. A feature of the 17th World Congress was the Continuing Medical Education program. Thesesessions, organized primarily by Dr. Lynn Beattie,were attended by many non-physicians as well. Audio tapes and some video tapes were made of the plenary sessions, selected invited symposiaand continuing medical education sessions.Tapes of the 80 sessions that were recorded canstill be purchased from Kennedy Recordings at: www.kennedyrecordings.com/conf/gerontology .htm Older Workers Viewed Negatively Young Canadian workers appear to hold a dim opinion of their older colleagues, a newlyreleased government poll reveals. The Ipsos-Reid poll, conducted for Human Resources Development Canada (HRDC) earlierthis year, suggests that only one-third of allCanadians believe most older workers haveattained higher education, and that opinion isstrongest among young workers. Recent statistics obtained from HRDC show about half of workers 55 to 64 years old haveobtained post-secondary education, particularlyat university or college, compared to 70 per centof the youngest workers However, only 27 per cent of those polled between ages 18 and 34 thought most olderworkers had higher education compared to 42per cent of 55-plus Canadians. Mike Colledge, senior vice-president of Ipsos- Reid, said the poll reveals a disconnect in theCanadian population about today's workforce. \"I would imagine that a little bit of self-interest comes into play . There is a little bit of ageneration gap,\" said Colledge. The gap is particularly noticeable on the question of retaining older workers. Respondents weresplit on the matter, with 51 per cent saying theybelieved in making room for the younger generation while 48 per cent thought olderworkers should be kept employed Colledge said it is not surprising that the youngest Canadians, between 18 and 34 yearsold, were the least likely to value older workers,as two-thirds favoured them getting out the wayfor younger workers. A majority of olderCanadians believed older workers are a valuableasset worth keeping around. A bare majority (51 per cent) of those polled agreed that older workers should be encouragedto remain in the labour force. While only 42 percent of 18- to 34-year-olds agreed, the numberjumped to 58 per cent for those over 55. A recent C.D. Howe Institute report stated that because of declining birth rates in Canada, theUnited States and Britain, growth in the workingage population will slow and ultimately cease by2030. That is expected to lead to a dramaticincrease in the average age and wages of theworkforce. With the country potentially poised on the edge of a recession, the poll found that two out ofthree Canadians believed older workers are morelikely to be laid off in hard times. This belief isheld most strongly by the older segment of thepopulation. The telephone survey of 1,000 Canadians conducted between March 20 and 25 isconsidered to accurately represent the opinionsof the Country as a whole within 3.1 percentagepoints, 19 times out of 20.

Bonne Hillman, Executive Director Family Caregivers' Network Society, Victoria When family caregivers are asked what they need to carry out their caregiving responsibilities, mostoften the response is easy access to informationand an opportunity to get a break once in awhile.Getting a break or respite means different thingsto different caregivers. What does respite mean to you? The term \"respite\" means a pause or rest from a continuous responsibility or activity and its goalis to enable caregivers to continue with their responsibilities by preventing stress and burn-out.

How does one become a caregiver. A family member becomes ill and you become a caregiver. You take on thejob without training, without pay and oftenwithout support. The job can last weeks, monthsor years. For me it was 15 years. You live inisolation, lose friends, have little or no social life, ongoing stress becomes a intricate part of your life and if you let care giving become all consumingyou can loose your identity . Thousands of Nova Scotians selflessly provide care for family or friends who are mentally or physically challenged,chronically ill, frail or elderly . By providing care at home these caregivers collectively provide an urgently needed servicesaving taxpayers millions of dollars. With an increase number of seniors requiring assistance at home, primary caregivers are avaluable link in the health chain and they needsupport. If you neglect the caregiver you will end up with two people who are ill and that becomes a strainon the health care system. The long hours of emotionally demanding work seems poorly understood and grossly undervalued. Maxine BarrettAdmission to Nursing Homes The Valley Caregivers' Support Group has been in existence for seven years, in part to helpmembers cope with the sometimes unbearablestress of caregiving. A major source of this stressfor a number of caregivers arises with thedecision to place a family member in a nursinghome. This decision is usually deferred until wellbeyond the limit of endurance and when thecaregiver and the family member are in a highlyvulnerable position. That is the moment whenthe family must face the cold hard facts aboutadmission to a nursing home facility .The impactof this decision can be overwhelming. The group, therefore, decided to inquire into the admission policies of other provinces andterritories as well as Nova Scotia. We approachedDalhousie University and Assistant ProfessorRobin Stadnyk of the School of OccupationalTherapy undertook to do the research. Theproject has been expanded to study the impact ofthe different funding models on families and themember being placed. Nova Scotia Policies and Practices Effective April, 2001, all applicants for admissionto any licensed nursing home in this provincemust go through a \"single entry access\"procedure, whether or not they pay the full cost of care. It involves complete disclosure of all income and assets of the applicant, as well as thespouse. Any transfer of property or money to athird party , even a child, within the three yearspreceding the application, must be disclosed. Income includes private pensions, Canada Pension, Old Age Security , Guaranteed Supplement, income arising from annuities and any otherregularly recurring income. Assets include the content of all bank accounts, any property ,(excluding the designated residence), RRSPS,GICs, shares, life insurance, boats and any otherfixed or liquid asset. 20 9The Government wants total disclosure of your financial affairs with no guarantee ofconfidentiality . This is to ensure that citizens will fully fund the cost of care in any nursinghome to the utmost extent of their ability . For the private payers this does not includemedicines, wheel chairs, ambulance fees andnumerous other items. Before any government support is extended, all eligible income and assets, with the exception ofthe designated residence, much be applied to thecost of care. For married couples, the combinedincome and assets, excluding the home, areeligible and half of their value must be applied tothe cost of care. The impact of such costs on thespouse remaining at home whose income isdrastically reduced but whose expenses remainrelatively unchanged, is devastating. This procedure entails the most drastic means testing any citizen will encounter and throughoutthe process there is no one to advice and directthe caregiver, who finds herself intimidated andhumiliated. An exhausted, quilt ridden,emotionally drained and often failing healthcaregiver is demoralized by the outcome. You can rent or sell your designated home but all net proceeds must be applied to your care , if the title of your home is still in your name. Spouses,can rent or sell the designated home but half ofthe income must be applied to the cost of care . They can transfer the home to another person, aslong as they do not receive value for it . And since the title is in someone else's name they can sell the house and the money belongs to them . Your have worked hard to acquire your designated home but if you sell it for any reasonthe government can lay claim to the proceedswith the stroke of a pen. What happened to yourdream of leaving a little of your inheritance toyour children? Rates are steadily increasing in nursing homes and some residents have been warned that \"allnursing homes will be directly impacted bylabour negotiations with Nurses in Nova Scotia.\" Evidence that nursing homes may have a different rates for residents who are fully fundingtheir care is indicated in a Department of Healthinformation document, Nursing Homes/Homes for the Aged: General Information , Department of Health, March 2001, page 5. Are private payingpatients subsidizing Government funded care? For years caregivers have been trying to shed the name informal caregiver but it is still being usedby the Department of Health in their single entryaccess brochure. There is nothing informal aboutthe 80% care we give day in and day out,sometimes for many years. If they really want tolabel us it should be the unpaid caregiver. Policies of other Canadian Provinces and Territories Families in the Maritime provinces are expected to contribute to the full cost of care and will bemeans tested for both income and assets asdescribed above for Nova Scotia. In Newfoundland, the same policy direction exists as in the Maritimes up to a maximumcurrently set at $2900 per month. In Nova Scotiathe cost can exceed $4500 per month. Thatbrings the yearly cost for Nursing Home care toover $50,000. In Alberta and the Territories residents are not means tested. All person pay an affordable price. In contrast to the Atlantic provinces, other jurisdictions focus on recovering only the room and board portion and means testing and only doneand income . The nursing care component is paid for by the province. This is in keeping with theprinciple of universality in health care of whichCanadians boast. Why are senior citizens in theAtlantic provinces being discriminated against?Federal equalization grants are intended toensure equal health and social services among allprovinces. As citizens we are entitle to the sametreatment that exists in many other provinces,that is, paying for room and board and being means tested on just our income . What a statement these policy directions make about the value thatMaritime provinces place on a caregiver'scontribution. New Drug Could Prevent Diabetes Preliminary research suggests that a new drug could stop he progression of type 1 diabetes byhalting the destruction of insulin-producing cells. Experts say that as well as stopping deterioration in people in the early stages of the disease, thedrug eventually could also be given to pre-diabetics to prevent the illness, an incurableautoimmune disease that afflicts about 15 millionpeople worldwide. \"Right now this is probably the most exciting thing we have in front of us,\" said Dr. JerryPalmer, a professor of medicine at the Universityof Washington in Seattle who was not connectedto the study . He called the results \"tantalizing.\" In type I diabetes, the immune system goes awry and kills insulin-producing beta cells in thepancreas. It occurs mostly in children andadolescents, but is increasingly being seen inadults. In type 1 diabetes, which accounts for 90percent of diabetes and is not an autoimmunecondition, the beta cells are intact but the bodydoesn't use insulin properly . Scientists believe that type I diabetes may be triggered by an infection or other irritant thatputs the insulin-producing cells under stress. The cells secrete a stress chemical, attracting immune system cells patrolling the body . Theimmune cells mistake the stressed beta cells as foreign invaders and release a poison to kill them. The experimental drug, developed by Israelipharmaceutical company Peptor Ltd., contains asubstance that prompts the immune cells torelease a harmless anti-inflammatory chemicalmeant to calm inflamed natural tissue instead of a deadly poison meant for an unwelcome stranger. Similar approaches are being pursued for otherautoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoidarthritis.\"This is the first study to show that you can stop beta cell destruction by outside immunization,\"said one of the investigators, Dr. Itamar Raz,head of the Hadassah Center for Diabetes atHadassah-Hebrew University Medical School inJerusalem. \"We do know today for the first timethat by giving a small amount of antigen we canchange the whole characteristic of the immunesystem and stop that attack. The study , published in The Lancet medical journal, involved 31 men who had beendiagnosed with type I diabetes within theprevious six months. They all got the insulin injections they needed, but in addition, 15 got the drug, DiaPep277, and16 got a fake injection. The injections were givenon the first day of the study , after one month andafter six months. They were followed for fourmore months. \"At the beginning of the study , we think that they had 3 to 7 percent of their beta cells left,\" Razsaid. \"At the end of the study , those on placebohad less than 1 percent of their beta cells left. Those on the drug had the same\u20143 to 7 percent.\" By the end, those who were on the drug hardlyneeded outside insulin, while those on placeboneeded an increasing amount as time passed, the study found.

After 18 months, 53 percent of the non-exercise group reported they had lost some or all abilityto transfer from a bed to a chair, bathe, use thetoilet or dress. In comparison, about 37 percentof exercisers did, and the difference betweenwalking and weight training was so slight thatresearchers considered the benefits alike. \"I definitely think that people with knee osteoarthritis would benefit from a resistance oraerobic program,\" Penninx said. \"What thisstudy shows is that exercise is beneficial.\" And the anti-disability benefits may extend beyond the knee, because 75 percent of the study participants had arthritis elsewhere, Penninx said. Previous studies have found that exercise reducespain and improves muscle tone, balance and theability to do things such as walk, but this is thefirst to go to the next level and examineprevention of disability . The study gives a stronger oundation to current medical support for exercise. \"I can't think of anybody I wouldn't put on an individual exercise program,\" said Dr. RolandMoscowitz, a medical professor at Case WesternUniversity . Walking on a treadmill almost alwayshelps, and weight training can help too, providedthe person in charge of training knows how toavoid damaging a patient's joints, he said. Exercise probably is best for people in early stages, before development of joint deformity ,extensive cartilage loss and continuing pain, saidDr. Marian Minor of the University of Missouri. \"I'm trying to make a case for prescription of exercise early\u2014not thinking you are going torescue people later,\" said Minor, a researcher whowas not connected with the Wake Forest study .

All this is about to change. More than seven years in development, the new World Health Organization (WHO) classificationsystem has been accepted by 191 countries as theinternational standard to describe and measurehealth and disability . It is applicable acrosscultures, age groups and genders. Hence it willsoon be possible to reliably compare data onhealth outcomes of individuals and populations. Released in mid-November, the International Classification of Functioning, Disability andHealth (ICF) changes understanding of disability .No longer is it presented as a problem of aminority group. According to the WHO, \"the ICF takes into account the social aspects of disability andprovides a mechanism to document the impact of the social and physical environment on aperson's functioning. For instance, when a personwith a serious disability finds it difficult to workin a particular building because it does notprovide ramps or elevators, the ICF identifies the needed focus of an intervention, i.e. that thebuilding should include those facilities and notthat the person be forced out of the job becauseof an inability to work.\" The ICF puts all disease and health conditions on an equal footing.

How to give your house and keep it There are two examples in Canada of Houses donated by individuals. We say\"individuals\" because there are manyexamples of donations or nominallypriced leases by churches. To put this in simple terms, it is like the member of the oldestprofession who was heard to say:\"You got it ... you sell it ... and youstill got it. What a business!\" A spectacular Oak Bay heritage house designed by the architect Samuel Maclurein his trademark Scottish Baronial stylebecame an Abbeyfield through the generosity ofCount Albert De Mezey , a retired engineer. Ten years ago, Count De Mezey announced in a newspaper article that he wanted to find someuse for the house that involved seniors. Needlessto say , a number of groups approached him, butAnne Spicer, President of the Abbeyfield Chapter,was able to persuade him to give the house toAbbeyfield. A condition of his gift was that hestay in the house rent-free. This commitment hasbeen honoured, and on November 12 hecelebrated his 98th birthday . Through the yearsDorothy Youlden and her committee have facedthe daunting task of raising money forrenovations and repairs, keeping the house at avery high standard. A recent example of an individual's generosity is in Armstrong, BC. Mr. Peter Unrau gave hishouse with the condition that he live rent-freeand have al1 his living expenses covered. He alsoinsisted on keeping his dog and his pool table. In this, case the house had to undergo extensiverenovations and expansion at the back. CityAdministrator Patti Ferguson and her committeehave produced a most attractive residence withdeluxe accommodation upstairs for the HouseManager. What is interesting about thisconversion is that for only three months did Mr. Unrau have to leave the house, which isaffectionately referred to as \"Pete's Place.\" There are many people whose houses have outgrown their needs, yet who do not want tolive anywhere else. They find that the effort andexpense of upkeep are more than they want to orare able to handle. This model allows the personto continue living in the family home whilebenefiting others. The conversion process caninclude close cooperation with the Abbeyfieldcommittee in design and building, and allowshim or her to have first choice of a suite in therenovated house.

In addition, nurse researchers found that prayer is the most frequently reported alternativetreatment used by seniors to feel better ormaintain health in general. The study , published in the December issue of the Journal of Holistic Nursing,found that prayer isused more often thanother alternativetherapies, spiritualstrategies to feel good or maintain their health aswell. Prayer, imagery , music, art therapy ,distraction, energy healing, humour, meditation,relaxation and religious counselling were definedas spiritual treatments. The results of this study illustrate that prayer may help seniors decrease the negative effects of stress in their lives. It also proves useful forfurther assessment of prayer as a coping andtreatment approach.

What impact are caregivers having on the Canadian health care system? According toStatistics Canada (1996 GSS Social Survey), over2.8 million Canadians, 15 years of age and older,provided care to people with physical limitationsor long term health problems. The economicvalue of caregivers is enormous\u2014help given toseniors alone saves the public system over 5billion dollars per year and is equivalent to thework of 276,509 full-time employees.

Those who regularly walked or did weight training were less likely to lose abilities toperform activities of daily living, such as getting out of bed, the study says. The report is the first to demonstrate that exercise can help people avoid relying on others for helpin these ordinary activities, said researcherBrenda Penninx of the Wake Forest UniversitySchool of Medicine. Penninx and her colleagues looked at 250 participants ages 60 and older. When the studystarted, all could perform normal activities,despite osteoarthritis of the knee. Osteoarthritisis characterized by progressive deterioration ofcartilage, and affects more than 80 percent ofthose who reach the age of 70. The participants were divided into three groups. One walked for 40 minutes three times a week. Another spent the same amount of time on weight training\u2014two sets of 12 repetitions of nine exercises, most of them for the legs. The third did no exercise and served as a comparison group. 12 17Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada, the Canadian Breast Cancer Network and the National Advisory Council on Aging, among others.

Amazing Computer Memory Research A team of Halifax scientists is developing a portable computer \"cane for the brain\" to propup the fading memory of Alzheimer patients. The device dubbed My Story will be programmed to help people with the disease recognize friendsand relatives. Doctors and computer scientists even want the handheld computers to be able to do everythingfrom showing lost Alzheimer's patients the way home to reminding them when to buy more milk. \"The computer could beep at you or let youknow that now is the time to feed the cat or nowis the time to take your pills.\" said KennethRockwood, a geriatric medicine specialist at theQEII Health Sciences Centre.

Amazing Computer Memory Research A team of Halifax scientists is developing a portable computer \"cane for the brain\" to propup the fading memory of Alzheimer patients. The device dubbed My Story will be programmed to help people with the disease recognize friendsand relatives.

In addition, nurse researchers found that prayer is the most frequently reported alternativetreatment used by seniors to feel better ormaintain health in general. The study , published in the December issue of the Journal of Holistic Nursing,found that prayer isused more often thanother alternativetherapies, spiritualstrategies to feel good or maintain their health aswell. Prayer, imagery , music, art therapy ,distraction, energy healing, humour, meditation,relaxation and religious counselling were definedas spiritual treatments. The results of this study illustrate that prayer may help seniors decrease the negative effects of stress in their lives. It also proves useful forfurther assessment of prayer as a coping andtreatment approach.

The Coalition is committed to creating a voice for caregiverswithin the Canadian context of care andprioritizing caregiving issues in health carepolicy , education and program development. The Coalition will highlight advocacy as a timely and crucial need for caregivers who often do nothave anyone to speak on their behalf. It aims tofulfill its mission through consultation andadvocacy , by promoting relevant research and bynetworking between organizations, groups andindividuals to share information and to promotepartnerships. It publishes a bilingual newsletter, in French and English, two times a year.

What impact are caregivers having on the Canadian health care system? According toStatistics Canada (1996 GSS Social Survey), over2.8 million Canadians, 15 years of age and older,provided care to people with physical limitationsor long term health problems. The economicvalue of caregivers is enormous\u2014help given toseniors alone saves the public system over 5billion dollars per year and is equivalent to thework of 276,509 full-time employees.

Those who regularly walked or did weight training were less likely to lose abilities toperform activities of daily living, such as getting out of bed, the study says. The report is the first to demonstrate that exercise can help people avoid relying on others for helpin these ordinary activities, said researcherBrenda Penninx of the Wake Forest UniversitySchool of Medicine. Penninx and her colleagues looked at 250 participants ages 60 and older. When the studystarted, all could perform normal activities,despite osteoarthritis of the knee. Osteoarthritisis characterized by progressive deterioration ofcartilage, and affects more than 80 percent ofthose who reach the age of 70. The participants were divided into three groups. One walked for 40 minutes three times a week. Another spent the same amount of time on weight training\u2014two sets of 12 repetitions of nine exercises, most of them for the legs. The third did no exercise and served as a comparison group. 12 17Results of the study were published in the Oct. 22 issue of Archives of Internal Medicine . After 18 months, 53 percent of the non-exercise group reported they had lost some or all abilityto transfer from a bed to a chair, bathe, use thetoilet or dress. In comparison, about 37 percentof exercisers did, and the difference betweenwalking and weight training was so slight thatresearchers considered the benefits alike. \"I definitely think that people with knee osteoarthritis would benefit from a resistance oraerobic program,\" Penninx said. \"What thisstudy shows is that exercise is beneficial.\" And the anti-disability benefits may extend beyond the knee, because 75 percent of the study participants had arthritis elsewhere, Penninx said. Previous studies have found that exercise reducespain and improves muscle tone, balance and theability to do things such as walk, but this is thefirst to go to the next level and examineprevention of disability . The study gives a stronger oundation to current medical support for exercise. \"I can't think of anybody I wouldn't put on an individual exercise program,\" said Dr. RolandMoscowitz, a medical professor at Case WesternUniversity . Walking on a treadmill almost alwayshelps, and weight training can help too, providedthe person in charge of training knows how toavoid damaging a patient's joints, he said. Exercise probably is best for people in early stages, before development of joint deformity ,extensive cartilage loss and continuing pain, saidDr. Marian Minor of the University of Missouri. \"I'm trying to make a case for prescription of exercise early\u2014not thinking you are going torescue people later,\" said Minor, a researcher whowas not connected with the Wake Forest study .

All this is about to change. More than seven years in development, the new World Health Organization (WHO) classificationsystem has been accepted by 191 countries as theinternational standard to describe and measurehealth and disability . It is applicable acrosscultures, age groups and genders. Hence it willsoon be possible to reliably compare data onhealth outcomes of individuals and populations. Released in mid-November, the International Classification of Functioning, Disability andHealth (ICF) changes understanding of disability .No longer is it presented as a problem of aminority group. According to the WHO, \"the ICF takes into account the social aspects of disability andprovides a mechanism to document the impact of the social and physical environment on aperson's functioning. For instance, when a personwith a serious disability finds it difficult to workin a particular building because it does notprovide ramps or elevators, the ICF identifies the needed focus of an intervention, i.e. that thebuilding should include those facilities and notthat the person be forced out of the job becauseof an inability to work.\" The ICF puts all disease and health conditions on an equal footing.

How to give your house and keep it There are two examples in Canada of Houses donated by individuals. We say\"individuals\" because there are manyexamples of donations or nominallypriced leases by churches. To put this in simple terms, it is like the member of the oldestprofession who was heard to say:\"You got it ... you sell it ... and youstill got it. What a business!\" A spectacular Oak Bay heritage house designed by the architect Samuel Maclurein his trademark Scottish Baronial stylebecame an Abbeyfield through the generosity ofCount Albert De Mezey , a retired engineer. Ten years ago, Count De Mezey announced in a newspaper article that he wanted to find someuse for the house that involved seniors. Needlessto say , a number of groups approached him, butAnne Spicer, President of the Abbeyfield Chapter,was able to persuade him to give the house toAbbeyfield. A condition of his gift was that hestay in the house rent-free. This commitment hasbeen honoured, and on November 12 hecelebrated his 98th birthday . Through the yearsDorothy Youlden and her committee have facedthe daunting task of raising money forrenovations and repairs, keeping the house at avery high standard. A recent example of an individual's generosity is in Armstrong, BC. Mr. Peter Unrau gave hishouse with the condition that he live rent-freeand have al1 his living expenses covered. He alsoinsisted on keeping his dog and his pool table. In this, case the house had to undergo extensiverenovations and expansion at the back. CityAdministrator Patti Ferguson and her committeehave produced a most attractive residence withdeluxe accommodation upstairs for the HouseManager. What is interesting about thisconversion is that for only three months did Mr. Unrau have to leave the house, which isaffectionately referred to as \"Pete's Place.\" There are many people whose houses have outgrown their needs, yet who do not want tolive anywhere else. They find that the effort andexpense of upkeep are more than they want to orare able to handle. This model allows the personto continue living in the family home whilebenefiting others. The conversion process caninclude close cooperation with the Abbeyfieldcommittee in design and building, and allowshim or her to have first choice of a suite in therenovated house.

This is to ensure that citizens will fully fund the cost of care in any nursinghome to the utmost extent of their ability . For the private payers this does not includemedicines, wheel chairs, ambulance fees andnumerous other items. Before any government support is extended, all eligible income and assets, with the exception ofthe designated residence, much be applied to thecost of care. For married couples, the combinedincome and assets, excluding the home, areeligible and half of their value must be applied tothe cost of care. The impact of such costs on thespouse remaining at home whose income isdrastically reduced but whose expenses remainrelatively unchanged, is devastating. This procedure entails the most drastic means testing any citizen will encounter and throughoutthe process there is no one to advice and directthe caregiver, who finds herself intimidated andhumiliated. An exhausted, quilt ridden,emotionally drained and often failing healthcaregiver is demoralized by the outcome. You can rent or sell your designated home but all net proceeds must be applied to your care , if the title of your home is still in your name. Spouses,can rent or sell the designated home but half ofthe income must be applied to the cost of care . They can transfer the home to another person, aslong as they do not receive value for it . And since the title is in someone else's name they can sell the house and the money belongs to them . Your have worked hard to acquire your designated home but if you sell it for any reasonthe government can lay claim to the proceedswith the stroke of a pen. What happened to yourdream of leaving a little of your inheritance toyour children? Rates are steadily increasing in nursing homes and some residents have been warned that \"allnursing homes will be directly impacted bylabour negotiations with Nurses in Nova Scotia.\" Evidence that nursing homes may have a different rates for residents who are fully fundingtheir care is indicated in a Department of Healthinformation document, Nursing Homes/Homes for the Aged: General Information , Department of Health, March 2001, page 5. Are private payingpatients subsidizing Government funded care? For years caregivers have been trying to shed the name informal caregiver but it is still being usedby the Department of Health in their single entryaccess brochure. There is nothing informal aboutthe 80% care we give day in and day out,sometimes for many years. If they really want tolabel us it should be the unpaid caregiver. Policies of other Canadian Provinces and Territories Families in the Maritime provinces are expected to contribute to the full cost of care and will bemeans tested for both income and assets asdescribed above for Nova Scotia. In Newfoundland, the same policy direction exists as in the Maritimes up to a maximumcurrently set at $2900 per month. In Nova Scotiathe cost can exceed $4500 per month. Thatbrings the yearly cost for Nursing Home care toover $50,000. In Alberta and the Territories residents are not means tested. All person pay an affordable price. In contrast to the Atlantic provinces, other jurisdictions focus on recovering only the room and board portion and means testing and only doneand income . The nursing care component is paid for by the province. This is in keeping with theprinciple of universality in health care of whichCanadians boast. Why are senior citizens in theAtlantic provinces being discriminated against?Federal equalization grants are intended toensure equal health and social services among allprovinces. As citizens we are entitle to the sametreatment that exists in many other provinces,that is, paying for room and board and being means tested on just our income . What a statement these policy directions make about the value thatMaritime provinces place on a caregiver'scontribution. New Drug Could Prevent Diabetes Preliminary research suggests that a new drug could stop he progression of type 1 diabetes byhalting the destruction of insulin-producing cells. Experts say that as well as stopping deterioration in people in the early stages of the disease, thedrug eventually could also be given to pre-diabetics to prevent the illness, an incurableautoimmune disease that afflicts about 15 millionpeople worldwide. \"Right now this is probably the most exciting thing we have in front of us,\" said Dr. JerryPalmer, a professor of medicine at the Universityof Washington in Seattle who was not connectedto the study . He called the results \"tantalizing.\" In type I diabetes, the immune system goes awry and kills insulin-producing beta cells in thepancreas. It occurs mostly in children andadolescents, but is increasingly being seen inadults. In type 1 diabetes, which accounts for 90percent of diabetes and is not an autoimmunecondition, the beta cells are intact but the bodydoesn't use insulin properly . Scientists believe that type I diabetes may be triggered by an infection or other irritant thatputs the insulin-producing cells under stress. The cells secrete a stress chemical, attracting immune system cells patrolling the body . Theimmune cells mistake the stressed beta cells as foreign invaders and release a poison to kill them. The experimental drug, developed by Israelipharmaceutical company Peptor Ltd., contains asubstance that prompts the immune cells torelease a harmless anti-inflammatory chemicalmeant to calm inflamed natural tissue instead of a deadly poison meant for an unwelcome stranger. Similar approaches are being pursued for otherautoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoidarthritis.\"This is the first study to show that you can stop beta cell destruction by outside immunization,\"said one of the investigators, Dr. Itamar Raz,head of the Hadassah Center for Diabetes atHadassah-Hebrew University Medical School inJerusalem. \"We do know today for the first timethat by giving a small amount of antigen we canchange the whole characteristic of the immunesystem and stop that attack. The study , published in The Lancet medical journal, involved 31 men who had beendiagnosed with type I diabetes within theprevious six months. They all got the insulin injections they needed, but in addition, 15 got the drug, DiaPep277, and16 got a fake injection. The injections were givenon the first day of the study , after one month andafter six months. They were followed for fourmore months. \"At the beginning of the study , we think that they had 3 to 7 percent of their beta cells left,\" Razsaid. \"At the end of the study , those on placebohad less than 1 percent of their beta cells left. Those on the drug had the same\u20143 to 7 percent.\" By the end, those who were on the drug hardlyneeded outside insulin, while those on placeboneeded an increasing amount as time passed, the study found.

How does one become a caregiver. A family member becomes ill and you become a caregiver. You take on thejob without training, without pay and oftenwithout support. The job can last weeks, monthsor years. For me it was 15 years. You live inisolation, lose friends, have little or no social life, ongoing stress becomes a intricate part of your life and if you let care giving become all consumingyou can loose your identity . Thousands of Nova Scotians selflessly provide care for family or friends who are mentally or physically challenged,chronically ill, frail or elderly . By providing care at home these caregivers collectively provide an urgently needed servicesaving taxpayers millions of dollars. With an increase number of seniors requiring assistance at home, primary caregivers are avaluable link in the health chain and they needsupport. If you neglect the caregiver you will end up with two people who are ill and that becomes a strainon the health care system. The long hours of emotionally demanding work seems poorly understood and grossly undervalued. Maxine BarrettAdmission to Nursing Homes The Valley Caregivers' Support Group has been in existence for seven years, in part to helpmembers cope with the sometimes unbearablestress of caregiving. A major source of this stressfor a number of caregivers arises with thedecision to place a family member in a nursinghome. This decision is usually deferred until wellbeyond the limit of endurance and when thecaregiver and the family member are in a highlyvulnerable position. That is the moment whenthe family must face the cold hard facts aboutadmission to a nursing home facility .The impactof this decision can be overwhelming. The group, therefore, decided to inquire into the admission policies of other provinces andterritories as well as Nova Scotia. We approachedDalhousie University and Assistant ProfessorRobin Stadnyk of the School of OccupationalTherapy undertook to do the research. Theproject has been expanded to study the impact ofthe different funding models on families and themember being placed. Nova Scotia Policies and Practices Effective April, 2001, all applicants for admissionto any licensed nursing home in this provincemust go through a \"single entry access\"procedure, whether or not they pay the full cost of care. It involves complete disclosure of all income and assets of the applicant, as well as thespouse. Any transfer of property or money to athird party , even a child, within the three yearspreceding the application, must be disclosed. Income includes private pensions, Canada Pension, Old Age Security , Guaranteed Supplement, income arising from annuities and any otherregularly recurring income. Assets include the content of all bank accounts, any property ,(excluding the designated residence), RRSPS,GICs, shares, life insurance, boats and any otherfixed or liquid asset. 20 9Dr. Andrew Wister. Andrew is to be congratulated for this and all other aspects of the program. A feature of the 17th World Congress was the Continuing Medical Education program. Thesesessions, organized primarily by Dr. Lynn Beattie,were attended by many non-physicians as well. Audio tapes and some video tapes were made of the plenary sessions, selected invited symposiaand continuing medical education sessions.Tapes of the 80 sessions that were recorded canstill be purchased from Kennedy Recordings at: www.kennedyrecordings.com/conf/gerontology .htm Older Workers Viewed Negatively Young Canadian workers appear to hold a dim opinion of their older colleagues, a newlyreleased government poll reveals. The Ipsos-Reid poll, conducted for Human Resources Development Canada (HRDC) earlierthis year, suggests that only one-third of allCanadians believe most older workers haveattained higher education, and that opinion isstrongest among young workers. Recent statistics obtained from HRDC show about half of workers 55 to 64 years old haveobtained post-secondary education, particularlyat university or college, compared to 70 per centof the youngest workers However, only 27 per cent of those polled between ages 18 and 34 thought most olderworkers had higher education compared to 42per cent of 55-plus Canadians. Mike Colledge, senior vice-president of Ipsos- Reid, said the poll reveals a disconnect in theCanadian population about today's workforce. \"I would imagine that a little bit of self-interest comes into play . There is a little bit of ageneration gap,\" said Colledge. The gap is particularly noticeable on the question of retaining older workers. Respondents weresplit on the matter, with 51 per cent saying theybelieved in making room for the younger generation while 48 per cent thought olderworkers should be kept employed Colledge said it is not surprising that the youngest Canadians, between 18 and 34 yearsold, were the least likely to value older workers,as two-thirds favoured them getting out the wayfor younger workers. A majority of olderCanadians believed older workers are a valuableasset worth keeping around. A bare majority (51 per cent) of those polled agreed that older workers should be encouragedto remain in the labour force. While only 42 percent of 18- to 34-year-olds agreed, the numberjumped to 58 per cent for those over 55. A recent C.D. Howe Institute report stated that because of declining birth rates in Canada, theUnited States and Britain, growth in the workingage population will slow and ultimately cease by2030. That is expected to lead to a dramaticincrease in the average age and wages of theworkforce. With the country potentially poised on the edge of a recession, the poll found that two out ofthree Canadians believed older workers are morelikely to be laid off in hard times. This belief isheld most strongly by the older segment of thepopulation. The telephone survey of 1,000 Canadians conducted between March 20 and 25 isconsidered to accurately represent the opinionsof the Country as a whole within 3.1 percentagepoints, 19 times out of 20.

Bonne Hillman, Executive Director Family Caregivers' Network Society, Victoria When family caregivers are asked what they need to carry out their caregiving responsibilities, mostoften the response is easy access to informationand an opportunity to get a break once in awhile.Getting a break or respite means different thingsto different caregivers. What does respite mean to you? The term \"respite\" means a pause or rest from a continuous responsibility or activity and its goalis to enable caregivers to continue with their responsibilities by preventing stress and burn-out. According to a research study conducted by Dr. Neena Chappell and Dr. Elizabeth Dow , 8 21\"Getting a break: The caregiver's point of view\", most caregivers receive breaks in ways many of us would not perceive as such. The studyindicated that caregivers defined respite as\"stolen moments\", temporary reprieves fromcaregiving tasks. This suggests that for manycaregivers, respite is minimal. Their days areconsumed by eternal vigilance where the carereceiver is constantly on their mind, whetherconcerning health issues, quality of life or co-ordination of services. Caregivers often feel guilty due to periodic and normal feelings ofanger and feel that they could be doing more. Attitudinal change within the health care system is fundamental to providing flexible, accessibleand appropriate services that provide familycaregivers with opportunities to get a break.Eligibility criteria for services that focus on the care receiver create barriers that prohibit caregivers access to services. If caregivers are part of theassessment for services, it would enable serviceproviders to identify and meet their needs. The study confirmed that family caregivers and care receivers are minimal users of thecommunity health system. Caregivers accessoutside services when the care receiver'scondition worsens and becomes more complex.Prior to this, the caregiver has been providingcare, on average, for about six years. The research also confirmed that we are a caring society with a strong sense of moral obligation and commitment to our most valued relationships. People will continue to choose to provide carethemselves, and the system needs to be organizedto support them. Caregivers are essential to thehealth care system and must be integrated aspartners. Providing opportunities for caregiversto get a \"stolen moment\" is a good place to start. References Lorna Hillman and Neena Chappell. (January2000).

This program will determine the number of seniors living in the Cape Breton RegionalMunicipality who require or wish to havetelephone contact due to being isolated with no family or neighborly interaction.

These amplifiedsounds travel through the ear and betterstimulate the nerve cells in the cochlea, enabling the person to hear. Hearing aid design has progressed significantly in the last few years, and today's hearing aids are farremoved from the unattractive and evenrelatively inefficient devices of even a decade ago.For example, problems with whistling and withthe device amplifying background noise alongwith desired sounds they have been significantlyreduced. Newer digital hearing aids offer manybenefits, including: improved ease of listening,reduction of listening fatigue, minimizeddistortion and circuit noise and more. Newer products are also smaller and more cosmetically acceptable. There are five basic types of hearing aids, and the audiologist will recommend a specifictype based on the individual's condition, lifestyle, preferences and other factors. The most common styles used today are in-the- ear (ITE) and in-the-canal (ITC) hearing aids. In ITE devices, the amplifier electronics are builtright into the earmould. ITC hearing aids aresmaller than ITE devices and fit into the canalportion of the ear. Other styles include behind-the-ear (BTE) and body worn hearing aids, as well as completely-in- the-canal (CIC) devices, which are nearly invisible. If used properly , a modern hearing aid candramatically improve the hearing of most peoplewith age-related and similar forms of hearingloss. This can make a tremendous difference to the person's ability to communicate,independence and overall quality of life. Unfortunately many people with hearing loss who can benefit from the use of a hearing aid failto seek treatment. In this regard, front line healthprofessionals in a variety of disciplines can playan important role in raising awareness andproviding accurate education. World Congress of Gerontology Dr. Gloria Gutman, President of the Organizing Committee for the International Association onGerontology (IAG) 17th World Congress ofGerontology , welcomed over 4,000 delegates tothe World Congress in Vancouver, BC July 1-6.Against a backdrop of flags from the 62 membercountries of IAG, including the first Africancountry , South Africa, Dr. John Gray , Secretary of the Organizing Committee, introduced thedignitaries at the Opening Ceremonies. Dr. Pierre Soucie, the President of the Canadian Association on Gerontology , welcomed thedelegates to Canada on behalf of the CAG, the host society for the Congress. Other dignitaries provided welcoming remarks including a video greeting from the Honourable Alan Rock, Canada's Minister of Health. The Official Opening wasdeclared by the BC Minister of State forIntermediate, Long Term and Home Care, theHonourable Katherine Whittred. The OpeningReception concluded with a dazzling fireworksdisplay celebrating Canada Day . The Vancouver Convention and Exhibition Centre, with its spectacular architecture,provided excellent facilities for the delegatesfrom over 80 countries. Numbering 4,086 intotal, attendance was over four times the averageCAG conference and twice as large as the 1997World Congress that took place in Adelaide,Australia. The major complaint from delegateswas that they could not attend more than onesession at a time. With over 30 simultaneoussessions there were lots of choices. The size ofthe Book of Abstracts, with over 3,000 abstracts,illustrated the depth, diversity and scope of theprogram. In addition to free papers, posters andplenary presentations, the 113 invited symposia were very well attended. The topics and convenors with international reputations, were chosen bythe IAG Planning Committee that included theRegional Chairs (Europe, Asia/Oceana, NorthAmerica, Latin America and the Carribean), the current and past JAG President and theScientific Program Chair for the 2001 Congress, 22 7Effects of hearing loss The inability to hear and communicate effectively can have severe psychological effects on an elderly person. The person often feels frustrated, muddled and confused. Self-esteem can suffer, as lack ofhearing by an older individual is oftenmistaken for lack of understanding, oreven senility or Alzheimer's disease. Many elderly who can't hear properly tend to retreat from otherpeople. The end results can beisolation, loneliness anddepression, even if the person issurrounded by family and friends. Other potential dangers include the inability to hear instructions and, asa result, to act inappropriately (e.g.medication mistakes made as a result ofnot hearing the doctor or pharmacist'scomment); and physical hazards (e.g.not hearing approaching traffic when crossingthe street). Presbycusis has no symptoms except the inability to hear. Because hearing loss progresses slowly ,people often 'get used' to not hearing as well andautomatically compensatory tactics, like standingcloser during conversation or turning the radioup louder. In addition, many elderly individualsdismiss hearing loss as a 'something that happenswhen you get old'. They don't consider it amedical condition, assume nothing can be doneand even don't think it is worth mentioning. \"Older individuals are often unaware of, or underestimate, their hearing loss,\" explainsMargaret Cheesman, PhD, Asst. Professor ofAudiology at the National Centre for Audiology;University of Western Ontario. \"Many people simply will not accept that they have a hearing problem. And if hearing loss isnoticed, it is too often accepted by the person, as well as family members, as an inevitable partof growing old.\" Dr. Cheesman also identifies negative perceptions towards this problem. \"There is an unfortunatestigma associated with hearing loss that is hardto explain,\" she comments. \"After all, no onewould argue about the importance of havingtheir eyes checked regularly as they grow older.But we tend to ignore our hearing.\" Another unfortunate misconception is that nothing can be done about age related hearing loss. Because of these attitudes, it often falls to frontline health professionals, such as visiting nurses, home care professionals and others, to identify the warning signs of presbycusis and initiate intervention (see Table 1). If the health professional does identify warning signs, they should discuss the situation with the individual and family members, as well as notify the appropriate member of the health care team (e.g. specialist or family physician). The goal is to have the patient/client's hearing checked by a qualified professional. Thisprofessional will be able to determine the typeand extent of hearing loss using a number of tests, including an audiogram. The results of these tests will determine the management strategy . An individual with conductive hearing loss will be referred to a specialist for treatment. However,since sensorineural hearing loss, such aspresbycusis, is not reversible, the specialist mayrecommend strategies to compensate for the loss. Treatment strategies Simple strategies for lesser degrees of hearingloss involve simple communications technique,such as: T urning down or eliminating all background noise (radios, etc.) Getting the person's attention before speaking Facing the person when speaking. Speaking one at a time. Keeping your face in the light. Speaking slowly and clearly . In most cases of presbycusis and other forms of sensorineural hearing loss,however, the recommended managementstrategy centres on the use of a hearing aid.Recent Publications 1999. \"Family Physician's Perspectives on Ovarian Cancer.\" In Cancer Prevention and Contro l, Vol. 3, No. 1, p. 61-67.

This includes all senior centres, senior clubs,senior housing manor associations and otherorganizations that are involved with thewelfare of seniors. An example of this kind oforganization is the Gerontology Association.In the rural areas of the province the seniorscouncil area is the county . In the urban area ofNova Scotia, Halifax, Dartmouth and Sackvilleeach has a Seniors Council. The County ofHalifax also has a Seniors Council. 2. T wo seniors from each senior group (preferably the president or chairman and another officer) represent their senior group, attend the council meetings, and participate in the business of the council. The business of the council is tohear the concerns of the seniors, try to dealwith them at the council level if possible, but if not, to prepare resolutions to present tothe appropriate authority; this is the municipalgovernment if it is municipal concern or to theFederation of Senior Citizens and Pensionersof Nova Scotia if it is a provincial matter. The FSCPNS considers the resolution(s) and if appropriate refers it (them) to the ProvincialMinister through Senior Citizens' Secretariat,an arm of the Provincial Government dealing with seniors. 3. A purpose of the councils is to promote the general principles of the senior movement:support the dignity of seniors, their health,their welfare and their independence. 4. Councils, since they are composed of senior leaders, can present an example of structurefor conducting proper meetings and electionof officers, and generally teaching seniorsleadership skills by example and inworkshops. 5. Councils can bring together all the senior for area wide activities such as ecumenicalservices, dances, picnics, fairs and seniorgames. These activities can be cooperative in nature or perhaps competitive to promote a bit of enthusiasm and excitement. Lucy F .

The Senior Contact Program will allow police to contact seniors once a week to make sure theyare safe and healthy . Similar programs have beeninitiated in other places in Canada. An official contract was signed between police and the Cape Breton Council of Senior Citizensand Pensioners. The program will determine the number of seniors living in industrial Cape Breton whorequire or wish to have telephone contact due to being isolated or lonely with no family orneighborly contact, as well as any other seniorinterested in benefiting from this service. \"It's designed for seniors that are isolated,\" said Const. Brad Burke. \"What takes place is, duringthe week, we'll contact them or a member oftheir family , and if they're not available, we'llactually send a police car over to their home.\" Burke said some seniors in the area are living on their own. Some of them don't have muchcontact with other people and the program willlet the police know if they are OK. He noted there have been times when police have found seniors sick or injured in their residencesand unable to get help. He added there have alsobeen a number of occasions when police havefound seniors deceased in their homes. The program will prepare and implement telephone schedules based on the results of theassessed needs of seniors. In addition, it will provide a variety of activities for seniors to interact with other seniors of various backgrounds. Designed by the Cape Breton Council of Senior Citizens and Pensioners, the program is expectedto begin Jan. 28. It will be run out of theWhitney Pier Police Community Office. Call 563-5104 or 539-6511 for information on this free service.

Hearing impairment affects one in 10North Americans, and it is estimated that almosthalf of the population over 65 suffer from somedegree of hearing loss. Health professionals in avariety of disciplines can play a key role inhelping their patients/clients with hearing loss toaddress this common problem. Types of hearing loss Hearing loss can be classified in two main categories conductive and sensorineural. Conductive hearing loss is caused primarily by a mechanical problem in the middle ear or earcanal that disrupts or blocks the conduction ofsound. The result is a poor transmission of sound waves via the eardrum, the failure of the ossicular bones to transmit sound, or both. Commoncauses of conductive hearing loss includeexcessive wax blocking the ear, fluid in themiddle ear and a perforated eardrum. In most cases of conductive hearing loss, hearing can be restored to some degree, if not completely .This is achieved by removing or repairing thecause of the hearing loss. For example, wax canbe removed, infections treated and fluid drained. Even a damaged eardrum can be repaired through a precision surgical procedure using a minisculeskin graft. For severe or complete conductivehearing loss, special bone conduction hearingaids are available, as well as special devices calledbone anchored hearing aids {BAHA). Sensorineural hearing loss results from the reduced ability or failure of the nerve cells toreceive transmitted sound. In most cases,sensorineural hearing loss is not reversible andcompensatory management strategies are used. This type of hearing loss is often further broken down into sensory hearing loss (when the innerear is affected) or neural hearing loss (when theauditory nerve or nerve pathways in the brain are affected). Sensory hearing loss can be caused by genetic factors (i.e. heredity), exposure to loud and/orconstant noise (acoustic trauma), a viral infection, certain drugs or Meniere's disease. Neural hearingloss can result from infections, a brain tumour orother brain or nerve disorders, such as a stroke.In addition, the auditory nerve can be damagedat an early age by childhood diseases, includingmumps and rubella (German measles), as well as severe inner ear infections and meningitis. Presbycusis The major cause of sensorineural hearing loss,however, is presbycusis, or age-related \"old man's hearing\". It is a commoncondition affecting as many as 40 per cent ofpeople over 65, and experts report that by age 80 almost everyone will suffer from some degreeof hearing loss. Presbycusis causes gradual, progressive, high frequency hearing loss that tends to affect bothears at the same time. Presbycusis usually beginsbetween the ages of 40 and 50 and becomesslowly and progressively worse over time. Itaffects men more frequently and severely thanwomen. The speed and extent of this progressionvaries from person to person. Presbycusis develops as the middle ear goes through the process of ageing. The eardrumslowly loses its elasticity and the joints of theossicular bones stiffen. This hampers the soundwaves being conveyed from the outer ear to thecochlea. However, it is the age-driven changes inthe inner ear that have more impact. A structurein the inner ear called the cochlea is vital to thehearing process. Tiny hairs in the cochlea areresponsible for detecting and transmitting soundsto the brain. Presbycusis occurs when these haircells fail to properly do their job. These hair cellsgradually deteriorate over time and become lesseffective, resulting in an inability to pick upcertain higher frequency sounds. As such, it iscommon for people with presbycusis to 'hear'speech but be unable to distinguish sounds incertain ranges (for example, consonants, such as's' and 't'). 24 5beginning of a new life stage. We need to plan for \u2014and beyond\u2014retirement. Today , retirementcan provide the opportunity to travel, volunteer,spend time with family and friends or do all thethings there never seemed to be time for before.Retirement can mean leaving a job or continuingto work full-time in a second career, part-time, or in a self-employed or freelance position. With our increased life expectancy (the average Canadian can now expect to live 78 years,compared with 59 in the 19205) many of us will be spending 20 or 30 years in retirement\u2014asignificant part of our life, for sure! And as Baby-Boomers (those born between 1946 and 1965)enter their 505, Canadians of retirement age willcontinue to be a growing force. Travel and leisureindustries will boom. In 1998, Sport Canada reported that golf, considered by many to be the ultimate symbol of the retired life, has replaced hockey asCanada's most popular sport. As well, retireesenjoy activities such as walking, gardening andcycling, and older Canadians are the age groupmost likely to take time to read. So as the population gets older and the Baby Boom generation approaches retirement, theneeds and lifestyle requirements of retirees willcontinue to change. In 1996, 11.2 per cent of Canadians were retired, according to a study by Statistics Canada onCanada's Changing Retirement Patterns. Here aresome of the findings of that study: 1. The highest percentage of retirees reside in British Columbia and Ontario (13 and 12per cent respectively). 2. Fourteen per cent of men and eight per cent of women reported being retired. Themajority of women aged 60 or over havenever been in the labor force. As more\"younger women\" now work outside thehome, the men versus women retirementratio is expected to balance out. 3. T wo-thirds of retirees (80 per cent of retired men, 45 per cent of the women)were married or living common-law. Tenper cent of retired women were single;almost 40 per cent of them widowed. Thisis not surprising given that womengenerally live longer than men and marry\"older\" men. Seventeen per cent of the menand 44 per cent of the women lived alone. 4. Women retired earlier than men (at age 58.5 compared with 61.4) to spend timewith their retired spouses, care for relativesor because of poor health. Men's reasonswere often related to their own health or toearly retirement packages. 5. Men eligible for registered retirement or pension benefits were more likely to retirebefore 65. Women with such plans, onaverage, worked to the age of 60.6 whilewomen without such benefits worked toage 57.4. 6. Part-time and self-employed workers delayed retirement for financial reasons, or because they were already slowing downin preparation for their retirement. Maleteachers retired earlier (59.4 years) thanmen in the service industry (60.8) and inconstruction and transportation (60.8).Female clerical workers retired earlier(56.8) than women in the primary sector(57.3) or those who were managers andprofessionals (57.8). 7. Thirteen per cent of retirees returned to work, usually as self-employed, part-timeor temporary workers. These \"retirees\"were more likely to be men, with a highereducation and \"younger.\" One-quarterreturned to work for financial reasons, one-half for other reasons, such as wantingto keep busy or for the social aspects.

Mr. Collenette also announced $167,450 for six sustainabletransportation projects as part of thefourth round of funding in the original phase ofthe program. These projects cover a range ofinitiatives that will contribute to a moreenvironmentally friendly transportation system. \"Projects funded through MOST over the past two years have successfully delivered concreteresults. Extension of this program for anotherfive years demonstrates Transport Canada'songoing commitment to fostering a sustainabletransportation system that is safe, efficient, cost-effective and beneficial for the environment,\"said Mr. Collenette. MOST fulfills a commitment made in Transport Canada's first Sustainable Development Strategy ,which was tabled in Parliament in 1997. Theprogram was launched with approximately $1million to be provided to successful projectproposals over a period of three and four fundingrounds. This funding has been allocated to 26initiatives aimed at encouraging sustainabletransportation. Final approval for funding issubject to meeting the financial and otherrequirements of the program.MOST assists organizations such as environmental groups, community associations,academic institutions, and business andprofessional associations. These groups are conducting projects and delivering concrete results in support of Transport Canada's commitment to sustainable transportation. In addition, the projects are helping to improve the public's understanding of sustainable transportation issues. Through MOST, Transport Canada is able to manage funding requests in a more transparent and equitable fashion. An advisory committee prioritizes projects and recommends funding allocations. Projects may receive up to a maximum of $100,000 over two years and mustreceive at least 50 percent of resources fromsources other that the Government of Canada. \"Through MOST, the Government of Canada is helping to find ways to meet the transportationneeds of Canadians, while helping to protect theenvironment for present and future generations,\"added Mr. Collenette. Funding for the extension of this program was provided for in the December 2001 budget and istherefore built into the current fiscal framework. Information on MOST, including an applicant's guide and project results, can be found onTransport Canada's web site athttp://www.tc.gc.ca/EnvAffairs/MOST/. 4 25Myths 1. There is just one sign language for all countries. Just as there is no one spoken language for all countries, there is no one, universal sign language. There are more than 100 sign languages used in the world today. Every sign language reflects itsown history, culture and social values, and mayhave many regional variations. 2. Only a few people have a hearing loss and chances are, I will not be affected. The odds are that you or someone close to you has some degree of haring loss. In fact, it hasbeen estimated that one in ten people experiencesome degree of hearing loss. 3. My child will be limited because of his/her deafness. Do not consider your child as sick. He or she is as normal as any other child; the only differenceis that he/she cannot hear . 4. All deaf people use sign language. Culturally deaf people use sign language. Many people with a hearing loss do not knowsign language. 5. All hearing losses are the same. The single term \"hearing loss\" covers a wide range of losses that have very different effects ona person's ability to process sound and, therefore,to understand speech. 6. Deaf people are not sensitive to noise. Some types of hearing loss actually accentuate sensitivity to noise. Loud sounds become garbledand uncomfortable. Hearing aid users often findloud sounds, which are greatly magnified bytheir aids, very unpleasant.7. Parents lose their deaf children to the deaf community . Deaf people who enjoyed a close rapport and good communication, signing or oral, with theirparents while growing up tend to remain close tothem for the rest of their lives. 8. All deaf and hard of hearing people are good speechreaders. Many factors are involved int the success of speachreading. People with a hearing loss are notinherently better speechreaders. 9. People with a cochlear implant have a hole in their head and cannot swim or take ashower. People can definitely swim and bathe with their implanted devices. There is no opening in thehead at all with modern devices. The implant iscompletely covered by the skin behind the ear .People need only to remove their extendedprocessor and headpiece before swimming orbathing, just as hearing aid users remove theiraids.Where are we now? The project is approximately at the halfway point. The initial data collection is completedand findings have undergone two levels ofanalysis, initially at the community level bycommunity working groups mostly comprised ofseniors and then at the regional level to identifycommon themes and barriers. Recommendationsfrom the community working groups will help togenerate draft community-based social marketingmessages and strategies that will be tested in thepilot communities for their potential to create thedesired changes in behaviour. What is next? After the messages are tested in the pilotcommunities they will undergo final revisionsand be put to use in the pilot communities.Recommendations will be made to the provincialpartners and Health Canada for using similarmessages and strategies across the Atlantic regionand nationally . It is hoped that armed withbehaviour-based messaging and newly developedpartnerships, rural Atlantic communities willhave avenues to improve the mental healthoutlook and quality of life of their seniors. The project ends in August of 2002. References: 1. In, Abraham, I.L. Buckwalter, K.C., Chalifoux, Z., Litwak, E. & Neese, I.B.

Submitted by: Maureen Rogers, BN, M.Ed.The Changing Face of Retirement According to Statistics Canada, in 1970, 84 per cent of men aged 55 to 64 were in the laborforce, but that rate dropped to 60 per cent aquarter century later. For women in the same age group, the rate decreased only slightly . What's behind these changes? Early retirement programs and incentives are part of the reasonCanadians are retiring earlier. In 1987, theminimum age for receiving Canada/QuebecPension Plan benefits dropped to 60 from 65,and the proportion of Canadians aged 60 to 64drawing those benefits rose from 20 to 38 percent between 1987 and 1993. Private pensionplans also playa role in this trend. Retirement, of course, is not always a matter of choice. During Canada's recession a decade ago,211,000 Canadians retired earlier than they hadoriginally planned. Buyouts, layoffs and forcedretirement are also becoming a common reality . But retirement can no longer be defined simply in terms of age, years of service or pensioneligibility . Rather it is a life transition that reflects many factors: gender, occupation,financial status, family circumstances, health,lifestyle, education, the strength and stability ofan individual's employment situation, and theeconomy in general, as well as the interplay ofcurrent socio-economic policies and trends. In a StatsCan study on Canada's Changing Retirement Patterns, about half of retireesreported enjoying life more than the year beforethey retired. They were especially happy abouthaving more leisure time and time for family .One in five retirees enjoyed life less, giving asreasons poorer health, followed by less socialcontact and decreased income. About one-third of retirees believed their financial situation had worsened since retirement. Thisopinion was more common among youngerretirees and those forced into retirement. There is no one route to retirement. Nor does the journey end once you get there. It is the 26 3Goal of the Project The goal of the project is to design an evidence- based strategy for developing social marketingmessages and formats in communities to addressproblems of depression among rural seniors inAtlantic Canada, in order to improve the mentalhealth and quality of life of this growing segmentof the population. Researchers will work with partners and volunteers in the pilot sites to seek ways for buildingcommunity capacity and cooperative solutions. The Process This is a qualitative and participatory projectassisted by seniors in rural areas where focusgroups and interviews with key members of thecommunity are helping to explore the issue ofdepression in rural elderly . In particular, theproject is focusing on situational depression inrural seniors, depression arising from stressfullife events such as the death of a spouse, chronicillness, multiple losses, the strain of constantcaregiving etc. Participants in the focus groupsand interviews share known barriers to accessinghelp for mental problems and some suggestionsfor making improvements for the future. With the assistance of LURA Consulting, a local community-based social marketing firm,techniques will be applied to the findings of theproject, and will result in strategies for behaviourchanges such as, seniors and families activelyreaching out for help or learning strategies toprevent depression in the first place. Four pilotstudy sites are Musquodoboit, NS,Caraquet, County , PEI. All participants andresearchers are seeking ways to enhance thecapacities of communities and to develop projectpartners to help address the issue. Older Surfers by Cynthia Silver Every day , the Internet becomes more embedded in our lives. Business, media and government areembracing it as a way to provide services to theirclients and the general public. Schools requirechildren and teens to use it as a research tool andlibraries and community centres offer access tothose without a home connection. The 2000 General Social Survey (GSS) shows that nearly every teenager used the Net but thatuse drops quickly with each successive agegroup. Older Canadians are much less likely touse the Internet than young people, though theirnumbers are growing: in doing so, manyCanadians aged 60 and over may reduce theimpact of social isolation following retirementand the onset of age-related health conditions.Older adults are benefiting from access tonetworked communities through the Internet. Older people are the fastest growing group of users. Among Canadians aged 60 and over, only13% (614,000) had used the Internet in 1999. Ofthose aged 60 and over, men were nearly twice aslikely (17%) as women (9%) to use the Net. Use grew fastest among those aged 60 and over from 1999 to 2000. Growth was strongest amongolder women, 43% of whom had started usingthe Net in the last year compared with 25% ofolder men. On average, older surfers spent anaverage of 6 hours per week on the Net, aboutthe same as 45 to 54 year-olds. Most older users (80%) go online for personal interest or entertainment. Older Canadiansprimarily searched for online information ongoods and services (57% of surfers), news (54%) and health information (38%). Half of older surfers looked for online travel information and 41%looked for information on arts, entertainment or sports. One-third looked for business oreconomic news. As people age, they may tend to become socially isolated. A lower income after retirement,declining physical ability and the loss of a spouseare examples of changes that may cause olderCanadians to lose touch with people. However, the Internet seems to be a valuable tool in maintaining contact with others. Nearly allolder Internet users (87%) used e-mail and theywere sending messages almost as often asyounger people: 69% who had used it in the lastmonth did so at least several times a week, as did76% of those under age 60. Although olderpeople e-mailed their family more often thanyounger people did, old and young e-mail userswere equally likely to stay in touch with friends.And while women have had the traditional roleof sustaining family relationships, men were just as likely as women to use e-mail to keep in touch. Home connections are more popular amongolder people as they generally have moremobility and transportation problems to dealwith, which suggests they have limited access tolocations with Internet connections. A homeconnection offers older adults the opportunity tosocialize with others, pursue life-long learningand participate in community activities. It canassist with activities of daily living such asshopping and managingmoney . Thirty-five percent Web-basedtraining, informal helpfrom a friend or relative aswell as trial and error to acquirecomputer skills. The Internet can open the world to older people who may feel isolated and lonely . Many seniors'groups now offer programs to help older adultsbecome familiar with computers and to assistthem with Internet access.
