Harry Gordon is one of the country's most distinguished sports writers, commentators and analysts. Whether it's writing a speech for the Australian Olympic delegation, or analysing the competitive qualities of Dawn Fraser or Emil Zatopek, Harry Gordon's the man you want. So with the sporting leviathan that is the Beijing Games looming into sight, this week we'll hear from a man limbering up for his ninth Olympiad. Harry Gordon, first of all, welcome again to The Sports Factor on ABC Radio National. Harry Gordon: Thank you very much, Mick. Mick O'Regan: Harry, 1952 in Helsinki sees the first Olympics that you go and cover; 2008 in Beijing is now just weeks and days away. Do you still have pre-Olympic anticipation? Harry Gordon: Yes, I do. I don't know whether I'm different from other people but I was so keen and enthusiastic about going to Helsinki and I find myself equally so now, going to Beijing. Mick O'Regan: And it's a 56-year gap between the two? Harry Gordon: Yes, it's astonishing, isn't it? Mick O'Regan: It is astonishing. Harry Gordon: The funny thing is that the enthusiasm remains; I am rather hooked on the Olympics, I'm addicted, you could say, but I've come to have great affection for them. Mick O'Regan: Indeed, and I'd like to explore that affection, and also what you see as the major changes that have occurred in more than half a century of closely following the Olympic Games. When I look at the photos of Helsinki, it seems so innocent and such a sport event and not a political event. Is that for you a key difference, that politics hadn't emerged and that sport was pre-eminent? Harry Gordon: I think that's pretty right. Politics had been part of the Olympics before of course, I you had mean the 1936 Olympics, the Nazi Olympics, the Hitler Games. But there was a great pervading innocence around the Games of I think '48, which I didn't attend but they were the first coming out after the Second World War. Certainly there was a lovely innocence about Helsinki, Melbourne and Rome. They were very sweet Games. Mick O'Regan: And informal, compared to contemporary Games? Harry Gordon: Yes, almost embarrassingly so. The uniforms were sometimes not smart; when there was a smart one that really stood out, and the Opening Ceremonies were - they seemed very exciting at the time but they were fairly dreary processions. There were bands and people marching around in their various contingents in blazers. But they were exciting events at the time. Mick O'Regan: And covered in quite a different way. The billions who now see instantaneously live to screen or live to TV, or whatever platform they're watching on. In those days it was very much a filtered exercise; there were people at the event, and then later people heard accounts and saw photographs. Harry Gordon: That's right. In Helsinki, where it was really a print-covered Games, and that meant that even with the print, with the newspaper coverage, the agencies, the newsagencies, which had a greater break on communications, had a much better news service than the newspapers. The newspapers for instance in Helsinki, for - I was working for AAP then, a newsagency, and there were just two of us covered the Games. And we had a wonderful break on communications, although we had at that time, sunspots used to interfere with our communications, but the other papers, for instance The Sydney Morning Herald, The Age, the daily papers of Australia, they had trouble even getting their copy into London, it was 2 Shillings a word at Urgent rate to get copy into London before it was onpassed to Melbourne, and that was a fairly prohibitive rate. So there were very few words published. What actually happened was that the agencies covered most of the Games. Mick O'Regan: The recent discussion and the withdrawal from the Games of Jana Rawlinson and concerns now over Nathan Deakes I think has now withdrawn; that what seemed a fairly meagre spread of medal prospects for our track and field team it seems has thinned even more. What was it like to be in Melbourne when Australia's track and field riches were extraordinary when you consider particularly the Australian women athletes who ran. Harry Gordon: The women did marvellously, yes, to be there and to see Betty Cuthbert win those three Gold Medals and just streak down that - I shut my eyes, and still see Betty skimming down that track, a brick-red track against the green grass in the centre, and Shirley similarly over the 80 metres hurdles, Shirley Strickland, winning her Gold Medal. They were wonderful events, and then of course the girls combined for the sprint relays. That was a marvellous performance on the track. The track for the men, we weren't quite successful, but we got a second in the high jump and Hec Hogan ran third in the 100 metres, but it was just marvellous; the track and field at the Melbourne Games was superb. We had Vladimir Kuts, the Russian who won the 5,000 and 10,000 metres and looking back, what stays with me is the tremendous reception he got, because those Games were held at a difficult time in terms of global conflict. The Cold War was taking a hold, the Russians had just invaded Hungary, troops were massing on the Suez Canal, and the two Chinas were having trouble. So in all of that edginess, and it was an edginess which caused several nations to withdraw, including Netherlands and Switzerland. There was this marvellous spirit from the crowd, which had been conditioned by the news media to expect the Russians to be enemies, and in fact the Russian team was living separately from the other teams, was living on a ship in Port Phillip Bay, but the accord that the crowds gave to people like Vladimir Kuts and all of the other Iron Curtain athletes, I felt was just wonderful. Mick O'Regan: And that friendliness that did characterise Melbourne, from what I've read seemed very much to continue on four years later to Rome in 1960, because people have said that they were a very friendly, very enthusiastic Games as well. Harry Gordon: They were. I mean I'm biased. When people ask me about Games, I talk of the Melbourne Games as when they were dubbed 'the friendly Games', and they deserved to be, and I loved the Sydney Games, but I must say one of the happiest Games I ever saw was the Rome Games. It was again as in Sydney in 2000, there was a spirit about, a mood about in the streets. There were flags across the alleyways, people greeted each other, there was a lovely mood abroad. Mick O'Regan: Now when we come to those Games of the early '60s of course, Dawn Fraser just looms large across Australia, or world sport. She was this remarkable woman, you know the first person to win I think three consecutive Gold Medals in the same event. You had a very close relationship with Dawn Fraser at the peak of her swimming. What was it like to be near and with her when she was in that form and being the superstar of those Games? Harry Gordon: Oh I enjoyed it. I have a very good relationship with Dawn. I knew her from the time she was 16 when she first started swimming at a senior level, and of course through, as you say, she was the first swimmer of either gender to win three Gold Medals in a row in the same event, and she just did it so effortlessly, she did it against - the thing I admire most about Dawn is that she overcome so many handicaps. She was a bad asthmatic, she grew up in Balmain and used to play in a disused coalmine, among the coal dust, and she overcame all sorts of - she was really rubbed out as a professional for a while before her swimming career began, because she took some trifling amount of money 2/6d or whatever for winning a club race. But she went on, she knew she could win, that was the big thing. When we were coming up to the third of that trio of Gold Medals, the one in Tokyo, and as I say, we had been quite close. There was an American book publisher in town and he wanted to know about any ideas that local authors had. I'd written two books and I went along to talk to him, told him this idea of mine that Dawn would win another Gold Medal and this would be unprecedented, and I thought it was not just an Australian book but a world-wide book. And he agreed. And I made an arrangement with him, so Dawn and I swapped notes a lot. She agreed to keep a diary for me in Tokyo, which I didn't attend, I didn't attend those Games, and we brought the book out quite soon after the Games. We did not know of course when we were planning all of this, the events that were going to occur, that she was going to be expelled from swimming, suspended for such a long time, for 10 years at first, it was such a cruel penalty. Mick O'Regan: So Harry, just remind me, what was the misdemeanour? Harry Gordon: Well as a historian I tried to find out later on, and I went through all of the relevant papers, but from the actual swimming report of those Games, and a certain portion had been excised, and I really mean scissored out. And so they're never on the historical record, but the fact of them was that she marched against orders, the swimmers were told not to march in the Opening Ceremony, and she insisted on marching. And I must say with the concurrence of some officials; there were some very tough, small-minded officials and there were some very benevolent officials, and she hid in the bus, because she knew that if she'd been spotted, she would have been taken off. She marched in that ceremony against orders. She then wore a swimsuit against orders, she claimed that her asthma made her not like the official swimsuit, which I think was a Speedo and there was some endorsement involvement. She had a local involvement with another dressmaker. But the crowning thing although I don't think this was what caused her to be dealt with so harshly, but she did get involved in a caper after the Games where she pinched a flag from the gardens outside the Emperor's Palace. She was chased by police and she was finally apprehended and taken into custody, but when the police got to know who she was, she was welcomed very much, and in fact exchanged hugs with the police officers who took her in. Mick O'Regan: Talk about animal magnetism. Personal charm, perhaps. Sports writer and Olympic expert, Harry Gordon. As Harry Gordon prepares to cover his ninth Olympiad, from the dozens of Gold Medal performances he's witnessed, I asked him to nominate his ultimate. Harry Gordon: I suppose the most important single medal was that of Herb Elliott. I think that that probably was the most brutal, authoritative Gold Medal I've ever seen. He crushed the opposition and he did it in a pitiless sort of a way. Herb was just so good, he was never beaten over 1500 metres or a mile, and he won that race, the 1500 metres in Rome in 1960 by the greatest margin ever, and also by about 20 metres. And also in a world record time. And it's not generally recognised that Herb's time in Rome in 1960 would have won the Gold Medal at seven subsequent Olympic Games, including '96. When you think about it, that's 36 years later, and as we all know, records have a habit of diminishing, that's what they do. Mick O'Regan: Particularly middle distance records like that, where small gains over 1500 metres can occur regularly. That's an extraordinary feat, isn't it? Harry Gordon: Yes. So when you say is there a single medal which means a lot, I think that his single medal means as much as a lot of other multi Gold Medal winners' performances. Mick O'Regan: Now I've always been a fan of the 1500 metres through a fleeting association as a schoolboy. Tell me about the style of Herb Elliott's win in Rome; was it a question of simply going from the front and opening up a gap that was never closed? Harry Gordon: Yes. What happened is that he spoke with Percy Cerutty, his coach, the night before, and the tactic was simply to have a good first lap then break away and demoralise. He was aware that most of the other competitors had not approached his times. He was a world record holder in both 1500 and mile. He had recently in Dublin run an absolutely fantastic mile, and he knew that the other competitors were mentally cowed. So the idea was to absolutely break their spirit in the second and third laps, and he just took off, and he just kept going away. They had a plan, he and Percy, that Percy if he had a chance of setting a world record, or if he was being challenged, Percy would wave a yellow towel at him. Percy waved the towel, I don't think Herb even saw it, but he kept running, and it was just a magnificent win. The others were as they had planned, completely demoralised, and they were beaten before they started I think. But that's what happened. Mick O'Regan: Let's stay with Percy Cerutty just for a moment, because he was a sort of extravagant figure within Australian athletics, wasn't he, a radical re-thinking of the sort of physical fitness that you needed and the stamina that you needed. Did you get to know him well through your associations? Harry Gordon: Very well. I've got almost a boxful of letters he wrote me, which I'll one day give to the National Library. Yes, we had a good relationship, but I saw Percy thrown out of several villages actually. He was frog-marched out of the Cardiff Empire Games village in 1958 and he was not welcome in many villages, but he still would bluff his way in, he had a marvellous spirit. He would don a tracksuit and jog in with a group of athletes and get inside the village. Mick O'Regan: What would have caused his exclusion? Harry Gordon: At that stage, there were two things: coaches were not as well looked upon as they are these days, in fact the swimming coaches were banned from pool decks. And the other thing was that he was such an anti-establishment character. He wasn't accepted very well by administrators, but he was a magnificent coach. And the thing about him as a coach was that some athletes, they resented his intrusion. He really did want to intrude into their mind and he wanted to feed them Plato and a lot of literature as well as a lot of raw oats and an unusual diet, which Herb Elliott once called chook food. But he wanted to enter their minds, and a number of mature athletes like Ron Clarke later, and John Landy earlier, they wouldn't let Percy in there into their minds. But he caught Herb just at a moment in his career where the chemistry, the synchronisation, was just wonderful, and he was a magnificent trainer and conditioner of athletes. Mick O'Regan: He pioneered all the sandhill running, yes? Harry Gordon: Sandhill running, yes. And I must say in Helsinki, he was wonderful there. Again, he sneaked into places where he wasn't supposed to go, and one place he sneaked into was the Russian village; again the Iron Curtain athletes in Helsinki stayed separately from the other athletes. That was the first time the Cold War absolutely intruded into the Games. And Percy wanted to meet Emil Zatopek, who was a marvellous, marvellous competitor. Mick O'Regan: Emil Zatopek would have been the sort of runner that would really have attracted Percy's interest. Harry Gordon: Exactly. For a number of reasons. One, he was just such a marvellous runner, marvellous competitor. I mean what he did in Helsinki to win the 5,000 metres, the 10,000 metres and the marathon, it was simply unprecedented. The thing about Zatopek was that he was a very kind man, he was a teacher of sorts, and he was very willing to impart his knowledge to young athletes and particularly young Australians sat at his feet a bit; people like John Landy, Les Perry, Ray Weinberg, a number of the Australians who were in Helsinki. But Percy recognised that he was a teacher and a teacher that he respected, and he used his tracksuit device to get inside the Iron Curtain village where Zatopek was living, and found Emil Zatopek. Emil Zatopek was such a marvellous person, he was very happy to talk with Percy. They talked for hours, and Emil talked about his own individual training methods, his distinctive style of training for distance running, and Percy absorbed all of that. Mick O'Regan: If we jump way forward Harry to the current debate around the ability of athletes to talk while they're in the Beijing Games, while they're in the village, about issues that aren't specifically related to the Olympics but are germane to broader debates about China and its role in the world. And one of the things has been a solidarity group that's emerged, wanting athletes to lend their celebrity to appeal to China to change its attitude in Sudan for the people of Darfur, there's diplomatic pressure on the Chinese to have a different role. So Team Darfur has emerged, and some of the people speaking on its behalf are Olympic athletes. Now on the program over recent weeks and months, we've touched on this. What's your sense of someone who's obviously been in lots of Olympic villages and seen athletes there; do you think that's going to be a big issue, athletes' desire to talk about politics? Harry Gordon: I don't think it'll be a big issue. I think some individual athletes have expressed a desire to wear t-shirts, I think Cadel Evans wants to wear a Free Tibet t-shirt around the village, I don't think that the Olympic authorities are going to prevent him, the Australian Olympic authorities, but it is a move that he has to contemplate. I think generally the athletes are fairly happy not to provoke any kind of outrage from the authorities. Mick O'Regan: Because whenever this topic comes up, the reference is always made to Peter Norman, the late Peter Norman, who in 1968 in the 200 metres finished second and was on the podium with the two African-American athletes, John Carlos and Tommie Smith who raised their gloved fists in a Black Power salute. Now on the day, Norman wore a solidarity badge, I think Olympic protest for human rights. He was reprimanded by the chef de mission, Judy Patching, but it seems such a different period. And you're someone who I am going to assume is familiar with how Judy Patching might have approached Peter Norman. Before we get on to the current situation, what was it like in '68, to your knowledge? Harry Gordon: I knew both those individuals very well, and still know Judy Patching very well. In fact I spoke to him yesterday. Peter was a very refreshing sort of guy, and he was a very extrovert sort of guy and he did wear a t-shirt, but then the first t-shirt he wore had 'God is Love' across the back of it, and he had played in a Salvation Army band, he was a very idealistic young man. In that incident in Mexico City, he did wear a human rights badge. He accepted the Medal, he didn't take a very active part in that protest, although he will live with it forever. I mean he'll be part of it forever in Olympic history, but what he did do afterwards was sympathise with the two athletes and what they'd done, which offended Avery Brundage who was the Olympic supremo, and also offended the American Olympic team, was that they had at the time that these stars and stripes, the American flag, was being raised, they looked downwards and they raised their fists. Both each wore a glove, a black glove in protest. And after that ceremony, Peter was interviewed by the media and he said 'Every man has a right to human dignity, and if necessary to protest', and he took their side. Now I'm not sure where the word came for Judy Patching who was then chef de mission to reprimand Peter, but at some stage it arrived, and Judy who is a very wise man, a very wonderful man, called Peter in and said, 'Peter, consider yourself reprimanded. Now how many tickets do you want for the tennis?' And that was the level of seriousness. It was mock-serious. Mick O'Regan: As we look specifically towards Beijing, what are your thoughts about this Olympics? Do you have particular enthusiasms or concerns as 8th August rolls around? Harry Gordon: A bit of a concern about the pollution I think, and that might be personal, as well as for the athletes. But generally, what I think can be said so far is that the Games will be massively spectacular; they mean so much to China, it's their emergence, they've been a global superpower for a long time, but this is their emergence, their opening of the doors, their welcome of the world. And they're going to be tremendously spectacular. I think China will also do very, very well at those Games. For the rest there are some unknowns ahead. I think that from Australia's point of view, the objective is to get into the top five nations and I think that Australia will, even though they've had a couple of recent setbacks like the withdrawal of Jana Rawlinson and of Nathan Deakes. But I think that generally, Australia will continue, to use that clich\u00e9 that's been overused recently, will continue to punch above its weight in terms of population. Mick O'Regan: Just on that, who do you think the mainstays of medals will be for Australia? I mean I think there are teams like the hockey teams for example which sort of fly under the radar a bit between Games, but then turn in some extraordinary performances over the years. There's obviously great strength in the women's swimming, it would seem to be less so in men's swimming but I might be wrong there. Where else are you looking for key performances? Harry Gordon: Well I think first you mentioned swimming and while there is a marvellous women's team, there's a pretty good men's team, and I think that you'll find that the - I mean you've got people like Grant Hackett and Eammon Sullivan. I think that it's the first time I can recall for quite a while that there's been an even balance of the genders in the swimming team. I think you're quite right that a number of the team sports fly under the radar and they will be very potent, but the yachtsmen have done marvellously in all of the pre-Games events. The rowers have qualified for the first time ever in every event. I think that they'll be bountiful Games for Australia and I think there'll be a spread of medals. I think the cyclists again will do well. Mick O'Regan: Now Harry, I'm going to ask you this question and I can almost feel you, you begin to flinch as I form the words because I'm sure you've just been asked it so many times. But at the end of the day when you're packing your notebooks and your laptop and your pencils, are there individual performances that for you still exemplify what you want to see at the Olympics? Harry Gordon: Yes. I think there are, and I think they often relate to not just to the winning of medals which is always wonderful to see, the highest pinnacle of achievement, but if you're referring to sportsmanship there are just so many instances. I always feel privileged to see them. One was Grant Davies, the 500 kayak representative in Seoul, who had a Gold Medal for 11 minutes. He was named after the event as the winner, his name went up on the scoreboard, he signed for the Gold Medal, he was hailed by a very noisy crowd, and just before the victory ceremony, there was a late flash that the jury had looked at the finish of the event and decided that the American, Greg Barton had won it by .002 of a second, which is a coat of varnish, and Grant Davies, the media immediately, particularly the Australian media, said, 'How disappointed are you? How can you live with this?' and Grant said, 'Look, if that's the biggest disappointment I ever have, I'll have a pretty happy life', and the very interesting aspect of that is that I live in Main Beach in Queensland, and I go for walks along the beach most mornings, and the lifeguard on duty is a bloke called Grant Davies and he is a very happy man, he has had a very happy life. Mick O'Regan: That's right. I remember that great ad that the Olympic movement put out, that when people said that winning Silver is just first amongst the losers, had obviously never won Silver, and there were some of the most exuberant Silver Medal performances I'd seen. Harry Gordon, it's a pleasure to have you on The Sports Factor here on ABC Radio National. Thank you very much, and enjoy what's coming up in Beijing 2008. Harry Gordon: Thank you very much Mick, I've enjoyed talking with you, as always. Mick O'Regan: Harry Gordon. His new book, his 15th, is called 'Gold: An Olympic Celebration' and it's published by Wilkinson. And that's it for the show for this week. As always, thanks to team of producer Andrew Davies, and to our technical producers Peter McMurray and Jim Ussher. Harry Gordon first set out to report on the Olympics in Helsinki in 1952 and now, more than half a century later, he's turned his gaze to Beijing. This week on The Sports Factor meet the master of Australian sports writing. "}
