Welcome to your billing and coding weekly solutions by H. J. Ross Company where getting your bills paid is what we do best! Similar to the vaccine mandates under the VA which did not include chiropractic offices or community providers, the newest Federal mandate announced by President Biden on September 10, 2021, does NOT include chiropractic providers or offices. The new mandate is for Medicare facility providers such as hospitals and skilled nursing facilities. It does not include fee-for-service providers which would include doctors of chiropractic. A Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) spokesperson has clarified, \" This regulation does not directly apply to physician's offices as these are not regulated under the provider-specific Medicare health and safety regulatory provisions, generally referred to as \"Conditions of Participation.\" IMPORTANT: Always assure and check with your respective licensing board or state laws. Clarify your state and locality mandates as some jurisdictions have issued vaccine mandates affecting doctors' offices (including doctors of chiropractic). H. J.
