The project is funded by the US Government under USAID's Strengthening Communities through Integrated Programming (SCIP) grant and is implemented by a consortium of partners led by World Vision. The broad goal of the 5-year project is to reduce poverty in Zamb\u0013 ezia by pursuing the consolidation of an integrated, innovative, and sustainable community-based program supporting cross-sector integration of USAID's development actions in the province. Ogumaniha's overall goal is to \\to improve health and livelihoods of children, women and families in the Province of Zamb\u0013 ezia.\" To achieve this goal, Ogumaniha objectives are to: 1. Strengthen and increase access to the health, nutrition and HIV&AIDS care system for its numerous target groups, including: women and men of reproductive age, pregnant and post-partum women, newborns, children under 5 years of age, orphans and vulnerable children (OVC) and people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA); 2. Promote and nance demand-driven community investments for agricultural production, value chain additions, income-generation, health improvement, potable water, and sanitation; and 3. Build and reinforce existing institutional capacity of governmental departments at provincial and district level, and community associations, councils, and groups, to empower them to make decisions that are directly related to improving the living conditions of the rural population. This project is in line with the priorities of the Ministries of Health (MOH), Agriculture (MOA), and Public Works and Housing (MOPH), and in strong coordination with and leadership from the Zamb\u0013 ezia Provincial Health Directorate (DPS), the Provincial Agriculture Directorate (DPA) and the Provincial Directorate of Public Works and Housing (DPOPH). Integral to Ogumaniha's design is a strong monitoring system and project evaluation, based on per- formance indicators agreed upon with USAID and the provincial government. Because the project uses multi-sectoral interventions and an interdisciplinary approach to implementation, in addition to its strong focus on poverty reduction, the consortium opted for an evaluation design that re ects these criteria. A survey instrument to be used at baseline and at project end was designed based on human development theory originated by Amartya Sen (1999) and further developed by researchers from the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Institute (OPHI). This instrument uses multiple dimensions to measure poverty including health, education, income, access to goods and services and self-empowerment. The OPHI is one of the principal contributors to the United Nation's Human Development Index (HDI), and is proposing revisions based on its methodology to improve the index (Alkire and Santos, 2010). The vision of this evaluation is that the information collected can provide a better picture to measure the impact of this large-scale intervention on the health and well being of the households in Zamb\u0013 ezia Province, so that this evaluation design can serve as a model for evaluating health and development in- terventions in Mozambique. The evaluation explores: 1) Zamb\u0013 ezia -wide changes in selected indicators directly linked to project interventions, and 2) Changes related to project intervention intensity in the three focal districts of Namacurra, Morrumbala, and Alto Mol\u0013 ocu\u0012 e. The survey tool was developed by a multi-disciplinary team of researchers including sta , faculty, and graduate students from Vanderbilt University and the University Eduardo Mondlane. Faculty and students involved were from the Departments of Community Medicine, Preventive Medicine, Infectious Diseases, 1In the local Chuabo language, ogumaniha means \\united/integrated for a common purpose.\" ivPediatrics, Epidemiology, Nutrition, Anthropology, Political Science and the Schools of Nursing, Educa- tion, Management, Engineering, and Divinity. The survey designers borrowed many questions and scales deemed appropriate from previous national surveys in Mozambique (including various INE surveys focus- ing on poverty and economic status) and other international surveys (DHS and MICS). The survey was made available to technical and leadership sta at World Vision and each of the consortium partners who provided feedback on questions and design. Data collection for the baseline survey was conducted between 8 August and 25 September, 2010. Fourteen teams of 5 individuals{a team leader and four interviewers{conducted the data collection in two phases, collecting data rst on a Zamb\u0013 ezia-wide sample to provide province-wide estimates, and a second phase collecting data in the three focal districts of Namacurra, Morrumbala, and Alto Mol\u0013 ocu\u0012 e. Interviews were conducted with female heads of household and covered various topics, including socio- demographics, knowledge, attitudes, practices and access to health and HIV-related services and products, access to improved water and sanitation, nutritional intake, agricultural production, and others. Interviews were conducted either in Portuguese or in one of the ve predominant languages of the province, and data was collected using mobile cell phones. Satellite maps along with topographic maps provided by the Na- tional Institute for Statistics (INE) were used to locate enumeration areas to be covered. Anthropometric measures of a random selection of children under 5 years residing in participating households were also included. This report covers the analysis of general estimates of the Ogumaniha project indicators. It is based on the data collected in Phase I of a sample representative of all Zamb\u0013 ezian households. An additional series of analyses focusing on speci c questions relevant to the project and incorporating both Phase I and Phase II data will be carried out and published by June 2011. These analyses will be informed by consultation with government and consortium partners that will be carried out during data dissemination meetings in the months of October and November 2010. Key ndings from the survey are as follows: 1. Reproductive health, pregnancy and antenatal care: \u000fAlthough 31.6% of women interviewed expressed a desire to limit or space births, only 12.8% were using modern contraceptive methods. \u000fReported rates of condom use among all female heads of household participating in the survey was 1.8%. There appears to be no change in reported use of condoms among women in stable relationships between the DHS survey of 2003 (DHS, 2003) and this survey's results. \u000fAccess to antenatal care (ANC) services are still limited (58.2% of women had some ANC during last pregnancy). \u000fReceipt of a complete package of antenatal services is limited. For example, of women receiv- ing antenatal care during their last pregnancy, only 66.1% received fansidar, 65.6% vitamin A supplements, 45.4% mosquito net, 37.9% HIV counseling and testing. Fully, 19.5% of women re- ceiving ANC had all services including fansidar, tetanus toxoid, vitamin A and iron supplements, a bednet and HIV counseling and testing. \u000fOnly 26.1% of all women interviewed reported that they had been o ered counseling and testing for HIV during their last pregnancy. \u000fAbout 43.2% of respondents slept under a mosquito net the night previous to the interview, and 31.0% reported doing so during their last pregnancy. v2. Child health: \u000fData on immunization coverage was limited in part because as children get older, vaccine cards are lost and memories of what immunizations were provided fade. An estimated 64.7% of children under ve had a vaccination card. \u000fAbout 61.5% of children less than one month of age had received BCG and OPV at birth. \u000fAmong children 13 to 59 months 64.0% are fully vaccinated based solely on vaccination card record. Among children aged 13 to 59 months 46.2% had no card AND the mothers report them to be fully vaccinated. \u000fBased on these two estimates, the total proportion of all children 13 to 59 months of age who are fully vaccinated is 56.8% of children. \u000fOur survey likely overestimates the proportion of fully vaccinated children by overestimating those reporting to be fully vaccinated among those children without a vaccination card. \u000fMICS 2008 reports 47% of Zamb\u0013 ezia's 12 to 23 month olds are fully vaccinated (MICS, 2008). In comparison, among the 100 households with a 12{23 month old, 55.3% of those surveyed here were fully vaccinated. \u000fThe prevalence of diarrhea and/or respiratory ailments in last month prior to the survey were high. Over half (56.2%) of households reported children aged 0{59 months su ering from fever, 35.9% from diarrhea, and 34.0% respiratory problems in the four weeks prior to survey. When these health problems presented, a majority of the mothers (65 to 90% depending on the symptoms) sought advice in health facilities. Only a very small proportion of mothers (roughly 2%) reported seeking advice from traditional healers for these childhood symptoms. \u000fAll mothers of children aged 0{59 months reported seeking some form of help if their children had diarrhea, and 78.6% reported using ORT. \u000fAbout 67.3% of mothers of children aged 0{59 months had heard about the oral rehydration product Mistura, and roughly 20% could not name a single instance when they knew they had to take sick child to health clinic. 3. Health services knowledge and access: \u000fOnly 39.9% of respondents knew of the existence of HIV counseling and testing services in the Province, and only 38.7% knew that HIV infection can be treated. \u000fKnowledge of prevention and HIV transmission was low, with as few as 20% of respondents unable to name even one mode of transmission, or prevention methods (between adults or mother-to- child). \u000fUtilization of government health services was fairly low, with only 71.6% of respondents reporting ever having visited a health facility, and 45.1% reported having visited a traditional healer. 4. Livelihoods, water and sanitation, and nutrition: \u000fAn estimated 83.0% of households respondents do not treat drinking water in any way, and over 65.1% do not use a latrine. Of those who use a latrine, 73.0% use an unimproved latrine. \u000f31.5% of the respondents reported having no food of any kind in the house during the four-week period prior to the interview due to lack of resources, and 18.2% of them reported that this happened frequently. \u000fOver one quarter (29.2%) of respondents reported their household received no income of any kind, and an roughly half reported receiving some income, up to 1,000 Meticais (monthly equivalent of about 30 USD { Sept 2010). Therefore the proportion of households estimated having an income of less than 1 USD per day is around 75%. vi\u000fAn estimated 88.3% of respondents report that the household cultivates a small farm, and of those, 84.3% do not report use of any conservation farming technique. \u000fOf farming households, the most commonly grown crops are maize (66.4%), cassava (50.9%), rice (32.7%), and cow and sweet potato (14.3% ). \u000fAmong farming households, only about 28.7% produce enough to sell, and sell mostly maize (49.5%) and cassava (14.5%). \u000fA high proportion of children under ve years of age are severely (16.5%) and moderately (36.4%) chronically malnourished (stunted). These data are comparable to previous values reported for Zamb\u0013 ezia although they appear to have decreased since 2003 (DHS, 2003). Next steps Information from the survey will be disseminated to Ogumaniha partners and government o\u000ecials in the weeks following completion of the survey through a series of fora. One assessment will be designed to be conducted in Year 2 of Ogumaniha implementation, based on the discussions from the partner forum. Lessons learned from the data collection period will be summarized in a separate document and will guide the implementation of the nal, medium-term impact evaluation to be conducted at the end of Ogumaniha's project period. Phase II ndings will next be analyzed and disseminated, to provide concrete information on the three focus districts for the Ogumaniha project. The Phase II ndings will provide further guidance on pro- grammatic areas needing particular attention during project implementation. Both Phase I and Phase II data will be used together to review project targets de ned in the Ogumaniha Project Monitoring Plan, revising them should the need arise. Separate secondary analyses will be conducted on both Phase I and Phase II data. One of the analyses will assess the poverty levels of the community based on the Oxford University multidimensional de nition of poverty. Additional analyses will emerge from the forum discussions as well as from a meeting of all those involved in the development of the survey instrument during a 2-day meeting to be held at Vanderbilt University in mid-November. viiIntroduction Ogumaniha Background The Ogumaniha1Project began implementation in Zamb\u0013 ezia Province, Mozambique in late 2009. The project is funded by the US Government under USAID's Strengthening Communities through Integrated Programming (SCIP) grant and is implemented by a consortium of partners led by World Vision. The broad goal of the 5-year project is to reduce poverty in Zamb\u0013 ezia by pursuing the consolidation of an integrated, innovative, and sustainable community-based program supporting cross-sector integration of USAID's development actions in the province. Ogumaniha's overall goal is to \\to improve health and livelihoods of children, women and families in the Province of Zamb\u0013 ezia.\" To achieve this goal, Ogumaniha objectives are to (a) strengthen and increase access to the health, nutrition and HIV&AIDS care system for its numerous target groups, including: women and men of reproductive age, pregnant and post-partum women, newborns, children under 5 years of age, orphans and vulnerable children (OVC) and people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) (b) promote and nance demand-driven community investments for agricultural production, value chain additions, income-generation, health improvement, potable water, and sanitation; and (c) build and reinforce existing institutional capacity of governmental departments at provincial and district level, and community asso- ciations, councils, and groups, to empower them to make decisions that are directly related to improving the living conditions of the rural population. This project is in line with the priorities of the Ministries of Health (MOH), Agriculture (MOA), and Public Works and Housing (MOPH), and in strong coordination with and leadership from the Zamb\u0013 ezia Provincial Health Directorate (DPS), the Provincial Agriculture Directorate (DPA) and the Provincial Directorate of Public Works and Housing (DPOPH). Ogumaniha capitalizes on structures, experiences, and relationships built by numerous previous and ongoing projects of its consortium members, including USAID-funded COACH, RITA, MozArk, TAM, and MYAP programs, and CDC-funded PEPFAR pro- gramming. Ogumaniha is being implemented under the leadership of World Vision as the prime recipient of the funds with key roles and responsibilities assumed by six experienced and uniquely quali ed part- ners: Adventist Development and Relief Agency (ADRA), ACDI/VOCA, International Relief and Devel- opment (IRD), Vanderbilt University { Friends in Global Health (FGH), John Hopkins University's Center for Communication Programs (JHU/CCP), and Red Cross Mozambique/Cruz Vermelha Mozambicana (CVM). Ogumaniha is also testing an innovative approach to Public-Private Partnerships by leveraging impact with the support of General Mills International, MCel, World Bicycle Relief, and Opportunity International. Ogumaniha Context The percentage of the population living in extreme poverty in Mozambique is 54% (PARPA II, 2006), which translates to ten million Mozambicans trying to meet their basic human needs on an income of less than one US dollar a day (PARPA II, 2006). The major elements contributing to the vulnerability of its people are the lack of social infrastructure, poor health and sanitation, food insecurity (low levels of food production, frequent food shortages, lack of alternative sources of income, and poor access to markets), and spread of diseases, especially HIV/AIDS. Because many rural areas have undeveloped markets and su er from lack of infrastructure, the population's livelihood in those areas revolves around subsistence farming and informal production and trade. It is therefore di\u000ecult to compare social, economic and hu- man development and its impact on health in a context where there is tremendous diversity in the means of production and trade. The HIV adult prevalence in Mozambique has increased rapidly, from 13% in 1In the local Chuabo language, ogumaniha means \\united/integrated a common purpose.\" 12002 to 16% in 2006 (MISAU, 2008). The national HIV prevalence was estimated to be 13% in the latest national survey of HIV (2009), using more accurate population based sampling methods (MISAU, 2009); however, it varies signi cantly by location with rural areas and areas with limited population movement demonstrating lower prevalence. Located in central Mozambique, Zamb\u0013 ezia is a remote, underdeveloped province with rich agricultural potential but chronically vulnerable to livelihood insecurity. Health service access is extremely low: there exist only one Provincial Hospital, ve rural hospitals, 179 health centers (of which only 127 have ma- ternity services) and 153 vaccination xed posts to cater to the almost 3.8 million people living in the province. Even though the overall HIV prevalence in Zamb\u0013 ezia is estimated to be 13% (MISAU, 2009), seropositivity among pregnant women attending antenatal services in selected urban areas ranges from 14 to 35% (MISAU, 2008). The maternal mortality rate is high, at 410 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births, partly because of the remoteness of communities and lack of access to emergency care; Infant mortality is 90 out of 1,000 live births and newborn mortality is 35 out of 1,000 live births (UNICEF, 2010a). Background to Ogumaniha Survey Integral to Ogumaniha's design is a strong monitoring system and project evaluation, based on perfor- mance indicators agreed upon with USAID and the provincial government. Because the project uses multi-sectoral interventions and an interdisciplinary approach to implementation, in addition to its strong focus on poverty reduction, the consortium opted for an evaluation design that re ects these criteria. A survey instrument to be used at baseline and at project end was designed based on human development theory originated by Amartya Sen (1999) and further developed by researchers from the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Institute (OPHI). This instrument uses multiple dimensions to measure poverty including health, education, income, access to goods and services and self-empowerment. The OPHI is one of the principal contributors to the United Nation's Human Development Index (HDI), and is proposing revisions based on its methodology to improve the index (Alkire and Santos, 2010). The vision of this evaluation is that the information collected can provide a better picture to measure the impact of this large-scale intervention on the health and well being of the households in Zamb\u0013 ezia Province, so that this evaluation design can serve as a model for evaluating health and development interventions in Mozambique. The evaluation will explore the following: 1) Zamb\u0013 ezia -wide changes in selected indicators directly linked to project interventions, and 2) Changes related to project intervention intensity in the three focal districts of Namacurra, Morrumbala, and Alto Mol\u0013 ocu\u0012 e. This report will focus on Zamb\u0013 ezia-wide indicator estimates for the baseline survey. Additional analysis work on the three focus districts will be completed during year 2, and will be used for comparative analysis with information obtained from the end of the project survey in year 5. Survey Design The survey instrument was designed to achieve three objectives: \u000fTo provide baseline estimates of selected indicators that are representative of the households of the entire Zamb\u0013 ezia Province, \u000fTo provide estimates for as many project indicators as possible, where the information sought would be most appropriately collected in a population-based survey, and \u000fTo collect a su\u000ecient number of multi-dimensional indicators to be able to apply the Oxford Poverty and Human Development methodology to evaluate the medium term impact of the project. 2This report presents information only on baseline project indicators for the Zamb\u0013 ezia-wide sample. These indicator estimates are representative of the entire population of Zamb\u0013 ezia. Additional work on poverty measures will be developed and presented during the second year of the project. The survey tool was developed by a multi-disciplinary team of researchers including sta , faculty, and graduate students from Vanderbilt University and the University Eduardo Mondlane. Faculty and students involved were from the Departments of Community Medicine, Preventive Medicine, Infectious Diseases, Pediatrics, Epidemiology, Nutrition, Anthropology, Political Science and the Schools of Nursing, Educa- tion, Management, Engineering, and Divinity. The survey designers borrowed many questions and scales deemed appropriate from previous national surveys in Mozambique (including various INE surveys focus- ing on poverty and economic status) and other international surveys (DHS and MICS). The survey was made available to technical and leadership sta at World Vision and each of the consortium partners who provided feedback on questions and design. The rst part of the survey collects demographic information about all household members and includes household language and ethnicity. The second part collects child health information, including questions about vaccinations, malaria, diarrheal disease, respiratory disease, and measures of weight and height to estimate malnutrition. This set of questions was primarily selected and adapted from the Demographic and Health Survey 5 (DHS5) { Model Women's Questionnaire (DHS, 2006). The survey tool includes two instruments adapted from the Wide Range Achievement Test (WRAT-1) to measure literacy and numeracy of the interviewee (Wilkinson, 1993). Questions on education achievement and aspirations were designed based on previous instruments used in Malawi (Grant, 2008; Lockheed et al., 1989). The next section of the instrument focuses on food security, dietary diversity and food coping strategies. These questions were adapted from the Household Food Insecurity and Access Scale (HFIAS) of the Food and Nutrition Technical Assistance Project (Coates et al., 2007), as well as from Food and Agriculture Organization and other resources (FAO Nutrition and Consumer Protection Division, 2008; Tirivayi et al., 2009). The section on social barriers and social participation addresses various factors that shape well-being, from access to social support networks to decision making within the family and gender di erences. Questions in this section were selected from the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative, UNICEF and others (Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative, 2010; Buiya et al., 2007; Pulerwitz and Barker, 2007; ChildInfo, 2010). Questions on material possessions and consumption of goods were adapted from several sources based primarily on the unsatis ed basic needs approach, where the aim is to estimate use or acqui- sition of assets presumed critical for well being. Questions were included from the Demographic and Health Survey, the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey as well as from other sources (DHS, 2010; Government of South Africa, World Bank, 2007; UNICEF, 2010a). The section on reproductive health relied heavily on DHS questions, as were the sections on malaria and HIV knowledge, attitudes, and practices. Questions related to HIV/AIDS stigma were primarily adapted from the Brazilian truck driver stigma study (Population Council, 2003). The section related to quality of life were based several on WHO quality of life scales (WHO, 1997, 1998, 2002). Questions related to agency and self determination were partly adapted from the Social Support Appraisal's Scale (Vaux et al., 1986). Ques- tions about income and income generation were adapted from the Core Welfare Indicators Questionnaire (QUIBB/CWIS) survey (Wold, 2004) as well as the DHS. Agricultural practice and production questions were based on surveys previously used by World Vision and other partners in Zamb\u0013 ezia. The survey was designed to collect information about the household from the female head of household, de ned as the principal wife of the nuclear (immediate) family. The female head of household was selected to be the interviewee, because she is thought to be person likely most familiar with the health and caretak- ing of all household members, including nutrition, food procurement, cooking, water and sanitation, health events and health care access, and agricultural practices. In cases of polygamous families, the principal or eldest wife was selected, which may introduce some bias if the younger wives and their children are less 3well o . Initial revisions were done prior to eld testing in order to adapt the Portuguese version of the docu- ment to re ect the linguistic and social context of Mozambique. Field tests were then conducted in the districts of Namacurra and Quelimane to localize the questionnaire in rural and urban communities. The draft questionnaire was then revised and tested again in Alto Mol\u0013 ocu\u0012 e, Namacurra, Morrumbala, and Que- limane at district training workshops. These eld tests ensured that the way questions were phrased and the logic of the instrument worked in the eld; particular attention was paid to whether answers were best collected in categories, ranges, or scales depending on the solicited response. Field testing was conducted with the support of experienced sta from Vanderbilt's Latin American Public Opinion Project (LAPOP). Once the survey was deemed ready in Portuguese it was translated to the ve principal local languages in Zamb\u0013 ezia (INE, 2007): Nyanja, ogica de Quelimane . Further revisions were made in the local language versions in order to ensure that the versions were consistent across all languages, and eld sta members were trained by the translation team to ensure that the instruments re ected the spoken and not the formal languages. These were then back-translated to Portuguese by sta uent in those languages to verify translation accuracy. The Portuguese version was then encoded onto a software platform to enable interviewers to use mobile phones to collect survey data. Paper questionnaires were available in ve local languages. Interviewers were trained to conduct interviews in local languages reading from the paper instruments to ensure consistency of query, and entering responses into the Portuguese form on the mobile phones. Anthropometric Measures We assessed nutritional status of Zamb\u0013 ezian children under age ve using anthropometric indicators { phys- ical body measurements including height and weight along with attributes such as age and sex (O'Donnell et al., 2008). Weight-for-height (W/H) measures body weight relative to height. Weight-for-height is normally used as an indicator of current nutritional status, and can be useful for screening children at risk. Extreme cases of low W/H are commonly referred to as \\wasting\". Height-for-age (H/A) re ects cumulative linear growth. H/A de cits indicate past or chronic inadequacies nutrition and/or chronic or frequent illness. Extreme cases of low H/A, where shortness is interpreted as pathological, is referred to as \\stunting\". Weight-for-age (W/A) re ects body mass relative to age; the term \\underweight\" is com- monly used to refer to severe or pathological de cits in W/A. W/A is commonly used for monitoring growth and to assess changes in the magnitude of malnutrition over time. Anthropometric indices are constructed by comparing relevant measures with those of comparable individuals (in terms of age and sex) in the reference data (WHO child growth charts). This comparison is often expressed as a Z-score (standard deviation score): the di erence between the value for an individual and the mean value of the ref- erence population for the same age or height, divided by the standard deviation of the reference population. For this survey, we were to randomly select one child under age 12 months and one child age 13 to 59 months in selected enumeration areas to conduct anthropometric measurements. Children's measurements were carried out following WHO recommendation for children's nutritional anthropometry (WHO expert committee, 1995). All measurements were conducted by the survey team leaders, who received extensive training on measuring height and weight of children. Weight for children was measured using a Salter scale. The scales were calibrated upon arrival to each household where a child was to be measured using a 5-kg sack of sand. Children 12 months or younger were placed in a halter and weighed, whereas children over 12 months were placed upon a swing designed speci cally for the study and measured. Length/height for children was measured using altimeters designed for the study. Children 12 months or younger were measured lying down, while children over 12 months were measured standing up. This age cuto for 4measuring height/length was chosen over the more common 2 years, to make it consistent with other age speci c questions in the survey and to avoid confusion among the survey enumerators. Survey Implementation Plan Interviewers and team leaders were recruited from a pool of women with prior experience in survey work, prioritizing geographical areas where the 5 most common local languages in Zamb\u0013 ezia were spoken. Four- teen teams of 5 women were formed composed of one team leader and four interviewers. The teams were assigned by language abilities to a speci c region to work under the supervision of a regional supervisor. The team leaders were responsible for the operational side of the survey, including the following tasks: accompanying interviewers to the enumeration areas (EAs), ensuring that GPS localization was conducted upon arrival to new EA, supervising the selection of households in all EAs, assigning interviewers to se- lected households, conducting the random sampling and anthropometric measurement of children aged 0-59 months in selected EAs, backing up data, maintaining registers of data collection for each member of their team, keeping supervisors well-informed of activities, and charging phones. Data were to be collected in two phases. During phase 1, data was collected in 66 EAs representative of the Zamb\u0013 ezia Districts where Ogumaniha activities are being carried out. Phase 2, a more intensive sample of 3 large districts, was implemented to be better able to detect changes from baseline to the end of the project period. All planning, logistics, and troubleshooting were orchestrated by a survey coordinator, with the help of three regional supervisors. Interviewers were trained on general aspects of survey conduct, including: ethical behavior and con - dentiality, obtaining consent, procedures for locating the pre-selected enumeration areas, selecting a random child in the appropriate age groups for anthropometry and child health questions, scenarios requiring ter- mination of an interview, procedure to use when no eligible head of household is present, procedures to engage local political and traditional authorities to obtain authorization to conduct interviews in a given locality, etc. Training took place in various locations, over a period of 4 weeks, and included training to provide clari cation of speci c meaning and appropriateness of speci c translations used in the local language questionnaires. A lot of care was taken to ensure that local authorities at multiple levels were aware of the survey activities, providing their sanction in order to facilitate acceptance into communities and survey comple- tion. Upon arrival into each district, each of the survey teams were to present themselves to the District Administrator, to introduce the survey, produce all necessary governmental and ethical review approvals, explain the methodology, and identify the enumeration areas where they would be working. Upon arrival at each of the localities wherein the EAs were to be found, the teams further introduced themselves to the local leaders, again explaining the survey purpose. Local leaders were asked to help direct the teams towards the enumeration areas, which were often but not always tied to speci c communities. Upon arrival at the community included in the EA, the teams met with the local r\u0013 egulo , or community representative, who con rmed the team's arrival at the appropriate EA and oriented the team, along with the available maps, on the EAs limits. Data Collection and Management The survey was administered face-to-face using cell phones in the majority of cases. In cases where this was not possible, the survey was administered face-to-face using a paper questionnaire and responses later entered into the cell phone. Because the key challenge in conducting surveys digitally is to protect the data in case of since hardware failure, our questionnaire was set up to be submitted securely via the GSM 5wireless network. The interviewers and team leader were equipped with a mobile phone (HTC Tattoo) and each phone had a spare battery. Team leads were responsible for checking mobile phone battery charge and recharging batteries at the end of each day. Each team had access to both conventional wall chargers, as well as a car charger. Open Data Kit, an open source suite of tools that enables data collection on mobile phones and data submissions to a central server, was deployed with the development support of Dimagi for the survey (Dimagi, Inc., 2010). Since that mobile communications coverage in rural Zamb\u0013 ezia is incomplete, cell phones were set up with enough memory to store dozens of completed surveys, and to send data as soon as the phone detected a signal. Nonetheless, as Mozambique experienced severe shortages of cell phone coverage services due to optic cable ruptures in months preceding survey implementation, a backup system was put into place for the transfer of data from cell phones to a central location in Maputo. In Maputo, the data was uploaded to the central server and checked for errors. Sample Frame According to the 2007 census (INE, 2007), the population for Zamb\u0013 ezia is estimated at 3,794,489 living in 918,025 households which are divided into 9,073 enumeration areas (EAs). The Province of Zamb\u0013 ezia is divided into and households (7,615 EA) in the province. We col- lected two representative samples. One sample of Zamb\u0013 ezia province will allow for general estimates. A second concentrated sample in Alto Mol\u0013 ocu\u0012 e, Morrumbala, and Namacurra will allow for precise estimates and better precision of the di erence from baseline to the ve years following SCIP{Ogumaniha project start-up. These three districts make up approximately 20% of the provincial population. Sampling Methodology Sampling was conducted by the Chief Sampling Statistician from the National Statistics Institute (INE) using the Government of Mozambique sampling frame created for use on all national surveys based on 2007 census results. The random sampling was performed in four steps. First, the sampling frame was strati ed into urban and rural areas. Next, enumeration areas (EAs) were sampled for each stratum using probability proportional to size (PPS). Households within EAs were selected using simple random sampling or convenience sampling (when no aerial satellite images are available). In enumeration areas where an- thropometric measurements were conducted, with households with one or more children aged 0-12 months, one child was randomly selected for weight and height measurements. Similarly, for households with one or more children aged 13-59 months, one child was randomly selected for weight and height measurements. Step 1: Urban/ Rural/3 District Strata According to FGH speci cations, the sampling of EAs was done by the Chief Sampling Statistician and the National Institute for Statistics (INE) using the sampling frame of the 2007 census. The EAs from the master sample frame were split into four groups: urban, rural, and a concentrated 3 district sample divided into no or any planned interventions. To capture SCIP{Ogumaniha partner activity well without increasing the sample size and survey costs, FGH over-sampled within 3 districts by planned interventions at the village level; Alto Mol\u0013 ocu\u0012 e, Morrumbala, and Namacurra were selected because they represent 3 distinct geographical regions and SCIP{Ogumaniha interventions will occur in each. A design weight was constructed to compensate for the oversampling of 3 districts to generate provincially repre- sentative gures. 6Step 2: PPS Sampling of Enumeration Areas EAs were sampled with replacement from strata using probability proportional to size. EAs with a higher number of households had a proportionally greater probability of selection than those with fewer households. Step 3: Sampling of Households Instead of household listings in eld to update the sampling frame and map households, a novel tech- nique was applied for this rural environment. Aerial satellite images were acquired from eMap (eMap International, 2010). An algorithm developed by a project engineer detects rooftops of households using color thresholds from the photos (Appendix 1). Houses are marked and randomly sampled with equal probability. Teams were given maps of the EAs marked with major roads and waterways. In the event that the building identi ed is uninhabited, not residential or nonexistent, enumerators were instructed to proceed to the next closest dwelling. In cases when aerial photography was not available or inadequate, topographic maps from the National Institute of Statistics ( Instituto Nacional de Estat\u0013 \u0010stica , INE) created for enumeration for national census were used, and a \\spin the bottle\" method adopted. To improve upon the quality of the sampling, a four-quadrant approach was used. The method works as follows: \u000fDivide the EA into quadrants. \u000fChoose a central point within each quadrant of the EA; \u000fSpin a bottle (or ink pen) to select a direction in which to proceed; \u000fChoose the rst household in this direction as the starting point and then select the four nearest households. Prior research simulating vaccination coverage by Lemeshow et al. (1985) indicates that the\\spin the bottle\" method is not ideal when there are pockets of vaccinated individuals; by introducing the four quadrants, we hope that some diversity is captured and the sample will remain acceptably representative of all EA households. Step 4: Simple Random Sampling of Children In EAs where anthropometric measures were to be carried out, children ages 0-59 months were selected from participating households. Due to time constraints, we were not able to implement programming that would randomly select two children from all children aged 0-59 months. Instead a table was prepared by the project statistician listing randomly generated numbers for households with two to eleven children aged 0-12 or 13-59 months; the team lead sampled and measured up to one child 0-12 months and up to one child 13-59 months, selected based on this random number and corresponding birth order. Sample Size To measure the e ectiveness of SCIP{Ogumaniha activities while giving consideration to cost of ad- ministering the survey, we implemented a two-stage cluster sampling design. We determined the number of EAs to be selected and the number of individuals to be interviewed in each EA in order to achieve the desired precision within the survey budget (Aliago and Ruilin, 2006). The desired level of accuracy for the survey was set to a con dence level of 95%. For a con dence interval of \u00065% we needed s= 0:025. The population proportion was set conservatively to p= 0:5 which maximizes the standard error (Levy and Lemeshow, 2008). The number of households interviewed per EA is set at \u0016 n= 15; this decision was motivated by the number of enumerators and a one day per EA workload. The number of clusters ( \u0016 m) sampled was determined by the following equation (Bennet et al., 1991): \u0016m=p(1\u0000p)D s2\u0016n(1) 7WhereDis the design e ect, which quanti es the increase in the standard error of the estimate due to the sampling procedure used (Cochran, 1977; Bennet et al., 1991). The design e ect increases with the number of interviews sampled within a cluster and decreases for small intracluster correlation (ICC), D= 1 +ICC (\u0016n\u00001). Empirical data from previous DHS surveys suggested that high ICC occurs when measuring healthcare access, so we set ICC = 0:15; the design e ect was slightly larger than 3. The total sample size required was 3960 households. Alto Mol\u0013 ocu\u0012 e, Morrumbala, and Na- macurra The enumeration areas of three Zamb\u0013 ezian districts were rst divided into two interven- tion levels (0, 1 or more). Each interven- tion level had 103 EA sampled with 15 inter- views each. The sample size was calculated to achieve a precision of 4.5% in each of the two strata Probabilistic selection criteria was used through- out the 3 district sample, except at the level of the household, when random sampling was used. To ensure a representative sample of households with access to health care, we used implicit strati cation during selection of EA. Provincial districts have an average of 7 health centers and health posts and another 7 community posts (Lindelow et al., 2004). There are, however, di erences across districts in the number of community posts, with some districts having many posts and many districts having none. Ministry of Health health centers are known to be located in the center ( Sede, rst locality) of each Admin- istrative Post at a minimum. This Sede strati cation is used instead of the more traditional urban/rural strata. Because the great majority of the population in Zamb\u0013 ezia lives in rural areas, and because access to health care and other services is a key factor in the SCIP{Ogumaniha project, our sample contains approximately 30% of these areas with known health centers. Implicit selection and probability propor- tional to size sampling involves ve steps: 1) order the list of EA (sample frame) by strata (here: district then locality), 2) create a cumulative count of households for the sample frame 3) determine a sampling interval by dividing the total number of households in the frame by the desired number of EA to sample, 4) select a random number between 1 and the sampling interval as a random start and select the EA with the corresponding cumulative household count, 5) then proceed to select EAs with replacement by adding the sampling interval to the start and selecting the EA containing the cumulative household count until the desired number of EA have been identi ed. Zamb\u0013 ezia-wide To maintain a degree of generalizability across the province, a sample of households were selected for interview throughout the remaining 14 districts. Because 20% of the population is well represented in our concentrated sample of 3 districts (above), we needed fewer households from the remaining 80% of Zamb\u0013 ezia. For the remaining 14 districts, we sampled 58 EA with 15 interviews each for a total of 870 households. Sample size is based on having 15 interviews per EA and yields slightly better than 5% precision. 8Probabilistic selection criteria was used throughout the Zamb\u0013 ezia-wide sample, except at the level of the household, when random sampling was used. In order to rst provide a summary of Zamb\u0013 ezia-wide esti- mates with reasonable baseline precision (=6.5%), a random selection of 10 EA (with 15 interviews each) from the 3 district allocation were rst collected in addition to the 58 EA from the Zamb\u0013 ezia-wide allocation. Child Anthropometrics To determine the number of children 0-59 months needed for anthropometrics, we needed to select a minimum detectable di erence. A 2008 survey from USAID indicated that median Z-scores fell between -1 and -1.99 for H/A and above -1 W/H among eight Zamb\u0013 ezian districts in the MYAP program. This same survey found that 77% of Zamb\u0013 ezian households had one or more children aged 0-59 months. Because very few children fall outside of normal range for W/H in Zamb\u0013 ezia, we will only focus on improvements in H/A and W/A. We assumed equal variance from baseline to ve year sample. We wanted to be able to reject the null hypothesis that the anthropometrics are unchanged from baseline to 5 years with probability (power) 0.90 and have the Type I error probability associated with our test of this null hypothesis equal to 0.05 (Levy and Lemeshow, 2008). N=(1 +ICC (\u0016n\u00001))(Z +Z )2(2\u001b2) (\u0016X2\u0000\u0016X1)2(2) Note, the anthropometrics design e ect is smaller than the overall survey design e ect because previ- ous DHS surveys indicate low intracluster correlation for child anthropometrics, ICC = 0:07 (Aliago and Ruilin, 2006). To detect an improvement in mean z-score for H/A from -1.8 to -1.4, we will need to measure a minimum of 482 children 0-59 months with 10 HH per EA. To detect an improvement in mean z-score for W/A from -1.25 to -1 we will need to measure a minimum of 941 children 0-59 months with 10 HH per EA. If we rely on the prior USAID survey and expect 70% of Zamb\u0013 ezian households to have at least one child 0-59 months, then we plan to measure children as follows: [1] 3 districts: 37 EA will yield approximately 10 a child 0-12 or 13-59 months. [2] Zamb\u0013 ezia-wide: All 58 EA will yield approximately 10 HH with a child 0-12 or 13-59 months. In total, a minimum of 950 HH with children under ve should be considered for anthropometrics. Potential Sources of Error Quality of household survey results in resource-limited settings is limited to the clarity of survey instrument, execution of good sample selection, minimal non-response, and e ective interviews. Every e ort was taken to reduce sources for error and bias in the allotted time frame; however, it is important to acknowledge potential downfalls while interpreting survey results. The survey was developed in English and then translated to Portuguese by a native speaker from Brazil. In country, the Brazilian Portuguese version had to be modi ed to t grammar and vocabulary more commonly used in Mozambique. From the revised Portuguese survey, revisions to improve clarity and localization occurred; ve local language translations used this version. It is possible that questions remained that: 1) did not t well with the local context, 2) were not easily understood or not fully adapted to the local context, and/or 3) were incorrectly translated. The survey was programmed for electronic data capture to minimize data entry errors during the transfer of data from paper to electronic form. However, low levels of familiarity with the mobile phone technology could have created new sources of error, partic- ularly if incorrect values were entered. The lack of hard copies of completed surveys limited our ability to clean data where discrepancies appeared. 9While INE supplied the sampling weights and ArcGIS shape les for each EA, they did not provide household listings from the 2007 census. To ensure a representative sample, it is important that households are selected at random and with equal probability within the EAs. For some EAs, we were unable to obtain aerial satellite images and the \\spin the bottle\" technique was used. This technique can lead to bias when selecting only the village center; we attempted to reduce this bias through selection in four quadrants, because neighboring dwellings share similar characteristics (higher intracluster correlation). This tech- nique may also produce a greater design e ect than the original sample size calculation. Additionally, the accuracy of our algorithm-based household detection was only tested on training data and not the rural setting of Zamb\u0013 ezia. For areas with no maps, the location of the EAs was further limited by our ability to properly locate their geographic coordinates. When a head of household refused to participate in the survey, this is a case of non-response. The data may not be considered missing at random; every e ort was made to minimize and then summarize non-response. Enumerators were prepared for situations of non-response and they were instructed on how to pursue an interview at the selected household with persistence, but not coercion. Another form of non-response is refusal to answer particular survey questions which might have been sensitive in nature. To distinguish between missing data versus refusal to respond, we had two categories for no response: DK (does not know) and No Response (does not answer). Additionally, the eld testing to assess appropriate- ness of questions to the local context removed questions that may be overly sensitive in nature. Extensive training on administering the questionnaires and using electronic data entry took place in 3 districts. Survey team leads were responsible for monitoring the location and administration of interviews. Use of local language translations were heavily dependent on the enumerator's reading ability, and on the appropriate literacy level of the translated versions. 10Results 1 Data Collection and Survey Response Data collection was carried out between 8 August and 25 September, 2010. There were 930 surveys completed in 66 of the 68 Phase I of data collection across 14 districts in Zamb\u0013 ezia. For Phase II, a total of 2869 surveys were completed in 193 enumeration areas. While we had hoped to collect data for all Phase I areas rst, and then proceed into the EAs for Phase II, logistic constraints including road navigability forced us to modify the data collection schedule slightly. We completed those Phase I areas rst whenever feasible, collecting data from Phase II areas only in those cases where the Phase I areas were not accessible, in order to maximize the e\u000eciency of data collection in the eld and to not leave data collectors idle. The table below captures the total numbers of EAs completed, households surveyed, and children measured in each of the survey phases. Only two enumeration areas in the entire survey were not completed. One enumeration area was 35 kilometers from the nearest road, with the main bridge out of service and the only alternate mode of transportation available, upon crossing the makeshift temporary bridge, was by bicycle. The second EA could not be identi ed based on information provided by INE, and no maps were available. Table 1: Survey Collection Total EAs Total Households Child Anthropometrics Phase Planned Completed Databased Planned Completed Databased Planned Completed Databased Phase I 68 66 66 1020 989 930 680 834 Phase II 196 196 193 2940 2927 2869 270 365 462 Satellite maps of the enumeration areas were only found to be useful in the three EAs surveyed in the city of Quelimane, where landmarks were easily identi able and homes not too disperse. Of the remaining 65 EAs in Phase I, 58 had topographic maps from the National Institute of Statistics available, which were used, were useful to help delineate the EAs, with the help of the local community leaders. For the 7 EAs in Phase I where no maps were available, several additional steps were taken by the teams to localize themselves and randomly select households for survey participation. \u000fDuring the introduction of the survey to the District Administrator, survey teams asked for copies of any maps or graphical representations of areas that could help in the identi cation of the area selected for data collection \u000fDetails of the descriptive names of the EAs were used to help narrow down the location: district, administrative post, locality, population area ( povoado ), and village \u000fUpon arrival at the locality of the EA selected, local leaders were asked whether any graphical infor- mation, including community maps, were available for the area of interest \u000fOnce the team arrived in the population area and/or village, the team requested the r\u0013 egulo to accompany the team to the area, in order to identify the area and its borders. Points of reference, such as roads, rivers, schools and others that could help identify the area to be covered. Following the identi cation of the EA borders, the team divided the area into four quadrants. Starting in one quadrant, the team would split up, and then followed the protocols for household selection where only topographic maps were available. There are 930 Zamb\u0013 ezia-wide surveys completed in 66 EA and 14 districts with a median interview time of 92 minutes. Zamb\u0013 ezia-wide survey interviews were conducted during 29 days yielding approximately 32 interviews per day. Participation rate was 99.0%., very few surveys were not completed, and only one household was dropped because no one was at home after two visits by the interviewer. See table 2. 11Figure 1: Selected Enumeration Areas (a) Zamb\u0013 ezia-wide Sample Coverage (b) 3 District Sample Coverage 12Table 2: Survey Response Zamb\u0013 ezia-wide Household Located, n(%) House location con rmed 930 (100.0%) Survey Completion Status, n(%) Participant quits 1 (0.1%) Other, survey incomplete 8 (0.9%) Survey completed 921 (99.0%) Length of interview (minutes)a91.7 (68, 132.8) aContinuous variables are reported as medians (in- terquartile range).

This report covers the analysis of general estimates of the Ogumaniha project indicators. It is based on the data collected during phase I based on a sample representative of all Zamb\u0013 ezia households. A series of analyses focusing on speci c questions relevant to the project will be carried out and published by June 2011. These analyzes will be informed by consultation with government and consortium partners that will be carried out during the data dissemination meetings. 2 Demographics Tables 4 and 5 gives summary demographic information of the female respondent and household. The median age (interquartile range, IQR) of survey respondents was 30 (23, 37), ranging in age from 16 to 80 years. Most (53.7%) were o\u000ecially married or in a common law relationship (20.7%). The years of formal education was low, with a median (IQR) 2 (0, 4) years of completed education, and a range of 0 to 12 years. A majority felt they were not uent in Portuguese (59.7%). 13Table 4: Basic Demographics: Female Head of Household Zamb\u0013 ezia-wide Agea(n=838) 30 (23, Marital Married 4.9% No 0.1% Education (years)a(n=930) 2 (0, 4) Fluent in Portugueseb(n=930) No 59.7% Yes 38.3% No response 2.0% aContinuous variables are reported as weighted estimates of median (interquartile range), with each observation being weighted by the inverse of the household sampling probability. bCategorical variables are reported as weighted percentages, with each observation being weighted by the inverse of the household sampling probability. The median (IQR) household size was 5 (3, 6) members, ranging in size from 1 to 15. Surveys were conducted in Elomwe, Echuabo, Portuguese, Cinyanja, and Cisena, in order of volume. There was a small proportion of Makhuwa households (1.6%) that were interviewed in other languages they spoke, and a sizable proportion of `other' reported ethnicities (17.9%). Three quarters of households had at least one child under the age of ve, but some as many as 5. By comparison the results of the Multiple Indicator Survey found that 54% of households in Zamb\u0013 ezia had at least one child under 5 years of age (MICS, 2008). Most households self-identi ed their religion as Catholic (44.3%), although there were various other religions. The median (IQR) length of residency in the current location was 5 (3, 14) years. See table 5. 14Table 5: Basic Demographics: Household Zamb\u0013 ezia-wide Household sizea(n=930) age 5a(n=930) 1 (0, 2) Any child under age 5 74.7% Religionb(n=930) Agnostic or atheist 0.9% Catholic 10.9% Evangelical Pentecostal 14.7% Traditional Religions 1.0% Non Christian Eastern 1.6% Spiritual (no speci c denomination) 6.0% No response 5.4% Do not know 1.1% Length of residency (years)a(n=925) 5 (3, 14) Roo No response 2.3% aContinuous variables are reported as weighted estimates of median (interquartile range), with each observation being weighted by the inverse of the household sampling probability. bCategorical variables are reported as weighted percentages, with each observation being weighted by the inverse of the household sampling probability. cPercentages may sum to greater than 100%. Table 6 summarizes past assistance received by any household. The vast majority of households in- terviewed did not report receiving any assistance from Ogumaniha partners or from prior USAID-funded projects. While 18.8% of households reported having orphans, very few reported ever receiving any assis- tance from OVC programs; of households speci cally reporting having at least one orphan residing with 15them, only 2.2% percent ever received assistance through OVC activities, but 4.0% of the total households reported ever receiving OVC assistance. It is possible that OVC assistance was provided to households without any OVC, or that some households had OVC residing at one point but not at the time of the survey..

Tables 10 and 12 summarize data related to contraception. Tables 14{21 provide data on child health for households with children aged 0-59 months. Tables 14{17 give information on the immunization of children according to schedules for children at 1 month, under 4 months, 12 to 23 months, and 13 to 59 months of age. Tables 18{20 show measures of child health for all children aged 0-59 months, children aged 0-12 months and children aged 13-59 months. Table 21 demonstrates the caregiver health-seeking practices and knowledge in households with children under age 5. Table 22 gives summary information on malaria incidence and prevention. Tables 23 and 24 summarize information on HIV-related health services and on HIV knowl- edge. Table 25 examines health care utilization and satisfaction. 3.1 Antenatal care, pregnancy and delivery Of those interviewees who have had a child, a majority (58.2%) had visited a health facility for antenatal care at some point during their last pregnancy. Among them, 11.1% had visited a health facility once, 11.3% twice, 21.3% three times, 15.0% four times, and 41.1% ve or more times. Of those who had visited a health facility, 87.0% reported having received good treatment by the clinic sta . Over ninety (92.8%) percent of women who had visited a health facility for antenatal care during their last pregnancy delivered their baby at a health facility, with 82.7% of them reporting having received good care at delivery. Of those who delivered at a health facility, 85.2% reported they would return for care and delivery during their next pregnancy. Among all women with live births in the last 5 years, 57.9% (Zamb\u0013 ezia) and 84% (nationally) had at least one antenatal care visit (DHS, 2003), which indicates no increase in this indicator since 2003. See table 7. Of those interviewees who have had a child, 12.2% received the full package of antenatal services, including fansidar, tetanus toxoid, vitamin A (post-partum), iron, a bednet, and CT. Of those who had visited a health facility, this proportion of women who received the full package of antenatal services increases to 19.5%. 17Table 7: Antenatal Care 95% CI antenatal during last pregnancyb(n=857) No 37.9% (32.1, 43.7) Yes 58.2% (52.2, 64.2) Do not know 2.1% (0.9, 3.3) No response 1.8% (0.8, 2.7) Among women who visited a health facility during last pregnancy (n=508): Number of health facility visits for antenatal careb(n=493) 1 11.1% (5.9, 16.2) 2 11.3% (8.5, 14.1) 3 21.3% (16.4, 26.2) 4 15.0% (11.3, 18.6) 5 or more 41.1% (34.7, 47.4) No response 0.4% (0.0, 0.9) Received good treatment for antenatal care at health facilityb(n=508) No 8.5% (5.1, 11.9) Yes 87.0% (83.3, 90.7) Do not know 0.8% (0.0, 1.6) No response 3.7% (1.5, 5.8) Delivery performed in a health facilityb(n=508) No 7.2% (4.4, 10.0) Yes 92.8% (90.0, 95.6) Received good treatment for last delivery performed in a health facilityb(n=508) No 10.2% (6.7, 13.6) Yes 82.7% (78.5, 86.8) Do not know 0.9% (0.2, 1.7) No response 6.2% (3.8, 8.7) Willing to return to health facility for next birthb(n=508) No 7.8% (4.9, 10.7) Yes 85.2% (81.6, 88.7) Do not know 4.2% (2.3, 6.1) No response 2.8% (1.3, 4.4) bCategorical variables are reported as weighted percentages, with each observation being weighted by the inverse of the household sampling probability.

The 95% con dence intervals include precision estimates that incorporate the e ects of strati cation and clustering. Regarding antenatal and delivery services, 61.4% of all eligible women were vaccinated against tetanus during their last pregnancy, which is very close to the gures reporting having visited a health facility. Of those vaccinated, 35.8% were vaccinated twice, and 27.2% were vaccinated more than twice, indicating good coverage for anti-tetanus vaccine. During their last pregnancy, 55.9% of all women received iron supplements, 46.1% received any fansidar, 31.0% received a mosquito net, and 49.0% received vitamin A supplements,. According to the DHS (2003), of all women with live births in the last 5 years, 75.7% (na- tionally) and 54.1% (in Zamb\u0013 ezia) received at least one tetanus vaccination dose. This indicates a modest increase in tetanus vaccine rates in Zamb\u0013 ezia since 2003. A quarter (26.1%) of respondents were o ered 19HIV counseling and testing during their last pregnancy. Almost eight percent (8.2%) of the respondents were pregnant at the time of the survey, and 60.5% of these had visited a health facility for antenatal care. See table 8. Among those who ever breastfed their youngest child, nearly all women breastfed the child on the day of their birth with 74.2% immediately following birth, and 89.4% of those who breastfed actually gave the baby the rst mother's milk. By comparison, in the 2008 MICS report, 85.2% of Zamb\u0013 ezian mothers breastfed their baby within the rst day and 62.3% within the rst hour (MICS, 2008). Interestingly, the median (IQR) length of time the child was breastfed is 4 (3, 6) months, and mothers reported introducing solid foods in the baby's diet at a median (IQR) of 5 (4, 6) months.

Among women not currently 20pregnant, 44.9% percent reported that they would be unhappy should they nd themselves pregnant in a short period. Close to three quarters of women had never used a form of contraception. The overall proportion of women reporting ever having used any method of modern contraception was 22.6%.

The 95% con dence intervals include precision estimates that incorporate the e ects of strati cation and clustering. 3.3 Contraception Of all women interviewed, 12.8% reported currently using any modern contraceptive method. Of the women who had ever used any method, 42.1% reported currently using any modern contraceptive. The most commonly used modern methods among women reporting current use were: contraceptive injections (34.5%), natural (traditional) method (16.7%) and contraceptive pill (18.7%). Current usage of condom (7.8%), rhythm method (6.5%), and female condom (2.9%) were low. Prevalence of current use for other methods such as IUD (2.4%), sterilization (0.9%), and coitus interruptus (4.8%) were very low. Contraception prevalence among women surveyed in this population are quite low. There appears to be little, if any, increase in the utilization of contraceptives among Zamb\u0013 ezian women between 2003 and 2010. The Mozambique Demographic and Health Survey of 2003 reports that the national rate of use of any modern contraceptive was 18.2%, whereas that of Zamb\u0013 ezia was 11%; this is in agreement with the proportion in the current survey (DHS, 2003). The rates of current contraceptive use in Zamb\u0013 ezia, among women married or living in common union were reported in the DHS 2003 as follows: 4.8% contraceptive injection, 3.5% contraceptive pill, 0.9% sterilization, 95% CI Among all female respondents (n=930): Currently using ANY modern contraceptive 12.8% (9.6, 16.0) Use natural (traditional) method 3.8% (2.2, 5.3) 4.9% (3.0, 6.7) Use condom 1.8% (0.7, 2.8) 3.4% (1.5, 5.3) Use contraceptive pill 4.3% (2.8, 5.9) 9.0% (6.4, 11.6) Use IUD 0.5% (0.0, 1.1) 0.5% (0.0, 1.0) Use coitus interruptus 1.2% (0.4, 2.0) 1.5% (0.7, 2.4) Use contraceptive injection 8.0% (5.8, 10.2) 10.4% (7.6, 13.2) Use rhythm method 1.6% (0.6, 2.7) 3.5% (2.1, 4.9) Use female condom 0.7% (0.2, 1.2) 0.8% (0.2, 1.3) Sterilization 0.2% (0.0, 0.5) bCategorical variables are reported as weighted percentages, with each observation being weighted by the in- verse of the household sampling probability.

At birth, children should receive TB (BCG) and the rst dose of oral polio vaccine (OPV). By age 4 months they should have received the next three vaccination doses for Diptheria, Pertussis, Tetanus (DPT), Hepatitis B, and Polio (DPT+HepB+OPV). By age 9 months they should have also received the measles vaccine. Tables 14{17 describe vaccination rates for Zamb\u0013 ezian children at four age groups, to assess how closely to schedule children are receiving vaccines. Table 13: Vaccination Schedule in Mozambique Vaccination for InfantsxWomen of child bearing age (15{49 years)x Age Visit Antigen Visit Interval Antigen Birth 1 BCG, OPV0 1 0 (as early as possible) TT1 6 weeks 2 DTP-HepB1, OPV1 2 4 weeks TT2 10 weeks 3 DTP-HepB2, OPV2 3 6 weeks TT3 14 weeks 4 DTP-HepB3, OPV3 4 1 year or subsequent pregnancy TT4 9 months 5 Measles 5 1 year or subsequent pregnancy TT5 6-59 months Vitamin A Supplement All post-natal mothers Vitamin A Supplement xSource: MOH, EPI unit (The Government of Mozambique Ministry of Health: Expanded Programme on Immunization) Comprehensive Multi-Year Plan (2007-2009). Overall, 64.7% of children 0{59 months presented a vaccination card. For those without a vaccination card, we used the mother's report of vaccine coverage. Figures in table 14 show that 62.1% of children one month or younger had a vaccination card. Of those, 80.1% were up-to-date with vaccination having received both BCG and OPV. Of those children without a card, 31.1% reported receiving both BCG and OPV. Therefore, an estimated 61.5% of children up to one month of age were on schedule with vaccinations. 23Table 14: Immunization of Children Aged 1 Month Zamb\u0013 ezia-wide 95% CI Head of household presents an immunization card (n=126) 62.1% (51.5, 72.8) BCG immunization record (n=76) Dose 1 99.5) record (n=76) immunization bCategorical variables are reported as weighted percentages, with each observation being weighted by the inverse of the child sampling probability. The 95% con dence intervals include precision estimates that incorporate the e ects of strati cation and clustering. Table 15 summarizes vaccination coverage for children age 4 to 12 months old; 79.9% presented a vaccination card. Of those, only 36.2% were up-to-date in their vaccinations. Among those not presenting a vaccination card,20.9% reported having received BCG+polio+DPT+HepB. The estimated proportion of children 4-9 months old who are up-to-date with vaccines is 33.1%. Because we did not collect speci c timing and number of doses among those reporting without a vaccine card, this may be result in overestimation of overall vaccination coverage. Table 15: Immunization of Children Aged 4 to 9 Months Zamb\u0013 ezia-wide 95% CI Head of household presents an (n=107) 79.9% (69.1, 90.7) BCG immunization record Polio immunization record (n=85) 1 84.6% DPT+HepB immunization Dose 1 72.4% (59.6, 85.1) Dose 2 52.7% (38.7, 66.6) Dose 3 42.9% (30.6, 55.2) Immunizations up-to-date (from card) (n=85) 36.2% (24.2, 48.2) No immunization card (n=107) 20.1% Immunizations up-to-date (no immunizations (n=107) 33.1% (22.6, 43.7) bCategorical variables are reported as weighted percentages, with each observation being weighted by the inverse of the child sampling probability. The 95% con dence intervals include precision estimates that incorporate the e ects of strati cation and clustering. Table 16 shows coverage for children 13-23 months, to enable comparisons with results from previous surveys such as DHS and MICS. In the 12{23 months age group, 77.6% of those interviewed were able to present a vaccination card for children in this age group. Of those presenting a card, 58.5% have documen- tation of being fully immunized (documented full series of antigen), and 28.7% has received at least one dose of vitamin A. Of those children without a vaccination card, 43.9% reported having received all the 24di erent vaccines (BCG+Polio+DPT+HepB+Measles). The overall estimate of children 12{23 months old who are fully immunized is 55.3%. 3 Table 16: Immunization of Children Aged 12 to 23 Months Zamb\u0013 ezia-wide 95% CI Head of household presents an immunization card (n=100) 77.6% (67.7, 87.5) BCG immunization record (n=76) Dose 1 92.8% (86.5, 99.1) Polio immunization record (n=76) 1 87.8% Dose 2 83.1% Measles (n=76) 88.8) Fully immunized (from card) (n=76) 58.5% (43.5, 73.5) Vitamin A Dose (from card)b(n=76) No 28.7% (17.4, 39.9) Yes 71.3% (60.1, 82.6) No immunization card (n=100) 22.4% (12.5, 32.3) Reported vaccination (no without card (BCG+Polio+DPT+HepB+Measles) (n=24) 43.9% (21.6, 66.3) fully immunized (n=100) 55.3% (42.2, 68.3) bCategorical variables are reported as weighted percentages, with each observation being weighted by the inverse of the child sampling probability. The 95% con dence intervals include precision estimates that incorporate the e ects of strati cation and clustering. Table 17 shows vaccination coverage estimates for children 13 to 59 months of age; at this point, all scheduled vaccination series should be complete. In this age group, 59.5% of those interviewed were able to present a vaccination card for children in this age group. Of those presenting a card, 64.0% have doc- umentation of being fully immunized (documented full series of antigen), and 28.8% has received at least one dose of vitamin A. Of those children without a vaccination card, 46.2% reported having received all the di erent vaccines (BCG+Polio+DPT+HepB+Measles). The overall estimate of children 13-59 months old who are fully immunized is 56.8%. By age 24 months, all children should have received all their scheduled vaccines. Subsetting to the 13{59 months age group as opposed to the 13{23 months age group, yields a larger sample (n=424 vs. n=100), but may potentially decrease vaccination report (for those without cards) owing to recall bias. Because we did not collect speci c timing and number of doses among those reporting without a vaccine card, this may result in overestimation of overall vaccination coverage. By comparison, DHS reports that nationally 63.3% (60.0% with card, and 3.2% via mother's report) of children 13{23 months of age were fully vaccinated, which they de ne as BCG, measles, and three doses of triple vaccine (DPT) and polio. The corresponding reported gure for Zamb\u0013 ezia was 44.7%. According to the 2008 MICS survey, in Zamb\u0013 ezia among children 13{23 months of age, 75.4% had a vaccination card, 25and based on both vaccination card and mother's report, 46.8% of children had been fully vaccinated (BCG + all polio + all DPT + measles) (MICS, 2008). Our survey nds the proportion of children with cards that are fully vaccinated is slightly lower than these and perhaps overestimates the proportion for those without cards that are fully vaccinated. Nonetheless this survey indicates that in Zamb\u0013 ezia, the proportion of children fully vaccinated as evidenced by vaccination cards remains in the low range of 40-45%.

Of all children under 5 years of age in the interviewed households, 56.2% had fever in the 30 days preceding the survey, 35.9% diarrhea, 34.0% had cough and 20.9% rapid or shallow breathing during the 30 days prior to the survey. There were no apparent di erences in the reporting of these symptoms between children under 12 months as compared to those 13 to 59 months. Mothers reporting these symptoms largely reported also seeking advice or treatment, and doing so at health facilities primarily. Very small percentages indicated seeking advice or treatment from traditional healers. Of note, 100% of mothers reporting diarrhea in their children in the past 30 days sought advice or treatment for the child, and the great majority in health centers. Also, very high percentages (over 80%) reported using oral rehydration therapy to treat their child's diarrhea. Less than half (43.4% of children under 5 years, 41.6% of children under 12 months) had slept under a insecticide treated bednet during the previous night. 26Table 18: Health Indicators of Children Aged 0-59 Months Zamb\u0013 ezia-wide 95% CI Head of household presents an immunization card (n=834) 64.7% (58.3, 71.1) Child ill with fever in month (n=834) No 42.7% (38.7, 46.7) Yes 56.2% (52.2, 60.3) Do not know 0.6% (0.0, 1.2) No response 0.4% (0.0, 0.9) Sought advice or treatment for the fever (n=465) 72.9% (67.4, 78.3) Source of advice or treatment for the fever (n=465) Family member 0.6% (0.0, 1.3) Other 2.9% (1.3, 4.5) Pharmacy 0.8% (0.0, 1.7) Traditional healer 1.8% (0.4, 3.1) No response 27.7% (22.2, 33.2) Health facility 66.2% (59.4, 73.1) Child ill with diarrhea in the last month (n=834) No 63.4% (59.0, 67.7) Yes 35.9% (31.6, 40.2) Do not know 0.6% (0.0, 1.2) No response 0.1% (0.0, 0.3) Sought advice or treatment for the diarrhea (n=197) 100.0% (100.0, 100.0) Source of advice or treatment for diarrhea (n=197) Health facility 86.1% (80.7, 91.6) Pharmacy 4.4% (0.7, 8.0) No response 1.0% (0.0, 2.4) Traditional healer 4.0% (0.1, 7.9) Other 2.9% (0.8, 5.1) Family member 1.6% (0.0, 3.7) Treatment received for the diarrhea (n=197) Food 2.9% (0.0, 5.8) Oral Rehydration therapy 78.6% (71.4, 85.7) Traditional remedy 5.5% (1.2, 9.7) Other 10.6% (5.6, 15.5) Do not know 1.4% (0.0, 3.5) No response 1.1% (0.0, 2.6) Child had cough or di\u000eculty breathing in last month (n=826) 34.0% (29.4, 38.5) Child had fast or shallow breathing in last month (n=817) 20.9% (17.1, 24.7) Sought advice for breathing problem (n=134) 82.2% (73.4, 91.0) Child taken to health facility for problem (n=135) 68.6% (58.4, 78.9) Slept under 55.2% 43.4% (36.6, 50.2) Do not know 1.1% (0.2, 1.9) No response 0.3% (0.0, 0.7) bCategorical variables are reported as weighted percentages, with each observation being weighted by the inverse of the household sampling probability.

Table 21 summarizes responses regarding head of household knowledge of child health issues. Most women report knowing the most common places to get vaccinations for their children, naming health facilities, and sometimes school and health brigades. A large proportion of the women are aware that vaccinations help their children grow healthy (20.4%) or protect them from illness (61.9%), but a sizable proportion do not know the purpose of vaccination (12.8%). Even though the majority of women had heard of a product available locally to treat diarrhea, a signi cant proportion (18.6%) had not; a third of women felt that children with diarrhea should be given less uids. Women were asked to name as many examples as they could of situations for which their child would require immediate medical attention. The following responses were counted as correct: fever, cannot drink water, breastfeed or eat, coughing and rapid or di\u000ecult breathing, blood in stool, or convulsions. Only a small proportion of women interviewed were able to provide more than two correct responses (9.2%); more named one correct instance (31.9%) than two correct instances (30.5%). 29Table 21: Child Health Practices/Knowledge in Households with 0-59 Months Zamb\u0013 ezia-wide 95% CI Locations identi ed vaccination, needed (n=924)c Hospital 85.1% (81.8, 88.4) Health facility 26.7% (21.6, 31.7) School 18.3% (14.8, 21.9) Mobile brigade 9.6% (6.9, 12.3) Church 1.1% (0.3, 1.9) Traditional Healer 0.6% (0.2, 1.1) Outreach sites 1.0% (0.1, 1.8) Other 1.2% (0.4, 2.0) Do not know 4.6% (2.8, 6.3) Reason for vaccinating childrenb(n=924) Heal them 3.1% (1.9, 4.4) Help them grow healthy 20.4% (17.3, 23.4) Protect from illness 61.9% (58.1, 65.8) Other 0.3% (0.0, 0.7) Do not know 12.8% (10.0, 15.6) No response 1.4% (0.7, 2.2) Give children with diarrhea more or less uid?b(n=924) More 32.3% (27.7, 37.0) Same 13.5% (10.8, 16.3) Less 38.5% (34.2, 42.8) No response 15.6% (12.5, 18.8) Heard of product available locally to treat diarrheab(n=924) No 18.6% (13.7, 23.5) Yes 67.3% (61.6, 73.0) Do not know 3.1% (1.8, 4.4) No response 11.0% (8.7, 13.3) Knowledge of when a child needs immediate medical attentionb(n=924) No correct 14.1% (11.3, 16.9) One correct 31.9% (28.3, 35.5) Two correct 30.5% (27.2, 33.8) More than two correct 9.2% (6.7, 11.8) Do not know 4.2% (2.1, 6.3) No response 10.1% (7.9, 12.3) bCategorical variables are reported as weighted percentages, with each observation being weighted by the inverse of the child sampling probability.

A majority of respondents reported having had malaria either currently (9.7%), recently (34.4%) or in the more distant past (28.7%). Among those reporting having had malaria the median (IQR) time since they last had it was 3 (1, 24) months, ranging from 0 to 288 months. Over a third of household respondents (35.7%) reported having a bednet for each and every sleeping mat or bed, while 23.5% reported they did not have enough nets for all of the sleeping mats or beds. The median (IQR) number of nets that were purchased per household was 1 (0, 2), and the median (IQR) number of nets donated was 1 (0, 2). Sleeping under a net the night prior to the survey administration was reported by 43.2% of respondents. Of those women who had been pregnant, 47.5% reported having slept under a net during the last pregnancy while nearly half (48.9%) had not. 30Table 22: Malaria Occurrence and Prevention Zamb\u0013 95% CI Fell ill with malariab(n=930) No 23.8% (20.3, 27.4) Yes now 9.7% (7.7, 11.6) Yes recently 34.4% (30.7, 38.2) Yes past 28.7% (25.3, 32.1) Do not know 1.8% (0.6, 3.1) No response 1.5% (0.6, 2.5) If ever had malaria, duration since last infection (months)a(n=679) 3 (1, 24) Inventory of household mosquito netsb(n=930) None 33.5% (28.2, 38.7) Less than the number of beds/sleeping mats 23.5% (18.6, 28.3) One for every bed/sleeping mat 35.7% (31.8, 39.6) More than the number of beds/sleeping mats 4.2% (2.6, 5.7) Do not know 1.2% (0.1, 2.3) No response 2.0% (0.9, 3.2) Number of mosquito nets purchaseda(n=600) 1 (0, 2) Number of mosquito nets donateda(n=608) 1 (0, 2) Respondent slept under mosquito net previous nightb(n=930) No 54.6% (48.8, 60.4) Yes 43.2% (37.4, 49.0) Do not know 0.6% (0.0, 1.2) No response 1.6% (0.5, 2.8) During last pregnancy, respondent slept under mosquito netb(n=857) No 48.9% (43.7, 54.2) Yes 47.5% (42.1, 52.9) Do not know 0.6% (0.1, 1.2) No response 2.9% (1.4, 4.3) aContinuous variables are reported as weighted estimates of median (interquartile range), with each observation being weighted by the inverse of the household sampling probability. bCategorical variables are reported as weighted percentages, with each observation being weighted by the inverse of the child sampling probability.

Among those who knew about CT and ART services, the large majority knew the services can be obtained in hospitals and in some cases other health facilities. Schools (6.6%) and churches (4.6%) were in some instances reported as places that o er CT services, and in smaller percentages provide ART services. Of those who know about CT services, 35.0% had received CT in the past six months and 30.7% had received CT services prior to the past 6 months. Most of those receiving CT had received their results (71.4% of those receiving service in the last six months and 79.4% of receiving service before the last six months). The majority of respondents knowledgeable of ART believed that ART can help HIV+ people be health- ier (71.3%), but a sizable proportion did not believe it (14.3%), and many said they did not know (14.4%). A very small percent of respondents who know about ART services (1.1%) indicated that traditional healers also provide ART services, while 23.0% reported that traditional healers can help people with HIV. 31Table 23: HIV Services Zamb\u0013 ezia-wide 95% CI testing servicesb(n=930) No 54.3% (48.0, 60.5) Yes 39.9% (33.6, 46.2) Do not know 4.6% (3.1, 6.1) No response 1.2% (0.5, 1.9) Among respondents who know of CT: Locations identi ed to receive CT (n=378)c Hospital 86.6) Health facility 24.9% (19.5, 30.3) School 6.6% (3.5, 9.6) Church 4.6% (1.3, 8.0) Traditional Healer 0.8% (0.0, 1.6) Do not know 0.7% (0.0, 1.7) Received CT in past 6 monthsb(n=378) No 63.9% (57.6, 70.2) Yes 35.0% (28.6, 41.3) Do not know 0.2% (0.0, 0.6) No response 0.9% (0.0, 1.8) Received CT result (n=123) 71.4% (63.5, 79.2) Received CT prior to past 6 monthsb(n=378) No 67.5% (61.5, 73.5) Yes 30.7% (24.6, 36.8) Do not know 0.4% (0.0, 1.0) No response 1.4% (0.2, 2.5) Received CT result (n=112) 79.4% (69.0, 89.8) Believes it is worthwhile to test and know HIV statusb(n=378) No 21.2% (15.3, 27.1) Yes 68.1% (61.7, 74.5) Do not know 8.3% (5.3, 11.3) No response 2.4% (0.6, 4.3) Knows that HIV can be treatedb(n=930) No 48.6% (43.5, 53.6) Yes 38.7% (33.0, 44.4) Do not know 11.5% (8.7, 14.2) No response 1.3% (0.3, 2.3) Among respondents who know of ART: Locations identi ed to receive ART (n=358)c Hospital 89.0) Health facility 27.7% (21.0, 34.5) 3.9) Church 0.8% (0.0, 1.7) Traditional Healer 1.1% (0.2, 2.1) Other 0.3% (0.0, 0.9) Do not know 1.1% (0.1, 2.0) ART helps people with HIV to be healthierb(n=358) No 14.3% (9.2, 19.3) Yes 71.3% (64.2, 78.4) Do not know 14.4% (9.9, 18.9) Traditional healers can help people with HIVb(n=358) No 62.4% (56.3, 68.6) Yes 23.0% (17.6, 28.4) Do not know 12.8% (8.4, 17.2) No response 1.7% (0.1, 3.3) bCategorical variables are reported as weighted percentages, with each observation being weighted by the inverse of the child sampling probability.

Re- spondents were asked about knowledge of transmission and modes of prevention between adults and from mother to child. The following responses were marked as correct, when respondent mentioned the subject, as the interviewers were instructed not to read the answers. Transmission between adults: \u000fanal, vaginal or oral sex without protection, \u000fdirect contact with blood or other body uids, \u000fneedle sharing, \u000funsafe blood transfusions, \u000fand accidents in hospital or health care setting. Transmission from mother to child: \u000fbefore childbirth or during childbirth, \u000fthrough breast milk, if and does not re- ceive ART.Prevention between adults: \u000fusing condoms, prophylactics or other protection made of latex, \u000fabstaining from sex or delaying debut, \u000fhaving only one sexual partner after knowing both partners are healthy Prevention of mother-to-child transmission: \u000fprevention of infection in the future parents, \u000favoiding pregnancy when mother is HIV+, \u000fusing ART during pregnancy, \u000fusing ART for the new born child, \u000fusing safe practices for infant feeding instead of breastfeeding. Respondents gave one correct response in 33.5% (adult transmission), 35.0% (adult prevention), 35.3% (mother-to-child transmission), and 24.3% (mother-to-child transmission prevention) of the cases. Percent- ages fell under 20% for two correct responses, and around half did not know or did not respond to the question. Respondents were asked their perceived chance of becoming infected with HIV. Of all respondents, 20.5% believed they had no chance, 17.9% responded a small chance of getting infected, while 5.4% believed they had a good chance and 1.5% reported being infected. Of note 48.1% and 6.8% did not know and did not want to respond to this question, respectively. Finally, 61.7% of respondents knew that there is no cure for AIDS, contrasting with 8.1% who believed there is a cure; over one quarter (26.7%) of participants responded that they did not know. 33Table 24: HIV Knowledge Zamb\u0013 ezia-wide 95% CI When questioned how one adult man or woman can transmit HIVb(n=930) No response 3.6% (2.0, 5.3) One correct response 33.5% (30.3, 36.8) Two correct responses 20.4% (16.0, 24.7) None 23.0% (19.6, 26.3) Do not know 19.5% (15.4, 23.6) When questioned how to prevent HIV transmissionb(n=930) No response 5.7% (3.6, 7.7) One correct response 35.0% (31.0, 38.9) Two correct responses 13.6% (10.7, 16.5) None 25.3% (21.5, 29.1) Do not know 20.4% (16.5, 24.4) When questioned how a mother can transmit HIVb(n=930) No response 4.1% (2.3, 5.9) One correct response 35.3% (30.8, 39.7) Two correct responses 12.0% (9.2, 14.8) None 25.9% (22.2, 29.5) Do not know 22.7% (19.1, 26.4) When questioned how to prevent HIV transmission from mother to childb(n=930) No response 6.2% (4.2, 8.2) One correct response 24.3% (21.3, 27.4) Two correct responses 14.7% (11.4, 18.0) None 27.0% (23.8, 30.2) Do not know 27.7% (23.7, 31.7) Chance that respondent will become infected with HIVb(n=930) No chance 20.5% (16.4, 24.5) Small chance 17.9% (13.9, 21.9) Good chance 5.4% (3.8, 6.9) Already infected 1.5% (0.6, 2.4) Do not know 48.1% (43.0, 53.1) No response 6.8% (4.6, 8.9) Believes AIDS has a cureb(n=930) No 61.7% (57.6, 65.9) Yes 8.1% (5.9, 10.3) Do not know 26.7% (22.9, 30.5) No response 3.4% (2.2, 4.7) bCategorical variables are reported as weighted percentages, with each observation being weighted by the inverse of the child sampling probability.

Respondents were asked if they had EVER used various venues for health care. Of all respondents, 71.6% reported having ever visited a government health facility for a health problem, 20.4% reported having used a private or local pharmacy to deal with a health problem and 45.1% reported having used a traditional healer to address a health problem. Among those who had visited a health facility, the median (IQR) time since the last visit was 2 (1, 3) months (range: 0{60 months), 85.3% were satis ed with the care provided, 84.5% reported that their health problem improved, 87.6% reported the health facility was clean, and 93.2% would return to the health facility for care.

The most frequently reported drinking water sources include wells (58.8%), rivers (21.9%), and public faucets (17.3%). Only (4.6%) of households are reported to use their own faucet for drinking water. Sources of cooking water generally follow the same distribution of those reported for drinking water. Water used for washing was similar with the exception that the number of respondents using river water for washing is greater (41.7%). The vast majority of households did not report treating drinking water (83.0%). In addition, of these 15.5% reporting treatment of water to make it safer, 18.6% then said they used nothing to treat the water. Respondents reported using bleach (44.0%) and boiling (29.6%) primarily to treat drinking water. Most respondents (92.6%) reported washing her hands the day prior to the survey, speci cally after using latrine (70.2%), after cleaning feces (50.7%), before preparing food (42.5%). Most households do not use a latrine (65.1%). Of the 32.7% that do, the majority are unimproved latrines (73.0%), 16.4% are traditional improved latrines, cement slab, 2.7% non- ush latrines connected to a septic tank, and 0.3% ush latrines connected to septic tank. In 19.9% of the cases where there are latrines, these are shared with one or more families. The percentage of households using secure latrines ( ush latrine, non- ush latrine, traditional or common improved latrines as de ned by MICS) was reported to be 7.5% in Zamb\u0013 ezia (MICS, 2008), compared to 8.0% of all households in this survey. 36Table 26: Water and Sanitation Zamb\u0013 ezia-wide 95% CI Main source(s) of drinking water (n=930): Own faucet 4.6% (1.7, 7.6) Public faucet 17.3% (11.1, 23.5) Rain 1.8% (0.7, 2.9) River 21.9% (16.5, 27.3) HH container 0.5% (0.0, 1.1) Bottled 0.3% (0.0, 0.7) Well 58.8% (50.7, 67.0) Other 3.8% (1.6, 6.1) Do not know 0.5% (0.1, 1.0) Main source(s) of cooking water (n=930): Own faucet 3.4% (0.9, 5.9) Public faucet 13.6% (8.1, 19.1) Rain 1.5% (0.5, 2.6) River 24.3% (18.5, 30.1) HH container 2.6% (1.0, 4.1) Bottled 0.1% (0.0, 0.2) Well 58.8% (51.3, 66.3) Other 4.3% (2.0, 6.6) Do not know 0.3% (0.0, 0.7) Main source(s) of wash water (n=930): Own faucet 5.1% (2.3, 7.9) Public faucet 12.4% (7.1, 17.7) Rain 2.8% (1.7, 3.9) River 41.7% (33.7, 49.8) HH container 0.9% 1.5) 0.4) Well 47.3% (39.9, 54.7) Other 4.2% (1.8, 6.6) Do not know 0.2% (0.0, 0.4) Location of water sourceb(n=930) There is no water source 16.9% (12.8, 21.0) In the neighborhood 50.4% (43.2, 57.5) In the block 23.6% (17.7, 29.5) In the house 7.6% (4.2, 11.0) Do not know 0.5% (0.0, 1.0) No response 1.0% (0.3, 1.7) Household treats drinking waterb(n=930) No 83.0% (79.3, 86.7) Yes 15.5% (11.8, 19.1) Do not know 0.3% (0.0, 0.6) No response 1.2% (0.5, 1.9) Methods used to make water safer to drinkb(n=158) Bleach Nothing 18.6% (9.0, 28.2) Do not know 0.9% (0.0, 2.7) No response 0.4% (0.0, 1.2) Time to cooking water source (minutes)a(n=874) 7 (2, 30) Mode of transport to water sourceb(n=930) Bicycle 2.4% (1.1, 3.6) Bus 0.4% (0.0, 1.3) No response 5.7% (3.8, 7.6) On foot 91.5% (88.9, 94.0) Household has a water lterb(n=930) Do not (93.3, 96.8) Continued on Next Page. . . { Water and Sanitation, Continued Zamb\u0013 ezia-wide 95% CI No 1.0% (0.4, 1.7) No response 3.0% (1.4, 4.6) Yes 0.9% (0.1, 1.6) Washed hands yesterdayb(n=930) No 6.3% (4.0, 8.6) Yes 92.6% (90.2, 95.1) Do not know 0.1% (0.0, 0.3) No response 1.0% (0.4, 1.6) Situations for hand washing (n=871): After using latrine 70.2% (65.4, 75.0) After cleaning feces 50.7% (44.5, 56.9) Before food preparation 62.3% (56.2, 68.5) Before feeding children 48.8% (42.8, 54.9) Before eating 42.5% (36.8, 48.2) Other 1.1% (0.2, 2.1) Washed hands with soap, detergent, or ashesb(n=871) No 36.8% (31.1, 42.5) Yes 62.8% (57.0, 68.5) Do not know 0.2% (0.0, 0.4) No response 0.2% (0.0, 0.6) Household uses a latrineb(n=930) No 65.1% (57.9, 72.2) Yes 32.7% (25.7, 39.7) Do not know 0.3% (0.0, 0.7) No response 2.0% (1.1, 2.8) Among those households using a latrine (n=318): Latrine typeb(n=318) Unimproved (8.8, 24.0) Improved Latrine (with support structure) 5.0% (0.6, 9.3) Non- ush latrine connected to septic tank 2.7% (0.0, 5.6) Flush latrine connected to septic tank 0.3% (0.0, 1.0) Other 0.6% (0.0, 1.4) No response 2.0% (0.0, 4.2) Household shares latrineb(n=318) No 79.6% (73.8, 85.5) Yes 19.9% (13.9, 25.8) No response 0.5% (0.0, 1.2) Number of households sharing latrinea(n=63) 2 (2, 3) aContinuous variables are reported as weighted estimates of median (interquartile range), with each observation being weighted by the inverse of the household sampling probability. bCategorical variables are reported as weighted percentages, with each observation being weighted by the inverse of the household sampling probability.

Four types of indicators can be calculated to help understand the characteristics of and changes in household food insecurity (access) in the surveyed population. These indicators provide summary in- formation on household food insecurity and access, including conditions, domains, scale, and prevalence. Unfortunately there was an error in the skip logic on the mobile data collection device that rendered the scale unusable, and the only valid indicator of the list we were able to collect is any response regarding the availability of food in the past four weeks in the household. When asked if at any time during the past four weeks there had been no food of any kind because of lack of resources, 31.5% responded a\u000ermatively. Of those who responded a\u000ermatively, 18.2% reported that it occurs often, 44.4% said it occurs sometimes, and 33.7% said that it occurs rarely. See table 27. Household dietary diversity scores (HDDS) are calculated by summing the number of food groups consumed in the household over the 7 day recall period (FAO Nutrition and Consumer Protection Division, 2008). For the household dietary diversity score, 12 food groups are summed: 1. Maize or Cereals [survey items 1 and 2] 2. Roots and Tubers [3] 3. Vegetables [4 and 8] 4. Sugar or sugar products [5] 5. Beans [6] 6. Nuts [7] 7. Fruits [9] 8. Meat [10] 9. Poultry and Eggs [11] 10. Fish [12] 11. Oils and fats [13] 12. Milk and milk products [14] Household dietary diversity was high. The median (IQR) HDDS was 7 (5, 9); the range is 0 to 12.

The 95% con dence intervals include precision estimates that incorporate the e ects of strati cation and clustering. 5.2 Livelihood and agricultural practices Most households report receiving income through the sale of agricultural products (60.9%) or other local natural resources ( rewood, grass, charcoal, construction materials, etc.) (14.7%). Smaller proportions receive income through the sale of animals (8.7%) and wage labor (9.8%). Over one quarter of households reported receiving no income (29.2%), and nearly half reported receiving up to 1000 Mts per month (28 USD at the exchange rate of Sep 25, 2010), or roughly 1 USD per day. This means that roughly 75% of households in Zamb\u0013 ezia report having an income of 1 or less USD per day. See table 28. Most of the respondents reported farming (62.3%) and household work (23.5%) as their primary occupa- tion. Very small percentages of households reported any business or wage work as primary occupation. In most households (88.3%) there is a garden or small farm and household members sell crops from that farm (55.7%), although produce is not sold in 30.7% of the households. Among households with small farms, 39.4% report the soil is not good for food production. The farm productivity was reported to be limited by several conditions including soil quality, water, land area, time, and money. The most frequently cited conditions a ecting farm productivity was water and drought (28.4% and 11.9%, respectively). Regarding farming practices, 54.7% of households report regularly burning their elds, but very few use chemical products such as fertilizers (3.1%) and pesticides (1.5%). The vast majority of households do not irrigate their farms (95.8%), use conservation farming techniques (84.3%), nor receive any advice or training on conservation farming techniques (91.5%). About equal proportions of households have livestock versus no livestock. See table 29.

WHO provides macros for statistical software packages that calculate the indicators of the attained growth standards (length/height-for-age, weight-for-age, weight-for-length, weight-for-height, and body mass index-for-age). Seewww.who.int/childgrowth for more information. Moderate to severe low weight-for-age (underweight) is de ned by UNICEF as two standard deviations below the median weight-for-age of the WHO Child Growth Standards. The proportion of children aged 0- 60 month in the survey who were moderately or severely underweight was 13.8% (Table 31, Figure 2). The summary data for Sub-Saharan Africa for moderate to severe underweight from the State of the World's Children (SOWC) report was 23%; no SOWC 2010 data was available for moderate and severe underweight for Mozambique (UNICEF, 2010b). In our survey, the proportion of boys who were moderately or severely underweight was greater than the proportion of girls (15.2% versus 12.2%)(Tables 32 and 33). The proportion of children aged 0-60 months in the survey with moderate or severe stunting (de ned by UNICEF as two standard deviations below the median length/height-for-age of the WHO Child Growth Standards) was 36.4% (Table 31, Figure 3). The summary data for moderate and severe stunting from SOWC 2010 was 42% for Sub-Saharan Africa and 44% for Mozambique (UNICEF, 2010b). In our survey, the proportion of boys who were moderately or severely stunted was greater than the proportion of girls (37.7% versus 35.1%)(Tables 32 and 33). The proportion of children aged 0-60 months in the survey with moderate or severe wasting (de ned by UNICEF as two standard deviations below the median weight-for-length/height of the WHO Child Growth Standards [2006]) was 8.9% (Table 31, Figure 4). The summary data for moderate and severe wasting from SOWC 2010 was 10% for Sub-Saharan Africa and 4% for Mozambique (UNICEF, 2010b). The proportion of boys who were moderately or severely wasted was greater than the proportion of girls (9.5% versus 8.3%)(Tables 32 and 33). Table 30 summarizes child anthropometry from various previous surveys in Zamb\u0013 ezia; results are similar across surveys.

First, the random selection of enumeration areas resulted in a province-wide sample that did not include all districts; the districts of Pebane, Namarroi and Inhassunge were not included in the sample drawn. The enumeration areas were chosen with a selection probability proportional to population size, and it just so happens that no enumeration areas were selected for those three districts. Since the sample was not designed to provide estimates at a district level, but only at the provincial level, this was expected to happen. For the phase two sample, the districts chosen were Namacurra, Alto Mol\u0013 ocu\u0012 e and Morrumbala. These districts were chosen deliberately with partner input because many communities in those districts were recipients of Ogumaniha program activities, and because of their size also provided a good spread of the quantity of program activities. The consortium also felt that the three districts were located in settings representative of the coast, the Zamb\u0013 eze valley, and the highlands, providing enough variation in climate and geography. An unintended limitation is that the three chosen phase II districts were all ones where World Vision serves as the main coordinating partner for the district, and none are where ADRA serves as the district coordinator. Despite every e ort to adapt questions to the local context during the pilot phase of the study, certain questions were still di\u000ecult to obtain reliable, valuable information. Social desirability bias{or the interest in survey participants to provide the answers they believe surveyors wish to hear rather than the ones that re ect their actual knowledge, attitudes, beliefs and access to services{likely led to the over-reporting of satisfaction with services and underreporting of problems at health facilities. For example, survey teams reported that participants were reluctant to provide negative information about health service provision for fear of potential repercussions next time they attend a health facility. Also, teams reported that partic- ipants were reticent in providing information on the availability of income, fearing that it might negatively impact their access to external support. Interviewers reported that in many cases the women did not know the exact age of their children. Where possible, age of children under 5 years of age was determined using vaccination cards. In other cases, ages were estimated based on information provided by the women interviewed, such as \\The child was born at the time of the bean crop\". Estimations of child age will a ect the sensitivity of anthropometric measures, particularly for younger children. Additionally, rough eld conditions a ected the precisions of the instruments, although they were consistently calibrated prior to use. It is possible that orphans and vulnerable children (OVC) assistance was provided to households with- out any OVC, or that some households had OVC residing at one point but not at the time of the survey, which might account for the low proportion of households reporting receiving support for the orphans in their homes. It is also possible that the question could have been worded di erently to capture whether children who had lost at least one biological parent were living in the household, and whether families were receiving support for one or more children in the household, to better capture the information we sought. We did not explore the conceptualization of orphanhood in the Zamb\u0013 ezian context. Questions on sources of advice sought for a child displaying febrile, diarrheal, and respiratory symptoms showed a very high proportion seeking advice from hospitals and health centers. Upon investigation, survey teams reported that individuals in the community with ties to health facilities, such as activistas, APEs (basic polyvalent agents), and volunteers, were frequently reported as sources of information but were not a response option and therefore coded as either hospital or health facility. The information on sources of advice therefore overestimates the proportion seeking advice at health facilities. Response categories for certain questions related to households did not su\u000eciently capture response possibilities. For example, questions on water source listed \\well\", but not whether the well was open or 52capped; sources of light included ashlights but not oil and kerosene lamps. These limitations reduce the quality of information available on households. The modi ed version of the Household Food Insecurity and Access Score (HFIAS) had an error in the skip logic on the mobile data collection device that rendered the scale unusable; the only valid indicator of the list we were able to analyze and report uponw was the availability of food in the past four weeks in the household. 8 Next Steps Several steps will be taken following the completion of the baseline survey. First, results from Phase I will be shared with all Ogumaniha consortium members and their partners in a forum event to be held in Quelimane in late October 2010. The purpose of the forum will be to disseminate ndings, determine how project activities may need to be realigned or reconceptualized based on the ndings, and to identify areas for further in-depth examination in order to ne tune project activities to meet the needs identi ed. Sum- mary information from Phase I should also be disseminated through Ogumaniha District Coordinators to District Administrators and local leaders, to help with local planning. Health-related data will be shared with the Provincial Health Directorate as requested in order to help with prioritization of government activities. One assessment focusing on follow-up of one or more issues discovered through the survey and other M&E activities will be designed and conducted in Year 2 of Ogumaniha implementation, based on the discussions from the partner forum. Phase II ndings will next be analyzed and disseminated, to provide concrete information on the three focus districts for the Ogumaniha project. The Phase II ndings will provide further guidance on pro- grammatic areas needing particular attention during project implementation. Both Phase I and Phase II data will be used together to review project targets de ned in the Ogumaniha Project Monitoring Plan, revising them should the need arise. Lessons learned from the data collection period will be gathered during a full-day meeting with all survey teams. The lessons will be summarized in a separate document and will guide the implementation of the nal, medium-term impact evaluation to be conducted at the end of Ogumaniha's project period. Improvements may be made to the survey instrument to ensure that it captures information of interest, keeping in mind that substantial revisions will limit the comparability of data between the baseline data collection and the end-of-project evaluation. Separate secondary analyses will be conducted on both Phase I and Phase II data. One of the analyses will assess the poverty levels of the community based on the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI) multidimensional de nition of poverty. Additional analyses will emerge from the forum discussions as well as from a meeting of all those involved in the development of the survey instrument during a 2-day meeting to be held at Vanderbilt University in mid-November. 53References Aliago, A. and Ruilin, R.
