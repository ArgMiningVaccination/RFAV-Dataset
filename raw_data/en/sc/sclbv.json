Blumberg Institute , which we established to fulfill our research mission, are both in very strong positions as we look to the future. next year HBF will celebrate its 25th Anniversary, so it is only fitting that our new strategic plan includes the ambitious goal that no one will die from hepatitis B by 2030 . Although audacious, it is in alignment with the World Health organization's global hepatitis plan that calls for the elimination of hepatitis B and C by 2030. this will require national and international action, which the HBF is already helping to lead. the HBF's international programs have become models of hepatitis B outreach. In Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam we are partners in a project to reach 10,000 at-risk individuals with screening and linkage to care efforts. this effort builds on our ongoing Haimen City, China program, which has now reached more than 1 million individuals and brought almost 2,000 patients into care. In the u.S., we continue to lead national advocacy efforts with Capitol Hill visits; ensure that hepatitis B and liver cancer are included in appropriation language; and host Congressional briefings on hepatitis B issues. At the Blumberg Institute, our drug discovery program is working at full speed, powered by the successful $3 million Nobel Challenge campaign that enabled us to recruit 5 renowned scientists in the field! But it is our research collaboration with Arbutus Biopharma that will truly make a difference in rapidly advancing our discoveries from the lab to the clinic. Within the next year, it is entirely conceivable that the drugs we discovered, or helped to discover, will start being tested in people. that speed of progress is almost unprecedented in drug discovery. the HBF and the Blumberg Institute are very strong. But we can't be complacent. our new strategic plan will lead us to transformational discoveries and provide a strong basis for our continued ability to provide vision and leadership in making hepatitis B history. Joel Rosen, esq. timothy M. Block, phD Chairman of the Board President and Co-Founder Dear Friends,Our Impact Our Vision Cause for a Cure The Hepatitis B Foundation is a national nonprofit organization dedicated to finding a cure and improving the quality of life for those affected by hepatitis B worldwide through research, education and patient advocacy.Hepat itis B Foundation 2015 Annual Report3 cccDNA Inhibitors Fast Tracked We are among the first, if not the only, to identify a small molecule inhibitor of HBV cccDnA formation, which is very significant since inhibition of cccDnA is considered essential in achieving a complete cure. the drug has now been made highly active and is licensed for further development to Arbutus Biopharma, the first company solely dedicated to HBV drug discovery (read more on page 4). Designer Drugs Drs. John Kulp and Yanming Du are using computer modeling to design and produce targeted HBV and liver cancer drugs that include new HBV capsid inhibitors and \"YeS kinase\" inhibitors.Harnessing the Immune System Drs. Ju-Tao Guo and Jinhong Chang have developed a new HBV drug that works by activating an infected liver cell's own immune defenses, which has shown to be effective in animal studies. HBV Drugs, Naturally Drs. Tianlun Zhou and John Kulp have screened thousands of plant and fungal extracts from our extensive natural products Collection, donated to us by Merck & Co. in 2011, to mine for drugs derived from \"natural products\" that inhibit HBV cccDnA and viral proteins. the exciting news is that their work has resulted in two new leads that show activity against HBV.the Blumberg Institute recruited 5 renowned scientists to work full time on hepatitis B research as a result of the HBF's successful $3 million fundraising campaign. Standing L to R: Drs. Tianlun Zhou, Jinhong Chang, Ying-Hsiu Su, Timothy Block, and Ju-Tao Guo. (March 2015) Novel HBV Therapeutic Targets the Blumberg Institute and its world-class researchers are significantly driving the scientific momentum towards innovative ways to combat the hepatitis B virus (HBV). t oday, we are committing everything we have, every resource at our disposal, in pursuit of a cure to benefit the more than 240 million people living with hepatitis B worldwide.this year the HBF met A Nobel Challenge and raised $3 million to help the Blumberg Institute recruit top scientific talent to accelerate the pace of research. our goal, however, is not merely to support the development of new hepatitis B treatments or to raise awareness about this serious liver disease. our mission is to eliminate hepatitis B, to relegate it to the history books. the extraordinarily successful Nobel Challenge campaign is powering our efforts to do precisely that. OUR BREAKTHROUGHS Courtesy of John Kulp, BSBI Driving Research the Baruch S. Blumberg Institute , established by the Hepatitis B Foundation to fulfill its research mission, is closing in on its search to find a cure for hepatitis B. With nearly 50 scientists, the Blumberg Institute may now be the largest group of nonprofit researchers working on hepatitis B in the world. 4 Hepat itis B Foundation 2014 Annual Report 4 A \"Doylestown Algorithm\" risk calculator for cirrhosis and liver cancer (Dr. Anand Mehta et al)Detecting Liver Cancer Early A blinded study using DnA markers developed by Dr. Ying-Hsiu Su in collaboration with researchers at thomas Jefferson university were found to detect liver cancer more effectively than currently approved methods. the study results showed that Dr. Su's markers were superior to alpha-feto protein (AFp) in detecting liver cancer in people. Indeed, her urine-based assay detected at least 90% of primary liver cancer at early stages. A Better Formula for Predicting Cancer the Doylestown Algorithm, developed by Blumberg Institute and Drexel university scientists, is ready to take center stage! no new tests are required for this formula to be used, just the tests a doctor already orders. In a study with more than 2,000 people, the Doylestown Algorithm was found to be a better predictor of liver cancer than current blood test markers alone.RESEARCH BREAKTHROUGHS at the Blumberg Institute, continued New Blumberg Institute Partnership with Arbutus Biopharma In 2015, the Blumberg Institute entered into a three-year research agreement with Arbutus Biopharma, a company focused solely on HBV drug development. this unique partnership will allow us to move our discoveries more rapidly from proof-of-principle stage \u2014 through translational research \u2014 into human clinical trials. our scientists will work collaboratively with Arbutus on novel approaches to HBV and liver cancer, based on an overarching research plan with the shared goal of developing a cure for hepatitis B, which causes up to 1 million deaths each year worldwide. (April 2015) internationally renowned scientists and their research staff recruited to the Blumberg Institute to work full time on HBV.44+ articles published in prestigious scholarly journals. $6 million in research revenue from federal and state grants, tech transfer, and charitable gifts.5 Nearly 50 HBV researchers work at the Blumberg Institute.In 2015...Hepat itis B Foundation 2015 Annual Report5 International HBV Meeting Goes Viral the International HBV Meeting, coordinated by the Hepatitis B Foundation and the annual definitive meeting on the molecular biology of hepatitis B and D, is truly going viral as interest in HBV as a curable disease gains momentum. the 2015 HBV Meeting was held in october with more than 400 scientists from around the world traveling to Bad nauheim, Germany. Co-chairs Drs. Haitao Guo (Indiana u, uSA) and Dieter Glebe (Giessen u, Germany) kicked off the meeting with a clinical symposium that brought HBV molecular biologists together with physicians and drug development professionals to stimulate collaborations and accelerate the pace of drug discovery research for hepatitis B. 2015 Bruce Witte Lecturer: Dr. Hashem El-Serag each year HBF invites an outstanding leader in the field to give the Bruce Witte Distinguished Lecture and Hashem El-Serag, MD, MPH (right) was invited to present his important research on hepatitis B and liver cancer. this named lectureship is generously sponsored by HBF co-founders Paul and Janine Witte. (March 19, 2015) 3 Student Winners at the 2015 Siemens Competition the HBF Summer Research Internship Program is advancing the national SteM priorities by providing college and high school students with valuable \"hands-on\" experience in the Blumberg Institute labs under the supervision of professional scientists. Since the year 2000, we have graduated 126 alumni who have gone on to college, graduate or medical school, and employment in biotech or pharmaceutical companies. this summer 3 of our high school interns in Dr. Ying-Hsiu Su's lab won team honors for their research project at the Siemens Competition.

Our Liver Cancer Recommendations Published by Journal of the National Cancer Institute A group of 20 of the nation's leading liver cancer experts were convened for the HBF's bi-annual Princeton Workshop in March 2015 to focus on improving screening and care for those with HBV-related liver cancer. over two days, the group discussed the gaps and limitations in current approaches for the detection and treatment of primary liver cancer, and defined research priorities and opportunities for advocacy. A summary of the liver cancer recommendations has been published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, which is available online and will appear in the April 2016 print issue.6 Hepat itis B Foundation 2014 Annual Report 6 Impacting Public Health elimination of hepatitis B is the ultimate goal of the Hepatitis B Foundation and the focus of our public health programs. t o achieve this goal, we have developed successful community-based programs to increase vaccination, screening and linkage to care to stop the spread of this deadly virus. to harness the community energy and maintain the momentum, we are building coalitions at the local, national and international levels to improve capacity to ensure that every person knows their hepatitis B status and has access to the care they need to prevent a new infection or treat a chronic infection. the Hep B United 3rd national Summit in Washington, DC also included visits to members of Congress on World Hepatitis Day. Advocates stand with Congressman Mike Honda from California (center) who is our key HBV champion! (July 28, 2015)HBF , in partnership with AApCHo (Association of Asian pacific Community Health organizations), created and leads Hep B United, a national coalition of 24 member coalitions across the country that are working to address hepatitis B in their local communities. Hep B United members are finding success in bringing together key stakeholders such as community-based organizations, healthcare providers, hospitals and clinics, state and local health departments, student groups, and elected officials and community leaders to increase HBV awareness, screening, vaccination and linkage to care in high-risk communities. Hep B United is also proud to be an official partner of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and is co-branded with its Know Hepatitis B campaign, their first national multi-lingual awareness campaign on hepatitis B. OUR LOCAL IMPACT In 2008 the HBF created a program to address hepatitis B in its own backyard - philadelphia! over the past 7 years this program has grown into a thriving hepatitis B coalition of 75 members that work together in high-risk communities to educate, screen and link individuals to care. It has also become a model to test promising best practices to improve efficiency and health outcomes around hepatitis B nationwide. In 2012, the coalition was renamed Hep B United Philadelphia. OUR NATIONAL IMPACT Led by HBF leaders and the Hep B United Philadelphia coalition, more than 60 advocates stormed City Hall to demand an end to the silence around viral hepatitis. (May 2015)Hepat itis B Foundation 2015 Annual Report7 24 member coalitions in 24 cities across 14 statesHep B United Across America Hepatitis B Foundation in Haimen City, ChinaOUR INTerNATIONAL IMPACT Since 2011 the HBF has conducted an ambitious public health HBV program in Haimen City, China to reach all 1 million residents. the citywide campaign included educating physicians, government officials, community leaders, the general public, and testing all pregnant women over a 12-month period. today we are focused on strategies to empower patients to take control of their own care and to partner with their providers to improve their long-term health. As we look to the future, we plan to build on our success and use Haimen City as a model for other high-prevalence countries, which currently includes supporting a program in Vietnam and sharing our experiences with leaders in Mongolia .4 million Asian Americans reached 13,000 educational sessions provided40,000 people screened 47 volunteers participate in the National Speakers Bureau with 9 languages represented 1,441 (90%) healthcare providers trained 5,407 (100%) pregnant women screened over one-year period 12,000 people screened for hepatitis B 1,382 enrolled in patient empowerment program 1 million (100%) residents educated \"I am so grateful for the advice given. You have given me so much hope and reason to live again.\" \"You have restored a lot of strength and hope in me.\" 8 Hepat itis B Foundation 2014 Annual Report 8 Living Outreach the Hepatitis B Foundation is a beacon of hope for the more than 240 million people worldwide who live with hepatitis B. We provide valuable information and support through our Help l ines via phone, email and social media. o ur counselors answer questions about test results, transmission, vaccination, and treatment. We link people to care by referring them to healthcare providers, clinical trials and other resources in the u .S. and abroad. Connections for the Liver Cancer Journey our web-based LiverCancerConnect.org program provides people diagnosed with primary liver cancer accurate information and timely referrals to expert medical care. With liver cancer rates exploding - it is now the 2 nd most common cause of death from cancer worldwide, with HBV being the primary cause of liver cancer - there is a tremendous need for patient-focused information. In the united States, liver cancer is one of the only cancers that is increasing in incidence while most cancer rates are decreasing. Behind all of these staggering facts, however, are patients and families struggling with liver cancer, which is why we created LiverCancerConnect.org. our goal is to connect people with the information, support and resources they need to bring hope to their liver cancer journey.1.2 million visitors from 200 countries visited www.hepb.org 4,000 people directly contacted us via phone, email, and social media Nearly 5,000 Facebook followers10 languages included on our website with translated information about hepatitis B for our non-English speaking visitorsScoring 60 this impressive Klout Score reflects our strong social media influence_ Find HBF on your favorite social media networks and join the global conversation! /hepbfoundation @hepbfoundation /hepbfoundation wp.hepb.orgHepat itis B Foundation 2015 Annual Report9 Leading Advocacy Hepatitis B is the most common, serious liver disease in the world and it thrives on silence. t o bring hepatitis B out of the shadows, the Hepatitis B Foundation is leading the effort to turn up the volume to prioritize hepatitis B as an urgent health priority. As the foremost research and disease advocacy organization for hepatitis B, we are speaking out on the national and international stage to demand increased attention and funding to eliminate hepatitis B once and for all. 1st World Hepatitis Summit Held in Scotland the World Health organization (WHo), in joint partnership with the Scottish Government and the World Hepatitis Alliance, co-organized the 1 st World Hepatitis Summit in Glasgow, Scotland on September 2-4, 2015. More than 80 countries were represented with 600 leaders from government, public health agencies, and non-governmental organizations participating. The HBF presented about its successes and challenges in the u.S. during a pre-summit conference. the message was serious. Hepatitis B and C kill more people each year than HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis combined, and represent the 7 th leading cause of death worldwide, yet viral hepatitis as a global health concern remains mostly invisible and under-funded. Without significant intervention, WHo estimates there will be 20 million needless deaths over the next 15 years around the world. WHo leaders unveiled their draft global viral hepatitis plan, the first of its kind. Its twin goals of reducing chronic viral hepatitis cases by 90 percent and deaths by 65 percent by 2030 are ambitious, but possible. CAPITOL HIGHLIGHTS HBF helped organize the first joint Hepatitis on the Hill visits to members of Congress in March that brought more than 100 hepatitis advocates to Washington, DC. patients and family members shared their stories to put a human face on the devastating impact of viral hepatitis and to call for increased federal funding to address the viral hepatitis epidemic. on July 28, designated World Hepatitis Day by the World Health organization in honor of Dr. Baruch Blumberg's birthday, a commemorative White House Briefing honored national leaders, including Joan Block, HBF executive director and co- founder, for advancing the goals of the u.S. national Viral Hepatitis Action plan. the national Academy of Medicine (formerly the Institute of Medicine or IoM) invited Dr. Robert Gish, HBF medical director, and Dr. Chari Cohen, HBF director of Public Health, to share expert testimony as the Academy prepares its report on the elimination of viral hepatitis in the united States, slated for release in 2016. 10 Hepat itis B Foundation 2014 Annual Report 10 PAtRoNS ($500 to $999) Anonymous AASLD Apple, Inc.
