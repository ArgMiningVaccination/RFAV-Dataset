What's on this page: You may have been prescribed medication to control a health condition, lower your blood pressure, help your heart work better, or to prevent a heart attack or stroke. But all medications come with possible side effects. If medication side effects are bothering you, or putting you off taking medicines that could improve your quality of life, you're not alone. But it's worth remembering that your doctor has prescribed them to keep you healthy and because the benefits outweigh the risks, so don't just stop taking them: read on to find out why this happens and what to do.

There are several reasons why medicines can cause side effects. Sometimes, the intended effect of the drug can cause issues. For example, [blood thinners](/informationsupport/publications/heart-conditions/medical-information-sheets/anticoagulants) are designed to reduce your risk of a [heart attack](/informationsupport/conditions/heart-attack) or [stroke](/informationsupport/conditions/stroke), by making blood less likely to clot and cause a heart attack or stroke. But that can also mean that it takes longer to stop bleeding if you cut yourself, and you may bruise more. Many medicines work by targeting the chemicals your body uses to control its processes. Sometimes, the same chemical may control more than one process, or a medicine may affect more than one chemical. For example, [beta blockers](/informationsupport/heart-matters-magazine/medical/drug-cabinet/beta-blockers) block the release of the stress hormones adrenaline and noradrenaline in parts of your body. This slows the heart rate down and can also lower blood pressure. This means they can be a useful way to lower blood pressure, but if your blood pressure is already normal and you're taking it to control your heart rate or angina, the blood-pressure-lowering effect may lead to dizziness. It may also be that a particular ingredient doesn't suit you, or your medication could be interacting with other medication or supplements you take. There is also lot of research to show that if we expect to get a side effect, we will. This is called the \"nocebo effect\". Several research studies have found that most side effects from statins are caused by the nocebo effect - people get almost the same rates of side effects when they are taking a dummy pill. Can I get help with paying my prescription? Medical prescriptions are free in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. They are also free for people in England who meet certain criteria, including people who are: - under 16 or over 60 - receiving Income Support, JSA, ESA or Universal Credit - pregnant - 16-18 and in full-time education - and/or have certain health conditions, including a continuing disability or diabetes that can't be controlled with diet. If you aren't entitled to free prescriptions for your medicines you might be able to save money by buying a Prescription Prepayment Certificate (PPC).

It's normal to be worried about getting a side effect when you're already dealing with a health problem. But try not to think about it too much. The nocebo effect is heavily influenced by your expectations - the more you expect to get a side effect, the more likely it is that you will. It can be useful to remember that most of the main heart medications are taken by millions of people every day, and many of them experience no side effects at all. We're all different, so even if a friend or family member has had a side effect from a particular medication, that doesn't mean that you will. All medicines have possible side effects, but you may not experience any of them Antania Tang, Senior Advice and Support Pharmacist at the National Pharmacy Association says: \"All medicines have possible side effects, but you may not experience any of them. Remember you want to treat the problem that you went to see the GP about. If you don't start your medication, you won't be treating that problem.\" What to do if you have side effects from medication Many people find that side effects only last a few days after starting a new medication. If you continue to have problems, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or specialist before you decide to stop taking it. Some side effects, such as problems with sex, might feel difficult or embarrassing to talk about at first, but they will have heard similar questions before, and can help you find a solution. They may be able to suggest changes, such as a lower dose, or splitting the dose across the day. If that doesn't work, you may be able to try an alternative medicine. Or your doctor may be able to give you something that can help with side effects such as nausea. Another possibility is changing the way you take your medication. Antania explains: \"Your doctor may suggest that it's best to take your medication with or after food if it's causing stomach irritation. Or if it's a water tablet (diuretic) and you're being disturbed by having to get up a lot at night, they may say take it in the morning, not in the evening.\" Getting it right can mean a bit of trial and error, but it can be worth persisting Getting it right can mean a bit of trial and error, but it can be worth persisting so you can manage your medication and feel as well as you can. Keeping a diary of any side effects can help your doctor or pharmacist understand how you've been feeling. This will help you to work with them to find a solution that suits you, so you can continue to take your medication and stay as well as possible. Tell your GP or pharmacist as soon as you can if your medicines are causing dizziness (which might increase the risk of you having a fall), severe nose bleeds, or other side effects that are worrying you. Don't just stop taking the medication: wait until you have spoken to a health professional, as stopping may cause other problems with your health. How a pharmacist can help Pharmacists are experts in medication and can be a good source of information and support. You don't need an appointment. You can visit or call any pharmacist - it doesn't have to be your nearest one, which can be handy if you are away from home and need advice. Antania Tang says: \"They can help you explore the problem and determine if you need to speak to your GP. You can call a pharmacist if that is easier than going in. Pharmacies are open longer hours than GP practices and are often open over the weekend. \"If you live in England and you've started a new medication, your pharmacist can provide support and advice over the first few weeks through the [New Medicine Service](https://www.nhs.uk/nhs-services/prescriptions-and-pharmacies/pharmacies/new-medicine-service-nms/). It's free and can help with medication for conditions including high blood pressure, heart failure and diabetes.\" Ask your pharmacist about it when you take your prescription to the pharmacy. In Scotland, there is a [Medicines, Care and Review Service](https://www.nhsinform.scot/care-support-and-rights/nhs-services/pharmacy/medicines-care-and-review-service) to give help to people with long-term conditions. You need to be registered with a GP in Scotland, and you need to be registered with a community pharmacy (this is free, quick and easy to do - tell your pharmacist you want to register.) There are slightly different schemes in Wales and Northern Ireland - but if you need help with your medication or side effects, it's worth asking your local pharmacy. \"I found a way through my side effects\" - Soma's story Soma Biwas, 55, from London, has been on medication for type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol for 11 years, but five years ago she started experiencing unpleasant side effects. \"I began to have problems with a weak bladder. My doctor suspected it may be the diabetic medication, but I couldn't stop taking it, as it is controlling the diabetes so well. Having a bladder problem was really affecting my life and I began to feel ashamed and depressed. It took a while for my doctor to understand what a big issue this was for me \"It did take a while for my doctor to understand what a big issue this was for me. I was given some pelvic floor exercises to do, but they didn't help. Then I got referred to a specialist, although even then I had several appointments that were cancelled. So it took a long time, but I was started on a new medication to help with the problem and it has made a big difference. I can now focus on what's important to me, such as looking after my son and training for a pilgrimage through north and east India. \"What I'd say to other people is, don't just stop taking your medication. Ask your doctor for help. Keep asking if you need to - it's important to find a solution to your medications that protects your health and still allows you to live your life.\" Published September 2022 What to read next... "}
