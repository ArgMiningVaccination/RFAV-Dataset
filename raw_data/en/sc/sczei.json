Chinese medicine integrates the use of acupuncture, Chinese herbal medicine, cupping and moxibustion in addition to dietary & lifestyle recommendations specific to the individual's constitution and particular health concerns. Treating both the root cause of illness, and the symptoms that arise due to energetic imbalances, results in healing that reaches a deep level and tends to be lasting.

What to expect during your first visit Your first office visit with will be an hour and a half long. We will have time to discuss your particular health concerns as well as your health history, diet and lifestyle, exercise, emotional tendencies, and current stress levels. It is very helpful if you bring a list of all supplements and medications that you are currently taking (with brands and dosages) as well as the approximate length of time you have been taking them. As a diagnostic tool we will feel the pulse on both wrists and examine your tongue. We will use this information to assess any patterns of disharmony that exists and devise a treatment plan specifically for you. You will then receive an acupuncture treatment that will last about 25-40 minutes; we will insert the needles and leave you to rest. Most people report feeling deeply relaxed after a session and many fall asleep during treatment. A recommendation will be made for when to schedule a follow-up visit. When treating acute pain or deep-seated conditions, a series of treatments may be necessary to make lasting changes. In certain cases, bi-weekly treatments (for 2-3 weeks) may bring one fastest relief. Your treatment plan may also include dietary and lifestyle recommendations and possibly a Chinese herbal formula prescription. "}
