Palpation is the process of using practitioner's hands to examine the body, especially while perceiving/diagnosing a disease or illness. it is the process of feeling an object in or on the body to determine its size, shape, firmness, texture, location, and tenderness of an organ or body part. Palpation is an important part of the physical examination; the sense of touch is just as important in this examination as the sense of sight is. "}
