Some years ago, my parents were visiting and there was to be a sunset orchestral concert near a waterhole, that supplied elephants and other animals. As people gathered for the concert, a herd of elephants was finishing up and starting to file away, the matriarch first, then the mothers with babies and the young males last. As they were leaving, the orchestra began to play. My mom said that theelephants all stopped, stood for a minute and then the matriarch turned and led her group back to the side of the waterhole.

And thank you! to faculty who contributed to the important Humanics Workshop this week. Seasons Change - 4.21.23 Archer, our very senior dog can manage only a short evening walk now, but we always pass a tree that I've been rooting for, so to speak, almost all its life. It was planted around a decade ago and confronted by 80 inches of snow that first winter. The snow bent the trunk almost vertically downward, and I thought it would snap. But in spring, to my amazement, the trunk more or less straightened, and the tree made a few leaves. Spring Clean Up - 4.14.23 It's been around twenty years since we did home renovations. The basement bathroom is disintegrating, the original 1938 kitchen cabinets drip sawdust, floor tiles treacherously protrude, the roof leaks and yesterday, the front steps collapsed. So, we have embarked on a home improvement strategic plan, with exciting findings. For example, demolition of the basement bathroom revealed that one wall was only a sheet of now-rotten wood, that when removed revealed a creepy underground passage extending deep into the earth. Of course, fixing this required unanticipated investment in a sturdy cinder block wall and some loads of earth. Renovations come with their close partner - Clean Up. Traditions - 4.7.23 Passover is the tradition I know best this time of year, that involves some unique foods. The dish called haroset represents the mortar that enslaved Israelites in Egypt used for building. Haroset often includes finely chopped nuts and apples, but the rest is open for play. My mom made hers with walnuts, raisins, apples and wine but it was a little bitter and watery, so I evolved a version with pecans, dates, raisins, apples and honey which is totally delicious and has become a new family tradition. Help, Spring - 3.31.23 And this week, the sleepiness of Winter in the natural world rapidly dissipated. On Krentzman Quad the allium bulbs have sprouted, and rabbits are enjoying the bright shoots. A neighbor's garden is a carpet of snowdrops and little blue star flowers whose name I don't know. And my favorite chipmunks, having been cuddled up in their burrows, are venturing out. There is a lot of scurrying in Spring, and how wonderful are the longer days. Women in Science - 3.24.23 Let me ask you: how has it been to be a woman in science? And this question is for anyone who identifies as a woman in the College of Science, faculty or staff. It's a big sample size. So how is it going? How has it been? Do you have a story or two to demonstrate? I have a basketful of anecdotes on the topic. We have a Plan! - 3.17.23 Way back, on October 21, 2022, I shared with you that we were launching a Strategic Planning process. I shared that our plan would address important contributions of the College of Science to the future of academic science and the future of Northeastern University, supporting the Northeastern academic plan. And I shared that it would be a plan from us all, with the opportunity for input from every College member. Hands-In - 3.3.23 Every day, we give our College of Science students opportunities way beyond a two-foot square plot, but the idea is the same. Learn by routing about, hands-in, growing to understand where you want to put your talent and time. Thank you and congratulations! to every staff member, every faculty member for contributing to our important, wonderful experiential landscape. The Winter Bear - 2.24.23 One of my favorite books (geared to all of us young readers) is [The Winter Bear](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnortheastern.us12.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3Db4e7744d07bed3a062e958b16%26id%3Ded0ec30199%26e%3D0b15ffdc63&data=05%7C01%7Cn.villacorta%40northeastern.edu%7Cc6a7179c7266488c8df908db16ade595%7Ca8eec281aaa34daeac9b9a398b9215e7%7C0%7C0%7C638128708372558113%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=si7Dd7bUWuMn5WZS%2FN3SFApCAqFQ3fUZPgQUgKO1uVk%3D&reserved=0). It has lovely illustrations, perfect for this time of year, where the skeletons of trees stand out, there are bits of snow, and a pale sun. It's also a perfect story because the arc is so clear: three children go for a walk, find a stuffed bear stuck in a tree, run home amidst a sudden snowstorm, and install the bear in a cozy armchair. Any story with a clear arc is satisfying, even comforting, where the beginning, middle and end are seamlessly linked.

A Black man, Tyre Nichols died after a brutal beating by police following a routine traffic stop. The episode makes me weep. We must affirm that in the College of Science and at Northeastern University, we embrace a culture of respect, where each person is valued for their contribution and is treated equitably, and where each person belongs. We oppose racism. We do not tolerate any form of discrimination. We strive to have diverse membership and commit to promoting equity and anti-racist policies through education and action. Spring Semester - 1.27.2023 This week has brought devastating news of shootings in California, and the horror of Tyre Banks killing is beginning to unfold, among other troubling events.

Someone who can turn unclear into understanding, who can answer questions, who can give fair support. And don't be shy to ask for help, in my experience, the answer is almost always positive. Sometimes the request for help is distant, but real. Our Food Drive and your outstanding response was helpful in such a way. Thank you for contributing!

Particularly fun is the full earth globe you can rotate, to look at places that are nowhere near your destination, but exotic possibilities. All this comes from satellite images, and [Google Earth](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnortheastern.us12.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3Db4e7744d07bed3a062e958b16%26id%3D1eefdd7bc0%26e%3D6b16a658db&data=05%7C01%7Cja.donnelly%40northeastern.edu%7C254fb2473cd04ac4c19608dada2d292e%7Ca8eec281aaa34daeac9b9a398b9215e7%7C0%7C0%7C638062184775530392%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=es64Q5vC4Lx812IcMhidq8sKwQ2xNMmrYW8bVwkD5%2Fs%3D&reserved=0) is a fantastic use of these data, despite some privacy concerns. That you can find your house, check out another location, or get (mostly correct) directions is terrific.

My house shows up with a swing set from long ago in the garden. Google Earth is a great example of where science, engineering and computation can meet, with stunning application. Indeed, satellites are one of the few realizations of space technology that exceed predictions of science fiction, which by now would have projected we could all readily zip around the universe. Collaboration - 12.2.22 My first collaboration was during an undergraduate research project, titled 'An Investigation into the Effect of Crowding on Growth of Xenopus laevis Tadpoles', a creative melding between the fields of ecology and developmental biology. Turns out that crowded tadpoles grow less rapidly than those spread out, and my project was to figure out why. I thought that the crowded populations might eat less than uncrowded and measured this using a radioactive tracer. Later, I harvested each tadpole and counted the number of radioactive emissions. There were hundreds of tadpoles, so I got lots of data, and had no idea what to do with it. My advisor told me to do statistics, but I had no idea what that meant. You need a collaborator! he said and sent me to his colleague in the Math department. It was a bit daunting, but the senior Professor listened respectfully and kindly as I explained the point of the project, what data I'd collected, and how I had been advised to do statistics. He recommended using the [Students T-Test](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnortheastern.us12.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3Db4e7744d07bed3a062e958b16%26id%3Daa3b7d53ba%26e%3D6b16a658db&data=05%7C01%7Cja.donnelly%40northeastern.edu%7Cb329704334a1413ae9ad08dad4a1f006%7Ca8eec281aaa34daeac9b9a398b9215e7%7C0%7C0%7C638056089251323485%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=EzcjgGbd%2BE2QBEOtv0bUrvYJoVqryoI27%2BBojtpayOY%3D&reserved=0), writing on a piece of lined paper the steps to figure out whether crowded and uncrowded tadpoles ate significantly different amounts. (They did not, so a re-think was needed there). I was so grateful for the guidance, and that collaboration was an empowering life event. Get One's Teeth Into - 11.18.22 My second-grade friend Beverly and I were playing an innovative follow-the-leader game around the house, one with eyes open leading the other with eyes closed. Walking side by side, Beverly leading me, I suddenly collided hard with something, jolting my head and front teeth. Turned out, Beverly had walked through a door, and I had walked into the wall beside it. My mom drove me to Dr. Hotz the dentist, who said luckily the teeth were not shattered, although one front tooth was missing a chunk and there was a crack across the one next door. The chunk is still missing, the memory indelible. Honor - 11.4.22 Walking by Curry last week, I was thrilled to see Cooper and his handler NUPD Officer Rachel Joliffe coming towards me. As you likely know, Cooper is a magnificent golden retriever who nonchalantly accepts the love of hundreds of Northeastern students, faculty and staff every day. There's something about a sweet dog that gets deep into the soul and comforts. As we approach Veterans Day this year, which has the theme of Honor, we acknowledge the terrible aftermath of combat on our troops.

Underworld of Traffic - 10.28.22 Driving along route nine this week was a descent into the underworld - blazing red lights amidst dense foggy rain, the pace glacial. Van Halen on WZLX could not make a dent. But along that road there's a spot where a movie from my mind pops up, that conjured away the fog. It's a balmy summer afternoon, after my daughter's impressive trapeze performance at circus camp, and we're driving home, suddenly very hungry. Rosie's Bakery is conveniently right there, and we opt for a large box of apricot [rugelach](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https://northeastern.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u%3Db4e7744d07bed3a062e958b16%26id%3D097508050b%26e%3D6b16a658db&data=05%7c01%7cja.donnelly%40northeastern.edu%7c3f79efd1f91f4422156e08dab924d6d4%7ca8eec281aaa34daeac9b9a398b9215e7%7c0%7c0%7c638025865139402828%7cUnknown%7cTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7c3000%7c%7c%7c&sdata=woowQBod70YjNNInAAwZ2Ot6Hqe4C96V6B9M44/4Zxs%3D&reserved=0), right out of the oven. Back in the car, we eat almost all of them, a beyond perfect bite, that can still brighten a gloomy rush hour. Planning Strategically - 10.21.22 At its best, goal setting can be a mind-stretching, useful exercise - an opportunity to reflect, synthesize and think deeply about next steps. When the mind is free and playful, creative ways to do business, new ideas and important insights can result. As you know, I've set goals for the College of Science that are specific enough to give us direction, and general enough to allow evolution: - Commit to a Culture of Respect and Action towards Equity - Communicate the Good Power of Science - Solve the Greatest Research Challenges - Promote Innovative and Global Education - Reinvent the PhD - Increase Undergraduate Research - Build an Entrepreneurship Landscape - Define Space and Work for the Future We've made excellent progress in most categories and are poised to address others. Animal Experimentation - 10.14.22 This week you might have read how human neurons, the cells that receive and send signals around the nervous system had been [implanted into a rat brain](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https://northeastern.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u%3Db4e7744d07bed3a062e958b16%26id%3Ddae7d0caf0%26e%3D6b16a658db&data=05%7c01%7cja.donnelly%40northeastern.edu%7c501ad116ac5a4fe346cd08daae27c307%7ca8eec281aaa34daeac9b9a398b9215e7%7c0%7c0%7c638013783063215311%7cUnknown%7cTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7c3000%7c%7c%7c&sdata=72cx2rkthN12Dre2Nq0xjN8CrRIgIX7AkGcFcVEoNTg%3D&reserved=0). The human neurons thrived and integrated into the rat brain so that when they were stimulated, the rat's behavior changed. This is another step in the surprising understanding that cells can 'self-organize' to form small bits of human organs, called ' [organoids'](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https://northeastern.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u%3Db4e7744d07bed3a062e958b16%26id%3D932c247908%26e%3D6b16a658db&data=05%7c01%7cja.donnelly%40northeastern.edu%7c501ad116ac5a4fe346cd08daae27c307%7ca8eec281aaa34daeac9b9a398b9215e7%7c0%7c0%7c638013783063215311%7cUnknown%7cTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7c3000%7c%7c%7c&sdata=ZdtLs6jKdBe3F9WZyHHGpDe2SXHTwVnCyAnQA/LLHLI%3D&reserved=0). These can assist in understanding disease and devising treatments that can help. In this study, to assess function, the brain organoid was implanted into a rat brain. Is it ethical to use rats as hosts for human neurons, possibly bits of the human brain? How much of the rat brain can, and should maximally, be replaced by human cells? The answers to these complex questions include data and opinion, ethics, in other words. Bravery - 10.7.22 In the building where I used to work, there was an alcove that was a nesting place for falcons. For a while, a falcon cam allowed community members to spy on the lovely birds even before they hatched. We saw the babies learn to pull apart a pigeon or duck their parent had provided, we watched their down replaced by big bird feathers. And we watched the adolescent falcons gearing up to fly. They would stretch their wings and run back and forth along the length of their space, getting the feel. After some days, if you were lucky, you could catch one of them standing at the edge of the alcove where it opened to the sky, flapping its wings, taking a little hop forward and then a hop back to safety. You could see the bird getting up courage, becoming brave enough to take the first flight. I never saw that but did see the nest empty next day. On the Novartis building across the street, were two falcons perching on the sign. They took off, circled and came back, maybe parent and fledgling, and the day after they were gone. Freedoms - 9.30.22 Freedom is a well-used word that carries weight, promise and challenge. I like the notion of three types of [freedom](https://warriorsway.com/three-types-of-freedom/#:~:text=There%20are%20three%20types%20of,we%20were%20meant%20to%20be.): \"freedom from,\" a freedom from constraints; \"freedom to,\" a freedom to do what we want to do; and \"freedom to be,\" not just to do what we want, but a freedom to be who we are. Then there are the [Four Freedoms](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2015/12/what-are-your-four-freedoms/) proposed by President Franklin D Roosevelt in 1941: freedom of speech and expression; freedom of worship; freedom from want and freedom from fear. All of these can provide a useful framework for real events, as Associate Dean for Equity, Randall Hughes and I discussed this week. Taking Time to Play - 9.23.22 Last week I joined a tour of the CILS Imaging Facility in ISEC, with the expert guidance of Professor James Monaghan (Biology). CILS is an important part of the Northeastern research landscape, and the Imaging Facility is wonderful, with highest tech microscopes, that can see deep into cells, often in a living animal. There are microscopes for K-12 students to experience the magic of imaging through Biobus-Northeastern, led by Assistant Professor Vivek Venkatachalam (Physics) and James Monaghan. It's the best imaging facility in Boston, and a great place to play. Finding Time for Yourself - 9.16.22 What an unbelievably busy, complex beginning of the semester. Regarding the Holmes Hall incident on Tuesday night, multiple law enforcement agencies have determined that the campus is safe and secure. As you know classes, research, and all other campus activities resumed on Wednesday, and continue. There is an ongoing investigation into the incident. 'Quiet quitting' is such a new term that Google searches for this began only in August. The idea though is not so new, and the term seems to mean 'doing the minimum to keep your job'. Welcome to the New Year! - 9.9.22 There is Mr. Dundon, handing out blue notebooks for the new year - Saxonwold School, fourth grade. You know them, flimsy blue 5\u00d78 lined notebooks, with deep significance because they are a chance for perfection. Unmarked, pristine, waiting to begin a flawless year. Of course, by lunchtime (cheese and tomato sandwich, apple) that path is lost, my name written crookedly on the cover and the first page already including crossings out. No surprise really. But the opportunity to be better, possibly perfect, in every new year never stops being enticing. 'How is your Summer?' 7.29.22 There are some bad things happening. Severe heat, terrible fires, and floods. Ongoing revelations about the shameful January 6 post-election events. Devastating fallout from rescinding abortion rights. Further racial violence. Harm and ominous threats to the LGBTQ+ community. COVID in its next wave, relentlessly continuing to impact so many lives. If you get sick, please rest plenty and take care until you are better. Helping to Fly the Plane - 8.26.22 One time, I was on a flight from Seattle to Phoenix, when darkness started moving down my head - from the top, into my forehead and approaching my eyes. I felt pressed into the seat, and it was hard to breathe. My first thought was that I was ill, but a glance at my neighbor showed she was feeling the same. A flight attendant was running up the aisle. Without warning the plane went into a steep descent and in seconds we could breathe, and the darkness was gone. Sometime later there was an announcement that we had lost pressure, and that both primary and backup systems had failed. Aha. My second thought was where were the oxygen masks? It seemed the perfect opportunity for these to deploy. A Troubling Start to Summer - 5.27.22 Whatever may be imperfect about our k-12 education system, school is wonderful. Caring teachers help you learn interesting things, you make some friends, and there is free breakfast and lunch if you need it. For some kids, school is a safer, less stressful place than home. And school is there, a reliable destination that parents count on every day. Power of Community - 5.20.22 This past week has been all about the power of Community. Northeastern Commencement at Fenway last Friday was brilliant: a mix of academic gravitas and joyous celebration. Our COS students all shone, but two stood out as part of the platform presentations. Tolu Faderin, a Behavioral Neuroscience major, gave a wrenchingly beautiful performance of the National Anthem, while Adwoa Sefah, a Cell and Molecular Biology major was the brilliant undergraduate student speaker. When I greeted College of Science graduates, their roar of celebration was also a shout of knowing that they belonged here in the College of Science at Northeastern University. Because of your teaching and mentoring, they will carry with them the good power of science and find a vast set of career possibilities. Congratulations!! Reinventing the PhD - 5.13.22 You surely remember your experience as a PhD student, and now, as faculty or staff you may have contact with our College of Science PhD trainees and see how they are doing. I remember being honored to have the opportunity of a place in graduate school, and incredulous that it was sponsored. The research was interesting but difficult, and I worked incredibly hard, sometimes alone in the lab at night and generally lonely. I had no idea what came next. My thesis is on a Richards office bookshelf, and although I'm proud of the work, I would say my PhD training was a mixed experience. Addressing Commencement - 5.6.22 This week, I am thinking what to tell our students in the College of Science Commencement Ceremony next Tuesday evening. Thank you to everyone participating! Thank You Enormously to Assistant Dean Amber Watson and Associate Director for Graduate Administration Melissa Rubock for their huge and expert work in organizing this. Writing a talk is always interesting. There should be a thread, and one take home message. The beginning is key. If you lose your audience then, you've lost them for good. There should be an arc and a return to the beginning to give a polished finish. I love to build talks out loud and to try lots of beginnings. Most get thrown out. But I don't worry, because there's so much possibility, so many stories to tell. At some point ideas coalesce and there's the thread. Northeastern Burlington Innovation Campus - 4.29.22 This Tuesday, a group of us (me, Associate Dean Erin Cram, Associate Dean Sam Inman, and Assistant Director of Space Planning and Safety Sarah Stanton) took a trip to our Northeastern [Innovation Campus at Burlington](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnortheastern.us12.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3Db4e7744d07bed3a062e958b16%26id%3D6ea18d7248%26e%3D2c969c1aac&data=05%7C01%7Cl.johnson%40northeastern.edu%7Cc43d92825b8b4913cec408da2a240af3%7Ca8eec281aaa34daeac9b9a398b9215e7%7C0%7C0%7C637868631547669278%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=cfg85LDl%2FGIQYeQJ53Ec3Cdjy9WxEGR1aoQCL3rCip4%3D&reserved=0). Burlington is a close Network site, but quite different from the hustle of our Boston campus. I've visited multiple times and admired the [Life Sciences Testing Center](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnortheastern.us12.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3Db4e7744d07bed3a062e958b16%26id%3D7750920b54%26e%3D2c969c1aac&data=05%7C01%7Cl.johnson%40northeastern.edu%7Cc43d92825b8b4913cec408da2a240af3%7Ca8eec281aaa34daeac9b9a398b9215e7%7C0%7C0%7C637868631547669278%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=6z%2FoTsW4ikNLPvchO9YoZjCWmVLtxc0PXExSnp52gkM%3D&reserved=0), but without the full tour. For now, there is free parking, and the 14-acres is open and quiet.

Kostas Institute (KRI); and Professor Deniz Erdogmus, CTO, KRI. Urban Wildlife - 4.22.22 Right outside my kitchen door on Tuesday was a turkey. It was smart in glossy brown, striped and spotted feathers, making its gobbling sound. My yard is fenced to keep the dog in, but the turkey had entered somehow, and now looked contemplatively at the neighbor's yard. It's amazing to me that turkeys can fly at all, given their shape, but it must be true, for in a moment the turkey was next door. Urban wildlife seems very important. Our urbane, campus squirrels foraging outside Cabot, the rabbits on the lawns by Curry, the confident robins all over, and bumble bees bravely seeking out Northeastern flowers outside Richards. They give us a true glimpse into a different life. For most people (and 70% of us now live in cities), it may be the only wildlife you see. The privilege of seeing an elephant or kudu in the wild is rare, and even in a zoo it's not so frequent, and can you truly love and respect animals you've never seen for real? Evolution and Religion - 4.15.22 When I was 21 and teaching Science in Neasden High School, London, I was volunteered for a debate titled 'Evolution vs Religion'. The venue was one of the science labs, which was incredibly noisy and packed with kids. My opponent was a dapper math teacher, who vociferously laid out his case that evolution was a failed theory, and that creation was the only truth. Armed with undergraduate knowledge, I bravely represented natural selection as more than a theory, but he was well-equipped with rhetoric. When the bell rang, my adversary huffed off, declaring himself victor. Awards - 4.8.22 The ability to [understand a reward](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnortheastern.us12.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3Db4e7744d07bed3a062e958b16%26id%3D60936f0cf0%26e%3Db6cda6c3c0&data=04%7C01%7Ce.merino%40northeastern.edu%7C45fa1c12122d4ee2ec3908da19aa1789%7Ca8eec281aaa34daeac9b9a398b9215e7%7C0%7C0%7C637850515588160434%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=h4h30brFuhBp6V1jkHqaiCB9RLIMeE2bHbBzb%2FFXL%2Fs%3D&reserved=0) goes way back in animal evolution, well before animals with backbones arose. The reward system is part of how we're motivated to get things done and includes some powerful neural circuits. Unfortunately, these same circuits become mis-directed in opioid or other [addictive disorders](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnortheastern.us12.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3Db4e7744d07bed3a062e958b16%26id%3Defd3324c25%26e%3Db6cda6c3c0&data=04%7C01%7Ce.merino%40northeastern.edu%7C45fa1c12122d4ee2ec3908da19aa1789%7Ca8eec281aaa34daeac9b9a398b9215e7%7C0%7C0%7C637850515588160434%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=Vtw9ISzudL3Llo341B21rL%2FUxlNa443mpyncU73KNiI%3D&reserved=0). In our day to day, as you know, rewards acknowledge something well done, like a small cup of salted caramel ice-cream when you finish putting together next week's homework problems or submit a Report on time. Awards are often more public than Rewards, often less delicious, and usually more formal with a citation. There are fewer Awards than rewards but let me say that every person in the College of Science deserves an Award for Important Contributions Made in AY21-22. Congratulations! to each of you, for how you contribute, collaborate, and connect across the College of Science and Northeastern University. Discovering the Unexpected - 4.1.22 How do you know what you don't know? At a deep level, understanding something really new is the foundation of scientific discovery. You poke around at the edge of your knowledge, and maybe a bit cracks open to reveal something unexpected.

But, and here's what's important, before he cleaned up, he noticed that some two-week old bacterial cultures had become infected with mold, and that the mold was killing the disease-causing bacteria. The mold contained the chemical penicillin, that went on to save more than a hundred million lives. It was careful looking and thinking about effects of vacation time on the bacteria that was crucial. Spring! - 3.25.22 The topic is Spring. The word is Frenetic. It's true in our schedules, and I feel like one of the birds in my garden, spending the entire day collecting, strategizing, doing. I know each of you is inundated with deadlines and challenges. As always, please accept my most sincere thanks for dealing with the huge workload, I know it is a lot. Please remember that your contribution is truly important to building the Good Power of Science. Spring is a reliable, expansive, explosion of cell division and growth, of every living thing waking up and getting going. Almost every religion or culture celebrates Spring. The push is enormous, as emphasized by a tree I passed once in Jamaica Plain, its base encased in concrete, harshly pruned to accommodate wires and walls, nonetheless enthusiastically sending out pale leaves and pink blossoms.

Wanting more magnification, I saw an advertisement in Scientific American for a book called Amateur Telescope Making and my dad allowed me to order it. It was a small book covered in grey paper, even today on my bookshelf. The local planetarium sold supplies, and following directions, I ground my own lenses by rotating two six-inch discs of glass against one another, so one became concave (the lens) and one convex. Next steps involved polishing the lens with increasingly fine emery paper and rouge, and then coating it with silver (from reduced silver nitrate) to make a mirror. The culmination was mounting the lens in a cardboard tube and attaching an eye piece. It didn't matter that the lens was not successful, and nothing was in focus, the thrill of having made my own telescope was enough.

Randall Hughes, Associate Dean for Equity and I provide this update for you on key new initiatives to promote a culture of respect and equity in the College of Science: - Educating and informing our community to prevent discrimination and harassment Discrimination and harassment are not tolerated in the College of Science. Each person belongs in our College, regardless of race, color, religion, religious creed, genetic information, sex, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, national origin, ancestry, veteran or disability status. Further, retaliation will not be tolerated against any person who in good faith makes a report of a prohibited offense. Any person who retaliates directly or indirectly against a victim, witness, person reporting a prohibited offense, a respondent and/or charged party, or any person involved in the investigation of a prohibited offense will be subject to discipline, up to and including termination (if an employee) or expulsion (if a student). Job Descriptions - 2.18.22 In a broad view, everything alive has a job, even if there is no written JD. What's the job of your students? I asked one semester, and each found it valuable to lay out personal reasons and goals for their university education. How about a third grader? A baby? Your dog? An ant? That's a provocative one. Gather food and materials, build the nest, keep it clean. Work as a team. Protect the pack. Sound familiar?! If we could ask, a tree would likely write that its JD is to make food, produce seeds, fend off insect attacks, and connect with other trees. On the other hand, you might think that a tree's job is to provide shade and wood, and to help modulate the climate, highlighting an important thing about JDs. They can depend on your perspective. What you think is your job, may not be the same as your supervisor's view, which is why goal setting and mid-year reviews are useful all around. The Excellence of Snow - 2.11.22 Science is the Olympics of discovery and application. The teacher who constructs a course with elegance and insight, the researcher addressing a question with stunning logic and brilliant interpretation, are some of our Gold Medalists. Often, we play team sports, working together to the finish line of scientific solutions. Excellence in Science is as breath-taking as Chloe Kim's half-pipe skill or Nathan Chen's quads. It's what we work towards. But we know that in the Olympics, most athletes win no medals, and even being able to stay upright while skating on your local rink counts a lot! Everyone's contribution is award-winning when it comes to promoting excellence in our College and at Northeastern University, across teaching, research, and expert administration. Thank you everyone for participating in the Winter Olympics of Science! The Wheel of Time - 2.4.22 Like fantasy villages, in the College of Science, we often know each other's names (and can readily introduce ourselves!), and when we need special help, we seek out the expert - in HR, Grants Administration and so on. Indeed, our culture of respect values each person as an individual who brings their expertise and diverse background to fulfill our mission. Much of our expertise is held in Departments, which are 'collections of expertise', each of which is a 'discipline,' meaning 'a branch of knowledge'. The notion of scientific disciplines stretches back to the dawn of universities, and has become labeled as a dusty, old-fashioned concept. This is totally wrong. Far from being dusty, disciplines are vibrant collections of state-of-the-art expertise, that can be put together with that from other disciplines, to learn something wonderful. No-one can know everything, that's why we have scholars who understand algebraic geometry, quantum theory, stem cells, molecular structure, brain circuitry or coastal ecosystems. Understanding how to use this knowledge requires another type of discipline, the hard work kind, that always has valuable outcomes, and why our trainees benefit from some disciplinary education.

Projections from our Network Science Institute led by Prof. Alessandro Vespignani indicate that the Omicron surge will [peak by mid-January](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnortheastern.us12.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3Db4e7744d07bed3a062e958b16%26id%3D627d9ce755%26e%3Db6cda6c3c0&data=04%7C01%7Ce.merino%40northeastern.edu%7C3931bfc69e884cd4e6fb08d9d2288d2d%7Ca8eec281aaa34daeac9b9a398b9215e7%7C0%7C0%7C637771893894679491%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=8FpQiVsAgMLil7QNcyW%2FgW%2FWSI2NB42Qyqt3jvu9pbc%3D&reserved=0), which is good news for the rest of the semester. But some of you and your families will become infected, and some of your students. Please use high quality N95 or KN94/95 masks to help protect yourselves. How will you help absent students continue their learning, how will you cover your class or other work if you need to quarantine or are feeling ill? How can we encourage students who have lost so much opportunity for learning? All the while, please pay attention to your well-being. Running the semester is a huge responsibility, and the only way we'll succeed is by working together and supporting one another. Further thoughts are below, and we'll discuss this in our COS Community Meeting next week. Warmest Wishes for a Peaceful Holiday - 12/17/21 It is stunning how tough this year has been. Again. We pray that your family and friends in Kentucky and neighboring states are safe. How relentless the bad news, the demands, the challenges. It is stunning how hard you are all working. But it's also stunning to see your successes. Every week I am thrilled to learn of your innovative teaching approaches. Of outstanding advising. Of top-quality organization and stewardship across the College. Of donations from wonderful supporters. I'm honored to see the prestigious awards and research grants our faculty have won. Every week I learn of your amazing research findings. In this tough time, the power of Higher Education, of Good Science and our work has only increased in importance - to guide students towards a productive yet peaceful life, and to contribute solutions towards the toughest problems on earth.

The Magic of Science - 12/10/21 Some years ago, I organized a conference on Developmental Biology and set it to music. The opener was ['It's a Kind of Magic'](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3D-dWGTpSa2yw&data=04%7c01%7cr.patrizi%40northeastern.edu%7ca4ef0f0223dd4204f6e408d9bc210685%7ca8eec281aaa34daeac9b9a398b9215e7%7c0%7c0%7c637747672303038909%7cUnknown%7cTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7c3000&sdata=I2Eg2x/RTfDmRcQuQLLWcnTIVu5CyDKounVmS8wLQBI%3D&reserved=0), by my favorite band Queen. The audience seemed taken aback at being blasted with rock music, but I wanted to acknowledge that the embryo seems truly magical. Every talk was based on the extraordinary truth that each of us came from one tiny starter cell, that made 100 trillion more cells, and those built themselves into your organs, which connect seamlessly to make your whole self.

Restfulness and Obligation - 12/3/21 It is the nightmare of every family, every friend. Someone you love goes out and does not come home. Ahmaud Arbery went out for a run, and never came home. Some men shot and killed him while he was peacefully jogging, because he was a Black man. Almost, they got away with the murder, but sometimes, our legal system [prevails](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https://northeastern.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u%3Db4e7744d07bed3a062e958b16%26id%3Dade31c3460%26e%3D9070f3b8b1&data=04%7c01%7cr.patrizi%40northeastern.edu%7ce8b3be44517d409732f908d9b69aef9a%7ca8eec281aaa34daeac9b9a398b9215e7%7c0%7c0%7c637741598971401052%7cUnknown%7cTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7c3000&sdata=%2BBuU6aj8Lu4PqkhEMX07RzWxqQl6o4hvCT%2BlBfDfkD4%3D&reserved=0) and the murderers were [convicted](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https://northeastern.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u%3Db4e7744d07bed3a062e958b16%26id%3Dc3839fde83%26e%3D9070f3b8b1&data=04%7c01%7cr.patrizi%40northeastern.edu%7ce8b3be44517d409732f908d9b69aef9a%7ca8eec281aaa34daeac9b9a398b9215e7%7c0%7c0%7c637741598971411044%7cUnknown%7cTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7c3000&sdata=1NIDvhaSadapQ8LTkXQAT1yuXhWsT/MyxhmPtJtcV44%3D&reserved=0) just before Thanksgiving. There is no waking from this nightmare, but there is some justice and retribution to slightly temper the heartbreak of losing Ahmaud Arbery. I thought about violence and justice while in rural Vermont last week, where I saw almost no-one on my daily walks. There were snowflakes periodically, and bare trees soft grey as they slept. In the winter countryside, the night is wonderfully dark and the quiet almost total. It's easy to rest there, to be restored and good to remember that the constant barrage of heinous or hateful acts reported in the news does not permeate everywhere. I hope your Thanksgiving was similarly peaceful.

President Aoun recounted the emotional context of shutting down everything back in March 2020, while Chef Ming Tsai urged everyone to make kindness a central part of their lives. Totally. We are all trying so hard, accomplishing, failing, learning, trying again. Being kind and encouraging is the only way to go. We observe the Thanksgiving holiday with prayers of remembrance and gratitude. We remember those we personally lost, ever loved and in our hearts. We may be filled with gratitude - I am grateful that we can meet in person again, even amidst the continuing COVID threat. I am enormously grateful for your partnership in moving the College of Science forward, for the good of all its members, and for the good of Northeastern University.

Power of Higher Education - 11/05/21 Education is wonderful work, important and exciting, but also difficult and intense. And this semester is unlike any other. The COVID-class of students is upon us. Across multiple departments, I am hearing of students not equipped to deal with their academics, perhaps because the last two years of high school involved lackluster online learning, even cheating, just to get by in the frightening, unreal pandemic. And that missing education is showing now, across all levels. It puts a huge stress on students not equipped for their rigorous Northeastern academics. And it puts a huge stress on you, our faculty, who are burned out, even mid-way through the semester, after eighteen months of relentless and changing teaching needs, and sometimes larger class sizes to meet our huge enrolment increase. What enormous pressure for faculty who are trying to do what you love and to meet your own high standards under difficult circumstances. Thank you to everyone in our departments who is strategizing how to help students succeed in their classes and qualifications, in the face of these unprecedented challenges. Balancing Time - 10/29/21 I've never understood the term 'work-life balance'. Are we not alive while at work? Sometimes this is called 'work-leisure balance'. For those of you who rush home to the unpaid job of parenting or other caregiving, the notion of work-leisure balance is a bad joke. But there is something important here - a comfortable time distribution between your job in the Northeastern College of Science and the rest - maybe an 'individual time balance'. In the odd 'work-life balance' term, there's a 'work is bad' connotation, that is wrong for me, and I hope for all of you. I think work is wonderful! What a great opportunity we have - to empower students and to promote the highest quality research in the framework of good Science. Working together, we are building excellence in every sphere. Every job in our College is important, and thank you everyone, for your contributions to meeting our exciting, groundbreaking College and Northeastern University goals. The Languages of Science - 10/22/21 How do we build the future of the COS? I like building from the ground up, so started by asking 'what is a College of Science'? Interestingly, I could find no general definition, so looked more broadly for definitions of ['Science'](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https://northeastern.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u%3Db4e7744d07bed3a062e958b16%26id%3Df1588edc40%26e%3D9070f3b8b1&data=04%7c01%7cr.patrizi%40northeastern.edu%7c03b1f91ca50d46ee1e0e08d995a2e48d%7ca8eec281aaa34daeac9b9a398b9215e7%7c0%7c0%7c637705349410808353%7cUnknown%7cTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7c1000&sdata=oR6KOcR4EmCWn%2BrypM8PiOOiL0yNH%2BrM0hGFuV/N1XU%3D&reserved=0) . The results were totally boring, for example: 'Science (from Latin scientia 'knowledge') is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the world'. Is 'Science' then, and our College of Science an artificial construct, or a relic from long ago? Absolutely not! There is a living, important and wonderful framework for Science, and for a College of Science. Some time ago, I formulated a set of \"Great Languages\" and ranked them according to broadest usage. There is no judgment in this ranking, just a semi-quantitative 'usage' metric, and it's fun to use different size fonts to represent usage. My terming of language is \"a set of related concepts and principles, forming a grammar and vocabulary, that can be used to communicate, create and answer questions\". By this schema, the most used Great Languages are Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry since they are languages of the entire Universe. Biology is certainly the language of our planet, governing all life on earth. The 'Human Languages', no less important to people, are the ones you might think of first - Spanish, English, Chinese etc together with the languages of humanities, arts and design - Philosophy, History, Music etc. Coding comprises a set of recent languages, with increasing usage. Engineering is a powerful synthesis of many languages. My fellow Deans can frame the crucial landscapes of their Colleges brilliantly, the only goal here is to frame the College of Science. Gender Equity - 10/15/21 Our faculty members include brilliant women across every sphere of Science and at every level. But we need to worry why women are so poorly represented in many departments. For example, in the tenure stream, our Physics and Mathematics department faculty run below 15% women, and in Chemistry only 25%. These numbers are representative of most universities indicating the attrition of talented women in these areas, at stages of training before they would enter academia. The underlying reasons are complex but have a lot to do with expectations from even before birth, early childhood education, k-12 schooling, societal stereotyping, lack of access to affordable childcare, and rigid academic tracks. Our College can't fix everything, but we can fix academic landscapes - we think that women faculty percentages will increase after reworking archaic practices, by hiring right out of the PhD, by hiring cohorts, promoting collaborative research and devising tenure assessments that acknowledge teamwork. All of course, within a culture of respect, where everyone listens carefully to one another, and respects the contributions of every College member. Celebrating the Truth - 10/08/21 You may remember the Ministry of Truth in George Orwell's book [1984](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnortheastern.us12.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3Db4e7744d07bed3a062e958b16%26id%3D812cf59da9%26e%3D9070f3b8b1&data=04%7C01%7Cr.patrizi%40northeastern.edu%7Cca43e0d41d6940684a6b08d98a8e59fd%7Ca8eec281aaa34daeac9b9a398b9215e7%7C0%7C0%7C637693166272920949%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=ancd6NSwJjFZ5O27jTs9ODRtKZ0Nw4JvSJR%2BioahNJs%3D&reserved=0). They had the job to rewrite history, so it fit the propaganda. It was where Winston Smith worked, who became so disgusted with his assignment and society that he sought to escape, and find the real truth (unfortunately, with no happy ending). I wonder often what is 'real'. When I need something unequivocal, the maple tree in my yard is a help - the rough bark under each finger and the view up the high trunk confirm with every sense that this is real. But assessing the truth behind news reports, history, or anecdotes is so difficult that 'fake news' is now a scholarly field. Tenure - 10/01/21 By the time I came up for tenure consideration, what I cared about was that my research group had made really interesting findings. We had asked how organs of the body get put in the correct place, or as a student subtitled his thesis: 'why your brain is not in your big toe'. This topic is both fascinating but also crucial for families seeking causes of birth anomalies. I cared about the wonderfully bright group of trainees who had chosen to work with me, and that I had been able to raise funds to support the work. Tenure was a milestone, but not the point. The thing you may know about tenure is that it comes with a very long term contract. University tenure is [described by the AAUP](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https://northeastern.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u%3Db4e7744d07bed3a062e958b16%26id%3D1c9af3e3da%26e%3D9070f3b8b1&data=04%7c01%7cr.patrizi%40northeastern.edu%7cfb8792f465c04831499e08d9851ac16b%7ca8eec281aaa34daeac9b9a398b9215e7%7c0%7c0%7c637687172690192693%7cUnknown%7cTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7c1000&sdata=/%2Biw355tEvQXmUMVERAXUKj8YGLezogPtgRBxscZDFQ%3D&reserved=0) as originating to protect 'academic freedom' allowing faculty the ability to express opinion without fear of retribution. I had thought tenure was like academic regalia, dating back 1,000 years, but actually it is quite new, beginning in the 1940s. Tenure has been criticized as not useful, unfair, and responsible for [promoting narrow, elitist research](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https://northeastern.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u%3Db4e7744d07bed3a062e958b16%26id%3Dd60212d7b7%26e%3D9070f3b8b1&data=04%7c01%7cr.patrizi%40northeastern.edu%7cfb8792f465c04831499e08d9851ac16b%7ca8eec281aaa34daeac9b9a398b9215e7%7c0%7c0%7c637687172690192693%7cUnknown%7cTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7c1000&sdata=Mi9aHOyy9SUCnBIjRU4QSlRT6wz4fLEJXQ%2BmlKeeFd4%3D&reserved=0). Indeed, shorter contracts can be a reasonable substitute. But I think with proper understanding and mechanism, tenure remains a viable system, that can maximize the high impact research carried out at a university. The Slow Way to the Moon - 9/24/21 The only part of the movie AD ASTRA I liked was the beginning, a commercial flight to the moon, that seemed pretty accurate. It looked as uncomfortable as regular air travel, except that pillows and blankets ran $500. When you arrived, there was an escalator, a sign at the top reading [Welcome to the Moon](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnortheastern.us12.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3Db4e7744d07bed3a062e958b16%26id%3D1f96bc8949%26e%3D9070f3b8b1&data=04%7C01%7Cr.patrizi%40northeastern.edu%7C8c22bcbe883d47dfe8a608d97fa23598%7Ca8eec281aaa34daeac9b9a398b9215e7%7C0%7C0%7C637681157222371081%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=CXR0c7R7AQo1BEgi8UjfdcHy35WlO%2BdaVG4KpOy4eoM%3D&reserved=0) (0.10-0.22), and security with dogs in the arrival hall. The car ride after was cool, an open rover driving along the dusty moonscape under a pitch-black sky and earth hanging there. It was not clear how long that future trip took, but generally moon flights carrying people run about three days, and a lot of fuel, to cover the quarter million miles from earth. Did you know though, that there's a [slow way to the moon](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnortheastern.us12.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3Db4e7744d07bed3a062e958b16%26id%3D55ed9e1710%26e%3D9070f3b8b1&data=04%7C01%7Cr.patrizi%40northeastern.edu%7C8c22bcbe883d47dfe8a608d97fa23598%7Ca8eec281aaa34daeac9b9a398b9215e7%7C0%7C0%7C637681157222381085%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=smDQqjyehIMrjFwZfeBYZzVofEK56bzoRKGjL2ec2KU%3D&reserved=0)? It takes around four weeks and uses much less energy. Rather than the straight shot of escaping earth's gravity and heading on a direct path to the moon, the slow way puts a craft into increasingly wider elliptical orbit around earth, using earth's gravity to push the apogee further and further from earth, and closer and closer to the moon. Eventually the craft is [captured by the moon's gravity](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnortheastern.us12.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3Db4e7744d07bed3a062e958b16%26id%3D0a981fe520%26e%3D9070f3b8b1&data=04%7C01%7Cr.patrizi%40northeastern.edu%7C8c22bcbe883d47dfe8a608d97fa23598%7Ca8eec281aaa34daeac9b9a398b9215e7%7C0%7C0%7C637681157222381085%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=2mbUkP78Gcvr4TCS5MeWiC9zjYc3fKhAavhxfXnp7rY%3D&reserved=0) and switches into moon orbit.

I had vaguely discounted them as a run of the mill pop group until I came across an interview with Barry Gibb, the last living member, and started digging around. In fact, their music is fantastic (click on the *links), and as a bonus, their interesting story suggested some excellent tips for Science research. From modest beginnings in England, and later Australia, the Gibb brothers - Barry, and twins Maurice and Robin - formed the BeeGees and were pre-teen TV stars with confidence and great harmonies. Back in England the group became hugely successful, largely by popularizing 'disco' through their [Saturday Night Fever](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnortheastern.us12.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3Db4e7744d07bed3a062e958b16%26id%3D4ae41557e5%26e%3Db6cda6c3c0&data=04%7C01%7Ce.merino%40northeastern.edu%7Cf48327768c534836724208d97a2e5e3d%7Ca8eec281aaa34daeac9b9a398b9215e7%7C0%7C0%7C637675161866133065%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=CcebK5phg3IvaR4G6savv3AanUur8h99M520owPOpIQ%3D&reserved=0)* score (although the genre later became a racist/homophobic [target](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnortheastern.us12.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3Db4e7744d07bed3a062e958b16%26id%3D1326300466%26e%3Db6cda6c3c0&data=04%7C01%7Ce.merino%40northeastern.edu%7Cf48327768c534836724208d97a2e5e3d%7Ca8eec281aaa34daeac9b9a398b9215e7%7C0%7C0%7C637675161866143028%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=16y01A7Dc9giguqlROkZIFB1hSzboZ5pyPJA9H6jx4k%3D&reserved=0)). For 27 consecutive weeks in 1978, seven songs written by the brothers were #1 on the US charts, and they held five of the top ten slots for even longer. Eventually, radio hosts refused to play their songs and held BeeGees-free weekends! The parallels between the effective BeeGees working style and the important collaborative research we're promoting at Northeastern are quite interesting. For example... A Full Experience - 9/10/21 The term 'normal' is loaded. Some years ago, my research group explored this as applied to neurodevelopmental and mental health disorders, that our studies address. We quickly decided that 'normal' should be removed from our vocabulary, since it implied 'correct' or 'best' and 'abnormal' implied something opposite. In fact, we were part of a wave of understanding, and terminology has become 'affected' and 'unaffected' as pertain to most disorders. These more recent terms acknowledge differences between people, that although many of us are affected by some mental or physical challenge, none of us is 'abnormal', and I am deeply glad that term has dissipated. 'Normal' cannot describe this new academic year either, as we cautiously learn to live with COVID. At Convocation on Monday, our new undergraduates, masked and vaccinated, were thrilled to join Northeastern in person, totally excited to be Huskies. President Aoun promised our students [ a 'full experience'](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnortheastern.us12.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3Db4e7744d07bed3a062e958b16%26id%3Dac228ab3c3%26e%3D9070f3b8b1&data=04%7C01%7Cr.patrizi%40northeastern.edu%7C70d7ea2c556c41229bf408d9749e00df%7Ca8eec281aaa34daeac9b9a398b9215e7%7C0%7C0%7C637669044258420439%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=zGjK%2FoktMaENXJ2L4hg90sSZF2SdzfmnnoNv5c9L47U%3D&reserved=0), which is a brilliant way to put it.

Northeastern has been a paradigm for how to keep the full experience going in the face of a global disaster, and each member of our community should be truly proud to have contributed to this effort. Important Lives - 8/20/21 You know the scenario - while turning on the shower, a moth flutters up. It's one of those beautiful white ones with wings carefully outlined in black and small yellow spots on either side. But moths are not built for water, and a drop or two sadly sends the little animal down the drain. Every life is important, and this week brings ongoing news of many lives in danger. In the fires of the western US, earthquakes in Haiti, the turmoil in Afghanistan, tropical storms in our country and abroad, in the rising number of COVID cases. We send warm wishes for the safety of your family and friends in these regions or affected by the virus. Meetings - 7/23/21 When was your first meeting? Preschool maybe, when you were in the Moonbeam class? Morning Meeting, with a hello song and what was going to happen that day. You picked at your socks, drew on the soles if you had a crayon. Because Morning Meeting was a little slow. And you wanted to get going and do stuff, preferably pedal a tricycle on the outside track as fast as possible.

But perhaps the best part of summer is pulling on a trusty pair of flipflops, my unconstrained toes enjoying seasonal freedom! Out of COVID, Into Summer - 5/28/2021 Here in Massachusetts, we have the highest percentage of vaccinated people of any US state, so we are feeling safer and more confident. Restrictions are easing, and at Northeastern in accord with state guidelines, [masks will soon be optional everywhere for fully vaccinated people](https://news.northeastern.edu/2021/05/19/northeastern-to-lift-mask-wearing-physical-distancing-requirements-on-massachusetts-campuses-by-memorial-day/). [You are not required to remove your mask.](https://news.northeastern.edu/coronavirus/reopening/vaccine/) Indeed, for certain medical conditions, the guidance is to be careful. I plan to keep masked in various places, not only because a smart cloth mask has become part of my dress, but because it can be private and protective. Over the upcoming flu and cold season, we all might do well to keep a mask or two at hand. Please do whatever is comfortable, within Northeastern guidelines. Thank you for the honor of this collegial, productive, mind-expanding first year at Northeastern - 5/21/2021 Almost one year ago, on June 1, 2020, I became your Dean. It was a week after Mr. George Floyd had been murdered by police on May 25, and in the midst of a terrifying global pandemic. Northeastern was new to me, as was our College and almost all of you. I was your fourth Dean in almost the same number of years. It was clear that if we were to go forward in the landscape of racial injustice and within the uncertain pandemic framework, we needed to work together as one Community. We needed an overarching value of respect, with a clear statement against systemic racism and towards an equitable College. Over the year, we've met mostly as 1\u00d71 flat images, and I much look forward to seeing you in person. You've come to know me - that I have a funny accent, am very positive, and a hands-on Dean full of ideas, who is always thrilled to hear new ones! I have come to understand the top-quality research that is performed by many of you, the top-quality education you give our students and the top-quality administration and staffing that runs our departments and units. Northeastern was my destination because it seemed the most innovative university around, a place where we could invent the future of higher education, and that is true! Northeastern has become my home, and I am so happy to be part of this great College and University. Congratulations! You've done it! - 5/14/2021 My favorite piece of philosophy is the short essay by Albert Camus, [The Myth of Sisyphus](http://dbanach.com/sisyphus.htm). Camus looks into the bleakest situations and comes out with a positive view. Sisyphus was condemned to roll a boulder uphill forever, a dismal existence, but Camus understands that the effort Sisyphus makes is the point of his life. At the end he concludes: 'The struggle itself toward the heights is enough to fill a man's heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy.' I have a printed stack of this essay ready to give to anyone whose confidence is down, who is in need of encouragement. It's encouraging to understand that your effort to achieve is enough (and usually gets you somewhere). At Northeastern and in the College of Science, we are re-thinking higher education and the university - 5/7/2021 This is graduation week! With exciting in person processions all week on campus, and Commencement in person on Saturday and Sunday at Fenway, how great is this! Again, Northeastern is leading the way, with many universities opting for virtual graduation ceremonies. I am honored to present our College of Science graduates, and my cap, gown and hood are ready. This is a time for CONGRATULATIONS, and my greatest gratitude to each of you who has taught, guided, facilitated and inspired our students. There would be no graduation without you. Thank you, thank you, thank you. The notion of degrees is as old as universities, with the [University of Bologna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Bologna), Italy in continuous operation from the 11th century granting the first degrees. This week I addressed several College graduation celebrations, including the following, generalized for this letter. You can count on the power of Science - 4/30/2021 We are watching with deepest concern as India is ravaged by COVID-19, and now South American countries are contributing a large percentage of global COVID cases. We extend heartfelt and most sincere hopes for an improved situation to our College of Science faculty, staff and students who have family and friends in India, or in other countries severely affected. We hope that international efforts to send medical supplies and vaccination materials will rapidly assist. [Here are some ideas](https://www.nytimes.com/article/india-covid-how-to-help.html?searchResultPosition=1) you can consider to help India through this crisis. Let's make every day Earth Day - 4/23/2021 When I was a student, a requirement for the Zoology major was the Insect Project. You had to collect at least 100 different insects, kill them in a bottle with ethyl acetate, and mount them according to convention using pins and a cork board. I collected 100 exactly, because I did not want to kill more than the minimum, but some of my classmates built elaborate cabinets and presented thousands of different species, some quite rare. Professor Passmore told our class that insects would be the last animal group to survive on earth (after the feared nuclear wars). You can irradiate them and they are untouched, he told us. They will survive anything. I must have had that notion firmly in my mind, because it was an enormous jolt to learn a few years ago that the insects of our planet were in [drastic, devastating decline](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/10/plummeting-insect-numbers-threaten-collapse-of-nature). There has been a 2.5% decrease in insect mass per year for the last 25-30 years, even in what are considered pristine forests. Extrapolating, within a century there will be none, zero insects. This outcome is thought to result from destroying habitats, especially by agriculture, compounded by pesticide use. Without insects as food, huge numbers of bird, frog, lizard and mammalian species will not survive. Neither will the many predators of the insect eaters. Many flowers will not be pollinated, impacting our food and crops. With this knowledge, last summer, while driving along I-93 towards Vermont, I noticed a butterfly flying on the side of the highway, and realized how daunting to be that small animal, confronted by a wide, busy road with nowhere to alight. Solving the greatest challenges of our planet - 4/16/2021 We're surrounded by complex problems, in science, in society and often across science and society. If you're looking for a definition, 'complex problems are solvable only through multiple approaches and disciplines'. You know some of the complex problems waiting to be solved - climate change, racism, homelessness, 'a cure for cancer'. When these problems become political, there is pressure to find a quick fix, but that does not exist, and the absence is construed as failure. Life's best moments are about taking small but empowering steps - 4/9/21 Right at the start of the pandemic, last March, when we were truly terrified, and the whole thing seemed a nightmare in which we were stuck, I was walking my now routine loop. Dropped on the sidewalk was a Ziploc bag of green grapes - twelve, taken off their stalks. Some water droplets told me these were carefully washed, perhaps someone was taking them to work, perhaps an essential worker. I walked by, but kept imagining what would happen - over days the grapes would start to rot, and someone would stand on them to make a squishy mess. This bothered me so much that next day I went back. The grapes were untouched, and I opened the bag then tumbled them onto the verge. I took the bag home, washed it and put it in my ready-to-use box. Next day, two of the grapes had disappeared, three the next, then all were gone. I suspected a family of racoons I'd seen crossing the road nearby had been pleased to find the delicious fruit. The whole thing made me feel a bit better, that even in this unbelievably scary moment, one could take a tiny step of useful action. Hooray for RNA - 4/2/2021 This week I had my first COVID-19 RNA vaccine shot - Pfizer, at a CVS in Belmont. The nurse was top notch and the store employees serious about running an efficient, careful process. The nurse noted that everyone was excited to get their shot (me, too). I was pleased that my arm hurt after, suggesting that my body is responding to viral Spike protein made because of RNA in the vaccine, and starting to produce protective anti-viral antibodies. Back in my thesis days, it would have been hard to imagine hundreds of millions of people being injected with vaccines made of bits of RNA packed in fat droplets. When I was a PhD student, describing the medical applications of RNA in a grant proposal was wishful thinking. Revising our pandemic brain circuitry - 3/26/21 During the COVID pandemic, we have done a lot of learning. You probably now readily remember to wear a mask when you go outside, and you avoid getting too close to non-pod people without thinking twice. The landscape is quite familiar, because each of us has formed some new neural circuitry. We have also been enormously stressed, and [Covid Stress Syndrome](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7252157/) is real. Please take care of your mental health, and seek help as you need it. There is writing now on [fear of being normal](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/03/09/weve-adjusted-pandemic-life-now-we-face-anxiety-leaving-it-behind/), post-COVID. Some of this has to do with revising our pandemic brain circuitry and it will be a jolt to try and lose this. I can't now imagine feeling comfortable going out mask-less. It will help to reactivate pleasant, socializing circuits that have been dormant for a year. We will have to build up again these old pathways, even while remnants of the pandemic persist. Every person is valued - 3/19/2021 Once more this week, we witnessed horrific violence against Asian people. This morning Associate Dean Randall Hughes and I sent to the entire College a letter (included in our March 5 Update) that reiterates College support for our Asian community, consistent with the message this week from President Aoun. The College of Science is committed to a culture of respect and action towards equity, and is a place where every person is valued, and where each person belongs. A varied society - 3/5/2021 There has been disturbing news lately about hate crimes against Asian people.

One year ago, the World Health Organization [acknowledged](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https://northeastern.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u%3Db4e7744d07bed3a062e958b16%26id%3D1de3d17659%26e%3D9070f3b8b1&data=04%7c01%7cr.patrizi%40northeastern.edu%7c95189a2e4b434613f78708d8e5a1129c%7ca8eec281aaa34daeac9b9a398b9215e7%7c0%7c0%7c637511827264120925%7cUnknown%7cTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7c1000&sdata=M7SvIpkPJ%2Bv0utsgz3zRk3DQxLlX3Z203ffhJEbusyE%3D&reserved=0) a worrying new infectious disease, and we locked down to avoid catching and spreading it. Perseverance Award - 2/26/2021 The Martian lander, [Perseverance](https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/) has a name fitting this past year. It was launched in the depths of the pandemic, July 2020 and made the long trek to Mars, arriving last week. The [landing video](https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/multimedia/videos/?v=461) is so exciting, and I especially like the end where you see the scientists celebrating in the JPL control room. They are women, men and people of varied races, a huge shift from the early uniform demographic of NASA personnel. The rich 'connectome' of our College - 2/19/2021 The still brilliant TV series ['Connections'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connections_%28TV_series%29#Connections_%281978%29) explores how current technologies were shaped by contributions from historical, geographical and societal landscapes, over thousands of years. Host James Burke poses complex questions like 'how did the touchstone (early money) make square sails obsolete, develop the compass and lead to invention of radar?' Take a look, the episodes are on YouTube and as surprising as ever. They remind us how discoveries in science often lead in unanticipated, important directions. A smooth Spring semester - 2/12/2021 We are moving towards Spring! I am sure of this, because even in the frigid weather, the sunlight is staying longer each day, and there is no need for a flashlight on my dog's afternoon walk. I am sure we are moving towards Spring because there are buds on the rhododendrons and magnolias, magical groups of cells waiting for the moment they can wake up, and make flowers. Honoring Black scientists - 2/5/2021 This is Black History Month, and a time to affirm our College of Science and Northeastern commitment to anti-racist policies, to a culture of respect, to action against systemic racism and towards equity. We are working hard, and I want to thank every person in the College who is participating in our sincere efforts to meet these goals. Pandemic Lessons - 1/29/2021 I wrote this a while ago for a story slam, and it seems pertinent to where we are today. \"One evening last fall I drove down a hill on Commonwealth Avenue to a striking sunset scene - a flock of birds silhouetted against the bright orange sky. It occurred to me then, that I was going home and the birds were going home, and the bees were at home and the chipmunks. Happy New Year - 1/22/2021 The morning air has a special sharpness that I love. I think there must be a chemistry involved - an ionization driven by the new light, perhaps?

Making the Dream Real - 1/15/2021 I was in elementary school when Nobel Laureate, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in 1968. The news crossed the world to South Africa, from where the United States seemed a distant dream. It was a big deal though, because we knew Dr. King's death was a blow for the Black civil rights movement in the United States. Gracious Professionalism - 1/8/21 The storming of the Capitol was extraordinary both in that the President encouraged this type of behavior, and in that it was possible to so easily breach security. It was extraordinary, but consistent with our history of white supremacy, that the police were so gentle with the mostly white protesters. We have seen the violence consistently inflicted on Black protesters by police. There is no doubt in my mind that had the storming been carried out by Black people, the outcomes would have been far worse. For me, these events also highlight that being a good loser is a useful part of life. Losing is a tough and frequent life lesson, that we generally have to politely accept, and try to learn from each instance. Mr. Trump unfortunately, seems not have learned this lesson. An Extraordinary Effort - 12/18/2020 Speaking of famous Huskies, Balto was a Siberian Husky, a sled dog who is immortalized by a statue in New York's Central Park. The story is complicated, and [a petition](https://www.change.org/p/mayor-bill-de-blasio-replace-balto-statue-with-togo-statue-in-central-park-the-true-hero) indicates that the statue should have depicted another Husky named Togo. But the point is one of hope: an extraordinary effort to bring diptheria antitoxin to Nome, Alaska in 1925, so stopping the outbreak of a terrible illness. Due to a blizzard, planes could not fly and the antitoxin was carried six hundred and seventy-four miles through driving snow and -20oF temperatures by dog sled teams. Balto (or maybe Togo) was the lead dog on the final leg of the dangerous trip.
