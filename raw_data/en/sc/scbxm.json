Today, more of us than ever are discovering the curative powers of energy medicine. Scientific studies continue to confirm its validity, and medical doctors are regularly prescribing treatments such as acupuncture to their patients. But even for those of us who have benefitted from such treatments, the question remains: what exactly is energy medicine, and how does it work? Acupuncturist and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) scholar Jill Blakeway has been treating patients for more than twenty-five years. For Jill, the term 'energy medicine' refers to the wide range of healing modalities used to diagnose and treat illness by manipulating the energy \u2014 the vital life force referred to as 'qi' in TCM \u2014 that pulses through the cells of our bodies. But even this seasoned practitioner admits she doesn't truly understand how some of her patients are healed under her care, and retains a healthy scepticism about her own abilities as well as those of her peers. In Energy Medicine, Jill invites us on her global journey to better understand, apply, and explain this powerful healing force. Moving from her own clinic to the halls of academia, she talks to top healers, researchers, and practitioners \u2014 from the Stanford and Princeton professors researching the physics behind energy medicine and healing; to a Chinese Qi Gong master who manifests healing herbs directly from her palm; to a team of sceptical scientists who use 'hands on' healing to repeatedly cure mammary cancer in mice. She also tells the story of how she discovered energy medicine and became one of the most sought-after healers in the world. Lively, entertaining, and informative, told in Jill's funny, relatable, and wholly grounded voice, Energy Medicine bridges the gap between science and spirituality and offers a persuasive, evidence-based case that advances this ancient healing practice. 'In Energy Medicine, Jill Blakeway shares not only her considerable knowledge but also her life's journey, taking the reader by the hand on an exploration of the science and practice of energy healing. As entertaining as it is rigorous, this is a book that both educates and enlightens.' Frank Lipman, MD, bestselling author of The New Health Rules and How to be Well 'In Energy Medicine, Jill Blakeway deftly explains the vital role of energy in all living things, showing us how it influences our health in mind and body as well as how it connects us to one another. A fascinating and illuminating read from one of the [United States'] top practitioners of energy medicine.' Mark Hyman, MD, bestselling author of Eat Fat, Get Thin [View all reviews](#) 'As a patient who has been blessed to experience Jill Blakeway's incredible energy firsthand, I can attest that she is a gifted healer. In Energy Medicine she validates what we know to be true intuitively \u2014 that the body has the power to heal itself \u2014 and offers readers the tools to understand and access the subtle energy within us. Far from a mystical tract, this book provides a true scientific investigation of the energy that exists within each of us and connects us to one another.' Uma Thurman 'Blakeway's personal telling of the healing powers of Eastern-borne medicines is filled with data and clinically backed research, an inspiring read for those wanting to learn more about alternative therapies.'
