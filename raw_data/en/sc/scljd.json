VISION Alameda County is recognized as one of the best counties in whi ch to live, work, and do business. MISSION To enrich the lives of Alameda County residents through visiona ry policies and accessible, responsible, and effective services. VALUES Integrity, honesty and respect fostering mutual trust. Transparency and accountability achieved through open communica tions and involvement of diverse community voices. Fiscal stewardship reflecting th e responsible management of res ources. Customer service built on commitment, accessibility and respons iveness. Excellence in performance based on strong leadership, teamwork and a willingness to take risks. Diversity recognizing the unique qualities of every individual and his or her perspective. Environmental stewardship to preserve, protect and restore our natural resources. Social responsibility promoting selfsufficiency, economic inde pendence and an interdependent system of care and support. Compassion ensuring all people are treated with respect, dignit y and fairness. STRATEGIC VISION The Alameda County Strategic Vis ion provides a multiyear, comp rehensive and farreaching roadmap for establishing Alameda County as one of the best counties in whic h to live, work and do business. The Strategic Vision consists of five areas, corresponding to the County's co re services and community priorities: Environment and Sustainability, Safe and Livable Communities, H ealthy and Thriving Populations, Housing, and Transportation. The Vision, Mission, Values and Strategic Vision are the founda tion for the County as the local arm of government that provides municipal services and other basic nee ds for the most vulner able populations. The Board of Supervisors adopts the County's annual budget and legi slative platform based on the aforementioned values that protect these populations which include infants, ch ildren, families, the elderly and disabled. The Board of Supervisors is alwa ys working to create a promisin g future for all. The County provides leadership through robust local initiatives such as the affordable housing bond approved by the voters in November of 2016. In its advocacy, the County illustrates the importance of the safety net services through the Human Impacts Budget and its personal success stories of the people w ho directly benefit from these services. In the last year, the Presidenti al Administration proposed seve re cuts to services that p rovide basic needs for vulnerable persons in Alameda Co unty. More than 1.6 million peo ple live in Alameda County, and approximately 12.5 percent of the population lives below the po verty threshold. One in seven children live below the poverty line. Two in three families living in poverty are working. The President's proposed budget would mean increased hunger, hom elessness, and threatens access to health care for struggling communities. Furthermore, other federal legislative and administrative propo sals advance a policy agenda that would decimate some county programs and the individual lives we serve . This legislative platform aims to create, support, and sustain the programs and services needed for our c ommunities to thrive. PAGE | 12 Alameda County Vision, Mission, Values and Legislative Principles 2018 Federal and State policy measures that undermine the County's a bility to execute our mission and achieve our strategic vision for healthy, thriving communities, social resp onsibility, environmental stewardship, protection of due process, civil rights and strength in diversity are stri kes against the fundamental guiding principles of our work.

PAGE | 16 Legislative Proposals PAGE | 17 Alameda County Legislative Proposals 2018 LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS Alameda County's 2018 legislative proposals, as outlined in the succeeding pages, are in keeping with the County's legislative principles. Alameda County advances legislation tha t will allow it to better serve its residents. HEALTH Proposal: Cannabis Reclassif ication to Facilitate Research Alameda County proposes to reclassify cannabis which is current ly listed on the federal Schedule 1 as a narcotic under the Controlled Substances Act. Cannabis should be reclass ified in order to facilitate research. Removal of cannabis from Schedule 1 will allow for researchers to easily c onduct research on its potential medical application without being hindered by stringent United States Drug Enforcem ent Administration (DE A) security demands. Discussion/Key Components Researchers face challenging obstacles to studying drugs on Sch edule 1. Cannabis can only be used under special government license for research. There are additional stringent criteria in the approval process by the DEA and the United States Food and Drug Administrati on (FDA) for trials . Researchers who want to conduct cannabis research must submit t o lengthy application pr ocesses that can last years, pass numerous review processes, and purchase the cannabi s from the National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA) to conduct the research. The research is limited by the THC potency level in NIDA cannabis which is lower than cannabis products used by patients. Furthermore, as a Sche dule 1 drug, it is more difficult to obtain federal research grants compared to substances on Schedules 2 and 3. Benefits Removal of cannabis from Schedule 1 will allow researchers to e asily conduct research on its potential medical application without being hindered by stringent DEA security de mands. The ultimate outcome for expanding research of cannabis is to analyze its medicinal properties so we further understand its health benefits and effects. HUMAN SERVICES Proposal: Breaking Barriers to Employment Amend the defined list of individuals with employment barriers, California Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, CA WIOA section 8(j) (114), by adding two more groups: ma rginally attached workers (including discouraged workers, and involuntary parttime workers\u2014numbers 14 and 15 on the list.) Discussion/Key Components Marginally attached workers are not in the labor force but want to work, are available for work, and have looked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months but are not counted a s unemployed because they had not searched for PAGE | 18 Alameda County Legislative Proposals 2018 work in the four weeks preceding the Current Population Survey. D i s c o u r a g e d w o r k e r s a r e a s u b s e t o f t h e marginally attached worker group and are similar, but they've s topped looking for work altogether because they believe there are no jobs available or there are none for which they would qualify. Involuntary parttime workers work less than 35 hours a week, often work several part time jobs to make ends meet, and desire full time work, but cannot find fulltime work. Overall, these worke rs are categorized within the labor underutilization rates captured by the Current Population Survey (CPS). In California, approximately 11.7 million people were not in th e labor force in Augus t 2017, an increase of 44,000 individuals from August 2016. Of those individuals in Au gust 2017, 64,000 were discouraged workers. Additionally, involuntary partt ime workers represented about 4 .5 percent of the employed as of August 2017. A significant amount of people. Marginally attached workers, especially the discouraged worker and involuntary parttime workers, are at risk to slip under the workforce system r adar without proper employment and educational interventions/opportunities. Benefits Resources can be better supplied to marginally attached and inv oluntary parttime workers, if they are recognized in the law, equipping them with training opportunities and othe r interventions to enable full labor participation. Proposal: Relative Placements: P rotecting the Future Care of Fo ster Youth Amend Welfare and Institution Code (WIC) Section 387 to change the \"more restrictive care\" categories and California Rules of Court (CRC) 5.560 to remove the step betwee n a relative home and foster home. This would eliminate the need for a WIC Section 387 petition to move a chi ld from a relative placement to a foster care placement, allowing counties to provide foster care funds to th e relative if the child is later placed back in the relative's home once the child's behaviors have stabilized. Discussion/Key Components Relatives are unfairly penalized by a denial of foster care fun ds for future placements in th eir care, after a child has been removed from their home and placed in a higher level of ca re even when the removal was solely due to the child's behavior and the relative caregiver's inability to main tain the child in their home. This limits the resources available to the relative for a child later placed in their car e, thereby hindering county efforts to place children in familybased settings. This proposal doesn't concern any remova l of a child from a relative when abuse or neglect by the relative caregiver has occurred. Despite the best efforts of a county welfare agency, service pr oviders, and a relative caregiver, sometimes it is necessary to move a child from a relative's home when a child's behavioral needs have become more than what can be met by the relative caregiver. In these situations, a ch ild may need to move, at least temporarily, to another placement. If there is another relative home that is be tter equipped to handle the child's behavioral needs, a county agency can move the child without the need to f ile a petition under (WIC ) Section 387. However, when another relative home is not available and a move to a hig her level of care is needed, current law requires the filing of a petition under W IC Section 387. This results in the relative's home being considered as the \"home of removal,\" which is problemati c because the relative is then ineligible for foster care payments for a future placement. This means that once a youth who was moved from a re lative has been stabilized in another placement with services and is ready to return to the relative' s care, this is often not possible because the relative will no longer have the financial support necessary to care for the youth. PAGE | 19 Alameda County Legislative Proposals 2018 Benefits There are many benefits to foster youth when they are placed wi th a relative in comparison to other placement settings. Relative placements have been found to lead to greate r placement and educational stability, fewer reentries to foster care for children who exit to reunification , reduced attempts by youth at leaving or running away from placement, a greater likelihood that the youth report that they \"always felt loved\", and reduced behavioral problems in the youth. Relative placements in genera l are more stable and can help alleviate the loss that children often feel when placed with caregivers whom they do not already know. Additionally, child welfare agencies have learned from experience that relative placements are helpful to youth when they transition through developmental stages, especially during the adolescent years. Amending WIC Section 387 to chang e the \"more restrictive care\" categories and California Rules of Court (CRC) 5.560 would strengthen existing law that already supports the p lacement of children with relatives; prevent children from losing the opport unity to live again with their r elatives and relatives from b eing punished by a loss of foster care funding, thereby decreasing the number of congregat e care placements; ensure resources are provided to relative caregivers to support the placement of foster youth in their care; and, provi de fairer treatment to relative caregivers under the Re source Family Approval (RFA) pr ocess. Proposal: Indigent Align sponsor deeming provisions with those used for C alFresh, such that determinations of indigence for sponsored noncitizens may be renewed for addition al 12month periods beyond the first indigence exception by adding a su bsection (c) to the Californ ia Welfare and Institutions (W & I) Code \u00a711008.135 to permit the annual re newal of indigence determinat ions for sponsored noncitizens receiving public benefits, given the consent of the sponsored noncitizen in question. Discussion/Key Components: The California W & I Code \u00a711008.135 serves as the State statut e governing exceptions to the standard eligibility and benefit determinations made by county welfare a gencies when sponsored noncitizens apply for public benefits. The statute requires that these determinations are subject to any exceptions as provided by federal law. It offers no further guidance or restrictions rega rding eligibility and benefit determination exceptions made for these individuals. Sponsor deeming involves a complex and lengthy income verificat ion process to determine a sponsored noncitizen's eligibility for, and amount of, an award for publi c benefits. When indigence determinations are made, they are valid for 12 months. In CalFresh, these determi nations are renewable annually without restriction. However, in CalWORK s, there is no such provision f or renewal. The indigenc e exception to sponsor deeming in CalWORKs may only be granted once in a noncitizen's lifetime. The misalignment of the State regulations for the administratio n of CalFresh and CalWORKs to the same vulnerable population, under the same conditions of financial s train, is a costly barrier to the efficient administration of benefit programs, and to clients' consistent, reliable access to public assistance. Benefits: This legislative change would provide necessary and timely assi stance to California's impoverished Legal Permanent Resident (LPR) families at a time of antiimmigration policies at the federal level; it would also simplify the administration of public benefits through the real ignment of CalWORKs sponsor deeming requirements to match those used by CalFresh. PAGE | 20 Alameda County Legislative Proposals 2018 Policy Overview PAGE | 21 Alameda County Policy Overview 2018 HUMAN SERVICES According to the 2016 U.S. Cens us Supplemental Poverty Measure, California continues to have the highest poverty rate in the country (20.4 percent or nearly eight million peopl e). The Supplemental Povert y Measure differs from the official poverty measure in that it accounts for difference s in the cost of living across the country. The high cost of housing in California contribut es to the high poverty rate. Fair Market Rent for a twobedroom apartment in Alameda County increased over $7,000 per year between 2015 and 2017. Wages have not kept pace with growing costs and families continue t o struggle to make ends meet. Most safetynet programs are currently under legislative and ad ministrative review, with an intent to limit access to provide federal budgetary relief. Alameda County holds the pers pective that this approach could lead to larger community costs in public health, economic resilience, and soci al wellbeing. A shift of cos t burden from the federal government to the states or localities would likely result in a reduction of available services. It could also lead to worsening outcomes for vulnerable populations and communities i n need. Localities would bear this burden. The federal government should preserve existing safetynet programs and funding streams, and enhance those that provide service to communities or populations in need. Safety net programs are often woven through decades of design; though some provide for similar populations or in similar ways, they rarely duplicate one another. Funding stream s and programs that have been targeted for elimination are generally not duplicative, but instead function through leveraging to enhance service availability. Federal funding levels are frequently inadequate to meet need, necessitating the layering of programs to provide a minimal level of sustenance and support. Alameda County encoura ges the review of safetynet programs in an effort to enhance community wel lbeing, but opposes efforts to r estrict access or reduce funding for necessary supportive services. During the recession, the State slashed funding for core health and human services programs (cutting over $15 billion between 2008 and 2013). There have been some restoratio ns over the past few years but too many core public services are underfunded following years of deep cuts. T he State and federal government should restore previously made cuts to safetynet programs, and make strategic enhancements to better serve individuals and families. Alameda County P overty and Hunger In 2016, 11.5 percent of Alameda County residents (approx. 189, 500 individuals) lived below the official poverty line. The Alameda County Community Food Bank estimates that one in three children in Alameda County face the threat of hunger every day, and one in five Alameda County resi dents turn to the Food Bank for assistance. SafetyNet Programs A recent California Poverty Meas ure report found that social sa fety net programs helped keep almost three million California residents out of deep poverty and moderated the impa ct of poverty, especially for children. Safety net benefits such as CalFresh (SNAP), CalWORKs (TANF), and the Earn ed Income Tax Credit (EITC) are critical resources to help meet basic needs. Cost of Living According to the SelfSufficien cy Standard, an adult with two c hildren in Alameda County would need to work 40 hours per week at $31.86 per hour ($66,450 annually) to cover b asic costs for housing, food, health care, transportation, child care, and taxes. This is equivalent to mo re than three fulltime jobs at the California minimum wage. For comparison, the feder al poverty level for a family o f three was $20,420 in 2017.

Research from the California Budget and Policy Center finds that on average, a single mother in Ala meda County would have to spend over 60 percent of her income to afford centerbased child care for two children. Access to quality early care and education is critical for children, especially those living in poverty. Research show s that a child's exposure to highquality preschool and early learning opportunities contributes to higher academic ach ievement, increased high school graduation rates, and greater readiness for college and careers. Aging Adults and Individuals with Disabilities Based on data from the California Department of Finance, the Al ameda County adult population aged 65 and above is projected to increase over 40 percent in the next 10 years. According to the California Elder Economic Security Index (a countyspecific measure of the minimum income necessar y to cover basic needs for retired older adults), about a half of seniors lack adequate resources to meet their b asic needs. In addition, according to 2015 Census data, 19.5 percent of individuals with disabilities in Alameda County live below the federal poverty line. During the recession, State funding for agi ng adults and individuals with disabilities was severely cut. Racial Wealth Gap The racial wealth gap in the U.S . is staggering. A 2016 study b y CFED (Corporation for Enterprise Development) and the Institute for Policy Studies found that if average Black fa mily wealth continues to grow at the same pace it has over the past three decades, it would take Black families 228 y ears to amass the same amount of wealth White families have today. For the average Latino family, it would ta ke 84 years. Without assets, families do not have a cushion in case of emergency, nor can they plan for the future by purchasing a home, sending their kids to college, or starting a business. In addition to the millions of families who live below the federal poverty line, Alameda County has a large number of families who are one illness, job loss, or other crisis away from poverty. Policies should promote savings and wealth building. PAGE | 23 Alameda County Policy Overview 2018 Need to Restore and Invest Alameda County supports public policies that strengthen the soc ial safety net for the most vulnerable while also investing in our future. Specifically, the County supports pol icies that provide highquality early care and learning experiences for children; help aging adults and those living wi th disabilities live healthier, more independent, and more engaged lives; educate and develop our workforce; make str ategic investments in places and neighborhoods with the highest need; encourage and support savings and wealth building; and promote the economic and social wellbeing of individuals, families, neighborhoods, and communi ties. The Human Services Chapters outline a policy agenda for advanci ng economic prosperity and equity so that all individuals, children, and families have the opportunity to suc ceed. HEALTH Health, disease and death are no t randomly distributed. Illness concentrates among lowincome people, people of color, and people with disabilities residing in certain geograp hical places. Inequities in economic, social, physical and service environments continue to create and maintain clear patt erns of poor health in Alameda County, statewide, and nationally. Despite increasing life expectancy for all racial groups, the g ap in life expectancy between Blacks and Whites in Alameda County persists. From 2013 to 2015, life expectancy at birth for African Americans/Blacks was 7 years less than for Whites. Compared to Asi an Americans, the group with th e highest life expectancy, African American/Black life expectancy at birth was 12 years less. Similar inequities exist when comparing neighborhoods in Alameda County with the highest poverty levels to those with the lowest poverty levels (see chart below). The geographic concentrations of race, poverty, disability, and poor health re flect a legacy of discrimination and segregation, as well as present day policies and prac tices that systemically perpetu ate unjust and unequal patterns. Due to constant pressures and lack of control over their environment, as well a s experiences of racism and discrimination, people living in these high poverty neighborhoods often face a chronic stress response, which over time actually wears down body systems and increases the risk of health conditions l ike hypertension or diabetes. In order to address the health inequities between different racial and ethnic groups an d other subpopulations, policies must be adopted that correct the social and environmental inequities underlinin g these health outcomes. A core mission of Alameda County's Health Care Services Age ncy is to eliminate these heal th and social inequities. PAGE | 24 Alameda County Policy Overview 2018 Females of all racial/ethnic groups live longer than their male counterparts, over four years on average. It has been demonstrated throughout this report that the average African Am erican life expectancy is foreshortened. However, when both gender and race/ethnici ty are taken into account, the gap widens to 17 years, with the average African American male living 71.1 years co mpared to the average Asian f emale who lives 88.0 years. The ten leading causes of death in Alameda County account for 7 4 percent of all deaths. Of these ten leading causes of death in Alameda County, over 90 percent were caused by chronic diseases including cancer, heart PAGE | 25 Alameda County Policy Overview 2018 disease, stroke, chronic lower respiratory disease, Alzheimer's , diabetes, hypertension, and liver disease. The table below outlines these ten leading causes of death. Although chronic diseases are among the most prevalent and cost ly health problems, they are also among the most preventable. Access to prevention and health care services affe ct chronic disease burden and outcome. To a large degree, the major chronic diseases-heart disease, cancer, strok e, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and diabetes\u2014result from our lifestyles and our habits of daily liv i n g . S o c i o e c o n o m i c s t a t u s i s a l s o a n i m p o r t a n t determinant of chronic disease risk. People who are poor, have lower levels of education, or are isolated are more likely to engage in a wide array of riskrelated behaviors. The social environment influences risk behaviors through the shaping of norms, patterns of social control, or environmen tal opportunities that determine individual behavior choices. Additionally, the social environment can impact people in ways that go beyond individual behavior choice. These can include factors which individuals may have little control over and can impact the health of entire communities, such as: exposure to environmental hazards, lack o f access to quality education, and lack of clean and affordable housing. Alameda Co unty supports policy solutions th at address each of these intervention points in order to prevent chronic disease s and reduce their inequitable burden across different racial and ethnic groups, as well as other subpopulations. When looking at the burden of chronic disease it's also importa nt to factor in the issues of mental illness. People with chronic medical conditions have a higher risk of depressio n and those with depressive disorders can lead to c h r o n i c i l l n e s s . T h e S u b s t a n c e A buse and Mental Health Services A d m i n i s t r a t i o n ( S A M H S A ) r e p o r t s t h a t t h e comorbidity of serious mental illness and chronic medical condi tions is particularly significant. People with serious mental illness and chronic illness die decades earlier than the general population mostly due to preventable health conditions such as diabetes, card iovascular, respiratory, or in fectious diseases (incl uding HIV). The stigma associated with mental illness of ten prevents those that are in the most need of treatment, for these preventable diseases, from accessing and utilizing primary care services, r esulting in increased morbidity and mortality. T h e l i f e c o u r s e p e r s p e c t i v e b r i n g s a c r i t i c a l a d d i t i o n a l l e n s t o this understanding of health, highlighting the importance of ensuring that babi es and children live in support ive community environments that will foster optimal health, development, and wellbeing over the course of their li ves. The life course perspective suggests that health disparities do not stem just from differential access to health care but are the result of broad social, economic, and environmental factors that affect one's experiences and opportu nities over a lifetime, with the greatest impact PAGE | 26 Alameda County Policy Overview 2018 occurring during critical periods of development, such as pregn ancy, early childhood, and adolescence. However, without the reversal of the cumulative disadvantages and inequi ties experienced over a lifetime or several lifetimes there will continue to be racial inequities in birth outcomes. Multilevel interventions are needed to address these disparities - both by providing needed services and by advancin g systemic change to address the root causes that have shaped the neighborhood conditions where poor health clust ers. On the other end of the life spectrum, Alameda County experienc ed a 55 percent increase in the age 60+ populations between 1980 and 2010. Current projections from the California Department of Finance predict that Alameda County will have a senior population of 581,756 by the year 2040. If this projection is accurate, Alameda County will have a 134 percent increase in the senior p opulation between 2010 and 2040, compared with the 55 percent increase experienced over the previous 30 years. Disability increases with age as onethird of adults 65 years of age and above in Alameda County live with at least one disability. In Alameda County persons with disabilities are economically at risk: one in five individuals with disabilities live in poverty, and one in two individuals with disabilities cannot ma ke ends meet. Multiple factors exist that contribute to this economic disparity: only one in four individuals with d isabilities graduate from hi gh school; three in five adults with disabilities are not in the labor force, and nearly a quarter of adults with disabilities spend more than half their income on housing. In 2015, the U.S. Census Bureau e stimates there were 161,363 persons with a disability representing nearly 10 percent of the Alameda County population. African Americans have the highest percentage of persons with a disability in Alameda County (17.6 percent) followed by American Indian/Alaskan Natives (17.3 percent) and White s (10.6 percent). There are sta tistically significant differences in health care utilization and chronic health conditions between individuals w ith and without disabilities. Individuals with disabilities in Alameda County received medical care in emergen cy departments and delayed seeing a physician and obtaining prescription medication at twice the rate of those wi thout disabilities. In addition, in Alameda County, individuals with disabilities are diagnosed with high blood pre ssure at nearly three time s the rate of individuals without disabilities; the prevalence of heart disease is six ti mes greater in individuals with disabilities than those without disabilities, and the rate of diabetes is over twice as high in individuals with disabilities compared to those without disabilities. Finally, individuals with disabilit i e s e x p e r i e n c e s e r i o u s m e n t a l h e a l t h i s s u e s a t o v e r three times the rate of those wi thout disabilities. Improved ac cess to prevention and healthcare services, increased data for decision making, and explicit inclusion in public heal th programs are paramount to addressing these health care disparities. Implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) provides a hist oric opportunity to provide access to preventative health services to previously underserved populations. Californ ia and Alameda County have led the country in aggressively implementing the ACA. As a result, Alameda County' s uninsured rate dropped from 13.3 percent in 2010 to 4.2 percent in 2016. How ever, many challenges still lie ahead to ensure that all those who can benefit from the new law are able to do so. This includes a need to exp and the number of primary care providers and to increase the MediCal reimburseme nt rate to ensure access to ca re for all MediCal beneficiaries. Additionally, certain Alameda County residents, such as undocumented immigran ts, do not benefit from the new law. Continued legislative action will be needed to ensure that no one falls t hrough the cracks of o ur healthcare system. Additional challenges remain due to budget cuts at both the sta te and federal levels that have occurred over the last several years. These cuts disproportionately impacted our most vulnerable populations including people with disabilities, seniors, and lowincome children and adults. Some efforts have been made to reinstate these cuts, but additional funding and reinvestm ent of lost services is necessa ry to preserve the safety net system of care. Alameda County supports policies that allow everyone, no matter who they are, where they live, how much money they make, their ability, or the color of their skin, to have a ccess to the same opportunities to lead a healthy, fulfilling and productive life. PAGE | 27 Alameda County Policy Overview 2018 ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH The Mission of Alameda County's Environmental Health department is to protect the health, safety and wellbeing of residents in the county throug h promotion of environmental q uality and food safety. This is accomplished through the following regulator y and direct service programs: Food Safety: The department enforces the Cali fornia Retail Food code (Calcod e) via a vigorous inspection program for retail food establishments which include; restaurants, mark ets, bakeries, liquor stores, bars, certified farmers' market, food service at fairs and festivals, catering trucks, h ot dog carts, ice cream trucks, produce vehicles, and food vending machines. The food safety program also conducts mu ltilingual food safety classes, conducts plan reviews for new and remodeled facilities, and issues permits, i nvestigates complaints and suspected food borne illnesses, and carriesout food recalls. The public is kept inf ormed via a restaurant grading system that requires food facilities including mobile food trucks to display color coded placards issued by the department attesting to a facilities compliance with food safety laws. Hazardous Materials, Leaking Underground Storage Tank (LUFT) Sp ills, Leaks Investigation and Cleanup (SLIC) Local Oversight Programs: Through Memoranda of Understanding with the State of California Department of Toxics Substances Control (DTSC)and the Regional Water Quality Control board, is a Certified Unified Program Agency ( C U P A ) w h i c h e n f o r c e s s t a t e l a w w i t h r e s p e c t t o t h e H a z a r d o u s m aterials management plan program(HMMP/HMBP), underground storage tank program, tiered pe rmitting program, local oversight SLIC/LUFT program and risk management program in the cities of Alameda, A lbany, Castro Valley, Dublin, Emeryville, Oakland, Piedmont, Newark, San Lorenzo, Sunol, and the unincorporated ar eas of Fremont, Hayward, Livermore, Pleasanton, San Leandro and parts of Byron, Mountain House and Tracy. Solid, Medical Waste & Body Art Programs: The Department's Solid Waste Program is the Local Enforcement Agency (LEA) for the California Department of Resources Recycli ng and Recovery (CalRecycle) and is responsible for enforcing state minimum standards, permits, and related state s olid waste laws and regulations at transfer stations, compostable material handling facilities and operations, constr uction and demolition facilities, solid waste vehicles and landfills. The Department is also the LEA for the Californi a Department of Public Health (CDPH), responsible for the enforcement of the Medical Waste Management Act (MWMA) unde r the Medical Waste Program. This program regulates generators of medical waste facilities such as hospit als, skilled nursing facilities, and doctor, dentist and veterinarian offices. The Department is also responsible in enf orcing health and safety standards for body art establishments and body art prac titioners under the Body Art Pr ogram. L a n d U s e ( S e p t i c ) : T h e L a n d U s e P r o g r a m a d m i n i s t e r s a l o c a l w a s t e w a t e r m a n a g e m e n t program for onsite wastewater treatment systems (OWTS) or septic systems in both u nincorporated and incorporated areas of the County under the authority of Chapter 15.18 of the Alameda Coun ty General Ordinance Code. OWTS are useful and necessary structures that allow habitation at locations that ar e removed from centraliz ed wastewater treatment systems. Vector Control and Household Hazardous Waste Service Programs: The Vector Control program's mission is to prevent and minimize the spread of vectorborne diseases, injur y and discomfort to the residents of Alameda County. The program provides assistance to residents and the co mmunity as a whole by monitoring and controlling rodent and other disease vectors, assisting residents in mitiga ting vector infestations on th eir property, surveillance of vector borne diseases such as West Nile fever and Lyme disea se. The Department operates the Household Hazardous Waste program u nder a MOU with the Alameda County Waste Management Authority, (ACWMA) th e Joint Powers Authority (JPA) charged with proper handling for home generated hazardous and medical waste. The program has 4 facili ties that accept hazardous waste from the public and small businesses pursuant to s tate and federal regulations. PAGE | 28 Alameda County Policy Overview 2018 EDUCATION The guarantee of high quality a ccessible educational opportunit ies for all County residents across the life course are essential to our shared health and prosperity and advances the County's vision to be recognized as one of the best counties in which to live, work an d do business. Educational pe rformance and attainment gaps stem from a differential access to highquality educational opportunities w hich are rooted in historical national patterns of underfunding early childhood progr ams and schools serving lowi ncome youth and youth of color. A student's path toward high school graduation and future econo mic security is set even before a child starts school, and therefore support for academic success must begin during th e critical prenatal and early childhood periods. Early childhood education and programs are vital building block s for students from birth to eight years and are important to educational attainment, achievement and health out comes for all children, particularly boys of color. Research shows that positive education results are strongly cor related with access to early childhood programs; Pre Kindergarten (PreK) education, especially for lowincome child ren of color, effectively decreases future special education placement, improves grade retention, and increases hi gh school graduation and college attendance. However, nationally, publicly funded PreK or Head Start progra ms are underfunded and do not meet enrollment needs. In the County, thousands of children who qualify for fin ancial assistance remain on waiting lists due to lack of federal, state or other f unding to support subsidies. In California, African American and Latino students are signifi cantly more likely than Whites and Asians to attend schools facing critical resource challenges, which include lack of ability to offer competitive salaries to attract experienced teachers and discourage teacher turnover; shortages of educational materials; rundown facilities; fewer resources for English language l earners, students with disabili ties and undocumented students, and a lack of parent engagement programs. From a very early age, many low income youth and youth of color in the County are exposed to trauma and violence at home and in their communities. This exposure to Adverse Chil dhood Experiences (ACEs) con tributes significantly to Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, anxiety and depressive disor ders, chronic health conditions, and in barriers to learning. A safe and healthy environment that protects the comm unity from stress, violence and poverty from the prenatal period and onward is e ssential for academic success. T his is particularly true for boys of color, who from early childhood, experience some of the most significant dispar ities in health and education outcomes. Additionally, policies and programs that support student health outcomes can positively impact educational attainment. There is a strong n eed to improve the identificatio n of students with disabilities and to provide supports for these students who, in Calif ornia, continue to rank among t he lowes t in the nation in math and reading assessments. It is equally as impo rtant to provide meaningful, appropriate training and educational opportunities f o r s t u d e n t s w i t h d i s a b i l i t i e s , w h o a r e r e a c h i n g t h e a g e o f m a t urity without developing the skills needed for academic success or future economic sustainability. High povert y neighborhoods have higher rates of students chronically absent from school (missing 10 percent or more scho ol days) compared to a ffluent neighborhoods, negatively influencing outcomes in academic performance and gra duation. Student absenteeism also impacts school district income from the State which is based on attendance, an d further erodes the school's ability to meet the educational and social needs of students. IMMIGRATION Alameda is the most diverse county in the Bay Area and the four th most diverse county in t he United States, and is home to over half a million immigrants who live, work, attend s chool, vote, and engage in everyday activities in our communities. Nearly 1 in 3 Alameda County residents (32 percent ) i s a n i m m i g r a n t . T h i s r e p r e s e n t s a t l e a s t 526,148 naturalized U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, temporary migrants, humanitarian migrants, and other foreignborn residents who were not U.S. citizens at birt h. PAGE | 29 Alameda County Policy Overview 2018 Immigrants are a vital and integral part of the social fabric o f Alameda County and throughout our state and nation. More than 60 percent of immigrants in Alameda County have been living in the U.S. for 17 or more years. As longtime residents, immigrants ( and many of their U.S. born chi ldren) have developed extensive ties within schools and workplaces and made positive contributions to the l arger community. Immigrants make up almost half of people living in Union City (46 percent of the populati on) and Fremont (45 percent) and more than onethird of people living in Hayward (39 percent), San Leandro (35 perce nt), Ashland (35 percent), Cherryland (35 percent), Newark (34 percent), and San Lorenzo (33 percent). Driven by a complex array of factors including globalization, g lobal economic inequality, foreign policies, and conditions in home countries such as poverty and oppression, im migrants come to Alameda County from all over the world (largely Asia followed by Latin America). Most seek a better life for themselves and/or families, including increased safety, freedom, and opportunity. In recent years, in creased violence and other pressures in Central America has led to an unprecedented increase in the number of u naccompanied immigrant youth (UIY) coming to the U.S. without a parent or guardian. Alameda County is home t o the second highest number of UIY released to sponsors in California (aft er Los Angeles County). Immigrants contribute substantially to the local, state, and na tional economy as workers, job creators, tax payers, homeowners, and consumers. In Ca lifornia, immigrants comprise 3 5 percent of the state workforce, over 33 percent of business owners, and pay over $3 billion in annual s tate and local taxes. In Alameda County, close to 2 out of 5 workers (38 percent) in the civilian labor force are immig rants. In addition, more than 1 in 3 homeowners (35 percent) is an immigrant. Immigration has an overall positi ve impact on longterm economi c growth in this country . Immigrants typically contribute more through income, payroll, and other taxes to sup port public programs like Medicare and Social Security than they receive in government benefits, even though many of the immigrants who contribute to these programs will never have an o pportunity to benefit from them. While immigrants have relatively high employment rates, they ar e more likely to work in lowwage jobs, less likely to have health insurance from employers, and more likely to fac e barriers to accessing health and human service programs. Immigrants also often face extreme social vulnerabili ty resulting from linguistic isolation, challenging processes of acculturation in the face of discrimination, and t he inability to access basic needs such as housing and medical care. Together, these factors present multiple and cumu lative risks to the physical and mental health of immigrants and their often mixedstatus families, which, in tur n, have farreaching implications for the broader community. According to the United Nation's International Organization for Migration, there has been a 17 percent increase in migrant deaths at the USMexic o border in 2017 even though fewe r people have been migrating to the U.S. from Mexico overall. Since U.S. policies around immigration do not m itigate factors that drive people to leave their home countries, such as the threat of gang violence, crime and lack of economic opportunity, more strict immigration policies often force people to take more dangerous routes to cross the U.S.Mexico border. There has also been a reported increase in U.S. immigration officials ill egally turning away asylum seekers at the border, which could lead women and children in particular to attempt da ngerous border crossings i nstead of seeking asylum. California and the nation are weakened by policies that are res trictive towards and isolate or exclude immigrants from the broader community. Antiimmigrant policies and practic es also jeopardize the health of immigrants and the broader community by contributing to fear and stress, famil y separation, and reluctance to report crimes. Fear of immigration enforcement also increases immigrants' vulnerabi lity to crime and violence and decreases public safety overall. Additionally, barriers to health care access fo r immigrant populations leads to decreased health care utilization and results in sicker people, as well as serious st rains on emergency care systems. PAGE | 30 Alameda County Policy Overview 2018 JOBS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT Alameda County has emerged from the recession with a steady rec overy; the unemploymen t rate in August 2017 was down to 4.4 percent. However, the positive effects of the economic recovery are not being felt by all workers. Unemployment rates remain higher for African Americans, Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders, American Indians, and Latinos (16.5 percent, 13.9 percent, 12.3 percent and 8.9 p ercent, respectively countywide according to the American Community Survey). Many of the new jobs created during the recovery are lowwage j obs that offer little or no opportunity for advancement. Additionally, women, and especially women of color , are more likely to have lowpaying jobs. A large share of a lowincome worker's earnings goes to paying rent, wh ich makes it difficult to get ahead. The living wage in Alameda County for one adul t and one child in 2017 is $31.68 per hour, according to the Living Wage Calculator developed by Dr. Amy Glasmeier at the Massachusetts Institute o f Technology (MIT). As of January 2017, California's minimum wage is $10. 50 per hour for employers with more than 26 employees and $10.00 per hour for employers with 25 or less employees, translating into approxima tely three times less the amount required to make it in in Alameda County as a sin gle parent with one child. A wo rker in Alameda County would need the equivalent of four fulltime jobs at minimum wage to afford a twobedroom apa rtment. Stagnant wages combined with rising local rents are contributing to the mass displacement of commun ities that once were firmly rooted in Alameda County. Poverty and unemployment continue to disproportionately impact people of color across our County. According to a 2014 data report by Alameda County Public Health Department, in Alameda County, 1 in 15 White residents live in highpoverty neighborhoods compared to one in nine Asians, one in four Latinos, and one i n three Black residents. Deeply concentrated and persistent poverty has been exacerbated by State and federal policies that destabilized entire families and neighborhoods. In the face of longstanding dis investment, residents in high p overty neighborhoods face limited job availability, transportation barriers, few child care options, and a lack of quality education and training opportunities. There is a lack of resources and opportuniti es for stable employment that offers a living wage and benefits. Fewer economic resources often mean tradeoffs between paying fo r food, housing, or healthcare. All of these economic factors at the individua l and community level contribu te to a clear social gradient in health and well b e i n g . O n a v e r a g e , t h e r e i s a s e v e n y e a r d i f f e r e n c e i n l i f e e x p ectancy between the most and least affluent neighborhoods in the County. This gap is even starker in some c ities; it rises to 15 years when comparing the historically disinvested neighbo rhood of West Oakland to the af fluent Oakland Hills. Access to an educated, skilled, and healthy workforce is critic al to the economic vitality of our local communities, State, and country. Persistent inequity puts us at a competitiv e disadvantage. Investment is needed in education, job creation, economic development, workforce programs, youth e mployment opportunities, and programs that help alleviate barriers to work. A l a m e d a C o u n t y s u p p o r t s S t a t e a n d f e d e r a l p o l i c i e s t h a t m a k e s t rategic investments to bolster community economic development and help create shared prosperity and coll ective wellbeing. The Jobs and Economic Development Chapters detail a State and federal policy agenda f or advancing economic equity in Alameda County. PLANNING LAND USE AND HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT The County proposes policies that foster the health and wellbe ing of all individuals and communities by supporting and developing a built environment that promotes economic and o ther opportunities for residents, contributes to health, and encourages modes of transportation that reduce gree nhouse gases (GHG). The \"built environment\" refers to the human made surroundings that provide the setting for human activity, such as roads, buildings, sidewalks, farms, or parks. Such legislation would seek to redu ce the use of car trips, prevent displacement, reduce pollution, reduce greenhouse gases, improve access to public tr ansportation, improve safety, increase the supply of PAGE | 31 Alameda County Policy Overview 2018 affordable housing, make communi ties walkable and bikeable, and increase access to parks, green space, grocery stores, community/school gardens a nd farmers' markets. These ef forts improve housing conditions, supply, and affordability, which add to the economic vitality of households and make communities safer and more vibrant, and strengthen community interaction. Affordable housing has a positive community impact enhancing ho using stability, employment, mental and physical health, and school attendance. Aff ordable housing also reduces active substance use, criminal justice recidivism, and other negative community impacts . Many communities in Californi a are exploring and developing community choice energy programs, termed Community Choice Aggregation, community based energy programs or public utility. As an alternative to Investor Owned Utilities (IOUs), community ch oice programs can be more effective in creating green/renewable energy with more local economic development imp act. Legislation should not be supported that limits the ability of local governments to create energy procur ement programs. Roadblocks should not be put in place to benefit the status quo, and new laws should promote th e creation of more renewable energy, limit use of fossil fuels, and allow for more energy efficiency programs. PUBLIC SAFETY The State of California is decreasing the number of individuals in state prison, thereby increasing pressure on County Public Safety Departments and stretching thin our available res ources. Historically, Alameda County has retained individuals locally who have been convicted of low level feloni es such as nonsexual, nonviolent, and nonserious crimes. The County supports efforts in the area of rehabilitati on and programs providing options for incarcerated and/or formerly incarcerated individuals to make safer, healthi er and crime freechoices. The County also supports collaborative efforts among gover nment entities, communitybase d organizations, nonprofit entities, and private entities to provide services to reduce the rate of recidivism. Alameda County including the Dis trict Attorney's Office, the Pu blic Defender's Office, the Sheriff's Office and the Probation Department, have a lon g standing commitment to rehabi litation of residents who have had criminal offenses. Statewide efforts, such as Proposition 47 and AB 109, both of which recognizes the full humanity and potential of individuals, an d provides an opportunity for s econd chances. Immigration Immigrants are valuable and essential members of the California community. Almost one in three Californians are foreign born and one in two children in California has at least one immigrant parent. A relationship of trust between California's immigrant community and state and local agencies i s central to the public safety of people in Alameda County. This trust is threatened when state and local agencies are entangled with federal immigration enforcement, with the result that immigrant community members fear approachi ng police when they are victims of, and witnesses to, crimes, seeking basic health and social services, or attending school, to the detriment of public safety and the wellbeing of Ala meda County residents. The District Attorney's Office assists victims, irrespective of their legal status in the United States, in obtaining U Visas and TVisas. This enables victims, of domestic violence a nd human trafficking, to stay in the country and receive benefits. Health Care and Other Services Improve Outcomes In keeping with the progressive nature of Alameda County, publi c safety agencies have formed stronger working relationships with Social Services, Health Care, and the Commun ity Development Agency (particularly in the area of housing) with the aim of helping to reduce poverty and recidivi sm. Alameda County supports legislation that expands health insurance coverage for individuals who are at ri sk for incarceration and those who have been incarcerated. As part of MediCal expansion through the Afforda ble Care Act, over one million Californians became newly eligible for MediCal in 2014 and this expansion means th at more previously incarcerated individuals are now eligible for MediCal. This is significant, as more than half o f all prison and jail inmates (including 56 percent of state prisoners, 45 percent of federal prisoners and 64 percent of lo cal jail inmates) were found to have mental health problems, according to a study published by the Justice Departm ent's Bureau of Justice St atistics. The MediCal expansion makes prevention and early intervention for treatment of mental health problems and substance use PAGE | 32 Alameda County Policy Overview 2018 more accessible. By being able to access medical treatment for these issues, it directly addresses a major factor that leads to incarceration thereby helping to reduce recidivism. By extension, it is anticipated that this could help Alameda County reduce the number of people cycling through the criminal justice system and also contribute to reducing racial disparities in incarceration frequently correla ted with disparate access to treatment. Alameda County supports legislation to assist more people i n accessing health coverage and the other public benefits for which they are elig ible. The County supports and a pplauds the repeal of the lifetime drug felony ban for CalWORKs and CalFresh. Beginnin g in April 2015, individuals wit h a prior drug felony will now be able to access these critical public benefits to help them stabilize. In addit ion to cash and nutrition assistance, CalWORKs and CalFresh both offer employment a nd training support. Restoring access to these benefits will improve outcomes for very vulnerable families and, in turn, could reduce the risks f or reoffending. Mental Health Despite never being designed for the treatment or housing of th ose with mental health needs, jails have become the de facto mental health facilities in many communities across th e country. Untreated mental health conditions frequently result in chronic homelessness and an inability to f ind stable employment or housing, increasing the likelihood that those suffering from mental illness come into c ontact with law enforcement. Courts and law enforcement, are sometimes the first points of contact with the mentally ill, and can serve a useful function in identifying people with mental disorders and connecting them to existing services, thereby reducing recidivism. Alameda County believes in helping those with mental illness re ceive treatment. Specifically, Alameda County supports the further expansion of Assisted Outpatient Treatment ( A O T ) P r o g r a m a n d f u r t h e r e x p a n d i n g i t s Behavioral Health Court to rec eive wrap around treatment. Realignment Alameda County supports legislation that provides more funds fo r realignment. Realignment is a State initiative that protects the public from being victimized by crime by providing strong opportunities for individuals who have committed crimes to access resources such as education, employm ent training and placement, substance abuse counseling and mental health services. This aims to reduce crim inal behavior and recidivism by channeling lower level offenders to community corrections programs strengthened through communitybased punishment, improved supervision strategies, and evidencebased practices and superv ision practices demonstrat ed by research to reduce recidivism. It also includes empl oying proven alternatives to i ncarceration for lowrisk offenders. Alameda County's realignment plan is managed by the Community C orrections Partnership Executive Committee (CCPEC). The committee is chaired by the Probation Chief, and i ncludes the Sheriff, Dis trict Attorney, Public Defender, a local Police Chief, Social Services Agency Director , and a representative fro m the Superior Court. The committee provides planning, oversight, implementation, and ass essment of realignment in the County. Realignment objectives and goals are accomplished through the e xpanded use of evidencebased practices and programming that will promote positive behavioral change and ou tcomes. Individuals in Alameda County convicted of crimes eligible unde r realignment may receive a term of felony probation, though crimes more serious in nature may see defenda nts sentenced to local prison. Individuals on probation are supervised by the Alameda County Probation Depart ment, and those sentenced to local prison will continue to serve their prison sentence in Santa Rita county ja il under the jurisdiction of the Alameda County Sheriff's Office, and not in state prison under the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. Most inmates released from state prison are supervised by Alameda County Pro bation under Post Release Community Supervision. District Attorney The District Attorney is the only entity that has the constitut ional and statutory authority to file criminal charges against an individual. The filing decision is at the discretion of the District Attorney and each case is evaluated at all stages. The District Attorney continues to work with the defens e bar, including the Public Defender, to implement PAGE | 33 Alameda County Policy Overview 2018 programs that provide alternatives to incarceration. The Distri ct Attorney has created the Early Intervention Court (EIC) for realignmenteligible individuals charged with lowlev el felony crimes. The EIC refers individuals to programs after they are out of custody. The District Attorney also colla borates with pretrial release organizations to divert eligible individuals charged with misdemeanors from being forma lly charged and/or having their cases dismissed after successful completion of a program. The District Attorney will continue to effectivel y negotiate with the Public Defender and defense attorneys to identify alternatives to inca rceration through formal felony probation. The District Attorney's office has documented that the use of felon y probation has been effective, with an average recidivism rate of 27 percent. T he District Attorney and Public Defender continue to meet and navigate processes and protocols to provi de early termination of formal probation and Clean Slate programs that will allow convictions to be set aside under appropriate circumstances. When an individual on felony probation, Post Release Community Supervision, or Parole is alleged to have committed a new offense, the District Attorney has the option o f filing new charges and a violation, or solely filing a revocation petition. The District Attorney has similar power to revoke Post Release Community Supervision and Mandatory Supervision. The Distri ct Attorney's Office staffs th e courts that handle these revocation proceedings. Alameda County Family J ustice Center (ACFJC) For over 12 years, the Alameda County Family Justice Center has served victims of crime in Alameda County. Created by the District Attorney's Office, the ACFJC serves vic tims of domestic violence and their children, victims of sexual assault, elder abuse, and human trafficking. Since the i nception of the ACFJC, more than 115,000 people have been served. The ACFJC, under the leadership of the District At torney's Office, has introduced several initiatives including: STEPUP (Survivor Training Empow erment Program Utilizing your Potential): A women's empowerment and independence program for victims of domestic violence and s exual assault. STEPUP also serves as a diversion program for women charged with public assistance frau d. Natalie's Nook: A 123 Read program for children who have witnessed interperso nal violence. The program also provides counseling and childyouth engagement services. Youth The District Attorney's Office is committed to utilizing altern ative methods to serve youth in the Juvenile Justice System. As an alternative to pursuing criminal charges, the Dis trict Attorney's Office par tners with the nonprofit Community Works in comprehensive restorative justice programs. T h e D i s t r i c t A t t o r n e y ' s O f f i c e h a s a r o b u s t Truancy Mediation Program that includes the Truancy Family Cour t Program. Additionally, th e Office participates in Girls Court and the Mental Health Court for Youth. We recognize the need for genderspecific restorative justice programs to best serve the needs of the participating youth. Tw o of these programs ar e 'My Life, My Choice' (providing alternatives to detention that specifically link you ng men to mentors and career paths) and the Young Women's Saturday Program (an educational and counseling program for young women who have been commercially sexually exploited, o r are at risk for being explo ited). Alameda County supports more programs and opportunities for you th. Law enforcement entities within the county have already created opportunities for youth to help foster a p ositive view of law enforcement and provide them with valuable work experience. For example, the Alameda County District Attorney's Office has a program for youth c a l l e d t h e D i s t r i c t A t t o r n e y ' s J u s t i c e A c a d e m y ( D A J A ) . T h i s p r o g r a m p r o v i d e s y o u t h ( a g e d 1 6 t o 1 8 ) w i t h t h e opportunity to learn about the justice system by participating in educational seminars and paid internships. DAJA Students are placed in a paid internship in a legal or governme nt office to gain work experience and different skills required in the professional workforce. Violence Prevention Alameda County supports budgetary and legislative actions that address the root causes of all forms of violence, improve public safety, shift resources from incarceration to pr evention, and benefit comm unities disproportionately affected by violence (includi ng lowincome communities, c ommunities of color, and people with disabilities). PAGE | 34 Alameda County Policy Overview 2018 Alameda County is committed to pur suing solutions that recogniz e the impact of mental health, drug use, and poverty on those involved in, or at risk of involvement in, the criminal justice system. Alameda County opposes legislation that focuses on suppr ession strategies that do not ameliorate root causes and ri sk factors, unless they are balanced by primary prevention support. Alameda County defines violence as intimate partner violence, f amily violence, gun violence, gang violence, suicide, homicide, commercial sexual exploitation of minors, youth viole nce, hate violence, sexual a ssault, as well as child and elder abuse. Alameda County defines public safety as effort s that promote crime prevention and reduction, collaborative and positive communitylaw enforcement relationsh ips, nonviolent conflict resolution, restorative justice, successful reintegratio n of people with criminal convi ctions into communities, living wage jobs, educational opportunities, affordable housing , and the protection of all co mmunity members' civil rights. In 2005, Alameda County adopted a Violence Prevention Blueprint that identifies and elevates prevention strategies that address the root causes and risk factors for violence, cri tical for improving public s afety. In 2009 the Violence Prevention Initiative (VPI), established to implement the Blueprint strategies, focused on bu ilding assets, resiliency among youth, families and those reentering the community from i ncarceration, as well as ensuring capacity building with community partners. While p revention strategies are expens ive in the shortterm, we expect longterm savings from the investment in our community. Ultimately, investing sta te and federal resources in preventing and breaking the cycle of violence will save our county and community money. Violence is an issue that impacts all parts of our community, b ut it disproportionately affects lowincome communities, communities of color and people with disabilities. As a result, resources and legislation for preventing violence and protecting public sa fety should prioritize these s pecific communities. SUSTAINABILITY, CLIMA TE CHANGE, AND ENERGY Alameda County has been at the forefront of the environmental p rotection movement for decades, consistently supporting legislation to preserv e our nation's natural resourc es and protect public health. We know that legislative actions that prioritize the pres ervation and restoration of our environment help ensure the longterm health, social wellbeing, and economic vitality of the communities we serve w hile improving the quality of life for all. In 2018, our federal legislative e fforts will focus on protecti ng the legislation, regu latory structures, and implementing authority of the agencies that have advanced envir onmental and community health for the last 40 years. At the State level, we will support legislation that adv ances aggressive actions to both fight and plan for climate change while building resilient communities. Our legisl ative efforts at all levels will work towards securing adequate resources to fulfill our Board's commitment to creatin g a sustainable Alameda County. To this end, we will advocate fo r improved energy, water, and r esource efficiency; clean energy; pollution control and toxics reduction; and climate protection. We will support h ousing, transportation, landuse, and community development policies and projects that create diverse neighborh oods, promote healthy and greener lifestyles, and protect local and global ecosystems. We will support policies t hat bring environmental justice to all, keep our citizens safe from the physical, economic, and the health effec ts of environmental degradation, while creating pathways to economic prosperit y and strong loc al economies. TRANSPORTATION Alameda County is responsible for the planning, implementation, and maintenance of transportation infrastructure in unincorporated areas, including the design, construction and ongoing maintenance of local streets and roads, pedestrian and bicycle facilities, and traffic control faciliti es. The County strives to provide, maintain, and preserve public infrastructure in an efficient and effective manner whil e promoting a healthy and sustainable environment that supports safe and l ivable communities. PAGE | 35 Alameda County Policy Overview 2018 Adequate funding is critical to both the ongoing maintenance of and improvements to the transportation infrastructure to provide safe and convenient travel along and across streets for all users, including motorists, emergency vehicles, pedestrians, bicyclists, public transit, fr eight and commercial goods movement. In April 2017, the legislature and Governor enacted the Road Re pair and Accountability Act of 2017 (SB 1) a longsought robust, multimodal a nd comprehensive transportatio n funding package. Once fully implemented, California counties will share approximately $750 million annua l l y f o r l o c a l s t r e e t s a n d r o a d s m a i n t e n a n c e , rehabilitation. SB 1 also provides opportunities to compete for grants in the active transportation, planning, and congestion relief programs. While this is good news for the imm ediate future, with the shift from fossil fuel vehicles to clean energy, it will be necessary to identify an ongoing, s ustainable revenue source that isn't reliant on fossil fuel consumption. Ensuring the longterm financial integrity of the Highway Trust Fund (HTF) remains a high priority for Alameda County. While recent laws authori zing the federal surface trans portation programs have greatly improved the effectiveness and efficiency of these programs, Congress has re lied on general fund transfers and other offsets from federal resources unrelated to th e surface transportation progr ams since 2008. It is imperative that Congress pass a surface transportation program bill which addresses issues with the HTF prior to the expiration of the FAST Act in 2020. Alameda County also supports legislative priorities set forth b y the California State Association of Counties (CSAC), County Engineer's Association of California (CEAC), the Metropo litan Transportation Commission (MTC), the Alameda County Transportation Commission (ACTC), National Assoc iation of Counties and the American Public Works Association. FLOOD CONTROL AND WATER RESOURCES Much of Alameda County is in a flood plain. Prior to the 1950s, large portions of the county flooded repeatedly resulting in closed businesses and schools, interrupted transpo rtation and utility services, and even took lives. In 1949, the State Legislature creat ed Alameda County Flood Contro l and Water Conservation D istrict (the \"District\"). The District designed and constr ucted flood control infrastruct ure assuming full buildout of the county. Cities and unincorporated areas, grouped by \" zones\" corresponding to area watersheds and community boundaries, joined the District to gain protect ion from devastating floods. The District's flood control infrastructure \u2014 a system of pump stations, erosion control structures, dams, and hundreds of miles of pipeline, channels, levees, and creeks \u2014 p rotects nine zones in western Alameda County stretching from Emeryville to Fremont. Work continues to upgrad e or replace aging equipment, keep flood control channels clear of silt and debri s, and evaluate impacts of new developments on our creeks and channels. To ensure continued protection from flooding and to protect its natural resources, Al ameda County supports legislative remedies aimed at increasing funding for restoratio n projects, and developing adaptive strategies to climate change and sea level rise. Furthermore, regulatory inef ficiencies continue to hamper the effective and timely delivery of flood control projects. Delivery of projects is often bogged down by the multiple and mostly redundant approval processes and long timeframes, including env ironmental clearance and mitigation, design approval, right of way certification, and project financing. To this end, Alameda County seeks legislative remedies to streamline regulatory burdens w hile advocating for funding supp ort to adequately staff at the local, State, and federal regulatory agencies. PAGE | 36 Alameda County Policy Overview 2018 This page intentionally left blank PAGE | 37 State Legislative Priorities PAGE | 38 Alameda County State Legislative Priorities 2018 HUMAN SERVICES CREATE A HUMAN SERVICES SYSTEM T HAT IS RESPONSIVE TO COMMUNITY NEEDS Lowincome individuals and families need restoration of critica l benefits, increased flexibility, expansion of programs that work, services that are linguistically and cultur ally accessible, and the simplification/streamlining of processes and systems to ensure they are able to access all the benefits for which they are eligible. Alameda County supports public policies that preserve and strengthen th e social safety net for the most vulnerable while also advancing economic prosperity and equity so that all indiv iduals, children, and families have the opportunity to succeed. Better Facilitate Access to Benefits Streamline and integrate public assistance benefits enrollment. Support policies and systems that make it easier for individuals and families to have access to, apply fo r, utilize, retain, and recertify for benefits, including CalWORKs, CalFresh, General Assi stance, MediCal, and supportiv e services, including housing and childcare. Maintain continuity of benefits. Enact policies that help individuals and families maintain cove rage and benefits. Specifically, support automatic renewals for families living on a fixed income or households who are highly unlikely to experience changes in income that could term inate eligibility. Whenever possible, benefit renewal dates should be aligned across different programs to ma ke it easier for clients. Support services that are linguistically and culturally accessi ble. Individuals and families who speak a language other than English have the right to receive services in their preferred language. Support funding and resources that allow hiring of additional bilingual staff to pr ovide assistance to those in greatest need in their preferred language. Support technological advancement s that promote access to servi ces and administrative efficiencies. Promote and utilize technology to streamline benefits enrollmen t, such as autoenrolling clients and encouraging the use of selfservice tools. Expand and leverage datasharing agreements. Improve policies and systems to make it easier for agencies to share data to better serve clients. Focus on Effective Impleme ntation and Staff Training Reasonable timelines and funding for implementation of new poli cies/procedures. The State should work with stakeholders, including counties, when determining timelin es and funding for rolling out new policies and procedures. Ensure there is a training region for computer systems. Staff trainers need the ability to create test cases to avoid breaching confidentiality when teaching workers. The Stat e s h ou l d m a ke s u r e t h er e i s a d e di c a t ed training region for each of the systems used for human services programs. Include training funding as part of new laws/changes. Standardize all new laws or changes that impact the practice of human services programs to include training funding . Resources to train staff are vital to successful implementation of program changes. Create a statewide wor k g r o u p f o r t r a i n e r s / s t aff development man agers. T h i s f o r u m w o u l d a l l o w f o r sharing across the State on best practices and facilitate bette r collaboration. Increase Access to Safe, Affordable Housing Options Protect and increase supports for affordable housing and homele ssness prevention. Support a range of policies and programs that prevent and resolve homelessness and housing instability. S upport evidencebased programs, including housing first, rapid rehousing, longterm housing subsidies, and models that include wrap around transitional housing and housing support services design ed to promote housing stability. Additionally, PAGE | 39 Alameda County State Legislative Priorities 2018 support polices to end housing discrimination based on race, et hnicity, sovereignty, national origin, immigration status, gender, sexual orientation/gender identity, age, disability status, and socioeconomic status. Protect and enhance supports and services for individuals and f amilies experiencing homelessness. Support funding and policies that ensure adequate emergency she lter and transitional housing. Investments in supportive housing result in the decreased use of homeless shel ters, hospitals, emergency rooms, jails, and prisons. Increase income guidelines for housing assistance. Support funding and policies that raise the income percentage restrictions for housing assistance. In Alameda Coun ty, the Fair Market annual rent for a two bedroom apartment is approxima tely $26,000. For individuals and families living below the Federal Poverty level housing is out of reach without housing support programs. Research shows that sta ble, safe housing is critical to one's wellbeing, health, and longterm success. For additional homelessness and housing priorities, please see the Planning, Land Use, and Housing and Community Development Chapter. Early Care and Education Protect and increase access to quality early care and education for eligible families. Support funding, policies, and systems which create and expand equal access to s table, high quality early care and education programs for vulnerable families including children and youth i n foster care, families that are undocumented, or experiencing homelessness, a nd children with special needs. Streamline systems, where possibl e, to ease navigation and endu re a continuum of quality childcare that is culturally and developmentally appropriate. Enact and support policies which ease navigation of resources available for childcare and support family engagement. Reduce barriers to public and private collaboration to strength en childcare systems to more effectively and efficiently meet the needs of vulnerable children and famil ies. Support policies and programs that help parents make informed choices an d access information to support child development. Better Serve Boys and Men of Color and Fathers Create and expand ladders of opportunity for boys and men of co lor. Support policies and partnerships that focus on addressing critical challenges faced by boys and men of color, risk factors, and opportunities at key life stages to improve longterm outcomes and create ladder s of opportunity for all young people, to ensure they can reach their full potential. Promote fatherhood and fatherfriendly practices. Better serving fathers and men as partners in their families and communities results i n significant benefits in ter ms of child development/wellbeing, public health, community cohesion, and economic development/prosperity. Suppor t policies to develop demonstration programs to test fatherfriendly program designs that solicit a nd facilitate father engagement. Achieve Racial Equity and Ad vance Opportunities for All Protect and support public policies and practices that eliminat e racial disparities and ensure equitable opportunities and better futures for all Alameda County residen ts. Policies and practices should promote equity and reduce disparities based on race, ethnicity, soverei gnty, national origin, immigration status, gender, sexual orientation/gender identi ty, age, disability status, and socioeconomic status. Policies should address all forms of racism, particularly institutional and structural raci sm, which have played a central role historically and currently in creating and perpetuating persistent social and he alth inequities. PAGE | 40 Alameda County State Legislative Priorities 2018 Promote Economic Stability and Wealth Building Asset building policies and progra ms include a range of opportu nities including matchedsaving accounts, homeownership assistance, financial education, free tax prepara tion, access to affordable financial services, and credit building products and services. Broadening savings and a sset ownership opportunities will help move families and individuals from ju st breaking even to actually ge tting ahead. Remove asset limits for public assistance benefits. Asset limits create disincentives for lowincome families to save money for emergencies. Policies should promote savings and ensure individuals and families do not have to spend down any cushion t hey have before qualifying for public assistance. Maintain and expand savings programs. Policies should help lowincome individuals and families accumulate as s ets throug h increas ed s avings and inves tments . Su pport a variety of savings accounts and incentive programs that are designed to help lowincome individ uals build assets and opportunities (such as Individual Development Accounts (IDAs), Children's Savings Acco unts, Achieving a Better Life Experience (ABLE) Accounts, and retirement accounts). Restrict payday lending and other predatory financial products and services. Support policies that protect consumers from predatory credit products, specifically by prohi biting, or capping rates on, payday loans and promoting lowcost, consumer friendly alternatives. Expand the presence of mainstream financial institutions in und erserved communities. Many neighborhoods lack access to mainstream financial institutions and instead rely on predatory lenders, such as check cashers, payday lenders, and pawn shops that drain millio ns of dollars from communities through high fees and usurious loans. Support efforts to encourage safe, aff ordable financial products that protect income and assets. Expand access to credit and capital. Difficulty accessing financial services, affordable credit, and investment capital has long been a problem, especially in lowincome and h istorically disinvested communities. Support efforts to help lowincome indi viduals and communities gain acc ess to lowcost financial products and services, highreturn savings products, and investment capital that meet the specific needs of economically underserved communities. Protect assets and savings. Support policies that preserve assets and protect individuals a nd families from predatory practices. Specifically , protections for student loan borrowers and policies that promote access to education, lessen student debt burdens, and make loan repayment more manageable. Defaulting on a student loan can ruin a borrower's credit and impact future opportuniti es. Additionally, support protecting the continuation of Pell Grant and Ca l Grant loans that provide fin ancial aid in meeting the increasing cost of a college education. Promote retirement savings. L e s s t h a n h a l f o f C a l i f o r n i a ' s p r i v a t e s e c t o r w o r k e r s h a v e a c c e ss to an employersponsored retirement plan. Support State and federal p olicies that promote retirement savings that make it easier to save. Expand State tax cre dits for lowincome and foster families. Expand the State Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) to align with the federal EITC earned income definition and eligibility income ceilings. The California EITC earned income eligibility ceiling is lower than the federal EITC and excludes selfemployment earnings as earned income; th erefore, it only reaches a portion of the workers who are eligible for the federal EITC. California shoul d expand the State version of the EITC to reduce the regressive tax burden on the working poor, put more money i n their pockets, and make saving for the future possible. Restore the refundable portion of the Tax Credit for Child and Dependent Care Expenses. In 2011, California repealed the refundable portion of the Tax Credit fo r Child and Dependent Care Expenses (SB 86).This resulted in the loss of a benefit that provided $70 mi llion to California's lowestincome families with children. Support restoring the refundable portion of that tax credit. Expand refundable tax credits. More State tax credits (including the Dependent Tax Credit and the Tax Credit for Child and Dependent Care Expenses) should be fully r efundable so that all lowincome families, even those without a tax liability, can benefit from the credits. PAGE | 41 Alameda County State Legislative Priorities 2018 Implement a refundable tax credit for foster parents. This tax credit would be in line with the Continuum of Care Reform goal of increasing t he availability of homebased c are for youth. Reduce or eliminate Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) fees. Lowincome California families that receive CalWORKs spend approximately $19 million of their cash benefits each year in outofnetwork ATM fees to access the benefits on their EBT cards. Support actions that wi ll reduce or eliminate EBT fees. Fund asset building in county social service agencies. Alameda County Social Services Agency has piloted asset building programs for current and former public benefits recipients. These programs provided credit building, financial education, and oneonone coaching to help individuals and families save money and achieve selfsufficiency. California should consider funding similar ef forts and piloting innovations that build off the lessons learned in the asset building field. Invest in PlaceBased Initiatives Too many children in our communities are growing up in neighbor hoods with no grocery stores, closed parks, and s t r u g g l i n g s c h o o l s . R e c o g n i z i n g t h a t p e o p l e a n d p l a c e a r e i n e x t ricably linked, placebased initiatives take a comprehensive approach to community development and aim to revi talize multiple aspects of neighborhood to create lasting change for its residents. Promote and expand placebased strategies that concentrate reso urces and investment in communities with the highest levels of need. A placebased approach should include strategies to bring publi c benefits and services out into the community and to provide wealth building, wage subsidies, and job supports to residents. PRESERVE, RESTORE AND ENHANCE SAFETY NET PROGRAMS Strengthen CalWORKs CalWORKs (California Work Opportunity and Responsibility t o Kids) provides monthly income assistance and employmentrelated services aimed at moving children out of pov erty and helping families meet basic needs. Alameda County supports a range of policy changes to ensure thi s safety net program is addressing poverty and promoting financial stability. Increase the CalWORKs Maximum Aid Payment (MAP) and reinstate a costofliving adjustment (COLA). Suspension of the annual COLA and CalWORKs grant reductions dur ing the recession resulted in grants that are now below 50 percent of the federal poverty level and too small to cover basic necessities. Including recent increases, the current ma ximum grant is $714/month for a family of three and remains below pre recession levels. Eliminate asset limits for CalWORKs. Eliminating the asset limits altogether would reduce administra tive costs and allow staff to spend more time working with clients. Support policies that eliminate asset limits for CalWORKs eligibility. Specifically, liquid assets, which includ e cash on hand, personal checking and savings accounts, money market accounts, and shared accounts; and, the vehicle asset test. The State should eliminate the vehicle asset test for CalWORKs. For lowincome working fam ilies, having access to a reliable car is critical to finding and maintaining emplo yment and becoming financially stable. Increase CalWORKs earned income disregard. A CalWORKs family's grant decreases as the family earns more income. However, a portion of earned income, known as the \"earned income disregard,\" is excluded from the grant calculation. Support policies that increase or m odify the earned income disregard to encourage work and allow CalWORKs families to keep more of their earnings , and grant levels to be higher. Increase housing and homelessnes s assistance for CalWORKs famil ies. Lack of access to safe, affordable housing is a barrier for many CalWORKs families, including fami lies experiencing domestic violence and crime history. Support policies and programs that increa se income limits, expand access, provide case PAGE | 42 Alameda County State Legislative Priorities 2018 management, including additional funding for the CalWORKs Housi ng Support Program and policy changes that allow additional program flexibility to meet temporary and perm anent housing needs. Increase the Welfareto Work (WTW) time clock. California currently has a 24month WTW time clock; however, CalWORKs families often face multiple barriers to achi eving steady work that allows for financial stability. Support policies that increase flexibility and the t ime individuals can access education, training, and additional supportive services, including but not limited to ch ildcare, to pursue sustainably gainful employment. Support funding and services aimed for noncustodial parents of CalWORKs eligible children. Non custodial parents of children in poverty often fall behind in t heir child support payments because they, too, are struggling to get by. Support policies, funding, and services f or noncustodial parents to receive employment services that promote selfsufficiency and ability to care for their child(ren). Ensure CalWORKs is focused on alleviating poverty and preventin g material hardship among children and families. Support policies that help integr ate disparate CalWORKs program matic components into a comprehensive program that is customized to meet the evolving n eeds of each family, keep children out of poverty, and support parents in reaching economic stability. Increase the CalWORKs 48month lifetime limit. California is among the more r estrictive states with a 48 month lifetime time limit, a full year lower than the federal l imit of 60 months. Vulnerable families may need to return to aid due to economic downturns or new family hardships . Support policies that ensure benefits are in place when families need support. Support program flexibility for do mestic violence survivor and families. CalWORKs provides essential supports for lowincome families, including many survivors of d omestic violence and their children. The ability to receive CalWORKs and waive certain program requirements that may jeopardize the survivor's safety can often be the difference between building a life free from viole nce or faced with the impossible choice of returning to their abuser in order to meet the most basic econo mic needs for them and their children. Every eligible domestic violence survivor and families should receive the waivers they need to participate safely in this critical safety net program. Support programs and policies that help survivors and families experiencing domestic violence maintain CalWORKs eligibility, including nece ssary supportive services. Revise the budgeting methodology for the CalWORKs Single Alloca tion. The current methodology ties funding heavily on caseload, which can expand and contract quic kly with economic changes. This results in large variation of funding levels, and inability to respond to changing economic conditions. Support Adults Without Dependents L o w i n c o m e c h i l d l e s s a d u l t s a r e n o t e l i g i b l e f o r m o s t s t a t e o r f e d e r a l c a s h a i d p r o g r a m s . A c o m p r e h e n s i v e approach is needed to strengthen the social safety net for all individuals, including those who are not caring for children. Increase State and federal supports for lowincome adults witho ut dependents. Support policies that provide increased cash aid, employment assistance, and other su pportive services for lowincome adults without dependents. Programs sh ould recognize and address barri ers to employment while also encouraging p a r t i c i p a t i o n i n t h e l a b o r m a r k e t t o i m p r o v e e c o n o m i c w e l l b e i n g and not be designed to discourage participation in supportive pr ograms for people in need. Improve Access to Food Alameda County supports policies and programs that help childre n, individuals, and families access healthy, nutritious food. Specifically, we support streamlining and strengthening e nrollment into CalFresh and ensuring this vital program reaches individuals and families experiencing food inse curity. CalFresh is California's food stamp program [known as the Supplemental Nutrit ion Assistance Program (SNAP) at the federal level], which provides assistance for households to purchase nutritious food. PAGE | 43 Alameda County State Legislative Priorities 2018 Support efforts to simplify and streamline benefits enrollment. Support State efforts and rule changes to streamline and simplify applications and recertifications to en roll more eligible individuals and families in CalFresh which helps lift individuals, families, and children o ut of poverty. Support programs and policies that improve access to healthy an d nutritious food. Support programs and policies that improve access to healthy and nutritious food for physically or medically homebound individuals, including individuals and families living in remote areas. Increase CalFresh outreach and enrollment for older adults and people with disabilities. According to the Alameda County Community Food Bank, residents over 50 years old now make up more than onethird of their clients. This need is only expec ted to increase as older adults are the fastest growing s egment of the population in Alameda County. Support increased CalFresh outreach and enro llment efforts for seniors and people with disabilities along with efforts to increase the minimum benefit allotment (currently $16/month). Support expanding \"food as medicine\" efforts to get meals and groceries to homebound and physically or cognitively impaired individuals. Promote CalFresh access to foster youth. Many eligible current and former foster youth are not accessing CalFresh. Barriers exist for current and former foster youth tr ying to access CalFresh be nefits. It is important that vulnerable populations have access to the maximum benefit for which they are eligible. Support policies and efforts that promote crosscoordination, increased outreach , and enrollment in the CalFresh program for foster youth. Support efforts to maintain benefi ts enrollments and reduce chu rn in CalFresh. Churn occurs when a client exits and then reenters the program within four months; this pr ocess results in a loss of benefits for the individual or family and is costly to both clients and the agen cies that administer the program. Support policies that help individuals and families maintain benefits. Specifica lly, support policies that increase the number of months an individual or family re ceives in Transitional CalFres h benefits. Increase student food security. The Alameda County Community Food Bank estimates that one in th ree children face the threat of hunge r every day. Support policies that increase enrollment in school meal programs, maximize universal meal provisions to all students in high poverty schools, and reduce college student hunger. Expand access to meals during school breaks. When school is not in session, many lowincome children lose access to free and reducedprice school breakfasts, lunches, an d afterschool snacks th ey rely on during the regular school year. Support policies to coordinate and expand access to free meals when school is not in session, including the summer mo nths, and connect kids and thei r families to healthy nutrition assistance. Support food banks. The Alameda County Community Food Bank estimates that one in fi ve Alameda County residents turn to the Food Bank for assistance. Support efforts to help local food banks secure nutritious food and assist individuals and families in applying for CalFresh. S pecifically, funding the State Emergency Food Assistance Program and expanding tax credits for food donations . Better Assist Immigrants, Refugees, and Asylees Currently a third of Alameda County residents are foreignborn. The existing system of services and providers who work with immigrants, including undocumented immigrants, refuge es, and asylees is com plicated and can be difficult to navigate and access . As one of eight RefugeeImpac ted counties in California, Alameda County recognizes the unique needs of i mmigrant populations to access services, gain employment, and integrate into their new communities. Protect and increase access to services for immigrants, includi ng undocumented immigrants, refugees, and asylees. In particular, immigrants, including undocumented immigrants, n eed access to basic assistance, including health care, nutrition supports, housing, early care and education, and culturally competent and quality legal services to keep families together and secure; an d, communities whole. Alameda County opposes PAGE | 44 Alameda County State Legislative Priorities 2018 policies and initiatives that place restrictions on services an d benefits to immigrants, including undocumented immigrants. Additional supports and services for refugees and asylees. Support additional State and federal funding to expand services available to refugees and asylees. Specifically , support increasing Refugee Cash Assistance payment levels, providing homelessness and housing supports, ex panding employment and vocational training programs, and increasing other supportive services. For more information, please see the Immigration Chapter. ADVANCE FOSTER YOUTH WELLBEING AND STRENGTHEN CHILD WELFARE SE RVICES The Alameda County Social Services Agency's Department of Child ren and Family Services serves children and youth who have experienced, or a re atrisk of experiencing, abu se, or neglect. Preserve and Enhance Services and Programs Alameda County supports a range of increases in child welfare f unding and supportive services to improve the wellbeing of children, inclu ding undocumented children. Successfully implement Continuum of Care Reform (CCR) and Resou rce Family Approval (RFA). As the State moves forward with efforts to move children out of congregate c are and into more fami lybased settings, support continued conversations with stakeholders ensuring ther e are adequate county resources to support the transition. Funding is needed to recruit/retain additional care providers, ensure adequate behavioral health services, provide supportive services and resources to families and children, and successfully implement RFA. Ensure that placements are available, fully funded, and support ed with services. Specifically, placements need to meet the needs of youth to support their tra nsition to a familylike setting but who currently need a more intensive p lacement and supportive servic es. As part of the CCR, California Department of Social Services (CDSS) should pay special attenti on to youth with special needs, such as those who have experienced commercial sexual exploitation and/or yout h struggling with alcohol or other drug addiction. Protect foster youth to make certain that placements intended t o meet their specific needs for care and services are available and willing to accept the youth for placement. Protections and oversight are needed to require Foster Family A gencies (FFAs) and ShortTerm Residential Treatment Centers (STRTC) to accept youth who are available for foster care placement when t he FFA or STRTC has an available bed and can provide the care and services needed by the youth. Strengthen CCR implementation by developing standards for FFA a nd STRTC service delivery. These requirements will establish a minimum level of services for fos ter youth and address inconsistent service provision among providers to meet the needs of foster y outh and improve their wellbeing. Part of a potential solution is to provide Community Care Licensing with additional oversight authority of FFA service provision. Assist with the placement of children in family based care by i mproving RFA program requirements. For example: Allowing for an extension of time past 90 days, under certain c onditions, for the completion of the psychosocial assessment or preapproval training when a place ment is made in a relative's home for an emergency or co mpelling reason. Align RFA requirements with existing requirements in the Inters tate Compact for the Placement of Children (ICPC). Amendments are needed to clarify that ICPC exp edited placements can be processed as an emergency placement under the rules of RFA. Such a change wi ll help counties continue to comply with the ICPC timeframes and pla ce children according to RFA ru les. Provide flexibility in the approval process to facilitate place ment in a relative's home through ICPC despite jurisdictional delays. PAGE | 45 Alameda County State Legislative Priorities 2018 Promote local agreements between counties and placement provide rs that deliver safe and caring homes to foster youth. An example is allowing for flexibility that upholds a county's placement agreement with an FFA or STRTC for a youth with high service and care nee ds that is funded by an amount above statewide rates for FFAs or group homes when no other local pla cement structured to meet the youth's needs is available. Ensure that all youth are placed with relatives whenever possib le. A change to State law is needed to provide a Child Welfare Agency with statutory authority to supp ort changing a foster youth's placement to a relative despite the child having a \"stable\" placement in foster care with a nonrelative, at any stage o f d e p e n d e n c y . T h i s m e a n s t h a t a p l a c e m e n t w i t h a r e l a t i v e w o u l d not be denied based on the ordinary bonding or attachment that results from the child's ti me in a nonrelative placement. Such a change recognizes that permanency with a relative over a nonre lative is in the longterm best interests of the child. Additionally, a change is needed to ensure that relatives are n ot unfairly penalized by a denial of foster care funds for future placements in their care, after a child has be en removed from their home and placed in a higher level of care even when the removal was solely due to the child's behavior and the relative caregiver's inability to maintain the child in their home. Funding for services and income supports needed by parents seek ing to reunify with their children who are in foster care. This could include: Funding for childcare, housing, immigration legal services, and other necessary supportive services. Additional funding and policies to support the availability and quality of substance abuse programs for parents. Specifically, support of substance abuse family re sidential programs that allow for 1) an entire family, including both parents, to reside together, and 2) sing le fathers to reside in the program with their child(ren). Typically, residential programs do not allow the fa m i l y t o r e m a i n t o g e t h e r , w h i c h c a u s e s additional trauma to children who must separate from one or bot h parents. Additional resources and policies that promote better outcomes for children . Examples include culturally relevant mental health services, educational supports, employme nt/linked learning opportunities, matched savings accounts, developmental child care (including postperm anency), respite services for relative and foster caregivers, services and resourc es promoting father engagement, housing subsidies, onestop community centers serving families (e.g. with employment, housing, and he althcare), and improved mental health service delivery to foster youth through the increased availability of licensed clinicians trained in empiricallybased treatments for youth who h ave experienced trauma. Elimination of resource limits on income supports and benefits given directly to the youth such as matched savings accounts, Supplemental Se curity Income (SSI), and CalFr esh. Providing additional resources to foster youth will increase the chances of their success ful transition to adulthood. The continued provision of flexible funding through the Title I VE Waiver. The waivers have enabled counties to increase the use of community services to prevent c hild abuse and neglect, divert families away from formal child welfa re services, and increase permanence for children. Strengthen policies, services, and other resources to address t he disproportionate presence of African American, Latino, and Native American children in foster care. Support leadership and funding to improve conditions in lowincome communiti e s o f c o l o r t h a t c o n t a i n h i g h levels of unemployment, crime, homelessness, substance abuse, and disproportionate experiences with the child welfare system. Services and resources are needed to assist children and families early on t o prevent any need for child welfare services in the future. Increase funding to support counties in monitoring and providin g s e r v i c e s t o f o s t e r y o u t h w h o a r e authorized by the court to recei ve psychotropic medications. The children served by the foster care system have experienced severe trauma; for some, medication is appropr iate when thoughtfully prescribed as part of an overall treatment plan that includes nonpharmacological int erventions as well. Support additional funding for behavioral health services for youth and to support countie s in providing oversight and monitoring of psychotropic medications prescribed to foster youth. PAGE | 46 Alameda County State Legislative Priorities 2018 Expand child welfare funding and resources to populations with unique needs: Youth in foster care who are also parents. Parenting foster youth are in particular need of services that promote their educational attainment, parenting skills, and res ources that support their transition to independence. Children of foster youth. Provide resources and supports f or children of foster youth. In particular, support continuing to provide resources, including but not limited to a n Infant Supplement, while the parent is temporarily away from placement but still caring for their chil d (for instance when they are living in a shelter). This change will help ensure food and other basic necessities t o the infant until they both return to an eligible foster setting. Undocumented children of undocumented parents who are under chi ld welfare supervision. Additional resources are needed to ensure that these families receive the necessary services to prevent the child from entering into or remaining in fo ster care. Support increased fu nding to address reunification barriers faced by many immigrant families in the child welfare system. Specifical ly, support increased funding for the Reuniting Immigrant Families Act (SB 1064). Families who speak a language other than English. Resources are needed to support counties hiring additional bilingual staff to pr ovide assistance to children an d families in their preferred language. Support for children of incarcerated parents. Additional funding and programs that promote the health, safety, and wellbeing of the children of incarcerated parents and the efforts of parents to reunify with their children are needed. Parents and children with disabilities. Foster children with disabilities, their parents, and their car egivers need additional support to navigat e systems and services that m ay meet their developmental, educational, and medical needs. Disabled parents also may need addi tional resour ces and support to access needed services. Commercially Sexually Exploited Children (see section below). Establish Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits for all e ligible foster youth and allow those benefits to remain in suspense for the duration of their stay in foster care. Current law leads to situations where foster youth who are both disabled and from impoverished backgr ounds risk being dropped from, or not able to access, SSI even though they meet other eligibility criteria . Support policy changes that ensure all foster youth who are eligible can apply for SSI benefits and maintain their SSI eligibility throughout their involvement in foster care, without the need for an annual temporary suspen sion of the Title IVE or federal payment. Support agreements with consulates and foreign governments for the protection of foster youth. Statewide agreements with foreign consulates and governments ar e needed to enhance the services provided to minors and their parents when the parent or child i s a foreign national. These agreements should clarify the responsibilities between parties to protect the saf ety of minors during custody and dependency proceedings involving minors who have experienced abuse or negl ect. Support Caregivers and Provide Permanency for Foster Youth Increase funding for foster and adoptive parent recruitment, tr aining, and retention. Alameda County encourages additional support, funding, and other resources des igned to increase the number of qualified caregivers available to provide stable and loving foster and ad optive homes. Examples of supports and resources deemed critical by caregivers: Increased funding for and access to subsidized childcare and re spite care. Funding for onetime expenses, such as a bed. Specialized training and targeted support services, including t hose that offer inhome based services, for caregivers of foster youth with acute mental health needs or co mmercially sexually exploited children, or disabled children. A statewide public education camp aign to promote interest in fo ster parenting. A refundable tax credit for foster parents. PAGE | 47 Alameda County State Legislative Priorities 2018 Expand funding and eligibility time for postplacement services to support permanence for children who have left foster care through re unification, adoption, or guard ianship. Policies should help maintain the child in their home and prevent reentry to foster care. For example, housing and child care assistance to help parents provide a safe and stable environment as well as superv ision for their child(ren) while they are at work or school. There are limited housing and child care slots avail able through existing resources, and additional resources should be targeted specifically to these families. Ot her examples include substance abuse treatment and mental health services that are culturally responsive to th e child and the adoptive parent or guardian. Provide KinGAP benefits to children whose relative guardianshi p was established in Probate Court. Although Probate Court guardianships with a nonrelative can be eligible for Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) Foster Care payme nts, relative guardianships es tablished in Probate Court do not qualify for KinGAP, even though many of the se children have needs similar to youth who have a guardianship established in Juvenile Court. Pr oviding KinGAP benefits to th ese probate guardianship youth will improve their transition to adulthood an d may reduce their need for soc ial services as an adult. Remove barriers to legal guardianship for youth. Current law doesn't allow fo r guardianships by Non Relative Extended Family Members (NREFMs) and nonrelated foste r parents for youth under age six. Support providing statutory authorization for courts to establish guard ianships when a NREFM is the caregiver to a child under age six or to a child within a sibling group with at leas t one sibling under age six, whenever the child is unable to return to their parent's or guardian's care. The inte nt of this change is not to divert children away from adoption but instead provide as many options available as possible to provide legal permanence for foster children. Continued support for policies and resources that meet the need s o f L G B T Q ( l e s b i a n , g a y , b i s e x u a l , transgender, and questioning) foster youth and recognize a yout h's gender identity. Alameda County encourages additional laws and policies, such as SB 731 (Statut es of 2015), that promote the protections of rights of foster youth who are LGBTQ and are supportive of a fo ster youth's gender identity. Computer data systems and forms should allow for recognition of gender identi ty in addition to the youth's gender assigned at birth. Additional, resources are also needed to further the rec ruitment and retention of resource families that will provide effective care for LGBTQ youth. Support the enhancement and strengthening of connections betwee n foster youth and persons in their support network. Additional resources and improved policies are needed that help maintain networks of service providers, family, and friends that serve the best inte rests of foster youth, even though they are not the parent or resource parent to the youth. These support networks are vital to the health and wellbeing of foster youth. Allow for continued benefits after age 18 for all former foster youth who exited from foster care to a guardianship prior to their 18th birthday. Current law limits eligibility for these benefits based on th e youth's age at the time the guardianship was established. These limits have created a disincentive for permanency for these children. Alameda County supports policies that extend Fe deral and State KinGAP (to relative guardians) and State AFDCFC (to nonrelated guardians) benefits to age 21 for youth who otherwise meet eligibility criteria except for the age at w hich the guardianship was estab lished. Improve Assistance and Services for TransitionAge Youth Additional supports and programs for transitionage foster yout h (ages 14 - 21). In October 2010, California passed AB 12, also known as the California Fostering Connections to Success Act, in response to the federal Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptio ns Act (Public Law 110351). AB 12 changed foster care significantly by opt ionally extending foster care u ntil age 21. Although some transitionage foster youth now have the benefit of ex tended foster care, these youth often remain in need of additional funding, policies, and programs that support their transition out of fos ter care and into independent adulthood. Specifically, Alameda County supports: Increased financial support for programs that assist foster you th in the transition to financial stability. Examples include postemancipati on assistance such as secondary education, job training, housing, access to health care, and tax credits to employers for the employment of a current or former foster youth. PAGE | 48 Alameda County State Legislative Priorities 2018 Additional funding for safe and stable housing and supportive s ervices such as substance abuse or mental health treatment. There is a specific need for financial support of a continuum o f care of substance abuse programs for minors to ensure th at all youth in need are able t o receive services. Flexibility with placement requirements for nonminor dependent s (NMDs) in Extended Foster Care who are in need of inpatient substance abuse treatment. If a NMD's temporary stay in an inpatient facility could be considered a Supervised Independent Living Placement, for ex ample, this would allow the otherwise eligible youth to remain in Extended Foster Care and receive related ser vices that support their transition to independence, rather than forcing their exit from care. Expand Independent Living Program (ILP) eligibility to include older youth in Family Maintenance. Youth who are nearing adulthood (age 16 - 1 8 ) a n d r e c e i v i n g i n h o m e c h i l d w e l f a r e s e r v i c e s , s u c h a s F a m i l y Maintenance, are in need of services supporting their transitio n to independence as healthy and responsible adults. An expansion of eligibi lity requirements for ILP funds could allow for the provision of services to these youth and better prepare them for adulthood. Provide counties funding to fulfill credit report monitoring an d assistance activities to foster youth. Identity theft is a major concern for youth in foster care and can destroy their credit. For foster children w h o \" a g e o u t \" o f t h e s y s t e m a s y oung adults, the consequences o f identity theft are particularly devastating and can make it difficult to rent an apartment or o btain educational loans. Support additional funding for counties to assist with monitoring credit reports o n behalf of foster youth and ensuring that youth receive assistance in interpreting their reports and clearing a ny inaccuracies, as required by State and federal law. Provide funding to support reproductive health training. Although some funding is currently available for reproductive health education of foster youth through grants, a dedicated funding stream is needed statewide to ensure that these trainings are available to all foster yout h, as well as child welfare staff and foster parents who are working with or caring for foster youth. Foster youth a re a vulnerable population in particular need of education that promotes their he alth and provides the knowledge needed to prevent sexually transmitted infections and teen pregnancy. Ensure the Safety and WellBeing of Commercially Sexually Explo ited Children (CSEC) Additional funding and supports for Commercially Sexually Explo ited Children (CSEC). Responding to CSEC requires a multipronged response t h a t d o e s n o t c r i m i n a l i z e t h e youth for their actions and includes prevention, intervention, and after care. Support additional fu nding and resources, beyond what is currently provided to counties, to expand training, tailor services, and support collaborative work with other systems. More funding is needed to address the immediate needs of victim s, including clothing and safe shelter, and to provide longterm services to assist CSEC victims in achieving positive outcomes of permanency and wellbeing. Protect and enhance funding for homeless youth. The Runaway and Homeless Youth Act (RHYA) authorizes communitybased runaway and homeless youth projects to provide temporary shelter and care to runaways or otherwise homeless youth who are in need of temporary shelte r , c o u n s e l i n g , a n d a f t e r c a r e s e r v i c e s . Approximately 1 out of every 5 homeless youth are victims of tr afficking, with higher rates of victimization occurring for LGBTQ youth and youth with previous involvement i n the child welfare system. RHYA provides necessary funding to provide for these vulnerable young people. Support enhanced funding for RHYA, or similar introduced legislation for runaway and homeless youth, recognizing the increasing need to provide for CSEC and vulnerable youth who ex perience trafficking and exploi tation. Align Child Welfare Requirements with Local Best Practice Effor ts Flexibility allowing for exempti ons in existing requirements co ncerning social worker contacts with foster youth that unfairly penalize counties. Policy changes are needed to remove penalties when social worke rs are PAGE | 49 Alameda County State Legislative Priorities 2018 unable to make monthly face to face contact with a foster youth who has run away from placement and his or her current whereabouts are unknown. The existing requirements do not consider and give credit for the social worker's efforts to locate and make contact with the youth. SUPPORT ADULTS, SENIORS, AN D PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES The growing demographics of aging require a fundamental shift i n how we view and incorporate aging in our system of services and in our communities. It is projected that the Alameda County senior population will increase by over 40 percent in the next ten years and approximately 50 p ercent of all seniors in Alameda County do not have adequate financial resources to address their daily needs. In addition, approximately one in five people with disabilities in Alameda County liv e below the federal poverty l ine. Protect and Enhance Systems and Programs Protect and increase funding available to develop and su pport affordable, accessible, and integrated housing options for seniors and persons with disabilities. Older adults and persons with disabilities often live on fixed incomes and appropriate housing options are scarce and incomes are not increasing at the same rate as housing prices. Local affordable housing resources are sever ely limited, which is adversely impacting the health, care, and quality of life of seniors and people with di sabilities. Fiftyfour percent of adults over age 65 live below 200 percent of federal poverty, and people with disa bilities are twice as likely as others to live in poverty. Inability to find or sustain stable housing results in h e a l t h s y s t e m c o s t s w h e n p e o p l e c a n n o t transition from institutional care. Support housing strategies that allow people to modify their home, access assisted living, health and supportive services, leverage Medic aid to access housing dollars and find housing after a health crisis for older adults and people with disabili ties. Restore funding for InHome Supportive Services (IHSS). IHSS is a federal, State, and locally funded program designed to provide assistance to those eligible aged, blind, a nd disabled individuals who, without this care, would be unable to remain safely in their own homes. IHSS provi ders and clients have experienced a series of cuts in recent years. Support a permanent restoration of these cuts. Oppose IHSS cost shifts to counties. The 201718 State Budget disconti nued the Coordinated Care Init iative (CCI), requiring a new IHSS Maintenance of Effort (MOE). The ne w IHSS MOE and some state mitigation measures provide shortterm reli ef from a significant cost shif t from the State to counties; however, without additional resources, Alameda County could face cuts to other v ital social services in the coming years. Support efforts to better align IHSS fundi ng responsibility with progra mmatic oversight and responsibility, and opposes policies and efforts to shift I HSS program costs to counties. E n s u r e I H S S r e c i p i e n t s a r e a b l e t o f i n d c a r e t h a t m e e t s t h e i r n eeds. New IHSS overtime rules could potentially place an undue burden on recipients and make it mor e difficult to find and manage providers. Alameda County supports policies that streamline administration and make it easy for recipients to access and manage their care. Protect vulnerable populations in community care facilities. Licensed community care facilities, including residential care facilities for the elderly and day programs fo r adults and seniors are inspected by California Community Care Licensing. Support annual unannounced inspection visits. Restore cuts to the Supplemental Security Income/State Suppleme ntary Payment (SSI/SSP) and reinstate an annual State costofliving adjustment (COLA). SSI is federally funded and provides income support for individuals who are aged 65 or older, blind, or have a disabili ty; the SSP is the California program that augments SSI. Deep cuts to SSI/SSP over the past few years have compromi sed the ability of lowincome California seniors and people with disabilities to afford necessities, such as hou sing and groceries. These cuts are exacerbated by the fact that SSI/SSP recipients are not eligible for food assi stance through the CalFresh Program. Support restoring these benefits and including an annual COLA. Addition ally, support policies that allow SSI recipients to access CalFresh benefits. Alam eda County opposes any cuts to these benefits. Preserve, support and expand pro grams for equitable access to a dvance care planning (ACP) and endof life services at any age. Advance care planning gives people a way to think about death a nd dying allowing PAGE | 50 Alameda County State Legislative Priorities 2018 them to confront dying directly instead of being a \"vague, unma nageable concept\" or leaving the end of life decisions up to others once the patient is unable to meaningful ly participate in the process. Supporting programs that provide culturally relevant outreach and understa nding of palliative care and hospice to our diverse populations will increase equitable access and utilizat ion of endof life services. Fully support the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The ADA prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities in employment, transportation, public accommo dation, communications, and governmental activities. Alameda County oppose s all efforts to erode the leg islative mandate of the ADA. Specifically, we oppose ADA notification bills that seek to create barriers to f iling a complaint, resulting in loss of access and civil rights. Increase employment opportunities for older adults and individu als with disabilities. Support policies that help older adults and individuals with disabilities access trai ning and employment opportunities that lead to competitive and integrated employment. Specifically, support po licies such as subsidized employment or tax incentives that encourage employ ers to hire older adults and in dividuals with disabilities. Support Achieving a Better Life Experience (ABLE) Act implement ation and improvements. Created in 2014, ABLE accounts are taxadvantaged savings accounts for individua ls with disabilities and their families. Savings in ABLE accounts do not affect eligibility for SSI, Medicaid an d other public benefits. Support the ABLE Act, the California enactment, and policie s that enhance and improve the current laws. Support fair access to resources and services. Older adults and people with disabilities have the right to liv e free from abuse, neglect, exploitation, and discriminatory prac tices. Older adults and people with disabilities have the right to services that promote independence and autono my. Support policies that promote parity of resources and services among older adults and people with disab ilities, including those with cognitive impairments, regardless of their social, economic, and immigrat ion status. Support services that are linguistically and culturally accessi ble. Individuals and families who speak a language other than English have the right to receive services in their preferred language. Support funding and resources that allow hiring of additional bilingual staff to pr ovide assistance to older adults and people with disabilities in their preferred language. Coordinate the System of Care for Older Adults Systematic inefficiencies are extremely costly while keeping pe ople from getting the essential care and services they need. To accommodate the gro wing numbers of older adults w ho need services and serve them cost effectively, Alameda County supports a coordinated service deli very system that protects, supports, and advocates for an aging population. Specifi cally, we support the integrati on and simplification of the complex system of senior services to ensure policies and programs are consumerfo cused and that residents have access to and receive the services they need. Preserve, support and expand programs and policies that promote Healthy Aging/Aging in Place. Older adults often lack access to information and resources about soc ial service and health issues, or are unaware of preventative measures they can take to remain healthier for lon ger. Supports policies that promote healthy aging, independence, and wellbein g of seniors who wish to age in place, or who wish to remain in their homes as they age. Protect and increase funding for Area Agency on Aging (AAA) Pro grams. The services that the AAA provides to residents age 60 and older ar e often underfunded or restrict ed. Support increased State and federal funding and flexibility. Improve access, coordination, and integration of services for older adults. Systematic inefficiencies are extremely costly while keeping people from g etting the essential care and services they need. To accommodate the growing numbers who need services and serve them costeffectively, support policies and programs that improve access, coordination, and integration of care, including further developing and improving the Cal MediConnect program. Reduce nutrition insecurity for seniors. According to the Alameda County Community Food Bank, residents over 50 years old now make up more than onethird of their clie nts. This need is only expected to increase as older adults are the fastest growing segment of the population in Alameda County; however, State and federal PAGE | 51 Alameda County State Legislative Priorities 2018 funding for senior nutrition is limited and restrictive. Suppor t protecting and increasing funding and greater funding flexibility for senior nut rition programs and services. Support and increase funding for Elder Courts. Many seniors find the legal system complicated and difficult to navigate, which creates a barrier to remediation of legal is sues such as elder abuse, housing disputes, and more. Elder Courts facilitate legal issues for seniors, includi ng coordinating, scheduling, and making referrals to providers. Preserve and expand programs that support caregivers. Families are the major provider of longterm care for older adults, but research has shown that caregiving exacts a heavy emotional and financial toll. Almost half of all caregivers are over age 50, making them more vulnerable to a decline in their own health, and onethird describe their own health as fair to poor. Support increased ef forts to support caregivers through creation of a BlueRibbon Caregiver Council and restoration of funding to Car egiver Resource Centers. Support adequate and stable funding for the State LongTerm Car e Ombudsman Program (LTCOP). LTCOP is mandated, through State and f ederal law, to protect resident s' rights and ensure that residents are treated with respect and dignity. Complaints identified and investigate d by Ombudsmen are often the precursors to more severe cases of abuse and neglect. Increased ongoing fundi ng would enable the program to conduct vital unannounced monitoring visits to all longterm care facilities in Alameda County; recruit, supervise and train volunteer Ombudsmen; investigate more complaints per year; and, advocate for residents' rights and safety. P r o t e c t a n d i n c r e a s e f u n d i n g , c a p a c i t y , a n d a c c e s s t o c r i t i c a l senior services and programs. Support restorations and expansions of p rograms that help older adults age with independence and dignity in their homes and communities. This incl udes the Adult Day Health Care, Multipurpose Senior Services Program (MSSP), PACE (Program of AllInclude Care for the Elderly), and other MediCal funded services. Promote retirement savings. L e s s t h a n h a l f o f C a l i f o r n i a ' s p r i v a t e s e c t o r w o r k e r s h a v e a c c e ss to an employersponsored retirement plan. Support State and federal p olicies that promote retirement savings and make it easier to save. Increase funding for programs that support the integration of h ealth care and social services focused on aging and advance care planning. Funding a whole person approach to care and reducing barriers t o the integration of health and social service systems will increase the coordination of services and allow sharing of vital health information. The in tegration of advance care plann ing into a health and social services regimen allows time to put social supports in place before selfcare an d mobility are limited by the downward trajectory of a terminal illness. The ability to stay at home with integra ted health care and soci al services may reduce hospital readmissions, futile treatments, and suffering from sy mptom burdens, while also improving the quality of care at the end of life. Preserve, restore and increase funding for communitybased prog r a m s f o r s e n i o r s a n d p e o p l e w i t h disabilities. Over the past few years, senior safety net funding for multiple programs under the Older C a l i f o r n i a n s A c t a n d O l d e r A m e r i c a n s A c t h a s b e e n e l i m i n a t e d o r severely reduced. Support preserving, reinstating and increasing funding for these and other programs that support seniors and people with disabilities. Advance collaborations and policies that establish partnerships with communitybased services to leverage existing and new resources for better outcomes. Support policies and regulations that embrace communityservice collaborations and personcentered programs t o improve health outcomes for older adults and people with disabilities. Increase funding to expand services specifically for older adul ts with mental health and cooccurring substance abuse issues. Behavioral health concerns are not a normal part of the aging p rocess. Mental illness and substance use disorders are major impediments to living wel l in old age; they cause considerable personal suffering and make it difficult for older people to achieve the ir potential. Older adults who become disabled by mental illness deserve the same guarantee of care already exten ded to those who face other kinds of disabilities. For more information on these issues, please see the Behavioral Health section in the Health Chapter. PAGE | 52 Alameda County State Legislative Priorities 2018 Protect Vulnerable Adults Alameda County Division of Adult Protection consists of Adult P rotective Services (APS), Office of the Public GuardianConservator (PG/PC), an d the Public Administrator's Of fice (PA). Together these programs provide a continuum of services that form a safety net for vulnerable adu lts. Support adequate and stable funding for APS training . Training for APS workers and their partner agencies is severely underfunded and has not kept pace with rising cases . It is imperative that APS workers receive comprehensive training so that t hey may provide elder and depen dent adult victims of abuse, neglect, and exploitation with the same types of essential services that chi ld abuse victims receive. APS programs require ongoing State and federal funding and support to be able to mai ntain and expand a highlytrained workforce and successfully serve this vuln erable elders and dependent adu lts. Additionally, resour ces are necessary to address the needs of underserved groups, including rural older adults, elders of color, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning (LG BTQ) elders. Support increased State funding for APS training. Protect and enhance supports to p reserve housing and prevent ev iction for seniors and dependents adults who are victims of abuse or neglect. Senior and dependent adults who a re the victims of abuse or neg lect are among the most vulnerable to becoming homeless. Support State a nd federal funding for services, case management, and resources to hel p preserve stable housing for v ulnerable elders and dependent adults. Protect and increase services and supports for elderly or depen dent adults who are victims of financial abuse. Financial abuse is estimated to account for 40 percent of all f orms of reported abuse against seniors. Dependent adults also face similar challenges. Additional servi ces and supports are needed for education, prevention, and investigation of financial abuse and exploitati on of these populations. Raise awareness of elder and dependent adult abuse. Specifically, support State and federal efforts to better define elder and dependent abuse and ensure consistency in data tracking and reporting. Efforts should be made to lift up the issue an d raise public awareness of this silent epidemic. Enhance coordination to respond to crimes against elders and de pendent adults. Support State and federal e f f o r t s t o m a k e i t e a s i e r f o r a g e n c i e s ( i n c l u d i n g l a w e n f o r c e m e nt, District Attorneys, Public Guardians, Victim/Witness Programs, and the Victims Compensation Board, et c.) that respond to crimes against elder and dependent adults to coordinate se rvices. This should include su pport to identify, prevent, and remedy elder and dependent adult abuse. Improve data collection on elder and dependent adult abuse. There is a lack of good data on elder and dependent abuse. The most recen t national numbers (from 2009) e stimate that 11 percent of older Americans experience abuse, neglect, or ex ploitation in the community (th is survey excluded individuals in nursing homes and other longterm care facilities). The actual prevalence is likely even higher. The National Council on Aging also estimates that only one in 14 cases of abuse come to the a ttention of officials. Addi tional State and federal support is needed to improve loca l data collection on the incid ence of elder and dependent adult abuse. Protect and increase services and supports for elderly or depen dent adults who are victims of crimes. Individuals with disabilities and seniors have a disproportiona tely high victimization rate. According to the most recent Bureau of Justice Statist ics report, the rate of serious violent crimes is three times higher for those with disabilities than those without. Additional services and suppor ts are needed for education, prevention, and investigation of abuse and exploi tation of seniors and individu als with disabilities. Protect funding that State Healt h Insurance Assistance Program (SHIP, known as HICAP in California). Each year SHIP supports over 15,000 c ounselors who pr ovide free, sta tespecific assistance to over six million people. In Alameda County, HICAP is provided by Legal Assistance for Se niors, and helps thousands of people navigate the complexities of Medicare, many of them referred to HICAP by the Medicare help line. Support policies that protect State and fed eral funding for SHIP/HICAP. I n c r e a s e s u p p o r t a n d s t a t e w i d e c o o r d i n a t i o n o f A P S . There are currently inconsistencies among APS programs in California counties. Support efforts to better coor dinate and promote uniformity in the development and adoption of best practices in protective servic es casework throughout the State. These PAGE | 53 Alameda County State Legislative Priorities 2018 efforts should also include consistency in data collection so t hat there is comparable data across counties and updating of the APS State Regulations. Increased safeguards and protections for adults with caregivers . Support increased protections for adults who name caregivers as their power of attorney, executor of the ir wills, or identify the caregiver as an heir. It is important to ensure the adult is making an informed decision an d is not being exploited. Require California Department of Developmental Services (CDDS) to act as limited probate conservator. Require CDDS, which oversees the R egional Centers, to act as pr obate conservator when one of their consumers is in need of a limited conservatorship and there is no appropriate family member or friend able to act. CDSS currently has this capability and does petition in s o m e c a s e s , b u t p r e f e r s n o t t o a c t . T h i s leaves the burden on individual counties, a model which does no t best serve people with developmentally disabilities. Oppose making LantermanPetrisShort (LPS) hearing records publ ic. LPS hearings concern the involuntary civil commitment of an individual to a mental health institutio n in the State of California. Alameda County believes LPS proceedings should continue to be confidential. Increase funding for the Public G uardianConservator (PG/PC). Counties currently augment funding for PG/PC with no dedicated State funding source to meet the increa sing demand for services. Support a budget allocation from the State to pro vide counties with additional f unding for this vital and critical service. Protect the rights of individuals with mental illness. Current law provides that individuals cannot be indiscriminately placed in inv oluntary settings without due pro cess, which includes LPS conservatorship and a finding of grave disability. Alameda County opposes efforts tha t could circumvent due process and the protections that are currently i n place to protect the rights o f residents who have a mental illness. Better Serve Veterans Alameda County supports policies that assist veterans with acce ssing benefits, housing, and stable employment. Increase employment opportunities for veterans. Support policies that help veterans access employment i n t h e p u b l i c a n d p r i v a t e s e c t o r s . S p e c i f i c a l l y , s u p p o r t f u n d i n g for priorlearning assessments that allow veterans to earn college credit for their military training and skills learned in service. Reduce veteran homelessness and provide supportive treatment an d services. Support a range of policies that address the root causes of veteran homelessness. Specifica lly, policies that improve employment opportunities, increase substance abuse prevention and treatmen t programs, establish affordable housing, and improve rehabilitation efforts for homeless veterans. Increase funding for County Vete rans Service Offices (CVSOs). CVSOs assist California veterans in navigating the claims process and accessing all State and federal benefits for which they are eligible. EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION PLANNING COUNCIL The Planning Council will initiate and promote efforts to prote ct and increase local, state, federal and private funding for Early Care and Educat ion (ECE) and monitor, take po sitions and make recommendations on State issues, legislation and initiatives that significantly impact E CE quality, access, affordability and racial disparity. It will support increasing the spectrum of family engagement and f amily leadership opportunities in ECE, and advocate for family centered, inclusive, developmentally and cu lturally appropriate practices for all children in all Early Care and Education Programs. Specifically, in 2018 the Planni ng Council will advocate to : Support legislative efforts to s upport successful implementatio n of the AB 833 pilot, scaling policies covered in the pilot to the bay area region and across the State. PAGE | 54 Alameda County State Legislative Priorities 2018 Significantly expand ECE funding, access and services for all i ncome eligible children and families with special focus on: equity; meeting the needs of infants and toddlers; an d vulnerable children and families, including: immigrants, those experiencing homelessness, children with spec ial needs, or families connected to the Child Welfare system; eradicating raci al disparities and structural, policy and institutional barriers and eliminating child care deserts. Access Protect and increase child care access for immigrant, homeless and foster care families and children in poverty. Promote utilization of CalWORKs child care including through si mplified eligibility, increased service navigation, and coordination. Continue to increase Standard Rei mbursement and Regional Market Rates. Streamline and create efficiencies such as coordinated regulato ry, contracting and reimbursement processes within the current federal, state and local programs. Integrate child care in County place based strategies that conc entrate resources and investments in communities with the highest level of need. Retain and protect 21st Century Learning Center funding. Restore the Centralized Eligibility List (CEL). Restore the Alternative Paymen t agency support services rate. Advocate for 24 month eligibility redetermination for all child care subsidies. Quality/Health, Safety and Environmental Health Continue to improve quality in early care and education, includ ing addressing facilities, health, safety and environmental health, workforce wages and professional developm ent and Quality Rating and Improvement System funding. Increase timely inspections and frequency of Community Care Lic ensing visits to annual visits (aligns with County Social Services Agency). Quality/Workforce Increase ECE professional development including, but not limite d to: dedicated paid days for training; increased workforce compensation and benefits to reflect the pr ofessional work of the field; education, succession planning, and career pathways. Quality/Support Services Increase mental health resources and connections with ECE progr ams. Increase funding for navigators ( including at Resource and Refe rral agencies) for vu lnerable families. Increase funding for Local Planni ng Councils and preserve local flexibility. ALAMEDA COUNTY INTERAGENCY CHILDREN'S POLICY COUNCIL The Alameda County Interagency Children's Policy Council (ICPC) engages in crosssystem collaboration by improving interagency communication, developing childfriendly policies and practices, and initiating systems changes that result in healthy, safe, and thriving children and youth throughout Alameda County. Comprised of County department directors and leaders, ICPC provides advocacy and leadership to improve and enhance service delivery and outcomes for children and youth. Our priorities fo r legislative advocacy are guided by a set of overarching principles that emphasize equity, upstream investme nt, and interagency collaboration. ICPC supports legislative actions that: Prioritize the health and wellbeing of children, youth, and fam ilies, regardless of immigration or housing status PAGE | 55 Alameda County State Legislative Priorities 2018 Recognize and mitigate systemi c inequities in public systems; Support evidencebased policies a nd programs to ensure healthy, educated children, stable families, and safe and supportive communities. Bolster, enhance, and innovate saf ety net programs that serve o ur most vulnerable populations; Recognize wealth inequality and provide equitable access to eco nomic opportunity and selfsufficiency for all Alameda County residents; Remove barriers to pub lic and private inter agency collaboration ; and Preserve and increase funding st reams dedicated to upstream and preventative investments in children and youth. Our vision for healthy, safe, and thriving children, youth, and families includes ensuring the following priorities are addressed. ICPC advocates for policy change and legislative act ion that increases equita ble outcomes across the following domains: Healthy Ensure all children are born healthy; Give parents adequate support th ey need to care f or young child ren; Support consistent access to qua lity medical, dental, and behav ioral health care; Support prevention of childhood o besity and increase overall fa mily health; Ensure access to safe spaces for physical activity within their own communities; and Ensure access to quality nutritious foods and guarantee access to safe drinking water in schools and communities. Safe Strengthen all families to ensure all children and youth live i n safe and stable environments; Ensure safe, affordable housing for all families with children and youth, and unaccompanied transitional age youth; Prioritize prevention, diversion, and restorative justice pract ices that impede youth involvement in juvenile justice systems; Guarantee freedom from mistreatment, abuse, neglect, and violen ce; and Address and mitigate t he impacts of trauma on children, youth, and families. Thriving Ensure all families have the ability to meet basic needs- nutri tious food, shelter, clothing, health care, and accessible transportation; Guarantee that all children have equitable access to a quality education and opportunities that promote success in life and future careers; Ensure children have the right t o a voice and representation in matters that affect them; and Support and sustain programs promoting healthy developmen t and care coordination for families and children. HEALTH HEALTH CARE ACCESS, QUA LITY, AND AFFORDABILITY All key provisions of the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordabl e Care Act (ACA) were in p lace as of January 2014, and the legislation has been su ccessful in reducing the rates o f uninsured in the nation. According to the US Census Bureau, the rate of U.S. residents who were uninsured fe ll from 13.3 percent in 2013 to 10.4 percent in 2014; in California, the rate of uninsured fell from 17.2 pe rcent in 2013 to 12.4 percent in 2014, a decline of almost 5 percentage points. In the County, the rate of uninsure d fell from 12.6 percent in 2013 to 8.2 percent PAGE | 56 Alameda County State Legislative Priorities 2018 in 2014. In 2016, the uninsured r ate in Alameda County fell to 4.2 percent. Despite this dramatic drop in the uninsured rate, 68,648 residents still lack access to health ca re coverage. The County embraces the \"Triple Aim:\" improving patient experie nce, satisfaction and quality, the health of populations, and costeffectivene ss. For health care reform to further succeed, we must maximize eligibility, enrollment and retention in health insurance and access to appr opriate and high quality health care. Special attention should be paid to policies that: Increase access to health insurance. Simplify the health insurance application process for all, espe cially hard toreach and underserved populat ions. Support legislation that would streamline enrollment and retention for MediCal. Increase access to health care. The County supports legislation that provides lower cost and mo re accessible treatment alternatives in communi ty settings; promotes efficien cy; incentivizes physicians to go into primary care; incentivizes expanded medi cal staffing, including use of advancedpractice nurses where there are physician shortages and the use of a wider range of healthcare team members, such as community health workers. The County supports legi slation that preserves and inc reases funding for community health centers in order to meet the increased demand for health center services a mong the ACA's Medicaid Coverage Expansion population. E x p a n d d e n t a l c a r e a c c e s s a n d p r e v e n t i v e s e r v i c e s f o r l o w i n c o m e Californians. Dental health is a preventive disease, an integral part of overall health and can have impacts on children's growth, development, selfesteem, and learning. The County supports policies that wo uld increase prevention services and new more efficient models of care, such a s the virtual dental home and e xpanded dental teams. Ensure linguistically and culturally appropriate communication with patients . The County supports legislation that encourages use of appropriate written material s from insurance companies, providers and pharmacy companies, and promotes standards and adequate trainin g for inperson communication at the point of care. Support statewide comprehensive health care for undocumented p ersons. Expand health care access and coverage for undocumented individuals and families and the expa nsion of MediCal and Covered California to cover the remaining uninsured. Promote payment reform that increases the ability to provide pr eventive services and establishes risk s h a r i n g b e t w e e n h o s p i t a l s a n d p r i m a r y c a r e . Support payment reform that incentivizes positive health outcomes, not just the ability to bill for more tests or visits . It should promote health education and allow sameday visits for better integrated care, and enable doctors to spend more time with patients at the initial visit to improve the quality of overall care. Ensure maintenance and enhancem ent of the safety net system. Increase provider rates; improve transitions of care (e.g. from ac ute or specialty care to prima ry care medical homes); an d support policies that provide coverage to those with p arttime or temporary employmen t. Use the opportunities provided by the 1115 MediCal 2020 Waiver to enhanc e integration and effectiven ess of the safety net healthcare system. Support adequate Per Member Per Mo nth (PMPM) payments for healt h home services and the new Health Home Program under Afford able Care Act Section 2703. Support Whole Person Care Pilot and other similar efforts : Enhance integration of mental health and substance use treatment, primary care, and social services to c reate seamless care and support of social determinants of health for patients. This may include supportin g capacity to appropriately share data across systems in order to improve coordination and efficiency of care ; and payment reforms, e.g. ability to bill for behavioral health visits that o ccur on the same day as primary care visits. Support policies that enable systems and providers to reduce he alth inequities . As an example, the County supports infrastructure for the c ollection, analysis, and utili zation of race, language, and ethnicity and disability data in monitoring and planning to reduce or eliminate disparit ies. As our systems shift to population health, the County supports efforts to dev elop metrics and collect data on the social determinants of health. PAGE | 57 Alameda County State Legislative Priorities 2018 Support improved treatment of chronic pain while reducing inapp ropriate prescription of opioids and their unsafe storage and disposal. For example, support coverage for and access to acupuncture, ph ysical therapy, and other nonpharmaceutical interventions to treat chronic pai n and opioid addiction, and reduce barriers to opioid medication collection sites. MEDICAL AND HEALTH CARE REFORM The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA) al lowed states to expand Medicaid (MediCal in California). MediCal is California's health insurance program for eligible lowincome individuals and families. Beginning in January 2014, MediCal was expanded to include inc omeeligible childless, nondisabled, adults. Enrollment locally and across the State exceeded all prediction s and onethird of California residents are currently receiving MediCal. Alameda County supports efforts to leverage health care reform to enroll children, individuals, and families in the full range of benefits for which they are e ligible. For more information on public benefits (CalFresh and CalWORKs), please s ee the Human Services Chapter. Sustain and strengthen MediCal funding. MediCal insures working families, as well as the most vulnerab le individuals. Without necessary f unding many families and indivi d u a l s c o u l d l o s e a c c e s s t o h e a l t h c a r e , jeopardizing their wellbeing, and the health of the larger com munity. Alameda County opposes any policies and efforts to cut funding, reduce current program benefits, or restrict eligibility to the MediCal program. Eliminate the asset test for A L L M e d i C a l c a t e g o r i e s . With the MediCal expansion, the newly eligible population does not have an asset test. However, other populati ons receiving (NonModified Adjusted Gross Income) MediCal still have resource limits Asset limits are a disincentive to save and Alameda County supports the elimination of these tests f or all categories of MediCal. Support the protection of and expansion of MediCal. S upport the protection of and expansion of MediCal for individuals who do not have a ccess to insurance, especially families, children, and individuals with pre existing health conditions. Preserve and fully restore funding for DentiCal. Good dental hygiene is crucial to overall health and can have impacts on job prospects and selfesteem. Support the part ial restoration of adult dental MediCal benefits (DentiCal) that began in May 2014 and a full restorat ion of 2009 funding levels. Untreated oral infections complicate medical conditions and are often a source of increased medical costs. Restore MediCal optional benefits. Optional benefits (including Audiology, Chiropractic, Incontine nce Cream and Washes, Optician/Optical Lab, Podiatry, and Speech Th erapy) were cut in 2009 in response to the State fiscal crisis. The acupunc ture benefit was restored start ing in July 2016. Restoring the other benefits would increase services for MediCal recipients and broaden the care they can receive under the program, increasing their overall health and wellbeing. Protect and strengthen LongTerm Home and Community Based Servi ces. Support MediCal funding which provides services to individuals with disabilities such as long term home and communi tybased services, physical and speech therapy to children with disabilities, and services to individuals with chronic illness and disabilities. Increase MediCal provider reimbursement rates. California has some of the lowest provider reimbursement rates in the country and recent rate cuts raise c oncerns about consumer access at a time when millions of new individuals are enrolled in MediCal. Support i ncreases in MediCal reimbursement rates and policies that make it easier to claim reimbursements. Provide adequate funding for MediCal Administration. MediCal caseloads have increased significantly since health care reform (a nearly 90 percent increase in Alame da County since 2014). Me diCal administration funding for counties needs to be sufficient to handle increased w o r k l o a d s a n d m e e t c a s e m a n a g e m e n t standards. Increase the MediCal Aged and Disabled (A&D) income disregards . The income disregards for the MediCal A&D program (which provides free, comprehensive coverage to per sons over the age of 65 and those with disabilities) have not increased since the program began in 200 1. This has resulted in eligibility decreasing from PAGE | 58 Alameda County State Legislative Priorities 2018 13 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL) to 123 percent. S upport increasing the MediCal A&D income limit to 138 percent FPL to align the A&D program with income limits under the MediCal expansion and reduce the number of seniors paying a large share of cost before MediCal will cover services. CALIFORNIA CHILDREN'S SERVICES Started in 1927, CCS is the oldest public health program in Cal ifornia. CCS provides ca se management and care coordination to 180,000 (6,500 in Alameda County) clients, birt h to 21, who have serious injuries or chronic, disabling and/or life threatening medical conditions such as ca ncer, spina bifida, cerebral palsy and sickle cell disease. The CCS program also sets standards for pediatric spec ialty care in the State of California, panels physicians, certifies clinical Special Care Centers, neonatal a nd pediatric intensive care units, and hospitals that provide specialized pediatric medical and surgical services. Effective July 2018, medical case management and responsibility to issue payment for clinical services for CCS program clients will become the responsibility of MediCal Mana ged Care Plans in 21 counties (not Alameda). This change is called 'Whole Child Model'. There are significant con cerns about the potential negative impact of this change on clients and their families, because of the lack of re levant experience and clinical staffing in MediCal Managed Care Plans. Support continued funding for California Children's Services as a system of care in the remaining counties. Support legislation that will maintain and strengthen CCS as pe diatric system of care for children/youth with serious injuries and medically complex conditions. CCS provides a robust regionalized architecture for pediatric specialty care anchored by centers of excellence consisting of C C S c e r t i f i e d r e g i o n a l h o s p i t a l s a n d m u l t i disciplinary Special Care Centers. CCS also establishes and enf orces statewide standards for provider participation that underlie the s tatewide system of quality ped iatric care for all children in California. Support legislation that maintains CCS program standards and qu ality case management in whole child model counties and in the remaining counties. Key components include: maintenance of a statewide network of approved physicians and other health care providers, hospita ls, and Special Care Centers that can be accessed by any CCSenrolled child regardless of the child's pl ace of residence and that set the pediatric standard of care for all children in the state; referral to the appropriate pediatric subspecialists, hospitals and Special Care Centers with the expertise to care for each indivi dual child's specific conditions; and provision of case management, service authorizations and care coordination b y professionals with spe cific expertise in the care of children with sp ecial health care needs. Support legislation that will ensure all changes to CCS proceed slowly, carefully and with great deliberation, ensuring rigorous independent evaluation of all e lements of CCS redesign. Any evaluation of CCS redesign should assess access to services, family/provider satisfaction, clinical and process outcomes, and cost savings. Surveys conducted by the Department of Health Car e Services demonstrate that CCS families are overwhelmingly satisfied with the services they currently recei ve from CCS, with satisfaction higher than what is typically found for managed c are plans (89 percent of parent s reported being very satisfied or satisfied with case management services). Making changes to CCS too quick ly or without adequate, independent data evaluating proposed changes coul d adversely affect CCS children /youth. Support full funding of all medically necessary medications, in cluding nonformulary and compounded medications and dietary supplements. Pharmacies need to be paid to provide all medically ne cessary pharmaceuticals to CCS children . Support legislation to improve the ability of all Medi Cal pharmacies (children's hospital pharmacies, small neighborhood pharma cies, and big chain pharmacies) to provide medically necessary nonformulary medications, dietary suppleme nts, and compounded medications to CCS children. PAGE | 59 Alameda County State Legislative Priorities 2018 BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES Behavioral health problems (mental health and/or substance use disorders) are significant public health problems impacting millions, and are associated with other chronic disea ses that often result in morbidity and mortality. The effects of mental illness can range from minor disruptions in daily functioning to incapacitating personal, social, and occupational impai rments and premature death. Support for the following items will enable the County in provi ding a fiscally sound, comprehensive continuum of behavioral health rangi ng from prevention/early interv ention, treatment and recovery/support that will foster increased access to services, a reduction in mental heal th stigma and discrimination and improved health outcomes for Alameda County resi dents with behavioral health co nditions: Protect and Increase funding to expand services specifically fo r older adults with mental health and co occurring substance abuse issues. Mental health problems are not a normal part of the aging proce ss. Mental illness and substance use disorders are major impediments to li ving well in old age, cause considerable personal suffering and make it difficult for older people to achieve the ir potential. Older adults who become disabled by mental illness deserve the sa me guarantee of care already ex tended to those who face other kinds of disabilities. Protect and Increase funding to build a competent geriatric beh avioral health workforce to meet the demands of the rapidly aging population. The unique characteristics of geriatric mental health and subst ance use treatment create important r equirements for workforce compe tencies, and includes the ability to detect possible mental health and substance use conditions in older ad ults who may have coexisting physical health conditions as well as other cogni tive and functional impairment s. Protect and Expand the 1915(i) Sta te Plan Amendment to include the evidencebased Individual Placement and Support (IPS) employment services as a billable rehabilitat ion service under MediCal. Research shows that 6070 percent of adults with psychiatric disabilities woul d like to be employed. This evidenced based practice should be a standard of care to support clients in bec oming employed; which can assist with breaking the cycle of poverty. Expansion of the 1915(i) State Plan Amend ment by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to include IPS as a billable service will allow Alameda County to participate in federal cost sharing and will support system clients to access a better qual ity of life, to enjoy increased independence and to experience fewer hospitalizations. Protect and Expand permanent supportive housing for individuals who are homeless and/or disabled . Multiple research studies and policy papers articulate the bene fits of expanding permanent supportive housing (affordable housing coupled with appropriate supportive service s) for homeless individuals and individuals with disabilities. California lags beh ind other states that have dev eloped ongoing statewide commitments to further the creation of permanent supportive housing. The Department of Health Care Services should allow health plans to develop innovative approaches to meet the housing need s of their clients and should play a leading role in advocating for the expansion of affordable housing reso urces at the state a nd federal level. End the MediCal lock out of reimbursable mental health and sub stance use disorder treatment services for youth and adults who are incarcerated. 50 percent or more of state prisoners meet the criteria for a diagnosis of drug abuse or dependence, but only 10 percent rece ive medicallybased drug treatment. Among youth, as many as four out of fi ve teens in the juvenile justic e system have drug or alcohol problems, yet fewer than 20 percent have access to substance abuse treatment programs. Additionally, more than 8 in 10 formally incarcerated individuals have chronic physical, mental , or substance abuse disorders that create significant, distinct reentry challenges and service needs. Med iCal reimbursable treatment services to incarcerated individuals in both juvenile and adult prison syst ems have the potential to yield substantial health and economic benefits. Advocate for the reduction of individuals with mental illness a nd cooccurring substance use disorders incarcerated in county jails. More than 2 million adults with serious mental illnesses are ad mitted to county jails nationally each year. Once incarcerated, people with ment al illnesses tend to stay longer in jail and are at a higher risk of reincarceration than individuals without t hese illnesses. Reducing the number of mentally ill in the criminal justice syste m by providing responsible alt ernatives can save money, reduce recidivism, improve public safety and provide better outcomes for the offen ders. PAGE | 60 Alameda County State Legislative Priorities 2018 Promote increased education and enforcement of the Paul Wellsto ne and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 (MHPAEA or \"parity\"). MHPAEA is a federal law requiring that if certain health plans provide coverage for mental health or substance us e disorder services, they must provide services in a manner comparable to coverage provided for medical and sur gical care. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration ( SAMHSA) has identified five pri mary components that are critical for successful i m p l e m e n t a t i o n a n d m o n i t o r i n g o f p a r i t y : ( 1 ) o p e n c h a n n e l s o f c ommunication, (2) standardization of materials, (3) creation of templ ates, workbooks and other tools , (4) implementation of market conduct exams and network adequacy assessments, and (5) collaboration with mu ltiple agencies and stakeholder groups. These five approaches, when impl emented in a coordinated manner , can help ensure parity for all Californians. Support the development and implementation of a statewide peer and family support specialist certification program as a part of the state's comprehensive me ntal health delivery system. Peer specialist services include but are not limited to: wellness, resilience a nd recovery coaching; navigating systems and community services; assisting in the development of individual wellness plans; and outreach to potential beneficiaries. Peer specialists h ave been shown to be more effe ctive than traditional p roviders in reaching populations that are historically underserved by the health car e system. Peer services also assist to expand and diversify the health care workfo rce, mainly the nonphysician w orkforce, which is an area of particular focus for the California State Department of Health Care Services. REDUCING INEQUITIES IN HUMAN I MMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS (HIV) In 1998, Alameda County institut ed a State of Emergency due to the disproportionate impact of HIV among African Americans. Approximately 40 percent of all HIV infections in th e County occur in this group, yet African Americans comprise only 11.6 percent of the population. HIV als o disproportionately impacts Latinos and men who have sex with men in the County. Although overall rates of HIV in women are lower, they are even more concentrated in African American women than in other women. It i s t h e g o a l o f t h e C o u n t y t o s t o p t h e transmission of HIV, improve HIV treatment outcomes and combat HIVrelated health dis parities. Biomedical interventions to prevent and treat HIV are now wellestablished and should be implemented in coordination with harm reduction efforts, wraparound services, and traditional p revention (especially education and condom distribution) in order to meet the County goal. This can best b e accomplished by supporting legislation and policy that facilitates access to testing, treatment, PrEP/PEP, and re lated services for all impacted populations while at the same time reducing stigma. Support Funding for HIV Prevention and Care: Increase funding for HIV prevention and care. Powerful tools exist for preventing, diagnosing and treating HIV. Increased fu nding will lead to increased access to and more effective use of these tools in impacted communities. Support funding for housing and other supportive services: Alameda County residents infected with or at risk of contracting HIV cannot consistently access HIVrelated services without also addressing basic needs such as food and shelter. Supporting funding to meet these needs for populations affected by HIV is essential to reduce the impact of HIV in the County. Decriminalize HIV infection . Modify or remove exi sting laws that create and enhance crimin al penalties for p e o p l e l i v i n g w i t h H I V . T h e s e l a w s a r e b a s e d o n i r r a t i o n a l f e a r s and they undermine public health by perpetuating stigma and disincentivizing HIV testing and care. HIV criminalization laws also disproportionately impact women and people of color. Support Harm Reduction Services: Syringe exchanges were among the first biomedical tools that ef fectively prevented the transmission of HI V and Hepatitis C among injecti on drug users. Successful implementation of syringe exchanges has helped keep HIV rates due to injection dr ug use low in Alameda County and helped injection drug users access testing, overdose prevention and tr eatment as well as disposal of used syringes and other associated hazardous waste . The County supports harm redu ction programs including syringe exchange and supervised consumption sites that reduce the chance for HIV transmission, prevent overdose deaths, and increase access to HIV and substance use treatment. PAGE | 61 Alameda County State Legislative Priorities 2018 Facilitate HIV Testing: Support the easing of restrictions on who can perform HIV Rapid Testing. Currently, only licensed medical practitioners and Statetrained HIV test counselors are allowed to administer HIV rapid pointofcare tests in Californi a. California is one of the onl y states with this restriction, severely limiting state wide HIV testing efforts ALCOHOL PREVENTION Current law and regulation provide valuable tools that can be u sed to develop strategies for changing many high risk environments in which alcohol and other drugs are used. Th is \"environmental\" approach to Alcohol and other drug prevention focuses on changes in laws, public policies and social norms to reduce and prevent problems related to the use of alcohol an d other drugs. The principles n oted below, when applied through actual legislative changes, will enhance the ability of concerned community and ne ighborhood groups to reduce and prevent alcohol and other drug related problems. Reduce the social availability of alcohol to youth: Currently underage youth c an easily access alcohol through social sources, including parents, older siblings, or t een parties, which must be reduced or eliminated. Social host liability laws can hold adults, who served alcohol to underage youth, accountable for injuries that occur as a result of underage drinking. Stop targeting of youth for alcohol advertising: It is currently very difficult for parents and other adults to control a youth's exposure to al cohol advertising, marketing, a nd promotions, which frequently associate alcohol use with success, attrac tiveness, and popularity. Strat egies for addressing this problem may include: Limiting the sponsorship of comm unity events by the alcohol ind ustry, tightening sectio n 25664, the advertising t o m i n o r s s e c t i o n o f t h e A l c o h o l B e v e r a g e C o n t r o l c o d e , a n d s u p porting enforcement of existing local advertising regulations that con trol the placement and display of advertising. Reduce the availability of alcohol products targeted to youth m arket: Alcohol products such as flavored malt beverages (alcopops), with their colorful packaging and fr uity sweet flavors, are targeted to underage youth, particularly young girls. Marketing the products as \"mal t\" beverages (beer), despite their being primarily distilled spirits, has allowed them to be taxed at a significan tly lower rate, advertis ed on TV, and sold in convenience stores, small markets and other \"beer and wine\" sto res. Renew efforts to deter alcoholimpaired driving : In 2014, there were 9,967 fata lities in motor vehicle traffic crashes involving a driver with a BAC of .08 g/dL or higher; th is was 31 percent of total traffic fatalities for the year. An average of 1 alcoholimpaired driving fatality occurr ed every 53 minutes in 2014. ( 2014 Data: Alcohol Impaired Driving CrashStats NHTSA .) An average drunk driver has driven drunk 80 times before fir st arrest. (Centers for Disease Control .) \"Vital Signs: AlcoholImpaire d Driving Among Adults \u2014 United States, 2010.\" Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. October 4, 2011.) Adults drank too much and got behind the wheel during 2012, an estimated 4.2 million U.S. adults reported driv ing while impaired by alcohol at least once in the preceding 30 days, resulting in an estimated 121 million alcoho limpaired driving episodes annually, and a national rate of 505 episodes per 1,000 population. (Morbidity and Mortality Weekly, August 7, 2015) Strategies to deter alcoholimpaired driving include lowering the legal bloodalcohol levels, prompt suspension of a driver's license for people arrested, expanded sobriety ch eckpoints, alcoholignition interlock programs, and sustained health education th at includes efforts to reduce binge drinking. Reduce the overconcentration of alcohol sales establishments in neighborhoods . A high concentration of retail alcohol licenses in communities is considered a risk fac tor for youth growing up in that environment. Public health research has consistently linked high crime and v iolence rates to high concentrations of alcohol licenses. Although most regulation of the siting of new alcohol retailers is at the local level, there are state policies that can impact overconcentration. These policies, in clude increased resources for sustained enforcement of regulations and limiting the active status of al cohol permits to 10 years Support alcohol taxes to pay for public health and safety costs , reducing alcohol harms and underage drinking. Alcohol taxes have not been raised in California since 1992 whe n the tax was increased by a penny per drink. Since that time, the real value of alcohol taxes in California has decreased 45 percent due to rising inflation. Raising alcohol taxe s has been shown to be a highly effective tool in reducing a wide range of harm PAGE | 62 Alameda County State Legislative Priorities 2018 and consequences among all age g roups. Such harms include alcoh ol dependence, liver cirrhosis, risky sexual behaviors leading to STDs, traffic fatalities, and especially u nderage drinking. REDUCING INEQUITIES IN CHRONIC DISEASES In Alameda County the four leading causes of death: cancer, hea rt disease, stroke, and chronic lower R e s p i r a t o r y D i s e a s e , a r e d u e t o c h r o n i c d i s e a s e s a n d a c c o u n t f o r 57 percent of all deaths. Diabetes and Hypertension account for another 5.7 percent of deaths. Despite i n c r e a s e i n l i f e e x p e c t a n c y a m o n g a l l racial/ethnic groups, there has been a growing disparity in lif e expectancy. For example in 1960 African Americans in Alameda County had a life expectancy 4.0 years les s than Caucasians and in 2010 despite marked increases in both racial/ethnic groups the disparity had increa sed to 6.5 years. Support chronic disease screening, detection, education and car e management system Chronic diseases disproportionally affect people o f color. Poor screening, acces s to care, and the lack of understanding of how to manage these diseases leads to complications and premature deat h. The County supports expanding and enforcing a chronic disease system of care that includes the pa yment and provision of making self management education accessible t o people with chronic disease to manage their disease. Enforce standardsbased physical education in public schools as mandated in the Ed Code - Students must be instructed by a credentialed physical education specialist i n grades 16, for 200 minutes every 10 days, and in grades 712, for 400 minutes every 10 days. Less than 30 per cent of all County students in grades 5, 7, and 9 can pass 5 out of 6 of the re quired areas of the California F itness test. Promote the initiation and prolonged duration of breastfeeding - Breastfeeding has been proven to provide a broad range of health benefits to both baby and mother includ ing reducing a child's chance of becoming overweight or obese. Encouraging and supporting breastfeeding, and enforcing laws that protect lowwage workers, allow family leave, foster child bonding, and create b reastfeedingfriendly work places will lay a foundation of good health. Limit the marketing of junk food to children - The Institute of Medicine recently issued a comprehensive lis t of recommendations to combat the obesity crisis, including the creation of guidelines to limit the marketing of junk food to children. In recent years this marketing has incre ased greatly, particularly concentrated in low income communities, leading to an increase in childhood obesity and its associated diseases. Expand the availability of healthful foods and beverages, and d ecrease the availability of unhealthful foods and beverages . Healthful and nutritious foods and beverages must be made mor e easily available in low income neighborhoods paired wi th a decrease in access to unheal thful foods and beverages. The State's pilot program to increase access to healthful foods should be expande d and greater financial incentives and/or assistance should be provided to retailers to implement the cha nges. Decrease the availability of unhealthful beverages through a su gar sweetened beverage/\"soda\" tax or fee . In the County, approximately 60 percent of adolescents and 31 p ercent of children consume one or more sodas per day. Greater consumption of sugar sweetened beverages is associated with dental caries, diabetes, overweight, and obesity among both adults and children. A soda tax or fee would gain broader support when funds raised are reinvested in th e communities most disproporti onately affected by the obesity epidemic. Improve utilization of food assistance programs - The complexity of applying for and maintaining eligibility for food assistance programs is frequently a barrier to lowinc ome families. Streamlining the application for nutrition programs CalFresh (formerly Food Stamps), Women, In fants and Children (WIC), and School Meals Program (Breakfast/Lunch) would g reatly increase the numbers of children served. Reduce smoking, limit secondhand s moke exposure, decrease youth access to tobacco products and marketing, and promote health equity among California's diverse populations: The County supports provisions that 1) protect individuals from secondhand smoke ex posure, 2) strengthen laws to reduce youth access to tobacco products, 3) counter protobacco influences i ncluding advertising and media images or content especially to youth, 4) reduce or eliminate the retaili ng of new tobacco or nicotine products, 5) promote tobacco cessation, 6) Inc orporate health equity, langua ge access, and cultural competency standards PAGE | 63 Alameda County State Legislative Priorities 2018 in all tobacco control agencies, programs, processes, and pract ices, 7) Increase support to priority populations' advocacy and leadership alliances in tobacco control, 8) Streng then the capacity of agency and institution personnel to achieve tobaccorelated health equity, and 9) Cond uct monitoring, surveillance, evaluation, and research; disseminate findings to reduce tobaccorelated health disparities and measure progress toward achieving health equity and social justice. Create \"AsthmaFriendly\" communities: The County supports policies that create \"AsthmaFriendly\" communities, especially those tha t eliminate the disproportiona te burden of asthma for people living in poverty and communities of color. This goal can be achieved thr ough optimizing the diagnosis, treatment, and management of asthma by adherence to the current National Heart L u n g a n d B l o o d I n s t i t u t e ' s a s t h m a guidelines; expanding the reach of proven case management progr ams for serving pers ons with asthma; utilizing community health workers and trained professionals; i mproving air quality reducing diesel emissions in our communities, and improving housing conditions to meet th e s t a n d a r d s o f a h e a l t h y h o m e w h i l e holding those responsible for th e conditions to a legal standar d. HEALTH AND WELLBEING OF WOMEN , CHILDREN, YOUTH AND FAMILIES Many more women, children, youth and families now have access t o quality medical care, thanks to years of education efforts, provider outreach, advances in medical techn ology, and the Affordable Care Act. It is critical that these gains not be reversed. Access to medical care is imp ortant and has likely contributed to improvement in some maternal and child health outcomes - infant mortality, for example, has been declining steadily over the last two decades. However, low birth weight rate, a key maternal and child health indicator, has not budged over the last ten years two and remains a bove the Healthy People 2020 be nchmark. There are deep inequities in maternal and child health by race: infant mortality rates among African Americans are two to four times higher than whites and AfricanAmerican women are three to four times more likely to die from pregnancyrelated causes than white women. Additionally women now face challenges to their reproduc tive freedom in a way that we have not seen since the initial debates that led to the passage of Roe v Wade in 1973. Ensuring access t o comprehensive, low cost, reproductive, prenatal and primary care - including famil y planning and abortion services, and case management where appropriate - will continue to be important as will program and policy efforts that attempt to remedy the impact of neighborhoo d and social conditions on the health of women, their children, their partners and their families, thereby secur ing the health and wellbeing o f current and future generations. Support access to comprehensive, low cost and readily accessibl e reproductive health services, including family planning, emergency contraception and abortion services. Special attention should be paid to policies that 1) do not limit the range o f options available and 2) ensu re access to accurate, unbi ased information about reproductive and sexual health for youth and adults. Policy cha nges that have expanded access to health care for women and men of reproductive age must be maintained. Support efforts to explore innovative statelevel financing mec hanisms for home visiting. Other states, such as Minnesota, have MOUs between Public Health Departments and Medicaid managed care organizations (MMCO) stipulating that home visi ting services be directly bill ed to the MMCO. In other states, partnerships between Public Health, Health Care Services and Social Services agencies at the state level have resulted in braided funding mechanisms that sustain local home visiting pro grams not supported by MIECHV, Healthy Start or other federal funds. California should explore similar funding ideas that could result in evidence based home visiting programs becoming a permanent part of the e arly childhood landscape of services for low income women, children, fathers and families. Support continued full implementation of the Comprehensive Peri natal Services Program (CPSP) for all MediCal eligible women , regardless of whether they are feeforservice clients or are enrolled in MediCal managed care, as well as for women who are newly eligible for c overage under the ACA. CPSP provides low income MediCal eligible women with comprehensive nutrition, ps ychosocial and health education assessments, interventions and support throughout the prenatal and postpartum period, in addition to high quality prenatal care. CPSP is a vital component of the effort to ensure that lowincome women get the support and care they need during their pregnancies. PAGE | 64 Alameda County State Legislative Priorities 2018 Support policies and legislation that promote comprehensive sex education and HIV/AIDS prevention instruction in schools that is ageappropriate and emphasizes a bstinence, in compliance with the California Comprehensive Sexual Health and HIV/AIDS Prevention Education A ct and the No Child Left Behind Act. Ensure that California continues to emphasize abstinence within the context of HIV/AIDS prevention education (EC 51934 (3) of the Comprehensive Se xual Health Act) but reinforce that Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs), unplanned pregnancies, H uman Immunodeficiency Virus (HI V) infection and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) all pose public health risks and you th have the right to know the different methods of transmission and protection and how they can protect themselves. Partnerships between public health departments and schools have been successful in educatin g and empowering youth on these subjects and should continue to be emphasized. Support efforts to ensure safe, s table and affordable housing f or pregnant women and families with young children. Pregnancy, infancy and early childhood are critical periods whe re adverse social conditions can have a disproportionate effect on health and development. Living in su bstandard housing, experiencing neighborhood violence or being homeless for even short periods of time durin g the early stages of life can expose young children and their families to dangerous levels of toxic stress , resulting in potential damage to their longterm health, wellbeing and overall life trajectory. Support funding for the equitable inclusion of services for men in local family support systems of care . For decades publicly funded family support systems of care have pro vided services to ensure the health and well being of women and children. Federal and State funding is neede d to address the health and wellbeing of men and assure their inclusion in family support programming so tha t they can successfully engage with their families and children. This funding should be directed towards programs, agencies, and organizations that are open to and inclusive of the needs of men and that provide fath erspecific services and activities that further the goal of increasing fathers' involvement in their children's lives. Additionally, the County supports legislation to ensure full access to physical and mental health services fo r men, particularly for men reentering the community from the local cr iminal justice systems. EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES In 1980, the Legislature enacted the Emergen cy Medical Services (EMS) Act, which empowers counties to establish Local EMS Agencies (LEMSAs) to develop and implement EMS system s. (Health & Safety Code, \u00a7 1797.200.) The formation of LEMSAs was and continues to be needed to oversee t he varying special interests of both public and private providers, hospitals, and tertiary resources to ensure a coordinated systems approach to the delivery of emergency medical services for the people of California in thei r most vulnerable moments. As specified in the EMS Act LEMSAs are empowered to create an EMS system to provide for a \"specially organized arrangement\" involving \"personnel, facilities, and equipment for the effective and coo rdinated delivery\" of EMS in \"emergency conditions.\" (Id., \u00a7 1797.78.) Ensure funding for emergency medical services continuity. Ensure the continuation of LEMSA authority for planning, implementing and evaluating local EMS systems. Under current law, counties have an obligation to ensure public health, and access to emergency medical care, inc luding ambulance services. EMS and ambulance services planned for and provided on a countywide ba sis ensure system integr ity and the delivery of optimal patient care. Our goal is to maintain and improve th e EMS system that delivers optimal patient care and efficient system design for the County overall and avoid fr agmentation. Secure funding to support emergency medical services in hospita ls. Over 50 percent of hospital emergency rooms operate at a net operating loss due to the significant vo lume of uncompensated care. Legislative efforts, including an initiative to provide new dedicated fundi n g f o r u n c o m p e n s a t e d c a r e i n e m e r g e n c y rooms and specialty centers, are n e e d e d . F u n d i n g i s n e c e s s a r y t o support emergency medical services, specialty centers, trauma care, pediatric care, stroke centers and cardiac care centers. Hospitals throughout the State provide a significant volume of emergency care to pat ients who do not have thirdparty insurance coverage and the finan cial impact is often greater on hospitals located in urban areas. Increase revenue for amb ulance transportation. Ambulance transportation reimbursements in Alameda County have significant gaps, particularly in relation t o payments by MediCal and Medicare. MediCal PAGE | 65 Alameda County State Legislative Priorities 2018 reimbursement payments in particular fall drastically short, co vering just over 1/5 of the actual cost of service delivery. Legislative efforts are needed for new dedicated fund ing or for increases in reimbursement from MediCal and other insurers. Support legislation which promotes funding for the propagation of emergency medical community preparedness, response, and resiliency training programs which may include mental health initiatives. Programs needed are cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), basic first aid including hemorrhage control and those promoting enhanced mental health. DISASTER PREPAREDNESS Natural and humanmade disasters including the recent fires in California, earthquakes, acts of terrorism, projections of more frequent and severe extreme weather events and emerging communicable diseases demonstrate the need to ensure that Alameda County has a coordi nated system in place to respond to any hazard. Building the response capacity of public health, emergency medi cal services and health care systems includes planning for a \"surge\" of patients. The Public Health Departmen t and Emergency Medical Services (EMS) continue to work in collaboration with County, State and Federal agencie s, local health care providers and other institutions to strengthen our collaboration, communications and responsiven ess. The following will ens ure that our State and local disaster response systems are adequately prepared to resp ond in an emergency, prepared to respond to longterm health issues from disaster, and prepared to maintain continuity of operations: Support funding for regional communications. Regional planning must take place to develop communication s y s t e m s t h a t a r e f u n c t i o n a l i n a m u t u a l a i d r e s p o n s e s i t u a t i o n . Clear leadership provided by the State Department of Public Health and EMS Authority should promote im proved communication with the public and private sector. Funding is needed to support robust and redunda nt systems and enhance existing communications and information management systems. Develop systems for vulnerable populations. D e v e l o p a n d f u n d s y s t e m s t o e n s u r e t h a t s e r v i c e s a r e delivered in a timely and efficient manner to vulnerable popula tions with special consideration for children and adults with disabilities requirin g functional or access support services, as well as low income populations, seniors, children, individuals with language barriers and other specific needs. Preplanning for disaster response must be focused on those who are dependent on others such as ca retakers in the event of a largescale public health emergency. Secure funding for disaster preparedness, response and mitigati on. Support legislation that promotes funding for medical and health disaster planning, coordination, response and mitigation including infrastructure and emergency response personnel. SYSTEMS OF CARE FOR CHILDREN AND ADULTS WITH DISABILITIES Children and adults with disabilities in California rely on sys tems of care that have been chronically underfunded. The California economy is in its seventh year of recovery from the Great Recession, but the disability community has not shared in these economic gains. The need for full resto ration of essential safety net services should remain a priority. Disability status is almost a guarantee of s ignificant disparity in Alameda County: one in five people with a disability live in poverty versus one in ten peop le without a disability; the percentage of adults with l e s s t h a n a h i g h s c h o o l e d u c a t i o n i s o v e r t w i c e a s h i g h a m o n g p eople with disabilities than those without disabilities; only 22 percent of people with disabilities are e mployed compared to 67 percent of those without disabilities, and people with disabilities are more likely to e xperience a high housing cost burden compared to those without disabilities based on low and extremely low incom e status. An \"affordable rent\" for a single adult receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI) is less than $300/ month, but a typical studio apartment in Alameda County costs at least $1300/month. Alameda County supports policies that result in better outcomes for children and adults with disabilities, and the development of services designed for all our residents. Restora tion of funding, reinvestment in new services, and reform strategies are necessities to the stabilization of our c ompromised systems of care in order to provide a quality of life beyond institution alized poverty for children a nd adults with disabilities. PAGE | 66 Alameda County State Legislative Priorities 2018 Mandate Universal Developmental Screening with Incentives . Require the use of a high quality developmental screening tool in wellchild exams at 9, 18 and 2 430 months, and mandate a greater incentive, and higher relative value unit, in publicly funded insurance an d service programs. Fewer than one in three young children in California receive timely developmental scree nings. When pediatricians use developmental surveillance instead of a high quality screening tool, less tha n 30 percent of developmental delays are identified. This group of infant s and toddlers can make signifi cant developmental gains; 69 percent of at risk children who receive early intervention services require no spe cial education services by the time they start kindergarten. Universal developmental screening greatly improve s the rate of identification of developmental delays, boosts ch ild success and reduces health a nd educational system costs. Increase Funding and Reform Regional Center Funding Structure . R e g i o n a l C e n t e r s p r o v i d e o u t r e a c h , community education, intake and assessment, eligibility determi nation, resource development, and ongoing case management services for individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Support legislation that stabilizes community service providers and Regional Center operations in order to reform provider service rates and Regional Center operations to ensure funding levels a re adequate and sustainable, and provide annual increases while further re form strategies are developed and implemented. Significant impending systemic changes, including the federal ruling to prohibit fede ral reimbursement for services provided in segregated settings, the closure of the Sonoma Developmental Ce nter, and the need for the development of new programs and services for th e rising population of individu als with autism will place additional pressure on a system characterized in the 2015 Association of Regional Cent er Agencies report as \"On the Brink of Collapse.\" Create affordable and accessible housing. Support legislation and budget priorities that create affordabl e, accessible and integrated housing options and rental subsidy pr ograms for people at the lowest income levels. The need for housing that accommo dates a wide range of disabili ties is increasing due to community living options replacing costly and unj ust institutionalization, many veterans returning with disabilities, the high rate of homelessness among people with disabilities, and an aging po pulation. The average rent for a studio apartment in Alameda County is $1,380, while the maximum S upplemental Security Income/State Supplemental Payment (SSI/SSP) is below $900 a month. Support State wide h ousing plans that lead to an increase in affordable and accessible housing options, especial ly for those with the lowest incomes and people with disabilities. Support policies and legislation that create an infrastructure of programs and services that assist individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and their famil ies. Increase funding to local governments and school districts to meet the fiscal challenges of providing for a large population of individuals with ASD. ASD is the fastest growing serious developmental disability and has a national annual economic impact of $137 billion. In the County, the Department of Developmental Service s (DDS) Autism cases have increased 1,573 percent since 1990 (representing j ust a portion of the overall clinicallydefined population). The report, \"Autism Rising\", notes that based on current averages for cost of servi ces for adults with autism, Regional Center annual costs will nearly triple over the next ten years, and do not include nonregional center costs such as parental expenses, InHome Support Services, SSI or housing assistance, and do not address significant future factors such as aging parents, costofliving increases or the need for higher level of support as the ASD population ages. Increase employment opportunities for youth and adults with dis abilities. Support legislation and policies that fully fund supported employment services and alternate hir ing processes that promote competitive, integrated job placements for individuals with disabilities and close significant gaps in employment rates among those with and without disabilities. Engage in State and Federal funding opportunities designed to increase training and employment opportunities for people with disabilities. Reform Supplemental Security In come/State Supplemental Payment (SSI/SSP) Payment Structure. SSI/SSP payments are a critical source of income for people with disabilities, but current rates are tied to 1972 legislation and provide income below the poverty line. The SSI payment is below $900 a month. Support legislation that increases Supplemental Security Income payment s, raises asset limits and updates the earned and general income disregard for individuals with disabilities. Financial constraints contained in the program PAGE | 67 Alameda County State Legislative Priorities 2018 discourage savings, work and financial security through restric tions on income and asset limits. Create policies that encourage wealth building and lead to financial security, and include cost of living increases. Reform MediCal/DentiCal Program . MediCal and DentiCal remain the primary source of medical a nd dental care for those who meet the low income eligibility for M edicaid services. Poor reimbursement rates, lack of coordination between the State and the provider community, a nd outdated administrative processes result in lack of access and quality care. Support legislation that in creases reimbursement rates to a competitive level with commercial providers and creates policies that build a com prehensive, coordinated system of preventative care. COMMUNICABLE DISEASE CO NTROL AND PREVENTION Communicable diseases are among the top 10 leading causes of de ath in the United States and the fourth leading cause of death worldwide. Contro l of communicable disease is a core and mandated public safety function of government at the local, state, and federal levels. The three k ey activities of Communicable Disease Control and Prevention are epidemiology and surveillance, communicable dise ase response, and vaccinepreventable disease programs. In addition, local health departments are responsible for planning, preparedness and consequence management of natural and humanmade disasters such as communic able disease epidemics, pandemics, emerging infectious diseases and other natural disasters. Suppo rt for these critical areas will help to protect public health infrastructure and capaci ty to control and prevent commu nicable diseases in the County. The cumulative effects of budget cuts and personnel losses experienced during and after the recession have not been reversed, making it difficult to effective ly maintain daytoday essentia l functions, much less counter the spread of large outbreaks and novel and/or emerg ing infectious disease threats. Advocacy is needed for supplemental funding for specific public health emergencies (e.g. Ebola and Zika), a nd, more importantly, also for longer term re investment in local public health infrastructure which can sup port improved baseline communicable disease control and prevention, including more integrated systems and t raining to respond to larger scale events. Re investment in public health communicable disease control is mor e effective than allocation of intermittent short term grants for each new arising public health threat since oft en by the time specific funding is made available, it is well beyond the time period when it was urgently needed. Assure adequate resources are available to maintain staffing le vels and provide for staff development activities. Adequate staff with training and expertise provides the foundat ion of communicable disease prevention and control. Prevention and control programs need st aff with expertise in laboratory, (including bioinformaticists and bioinformatics training for public health laboratory and epidemiology staff to use and apply genomic sequencing data to detect and investigate outbrea ks and drug resistance), epidemiology, data management and analysis, outbrea k response, communications, hea lth education, and case and contact investigation including public health investigators, public hea lth nurses trained in communicable diseases, information systems specialists , and public health veterinarian s dedicated to the surveil lance and investigation of emerging infectious diseases and diseases causing outbreaks. This must include the rapid detection, monitoring, investigation, and c ontrol of outbreaks due to dise ases not supported by categorical funding. Capacity must also be maintained to allow for a surge in activi ties associated with recognized outbreaks or other communicable disease emergencies, such as pandemic influe nza, or other novel emerging or reemerging infectious threats that necessitate substantial increases in su rveillance, postexposure prophylaxis, and other public health interventions for weeks to months. Assure adequate resources for publ ic health laboratory services . Public health laboratory services are vital for communicable disease diagnosis, assessment of potential env ironmental threats, followup of cases and carriers of disease, and monitoring the effectiveness of vaccin es and other control measures. Recent budget cuts have crippled both local and state public health laborator y services and a major concern is the lack of availability of services previously available through the State public health laboratory system, which often takes as long as several weeks to produce bacterial identifications a nd important subtyping results needed to conduct timely and appropriate public health followup. Within the clin ical health care sector there is concern that the trend toward decreasing numbers of laboratory diagnoses confirm ation of a number of important PAGE | 68 Alameda County State Legislative Priorities 2018 communicable diseases is occurring to some extent due to the di sincentives built into capitated or otherwise \"managed\" care payment systems which places the burden on publi c health laboratories to perform testing to compensate for decreased testing by the clinical providers. Add itionally, public health laboratories face a significant crisis in the development of laboratory directors d ue to Federal and State regulations which specify the requirements for public health laboratory directors such th at, few qualified candidates currently exist, which means that several local California public health laborat ories will be without appropriate leadership in the coming years since previous programs to foster the developm ent of laboratory directors were cut due to budgetary consideration. Support secure electronic data exchange between health care sys tems, laboratories, he alth care providers and public health. Sustain funding at the state and local levels to fully implemen t and maintain electronic laboratory reporting and confidential morbidity reporting from laboratories and providers. Increase funding to develop and implement direct electronic reporting of reportable communicable disease data from electronic health records (EHR) to public health surveillance systems. Sup port the development of internetbased immunization registries linked to electronic health records and support measures to increase registry usage by all providers of immunizations, including pharmacists and schoo lbased clinics. Support Partner Services programs to prevent and control Sexual ly Transmitted Diseases (STDs). Partner Services play a proven and effective role in the prevention and control of STDs. All persons with newly diagnosed or reported early syphilis should receive partner ser vices that include act ive health department involvement. Partner services programs should use surveillance and disease reporting systems to assist in the identification of persons with newly diagnosed or reported syph ilis, gonorrhea, or highpriority chlamydia cases who are potential candidates for partner services. Full funding for partner services and restored funding for other prevention activities must be a high priority. Preserve and support efforts to eliminate tuberculosis (TB) by identifying and treating persons with latent TB Infection, including the use of shortcourse regimens and te chnologies to facilitate remote observation. The increase in active TB cases in California and Alameda Count y in 2015 and 2016 compared with 2014 reverses what had been a downward trend in case rates, and unde rscores the importance of testing and treating persons at high risk for latent TB infection to preven t their infection from progressing to active, infectious TB disease. Current funding of public health program s is focused on assuring that active TB patients complete their treatment and that their close contacts are test ed and treated for TB infection. However, additional resources are needed to find and treat the much larg er pool of persons who were infected in their countries of origin and who can develop active, infectious TB d isease many years later when their immune systems weaken due to aging or c hronic disease. Additionally, u niversal access to TB testing and treatment services without patient share of cost are critical priorities needed to reduce health disparities, prevent TB transmission in our communities, and achieve TB elimination in California. Support policies that assure access to vaccines for the populat ion. Policies must address the appropriate development, production, and dist ribution of vaccines necessary to protect the public's health and assure adequate funding for vaccine purchase, delivery, outreach and e ducation, especially for highrisk populations. Optimal immunization levels for all vaccinepreventable disease s must be aggressively pursued through immunization programs that are a ssured of continued adequate fu nding. Strategies should include universal infant immunization, required school entrance and advancement i mmunizations, innovative programs and mechanisms to improve vaccine delivery and uptake (such as scho olbased vaccine clinic s), and a continued focus on immunization of highrisk groups, including within spe cific settings or occupations with high risk of exposure and/or complications fr om vaccinepreventable diseases . Recommended immunizations for control of diseases in adults should be provided in all comprehensive i mmunization programs, and increased funding for overall outreach and educatio n about the importance and saf ety of vaccines is critical. Maintain and support ongoing funding for pandemic influenza, an d administration of local preparedness programs. Ongoing financial support is needed to maintain critical servic es such as Public Health Emergency Preparedness, Health Care Preparedness, Cities Readiness Initia tive, Pandemic Influenza, Urban Area Security Initiative, State Homeland Security Grant Program, and other cr ucial funding for emerging infectious diseases, natural disasters, and terrorism planning and response at the l ocal, state, regional, and federal level. PAGE | 69 Alameda County State Legislative Priorities 2018 Support policies and funding that provide resources to adapt an d develop locally relevant and culturally competent public education and outreach regarding communicable diseases, immunizations, and public health emergency preparedness and response. The broad diversity of local communities requires the capability to communicate in culturally relevant modes to ensur e the education and safe ty of all residents. Additional resources are needed i n order to adequately assess l o c a l c o m m u n i t i e s a n d s p e c i f i c h i g h r i s k populations in order to develop appropriate communications and outreach to educate and engage communities at risk. Promote & support policies and practices to prevent healthcare associated infections and antibiotic resistance. Healthcare associated infections (HAI) are infections acquired while receiving health care. They are increasingly becoming a significant cause of morbidity and mort ality in the U.S., and a substantial public health challenge. These infections are preventable and require robust programs and policies in order to reduce or eliminate HAIs. Effective policies and programs are also needed to strengthen the response to antimicrobial resistance, such as enhanced coordination and leadership, surve illance, prevention and control, and research efforts for new antibiotics and implementation of antibiotic st ewardship programs to improve appropriate use of antibiotics. ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH To ensure environmental quality and food safety in the community, Alameda County supports policies and legislation that would prioritize the following: Support Product Stewardship/Extended Producer Responsibility le gislation. Product Stewardship/Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is a strateg y that shifts the resp onsibility for end of life/residual management to the producer who finances it by int ernalizing the cost in the price of the product. This includes but is not limited to existing and emerging waste streams such as Pharmaceuticals, Sharps, Household Batteries, Fluorescent lamps and Marine flares, and S ingle use propane cylinders. Effective Product Stewardship/EPR legislation should apply to all manufacturers a cross a particular product spectrum, have minimum collection rates and prog ressing collection targets, an d no local preemption clause. Oppose any legislation that preempts or supersedes local contr ol over Household Hazardous Waste (HHW) programs, adds mandates without providing state or produc er funding, or supersedes local Product Stewardship/EPR ordinances and limits the role of manufactures and producers in product stewardship programs. In the 201516 legislative session AB 45 proposed statewide man dates for Household Hazardous waste programs to increase resident participation without provi ding a funding mechanism. AB 45 also attempted to preempt local product stewardship ordinances and a ttempted to limit the role of manufacturers and producers as merely communicating with consumers rather tha n funding and operating product takeback programs. We expect these attemp ts to preempt local ordinances to resurface in the 1819 legislative session. State legislation with the effect of weakening local ordinances and/or relieving manufacturers of responsibility for funding and operating takeback programs should be vigorous ly opposed. Support Invasive Species Program Funding. There are a number of significant invasive species being introduced and detected in California that threaten agriculture and the environment. Continued funding of Pest Exclusion, Pest Detection Trappi ng and Survey activities, Rapid Response, Pest Management and Eradication (if feasible), and Public Education Outreach Programs are critical to protect Alameda County's and California's resources. Oppose state legislation that re stricts the use of rodenticides by County Vector Control agencies. Recent state attempts to ban the use of rodenticides throughout the st ate will have a serious impact on controlling sewer rats within urban areas. These rodenticides are absolutel y critical to control serious rodent infestations and prevent the spread of plague, Hantavirus and other rodent b orne diseases. Rodent control using single dose rodenticides in urban sewer systems provides minimal threa t to wildlife living outside the sewer system. Rodent control using multipledo se rodenticides in tamperresis tance bait stations will p rovide a safety margin for wildlife. O p p o s e s t a t e l e g i s l a t i o n t h a t o v e r l y r e s t r i c t s t h e u s e o f D r o n e /Unmanned Aerial systems (UAS) by Environmental Health departments. Using UAS in rural settings to surveil and control mosquito and other PAGE | 70 Alameda County State Legislative Priorities 2018 vectors in remote locations can reduce the environmental impact on sensitive lands. Retaining information collected via UAS allows agencies to measure the changes in lan dscapes over time. Privacy rights, UAS flight, and data retention policies need to be balanced against the use of UAS for the protection of public health. Support legislation which increases the authority of Environmen tal Health departments to deal with emerging Public and Environmental Health Issues: A number of emerging Environmental Health issues will require increased Department authority to monitor and regulate threats to community health. Alameda County supports Health and Safety Code changes that broaden the Enviro nmental Health Department's authority to regulate o the following ( but not limited to ) emerging issues : Fracking, Green Chemistry, Carpet Recovery, Coal and Oil transport and transshipment, ensuring the safety o f organized camps, bedbug infestations, Zika virus, waste generated incident to Cannabis and extract cultiva tion and production, Cannabis edibles production and sales establishme nts, Food Waste composting, Rec ycling center requirements, Lead in drinking water, Cultivation of food for donation, barter, or swap, by sc hools non & profits, and threats to food safety by climate change induced alterations in vector geographic distrib utions. Support Legislation that provides regulators with more authorit y to oversee both existing and new Onsite Wastewater Treatment System. On June 19, 2012, the California State Water Resources Control Board (State Water Board) adopted the Water Quality Control Policy for Sitin g, Design, Operation, and Maintenance of Onsite Wastewater Treatment Syst ems (OWTS Policy). The state es timates that more than 1.2 million OWTS are installed and operating in California. As California's popu l a t i o n c o n t i n u e s t o g r o w , a n d w e s e e b o t h increased rural housing densitie s and the building of residence s and other structures in more varied terrain, the risks of causing environmental damage and creating public healt h risks from the use of OWTS increases. Regulatory oversight that may have been effective in the past m ay not continue to be as conditions and circumstances surrounding particular locations change. Supports legislation which provides funding assistance from the Clean Water State Revolving Fund, bond money from Proposition 1 (2014 Wat er Bond) and other sources to help private property owners and communities. There is a need for funding assistance to help private property owners and communities relying on OWTS with costs associated wit h complying with the State OWT S Policy. Toxics Reduction and Environmental Health. The release of toxic chemicals into our environment impact human health and the health of the ecosystems on which our comm unities rely. Policies to address this issue include: 1) Reducing Toxics Impact . Support legislation and pro grams that reduce the amount of chemicals released into our environment and that impact worker health inc luding, but not limited to, sustainable agriculture practices, integrated pest management, and micro pl astic pollution; 2) Toxic Chemical Regulation. Support policies to speed the evaluation of potentially dangero us chemicals and limit the use of chemicals and products known or suspected to have an adverse impact on human health and the environment; and 3) Public Health and Equity. Support policies and funding for programs th at prevent and mitigate the disproportionate environmental and health impacts of pollution and vehicular tra ffic through and within low income communities, including commodities being transported such as co al and crude oil. Oppose Legislation to legalize mi croenterprise home food prepar ation and sale of high risk cooked foods. California counties have an extensive system of food facility r egulation and inspection to ensure potentially hazardous foods receive careful preparation, using commercial e quipment, by food safety trained employees in a sanitary environment to prevent outbreaks of food borne illne ss. AB626 and successor microenterprise legislation seek to bypass these extensive safeguards to allow unregulated preparation of high risk foods by untrained preparers in a home kitchen setting with none of the safeguards found in commercial kitchens and restaurants. This would result in a vast increase in the outbre aks of food borne illness while increasing the difficulty in tracking its source. California already has a Cot tage Food law which allows the sale of certain non potentially hazardous foods prepared in privatehomes that are regulated by and inspected by local environmental health departments. EDUCATION To promote equity and ensure a br ight future for all children, the County supports Stateleve l education policies that achieve the following across the life course: Alameda County State Legislative Priorities 2018 Increase equitable funding in State Budget for public education regardless of immigration status and prioritize resources for lowincome students of color. Increase and create more e quitable and transparent funding to increase reading proficiency and literacy, particula rly for thirdgrade students of color, and promote family engagement, while ensuring fair taxation for residents a nd businesses. Promote i nvestments to increase parent engagement, to expand the arts, music, physical educatio n, academic tutoring, literacy and afterschool enrichment programs, to increase internships and college and ca reer preparedness, including funding of Linked Learning. Promote more flexible adult education, particularly t o support transitioning youth released from probation through support of Tra nsition Center services, allowi ng youth to finish credits towards receiving high school diplomas and improving the connection with school distri cts within County; in addition to increasing educational opportunities for people formerly incarcerated. As the Local Control Funding Formula is implemented, ensure adequate funding to build data capacity in school districts and stronger accountability measures and ensure supplemental funds for lowincome students, students with disabilities, English language learners, and foster youth are spent on programs and services t hat address their needs and improve equity in educational outcomes. Support policies and increased funding to ensure all high schoo l students graduate college and career ready. For those unable to graduate, support policies that assure the highest level of training that result in better employment outcomes, including obtaining a GED, alternat ive schools, on the job work experience or other pathways to receive high school diploma credits, such as Civic Corps. Support policies that prepare all high school students for college and career and promote equity in access to Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) curriculum while providing wraparound su pports. The County supports creating more opportunities for sustainable funding streams for Linked Learni ng, career pathways and career technical training, such as the California Career Pathway Trust Fund, par ticularly for lowincome students of color, students with disabilities, fos ter youth, and boys of color. Increase funding, access and affordability of postsecondary ed ucation and provide debt management assistance regardless of immigration status. Support policies and funding that promote equity in the community college and university systems and remove barriers to educational opportunities. Support policies that ensure affordable tuition and reduce and forgive student d ebt, particularly for lowincome communities and students of color. Additional ly, the County supports streng thening policies such as the DREAM Act that provide residency status and increase access and funding to pos tsecondary education for undocumented youth and legislation that exte nds and increases access to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals to increase deferred action from de portation and access to work pe rmits. Eliminate inequities in funding and access to quality teachers, particularly for teache rs of early childhood, special education, and Dual Language Learners. Support increases in investments in recruitment, retention and support of teachers through competitive salaries, highqual ity mentoring, and ongoing professional development, especially among teachers in lowincome schools, s pecial education teache rs, and teachers of English Language Learners. Increase mentoring and professional development of administrators and teachers including training on restorative practices, diversity, inclusi on, traumainformed care and mental health. Protect, stabilize and increase funding for Early Care and Educ ation professional development, including dedicated paid training days for staff at Title Vcontracted ce nters. Eliminate inequities to quality early childhood education acces s. Increase funding for Early Care and childhood education; adequately fund inclusive early childhood education classrooms. Increase efforts to subsidize early childhood programs, and improve the link betwee n reimbursement rates for Statecontracted programs and those funded with vouchers, and continue to expand funds for a Quality Rating and Improvement System for all Early Childhood Education programs. Increase funding to promote full service community schools and ensure all students are healthy and ready to learn. Support adoption of full service community schools, resources f or coordination of learning supports (i.e. community school coordinators), and promotion of partners hips between youth, families, schools, communitybased organizations, businesses, and other entities. Support increased funding for full service community schools through the ad option of comprehensive and sus tainable education revenues and a reform package that establishes an equitable, adequate finance system, ensures transparency, PAGE | 71 Alameda County State Legislative Priorities 2018 PAGE | 72 continues to enable greater local decisionmaking flexibility, and strengthens human capital and accountability. Support efforts that increase access to violence prevention pro grams and services, including programs that promote healthy inter personal relationships. Support policies that prevent the school to prison pipeline tha t disproportionately affects low income students of color and students with disabilities. Provide funding for programs and services that reduce chronic student absenteeism and truancy, particularly in schools with l ow academic performa nce and lowincome students of color, particularly African American and Latino mal es. Provide funded mandates requiring schools to create an absenteeism and tru ancy early warning system that identifies frequently absent children and connects them and their families with comprehensive, wraparound services and interventions such as coordinated medical care, behavioral and mental health services , youth development programs, and parent, family, and community engagemen t programs. Increase funding for male involvement programs and mentoring that aim to reduce disparities in early literacy skills, gradua tion rates, and dropout rates for lowincome students of color, partic ularly boys of color. Ensure students with disabilities have equitable access to educ ational opportunities. Improve the identification rate of students with disabilities to promote eq ual access to education through accommodations, modifications in curriculum, or through the development of spec ialized technical or vocational training courses The County supports the State's Employment First policy which e stablishes the value of work and makes integrated competitive employmen t the highest priority. Increas e efforts to utilize benefit planning to support Employment First policies. Support policies and practices to eliminate the use of physical f o r c e a n d s e c l u s i o n a n d e l i m i n a t e disproportionate suspension and expulsion rates among students of color and students with disabilities. Eliminate punitive and zero tolerance policies and preschool su spensions. The County supports legislation that promotes positive school climates and calls for funding threet iered behavioral health supports (i.e., universal, targeted and individual supports), staff and teacher training a nd consultation for the creation of trauma/ healinginformed classrooms and schools to foster early in tervention alternatives to expulsions and suspensions, and reforms in suspension policies for defiance at a l l g r a d e l e v e l s , p a r t i c u l a r l y f o r A f r i c a n American students, and Latino and Pacific Islander males. The C ounty supports policies that increase transparency, accountability and professional development of ad ministrators and teachers including training on restorative practices, diversity, inclusion and mental health w ith a focus on traumainformed care. Promote health and wellness among all students and healthy scho ol environments. Increase access to safe, appropriate health, dental and mental health services within sc hools, including schoolbased health centers, particularly for students of color and students in families wit h mixed immigration status, and increased funding flexibility for County services and for building teacher and pa rental awareness of sexually exploited minors. The County supports comprehensive w ellness policies and funding tha t reduce chronic diseases , including asthma and diabetes and communicable disease, including sexually trans mitted infections (STI's), promotes programs aimed at decreasing teen pregnan cy and STI's, particularly amon g youth of color, and that reduce childhood obesity and other physical activi ty and dietrela ted diseases. The County supports policies that create healthy school environments both oncam pus and the surrounding neighbor hoods, including policies that improve access to fresh and nutritious food in and around schools, prot ecting and strengthening nutrition guidelines and increasing funding in the Far m Bill Reauthorization, prohib it unhealthy food vendors at or near schools, increase access to clean and safe drinking water, and prevent u nnecessary exposure to environmental toxins. The County supports the inclusion of youth in decisionmaking p rocesses, including former probation youth and foster youth. IMMIGRATION Alameda County supports statele vel policies that achieve the f ollowing: Increase access to culturally and linguistically appropriate he alth and behavioral health care among immigrants, including unaccompanied immigrant youth: The County supports: (1) legislation that increases Alameda County State Legislative Priorities 2018 PAGE | 73 equitable access to quality, affordable health care coverage an d service; includes undocumented and other immigrants not covered by the Affordable Care Act; and promotes culturally and linguistically appropriate care; (2)policies and funding to reduce barriers to the enrollment of documented and undocumented immigrants and their family members in MediCal; (3) policies that provide a \"No Wrong Door\" fund for school and communitybased Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic and Tr eatment (EPSDT) providers; and (4) policies and efforts to streamline, integrate and coordinate services an d providers, such as a 'onestop' approach to services. Minimize the harmful local impacts of federal immigration polic y and increase access to legal services : The County supports: (1) policies that ensure a separation between local law enforcement and the federal deportation system which lacks s ufficient due process; policies that address the public safety, civil liberties, local resource burden, accountability and transparency issues r elated to federal immigration enforcement systems; (2) policies that limit transfers and holds in local j ails and reduce the risk and fear of deportation such as in the Transparent Review of Unjust Transfers and Holds (TRU TH) Act of 2016 (AB 2792),the TRUST Act of 2014 (AB 4), and the CA Values Act (SB 54); and work towards mo nitoring compliance with these bills within Alameda County; (3)policies that reinforce and strengthen priva cy protections for state residents, and that promote the constitutional and civil rights of patients, studen ts, workers and individuals seeking critical services in the event of an immigration enforcement action; and (4) policies and programs that ensure the right and create access to an attorney during immigration proceedings for all immigrant adults, including adults, families and unaccompanied immigrant youth, regardless of crimi nal or immigration history, and funding to ensure the provision of free legal assistance. Protect against racial profiling based on \"perceived\" immigrati on status, ethnicity, religion, language or national origin: The County supports legislation, such as AB 524, signed into la w on Oct. 5, 2013, that identifies and eliminates racial profiling in public and private sectors. Protect the health and welfare of all children, including child ren whose parents are being detained or deported by Immigration Customs Enforcement (ICE) or Border Pat rol: The County supports policies that emphasize the needs and welfare of children by prioritizing fam ily unity, providing resources for unaccompanied immigrant minors, and creating appropriate, human itarian, transparent, and accountable training policies and protocols for interacting with and screen ing children. Increase access to critical safety net services for immigrants: The County supports policies and funding to expand California Food Assistance Program eligibility to includ e all immigrants who meet all other program requirements including individuals granted deferred action and other lawfully residing individuals. Promote public safety by ensuring that reporting crimes, includ ing domestic violence, to local authorities, does not lead to deportation proceedings: The county supports work with local law enforcement to ensure t o the extent possible that reporting of crimes does not lead to d eportation or other adverse consequences. The county supports programs and safet y measures that strengthen pr otections for all victims involved, to reduce the likelihood of victims being placed in removal proceedings. Protect access to all public space s, including courthouses, to ensure that all individuals regardless of immigration status are protected in those spaces: The County supports programs that protect access to courthouses, libraries, homeless shelters, and other social ser vice providers, so that all individuals can access these spaces. Protect and promote the wellbeing of immigrant workers, includ ing undocumented workers: The County supports legislation that protect s immigrant workers, especiall y the vulnerable undocumented population, from wage theft, and extends important labor standards to jobs predominantly occupied by immigrants, such a s m i g r a n t w o r k e r s a n d d o m e s t i c workers. The county also suppor ts legislation that protects immigrant workers from possible immigrationrelated retaliation by their employers. Ensure nondiscriminatory, equal treatment under the law, and pr otect the confidentiality and privacy of individuals: The County supports actions that affirmatively extend access to public services and benefits for all residents, regardless of immigration status, limit inquiries an d reduce the collection and recording of information about immigration status, and prohibit the disclosu re of information about persons seeking or receiving social services for pur poses not directly related to administering the program or protecting individual Alameda County State Legislative Priorities 2018 PAGE | 74 or public health. This includes policies that prohibit landlord s from threatening to report tenants to Immigration Customs Enforcement (ICE). Due process should also be ensured for immigrants in federal and local detention facilities and those facing deportation. Multisector collaborations between community, advocacy, and go vernment sectors to address health and build power amongst vulnerable populations, including immigrant s. JOBS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT CREATE A STRONG AND ROBUST JOBDRIVEN SYSTEM Invest in Systems and Policies that Support Workers and Employe rs Preserve and enhance Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act ( WIOA) Funding. Alameda County supports preserving and fully res toring WIOA funding. WIOA is a federal law passed in 2014, which reauthorized the nation's employment and training programs rela ted to adult, dislocated workers and youth, as well as adult education and vocational rehabilitation programs created under the Workforce Investment Act (WIA). With recent deep budget cuts across all WIOA program are as, some of the goals of the legislation are unlikely to be met. Additional funding is needed to continue im plementation of WIOA. At the core of WIOA is an emphasis on facilitating a ccess to highquality training pro grams that lead to industryrecognized valued credentials/certificates within highgrowth industries and occu pations. To accomplish this, specific funding is needed to develop better coordinated training programs for job seekers. More funding is needed for enhanced supportive services for job seekers, increased stipends for you th participants in workbased learning programs, and for the coordination and alignment of Local Workforce Devel opment Boards (LWDBs), California Community College Districts, Adult Schools/Adult Consortium, K 12 education, and Economic Development agencies. Invest in education that prepares individuals for the 21st century workforce. Alameda County supports the alignment of the education and workforce investment systems to m e e t t h e n e e d s o f t h e 2 1st century workforce, which promotes and develops a welleducated and high lyskilled workforce. A special effort should be made to support education in the Science, Technology, Educat ion, and Math (STEM) areas and other career within highgrowth sec tors and occupations. Support affordable higher education. Alameda County supports affordable higher education that provid es greater access to people seeking credentials and degrees. The c ost of college often poses a hardship to graduates and a barrier to people trying to enter higher educat ion to pursue career interests. Research shows the staggering difference in income between people who pursue s ome form of higher education as opposed to those who don't, and that 48 percent of occupations in the Coun try will be middleskill s jobs by the year 2024 and 43 percent in California. Middleskills jobs require more t han a high school education but less than a four year degree, so investments in Career Technical Education (CTE) are critical. The success of the economy will partially rely on how well job seekers are prepared to compete within the economy. Alameda County supports affordable higher education that prepares workers to succeed in the labor market. Support fair, sustainable, and nonstagnant wages. Alameda County supports policies that aim to create livable wages, promote income mobility, and close the gender an d racial wage gaps. Alameda County supports wage growth and policies/strategies that promote income mobilit y, in order to combat wage stagnation. Support fair scheduling policies. Alameda County supports fair scheduling policies that give work ers sufficient time to make alternative arrangements in their sched ules, if needed. Parttime workers are subject to last minute scheduling changes, affecting their ability to f i n d c h i l d c a r e i n a t i m e l y m a n n e r o r m a k e transportation arrangements pu tting worker's jobs at risk. Promote job creation and economic development. Alameda County supports policies and programs that create local jobs. Specifically, Alameda County supports tax in centives, innovative funding mechanisms to support public/private partnerships, waivers, support for small businesses and entrepreneurs, and policies that Alameda County State Legislative Priorities 2018 PAGE | 75 promote/support locallymade products. Policies should increase resources for \"proactive\" business assistance programs that prevent closures and mitigate job loss. Support integrated and supported employment opportunities for i ndividuals with disabilities in alignment with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Alameda County supports inclusive policies and programs that provide integrated employment opportunities for individuals wit h disabilities, as well as proper accommodations and supports in the workplace. Extend workplace rights, protect ions, and resources to all vict ims of crime. All victims should be treated with dignity and respect by their employer and should have acce ss to reasonable time off to receive medical treatment and recover from the crime. Alameda County supports p olicies that assist victims of crime in maintaining employment, while receiving the proper stabilizatio n services. Support resources and policies that promote workforce alignment activities articulated in Alameda County Workforce Development Board's Regional and Local Plan. Alameda County supports and reaffirms the Regional and Local Plan of the Alameda County Workforce Develop ment Board (ACWDB), which acts as a strategic road map for the implementation of the WIOA. The Regi onal and Local Plan calls for collaborative partnerships that strengthen training outcomes and employment o utcomes, and services to job seekers, while enhancing employer engagement and services in Alameda County. Support preapprenticeship and apprenticeship programs. Alameda County supports robust pre apprenticeship and apprenticeship programs that prepare youth a nd adults for employment within high growth industries and occupations. The apprenticeship model is a tried and true approach for helping job seekers simultaneously find meaningful training while earning a sustain able wage. Preapprenticeships prepare participants for competitive apprenticeship programs and equip youth and adults with both soft and hard skill development, as well as mentor ship opportunities from industry experts. Support the alignment between workforce development, adult educ ation, and the community college districts. Alameda County supports the alignment between the existing part ners in the workforce system, as education and workforce are inextricably linked and together to support the success of current and future workers. Coordination and alignment in the workforce system wil l streamline services and reduce duplication of efforts, and will set the sta te for collabora tive and innova tive partnerships. E n s u r e t h e s y s t e m a t i c i n c l u s i o n o f t h e L o c a l W o r k f o r c e D e v e l o p m ent Boards (LWDBs) in the implementation and planning for, the Strong Workforce Initiativ e. The Strong Workforce Initiative grew out of AB 1602 (Statues of 2015) and $200 million was included in the 20162017 budget. The Strong Workforce Program places emphasis on the expansion of quality Career Tech nical Education leading to the attainment of industryvalued middle skill cred entials as a proven path to so cial and economic mobility and career advancement. This program aligns with WIOA and it is vital that LWDBs are included at the table with adult school, economic development, K12, and industry leaders to inf orm course offerings, develop training programs, and align efforts to r educe duplication of service to students and job seekers. Support Adult Education program and funding. Alameda County supports adult education as a means to assist adults in educational remediation or training to update skills, in order to compete in today's local e c o n o m y . A d u l t e d u c a t i o n p r o g r a m s a l s o h a v e a p r o v e n t r a c k r e c o rd for bridging individuals to higher education, as well as assisting immigrant populations, includin g undocumented, in acquiring skills in English, improving employment prospects a nd educational outcomes. With t he passage of AB 86 in 2013 and AB 104 in 2015, Adult Schools have an increa sed presence throughout the S tate. AB 104 established the Adult Education Block Grant (AEBG) Program under the administration of the Chan cellor of the California Community Colleges and the Superintendent of Public Instruction. The ABEG program allocates funding to regional adult school consortia throughout the State and calls for accountability, ov ersight, and performance to meet adult educational outcomes. Support local hire policies . Alameda County supports expanding and promoting local hire po licies, including precluding State agencies or dep artments from authorizing call center contracts for public assistance or health benefit programs if they hire em ployees outside California to p erform the work. Support small businesses in ramping up to fully implement the $ 15/hour minimum wage in California. Alameda County supports working co llaboratively with Economic D evelopment agencies to provide Alameda County State Legislative Priorities 2018 PAGE | 76 technical assistance to small bu sinesses, as the minimum wage h ike may affect small businesses and the workers within those small bus inesses more profoundly. Supporti ng small businesses in this way may minimize the impact on workers who may otherwise be at risk for being la id off as a result of the minimum wage increases. Support the alignment between workforce and financial education programs. Alameda County supports programs and policies that integ rate financial education with w orkforce and education. Financial education is a safeguard against predatory lending and empowers individuals to make better financial decisions, helping workers spend wisely and save th e earnings they've worked hard to acquire for themsel ves and their families. Support Individuals with Barriers to Employment Support policies that create empl oyment and educational opportu n i t i e s f o r l o n g t e r m u n e m p l o y e d workers, individuals with disabilities, returning/reentry popu lations, lowincome adul ts, marginally attached workers, atrisk youth, and older workers. Alameda County supports subsidized employment, supportive services, summer and yearround employment opportunities for yo uth (including youth in foster care), and programs/resources to help lowincome adults, CalWORKs clients, Limited English Proficient (LEP) clients, re entry populations, marginally attached populations, and older w orkers obtain the proper education and training leading to employment and income mobility. Support programs that develop and/or enhance employment and edu cational services to Limited English Proficient (LEP) and immigrants populations. Alameda County supports programs that create access to employment, training, and supportive services for LEP and immig rant populations, as well as legislation that promotes the alignment between WIOA and the Development, Relief , and Education for Alien Minors (DREAM) Act programs, to support the educational attainment of immigran t and foreignborn individuals. Policies should support the partnership between t he LWDBs and entities carrying out DREAM Act programs. Support and expand workforce development efforts that promote c areer pathways and address racial, cultural, and economic disparities in employment outcomes.

Alameda C ounty supports innovative programs that help older adults and individuals with disabilities access training and employment opportunities that lead to competitive and integrated employment. Specifically, we support policies such as subsidized employment or tax incentives that encourage employers to hire older adults an d individuals with disabilities. Remove the criminal background check requirement from initial j ob application requirements. Alameda County supports policies and legislation that support fair hiri ng for formerly incarcerated individuals, as well as strategies and policies designed to reduce recidivism. Economic opportunity is greatly diminished for formerly incarcerated individuals (who are disproportionately people of color) because of employment discrimination against people with criminal records. California and the federa l government should pass broad \"Ban the Box\" legislation that requires an employer to determine a job applic ant's minimum qualifications before obtaining and considering information regarding the applicant's convictio n history. Support programs and policies that prepare formerly incarcerate d individuals for employment before release. Alameda County supports programs and policies that are designed to help formerly incarcerated individuals prepare for employme nt opportunities before release , offering them a greater chance to succeed in the labor market.

Alameda County supports innovative programs that provid e relevant interventions to help reentry clients become contributing memb ers of their communities and so ciety. Align and leverage SB 1. SB 1 was signed by the Governor in 2017 and establishes the Roa d Maintenance and Rehabilitation Program to address deferred maintenance on t he state highway system and the local street and road systems. While the fundi ng would be generated by a veh icle gas tax, the program requires that $5 million over the course of five years is used to promote and im plement preapprenticeship programs. SB 1 would also authorize $2 million to be allocated to the Universi t y o f C a l i f o r n i a a n d t h e C a l i f o r n i a S t a t e University, respectively, for the purpose of conducting transpo rtation research and transportationrelated workforce education, training, and development. Alameda County supports the alignment between workforce development programs, and the leverage of SB 1 for workforce de velopment programs. Such alignment and leverage will put the muchneeded resources behind implementing and scaling effective preapprenticeship programs in Alameda County. Align and leverage AB 1111. AB1111 or the Removing Barriers to Employment Act, if passed, w ould establish a competitive grant program for activities that address the nee ds of individuals with multiple barriers to employment. AB 111 would prepare people with multiple employmen t barriers for training, apprenticeship, or employment opportunities, leading to economic stability. The in itiative would target: veterans, disconnected youth, women seeking training or education in nontraditional f ields of employment, displaced workers, the longterm unemployed, unskilled or underskilled workers, lowe arning workers, English Language Learners, the economically disadvantaged, CalWORKs participants, formerly inc arcerated individuals, Native Americans, migrant or seasonal farmworkers, and people with developmental or other disabilities. Alameda County supports the alignment between workforce development programs, and the leverage of AB1111 for workforce development programs t hat provide crucial supports to people with barri ers to employment. Align and leverage workforce pro grams and job opportunities for reentry/formerly incarcerated populations. Alameda County supports the alignment with other agencies and e xisting programs, like AB 109 p r o g r a m s , t o e x p a n d a c c e s s a n d r e t e n t i o n i n w o r k a n d e m p l o y m e n t related activities. Alameda County supports innovative programs and policies that provide longter m employment strategies, and supportive and behavioral health services, desi gned to reduce re cidivism for r eentry populations. Expand Opportunities for Youth I n v e s t i n i n t e n s i v e s u m m e r p r o g r a m s g e a r e d t o w a r d w o r k r e a d i n e s s and STEMrelated occupations. Alameda County supports initiatives, policies, and programs des igned to help youth prepare for employment, apprenticeships and higher education. Summer workreadiness pro grams geared toward STEMrelated occupations, and/or other indemand occupations, provide applie d learning opportunities and ongoing engagement during summer time, where lowincome youth are speci fically atrisk for losing ground in their education. Summer time can be leveraged to help vulnerable yout h learn while gaining valuable work experience, boosting their confidence and helping youth perform better in the academic school year or while pursuing an internship/apprenticeship opportunity. Summer progr ams also expose youth to careers that will pave their way into career pathways and other earnandlearn op portunities offered yearlong. Preserve, support, and expand programs that serve young people. Alameda County supports investments in programs and services targeted at young people both in and o utofschool to assist them in their career and educational development. Specifi cally, programs should target y oung people who are atrisk for dropping out of school or have left school, foster youth, homeless youth, ju venile justice involved youth, and other youth with barriers to employment. Preserve, support and expand pro g r a m s t h a t i n v o l v e p a r e n t s / g u a r d i a n s i n t h e w o r k f o r c e p r o g r a m s . Alameda County supports twogeneration strategies that improve the education and career readiness of youth, while simultaneously improving the education and career readine ss of parents/guardians. Alameda County supports the dual engagement and education of parents/guardians and students in decisions related to career path development for youth, incl uding breaking myths related to higher education and training opportunities. Parent/guardians and students should have the most relevant and accurate information to arrive at decisions Alameda County State Legislative Priorities 2018 PAGE | 78 related to career pathways. Students should feel supported in pursuing prospective careers, while maintaining a sense of autonomy. Support programs designed to reduce the youth unemployment rate and provide/enhance relevant work experience. One year estimates for youth unemployment in Alameda County for youth ages 1619 is 14.8 percent and 8.3 percent for yout h ages 2024, translating rough ly as 23 times greater than the overall unemployment rate in Alameda Co unty. Employment opportunities for youth can be a protective factor, h e l p i n g y o u t h t o f o r m p o s i t i v e interpersonal relationships, build confidence, and relevant work experience. Connecting this early work experience to training o pportunities and highgrowth career pathways can lead to successful outcomes later in adulthood. Al ameda County supports programs and initiatives designed to reduce t he youth unemployment rate and strengthen work experiences that lead to highgrowth career pathways. Support youth voice in program design and implementation. Alameda County supports the integration of youth vice and perspective in the development and implementatio n of workforce development programs and initiatives. A humancentered design perspective illuminates th e importance of designthinking and involves client voice at the forefront of program development. It also leverages that same voice throughout the testing, operationalizing, and evaluation of programs. Support Career Technical Education programs and Career Pathway Program initiatives. Alameda County supports extensions to Career Technical Education (CTE) program s and initiatives that strengthen the partnerships and linkages between workforce development boards, and educational institutions that help students participate in career pathways and prepare them for tr aining opportunities, higher education, and employment. IMPROVING HEALTH OUTCOMES BY A DDRESSING SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS The County supports the following policies in order to improve the economic and health outcomes of all its residents: Improve wages and benefits for all workers: The County supports oversight over employers to implement California's historic state minimum wage that will reach $15 in 2020. Oversight should include programs to increase workforce participation for persons with developmental disabilities to protect those workers and prevent downward pressure on wages for others. Ensure that prov iders are reimbursed according to the state mandated wage level. Protect worker health and safety: Strengthen existing laws and enforcement for worker health and safety, including paid sick days and family leave. Support policies to ensure healthy and safe working conditions and to prevent unnecessary harmful exposures for all workers; this inc ludes increasing funding for enforcement, penalties for violators of healt h and safety laws, and meaningf ul regulations of dangerous chemicals. Protect and expand workers' rights: Enact State legislation that pro tects and strengthens workers' right to organize and collectively bargai n. This includes protecting the rights of temporary and contingent workers and support for policies that require fair and stable work schedule s. Support efforts to educate workers, including youth and immigrants, including undocumented immigrants, about worker rights. Support policies that incentivize and enable businesses to hire and retain local resi dents. Restore civil rights protections and reduce barriers for former ly incarcerated people in the workplace : Formerly incarcerated individuals often struggle to access qual ity employment because of barriers maintained by State policy. The County suppo rts policies that prevent disc rimination in hiring and enable formerly incarcerated individuals to access quality jobs and economic st ability. Increase access to entrepreneurship opportunities: (1) Support small businesse s and microenterprise, especially those owned by women, minorities and persons with de velopmental disabilities, through expanding fair access to safe and sustainable credit and capital; (2) Sup port cooperatives and create incentives for employee ownership through State policies that promote sound bu siness conversion to cooperative business models as well as removing barriers to starting cooperative bu sinesses; and (3) Support policies that expand Alameda County State Legislative Priorities 2018 PAGE | 79 access to capital among entrepreneurs of color and people with disabilities, such as working with the State to use its contracts with financial institutions to increase lendi n g a n d e x t e n s i o n o f c r e d i t i n l o w i n c o m e communities and communities of color. Improve the quality of lowwage jobs and provide pathways to mi ddlewage jobs: Enforce and modernize labor laws, including closing loopholes that allow employers to misclassify workers as independent contractors and preventing wage theft. Undocumented workers have the highes t rates of wage and hour violations and must be included in prevention efforts. Support strategies to e stablish sectorbased training programs, pipelines from apprenticeships and credentialing programs to in dustries with job growth, and improved career navigation systems. Preserve and expand the social safety net: The County supports strong safe ty net programs, including better funding and reform of unemployment insurance to cover mo re workers, adequate benefits for state disability and workers compensation programs, and public benefi ts. Ensure equitable taxation: Tax code benefits accrue to the wealthiest 5 percent of taxpaye rs and largely miss the assetpoor majority in this country. Meaningful incent ives to save for residents of all income groups should be provided, and the tax system should benefit all resid ents equally. Successful tax credits, such as the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) should be expanded to continue lifting California residents out of poverty. Establish standards for public dollars to be invested equitably for economic opportunity: Resources should b e t a r g e t e d t o a r e a s w h e r e s u s t a i n e d d i s i n v e s t m e n t h a s p r o d u c e d concentrated poverty and lack of opportunity. Government spending can also be used to shift more industries to provide better wages and benefits through approaches like living wage standards, communi ty benefits agreements, prevailing wage ordinances, and project labor agreements. In addition, the Coun ty supports supplier diversity policies which require businesses to engage in proactive and measureable effor ts to provide diverse suppliers equal access to contracting opportunities. Support asset and wealthbuilding efforts while regulating agai nst unfair financial practices. Policies and practices that prevent predatory financial practices, increase access to quality financial services and products, and support financial literac y will help to build wealth. LOCAL GOVERNMENT LOCAL JURISDICTION AND TAX SYSTEM Local governance. The County must have adequate authority, flexibility and resour ces to meet its role as agent of the State and local service provider. The County suppo rts efforts to ensure local discretionary control over governance issues and the delivery of services and opposes legislation that preempts the county's authority or limits the county's ability to operate in a reason able and cost effective manner. Support the guarantee of dependable, predictable, and equitable revenue streams to support programs needed by County residents. The County supports opportunities for increasing State revenues and expansion of the County's ability to generate local revenues and opposes the shift of any further property taxes or other revenues away from the County. Support legislation and increased funding to support the County 's infrastructure needs and expand capital investments vital to economic development. Support State and federal funding for infrastructure investment s that improve seismic safety of essential government facilities. Support the extension of DesignBuild and Public Private Partnership authority for local governments and expand the existing public contract code definition of \"Project\" to allow more flexible use of these project delivery methodologies. Support legislation that maintains or increases levels of State funding for mandated programs and services to meet the increased costs of delivering programs and services . Support legislation to require the State to provide ongoing, guaranteed funding to counties and other local governments for the cost of providing services t h a t w e r e s h i f t e d i n t h e 2 0 1 1 R e a l i g n m e n t f r o m t h e S t a t e t o l o c al government and InHome Supportive Services. Alameda County State Legislative Priorities 2018 PAGE | 80 Support equitable taxation, a tax system that benefits all resi dents equally and can serve to reduce poverty. Support expansion of the State Earned Income Tax credit and r eforming Proposition 13 by creating a Split Roll Property Tax that would require businesses to pay a higher share of property taxes. Support marketplace equity and consumer protection. Weights and Measure programs are important to businesses and consumers in Alame da County and throughout Calif ornia. These programs ensure that there is a \"level playing field\" for business and industries. Likewise, these programs are critical in providing protection for consumers and a method for m aking value comparisons by safe guarding equity in the marketplace. Local regulation of cannabis. Support legislation that ensures cannabis, whether for recreati onal or medical use, remains a taxable commodity, the county retains its local taxing authority and receives tax revenue from this source as well as retains l ocal regulatory control over ma tters such as sale, distribution, production, cultivation. Encourage local partnerships to fight illegal dumping. Multiple stakeholders play a role in responding to illegal dumping, including Public Works Agency, Environmental H ealth Department, Public Health Department, Community Development Agency's Code Enforcement, public protect ion agencies, and waste management companies. Additionally, illegal dumping has become a regional issue. The County supports partnerships with all stakeholders to develop, imp lement and promote solutions to illegal dumping. Increase enforcement efforts for illegal dumping. The majority of illegal dump ing is done without someone w i t n e s s i n g t h e a c t a n d t h e r e f o r e i t b e c o m e s v e r y d i f f i c u l t t o p r o s e c u t e t h e r e s p o n s i b l e p a r t y . I n s o m e instances, however, there may be mail or other identifying info rmation which can be used to cite/fine parties responsible for the dumped materi al. The County supports regula ting, licensing, prohibiting and enforcement of unlicensed independent wastes haulers in order to combat ill egal dumping. Increase funding for illegal dumping programs. Funds collected through fines i mposed for illegal dumping can be placed in this special revenue account and used for outr each and educational programs to combat illegal dumping as well as surveillance cameras to capture the illegal activity. The County supports policies, funding, programming and grants ta rgeting illegal dumping, part icularly a proactive approach to alleviating hotspot areas. The County also s upports identifying a portion o f solid waste fees that could be earmarked for illegal dumping enforcement and remediation. Restore Opportunities for City Incorporation. The county recognizes that city incorporation can provide residents with additional local authority to govern their munic ipal affairs and provide more tailored and local services to the wants and needs of a community, including acces s to some funds available to cities. Incorporation can also reduce burdens on county government to f ulfill service needs across broad geographical areas. For these reasons, the county supports loca l incorporation efforts in areas where significant resident interest exists, and the incorporation is determined to be fiscally viable under reasonable terms. Fiscal viability for incorporation of unincorporated communitie s. The county also recognizes that the passage of SB 89, Chapter 35 of 2011, removed a vital funding s ource relied upon by incorporating communities and seriously undermined the fiscal viability of ci ty formation and many potential annexations of unincorporated areas by cities. W hile the Legislature approved SB 130, Chapter 9, Statutes of 2017, to address t h e f i s c a l h a r m c a u s e d t o f o u r r e c e n t l y i n c o r p o r a t e d c i t i e s i n Riverside County, the law has no similar accommodation for the needs of fu ture incorporations. The count y supports legislation that would restore the fiscal viability of city incorporations based on the same formu la that was used to resolve issues for the four recently incorporate d cities via SB 130. Oppose the transfer of programs from the State to counties unless program control and flexibili ty are also shifted and adequate State funding is guaranteed. PLANNING LAND USE AND HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT LAND USE PLANNING To create healthy and vibrant communities, the County supports policies and legislation that would: Alameda County State Legislative Priorities 2018 PAGE | 81 Include health and equity in General Plans and Land Use Plans. Require a health and wellness element, health language, health analysis, or health standards in all Ge neral Plans, as well as in guidelines from the State Office of Planning and Researc h. The County also supports colla borative planning processes that give communities more power to influen ce land use plans and policies as well as associated capital infrastructure budget investments. I n c r e a s e l o c a l a u t h o r i t y a n d g o v e r n a n c e o v e r e n e r g y p r o c u r e m e n t t o s t r e n g t h e n A l a m e d a C o u n t y ' s Community Choice Aggregation program, the East Bay Community Energy joint powers agency, promoting local procurement of energy and program development that builds community sustainability, lowers Green House Gas (GHG), and creates local jobs. Limit access to alcohol, tobacco, and other unhealthy goods. Certain neighborhoods and communities in the County are overburdened with a concentration of alcohol and tob acco outlets that are often in lowincome communities of color. Fully fund and empower State agencies to enforce laws and regulations against alcohol and tobacco license holders in order to eliminate illegal activ ities in these communities and reduce the overconcentration of these outlets. Discourage consumption of u nhealthy foods and sugary beverages that are linked to the obesity epidemic and chronic diseases. Promote healthy, livable, and resilient communities. Prevent, reduce, and mitigate toxic emissions and chemical exposure, as well as other environmental impacts that harm the public and workers health and quality of life, particularly in lowincome communities of color, inclu ding ensuring access to clean drinking water. The County supports policies that cre ate opportunities for more hea lthy food access and access to affordable housing, develop sustainable built environments that reduce urb an heat island effects, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and other climate impacts on health and prepare comm unities to adapt to climate change, specifically in lowincome communities of color. In addition, t he County supports policies that prevent displacement of current residents when improving communities. Support mineral resource management. To reduce greenhouse gases and encourage extraction of quarried materials in \"Regionally Signifi cant Construction Aggregate Res ource Areas\" should be encouraged. Aggregate from these resource areas is use d for the construction industry , much of it occurring in the County, mostly in the urban centers and highly developed areas. To reduce emissio ns and discourage long hauls of aggregate material, quarries in Regionally Significant Construction Aggre gate Resource Areas should continue to be recognized as a regional asset, and every effort should be made to promote compatibility between quarries and adjacent land uses. Limit or prohibit the extraction , handling and tr ansportation o f fossil fuels. Limit or prohibit hydraulic fracturing (fracking) and the ha ndling and transportation of fo ssil fuels at Port facilities. Locally, the County has moved to limit oil and gas extraction, including a ban on enhan ced recovery methods including hydraulic fracturing. Maintain local authority over the siting and operation of canna bis operations. Continue to recognize each local jurisdiction's authority t o determine the appropriate typ e, size, and location of cannabis operations to be located in their communities. Support funding at the local leve l to address health and safety concerns regarding cannabis use. HOMELESSNESS AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING The County's goal is to ensure adequate, affordable, safe, and highquality housing for all of its residents. Without longterm resources dedicated to developing and maintaining aff ordable housing, this goal will be unreachable. The elimination of Redevelopment Agencies in 2012 significantly reduced funds available for the development of affordable housing, which have not been fully replaced. The Cou nty and other localities are doing their part, for example passing a $580 Million lo cal bond for affordable housin g in 2016, but these local sources are not sufficient on their own. Creating a permanent source of funding for afford able housing is a top priority in maintaining the housing opportunities and infrastructure needed in the unincorp orated areas of the County, the County as a whole, and Statewide. Alameda County State Legislative Priorities 2018 PAGE | 82 To this end, the County supports: I n c r e a s e d f u n d i n g f o r a f f o r d a b l e h o u s i n g f o r e x t r e m e l y l o w a n d lowincome households. Affordable housing improves positive community impacts such as housing sta bility, employment, mental and physical health, and school attendance and reduces active substance use, criminal justice recidivism, and other negative community impacts. Housing is considered affordable when monthl y housing costs, including utilities, are no more than 30 percent of total household income. Homelessness is inhumane and also increases costs to emergency and safety net systems . The County supports policies which increase the supply of and access to affordable housing, particularly for low and extremelylowinc ome residents, including policies such as mixed income housing, increased funding for affordable housing development and permanent rental assistance, and promoting the development of new funding source s to replace those lost to federal budget reductions, the elimination of redevelopment agencies, and redu ctions in available State funding. Safe and healthy housing. The County supports \"green\", healthy, safe and highquality hou sing, particularly for lowincome people. Housing quality has a significant impact on people's health and wellbeing. Issues such as the existence of lead, water leaks, poor ventilation, mold, dirty carpets, pest infestations, and location near toxic sources can result in numerous health problems such as de velopmental delays in children, skin disease, headaches, asthma, and other res piratory conditions. Additional ly, the County supports efforts to rehabilitate existing housing, without placing the financial burden on lowi ncome tenants and homeowners, and develop new housing, located at a safe distance from polluting sources, such as freeways, ports and businesses with toxic emissions, particularly for lowincome communities of col or and vulnerable populations, and when not possible, ensuring appropriate indoor and outdoor mitigations a re put in place. The County supports housing preservation/rehabilitation through increased efforts to inspec t rental properties through strategies such as proactive rental inspection programs. The County supports effor ts to assist lowincome landlords and elderly property owners to maintain their properties. Preventing and ending homelessness, and assisting people curren tly homeless . Higher funding levels and increased coordination between funding for services and housing are needed to create and sustain supportive housing for the highest need individuals and families who are h omeless. The County supports increases to funding and coordination to address the needs of people who are currently homeless, especially those most vulnerable and living on the streets and in places unfit for hu man habitation. Responses to unsheltered homelessness and public encampmen ts include immediate efforts t o expand, improve and coordinate street outreach and access to basic need s; midterm strategies such as establishing lowbarrier transitional housing and bridge communities; and ulti mately investment in more housi ng for extremely lowincome individuals. Affordable and supportive housing are critical to preventing an d ending homelessness and cost the same or less than shelter, incarceration, hospitalization and other cri sis response interventions. P r o t e c t i n g h o m e o w n e r s f r o m f o r e c l o s u r e a n d t h e r i g h t s o f t e n a n t s living in foreclosed properties. Communities and neighborhoods in the County are still suffering the effects of high foreclosure rates and resident displacement. The County supports legislative efforts to increase funding and prevent foreclosures and ameliorate their impacts. Removing barriers to accessing housing. The County supports antidiscrimination policies that prevent landlords from discriminating against housing vouchers and that prevent adverse housing decisions based on a person's status as former incarc erated or immigration status. Prevent displacement of community residents. Involuntary displacement of longterm residents is a continuing problem in the County's highcost housing market. Th e County supports polic y and funding efforts to limit and ameliorate resident displacement. The County suppo rts tenant rights and protections to prevent displacement such as antiharassment policies, rent stabilizati on, and just cause eviction ordinances. Alameda County State Legislative Priorities 2018 PAGE | 83 COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT To create more livable and econo mically vibrant communities for everyone, the County supports the following policies: Access to open space. An increase in funding for and access to safe and quality parks , trails, green and open space, urban agriculture/community gardens, and recreation cent ers. Policies should ensure that these opportunities are made available in all communities. A person's neighborhood shapes their opportunities to play, exercise, enjoy nature, and be healthy. Accessible communities. Promote the use of universal design to ensure accessibility of spaces for every one of all abilities. Communities that are designed to be accessibl e to seniors, children, and people with disabilities will be accessible for everyone. This includes street and sidew alk design, as well as wheelchair accessible public spaces such as parks and communi ty centers, lighting, and other safety issues. Prioritizing reinvestment in lowincome communities. Increased funding and the creation of funding tools, such as tax increment financing, developer incentives, and Gree nhouse Gas Reduction Funds that local jurisdictions can use to increase affordable housing, and affor dable and reliable transi t and infrastructure in their communities. The elimination of redevelopment revenues gr eatly reduced sources of funding to invest in lowincome and blighted communities. This funding should priori tize the needs and prevent displacement of existing residents. Regional planning efforts. Additional resources to promote the greenhouse gas reduction go als of the Sustainable Communities Strategy (SCS), including policies, inv estments and programs that promote walk ability, transit, infill development, housing near transit with out increasing the risk of exposure to pollution or displacement of current residents, particularly for lowincome communities and vulnerable populations, increasing affordable housing production, urban greening networ ks throughout the County, and the conservation of irrigated agricultural land. The SCS goals of c ompact, infill development should be supported at the State level with additional funding for housing, transit an d public infrastructure. Incentives for smart growth development. Additional resources to promote smart growth as a corollary to regional and local planning effor ts. The loss of Redevelopment funding has made it more difficult to attract development to Priority Development Areas (PDAs) - the communit y building blocks that make up the SCS. The County supports the creation of resources to create a PDA \"bank \" at the regional level and other resources to attract smart growth development , especially to areas that suff er from economic neglect and lowincome communities. SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT Urban Density. Support policies and legislation that p romote dense affordable housing development, especially along transit corridors, adjacent to transit hubs, a nd near employment centers. This includes updating zoning codes to support dense mixeduse developments, transitoriented development (TOD), promoting upzoning, infill housing development, and auxiliary dwelling units. Preparing for Climate Impacts. Support policies and funding for climate adaptation and resilie nce planning, specifically implementation for retrofitting and building out i nfrastructure, reduction of urban heat island effects, and reducing other climate impacts on health and the e nvironment including flooding and sea level rise. Regional Planning for Housing. Support regional cooperation for all jurisdictions to meet the housing goals as set forth in the Regional Housing Needs Assessment, and supp ort innovative programs, such as a regional affordable housing bank for priority development areas. Equity & Environmental Justice. Support policies that grow sustai nable and equitable communitie s by creating new housing that is hea lthy and affordable, transitor iented, and near jobs, while preventing and minimizing the impacts of displa cement of lowincome communitie s and vulnerable populations. Climate Adaptation. Support funding and legislation that advances the use of natura l vegetation to adapt to rising seas, manages flooding, prepares for drought, and reduce s the impact that urban areas have on the Alameda County State Legislative Priorities 2018 PAGE | 84 environment, including, but not limited to, restoring natural w etlands, designing for onsite storm water treatment, and promoting urban f orests, native plants, and natu ral landscapes. Urban Greening In conjunction with Regional Age ncies leading the implementatio n of SB 375, support the development of a comprehensive u rban greening (\"Planning Conser vation Area\") network throughout the County with particular emphasis o n connections to disadvantaged communities which will integrate with and complement the planned Priority D evelopment Areas and smart gro wth transit corridors. PUBLIC SAFETY DISTRICT ATTORNEY The District Attorney's Office is responsible for the prosecuti on of crimes in the County of Alameda, California. The Office is dedicated to serving the community through the ethica l prosecution of criminal offenses and the vigorous protection of victims' rights. The District Attorney's Office s upports policies and legislatio n on the following: Human Exploitation and Trafficking (H.E.A.T.). Funding for the Human Exploitation and Trafficking (H.E.A.T.) Watch to enhance services to victims of human trafficking and c ommercially sexually exploited minors. To combat human trafficking, this program requires funds to educat e the community, provide effective community outreach and train law enforcement. Stronger legislat ion is needed to prosecute human traffickers, as well as expand serv ices and resources for victims of sex tra fficking and labor trafficking. DNA Backlog. DNA evidence can be used to eliminate or confirm suspects, deve lop investigative leads to solve a number of unsolved cases, and exonerate the innocent. F unding to eliminate the current backlog of untested sexual assault kits, solidifying a partnership between o u r o f f i c e , l a w e n f o r c e m e n t a g e n c i e s , a n d private entities to provide a streamlined model throughout the State to prevent future backlogs. Victims of Crime. Enhancement of the rights and protections of all victims of cri me, and increased funding to expand services to all victims, especially those of violent cri me including: homicide, child abuse, domestic violence, sexual assault, stalking, human trafficking, and comm ercially exploited minor s. Increase funding to aggressively collect restitution of behalf of all victims of cr ime. Strengthen the process for seeking and securing restitution for victims of crime. Mental Health. Advocate for strong funding stre ams for treating and assisting people with mental health issues. Realignment. Reduce recidivism by realigning lower level offenders to commun ity corrections programs strengthened through communitybased punishment, improved super vision strategies and evidencebased practices, and supervision practices demonstrated by research t o reduce recidivism. This includes employing proven alternatives to incarcera tion for lowrisk offenders. In addition, systemic reforms in the Alameda County court system are required to est ablish a centralized process to help in filing revocation petitions. Reducing Serious/Violent Crimes. Initiatives to reduce violent crimes by proposing the formation of the regional multiagency task force to combat violence. The task f orce would provide meaningful alternatives to individuals engaged in criminal behavior who are amenable to va rious treatment strategies. Enhancing CommunityBased Support for Formerly Incarcerated. Support funding for community programs that aid incarcerated and formerly incarcerated individuals thr ough their rehabilitation efforts and process. Funding can provide programs for individuals as an alternative to incarceration or thro ugh the expansion of District Attorney driven Diversion Programs wherein charges are dismissed after successful completion of the Program. Funding can provide programs and support for individua ls under supervision of the Probation Department following conviction as well as for individuals afte r they return from jail or prison. Community programs include access to health care, job training and educat ion to provide tools to support themselves and reduce recidivism. Alameda County State Legislative Priorities 2018 PAGE | 85 Youth Empowerment and Juvenile Delinquency Prevention. More programs and funding for youth to provide work experience so that youth can gain realworld skill s and experience to help them become self sufficient in a positive way and prevent them from entering the juvenile and/or criminal justice systems. Stronger intervention and prevention programs for commercially exploited minors as well as funding for resources for minors and transitioning youth who have been vict ims of human trafficking and/or sexual exploitation. Youth Violence Prevention and Education Programs. Funding for violence prevention and education programs and/or counseling programs for youth who are at risk o f or have been involved in crime to provide information about the ju venile justice system; teach ab out healthy relationships and decision making, and assist youth to achieve their dreams. Also more par tnerships with additional groups to provide counseling, mentorship, case management, life skills, e mployment and training. Alternative Programs to Incarceration. Advocate for continued funding for programs seeking alternative s to incarceration. Enhancing Public Safety. Evaluate and propose changes in the law that protect innocent b ystanders and children from mutual gun combat. Consumer Protection, Environmental Protection, and Worker Prote ction. Increase efforts in consumer protection, environmental protection, and worker protection, pa rticularly around l abor trafficking. Collaboration. A d v o c a t e f o r a n d c r e a t e a l e g i s l a t i v e p l a t f o r m t o r e q u i r e c o u n t y agencies to work with community agencies collaboratively to combat human trafficking, specifically the sex trafficking of minors as well as labor trafficking. PROBATION The Alameda County Probation Department provides adult and juve nile clients with the treatment, supervision and support necessary to prevent reoffending, while enhancing public safety and reducing victimization. Through the use of innovative strategies and the engagement of our gove rnment and community partners, we maintain a \"layered approach\" to providing support to our clients and thei r families. Partnerships include crossjurisdictional collaborations with Federal, State and County agencies, communi ty and faithbased organiz ations, therapists, and social workers. The Probation Department supports policies and legislation on t he following: Eliminate Racial Disparities. Elimination of disparities among boys and men of color which le ad to their disproportionate representation in the juvenile justice system. Commitment to Vulnerable Youth and Families. Commitment to serving vulnerable youth and families and reducing the number of youth cross ing over between the child we lfare and juvenile justice systems. Expand and Build Support Services and Improve Systems Change un der Title IVE. Expand and build support services aimed at improving system changes that meet the identi fied Title IVE goals, to include reducing the number of youth in outofhome placements, providing the least restrictive level of placement when outof home placement is necessary, and promoting family preservation and family reunification services. Improve Supervision Strategies. Continue to improve supervision strategies using Smart Supervis ion to better identify, superv ise and treat highrisk/highneeds clien ts. The Smart Supervision Program provides grants and assistance to states, units of local government, and federally recognized Indian tribes to develop and implement more effective and evidencebased probation and parol e practices that effectively address individuals' needs and reduce recidivism Improve Probation Success Rates. Continue to improve probation su ccess rates, thereby increasing public safety, reducing victimization, a dmissions to prisons and jails , and saving taxpayer dollars. Commitment to Criminal Justice Reform. Continued commitment to realignment and reentry efforts within juvenile and adult areas. Provide evidencebased detention alte rnatives for adults designed to restore them to the community. Alameda County State Legislative Priorities 2018 PAGE | 86 Utilization of EvidenceBased Practices. By incorporating practices and p rogramming that have been prove n to reduce recidivism through empirical data, we reduce victimiz ation and costs associated with the criminal justice system, and the longterm integration of clients into o ur communities. Caseload Sizes Based Upon American Probation and Parole Associa tion (APPA) Industry Standards: Youth and adult caseloads should be ri ght sized in accordance with AP PA industry standards. Such a shift would enable probation officers to devote the appropriate amount of t ime to providing clients with quality supervision and management, to include assessing client needs, case planning, program referrals, followup, engagement, counseling, treatment, intermediate sanctions, etc. Without a more balanced and evidence based approach to the management of adult clients, probation of ficers are limited in the quality of the service and follow up services provided to adult clients and th eir families. Increased Funding to Support the Advent of Higher Risk Clients into the County's Probation System: The passage of legislation redirecting adults and youth, with more serious backgrounds, to the County has resulted in the need for increased services at the local level. The funding funneled to t he Counties in response to this legislation ( i.e., AB 109, Proposition 47) is in sufficient to meet the public s afety needs of the County. Increased Funding to Support Prevention and Intervention Servic es for At Risk Clients, Adult and Youth: Insufficient funding exists to identify and service youth and a dults before they come to the attention of the criminal justice system.. By proactively integrating preven tion and intervention services and strategies within the highest risk communiti es, the State and the County c an reduce its reliance on the criminal justice system by addressing precursors that lead to criminality, i.e., substance abuse, mental health, family dysfunction, gangs, truancy. Increased Funding to Support the Family Unit: The dysfunction of the family unit contributes in immeasurable ways to human suffe ring, victimization and the cri minal justice system. The County supports services and programming (parenting classes, anger management, family cohesion) to identify and service the most atrisk families in our communities. Such funding is an \"u pfront\" investment in the quality of life for our residents through the prevention of issues that, if left unaddr essed, have the potential to lead to criminality, homelessness, poverty, mental health issues, etc. CrossDepartmental Data System : Most adult and youth clients are provided services by State a nd County Departments before they come to the attention of the criminal j ustice system, to include Probation. The development of a statewide cross departmental data system will enable state and local agencies to share information about clients that will facilitate each Department' s ability to more comprehensively service the i n d i v i d u a l a n d / o r t h e e n t i r e f a m i l y . T h e a b s e n c e o f c o l l a b o r a t i o n a m o n g d i f f e r e n t a g e n c i e s , t h r o u g h a comprehensive data source, resul ts in missed opportunities to i mprove the wellbeing of our clients and to reduce their involvement with multiple systems, i.e., health services, mental health, children and family services, law enforcement, schools. Statewide Data Integrated System Research Department : Funding should be provided to create County Research Departments to enable j urisdictions to synthesize the data elements from the \"statewide cross departmental data systems\" (see bullet above). This will enable Counties to determine outcomes, measure program effectiveness, evaluate approaches and make datainform ed decisions on the best manner in which to utilize resources. Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children (CSEC) : Insufficient resources exist to prevent, identify, and service young victims of sexual exploitation. The longterm imp act of this victimization can contribute to PTSD, impair cognitive functioning, create numerous physical and ment al health issues, homelessness, contribute to poverty and poor interpersonal relationships, etc. The County a lso supports strengthenin g existing legislation to increase penalties fo r traffickers and pimps. Mental Health Treatment & Community Resources : The County supports a marked increase in resources to provide residential and outpatient services to those suffering from mental health disorders. The closure of State mental hospitals and the lack of community resources to s ervice this population has contributed to an increase in those coming to the attention of the criminal justi ce system, homelessness, emergency room hospital use, etc. as a result o f the deterioration of those wi th the most critical needs. Alameda County State Legislative Priorities 2018 PAGE | 87 Security of Data Housed in the Government Cloud: Currently many County Departments host their data on servers that are located on premises. This type of data storage is a traditional system that has been replaced by \"Cloud Computer\" storage systems because of enhanced security a nd reduced costs. By storing automated databases in the Cloud, a County can: (1) save a significant am ount of funds with unlimited storage capacity, (2) rely on updates that are installed immediately versus sending o ut updates to the users' computers, (3) connect to other secured government databases, and (4) increase overall security of the data. Alameda County supports funding to increase the County's storage of data in th e Cloud, through the State Department of Justice. Pretrial Services. Probation will lead the pretrial service program in collaborat ion with our public safety agency partners. A robust evidencebased risk and needs assessm ent tool will be utilized to determine a client's eligibility for release, while also addressing the saf ety needs of the communi ty. Dedicated 2011 Public Safety Realignment funds, pursua nt to AB 109, will be utilized to support the pretrial infrastructure and service needs of its pretrial clients. PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE The Public Defende r's Office supports: Protecting and expanding the right s to liberty, privacy, and du e process. Protecting all members of the community from unreasonabl e search, seizure, arrest, detention, and surveillance. Preserving and expanding the right to a fair trial. Strengthening Evidence Code requirements concerning the compete ncy and trustworthin ess of evidence to be introduced at trial. Diversion programs and other programs designed to prevent peopl e from coming into the criminal justice system. The decriminalization of nonviolent drug possession offenses a nd a shift of resources from incarceration and criminalization to treatment a nd harmreduction practices. Sentencing reform aimed at reducing jail and prison populations , eliminating disproportional sentences, and promoting more just outcomes for those convicted of crimes. Removing barriers to successful reintegration of people into communities after incarceration, such as unnecessary barriers to education, employment, housing, and hea lth and social services. Increasing funding for criminal defense investigation, the rete ntion of experts, and the litigation of complex and/or particularly sensitive cases. Programs designed for rehabilitation, the restoration of rights , and the expungement of criminal records. Increasing the availability of rehabilitation services both for incustody defendants and those who have been released from custody. Initiatives to promote effective, ethical, and accountable poli ce and law enforcement agencies. Specifically, instituting nonsuggestive policies regarding identification pr ocedures, such as doubleblind photo lineups. Increasing treatment program fundi ng for drug and alcohol abuse . Increasing the funding for mental health treatment programs. Pr omoting ways to divert those with mental illness out of the criminal justice system. Reducing the number of people under supervision by the courts, state, and/or County by agencies including parole and probation. Providing effective health care services to all those incarcera ted at either the state or county level. Providing social services to impoverished communities, pa rticularly those aimed at preventing criminal behavior, including recidivism. Policies promoting t he health and welfare of indigent clients. Principles of Restorative Justice and policies designed to impl ement those principles. Alameda County State Legislative Priorities 2018 PAGE | 88 Initiatives promoting racial justice at all levels of the crimi nal justice system. Sources of additional sustainabl e funding for any of the forego ing programs and policies. HEALTH AND PUBLIC SAFETY Alameda County supports budgetary and legislative actions that address root causes of all forms of violence, improve public safety, shift resources from incarceration to pr evention, and benefit communities disproportionately affected by violence, including lowincome c ommunities, communities of color and people with disabilities. Alameda County is c ommitted to pursuing solutions that recognize the impact of mental health, drug use, and poverty on those involved in or at risk of involvement in the criminal justice system. Alameda County opposes legislation that focuses on suppression strategies that do not ameliorate root causes and risk factors unless they are balanced by primary prevention support. Alameda County defines violence as intimate partner violence, f amily violence, gun violence, gang violence, suicide and homicide, commercia l sexual exploitation of minors, youth v iolence, hate violence, sexual assault, child and elder abuse, as well as other forms of violence. Alameda County defines public safety as efforts that promote crime prevention and reduction, positive communitylaw enforcem ent relationships and collaboration, nonviolent conflict resolution, restorative justice, successful reintegrat ion of people with criminal convictions into communities, living wage jobs, e ducational opportunities, affor dable housing, and protection of all community members' civil rights. Violence is an issue that impacts all sectors of our community, but it disproportionately impacts lowincome communities, communities of colo r and people with disabilities, and as a result, resources and legislation for preventing violence and protecting public safety should priorit ize these communities. Per the Department of Justice, the number of violent crimes in Alameda County has dec reased steadily between 2012 and 2016, with a slight uptick in crimes from 20152016. The following policies are recommended to improve the public sa fety and health of the community: Decrease risk factors and increase resiliency factors for youth and families: Alameda County supports legislation and funding that supports resiliency building strat egies, including expanding child and youth development programs that emphasize strong attachments and rela tionships and violence prevention skills, as well as provide an alternative to gang involvement. Legislation and programs focused on gang reduction should address the root causes and should not rely solely on suppressi on. Additionally, Alameda County supports actions that promote family wellbeing, including efforts that help families meet basic needs, as well as develop effective parenting and conflic t resolution techniques that hel p prevent child abuse and domestic violence. Foster thriving neighborhoods: the County supports legislation and funding that supports impro ving neighborhood conditions, including policies that decrease densi ty of alcohol outlets and advertising and improve the physical appearance and economic vibrancy. Such pol icies could include efforts to ensure government subsidized capital inv estments and infrastructure pr ojects benefit highcrime neighborhoods. Additionally, Alameda County sho uld pursue legislation that ens ures that public safety funds can be used flexibly and can support building community cohesiveness for co llective problem solving. Alameda County supports policies that promote evidencebased traumainformed c are. Improve communitylaw enforcement relationships: Alameda County supports legislation and funding for strategies that strengthen comm unitylaw enforcement relationsh ips such as community policing, crisis intervention training for 1st responders, and mandatory trainings like those offered by the C alifornia Commission on Peace Officer Standards and Training (POST). Trai ning topics should include deescalation skills, increased police awareness of con scious and unconscious bias an d how to account for it in the line of duty, and appropriate police response to persons with mental illness or d evelopmental disability, w hich will help to avoid additional violence and/or inappropriate admission into the cri minal justice system. Alameda County supports the collection of data to determine the effectiveness of public safety methods and interventions for accountability to Alameda County residents. Alameda County State Legislative Priorities 2018 PAGE | 89 Eliminate the disproportionate representation of people of colo r and people with disabilities in the criminal justice system and as victims of violence: Alameda County supports administrative, legislative and budgetary actions with the explicit goal of eliminating the ove rrepresentation of people of color and people with disabilities in the criminal justice system. Efforts inclu de reviewing systems for their contributions toward issues of \"disproportionate mino rity contact,\" identifying and addressing issues related to sentencing bias, and acknowledging and mitigating unc onscious bias within the crimin al justice system overall. Support alternatives to incarceration including sentencing refo rm, and decriminalization of substance use disorders and other criminal justice reforms as a way to reduce recidivism and shrink the prison population. R e m o v e b a r r i e r s t o s u c c e s s f u l r e i n t e g r a t i o n o f p e o p l e i n t o c o m m u n i t i e s a f t e r i n c a r c e r a t i o n , s u c h a s barriers to education, employment, housing, and health and soci al services: Alameda County encourages the State Attorney General and the State legislature to direct appr opriate agencies and licensing bodies to review exis ting policies ' impact on previous ly incarcerated people and to reform policies that prevent successful reentry and do not serve to protect public safety, with a focus on agencies and programs related to education, employment, housing, and public assistance. Furthermore, Alamed a County supports legislation that provides incentives for hiring formerly incarcerated persons and efforts that provide amnesty to the more than 4 million people in California who have a suspended license, mostly for u npaid fines; living without a license is a significant barrier to employment and transportation. Driving w ith a suspended license is grounds for a misdemeanor charge in California, \"even if the sole reason for the suspension is an inabi lity to pay a citation fine\". (Source: http://ebclc.org/backontheroad/problem/ ) Expand health and social services for the incarcerated and form erly incarcerated population: Alameda County supports legislation that funds expanded rehabilitation programs and mandates and funds comprehensive reentry planning i n jails and prisons so as to su pport successful reentry. Alameda County also supports the expansion of funding for physical and mental healt h services, substance use treatment, housing, education, job training and employment services, including coor dination of care both during incarceration and post release. Alameda County suppo rts legislation that ensures that jail and prison conditions do not contribute to worsening mental health, incl uding the elimination of solita ry confinement as a punishment for both youth and adults and making maintaining family connections during inc arceration a priority. Reduce the availability and usage of firearms : Between 2012 and 2014, the t hird greatest number of unintentional injuries was due to firearms (healthyalamedacount y.org). Alameda County supports continued statewide efforts to strengthen gun laws and expand gun buybac k programs, as well as encourages California to play a very active role in federal gun reforms, as Californi a residents are at risk as long as highpower weapons with large magazines are sold in other states. Ensure state funding for local domestic violence services and i ncrease federal support for domestic violence victims: Alameda County supports efforts t o secure and expand domestic v iolence prevention dollars \"for emergency shelter and other essential victim services\", po licies that support victims' ability \"to obtain a restraining order, navigate divorce and custody proceedings, ha ve meaningful language access and interpretation services in civil court,\" \"provide free court re porters in domestic violence family law proceedings\", and promote efforts to enforce restraining orders . The County supports \"systemchange efforts encouraging schools to adopt and implement school policies to a ddress adolescent dating abuse\" and the County supports efforts to address \"the needs of traditionally underserved or unserved communities, including populations underserved because of geographic location, religio n, sexual orientation, gender identity\", race, ethnicity, and \"populations underserved because of special need s such as language barriers, disabilities, alienage status or age.\" Lastly, the County supports efforts to address the economic concerns that domestic violence survivors often face that lead them to \"return to abus ive relationships\": \"safe and affordable housing; the ability to work and earn a fair and livable wage; and acces s to public benefits that meet the basic needs of recipients.\" (From the CA Partnership to End Domestic Violence: http://www.cpedv.org/policypriorities ) Alameda County State Legislative Priorities 2018 PAGE | 90 SUSTAINABILITY, CLIMA TE CHANGE, AND ENERGY OPENING Creating a healthy and sustainable Alameda County today and for future generations is a key cornerstone of the County's Strategic Vision.

TRANSPORTATION TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE Adequate funding is critical to both ongoing maintenance of and improvements to the transportation infrastructure to provide safe and convenient travel along and across streets for all users, including motorists, emergency vehicles, pedestrians, bicyclists, public transportat ion and freight and comme rcial goods movement. In April 2017, the legislature and Governor enacted the Road Re pair and Accountability Act of 2017 (SB 1) a long sought robust, multimodal and comprehensive transportation fu nding package. Once fully implemented, California counties will sha re approximately $750 million annua l l y f o r l o c a l s t r e e t s a n d r o a d s m a i n t e n a n c e , rehabilitation. SB 1 also provides opportunities to compete for grants in the active transportation, planning, and congestion relief programs. Alameda County State Legislative Priorities 2018 PAGE | 93 While this is good news for the immediate future, with the shif t from fossil fuel vehicles to clean energy, it will be necessary to identify an ongoing, sustainable revenue source th a t i s n ' t r e l i a n t o n f o s s i l f u e l c o n s u m p t i o n . Transportation funding should move California toward an alluse rs pay structure, in which everyone who benefits from the system contributes to maintaining it - including tradi tional gasolinefueled vehicles, new hybrids or electric vehicles and/or commercial vehicles. The County supports policie s and legislation that: Invest in transportation infrastructure. With increasing fuel efficiency and the introduction of hybrid and electric vehicles, revenues from the gas tax, the primary sourc e of transportation infr astructure maintenance and project delivery, are expected to continue to decline. Supp ort legislation that provide alternative methods of increasing transportation revenues through a variety of sour ces including, but not limited to, fuel taxes, Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) fees and Vehicle License Fees (VLF ). Support legislation and regulations that promote complete streets that p rovide access for all users rega rdless of age, ability, or transportation mode through development of bicycle, pedestrian and transit faciliti es. Develop autonomous vehicles (AVs) and emerging technology polic ies. Technological advancements, including autonomous vehicles (AV ) and associated infrastructur e, are rapidly changing. Support the development of critical policies to ensure the effective deploy ment and safe operation of AVs on public transportation infrastructure. Support policies and legislation which provide specific parameters which ensure the safety of AVs in ways that enhance the benefits for all con stituents. Support comprehensive policies which consider the implications and impacts of automat ion on the local transpo rtation infrastructure. Enhance Active Transportation Programs. Active transportation projects, which encourage greater mobilit y through walking and bicycling, h ave grown in popularity due to the numerous benefits to the community, including reducing air pollution in the community and improving physical and mental health. Support legislation, policies and funding for the desig n and construction of sidewal k infrastructure, bicycle facilities and other infrastructure improvements which enable all pedestrian and bic yclists to travel safely and efficiently. ONGOING FUNDING FOR I580 CO RRIDOR IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS The I580 corridor in the TriValley is one of the most traffic congested locations in the Bay Area region. It serves as a key interregional gateway between the Bay Area and the Centr al Valley for goods movement and workforce commute travel. Although it has dropped out of the Top 10, this chronic condition has resulted in multiple locations along I580 still being in the Top 50 most congested Bay Area corridors, as identified in the annual report jointly published by Caltrans and the Metropolitan Transportati on Commission (MTC). This congestion will worsen as traffic volumes in this corri dor are projected to increase 9 0 percent by 2030. To respond to the existing and projected congestion, Alameda Co unty Transportation Commission (Alameda CTC) has identified a series of planned improvements for this corrid or. Over the years, a number of these improvements have been implemented, including t he construction of both eastb ound and westbound HOT lanes, and a new interchange at Isabel/SR 84 in Livermore. Other improvements in clude the completion of the auxiliary lane system and an eastbound truck climbing lane. Projects in the planning stage include the reconstru ction of the existing I 580/I680 interchange, and a BART connection to the Altamont Co mmuter Express (ACE) interregional passenger rail. Additionally, in October 2017, AB 758 established the Tri ValleySan Joaquin Valley Regional Rail Authority for purposes of planning, developing, and delivering costeffective and responsive transit connectivity between the BART's rapid transit system and the Altamont Commuter Express ( ACE) commuter rail servi ces in the TriValley. Alameda County continues its s upport of ongoing funding for the I580 corridor improvements. Alameda County State Legislative Priorities 2018 PAGE | 94 RURAL ROAD SAFETY Alameda County is a primary dest ination for regional and inter regional traffic for goods movement and workforce commute travel between San Joaqui n County, Contra Costa County and Santa Clara County. Major transportation corridors in this region routinely experience extreme traffic c ongestion. In an effort to avoid these congested freeways, commuters continue to seek alternative routes along t he rural roads. As a result, many of Alameda County's rural roadways are now being used by commuters attempt ing to bypass the heavily congested I580 and I680 corridors. On these rural roadways, traffic volumes durin g peak hour may be 100 times greater than the traffic volume during nonpeak hour. The increased traffic cong estion and aggressive behavior by many commuters (speeding, unsafe passing, etc.) results in safety is sues, especially for the residents living along these rural roadways. The County supports policie s and legislation that: Increase rural road safety. Support legislation that increases safety on the existing trans portation system, with emphasis on programs/projects focused to improve safety an d reduce accidents and fatalities. Increase funding for enforcement. Support increased funding for public protection and enforcement of existing traffic safety codes, ordinances, and laws. SUSTAINABLE TRANSPORTATION Throughout California, transportation agencies are taking innov ative actions to combat climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and toxic air pollution from transport ation. Some of the sustainable goals include improving the durability of construction materials, improving m obility with new traffic control devices, and supporting the transition towards zeroemission vehicles. Addit ional efforts are being made to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and toxic air pollu tion by reducing traffic conge stion, expanding active transportation (multimodal trails, pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure), embracing new t echnology in construction materials and efficient roadway lighting. The County supports policie s and legislation that: Reduce greenhouse gas emissions . Support legislation that provi des funding for innovative infr astructure, o p e r a t i o n s a n d p r o g r a m s t o r e l i e ve congestion, improves air qua lity, reduces emissions, and supports economic development. Support public transit. Support policies and funding that expand and improve the availa bility, reliability, affordability, and accessibility of modern public transit syste ms. Supports policies and funding to improve regional collaboration and cooperation on transit improvements and consolidation of systems and programs. Supports policies for t he development of local and highspeed r ail networks to provide additional travel alternatives. Expand partnerships.

Fossil fuel vehicles are significant contributors to greenhouse gases and toxic air pollution. Transportation polici es and funding should support all modes and all users to ensure the longterm effectiveness in reducing greenho use gases and improving overall health. Use of public transit instead of singleoccupant vehicles reduc es greenhouse gas emissions, reduces the number of vehicle miles driven, and encourages walking and biking, which helps to make an impact on health outcomes, including the obesity epidemic. Access to affordable and relia ble public transit is particularly vital to access economic opportunities, to get to jobs and schools, and to prom ote health for all communities, especially youth, seniors, and people with disabilities. People will more likely avoid car trips and have more access to job opportunities when homes, jobs, and services are placed close a ccessible and affordable public transit options. This, in turn, provides a reliable customer base for public tra nsit systems. The County supports policie s and legislation that: Sustain and prioritize increased funding for public transit. Support funding to increase the accessibility, reliability, and affordability of public transit options, parti cularly local buses, as well as improve connectivity to regional rail systems. Support flexible funding for public tra n s i t s o t h a t t h e y c a n b e u s e d f o r m o b i l i t y management and other needs. Sustainable transportation infrastructure. Support funding and policies and funding that promote sustainable transportation systems that expand and improve the availability, reliability, affordability, and accessibility of modern public transit systems. Support policie s and provide funding to improve regional collaboration and cooperation on transit improvements and conso lidation of systems and programs. Support policies for the development of local and highspeed rail netwo rks to provide additiona l travel alternatives. Prioritize funding for lowincome and transitdependent populat ions. Mobility management is a strategic, costeffective approach to encour age the development of service s and best practices in the coordination of public transportation services connecting people needing transp ortation to available transportation resources within a community. Support increased public transit funding an d prioritize uses which benefit lowincome populations and transit dependent populations, such as seniors, youth and people with disabilities, including maintaining and improving local transit service levels, improvi ng affordability through free and reduced fare programs. Support the coordinatio n of alternative transportatio n options as part of a mobility management strategy. Support the inclusion of lowincome communities and t ransitdependent populations in transportation policy decisionmaking. Prioritize transitoriented development over urban sprawl. Support policies and legislation that increase housing density and infill in urban areas, rather than developi n g e x i s t i n g o p e n o r a g r i c u l t u r a l s p a c e s i n suburban and rural areas. Support smart growth parking strategi es and locating housing and jobs near rail and bus lines. Support increasing housing and transit affordability for lowincome communities and the inclusion of antidisplacement provisions and protections in transitoriente d development projects, in order to support the ability of existing residents to stay and benefit from improvem ents in their neighborhoods. Sustain and prioritize greenhouse gas reduction goalsetting an d funds for vulnerable communities. Support policies and legislation which increases greenhouse gas reduction goals and support policies and funding that benefit health and wellbeing for communities faci ng environmental hazards, health burdens, high levels of neighborhood poverty and other vulnerabilities. Suppo rt policies that address pollution and safety impacts and other barriers to transit users, pedestrians and bi cyclists, particularly healthburdened and low income communities. Support prio ritizing transportation policie s and projects that have greater community benefits, such as livingwage jobs and zero emissions transport ation, than burdens for vulnerable communities and which minimize unintended co nsequences, such as displacemen t. Improve Partnerships. Support policies and provide funding to improve regional collab oration and cooperation on transit improvements and consolidation of system s and programs. Support policies for the development of local and highsp eed rail networks to provide ad ditional travel alternatives. Alameda County State Legislative Priorities 2018 PAGE | 96 GOODS MOVEMENT Alameda County is a gateway to the world for goods movement. It s airport, Oakland International, is one of three in the region. The Port of Oakla nd, the nation's 5th busiest co ntainer port, is one of three Pacific Coast gateways with maritime, rail and aviation freight activities. The Port o f Oakland is a key economic asset for Alameda County, the greater San Francisco Bay Region and neighboring regions. I t supports more than 73,000 jobs in the region and its activities are connected t o 827,000 jobs across the United States. As an intermodal operation, port activities impact regional and interregion al streets, rural roads and hig hway, rail corridors and waterways. Planning and implementation is underway for future expansion of the Port of Oakland to support its activities and for improvements to the transpor tation network system and, to f acilitate, Alameda CTC has worked to develop a Countywide Goods Movement Plan. The Commission approved the pla n in February 2016. The Plan also outlines a longrange strategy for how to move goods efficiently, reliably and sustainably within, to, from and through Alameda County by roads, rail, air and water. Because a substantial amount of good movement occurs on local s treets and roads throughout Alameda County, the plan also addresses impacts to transportation infrastructur e. Challenges faced on the local streets and roads include lack of truck route connectivity across city boundaries , providing safe access by all local streets and road users (autos, pedestrians, bicyclists and public transit) and c ut through traffic on rural roads to avoid congestion on major corridors. Additionally, truck traffic on local streets a nd rural roads designed to accommodate vehicles is resulting in pavement damage and impacting the livability and q uality of life for the residents living adjacent to these goods movement corridors. The County supports policie s and legislation that: Expand goods movement funding and policy development. Support the development of policies that preserve and strengthen an integrated and connected multimodal goods movement system, support freight mobility and access, and are coordinated with passenger transpo rtation systems and local land use decisions. Improve goods movement infrastructure. Support legislation, policies and funding to study, plan, fund and implement improvements for a safe, efficient, resilient and wel lmaintained goods movement facilities and corridors. Supports legislation, policies and funding to study, plan and design safety improvements along local streets and rural roads to accommodate the increasing goods mov ement traffic, including driveway consolidation for truck access t o wineries, leftturn pockets a nd truck deceleration lanes. Identify goods movement funding stream. Support identifying a funding stream for goods movements to maintain and impro ve the goods movement infrastructure. Prioritize Bay Area transportation systems. Support legislation and policies that prioritize the Bay Area transportation systems in both State and f ederal planning and f unding processes. Mitigate goods movement impacts. Support policies and programs th at reduce and mitigate impacts from goods movement operations, such as noise and air quality, to cr eate a healthy and clean environment and support improved qualityoflife for people most impacted by go ods movement. REGIONAL AND INTERREGIONAL PARTNERSHIPS AND PROJECTS With over 20 percent percent of the population, Alameda County experiences roughly 40 percent of the traffic congestion within the ninecounty San Francisco Bay Are a region. Intersected by numerous interregional highway corridors which serve as gateways into the region, Alam eda County has a robust transportation infrastructure, including local streets and roads, freight corr idors, express lane impl ementation, and transit systems. Through regional coordi nation and funding partnerships at all levels of government, significant investment to improve transporta tion infrastructure has occurre d countywide in recent years. Alameda County Alameda County State Legislative Priorities 2018 PAGE | 97 supports and encourages continued crossjurisdictional partners hips to deliver transportation projects and programs to its constituents. Since 1986, Alameda County and it s 14 cities have been recipients of a countywide, voterapproved sales tax measure dedicated to tran sportation investments throughout Alameda County. The County supports policie s and legislation that: Expand partnerships. Support efforts that encourage a nd promote regional and megare gional cooperation and coordination to develop, promote, and fund solutions to tra nsportation infrastructure improvement and support governmental efficiencies and cost savings in transport ation. This is essential to complete planning and development of important reg ional transportation projects t hat benefit the State and local road system, i n c l u d i n g V a s c o R o a d , T e s l a R o a d , G r e e n v i l l e R o a d , a n d P a t t e r s o n Pass Road in unincorporated Eastern Alameda County. Support efforts that encourage and facilitate t he establishment of publicprivate partnerships and lowcost financing strategies. Develop transportation policies. Support policy development to influence transportation planning , policy, and funding at the county, regiona l, State, and federal levels. Express/HOT (High Occupancy Toll) lane expansion. Support Express/HOT Lane expansion in Alameda County and the Bay Area. TRANSPORTATION REGULATORY AND PROJECT DELIVERY PROCESS The County takes its responsibility to protect our environment seriously. Likewise, the County recognizes its need to balance environmental protection and the need to maintain th e transportation infrast ructure through design, construction, and delivery of new transportation projects. Unfo rtunately, regulatory inefficiencies continue to hamper the effective and timely delivery of transportation proj ects. To this end, the County continues to seek legislative remedies in streamlining regulatory burdens while a dvocating for any and all funding opportunities at all levels of government. The County supports policies an d legislation that would: Improve the project delivery regulatory process. Support policies and legislation which streamline the project delivery proce sses for the delivery, enhancement, or au gmentation of transpor tation infrastructure projects and programs, including requiring specific time frames for State and federal reviews and approvals. Support policies and legislation to expedite project delivery w hile ensuring appropriate environmental protection and mitigation. Create reciprocity pilot program . Support the establishment of a Statefederal \"reciprocity\" pi lot program which allows the State of California and the local transportati o n a g e n c i e s t o c a r r y o u t t h e f e d e r a l environmental review processes to streamline and expedite deliv ery of federallyfunded projects. Support self certification policies among local transportation agencies. Regulatory exemptions. Support the categorical exemption of road safety projects from CEQA and State and federal permitting requirements (i.e., 404 permits, 1601 permit s) and exempt the maintenance of existing transportation facilities and infrastructure from permit requir ements under the Endangered Species Act. Mandate response times. Support policies and legislation which improve the environmenta l review and regulatory approval processes by mandating adherence to the res ponse time frames, schedules and deadlines specified in the environmental review process. Support policies and legislation that eliminates redundant documentation. Alameda County State Legislative Priorities 2018 PAGE | 98 FLOOD CONTROL AND WATER RESOURCES INCREASED FUNDING FOR FLOOD PROTECTION Continued protection from flooding and protecting natural resou rces in Alameda County requires legislative remedies, including increased funding for flood protection, lev ee repair and wetland restoration projects, and developing adaptive strategies t o climate change and sealevel rise. The County supports policie s and legislation that: Ensures consistency between State and federal definitions. The State Water Resources Control Board's proposed Wetland and Riparian Protection Policy includes differ ent terms and definitions of wetlands. Support legislation that would ensure co nsistency between State and fed eral definitions of wetlands and result in a reasonable requirement that will have the least impact on the d evelopment, operation, and maintenance of essential public works projects and facilities. Ensures levee funding. Support policies and legislation which identify additional fund ing sources and opportunities to ensure levee ma intenance, including repair and reconstruction after a flood event. Includes local flood control projects in voterapproved bonds. The State issues bonds to fund flood control projects throughout California, however, projects in Alameda Co unty have not been included. Support legislative changes which allow for the funding of local flood control projects by voterapproved bonds. Ensures climate change resiliency. Support State and federal funding to study, design, and impleme nt coastal flood protection solutio ns to protect Alameda County re sidents from effects of sea level rise and extreme tides due to climate change. Support establishing partn erships among local, State and federal agencies to promote protection from floods, climate change adap tation and resiliency. STREAMLINE THE REGULATORY AN D PROJECT DELIVERY PROCESS Regulatory inefficiencies conti nue to hamper the effective and timely delivery of flood control projects. Projects are bogged down by the multiple redundant and overlapping regul atory agency's approval processes, long time frames, and required reports and mitigation that do not add sig nificantly to improving the environment but rather result in costly project delivery costs. To this end, Alameda C ounty seeks legislative remedies to eliminate regulatory redundancies, streamlin e regulatory burdens and advo cate for funding support to adequate staffing levels at the local, State, and federal regulatory agencies. The County supports policie s and legislation that: Encourage service agreements. Support policies which allow and encourage State and federal re gulatory agencies to offer service agreements to public entity applicant s and permittees to fund additional personnel or contractors needed for expeditious permit processing. Mandated response timelines in review and approval process. Support policies and legislation which improve the environmental review and regulatory approval proces ses by mandating speci fic time frames for State reviews and approvals of permits to expedite project deli very while ensuring appropriate environmental protection and mitigation. Approve the CEQANEPA Reciprocity Pilot Program. Support the approval of the CEQANEPA Reciprocity Pilot Program, which build on California's successful implement ation of the Surface Transportation Project Delivery Program and allow for even greater project streamlinin g to enhance efficiency in flood control project delivery. Eliminate redundancy. Support policies and legislation which eliminate redundancy bet ween State agencies (such as Fish and Wildlife Services, Water Quality Control Boar d, and the Bay Coastal Development Commission) which create extensiv e delays in project delivery. Alameda County State Legislative Priorities 2018 PAGE | 99 Identify review process enhancements.

Support policies and legislation which streamline these processes. Encourage Partnerships. Support the establishment of loca l, State and federal partnersh ips among stakeholders focused on habitat restoration/resource protection including developing adaptive strategies to climate change and sea level rise. Alameda County State Legislative Priorities 2018 PAGE | 100 This page intentionally left blank PAGE | 101 Federal Legislative Priorities PAGE | 102 Alameda County Federal Legislative Priorities 2018 HUMAN SERVICES CREATE A HUMAN SERVICES SYSTEM T HAT IS RESPONSIVE TO COMMUNITY NEEDS Lowincome individuals and families need restoration of critica l benefits, increased flexibility, expansion of programs that work, services that are linguistically and cultur ally accessible, and the simplification/streamlining of processes and systems to ensure they are able to access all the benefits for which they are eligible. Alameda County supports public policies that preserve and strengthen th e social safety net for the most vulnerable while also advancing economic prosperity and equity so that all indiv iduals, children, and families have the opportunity to succeed. Better Facilitate Access to Benefits Streamline and integrate public assistance benefits enrollment. Support policies and systems that make it easier for individuals and families to have access to, apply fo r, utilize, retain, and recertify for benefits, including TANF (CalWORKs), SNAP (CalFresh), General Assistance, Medicaid (MediCal), and supportive services, including housing and childcare. Focus on Effective Impleme ntation and Staff Training Reasonable timelines and funding f or implementation of new poli cies/procedures. The federal government should work with stakeholders, including counties, w hen determining timelines and funding for rolling out new policies and procedures. Include training funding as part of new laws/changes. Standardize all new laws or changes that impact the practice of human services programs to include training funding . Resources to train staff are vital to successful implementation of program changes. Increase Access to Safe, Affordable Housing Options Protect and increase supports for affordable housing and homele ssness prevention. Support a range of policies and programs that prevent and resolve homelessness and housing instability. S upport evidencebased programs, including housing first, rapid rehousing, longterm housing subsidies, and models that include wrap around transitional housing and housing support services design ed to promote housing stability. Additionally, support polices to end housing discrimination based on race, et hnicity, sovereignty, national origin, immigration status, gender, sexual orientation/gender identity, age, disability status, and socioeconomic status. Protect and enhance supports and services for individuals and f amilies experiencing homelessness. Support funding and policies that ensure adequate emergency she lter and transitional housing. Investments in supportive housing result in the decreased use of homeless shel ters, hospitals, emergency rooms, jails, and prisons. Increase income guidelines for housing assistance. Support funding and policies that raise the income percentage restrictions for housing assistance. In Alameda Coun ty, the Fair Market annual rent for a two bedroom apartment is approxima tely $26,000. For individuals and families living below the Federal Poverty level housing is out of reach without housing support programs. Research shows that sta ble, safe housing is critical to one's wellbeing, health, and longterm success. For additional homelessness and housing priorities, please see the Planning, Land Use, and Housing and Community Development Chapter PAGE | 103 Alameda County Federal Legislative Priorities 2018 Early Care and Education Protect and increase access to quality early care and education for eligible families. Support funding, policies, and systems which create and expand equal access to s table, high quality early care and education programs for vulnerable families including children and youth i n foster care, families that are undocumented, or experiencing homelessness, a nd children with special needs. Streamline systems, where possibl e, to ease navigation and endu re a continuum of quality childcare that is culturally and developmentally appropriate. Enact and support policies which ease navigation of resources available for childcare and support family engagement. Reduce barriers to public and private collaboration to strength en childcare systems to more effectively and efficiently meet the needs of vulnerable children and famil ies. Support policies and programs that help parents make informed choices an d access information to support child development. Achieve Racial Equity and Adva nce Opportunities for All Protect and support public policies and practices that eliminat e racial disparities and ensure equitable opportunities and better futures for all Alameda County residen ts. Policies and practices should promote equity and reduce disparities based on race, ethnicity, soverei gnty, national origin, immigration status, gender, sexual orientation/gender identi ty, age, disability status, and socioeconomic status. Policies should address all forms of racism, particularly institutional and structural raci sm, which have played a central role historically and currently in creating and perpetuating persistent social and he alth inequities. Promote Economic Stability and Wealth Building Asset building policies and progra ms include a range of opportu nities including matchedsaving accounts, homeownership assistance, financial education, free tax prepara tion, access to affordable financial services, and credit building products and services. Broadening savings and a sset ownership opportunities will help move families and individuals from ju st breaking even to actually ge tting ahead. Remove asset limits for public assistance benefits. Asset limits create disincentives for lowincome families to save money for emergencies. Policies should promote savings and ensure individuals and families do not have to spend down any cushion t hey have before qualifying for public assistance. Maintain and expand savings programs. Policies should help lowincome individuals and families accumu late assets through increased savings and investments. Support a var iety of savings accounts and incentive programs that are designed to help lowincome individuals build assets and opportunities (such as Individual Development Accounts (IDAs), Children's Savings Accounts, Achie ving a Better Life Experience (ABLE) Accounts, and retirement accounts). Restrict payday lending and other predatory financial products and services. Support policies that protect consumers from predatory credit products, specifically by prohi biting, or capping rates on, payday loans and promoting lowcost, consumer friendly alternatives. Expand the presence of mainstream financial institutions in und erserved communities. Many neighborhoods lack access to mainstream financial institutions and instead rely on predatory lenders, such as check cashers, payday lenders, and pawn shops that drain millio ns of dollars from communities through high fees and usurious loans. Support efforts to encourage safe, aff ordable financial products that protect income and assets. Expand access to credit and capital. Difficulty accessing financial services, affordable credit, and investment capital has long been a problem, especially in lowincome and h istorically disinvested communities. Support efforts to help lowincome indi viduals and communities gain acc ess to lowcost financial products and services, highreturn savings products, and investment capital that meet the specific needs of economically underserved communities. Protect assets and savings. Support policies that preserve as sets and protect individuals a nd families from predatory practices. Specifically , protections for student loan borrowers and policies that promote access to education, lessen student debt burdens, and make loan repayment more manageable. Defaulting on a student PAGE | 104 Alameda County Federal Legislative Priorities 2018 loan can ruin a borrower's credit and impact future opportuniti es. Additionally, s upport protecting the continuation of Pell Grant and Cal Grant loans that provide fin ancial aid in meeting the increasing cost of a college education. Promote retirement savings. L e s s t h a n h a l f o f C a l if o r n i a ' s p r iv a t e s e c t o r w o rk e r s h a v e a cc e ss to an employersponsored retirement plan. Support State and federal p olicies that promote retirement savings that make it easier to save. Preserve, expand, and increase fe deral tax credits for lowinco me childless individuals and families. Protect eligibility for the Child Tax Credit (CTC) for all taxp aying families, including undocumented immigrants who have tax filing responsibilities. Support policies that protect child tax credit eligibility for immigrants who use an Individual Tax Identification Number (ITIN) to file taxes. Limiting the child tax credit to only those with Social Security Numbers not only impa cts the families with mixed immigration statuses but impacts the economy as a whole. Expand and increase the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). Support expanding this vital credit and ensuring lowincome working fami lies are able to keep more of t heir hardearned money. Expand refundable tax credits. More federal tax credits (includi ng the Child Tax Credit) shoul d be fully refundable so that all lowincome families, even those wi thout a tax liability, can benefit from the credits. Implement a refundable tax c redit for foster parents. This credit could help increase foster homes for children and youth. Reauthorize the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) program and ensure adequate funding. The VITA program is a safe, effective, and free tax preparation ser vice for lowand moderateincome individuals and families that helps them to keep more of their hard earned money and file accurate tax returns. Invest in PlaceBased Initiatives Too many children in our communities are growing up in neighbor hoods with no grocery stores, closed parks, and struggling schools. Recognizi ng that people and place are i nextricably linked, placebased initiatives take a comprehensive approach to community development and aim to revi talize multiple aspects of neighborhood to create lasting change for its residents. Promote and expand placebased strategies that concentrate reso urces and investment in communities with the highest levels of need. A placebased approach should include strategies to bring public benefits and services out into the community and to prov ide wealth building, wage subsidies, and job supports to residents. Support placebased initiatives. S pecifically, support the Partnership for Sustainable Communitie s' Integrated Planning and Investment Grants Initiative, Promise N eighborhoods, Choice Neighborhoods, the Community Economic Developmen t Program, the Healthy Food Fi nancing Initiative, the Byrne Criminal Justice Innovation Gra nts, and the broader P romise Zones Initia tive. Support neighborhood revitalization through the Promise Zone In itiative. This initiative aims to revitalize highpoverty communities by creating local jobs, spu rring economic activity, improving educational opportunities, leveraging private investment, and reducing viol ent crime. Support measures that create coordinated efforts to benefit d esignated Promise Zones, includ ing: Priority for relevant federal funding opportunities from the De partments of Housing and Urban Development, Health and Human Services, Justice, Education, Agr iculture, Labor, Commerce, and Transportation, Treasury, and others. Tax deductions for business property located within a community designated as a Promise Zone and employment tax credits for businesses that locate within Promis e Zones and/or hire residents living in Promise Zones. PAGE | 105 Alameda County Federal Legislative Priorities 2018 PRESERVE, RESTORE AND ENHANCE SAFETY NET PROGRAMS Reauthorize TANF with a focus on alleviating poverty and preven ting material hardship among children and families. TANF reauthorization should also focus on rebuilding partnershi p between the federal government, states, and counties to move forward with c ommon goals. Specifically: Maintain and expand subsidized employment. Permanently authorize and appropriate funding for subsidized employment as enacted originally in the American Rec overy and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Enhance employment and training services. Create effective pathways to economic opportunity including access to mainstream e ducation, training, internships and individualized services for those with barriers to employment. Employment programs should be focused o n improving family economic well being, and not be designed to di scourage participation in TANF programs for families in need. Restore and enhance flexibility. State and county flexibility is vital to tailor work, training and family stabilization activities to families' individual needs. TANF re authorization should measure states' performance in a fair and comprehensive manner that recognizes multiple potential positive outcomes for families. Eliminate asset limits for TANF. The current asset limits create a disincentive for families to save and are contrary to the goals of TANF. Eliminating asset limits red uces administrative costs and promotes savings and selfsufficiency. Remove the lifetime ban for anyone convicted of a drugrelated felony. Restoring access to these benefits will not only improve outcomes for very vulnerable fam ilies, but also improve public safety by increasing the opportunity for e mployment and financial stabili ty and reducing the risks of reoffending. Restore and protect benefits to immigrants. 1996 TANF legislation impo sed a fiveyear ban on federal meanstested benefits for legal immigrants. Support res toring and protectin g those benefits and ensuring immigrants, including undocumented immigrants, have ac cess to basic assistance, including health care, nutrition supports, housing, access to early care and education, and culturally competent legal services. Preserve and increase funding for TANF. The TANF block grant has been set at $16.5 billion each year since 1996; as a result, its real value has fallen by onethird due to inflation. Eliminate the \"marriage penalty.\" Currently, twoparent households have a higher hourly participation requirement and states are required to achieve a 90 percent work participation rate for these families. Support eliminating these additional requirements to allow for more flexibility in serving twoparent families. Preserve and maintain contingency funding for TANF. In times of economic downturn, contingency funds are essential for states to serve all families in need. Expand the time limit for TANF. The 60month lifetime limit restricts the ability of those in t he highest need to receive services and suppo rts necessary to gain financi al stability. Vulnerable families may need to return to aid due to economic dow nturns or new family hardships . Increase income disregards. A TANF family's grant decreases as the family earns more income . However, a p o r t i o n o f e a r n e d i n c o m e , k n o w n a s t h e \" e a r n e d i n c o m e d i s r e g a rd,\" is excluded from the grant calculation. Support policies that increase or modify the incom e disregard to encourage work and allow families to keep more of their e arnings, and grant levels to be higher. Support funding and services for noncustodial parents of TANF eligible children. Noncustodial parents of children in poverty often fall behind in their child support payments because they, too, are struggling to get by. Support policies, funding and services for noncustodial pa rents to receive employment services that promote selfsufficiency and ability to care for their child(re n). Support Adults without Dependents L o w i n c o m e c h i l d l e s s a d u l t s a r e n o t e l i g i b l e f o r m o s t s t a t e o r f e d e r a l c a s h a i d p r o g r a m s . A c o m p r e h e n s i v e approach is needed to strengthen the social safety net for all individuals, including those who are not caring for children. PAGE | 106 Alameda County Federal Legislative Priorities 2018 Increase federal supports for lowincome adults without depende nts. Support policies that provide increased cash aid, employment assistance, and other supportive services for lowincome adults without dependents. Programs should recognize and address barriers to e mployment while also encouraging participation in the labor market to improve economic wellbein g not be designed to dis courage participation in supportive programs for people in need. Protect and Enhance Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program ( SNAP) The SNAP/CalFresh program provides monthly benefits to eligible lowincome individuals and families to purchase food. Alameda County supports strengthening SNAP and ensuring t his vital program reaches individuals and families struggling with food insecurity. Specifically: Protect and increase SNAP benefi ts and ensure access to critica l nutrition support. Alameda County opposes block granting the program, which would limit funding o ver time, as well as the ability of localities to respond to increased need during an economic downturn, opposes a n y c u t s t o S N A P o r r e s t r i c t i o n s o n eligibility, and support s benefit level increases for individua ls and families experien cing food insecurity. Ensure food access for adults without dependents. Under current federal law, certain unemployed individuals without dependents can face time limits of three mo nths of SNAP benefits in any 36month period. Alameda County opposes this rule. Until the rule is repealed, s upport continued State and local waivers to ensure individuals are able to access critical food benefits. Identify opportunities to streamline and simplify. Support efforts to streamline, and simplify federal SNAP requirements to enhance enrollment and retention. Support programs and policies that improve access to healthy an d nutritious food. S upport programs and policies that improve access to healthy and nutritious food for physically or medically homebound individuals, including individuals and families in remote areas. Increase the minimum allotment . This is especially important for elderly and/or disabled hous eholds and should be increased. Maintain and provide additional flexibility. Allow states to align SNAP eligibility and processes with state TANF programs (and Medicaid) and allow state flexibility and st reamlining, such as the expanded categorical eligibility and \"reverse express lane\" enrollment to automatica lly provide SNAP to Medicaideligible individuals. Remove existing bans for certain individuals. Support restoring eligibility to all documented immigrants, policies that entitle Supplemental Security Income (SSI) recipi ents to SNAP benefits, drop the lifetime ban on benefits for individuals with drug or violent crime felonies, a nd remove the time limits on receipt of SNAP for jobless adults. Increase outreach and nutrition education funding. Provide adequate resources to states and community partners for administration of SNAP outreach and nutrition educ ation and the SNAPEducation program. Restore free Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) Point of Sale (P OS) equipment for all retailers. As a result of cuts made in the 2014 Farm Bill, retailers are no longer offere d free EBT equipment, supplies, and related services to participate in SNAP/CalFresh. Support restoring acc ess to EBT equipment to ensure SNAP recipients can access their benefits at a variety of retailers. Promote increased access to nutri tious and affordable food in n eighborhoods. Specifically, support the efforts to develop additional supermarkets and outlets in \"food deserts\" and to equip al l farmers' markets with EBT capability. Improve timeliness of data. Specifically, data provided by the USDA Food and Nutrition Serv ice (FNS) to states for use in administering SNAP. PAGE | 107 Alameda County Federal Legislative Priorities 2018 Preserve and support additional funding and flexibility for SNA P Employment and Training (E&T). Support additional appropriations for SNAP E&T and policies and pilots that seek to improve employment outcomes for SNAP recipients. Oppose efforts to deny support through the imposition of overly burdensome work requirements. Overly burdensome work requirements are costly for agencies to impleme nt, and function to deny access to desperately needed nutritional, health, and income support prog rams to individuals who may be experiencing discrimination in labor practices outside of their control such as hiring, consistency of scheduling, or pay. Support program rules that allow State flexibility in defining work and work preparation activities. Child Nutrition Programs Expand access to meals during school breaks. When school is not in session, many lowincome children lose access to free and reducedprice school breakfasts, lunches, an d afterschool snacks they rely on during the regular school year. Support policies to coordinate and expand access to free meals when school is not in session, including the summer mo nths, and connect kids and thei r families to healthy nutrition assistance. Reauthorize and improve the Child Nutrition Act. This legislation oversees critical child nutrition programs, including school meals, summer meals, afterschool meal programs , and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). Support policie s that make it easier for children and families to access nutrition programs and ensure adequate funding. Food Banks Support food banks. The Alameda County Community Food Bank estimates that one in fi ve Alameda County residents turn to the Food Bank for assistance. Support efforts to help local food banks secure nutritious food and assist individuals and families in applying for SNAP. Speci fically, expanding The Eme rgency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP) bonus buys federal program. Better Assist Immigrants, Refugees, and Asylees Currently a third of Alameda County residents are foreignborn. The existing system of services and providers who work with immigrants, including undocumented immigrants, refuge es, and asylees is complicated and can be difficult to navigate and access . As one of eight RefugeeImpac ted counties in California, Alameda County recognizes the unique needs of immigrant popul ations to access services, g ain employment, and integrate into their new communities. Protect and increase access to services for immigrants, includi ng undocumented immigrants, refugees, and asylees. In particular, immigrants, incl uding undocumented immigrants, n eed access to basic assistance, including health care, nutrition supports, housing, early care and educat ion, and culturally competent and quality legal services to keep families together and secure; and, communities whole. Alameda County opposes policies and initiatives that place restrictions of services and benefits to immigrants, including undocumented immigrants. Additional supports and services for refugees and asylees. Support additional State and federal funding to expand services available to refugees and asylees. Specifically , we support increasing Refugee Cash Assistance payment levels, providing homelessness and housing supports, ex panding employment and vocational training programs, and increasing other supportive services.

PAGE | 108 Alameda County Federal Legislative Priorities 2018 ADVANCE FOSTER YOUTH WELLBEING AND STRENGTHEN CHILD WELFARE SE RVICES The Alameda County Social Services Agency's Department of Child ren and Family Services serves children and youth who have experienced, or a re atrisk of experiencing, abu se, or neglect. Preserve and Enhance Services and Programs Alameda County supports a range of increases in child welfare f unding and supportive services to improve the wellbeing of children, inclu ding undocumented children. Reform child welfare financing to focus on prevention activitie s. Support changes to federal funding to provide states with the flexibility to make frontend investmen ts in family services in order to reduce stays in foster care, rather than only funding services for children aft er they are placed in outofhome care. Update Title IVE eligibility requirements. Specifically, update the eligibi lity requirements associated wi th the socalled 1996 \"lookback\" pro vision of Title IVE of the S ocial Security Act, so that more children are eligible for federal foster care assistance. Currently, childre n are only eligible for federal assistance if the family from which they are being removed would have been eligible for AFDC (Aid to Families with Dependent Children) under the program rules in 1996. Support policy chang es that update the requirements (perhaps through using an income limit that is based on the federal pove rty level). Funding for services and income supports needed by parents seek ing to reunify with their children who are in foster care. This could include: Funding for childcare, housing, immigration legal services, and other necessary supportive services. Additional funding and policies to support the availability and quality of substance abuse programs for parents. Specifically, support of substance abuse family reside ntial programs that allow for 1) an entire family, including both parents, to reside together, and 2) single fathe rs to reside in the program with their child(ren). Typically, residential programs do not allow the family to rema in together, which causes additional trauma to children who must separate from one or both parents. Additional resources that promote better outcomes for children. Examples include culturally relevant mental health services, educatio nal supports, employment/linked learning opportunities, matchedsavings accounts, developmental child care (including postpermanency), r e s p i t e s e r v i c e s f o r r e l a t i v e a n d f o s t e r caregivers, services and resources promoting father engagement, housing subsidies, onestop community centers serving families (e.g. wi th employment, housing, and he althcare), and improved mental health service delivery to foster youth through the increased availability of licensed clinicians trained in empiricallybased treatments for youth who h ave experienced trauma. Elimination of resource limits on income supports and benefits g i v e n d i r e c t l y t o t h e y o u t h s u c h a s matched savings accounts, Social Security Income (SSI), and SNA P. Providing additional resources to foster youth will increase the chances of their success ful transition to adulthood. The continued provision of flexible funding through the Title I VE Waiver. The waivers have enabled counties to increase the use of c ommunity services to prevent c hild abuse and neglect and divert families away from formal child welfare services. This has increased permanen ce for children through strategies like family finding and engagement. Strengthen policies, services, and other resources to address t he disproportionate presence of African American, Latino, and Native American children in foster care. Support leadership and funding to improve conditions in lowincome communities of color that contain high levels of unemployment, crime, homelessness, substance abuse, and disproportionate experiences with the child welfare system. Services and resources are needed to assist children and families early on t o prevent any need for child welfare services in the future. Increase funding to support counties in monitoring and providin g services to foster youth who are authorized by the court to recei ve psychotropic medications. The children served by the foster care system have experienced severe trauma; for some, medication is appropr iate when thoughtfully prescribed as part of an overall treatment plan that includes nonpharmacological int erventions as well. S upport additional funding for behavioral health services for youth and to support countie s in providing oversight and monitoring of psychotropic medications prescribed to foster youth. PAGE | 109 Alameda County Federal Legislative Priorities 2018 Expand child welfare funding and resources to populations with unique needs: Youth in foster care who are also parents. Parenting foster youth are in particular need of services that promote their educational attainment, parenting skills, and res ources that support their transition to independence. Children of foster youth. Provide resources and supports f or children of foster youth. In particular, support continuing to provide resources, including but not limited to a n Infant Supplement, while the parent is temporarily away from placement but still caring for their chil d (for instance when they are living in a shelter). This change will help ensure food and other basic necessities t o the infant until they both return to an eligible foster setting. Undocumented children of undocumented parents who are under chi ld welfare supervision. Additional resources are needed to ensure that these families receive the necessary services to prevent the child from entering into or remaining in fo ster care. Support increased fu nding to address reunification barriers faced by many immigrant families in the child welfare system. Families who speak a language other than English. Resources are needed to support counties in hiring additional bilingual staff to pr ovide assistance to children an d families in their preferred language. Support for children of incarcerated parents. Additional funding and programs that promote the health, safety, and wellbeing of the children of incarcerated parents and the efforts of parents to reunify with their children are needed. Parents and children with disabilities. Foster children with disabilities, their parents, and their car egivers need additional support to navigat e systems and services that m ay meet their developmental, educational, and medical needs. Disabled parents also may need addi tional resour ces and support to access needed services. Commercially Sexually Exploited Children (see section below). Establish Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits for all e ligible foster youth and allow those benefits to remain in suspense for the duration of their stay in foster care. Current law leads to situations where foster youth who are both disabl ed and from impoverished backgr ounds, risk being dropped from, or not able to access, SSI even though they meet other eligibility criteria . Support policy changes that ensure all foster youth who are eligible can apply for SSI benefits and maintain their SSI eligibility throughout their involvement in foster care, without the need for an annual temporary suspen sion of the Title IVE or federal payment. Support agreements with consulates and foreign governments for the protection of foster youth. Statewide agreements with foreign consulates and governments ar e needed to enhance the services provided to minors and their parents when the parent or child is a forei gn national. These agreements should clarify the responsibilities between parties to protect the safety of m inors during custody and dependency proceedings involving minors who have experienced abuse or negl ect. Preserve and enhance existing funding sources. Support the enhancement of existing programmatic funding sources that provide either direct or indirect services to children in foster care, or who are at risk of abuse or neglect. Alameda County opposes the proposed eliminati on of flexible funding sources, such as the Social Services Block Grant (SSBG) and Community Services Block Grant (CSBG). Support Caregivers and Provide Permanency for Foster Youth Increase funding for foster and adoptive parent recruitment, tr aining, and retention. Alameda County encourages additional support, f unding, and other resources des igned to increase the number of qualified caregivers available to provide stable and loving foster and ad optive homes. Examples of supports and resources deemed critical by caregivers: Increased funding for and access to subsidized childcare and re spite care. Funding for onetime expenses, such as a bed. Specialized training and targeted support services, including t hose that offer inhome based services, for c a r e g i v e r s o f f o s t e r y o u t h w i t h a c u t e m e n t a l h e a l t h n e e d s , c o m m ercially sexually exploited children, or disabled children. PAGE | 110 Alameda County Federal Legislative Priorities 2018 A statewide public education camp aign to promote interest in fo ster parenting. A refundable tax credit for foster parents. Expand funding and eligibility time for postplacement services to support permanence for children who have left foster care through reunification, adoption, or guard ianship. Policies should help maintain the child in their home and prevent reentry to foster care. For example, housing and child care assistance to help parents provide a safe and stable environment as well as superv ision for their child(ren) while they are at work or school. There are limited housing and child care slots avail able through existing resources, and additional resources should be targeted specifically to these families. Ot her examples include substance abuse treatment and mental health services that are culturally responsive to th e child and the adoptive parent or guardian. Provide KinGAP benefits to child ren whose relative guardianshi p was established in Probate Court. Although Probate Court guardians hips with a nonrelative can be eligible for Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) Foster Care payme nts, relative guardianships es tablished in Probate Court do not qualify for KinGAP, even though many of these children have needs similar to youth who have a guardianship established in Juvenile Court. Providing KinGAP benefits to these probate guardianship youth will improve their transition to adulthood and may reduce their need for social services as a n adult. Remove barriers to legal guardianship for youth. C urrent law does n't allow for g uardians hips by Non Relative Extended Family Members (NREFMs) and nonrelated foste r parents for youth under age six. Alameda County supports providing statutor y authorization for courts to establish guardianships when a NREFM is the caregiver to a child under age six or to a child within a sibli ng group with at least one sibling under age six, whenever the child is unable to return to their parent's or gua rdian's care. The intent of this change is not to divert children away from adoption but instead provide as many options available as possible to provide legal permanence for foster children. Continued support for policies and resources that meet the need s o f L G B T Q ( l e s b i a n , g a y , b i s e x u a l , transgender, and questioning) foster youth and recognize a yout h's gender identity. Alameda County encourages additional laws and policies, such as SB 731 (Statut es of 2015), that promote the protections of rights of foster youth who are LGBTQ and are supportive of a fo ster youth's gender identity. Computer data systems and forms should allow for recognition of gender identi ty in addition to the youth's gender assigned at birth. Additional resources are needed to further the recruitme nt and retention of resource families that will provide effective care for LGBTQ youth. Support the enhancement and strengthening of connections betwee n foster youth and persons in their support network. A dd i t i on al r e s o ur c e s an d i m p r o v e d p o li c i es a r e n e e d e d t h a t h e lp maintain networks of service providers, family, and friends that serve the best inte rests of foster youth, even though they are not the parent or resource parent to the youth. These support networks are vital to the health and wellbeing of foster youth. Allow for continued benefits after age 18 for all former foster youth who exited from foster care to a guardianship prior to their 18th birthday. Current law limits eligibility for these benefits based on the youth's age at the time the guardianship was established. These limits have created a disincentive for permanency for these children. Support policies that extend Federal and State KinGAP (to relative gua rdians) and State AFDC FC (to nonrelated guardians) benefits to age 21 for youth who otherwise meet eligibility criteria except for the age at which the guardianship was established. Improve Assistance and Services for TransitionAge Youth Additional supports and programs for transitionage foster yout h (ages 14 - 21). In October 2010, California passed AB 12, also known as the California Fostering Connections to Success Act, in response to the federal Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptio ns Act (Public Law 110351). AB 12 changed foster care significantly by opt ionally extending foster care u ntil age 21. Although some transitionage foster youth now have the benefit of ex tended foster care, these youth often remain in need of additional funding, policies, and programs that support their transition out of fos ter care and into independent adulthood. Specifically, Alameda County supports: PAGE | 111 Alameda County Federal Legislative Priorities 2018 Increased financial support for programs that assist foster you th in the transition to financial stability. Examples include postemancipati on assistance such as secondary education, job training, housing, access to health care, and tax credits to employers for the employment of a current or former foster youth. Support the intent of both S. 885 and H.R. 2060; bills that would provide f or such a tax credit. Additional funding for safe and stable housing and supportive s ervices such as substance abuse or mental health treatment. There is a specific need for financial support of a continuum o f care of substance abuse programs for minors to ensure th at all youth in need are able t o receive services. Flexibility with placement requirements for nonminor dependent s (NMDs) in Extended Foster Care who are in need of inpatient substance abuse treatment. If a NMD's temporary stay in an inpatient facility could be considered a Supervised Independent Living Placement, for ex ample, this would allow the otherwise eligible youth to remain in Extended Foster Care and receive related ser vices that support their transition to independence, rather than forcing their exit from care. Expand Independent Living Program (ILP) eligibility to include older youth in Family Maintenance. Youth who are nearing adulthood (age 16 - 1 8 ) a n d r e c e i v i n g i n h o m e c h i l d w e l f a r e s e r v i c e s , s u c h a s F a m i l y Maintenance, are in need of services supporting their transitio n to independence as healthy and responsible adults. An expansion of eligibi lity requirements for ILP funds could allow for the provision of services to these youth and better prepare them for adulthood. Allow for after care benefits to continue for youth up until ag e 23. Support the intent of S. 1215 and H.R. 2847, bills that would allow states to serve former foster yout h under the John H. Chafee Foster Care Program for an additional two years. Provide counties funding to fulfill credit report monitoring an d assistance activities to foster youth. Identity theft is a major concern for youth in foster care and can destr oy their credit. For foster children who \"age out\" of the system as young adults , the consequences of identit y theft are particularly devastating and can make it difficult to rent an apartment or obtain educational loans. Support additional funding for counties to assist with monitoring credit reports on behalf of foster youth and en suring that youth receive assistance in interpreting their reports and clearing any inaccuracies, as re quired by State a nd federal law. Ensure the Safety and WellBeing of Commercially Sexually Explo ited Children (CSEC) Additional funding and supports for Commercially Sexually Explo ited Children (CSEC). Responding to CSEC requires a multipronged response t h a t d o e s n o t c r i m i n a l i z e t h e youth for their actions and includes prevention, intervention, and after care. Support additional fu nding and resources, beyond what is currently provided to counties, to expand training, tailor services, and support collaborative work with other systems. More funding is needed to address the immediate needs of victim s, including clothing and safe shelter, and to provide longterm services to assist CSEC victims in achieving positive outcomes of permanency and wellbeing. Protect and enhance funding for homeless youth. The Runaway and Homeless Youth Act (RHYA) authorizes communitybased runaway and homeless youth projects to provide temporary shelter an d care to runaways or otherwise homeless youth who are in need of temporary shelte r , c o u n s e l i n g , a n d a f t e r c a r e s e r v i c e s . Approximately 1 out of every 5 homeless youth are victims of tr afficking, with higher rates of victimization occurring for LGBTQ youth and youth with previous involvement i n the child welfare system. RHYA provides necessary funding to provide for these vulnerable young people. Support enhanced funding for RHYA, or similar introduced legislation for runaway and homeless youth, recogniz ing the increasing need to provide for CSEC and vulnerable youth who experie nce trafficking and exploitatio n. Align Child Welfare Requirements with Local Best Practice Effor ts Flexibility allowing for exempti ons in existing requirements co ncerning social worker contacts with foster youth that unfairly penalize counties. Policy changes are needed to remove penalties when social worke rs are unable to make monthly face to face contact with a foster youth who has run away from placement and his or her current whereabouts are unknown. The existing requirements do not consider and give credit for the social worker's efforts to locate and make contact with the youth. PAGE | 112 Alameda County Federal Legislative Priorities 2018 SUPPORT ADULTS, SENIORS, AN D PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES The growing demographics of aging require a fundamental shift i n how we view and incorporate aging in our system of services and in our communities. It is projected that the Alameda County senior population will increase by over 40 percent in the next ten years and approximately 50 p ercent of all seniors in Alameda County do not have adequate financial resources to address their daily needs. In addition, approximately one in five people with disabilities in Alameda County liv e below the federal poverty l ine. Protect and Enhance Systems and Programs Protect and increase funding available to develop and support a ffordable, accessible, and integrated housing options for seniors and persons with disabilities. Older adults and persons wit h disabilities often live on fixed incomes and appropriate housing options are scarce and incomes are not increasing at the same rate as housing prices. Local affordable housing resources are sever ely limited, which is adversely impacting the health, care, and quality of life of seniors and people with di sabilities. Fiftyfour percent of adults over age 65 live below 200 percent of federal poverty, and people with disa bilities are twice as likely as others to live in poverty. Inability to find or sustain stable housing results in h e a l t h s y s t e m c o s t s w h e n p e o p l e c a n n o t transition from institutional care. Support housing strategies that allow people to modify their home, access assisted living, health and supportive services, leverage Medic aid to access housing dollars and find housing after a health crisis for older adults and people with disabili ties. Specifically, support HUD's Supportive Housing for the Elderly, or the Section 202 program. Preserve, support and expand pro grams for equitable access to a dvance care planning (ACP) and endof life services at any age. Advance care planning gives people a way to think about death a nd dying allowing them to confront dying directly instead of being a \"vague, unma nageable concept\" or leaving the end of life decisions up to others once the patient is unable to meaningful ly participate in the process. Supporting programs that provide culturally relevant outreach and understa nding of palliative care and hospice to our diverse populations will increase equitable access and utilizat ion of endof life services. Fully support the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The ADA prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities in employment, transportation, public accommo dation, communications, and governmental activities. Alameda Co unty opposes all efforts to erode the leg islative mandate of the ADA. Specifically, we oppose ADA notification bills that seek to create barriers to f iling a complaint, resulting in loss of access and civil rights. Increase employment opportunities for older adults and individu als with disabilities. Support policies that help older adults and individuals with disabilities access trai ning and employment opportunities that lead to competitive and integrated employment. Specifically, we support policies such as subsidized employment or tax incentives that encourage employers to hire older adults an d individuals with disabilities. Support Achieving a Better Life Experience (ABLE) Act improveme nts. Created in 2014, ABLE accounts are taxadvantaged savings accounts for individuals with disabiliti es and their families. Savings in ABLE accounts do not affect eligibility for SSI, Medicaid and other public be nefits. Support the ABLE Act and the enactment of policies that enhance and improve the current laws. Support fair access to resources and services. Older adults and people with disabilities have the right to liv e free from abuse, neglect, exploitation, and discriminatory prac tices. Older adults and people with disabilities have the right to services that promote independence and autono my. Support policies that promote parity of resources and services among older adults and people with disab ilities, including those with cognitive impairments, regardless of their social, economic, and immigrat ion status. Support services that are linguistically and culturally accessi ble. Individuals and families who speak a language other than English have the right to receive services in their preferred language. Support funding and resources that allow hiring of additional bilingual staff to pr ovide assistance to older adults and people with disabilities in their preferred language. Reform and improve Supplemental Security Income (SSI). Support restoring the original intent of the SSI PAGE | 113 Alameda County Federal Legislative Priorities 2018 program (protecting seniors and people with disabilities from t he harms of living in poverty) by eliminating the asset limit, updating earned and unearned income disregard rule s, improving the application process, standardizing the time it takes to approve or deny applications , technological advancements that promote access to services and administrative efficiencies , and modernizing financial eligibility rules. Additionally, support policies that allow SSI recipients to access Supplement al Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits. Alameda County opposes any cuts to these benefits. Appropriate planning funds for CareerACCESS pilot projects. CareerACCESS is a communitydriven proposal to reform SSI rules so that young adults with disabili ties can work and achiev e their full potential without risking losing their disability benefits. Under the pil ot, youth would create a career plan supported by coaching, counseling and employment support services. The pilot would allow for increased earnings and remove asset limits. Preserve and expand the Community Choice First Option (CFCO). The CFCO increases federal funding for many home and communitybased services. California receives a s ix percent enhancement in federal funding for InHome Supportive Services (IHSS) for approximately 50 per cent of IHSS recipients, representing nearly 70 percent of total IHSS hours paid, as these are the highest need IHSS clients. Because CFCO is a component of the Affordable Care Act, its funding certainty has been threate ned with proposals for ACA repeal. If CFCO were repealed, states and counties would have a higher cost burden f or providing services to seniors and persons with disabilities with high need. Coordinate the System of Care for Older Adults Systematic inefficiencies are extremely costly while keeping pe ople from getting the essential care and services they need. To accommodate the gro wing numbers of older adults w ho need services and serve them cost effectively, Alameda County supports a coordinated service deli very system that protects, supports, and advocates for an aging population. Specifi cally, we support the integrati on and simplification of the complex system of senior services to ensure policies and programs are consumerfo cused and that residents have access to and receive the services they need. Preserve, support and expand programs and policies that promote Healthy Aging/Aging in Place . Older adults often lack access to infor mation and resour ces about soc ial service and health issues, or are unaware of preventative measures they can t ake to remain he althier for lon ger. Support policies that promote healthy aging, independence, and wellbein g of seniors who wish to age in place, or who wish to remain in their homes as they age. Reduce nutrition insecurity for seniors. According to the Alameda County Community Food Bank, residents over 50 years old now make up more than onethird of their clie nts. This need is only expected to increase as older adults are the fastest gro wing segment of the population in Alameda County; however, State and federal funding for senior nutrition is limited and restrictive. Suppor t protecting and increasing funding and funding flexibility for senior nutrition programs and services. Support and increase funding for Elder Courts. Many seniors find the legal system complicated and difficult to navigate, which creates a barrier to remediation of legal is sues such as elder abuse, housing disputes, and more. Elder Courts facilitate legal issues specifically for sen iors, including coordinating, scheduling, and making referrals to providers. Preserve and expand programs that support caregivers. Families are the major provider of longterm care for older adults, but research has shown that caregiving exacts a heavy emotional and financial toll. Almost half of all caregivers are over age 50, making them more vulner able to a decline in their own health, and one third describe their own health as fair to poor. Support incre ased efforts to support caregivers through creation of a BlueRibbon Caregiver Council and restoration of funding to Caregiver Resource Centers. Support adequate and stable funding for the State LongTerm Car e Ombudsman Program (LTCOP). LTCOP is mandated, through State and f ederal law, to protect resident s' rights and ensure that residents are treated with respect and dignity. Complaints identified and investigate d by Ombudsmen are often the precursors to PAGE | 114 Alameda County Federal Legislative Priorities 2018 more severe cases of abuse and neglect. Increased ongoing fundi ng would enable the program to conduct vital unannounced monitoring visits to all longterm care facilities in Alameda County; recruit, supervise and train volunteer Ombudsmen; investigate more complaints per year; and, advocate for residents rights and safety. Protect and increase funding, capacity, and access to critical senior services and programs. S upport restorations and expansions of p rograms that help older adults age with independence and dignity in their homes and communities. This includes the Adult Day Health Care, Multipurpose Senior Services Program (MSSP), PACE (Program of AllInclude Care for the Elderly), and other Medicaid funded services. Promote retirement savings. L e s s t h a n h a l f o f C a l i f o r n i a ' s p r i v a t e s e c t o r w o r k e r s h a v e a c c e ss to an employersponsored retirement plan. Support State and federal p olicies that promote retirement savings and make it easier to save. Increase funding for programs that support the integration of h ealth care and social services focused on aging and advance care planning . Funding a whole person approach to care and reducing barriers to the integration of health and social service systems will increase the coordination of services and allow sharing of vital health information. The in tegration of advance care plann ing into a health and social services regimen allows time to put social supports in place before selfcare an d mobility are limited by the downward trajectory of a terminal illness. The ability to stay at home with integra ted health care and soci al services may reduce hospital readmissions, futile treatments, and suffering from sy mptom burdens, while also improving the quality of care at the end of life. Preserve, restore, and increase funding for communitybased pro grams for seniors and people with disabilities. Over the past few years, senior safety net funding for multiple programs under the Older C a l i f o r n i a n s A c t a n d O l d e r A m e r i c a n s A c t h a s b e e n e l i m i n a t e d o r severely reduced. Support preserving, reinstating and increasing funding for these and other programs that support seniors and people with disabilities. Increase funding to expand services specifically for older adul ts with mental health and cooccurring substance abuse issues. Behavioral health concerns are not a normal part of the aging p rocess. Mental illness and substance use disorders are major impediments to living wel l in old age; they cause considerable personal suffering and make it difficult for older people to achieve the ir potential. Older adults who become disabled by mental illness deserve the same guarantee of care already exten ded to those who face other kinds of disabilities. For more information on these issues, please see the Behavioral Health section in the Health Chapter. Protect and enhance funding for Older Americans Act (OAA) appro priations. OAA provides the federal mandate to fund Area Agencies on Aging (AAA). The services that the AAA provides to residents age 60 and older are often underfunded or restricted. Support the protecti on and enhancement of appropriation to the OAA Titles and additional local f lexibility in Title III fundin g. Support strengthening th e Aging Network's role and capacity in the coordination and provision of longterm ser vices and supports, expanding local evidence based health promotion and disease prevention activities, impro ving community preparedness for an aging population, and setting adequat e authorized funding levels. Sup port increased federal funding and flexibility. Increase funding and support for Aging & Disability Resource Ce nters (ADRCs). ADRCs serve as single points of access into the longterm supports and services system for o lder adults and people with disabilities. Support increased appropriations to the ADRCs as well as any measures t hat can strengthen the structure and resources available to ADRCs. Support expansion of the Senior Community Service Employment Pr ogram (SCSEP). SCSEP is the largest federallyfunded program specifically targeting older adults se eking employment and training assistance. In 2016 under SCSEP, 70,000 older adults received onthejob train ing while providing nearly 36 million hours of staff support to 30, 0000 organizations. Protect the Prevention and Public Health Fund (PPHF) in the Aff ordable Care Act (ACA). Every 11 seconds an older adult is treated in an emergency room for a fallrelat ed injury. Support protecting funding for PPHF, specifically preserving the Cent er for Disease Control's Fall P revention program. PAGE | 115 Alameda County Federal Legislative Priorities 2018 Protect Vulnerable Adults Alameda County Division of Adult Protection consists of Adult P rotective Services (APS), Office of the Public GuardianConservator (PG/PC), an d the Public Administrator's Of fice (PA). Together these programs provide a continuum of services that form a safety net for vulnerable adu lts. Institute a federal mandate for Adult Protective Services (APS) that includes adequate and stable funding. Training for APS workers and their partner agencies is severely underfunded (a fraction of funding is received compared to child welfare workers who deal with similar situati ons) and has not kept pace with rising cases. It is imperative that APS workers receive comprehensive training s o that they may provide elder and dependent adult victims of abuse, neglect, and exploitation with the same types of essential services that child abuse victims receive. APS programs re quire ongoing State and federal funding and support to be able to maintain and expand a highlytrained work f o r c e t o s u c c e s s f u l l y s e r v e v u l nerable elders and dependent adults. Additionally, federal funding is necessary to address the needs of underserved groups, including rural older adults, elders of color, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgende r, and queer (LGBTQ) elders. Support increased federal and State funding for APS programs and training. Protect and enhance funding and supports to preserve housing an d prevent eviction for seniors and dependents adults who are victims of abuse or neglect. Senior and dependent adults who are the victims of abuse or neglect are among the most vulnerable to becoming home less. Support State and federal funding for services, casemanagement, and resources to help preserve stabl e housing for vulnerable elders and dependent adults. Protect and increase services and supports for elderly or depen dent adults who are victims of financial abuse. Financial abuse is estimated to account for 40 percent of all f orms of reported abuse against seniors. Dependent adults also face similar challenges. Additional servi ces and supports are needed for education, prevention, and investigation of financial abuse and exploitati on of these populations. Raise awareness of elder and dependent adult abuse. Specifically, support State and federal efforts to better define elder and dependent abuse and ensure consistency in data tracking and reporting. Efforts should be made to lift up the issue an d raise public awareness of this silent epidemic. Enhance coordination to respond to crimes against elders and de pendent adults. Support State and federal e f f o r t s t o m a k e i t e a s i e r f o r a g e n c i e s ( i n c l u d i n g l a w e n f o r c e m e nt, District Attorneys, Public Guardians, Victim/Witness Programs, and the Victims Compensation Board, et c.) that respond to crimes against elder and dependent adults to coordinate se rvices. This should include su pport to identify, prevent, and remedy elder and dependent adult abuse. Improve data collection on elder and dependent adult abuse. There is a lack of good data on elder and dependent abuse. The most recen t national numbers (from 2009) e stimate that 11 percent of older Americans experience abuse, neglect, or ex ploitation in the community (th is survey excluded individuals in nursing homes and other longterm care facilities). The actual prevalence is likely even higher. The National Council on Aging also estimates that only one in 14 cases of abuse come to the a ttention of officials. Addi tional State and federal support is needed to improve loca l data collection on the incid ence of elder and dependent adult abuse. Protect and increase services and supports for elderly or depen dent adults who are victims of crimes. Individuals with disabilities and seniors have a disproportiona tely high victimization rate. According to the most recent Bureau of Justice Statistics report, the rate of se rious violent crimes is three times higher for those with disabilities than those without. Additional services and s upports are needed for education, prevention, and investigation of abuse and exploitation of seniors and indi viduals with disabilities. Protect funding the State Health Insurance Assistance Program ( SHIP, known as HICAP in California). Each year SHIPs support over 15,000 c ounselors who provide free, sta tespecific assistance to over six million people. In Alameda County, HICAP is provided by Legal Assistance for Se niors, and helps thousands of people navigate the complexities of Medicare, ma ny of them referred to HICAP by the Medicare help line. Alameda County supports policies that protect State and federal funding for SH IP/HICAP. Provide and enhance appropriatio ns authorized under the Elder J ustice Act. This funding would help PAGE | 116 Alameda County Federal Legislative Priorities 2018 provide vital adult protective s ervices in states and counties and allow for continued research on elder abuse. Preserve and enhance existing funding sources. Alameda County supports the enhancement of existing programmatic funding sources that provide either direct or indi r e c t s e r v i c e s t o s e n i o r s a n d p e o p l e w i t h disabilities. Alameda County oppo ses the proposed elimination o f flexible funding sources, such as the Social Services Block Grant (SSBG) and Community Services Block Grant (CSBG). Better Serve Veterans Alameda County supports policies that assist veterans with acce ssing benefits, housing, and stable employment. Increase employment opportunities for veterans. S upport policies that help veterans access employment in the public and private sectors. Specifically, support funding f or priorlearning assessments that allow veterans to earn college credit for their military training and skills l earned in service. Reduce veteran homelessness and provide supportive treatment an d services. Support a range of policies t h a t a d d r e s s t h e r o o t c a u s e s o f v e t e r a n h o m e l e s s n e s s . S p e c i f i c a lly, policies that improve employment opportunities, increase substance abuse prevention and treatmen t programs, establish affordable housing, and improve rehabilitation efforts for homeless veterans. Protect veterans funding. Support efforts to ensure that Veterans Affairs services have t imely, predictable funding in an era where continuing resolutions and threats of g overnment shutdowns are all too frequent. Ensure veterans access the benefits for which they are eligible . Support the Department of Veterans Affairs in providing outreach services that educate veterans on the ben efits for which they are eligible. Specifically, increased funding and support to assist veterans in need of com pensation, medical, rehabilitative, educational, and employment services. EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION PLANNING COUNCIL The child care system is meant to fulfill the dual economic goa ls of supporting parental e mployment and laying the groundwork for children's lifelong success. The child care fiel d has struggled to maintain capacity given multiple years of funding cuts at the State and federal levels. The Coun cil strongly supports efforts to protect and improve early care and education funding, ensuring the availability of quality child care, increasing subsidies and expanding home visiting. Stabilize and increase federal funding, and attain new resource s for Early Care and Education (ECE): The ECE Planning Council supports an array of federal funding strea ms that augment Alameda County ECE programs including Child and Adult Care Food Program, Early Head Start a nd Head Start, the Child Care and Development Block Grant, and Temporary A ssistance to Needy Families. Take positions on federal initiatives and budget appropriations that positively impact ECE quality, access and affordability. Advocate for family centered, inclusive, developmentally and cu lturally appropriate practices for all children in care as well as those in transitional kindergarten. Support streamlining and efficiencies such as coordinated regul atory, contracting and reimbursement processes within the current federal and State programs: The Administration for Children and Families has recently issued Child Care and Development Block Grant regulati ons that are laudable and create significant resource needs. Increase ECE reinvestment: Adjusted for inflation federal ECE expenditures are much lower than the preceding decade. Increase ECE professional development and wage supports. PAGE | 117 Alameda County Federal Legislative Priorities 2018 ALAMEDA COUNTY INTERAGENCY CHILD REN'S POLICY COUNCIL (ICPC) FED ERAL HUMAN SERVICES The Alameda County Interagency Children's Policy Council (ICPC) engages in crosssystem collaboration by improving interagency communication, developing childfriendly policies and practices, and initiating systems changes that result in healthy, safe, and thriving children and youth throughout Alameda County. Comprised of County department directors and leaders, ICPC provides advocacy and leadership to improve and enhance service delivery and outcomes for children and youth. Our priorities fo r legislative advocacy are guided by a set of overarching principles that emphasize equity, upstream investme nt, and interagency collaboration. ICPC supports legislative actions that: Prioritize the health and wellbeing of children, youth, and fam ilies, regardless of immigration or housing status Recognize and mitigate systemi c inequities in public systems; Support evidencebased policies a nd programs to ensure healthy, educated children, stable families, and safe and supportive communities.

PAGE | 118 Alameda County Federal Legislative Priorities 2018 HEALTH HEALTH CARE ACCESS, QUA LITY, AND AFFORDABILITY All key provisions of the 2010 Pat ient Protection and Affordabl e Care Act (ACA) are in place as of January 2014, and the legislation has been su ccessful in reducing the rates o f uninsured and in the nation. According to the US Census Bureau, the rate of U.S. residents who were uninsured fe ll from 13.3 percent in 2013 to 10.4 percent in 2014; in California, the rate of uninsured fell from 17.2 pe rcent in 2013 to 12.4 percent in 2014, a decline of almost 5 percentage points. In the County, the rate of uninsure d fell from 12.6 percent in 2013 to 8.2 percent in 2014. However, there were still approximately 65,000 people wit h incomes <200 percent FPL who were uninsured in the County. The County embraces the \"Triple Aim:\" improving patient experie nce, satisfaction and quality, the health of populations, and costeffectivene s s . F o r h e a l t h c a r e r e f o r m t o further succeed, we must maximize health insurance affordability, eligibility, enrollment, and retention , as well as ensuring broad access to appropriate and high quality health care. Special attention should be paid to p olicies that: Simplify the health insurance application process for all, especially hardtoreach and underserved populations. Increase access to care. P r o v i d e l o w e r c o s t a n d m o r e a c c e s s i b l e t r e a t m e n t a l t e r n a t i v e s i n community settings; promote effi ciency; incentivize physicians to go into primary care; incentivize expanded medical staffing, including use of advancedpractice nurses where there are physician shortages and use of a wider range of healthcare team members, such as community health work ers. E x p a n d d e n t a l c a r e a c c e s s a n d p r e v e n t i v e s e r v i c e s f o r l o w i n c o m e Californians. Dental health is a preventive disease, an integral part of overall health and can have impacts on children's growth, development, selfesteem, and learning. The County supports policies that wo uld increase prevention services and new more efficient models of care, such a s the virtual dental home and e xpanded dental teams. Promote federal payment reform that increases the ability to provide preventive services and e stablishes risksharing between hospitals a nd primary care. Support paymen t reform that incentivizes positive health outcomes, not just the ability to bill for more tests or visits . It should promote health education and allow sameday visits for better integrated care, and enable doctors to spend more time with patients at the initial visit to improve the quality of overall care. Ensure maintenance and enhancem ent of the safety net system. Increase provider rates; improve transitions of care (e.g. from ac ute or specialty care to prima ry care medical homes); an d support policies that provide coverage to those with p arttime or temporary employmen t. Use the opportunities provided by the 1115 MediCal 2020 Waiver to enhanc e integration and effectiven ess of the safety net healthcare system. Support adequate Per Member Per Month (PMPM) payments for healt h home services and the new Health Home Program under Afford able Care Act Section 2703. Support improved treatment of chr onic pain while reducing inapp ropriate prescription of opioids and their unsafe storage and disposal. For example, support coverage for and access to acupuncture, ph ysical therapy, and other nonpharmaceutical interventions to treat chronic pai n and opioid addiction, and reduce barriers to opioid and other medication collection sites. Preserve and increase funding for community health centers in order to meet the increased demand for health center services among the ACA's Medicaid Coverage Expans ion population. Protect the confidentiality and privacy of individuals by not disclosing personal information to the US Immigration Customs Enforcement (ICE) and other entities for pu rposes not directly related to administering the program or protecting the individual or public health. PAGE | 119 Alameda County Federal Legislative Priorities 2018 MEDICAID AND HEALTH CARE REFORM The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA) al lowed states to expand Medicaid (MediCal in California). MediCal is California's health insurance program for eligible lowincome individuals and families. Beginning in January 2014, MediCal was expanded to include inc omeeligible childless, nondisabled, adults. Enrollment locally and across the State exceeded all prediction s and onethird of California residents are currently receiving MediCal. Alameda County supports efforts to leverage health care reform to enroll children, individuals and families in the full range of benefits for which they are e ligible. For more information on public benefits (SNAP and TANF), please see the Human Services Chapter. Medicaid Medicaid provides free or lowcost health insurance for eligibl e lowincome individuals and families. Alameda County supports the followin g policy recommendations: Protect and support the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Support protecting rules and requirements for Medicaid and Exchange enrollment under the ACA that reduce program compl e x i t y , r e c o g n i z e t h e c o u n t y r o l e i n eligibility and enrollment, and support Statewide Automated Wel fare System (SAWS) consortia information technology modernization efforts . Alameda County opposes any po licies and efforts to cut funding, reduce current program benefits, or restrict eligibility to the Medica id program. Without necessary funding many families and individuals could lose access to health care, jeop ardizing their wellbeing, and the health of their communities. Protect Medicaid funding. Alameda County opposes efforts to reduce federal funding for Me dicaid administration or benefits, incl uding efforts to place a perca pita cap on funding, create Medicaid block grants for states, or limit the ability of states to leverage funds th rough assessments on providers. Support the protection of and expansion of Medicaid. Support the protection of and expansion of Medicaid for individuals who do not have access to insurance, e specially families, children, and individuals with preexisting health conditions. Oppose the imposition of work requirements for Medicaid. Alameda County opposes placing burdensome work requirements as a condition for the receipt of Medicaid. M edicaid recipients are primarily children, families, people with disabilitie s, and vulnerable adults worki ng lowpaying jobs that do not provide health insurance. Most adults on Medicaid who can work do. Work requir ements would serve to potentially deny life saving services that promote community health and well being, when noncompliance with overly burdensome requirements may be due to discrimination in labor practices ou tside of their control such as hiring, consistency of scheduling, or pay. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES Behavioral health problems (mental health and/or substance use disorders) are significant public health problems impacting millions, and are associated with other chronic disea ses that often result in morbidity and mortality. The effects of mental illness can range from minor disruptions in daily functioning to incapacitating personal, social, and occupational impai rments and premature death. Support for the followi ng items will support the County in prov iding a fiscally sound, comprehensive continuum ng from prevention/early interv ention, treatment and recovery/support that will foster increased access to services, a reduction in mental heal th stigma and discrimination and improved health outcomes for Alameda County resi dents with behavioral health co nditions: Develop a consolidated billing structure for Medicaid and Medic are: Medicaid and Medicare have separate reimbursement criteria and methodologies that have become incre asingly problematic and costly as the number of individuals covered under both Medicaid and Medicare (dual eligible) has risen. Having two separate, distinct systems, with different reimbursement criter ia, contributes to timeintensive billing processes that are cumbersome, confusing and increase the cost of care. Having one consolidated billing system would decrease costs as well as increase billing ease an d efficiency. PAGE | 120 Alameda County Federal Legislative Priorities 2018 End the Medicaid lock out of reimbursable mental health and sub stance use disorder treatment services for youth and adults who are incarcerated. Research shows that 50 percent or more of state pris oners meet the criteria for a diagnosis of drug abuse or dependence, but only 10 percent receive medicallybased drug treatment. Similarly for youth, as many as four out of fiv e teens in the juvenile justice system have drug or alcohol problems, yet fewer than 20 percent have access to substance abuse treatment programs. Additionally, more than 8 in 10 formally incarcerated individua ls have chronic physical, mental, or substance abuse disorders that create significant and distinct reentry ch allenges and service needs; because of the link between substance abuse and crime, allowing for Medicaid reimbu rsable treatment services to incarcerated individuals in both the juvenile and adult prison systems have the potential to yield substantial health and economic benefits. REDUCING INEQUITIES IN HIV In 1998, Alameda County institut ed a State of Emergency due to the disproportionate impact of HIV among African Americans. Approximately 40 percent of all HIV infections in th e County occur in this group, yet African Americans comprise only 11.6 percent of the population. HIV als o disproportionately impacts Latinos and men who have sex with men in the County. Although overall rates of HIV in women are lower, they are even more concentrated in African American women than in other women. It i s t h e g o a l o f t h e C o u n t y t o s t o p t h e transmission of HIV, improve HIV treatment outcomes and combat HIVrelated health dis parities. Biomedical interventions to prevent and treat HIV are now wellestablished and should be implemented in coordination with harm reduction efforts, wraparound services, and traditional p revention (especially education and condom distribution) in order to meet the County goal. This can best b e accomplished by supporting legislation and policy that facilitates access to testing, treatment, PreExposure Pro phylaxis/PostExposure Prophylaxis (PrEP/PEP), and related services for all impacte d populations while at the same time reducing stigma. Support Funding for HIV Prevention and Care: Increase funding for HIV prevention and care. Powerful tools exist for preventing, diagnosing and treating HIV. Increased fu nding will lead to increased access to and more effective use of these tools in impacted communities. Support funding for housing and other supportive services: Alameda County residents infected with or at risk of contracting HIV cannot consistently access HIVrelated services without also addressing basic needs such as food and shelter. Supporting funding to meet these needs for populations affected by HIV is essential to reduce the impact of HIV in the County. SYSTEMS OF CARE FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES Children and adults with disabilities in California rely on sys tems of care that have been chronically underfunded. The US economy is in its seventh year of recovery from the Grea t Recession, but the disability community has not shared in these economic gains. The need for full restoration o f essential safety net services should remain a priority. Disability status is almost a guarantee of significan t disparity in Alameda County: one in five people with a disability live in poverty compared to one in ten people withou t a disability; the percentage of adults with less than a high school education is over twice as high among people with disabilities than those without disabilities; only 22 percent of people with disabilities are employed compared to 67 percent of those without disabilities, and people with disabilities are more likely to experience a high h ousing cost burden comp ared to those without disabilities based on low and ext remely low income status. Alam eda County supports policies that result in better outcomes for children and adults with disabilities, and the development of services designed for all our residents. Restoration of funding, reinvestment in new services , and reform strategies are necessary for the stabilization of our compromised systems of care in order to pr ovide a quality of life beyond institutionalized poverty for children and adults with disabilities. Reform Supplemental Security In come/State Supplemental Payment (SSI/SSP) Payment Structure. SSI/SSP payments are a critical source of income for people with disabilities, but current rates are tied to 1972 legislation and provide income below the poverty line. The SSI payment is below $900 a month. Support legislation that increases Supplemental Security Income payment s , a l l o w s S S I r e c i p i e n t s t o r e c e i v e Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, rais es asset limits and updates the earned and PAGE | 121 Alameda County Federal Legislative Priorities 2018 general income disregard for individuals with disabilities. Fin ancial constraints inherent in the program discourage savings, work, and financial security through restri ctions on income and asset limits. Create policies that encourage asset building and lead to financial security, a nd include cost of living increases. Support the development of national, state and local policies t hat create an infrastructure of programs and services that assist individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and their families. Increase funding to local governments and school districts to meet the fiscal chall enges of providing for a large population of individuals with ASD. ASD is the fastest growing serious develo pmental disability and has a national annual economic impact of $137 billion. In the County, the Department of Developmental Services (DDS) Autism cases have increased 1,573 percent sinc e 1990 (representing just a po rtion of the overall clinicallydefined population). The report, \"Autism Rising\", notes that based on c urrent averages for cost of services for adults with autism, Regional Cen ter annual costs will nearly tr iple over the next ten years, and do not include nonregional center costs such a s parental expenses, InHome Su pport Services, SSI or housing assistance, and do not address significant future factors such as aging par ents, costofliving increases or the need for higher levels of support as the ASD population ages. Oppose the elimination of federal programs proposed under the g uise of \"budget restructuring\" such as ACL's Partnerships for Innovation , Inclusion and Independence ( P3I) proposal. The P3I proposed by the President's budget seeks to consolidate the advocacy and support activities of the State Council on Developmental Disabilities (SCDD), State Independent Livin g Council (SILC) and State Advisory Council on Traumatic Brain Injury for an achieved savings of $57 million. These three agencies serve three distinctly different populations which require an expertise in each of the ir respective disability subgroups; consolidation would be both devastating and illogical, and be disruptive to t heir respective goals. Budget cuts to these successful although underfunded programs would have a detriment al effect on the individuals with disabilities that they are tasked to serve. HEALTH AND WELLBEING OF WOMEN , CHILDREN, YOUTH AND FAMILIES Many more women, children, youth and families now have access t o quality medical care, thanks to years of e d u c a t i o n e f f o r t s , p r o v i d e r o u t r e a c h a n d a d v a n c e s i n m e d i c a l t e chnology. The Affordab le Care Act has also expanded access to care and preventive services for many Alamed a County residents. It is critical that these gains not be reversed. Access to medical care is important and has li kely contributed to improvement in some maternal and child health outcomes - infant mortality, for example, has been declining steadily over the last two decades - and yet women, children, youth and families in many of our comm unities still experience less than optimal health. The low birth weight rate for example, a key maternal and child health indicator, has remained constant over the last ten years. Being born at low birth weight not only contrib utes to significant newborn and infant health problems, but can also result in longterm illness and disabili ty, including chronic disease and developmental delays. And there are deep inequities in maternal and child hea lth by race: infant morta lity rates among African Americans are two to four times higher than whites and African American women are three to four times more likely to die from pregnancyrelated causes than white women. A dditionally women now face challenges to their reproductive freedom in a way that we have not seen since the i nitial debates that led to the passage of Roe v Wade in 1973. Ensuring access to comprehensive, low cost, repro ductive, prenatal and primary care - including family planning and abortion services, and case management wher e appropriate - will continue to be important, as will program and policy effort s that attempt to remedy the i mpact of neighborhood and social conditions on the health of women, their children, their partners and their famil ies, thereby securing the health and wellbeing of current and future generations. Support access to comprehensive, low cost and readily accessibl e reproductive health services, including family planning, emergency contraception and abortion services. Special attention should be paid to policies that 1) do not limit the range o f options available and 2) ensu re access to accurate, unbi ased information about reproductive and sexual health for youth and adults. Policy cha nges that have expanded access to health care for women and men of reproductive age must be maintained. Support level or increased funding for the Title V Maternal and Child Health Services block grant . For the PAGE | 122 Alameda County Federal Legislative Priorities 2018 last 80 years, Title V has provided a foundation for ensuring t he health of the nation's mothers, women, children and youth, including children and youth with special h ealth care needs. It is the only federal source of funds for populationbased matern al and child health improvemen t efforts. In Alameda County, Title V supports the Black Infant Health program, the Fetal and Infant Mortality Review program, SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome) Education, and other health education and promo tion efforts. Support full funding of the Title X Family Planning Program. For more than 40 years, Title X family planning clinics have played a critical role in ensuring access to a bro ad range of family planning and related preventive health services for millions of lowincome or uninsured individ uals and others. Title X cl inics are often the main source of primary care for lowincome women between pregnancies who do not qualify for MediCal. Support the continued ability of local health jurisdictions to draw down Title XIX money. Title XIX Medicaid monies are available for activities that link Medicaideligible individuals to care and are a significant source of funds for many services that reach lowincome women, children a nd families, including early childhood home visiting programs. Support the reauthorization of the Federal Healthy Start Act an d continued implementa tion of the Healthy Start program. The Healthy Start program is an initiative mandated to reduce t he rate of infant mortality, reduce disparities in perinatal health, and improve perinatal o utcomes through grants to project areas with high rates of infant mortality. I n Alameda County, the Healthy Start program has been in place since 1991. It provides case management, navigation and support services, heal th education and empowerment groups and neighborhoodbased interventions for low income, multistressed AfricanAmerican women, children and families in the zip codes with t he highest infant mortality rat es. Support legislation to ensure access to comprehensive contracep tive services and a ccurate inf ormation about reproductive health for both men and women. Oppose any efforts to restrict access to abortion and family planning services based on age, stage of pregnancy or an y other criteria. When women have control over their reproductive health and rates of unplanned pregnanci es are lower, their health and wellbeing is ensured, the health and life trajectory of their children is op timized and the social and economic conditions in which they are living are improved. Support continued funding for the Maternal, Infant, Early Child hood Home Visiting (MIECHV) program made available through the Affordable Care Act. The MIECHV monies support the Nurse Family Partnership (NFP) program in Alameda County. NFP is an evidencebased home visitation model, which has been shown to lead to better pregnancy outcomes, improved child health and de velopment, and increased economic self sufficiency - outcomes that contribute to preventing child abus e, reducing juvenile crime, and increasing school readiness. NFP is an integral and expanding part of Alameda Cou nty's home visiting system of care. Support efforts to ensure safe, s table and affordable housing f or pregnant women and families with young children. Pregnancy, infancy and early childhood are critical periods whe re adverse social conditions can have a disproportionate effect on health and development. Living in su bstandard housing, experiencing neighborhood violence or being homeless for even short periods of time durin g the early stages of life can expose young children and their families to dangerous levels of toxic stress , resulting in potential damage to their longterm health, wellbeing and overall life trajectory. Support legislation to enhance and support early childhood deve lopment such as comprehensive paid parental leave and universal preschool. Paid family leave enables parents to spend a minimum of six to eight weeks with newborns, which is recommended by physicians. Curren tly, fewer than 15 percent of workers have access to paid family leave and only half of firsttime mothers take any kind of leave around the time of their child's birth. Universal preschool legislation in other states, such as Oklahoma, have resulted in improved fourth grade reading scores, a strong predictor of high school graduat ion and overall success later in life. Support funding for the equitable inclusion of services for men in local family support systems of care . For decades publicly funded family support systems of care have pro vided services to ensure the health and well being of women and children. Federal and state funding is neede d to address the health and wellbeing of men and assure their inclusion in family support programming so tha t they can successfully engage with their families and children. This funding should be directed towards programs, agencies, and organizations that are open to and inclusive of the needs of men and that provide fath erspecific services and activities that further PAGE | 123 Alameda County Federal Legislative Priorities 2018 the goal of increasing fathers' involvement in their children's lives. Additionally, the County supports legislation to ensure full access to physical and mental health services fo r men, particularly for men reentering the community from the local cr iminal justice systems. COMMUNICABLE DISEASE CO NTROL AND PREVENTION Communicable diseases are among the top 10 leading causes of de ath in the United States and the fourth leading cause of death worldwide. Contro l of communicable disease is a core public safety function of government at the local, State, and federal levels. Fulfilling this function requ ires a sustained, adequately funded infrastructure that monitors, evaluates, and respond s to communicable disease threa ts. Communicable diseases are kept in control only through continual vigilance and ongoing efforts, even when a threat may not be apparent. In addition, the threat of bioterrorism requires Health Officers be prepared to recognize and respond to possible cases of intentional outbreaks of unusual diseases such as smallpox, pla gue, anthrax, or botulism. The three key activities of Communicable Disease Control a n d P r e v e n t i o n a r e e p i d e m i o l o g y and surveillance, communicable disease response, and vaccinepreventab le disease progr ams. Support for these key areas will help protect public health infrastructure and capacity to control and prevent communicable diseases in the County. Key federal priorities in 2018 are: Support and restore adequate funding for personnel with the cap acity for communicable disease control and prevention. Adequate funding is needed to recruit and retain experienced ma sters and doctoral level epidemiologists, nurse and medic al epidemiologists, public heal th investigators, bioinf ormaticists to analyze genomic sequencing data, and health educators. Personnel with t his training and experience are required to assure timely and effective investigation and response to outbr eaks, emerging infectious diseases, pandemics and bioterrorism events. Support increased funding for prevention programs dealing with Sexually Transmitted Disease such as partner services, preexposure p rophylaxis, early testing, and education and outreach. Maintain Ryan White funding for HIV services not covered in the Affordable Care Act. Maintenance of funding is also critical for ong oing local support and technic al assistance. Support restoration and augmentation of funding for tuberculosi s (TB) control and prevention . Adequate funding includes increased resources for treatment of costly an d dangerous multidrug resistant TB, treatment of latent tuberculosis infection as prevention of disease, adeq uate health care access and insurance coverage for all persons requiring tuberculosis assessment and treatment . Globally, TB is the leading cause of infectious death, killing more people than AIDS. In 2015, the US had the f irst national increase in TB cases since 1992. Despite these concerning trends, funding for the CDC's domestic TB program has been threatened by cuts, which will lead to funding cuts for State and local public heal th programs, leaving our communities vulnerable. Support improved systems and funding for screening and treatmen t of TB prior to the arrival of new immigrants in the United States. These systems must include follow up as well, and accessible, c ulturally competent health care access for evaluation and treatment of ne w immigrants once they have arrived. Maintain and support ongoing funding for pandemic influenza, an d administration of local preparedness programs. Ongoing financial support is needed to maintain critical servic es such as Public Health Emergency Preparedness, Health Care Prepa redness, Cities Readiness Initia tive, Urban Area Security Initiative, State Homeland Security Grant Program, and other crucial funding for emerging infectious diseases, natural disasters, and terrorism planning and response. Support policies that assure access to vaccines for the populat ion. Policies must assure access to immunizations, public education and outreach regarding immuniza tions, and improve immunization rates or require immunizations in key settings such as schools and other settings with vulnerable populations and/or high risk of exposures. Support policies and funding that provide resources to adapt an d develop locally relevant and culturally competent public education and outreach regarding communicable diseases, immunizations, and public health emergency preparedness and response. The broad diversity of local communities requires the capability to communicate in culturally relevant modes to ensur e the education and safety of all residents. PAGE | 124 Alameda County Federal Legislative Priorities 2018 Promote & support policies and practices to prevent healthcare associated infections and antibiotic resistance. Healthcare associated infections (HAI) are infections acquired while receiving health care. They are increasingly becoming a significant cause of morbidity and mort ality in the U.S., and a substantial public health challenge. These infections are preventable and require robust programs and policies in order to reduce or eliminate HAIs. Effective policies and programs are also needed to strengthen the response to antimicrobial resistance, such as enhanced coordination and leadership, surve illance, prevention and control, and research efforts for new antibiotics and implementation of antibiotic st ewardship programs to improve appropriate use of antibiotics across multiple h ealth, industrial and food prod uction systems. DISASTER PREPAREDNESS Natural and humanmade disasters including the recent fires in California, earthquakes, acts of terrorism, projections of more frequent and severe extreme weather events and emerging communicable diseases demonstrate the need to ensure that Alameda County has a coordi nated system in place to respond to any hazard. Building the response capacity of public health, emergency medi cal services and health care systems includes planning for a \"surge\" of patients. The Public Health Departmen t and Emergency Medical Services (EMS) continue to work in collaboration with County, State and Federal agencie s, local health care providers and other institutions to strengthen our collaboration, communications and responsiven ess. The following will ens ure that our State and local disaster response systems are adequately prepared to resp ond in an emergency, prepared to respond to longterm health issues from disaster, and prepared to maintain continuity of operations: Support funding for regional communications. Regional planning must take place to develop communication s y s t e m s t h a t a r e f u n c t i o n a l i n a m u t u a l a i d r e s p o n s e s i t u a t i o n . Clear leadership provided by the State Department of Public Health and EMS Authority should promote im proved communication with the public and private sector. Funding is needed to support robust and redunda nt systems and enhance existing communications and information management systems. Develop systems for vulnerable populations. D e v e l o p a n d f u n d s y s t e m s t o e n s u r e t h a t s e r v i c e s a r e delivered in a timely and efficient manner to vulnerable popula tions with special consideration for children and adults with disabilities requirin g functional or access support services, as well as low income populations, seniors, children, individuals with language barriers and other specific needs. Preplanning for disaster response must be focused on those who are dependent on others such as ca retakers in the event of a largescale public health emergency. Secure funding for disaster preparedness, response and mitigati on. Support legislation that promotes funding for medical and health disaster planning, coordination, response and mitigation including infrastructure and emergency response personnel. REDUCING INEQUITIES IN CHRONIC DISEASES In Alameda County the 4 leading causes of death: cancer, heart disease, stroke, and chronic lower Respiratory Disease, are due to chronic diseases and account for 57 percent of all deaths. Diabetes and Hypertension account for another 5.7 percent of deaths. Despite overall incr eases in life expectancy among all racial/ethnic groups, there has been a growing disparity in life expectancy r ates. For example in 1960 AfricanAmericans in Alameda County had a life expectancy 4.0 years less than Caucas ians and in 2010 despite marked increases in both racial/ethnic groups the disparity had increased to 6.5 ye ars. Support chronic disease screening, detection, education and car e management system Chronic diseases disproportionally affect people of color. Poor screening, acces s to care, and the lack of understanding of how to manage these diseases leads to complications and premature deat h. The County supports expanding and enforcing a chronic disease syst em of care that includes the pa yment for and provision of selfmanagement education to people with chronic diseases. PAGE | 125 Alameda County Federal Legislative Priorities 2018 Protect and support child nutriti on standards and efforts to ex pand access to food assistance programs and increase benefits through the Farm Bill and Child Nutrition Reauthorization - Streamline systems to automatically refer MediCal recipients to SNAP and WIC or auto matically qualify for SNAP and WIC. Advocate for California to be able to use a separate income guideline al igned to the higher cost of living, as Hawaii and Alaska has done. Increase the value of WIC food packets, extend ing infant certification to age 2, extend child eligibility to age 6, and extend benefits to nonbreastfeeding mothers until the child turns 1. Promote the initiation and prolonged duration of breastfeeding - Breastfeeding has been proven to provide a broad range of health benefits to both baby and mother includ ing reducing a child's chance of becoming overweight or obese. Encouraging and supporting breastfeeding, and enforcing laws that protect lowwage workers, allow family leave, foster child bonding, and create b reastfeedingfriendly work places will lay a foundation of good health. Limit the marketing of junk food to children - The Institute of Medicine recently issued a comprehensive lis t of recommendations to combat the obesity crisis, including the creation of guidelines to limit the marketing of junk food to children. In recent years this marketing has incre ased greatly, particularly concentrated in low income communities, leading to an increase in childhood obesity and its associated diseases. Improve utilization of food assistance programs - The complexity of applying for and maintaining eligibility for food assistance programs is frequently a barrier to lowinc ome families. Streamlining the application for nutrition programs SNAP (formerly Food Stamps), Women, Infant s and Children (WIC), and School Meals Program (Breakfast/Lunch) would g reatly increase the numbers of children served. Create \"AsthmaFriendly\" communities: Support policies that create \"AsthmaFriendly\" communities, especially those that eliminate the disproportionate burden of a s t h m a f o r p e o p l e l i v i n g i n p o v e r t y a n d communities of color. This goal can be achieved through optimiz ing the diagnosis, treatment, and management of asthma by adherence to the current National Heart Lung and B lood Institute's asthma guidelines; expanding the reach of proven case management programs for serving person s with asthma; utilizing community health workers and trained professionals; improving air quality reduci ng diesel emissions in our communities, and improving housing conditions to meet the standards of a healthy home while holding those responsible for the conditions to a legal standard. Expand the availability of healthful foods and beverages, and d ecrease the availability of unhealthful foods and beverages. Healthful and nutritious foods and beverages must be made more easily available in low income neighborhoods paired with a decrease in access to unheal thful foods and beverages. The USDA's programs to increase access to healthful foods should be expand ed and greater financial incentives and/or assistance should be provided to retailers to implement the cha nges. ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH To ensure environmental quality an d food safety in the communit y, the County supports policies and legislation that would prioritize the following: Policies and funding that promotes environmental health and jus tice. People of color and lowincome communities are disproportionately impacted by environmental po llution and climate change, particularly children and elderly. Environment al pollution, including condit ions of blight and climate change degrades and poses added risks to the environ ment and public health. Support policies and funding that uses a \"precautionary approach,\" prevents and mitigates environmental pollution, increases monitoring and enforcement action, creates green jobs and spurs the green econ omy, and seeks to meaningfully involve community residents most impacted by pollution decisionmaking in order to address health disparities, cumulative health impacts and further environmental justice. Legislation that regulates the shipment and processing of fossi l fuels for local use or export to reduce local impacts to health and safety. Changes in the fossil fuel industry have resulted in plans by p roducers to increase exports of coal and liquid petroleum products by rail to seapor ts. Rail incidents involving crude oil jumped nearly sixteen fold nationally between 2010 and 2014. Fossil fu els transported by rail to port facilities in PAGE | 126 Alameda County Federal Legislative Priorities 2018 Alameda County would disproportionately impact the health of lo wincome communities of color but provide little benefit to those communiti es. Greater federal oversight is needed to regulate shipments in order to ensure the safety and heal th of all County residents. Effective Product Stewardship/ Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) legislation. EPR is a strategy that shifts the responsibility for end of life/residual management t o the producers by internalizing the cost of collection and disposal in the pr ice of the product. This inclu des, but is not limited to, existing and emerging waste streams such as pharmaceuticals, sharps, household batter ies, fluorescent lamps and marine flares. Effective product stewardship legislation should apply to all m anufacturers across a particular product spectrum, have required minimum collection rates, increasing co llection goals over the course of the program, no line item fee at the point of purchase or fee at the point o f surrender and no local preemption clause. Toxics Reduction and Environmental Health. The release of toxic chemicals into our environment impacts human health and the health of the ecosystems on which our comm unities rely. Policies to address this issue include: 1) Health Equity. Suppo rt policies and funding for pro grams that prevent and mitigate the disproportionate environmental a nd health impacts of pollution and vehicular traffic th rough and within low income communities, including commodities being transported suc h as coal and oil. Support policies and funding to reduce the costs of utilities and reduce health burd ens of pollution on all communities; 2) Reducing Toxics Impact. Support legislation and programs that reduce the a m o u n t o f c h e m i c a l s r e l e a s e d i n t o o u r environment and that impact worker health including, but not li mited to, sustainable agriculture practices, integrated pest management, and microplastic pollution. Oppose policies and practices th at allow industry to unduly influence the assessment o f the health or environmental impacts of chemicals for the purposes of regulatory decision making; and 3) Regulating Dangerous Chemica ls. Support policies to speed the evaluation of potentially dangerous chemicals, to regulate classes of chemica ls, not just individual chemicals, known to have adverse impacts on human health, and reform the federal Toxic S ubstances Control Act to better protect human and environmental health.

Support adoption of full service community schools, resources f or coordination of learning supports (i.e. community school coordinators), and promotion of partners hips between youth, families, schools, communitybased organizations, businesses, and other entities. Support increased funding for full service community schools through the adoption of comprehensive and sus tainable education revenues and a reform package that establishes an equitable, adequate finance system that ensures transparency, continues to enable greater local decisionmaking fl exibility, and strengthens huma n capital and accountability. The County supports efforts that increase a ccess to violence prevention pr ograms and services, including programs that promote healthy interpersonal relationships. Sustain and support policies that prevent the school to prison pipeline that disproportionately affects low income students of color and students with disabilities. Provide funding for programs and services particularly in schools with low academic performance, low income students o f color, and particularly for African American and Latino males. Provide funded mandates for schools to create an absenteeism and truancy early warning system that identifies frequently absent children and connects them and their families to comprehensive, wraparound services and interventions, such as coordinated medi cal care, behavioral and mental health services, youth development programs, parent, family and commun ity engagement programs. Increase funding for programs such as male involvement programs and mentoring th at aim to reduce disparities in early literacy skills, graduation rates, and dropout rates for lowincome stud ents and students of color, particularly boys of color. Ensure students with disabilities have equitable access to educ ational opportunities. Improve the identification rate of students with disabilities to promote eq ual access to education. The County supports strengthening the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, legislation designed to ensure that students with disabilities are provided with education that is tailore d to their individual needs and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, which prohibits discrimination based on dis ability. PAGE | 128 Alameda County Federal Legislative Priorities 2018 Support policies and practices that abolish the use of physical force and seclusion and eliminate the disproportionate suspension and expulsion rates among students of color and students with disabilities. Eliminate punitive and zero tolerance policies and preschool su spensions. Supports legislation that builds positive school climates, funding threetiered behavioral healt h supports (i.e., universal, targeted and individual supports), staff and teacher training and consultati on for the creation of trauma/ healinginformed classrooms and schools, to foster early intervention alternativ es to expulsions and suspensions, and reforms in suspension policies for defiance at all grade levels, particula rly for African American students, and Latino and Pacific Islander males. Also support policies that increase transparency, accountability and professional development of administrators and teachers including training i n restorative practices, diversity, inclusion and mental health with a focus on traumainformed care. Protect and promote health and wellness among all students and healthy school environments. Increase access to safe, appropriate health, dental and mental health se rvices within schools, i ncluding schoolbased health centers, particularly for students of color and students in families with mixed immigration status, and increased funding flexibility for County services and for build ing teacher and parental awareness of sexually exploited minors. The County supports comprehensive wellness po licies and funding that reduce chronic diseases (such as asthma and diabetes), communicable disease (s uch as sexually transmitted infections (STI's)), promotes policies and programs aimed at decreasing teen pregnan cy and STI's, particularly among youth of color, and that reduce childhood obesity and other physical act ivity and dietrelated diseases.

IMMIGRATION The County supports federalleve l policies that achieve the fol lowing: Support deferred action programs and other efforts to make immi gration relief available: Support policies and programs like deferred action that enables eligible immigra nts to register with the government, request a reprieve from removal, and apply for a temporary work permit. Protect the health and welfare of children and children whose p arents are being detained or deported by Immigration Customs Enforcement (ICE) or Border Patrol: The County supports policies that protect children o f p a r e n t s d e t a i n e d o r d e p o r t e d w i t h i n t h e c u r r e n t s y s t e m . A d d i tionally, the County supports policies prioritizing the needs and welfare of children by prioritizing the following: family unity, resources for unaccompanied immigrant youth, creating appropriate, humanitari an, transparent and a ccountable training policies and protocols for interacting with and screening child ren. End all detention and deportation programs : The County supports reforms that reduce the negative impacts of detention and deportation programs on public safety, civil l iberties, public health, and the conditions of detainees. The County supports: (1) policies to limit transfers , holds and interviews in local jails and reduce the risk and fear of deportation; (2) policies that reinforce and s trengthen privacy protecti ons for state residents; and that promote the constitutio nal and civil rights of patient s, students, workers and individuals seeking critical services in the event of an immigration enforcement ac tion; and (3) programs within detention centers that increase access to medical services for all detainees, and that provide support to all detainees in their native language. Protect against racial profiling based on \"perceived\" immigrati on status, ethnicity, religion, language or national origin: The County supports legislation that identifies and eliminates racial profiling in the public and private sectors. Increase access to culturally and linguistically appropriate be havioral health and health care for PAGE | 129 Alameda County Federal Legislative Priorities 2018 immigrants: The County supports legislation that increases equitable access to quality, affordable, and culturally and linguistically appropriate health care coverage and services, and incl udes all categories of immigrants not covered by the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The Co unty supports policies and funding to reduce the barriers to enrollment of undocumented and other uninsured immigrants in Medicare and policies to streamline, integrate and coordinate services and providers, su ch as a onestop approach. Promote public safety by supporting policies to ensure that rep orting crimes, including domestic violence, to local authorities, does not l ead to deportation proceedings. The county supports work with local law enforcement to help ensure that reporting of crimes does not le ad to deportation or other adverse consequences. Protect and promote the wellbeing of immigrant workers, includ ing undocumented workers: The County supports legislation that protects immigrant workers, especiall y vulnerable undocumented population, from wage theft, and extends important labor standards to jobs predo minantly occupied by immigrants. The county also supports legislation that protects immigrant workers from immigrationrelated retaliation by their employers. Ensure nondiscriminatory, equal treatment under the law, and pr otect the confidentiality and privacy of individuals: The County supports actions that affirmatively extend access to public services and benefits to all residents, regardless of immigration status, limit inquiries an d reduce the collection and recording of information about immigration status, and prohibit the disclosu re of information about persons seeking or receiving social services for purposes not directly related to administering the program or protecting individual or public health.

The County supports prioritizing family unity, resources for unaccompanied immigran t youth, and appropriate, humanitarian training policies and protocols for interacting with and screening child ren. We support policies and programs that e n s u r e t h e r i g h t t o a n a t t o r n e y during immigration proceedings for immigrant adults, families and unaccompanied immigrant youth, and the provision of funding to ensure free legal assistance. JOBS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT CREATE A STRONG AND ROBUST JOBDRIVEN SYSTEM Invest in Systems and Policies that Support Workers and Employe rs Preserve and enhance Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act ( WIOA) Funding. Support preserving and fully restoring WIOA funding. WIOA is a federal law passed in 2 014, which reauthorized the nation's employment and training programs related to adult, dislocated w orkers and youth, as well as adult education and vocational rehabilitation pr ograms created under the Workfo rce Investment Act (WIA). With recent deep budget cuts across all WIOA progr am areas, some of the goals of the legislation are unlikely to be met. Additional funding is needed to continue implementation of WIOA . At the core of WIOA is an emphasis on facilitating access to highquality training programs that lead to industryrecognized valued credentials/certificates within highgrowth industries and occu pations. To accomplish this, specific funding is needed to develop better coordinated training programs for job seekers. More funding is needed for enhanced PAGE | 130 Alameda County Federal Legislative Priorities 2018 supportive services for job seekers, increased stipends for you th participants in workbased learning programs, and for the coordination and alignment of Local Workforce Devel opment Boards (LWDBs), California Community College Districts, Adult Schools/Adult Consortium, K 12 education, and Economic Development agencies. Invest in education that prepares individuals for the 21st century workforce. Support the alignment of the education and workforce investment systems to meet the needs of the 21st century workforce, which promotes a n d d e v e l o p s a w e l l e d u c a t e d a n d h i g h l y s k i l l e d w o r k f o r c e . A s p ecial effort should be made to support education in the Science, Technology, Education, and Math (STEM ) areas and other career within highgrowth sectors and occupations. Support affordable higher education. Support affordable higher education that provides greater acces s to people seeking credentials and degrees. The cost of college oft en poses a hardship to graduates and a barrier to people trying to enter higher education to pursue career int e r e s t s . R e s e a r c h s h o w s t h e s t a g g e r i n g difference in income between people who pursue some form of hig her education as opposed to those who don't, and that 48 percent of occupations in the Country will b e middleskills jobs by the year 2024 and 43 percent in California. Middlesk ills jobs require more than a h igh school education but less than a fouryear degree, so investments in Career Technical Education (CTE) are critical. The success of the economy will partially rely on how well job seekers are prepared to compete within the economy. Alameda County supports affordable higher education that prepares workers to succeed in the labor market. Support fair, sustainable, and nonstagnant wages. Support policies that aim to create livable wages, promote income mobility, and close the gender and racial wage g aps. Alameda County supports wage growth and policies/strategies that promote income mobility, in order to combat wage stagnation. Support fair scheduling policies. Support fair scheduling policies that give workers sufficient t ime to make alternative arrangements in thei r schedules, if needed. Partti me workers are subject to last minute scheduling changes, affecting their ability to find child care in a timely manner or make transportation arrangements putting worker's jobs at risk. Promote job creation and economic development. Support policies and programs that create local jobs. Specifically, Alameda County supports tax incentives, innovativ e funding mechanisms to support public/private partnerships, waivers, support for small businesses and entrepr eneurs, and policies that promote/support locallymade products. Policies s hould increase resources for \" proactive\" business assistance programs that prevent closures and mitigate job loss. Support integrated and supported employment opportunities for i ndividuals with disabilities in alignment with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Support inclusive policies and programs that provide integrated employment opportunities for individuals with disabi lities, as well as proper accommodations and supports in the workplace. Extend workplace rights, protect ions, and resources to all vict ims of crime. All victims should be treated with dignity and respect by their employer and should have acce ss to reasonable time off to receive medical treatment and recover from the crime. Alameda County supports p olicies that assist victims of crime in maintaining employment, while receiving the proper stabilizatio n services. Support resources and policies that promote workforce alignment activities articulated in Alameda County Workforce Development Board's Regional and Local Plan. Support and reaffirm the Regional and Local Plan of the Alameda County Workforce Development Board (ACWDB), which a cts as a strategic road map for the implementation of the WIOA. The Regional and Local Plan calls f or collaborative partnerships that strengthen training outcomes and employment outcomes, and services to job seekers, while enhancing employer engagement and services in Alameda County. Support preapprenticeship and apprenticeship programs. Support robust preapprenticeship and apprenticeship programs that prepare youth and adults for emplo yment within high growth industries and occupations. The apprenticeship m odel is a tried and true appro ach for helping job seekers simultaneously find meaningful training while earning a sustainable wage. Preappre nticeships prepare participants for competitive apprenticeship programs and equip youth and adults with both so ft and hard skill development, as well as mentorship opportunities from industry experts. PAGE | 131 Alameda County Federal Legislative Priorities 2018 Support the alignment between workforce development, adult educ ation, and the community college districts. Support the alignment between th e existing partners in the work force system, as education and workforce are inextricably linked and together to support the s uccess of current and future workers. Coordination and alignment in the workforce system will streaml ine services and reduce duplication of efforts, and will set the state for colla borative and innovative partner ships. Reauthorize the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education (CTE) Act. Reauthorization of the Carl D. Perkins CET Act is essential to support career technical educat ion at the local level within the California Community College Districts, which can be leveraged by WIOA for further operationalization of high quality CTE programs. CTE programs and cou rses are aligned with industry ne eds and result in the attainment of industry recognized certificates and cred entials that can offer quicker onramps to the labor market. Reauthorize the Higher Education Act (HEA). Reauthorization of the HEA is essential in establishing the government's commitment to higher education. The existing liter ature around HEA reauthorization points to possible alignment between HEA and WIOA, specifically around wo rkforcerelated outcomes, the attainment of industryrecognized credentials/c ertificates, the expansion of workbased learning opportunities, the development and expansion of sector partnerships, and increased employer engagement in the design of educational programs/curriculum. Alignment can promote a closer knit relationship between higher education and workforce, and would establish better outcomes for students as they enter t he labor force. Support Individuals with Barriers to Employment Support policies that create empl oyment and educational opportu n i t i e s f o r l o n g t e r m u n e m p l o y e d workers, individuals with disabilities, returning/reentry popu lations, lowincome adul ts, marginally attached workers, atrisk youth, and older workers. Support subsidized employment, supportive services, summer and yearround employment opportunities for youth (including yo uth in foster care), and programs/resources to help lowincome adults, CalWORKs clients, Limited English Pr oficient (LEP) clients, re entry populations, marginally attached populations, and older workers obtain the p roper education and training leading to employment and income mobility. Support programs that develop and/or enhance employment and edu cational services to Limited English Proficient (LEP) and immigrants populations. Support programs that create a ccess to employment, training, and supportive services for LEP and immigrant populations, as w ell as legislation that promotes the alignment between WIOA and the Development, Relief, and Education for Ali en Minors (DREAM) Act programs, to support the educational attainment of immigrant and foreignborn indivi duals. Policies should support the partnership between the LWDBs and entities carrying out DREAM A ct programs. Support and expand workforce development efforts that promote c areer pathways and address racial, cultural, and economic disparities in employment outcomes. Support inclusive programs and policies that help prepare and integrate communities of color, individuals ex periencing homelessness, lowincome populations, immigrant and migrant workers, older adults, indiv iduals with disabilities, reentry populations (including women who have been formerly incarcerated), veterans , and other individuals with barriers to employment into the workforce. Expand support of Adult Schools and programs that offer basic a nd remedial skill attainment for individuals who need onramps into sustainablewage careers. Support programs and initiatives that provide remediation and supportive servic es designed to help individual s who need basic skills training in order to be successful. Increase employment opportunities for older adults and individu als with disabilities. Support policies that combat ageism in the work place against older workers and polic ies that combat discrimination against individuals with disabilities. Alameda County supports innovati ve programs that help older adults and individuals with disabilities access training and employment op portunities that lead to competitive and integrated employment. Specifically, we support policies such a s subsidized employment or tax incentives that encourage employers to hire older adults and individuals with d isabilities. Remove the criminal background check requirement from initial j ob application requirements. Support PAGE | 132 Alameda County Federal Legislative Priorities 2018 policies and legislation that support fair hiring for formerly incarcerated individuals, as well as strategies and policies designed to reduce recidivism. Economic opportunity is greatly diminished for formerly incarcerated individuals (who are disproporti onately people of color) becaus e of employment discrimination. California and the federal government should pass broad \"Ban the Box\" legislat ion that requires an employer to determine a job applicant's minimum qualifications before obtaining and con sidering information regarding the applicant's conviction history. Support programs and policies that prepare formerly incarcerate d individuals for employment before release. Support programs and policies that are designed to help formerl y incarcerated individuals prepare for employment opportunities before release, offering them a greate r chance to succeed in the labor market. Evidence points to customized job readiness strategies and tran sitional jobs as promising strategies for helping reentry populations readjust, as well as services that addres s mental and behavioral health. Alameda County supports innovative programs that provide relevant intervention s to help reentry clients become contributing members of their comm unities and society. Provide access to federal financial aid for individuals with pr evious drugrelated offenses. The opportunity to go to college and improve one's economic position is limited for those with previous drug offenses because they do not have access to federal student aid. Evidence shows that recidivism is greatest when individuals do not have access to employment an d educational opportunities. Al ameda County supports removing restrictions on financial aid so that all individuals can have the opportunity to continue their education and become contributing members to the economy and society. Expand Opportunities for Youth Invest in intensive summer progr ams geared toward work readines s and STEMrelated occupations. Support initiatives, policies, and programs designed to help yo uth prepare for employment, apprenticeships and higher education. Summer workreadiness programs geared tow ard STEMrelated occupations, and/or other indemand occupations, provide applied learning opportuni ties and ongoing engagement during summer time, where lowincome youth are specifically atrisk for losin g ground in their education. Summer time can be leveraged to help vulnerable youth learn while gaining valuable work experience, boosting their confidence and helping youth perform better in the academic school year or whi le pursuing an internship/apprenticeship opportunity. Summer programs also expose youth to careers that will pave their way into career pathways and other earnandlearn opportunities offered yearlong. Preserve, support, and expand programs that serve young people. Support investments in programs and services targeted at young peopl e both in and ou tofschool to assist them in their career and educational development. Specifically, programs should target young people who are atrisk for dropping out of school or have left school, foster youth, homeless youth, juvenile justic e involved youth, and othe r youth with barriers to employment. Preserve, support and expand pro g r a m s t h a t i n v o l v e p a r e n t s / g u a r d i a n s i n t h e w o r k f o r c e p r o g r a m s . Support twogeneration strategies that improve the education an d career readiness of youth, while simultaneously improving the education and career readiness of parents/guardians. Alameda County supports the dual engagement and education of parents/guardians and stud ents in decisions related to career path development for youth, including breaking myths related to high er education and training opportunities. Parent/guardians and students should have the most relevant and accurate information to arrive at decisions related to career pathways. Students should feel supported in pursuing prospective careers, while maintaining a sense of autonomy. Support programs designed to reduce the youth unemployment rate and provide/enhance relevant work experience. One year estimates for youth unemployment in Alameda County for youth ages 1619 is 14.8 percent and 8.3 percent for yout h ages 2024, translating rough ly as 23 times greater than the overall unemployment rate in Alameda Co unty. Employment opportunities for youth can be a protective factor, helping youth to form positive interpersonal relationships, build confidence, and relevant work experience. Connecting this early work experi ence to training opportunities and highgrowth career pathways can lead to successful outcomes later in adul thood. Alameda County support s programs and initiatives designed to reduce the youth unemployment rate and strengthen work experien ces that lead to highgrowth career pathways. PAGE | 133 Alameda County Federal Legislative Priorities 2018 Support youth voice in program design and implementation. Support the integration of youth vice and perspective in the development and implementation of workforce development programs and initiatives. A humancentered design perspective illuminates the importance of designthinking and involves client voice at the forefront of program development. It also leverages that s ame voice throughout the testing, operationalizing, and evaluation of programs. Reinstate a federal summer youth employment program. Support summer youth employment programs that promote positive youth deve lopment and opportunities to ex plore career pathways and workbased learning especially for vulnerable youth populations. Although m a n y y o u t h a r e e a g e r t o w o r k a n d b e g i n building their skills, few resources are available to initiate programs specifically focused on populations in low income communities or distressed neighborhoods, where job oppor tunities are declining. Summer jobs programs traditionally strive to deliver the first work experie nce to young adults and prepare them for work as they learn soft skills, career awareness, and some basic skills . IMPROVING HEALTH OUTCOMES BY A DDRESSING SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS The County supports the following policies in order to improve the economic and health outcomes of all its residents: Enact a higher federal minimum wage: Increasing the income of lowwage workers is fundamental to positive health outcomes because it provides access to importan t healthenabling resources, including proper nutrition, good medical care, stable health insurance, and favo rable housing \u2014 all of which can be leveraged to avoid risks and protect health. Create policy that closes looph oles and includes cost of living increases. Federal services that are dependent on fixed rates should be adequately funded to ensure continued service provision. Protect worker health and safety: Strengthen existing laws and enforcement for worker health and safety. Strengthen existing laws and enforcement for worker health and safety, including paid sick days and family leave. Support policies to ensure healthy and safe working cond itions and to prevent unnecessary harmful exposures for all workers; this includes increasing funding for enforcement, penalties for violators of health and safety laws, and meaningful regu lations of dangerous chemicals. Protect and expand worker's rights: Enact federal legislation that p rotects and strengthens workers ' right to organize and collectively bargain, such as labor peace agreemen ts and cardcheck and neutrality agreements. This includes protecting the rights of temporary and contingent workers and supporting policies that require fair and stable work schedules. Support efforts to educate work ers, including youth and immigrants, about worker rights. Restore civil rights protections and reduce barriers for former ly incarcerated people in the workplace : Formerly incarcerated individuals often struggle to access qual ity employment because of barriers maintained by State policy. The County suppo rts policies that enable forme rly incarcerated individuals to access quality jobs and economic stability such as \"ban the box/ fairchance h iring policies. Increase access to entrepreneurship opportunities: (1) Support small businesses and microenterprise, especially women and minorityowned businesses, through expandi ng fair access to safe and sustainable credit and capital , and allow microenterprise to serve as an e ligible activity for recipients for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) and Social Security Disabi lity Insurance; (2) Support co operatives and create incentives for employee ownership through policies that promote sound business conversion to cooperative bu siness models, as well as removing barriers to starting coopera tive businesses; and (3) Support policies that expand access to capital among entreprene urs of color and persons with disabilities, such as adapting the New Markets Tax Credit and the Small Business A dministration loans program to target those businesses. Improve the quality of lowwage jobs and provide pathways to mi ddlewage jobs: Enforce and modernize labor laws, closing loopholes that allow employers to misclassi fy workers as independent contractors and PAGE | 134 Alameda County Federal Legislative Priorities 2018 preventing wage theft. Support s trategies to establish sectorb ased training programs and pipelines from apprenticeships and credentialin g programs to industries with j ob growth, and improved career navigation systems. Preserve and expand the social safety net: The County supports strong safe ty net programs, including better funding and reform of unemployment insurance to cover mo re workers, adequate benefits for disability and workers compensation programs, and public benefits. Establish standards for public dollars to be invested equitably for economic opportunity: Resources should be targeted to areas where susta ined disinvestment has produced concentrated poverty and lack of opportunity. Government spending can be used to shift more indu stries towards providing better wages and benefits. In addition, the Count y supports supplier diversity p olicies - which require businesses to engage in proactive and measureable effort s to provide diverse suppliers equal access to contracting opportunities. Ensure equitable taxation: Tax code benefits accrue to the wealthiest 5 percent of taxpaye rs and largely miss the assetpoor majority in this country. Meaningful incent ives to save for residents of all income groups should be provided, and the tax system should benefit all resid ents equally. Successful tax credits, such as the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) should be expanded to continue lifting people out of poverty across the nation. Protect and support asset and wealthbuilding efforts while reg ulating against unfair financial practices and reforming the banking industry : Policies and practices that prevent predatory financial pract ices, increase access to quality financial services and products, and support financial literacy will help to protect and build wealth.

SUSTAINABILITY, CLIMA TE CHANGE, AND ENERGY OPENING Alameda County maintains a strong commitment to ensuring that f ederal legislation works to preserve our nation's natural resources and protect our public health. It is imperati ve that federal policy protects our country from the physical, economic and public health effects of climate change while also providing pathways to economic prosperity. In 2018, it is critical that the nation does not step backwards to unwind 40 years of environmental and public health progress by weakening or dismantling regulations or rend ering federal regulatory agencies ineffective by cutting funding and resources or allowing industry to unduly in fluence sound environmental decision making. Federal legislative efforts must focus on making meaningful com mitments to establishing targets to reduce carbon pollution and shifting towards a deeply decarbonized energy sy stem while also considering environmental justice and equity for all citizens. CLIMATE CHANGE Adaptation, Mitigation, and Resilience. Support policies and increased funding to help prepare local governments, communities, and bus inesses to fight climate chang e and to adapt to changes in the climate while also building resilient communities.

Fossil Fuel Extraction. Oppose legislation that opens public lands and oceans for drill ing, mining, and fracking or provides tax breaks, financial incentives, or subsidies to o il, gas, and coal industries. National Transition to Clean Power. Support legislation that sets the country on an aggressive path towards a deeplydecarbonized energy supply. Support policies that harn ess the research capabilities and resources of the national labs; federal, stat e, and local agencies; and the free market to accelerate this transition. ENVIRONMENT, AGRICULTURE , AND NATURAL RESOURCES Clean Air and Water Protection. Oppose legislation that reduces the strength of the Clean Air a nd Clean Water Acts to protect our public health and our environment or that limits the ability of state and local governments to adopt regulatory standards more stringent than t he federal level. Enforcement of Current Laws . Ensure that existing environmental legislation and regulatory structures are not dismantled or weakened; protect the ability of federal agen cies such as the EPA, DOJ, and DOI to enforce environmental regulations and protect public health; and ensure that regulatory agencies are not rendered ineffective from lack of fundin g, resources, or authority.

SUSTAINABLE TRANSPORTATION Transportation systems and techno logies have some of the greate st impacts on the health of communities, local air quality, and global climate change. Federal legislative pri orities on transportation infrastructure, modes of transportation, deployment of more sustainable technologies, an d access to public transit can be found in the Federal Legislative Priorities Transportation chapter of the 2018 Legislative Platform. PAGE | 140 Alameda County Federal Legislative Priorities 2018 TOXICS REDUCTION AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH The release of toxic chemicals into our environment impact huma n health and the health of the ecosystems on which our communities rely.

Recycling. Support policies, legislation, and funding to expand domestic r ecycling infrastructure, develop markets for recycled materials, and support local collection pr ograms. TRANSPORTATION TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE The federal government is an important partner in delivering lo callydeveloped transportation projects. At the local level, counties see the direct impact of federal dollars spent on transportation. In addition to moving goods and people, federal transportati on investments are major econom ic drivers for local communities. However, in order to plan and execute large and smallscale transportation projects that are critical to commerce and the American quality of life, coun ties need longterm funding certa inty and a reliable federal partner. The ability of local jurisdictions to effectively plan, maintai n and deliver projects for the country's transportation infrastructure system requires the assurance of a reliable and robust Highway Trust Fund in the coming years. The Fixing America's Surface Transpo rtation Act (FAST Act) ensured solvency of the Highway Trust Fund through 2020, however, the federal gas tax has lost its purchasing power sinc e it was last increased in 1993. It is critical that a new surface transportation authorization provide longterm fund ing certainty, which includes direct subventions for counties to address significant infrastructure issues on th e federalaid system, includi ng locally owned bridges and safety needs. The County supports policie s and legislation that: Ensure longterm funding certainty. Support the reauthorization and implementation of the provision s of FAST Act in an equitable manner that promotes equitable funding levels, programming roles, and local discretion in allocation decisions. Support legislation which p rotects local receipt of federal transportation and infrastructure funds and enhances revenues for investments in t he national transportation infrastructure. Support direct subventions for counties to address significant infrastructure issues on the federalaid system, including locally owned b ridges and safety needs. Maximize innovative funding and financing methods. Declining transportation revenues require innovating solutions to help local governments stretch federal, State and local investments farther. Support maximizing the use and flexibility of federal funds by not requiring minim um federal matches, eliminating the need to program multiple phases for small projects, and eliminating the need for TIP programming for air quality neutral projects. Rural road safety. Support policies and legislation that increase safety on the ex isting transportation system, with an emphasis on programs/projects focused on reducing injur ies and fatalities. Support policies and regulations that ensure a dedica ted funding source for all rura l road safety proj ects and programs. Streamline project delivery. Regulatory inefficiencies conti nue to hamper the effective and timely delivery of local transportation projects. S upport legislation that builds on reforms that strive to expedite project delivery, that continue and expand efforts to streamline and expedite pro ject delivery by maintaining the categorical PAGE | 141 Alameda County Federal Legislative Priorities 2018 exclusion for projects receiving limited federal assistance ($5 million or less), and that simplifies the process for pursuing categorical exclusions . Support the approval of a Stat efederal \"reciprocity\" pilot program which allows the State of California and the local transportation age ncies to carry out federal environmental review processes to streamline and expedite delivery of federally fund ed projects. ONGOING FUNDING FOR I580 CO RRIDOR IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS The I580 corridor in the TriValley is one of the most traffic congested locations in the Bay Area region. It serves as a key interregional gateway between the Bay Area and the Centr al Valley for goods movement and workforce commute travel. Although it has dropped out of the Top 10, this chronic condition has resulted in multiple locations along I580 still being in the Top 50 most congested Bay Area corridors, as identified in the annual report jointly published by Caltrans and the Metropolitan Transportati on Commission (MTC). This congestion will worsen as traffic volumes in this corri dor are projected to increase 9 0 percent by 2030. To respond to the existing and projected congestion, Alameda Co unty Transportation Commission (Alameda CTC) has identified a series of planned improvements for this corrid or. Over the years, a number of these improvements have been implemented, including t he construction of both eastb ound and westbound HOT lanes, and a new interchange at Isabel/SR 84 in Livermore. Other improvements in clude the completion of the auxiliary lane system and an eastbound truck climbing lane. Projects in the planning stage include the reconstru ction of the existing I 580/I680 interchange, and a BART connection to the Altamont Co mmuter Express (ACE) interregional passenger rail. Additionally, in October 2017, AB 758 established the Tri ValleySan Joaquin Valley Regional Rail Authority for purposes of planning, developing, and delivering costeffective and responsive transit connectivity between the BART's rapid transit system and the Altamont Corridor Express ( ACE) commuter rail service in the TriValley. Alameda County continues its s upport of the ongoing funding for the I580 Corridor Improvement Projects. SUSTAINABLE TRANSPORTATION Transportation systems and techno logies have some of the greate st impacts on the health of communities, local air quality, and global climate change. The County supports policie s and legislation that: Increase funding for public transit.

PAGE | 142 Alameda County Federal Legislative Priorities 2018 PUBLIC TRANSIT Use of public transit instead of singleoccupant vehicles reduc es greenhouse gas emissions, reduces the number of vehicle miles driven, and encourages walking and biking, which helps to make an impact on health outcomes, including the obesity epidemic. Access to affordable and rel iable public transit is particularly vital to access economic opportunities, to get to jobs and schools, and to prom ote health for all communities, especially youth, seniors, and people with disabilities. People will more likely avoid car trips and have more access to job opportunities when homes, jobs, and services are placed close a ccessible and affordable public transit options. This, in turn, provides a reliable customer base for public tra nsit systems. The County supports policie s and legislation that: Sustain and prioritize increased funding for public transit. Support the reauthorizat ion and expansion of transportation funds to increase the accessibility, reliability , and affordability of public transit options, particularly local buses, as wel l as improve connectivity to re gional rail systems. Support flexible funding for public transit so that they can be used for mobility management and other needs. Support increased funding for needed infrastructure upgrades. Prioritize funding for lowincome and transitdependent populat ions.

Support increasing greenhouse ga s reduction goals and support p olicies and funding that benefit health and well being for communities facing environmental hazards, healt h burdens, high levels of neighborhood poverty and other vulnerabilities. Support policies that addres s pollution and safety impacts and other barriers to transit users, pedestrians and bicyclists, particul arly healthburdened and lowincome communities. Support prioritizing transportation policies and projects that have greater community benefits, such as living wage jobs and zero emissions transportation, than burdens for v ulnerable communities and which minimize unintended consequences, such as displacement. Improve partnerships. Support policies and funding to improve regional collaboration and cooperation on transit improvements and consolidation of systems and programs. Support policies for the development of local and highspeed rail networks to provide additional travel alternatives. GOODS MOVEMENT Alameda County is a gateway to the world for goods movement. It s airport, Oakland International, is one of three in the region. The Port of Oakla nd, the nation's 5th busiest co ntainer port, is one of three Pacific Coast gateways with maritime, rail and aviation freight activities. The Port o f Oakland is a key economic asset for Alameda County, the greater San Francisco Bay Region and neighboring regions. I t supports more than 73,000 jobs in the region and its activities are connected t o 827,000 jobs across the United States. As an intermodal operation, port activities impact regional and interregional streets, rural roads and hig hway, rail corridors and waterways. PAGE | 143 Alameda County Federal Legislative Priorities 2018 Planning and implementation is underway for future expansion of the Port of Oakland to support its activities and for improvements to the transpor tation network system. The Ala meda County Transportation Commission (ACTC) is developing the first Countywide Goods Movement Plan. The Pla n also outlines a longrange strategy for how to move goods efficiently, reliably and sustainably within, to, fr om and through Alameda County by roads, rail, air and water. Because a substantial amount of goods movement occurs on local streets and roads throughout Alameda County, the plan also addresses impacts to transportation infrastructur e. Challenges faced on the local streets and roads include lack of truck route connectivity across city boundaries , providing safe access by all local streets and road users (autos, pedestrians, bicyclists and public transit) and c ut through traffic on rural roads to avoid congestion on major corridors. Additionally, tr uck traffic on local streets a nd rural roads designed to accommodate vehicles is resulting in pavement damage and impacting the livability and q uality of life for the residents living adjacent to these goods movement corridors. The County supports policie s and legislation that: Expand goods movement funding and policy development. Develop policies that preserve and strengthen an integrated and connected multimodal goods movement system, support freight mobility and access, and are coordinated with passenger transportation systems and local land use decisions. Improve goods movement infrastructure. Support legislation, policies and funding to study, plan, fund and implement improvements for a safe, efficient, resilient and wel lmaintained goods movement facilities and corridors. Support legislation, policies and funding to study, plan and design safety improvements along local streets and rural roads to accommodate the increasing goods mov ement traffic, including driveway consolidation for truck access t o wineries, leftturn pockets a nd truck deceleration lanes.

Support legislation and policies that prioritize the Bay Area transportation systems in both State and f ederal planning and f unding processes. Mitigate goods movement impacts. Support policies and programs th at reduce and mitigate impacts from goods movement operations, such as noise and air quality, to cr eate a healthy and clean environment and support improved qualityoflife for people most impacted by go ods movement. REGIONAL AND INTERREGIONAL PARTNERSHIPS AND PROJECTS With over 20 percent of the population, Alameda County experien ces roughly 40 percent of the traffic congestion within the ninecount y San Francisco Bay Area region . Intersected by numerous interregional highway corridors which serve as gateways into the region, Alam eda County has a robust transportation infrastructure, including local streets and roads, freight corr idors, express lane impl ementation, and transit systems. Through regional coordi nation and funding partnerships at all levels of government, significant investment to improve transportation infrastructure has occurre d countywide in recent years. Alameda County supports and encourages continued crossjurisdictional partners hips to deliver transportation projects and programs to its constituents. Since 1986, Alameda County and it s 14 cities have been recipients of a county wide, voterapproved sales tax measure dedicated to transportat ion investments throughout Alameda County. The County supports policie s and legislation that: Expand partnerships. Support efforts that encourage and promote regional and megare gional cooperation and coordination to develop, promote, and fund solutions to tra nsportation infrastructure improvement and support governmental efficiencies and cost savings in transport ation. This is essential to complete planning and development of important reg ional transportation projects t hat benefit the State and local road system, including Vasco Road, Tesla Road, Greenville Road, and Patterson Pass Road in unincorporated Eastern PAGE | 144 Alameda County Federal Legislative Priorities 2018 Alameda County.
