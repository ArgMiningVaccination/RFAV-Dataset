Every year I spend weeks and months encouraging reluctant individuals to get the flu vaccine, usually with some success. Then, as soon as the virus hits town, I start to get calls from patients and physicians that they were just diagnosed with the flu, even though they got the vaccine.... Continue reading Posted Dec 17, 2013 at Hot Shots Comment 0 ImmTrac Modernization House Bill 772 is in the Senate Health and Human Services committee at the state legislature. This bill would improve ImmTrac, the state immunization registry, and save the state money by acknowledging the fact that well over 95 percent of the state's parents want to participate in this valuable safeguard...

It will be years more before we prove that cervical cancer rates decline,...

Click here to read the story. Continue reading Posted Jan 25, 2013 at Hot Shots Comment 0 Health Care Innovations Exchange Late last year, I blogged about our uncoordinated system of medical care in the US. The value of systematic health care can't be overstated in terms of reducing cost and increasing effectiveness. As just one example of this, within Kelsey-Seybold, our OB/Gyn doctors have access to immunization support services not... Continue reading Posted Jan 22, 2013 at Hot Shots Comment 0 Vaccine Reactions - What do they mean? Vaccine reactions cause a lot of unnecessary concern for most parents and patients. Most vaccine reactions occur at the site of the vaccination, whether injected, ingested or sprayed into the nose. These reactions - soreness in the muscle, redness or itchiness in the overlying skin, mild stomach upset or runny...

When the method of delivery changes, as with the new intradermal vaccine? When the amount given changes, as with the High-Dose vaccine for folks over 65? Or is it only new when the means...

Is it in your wallet, at home in a file, or have you misplaced it since then? Do you know if you have had two MMR vaccines? If you... Continue reading Posted Nov 15, 2012 at Hot Shots Comment 0 Immunization and the Healthcare Conglomeration When we talk about a healthcare system in the U.S., we really should be talking about a conglomeration, because the word \"system\" implies that there is some inherent organization involved. Instead, we have innumerable physician offices, clinics, pharmacies, hospitals, non-profit healthcare providers, mid-level providers, insurers, pharmaceutical companies and state, local... Continue reading Posted Nov 8, 2012 at Hot Shots Comment 0 Don't Be In Denial About West Nile Although this blog is supposed to be about immunizations, I can't help myself. I am very interested in prevention and in travel medicine as well, so the recent outbreaks of West Nile Virus have my attention. All of us in Houston need to learn \"Mosquito Precautions\" that are generally taught... Continue reading Posted Oct 3, 2012 at Hot Shots Comment 0 Flu Vaccine: It's Never Too Soon It's never too soon to prevent illness. Influenza vaccine is already available for this year, a full month ahead of usual arrival. This year's vaccine has two new virus strains, as scientists try to keep up with the changes the flu bug makes in its constant efforts to evade our...

Children who have been exposed to swine barns at agricultural fairs have been hardest hit, and there have been 224 cases reported as of August 17th. What hasn't...

I love the Olympics myself, along with all of the fanfare and record-breaking efforts and back stories of hardworking athletes and coaches. But this summer, there may...

Thirty years ago, the \"whole-cell\" DPT (diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus) vaccine in common use, and the only type available, included diphtheria and tetanus toxoid antigens, as it does today, but the pertussis or whooping cough component was made from the whole pertussis bacterium - killed, of course. The vaccine was... Continue reading Posted May 30, 2012 at Hot Shots Comment 0 Money vs. Lives; Protection vs. Too Many Injections Deciding which vaccines to include in the routine schedule for children and adults used to be easy. Vaccines were first developed against major killers or cripplers, such as smallpox, rabies, tetanus and diphtheria. The economics and priorities were clear - the diseases ravaged individuals and populations, and people died needless... Continue reading Posted May 21, 2012 at Hot Shots Comment 0 Pregnant? Get vaccinated. Recently, new recommendations have been issued for pregnant women to receive a dose of Tdap in pregnancy. This vaccine contains tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis antigens, proteins that help the immune system recognize and fight off these illnesses. Tetanus and diphtheria vaccine (Td) has been safely used for years during pregnancy...

It found that specific vaccines, vaccine components and vaccines in general do not cause autism. It determined that flu vaccine, if it does increase the number of cases of Guillain-Barre Syndrome, only does so by... Continue reading Posted Apr 26, 2012 at Hot Shots Comment 0 Hepatitis A - Are You at Risk? When I began practice in the 1980s, routine immunization for Hepatitis A was unavailable, and the standard of care to prevent it was to give gammaglobulin shots, a blood product, to travelers and to exposed individuals. Hepatitis A was common in my practice in Pasadena, with outbreaks related to daycare,... Continue reading Posted Apr 10, 2012 at Hot Shots Comment 0 Pre-sucked Suckers Make Me Sick Yuck. Hundreds of parents across the country apparently think that it is safer and better for their children to acquire full-strength disease-producing chickenpox virus from lollipops and cotton swabs contaminated with the spit of unknown infected children than to receive recommended vaccination with weakened virus that is free of contaminants... Continue reading Posted Mar 29, 2012 at Hot Shots Comment 0 Nothing Happens with Rotavirus Vaccine In many countries in South America and Africa, nothing is happening. Well, not really \"nothing.\" Actually, something very good is happening that is keeping lots of children from having something very, very bad happen to them. Children who would have died or been hospitalized from diarrheal illness and dehydration are...

This is an...

Furthermore, the Internet has provided a wide audience for rumors, as well as a source of both reliable and unreliable information. The question is - how do we know...

This year, you have more choices to be protected from the flu, including a new \"mini-shot\" that feels more like a mosquito bite than a shot. The new vaccine is called \"intradermal\" because it barely goes into the skin - instead of...
