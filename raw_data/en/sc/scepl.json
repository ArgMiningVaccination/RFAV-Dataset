These small chemicals are floating around your body opening and closing doors, and are capable of making drastic changes in your body. When these chemicals are not functioning properly, symptoms can start to occur either on a physical, emotional, or mental level. Finding a proper balance is important to your life. If your hormones are out of whack, you will not be able to proceed down the path of health graciously. This is why all my patients follow a protocol that includes diet modification, supplements, and certain therapies to help restore their hormone balance. If your hormone balance is upset, you will not feel at your best and you'll need the help of a naturopathic physician to restore your equilibrium. Common Hormone Balance Issues - - Fatigue (Adrenals) - [Adrenal fatigue](https://brodynd.com/conditions-treated/hormone-balance/fatigue-adrenals/) occurs because the adrenal gland releases its hormone at an elevated level for a prolongued period of time. The adrenal gland determines our reaction to stress, so instead of spiking and falling quickly a prolongued higher level will create burnout and fatigue once the levels finally fall back to normal. - - Female Hormones - [Female hormones](https://brodynd.com/conditions-treated/hormone-balance/female-hormones/) consist of cortisol, DHEA, estrogen, SHBG, progesterone and small amounts of testosterone and an imbalance of any could lead to different health issues. Infections, depression, anxiety, food cravings, weight gain, Premenstrual Syndrome and Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome are all possible results of hormone imbalance. - - Hypothyroid and Hyperthyroid - [Hypothyroidism](https://brodynd.com/conditions-treated/hormone-balance/hyperthyroid-and-hypothyroid-regulation/) is when the thyroid gland doesn't produce enough hormones, causing the body to slow down its biological functions. These results in fatigue, hair loss, memory loss, decreased libido, and weight gain. On the other hand, [hyperthyroidism](https://brodynd.com/conditions-treated/hormone-balance/hyperthyroid-and-hypothyroid-regulation/) is when the thyroid gland produces too many hormones, causing the body to move too quickly. These symptoms are fatigue, rapid heartbeat, increased hunger, sweating, nervousness, and weight loss. - - Male Hormones (Andropause) - [Male hormone deficiency](https://brodynd.com/conditions-treated/hormone-balance/male-hormones-andropause/), or andropause, can be caused by a number of factors, from aging to prostate issues. Symptoms can incluce depression, hair loss, fatigue, low muscle mass, increased fat mass, and a low sex drive. - - Type 2 Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome - [Type 2 Diabetes](https://brodynd.com/conditions-treated/hormone-balance/type-ii-diabetes-metabolic-syndrome/) can have terrible long-term consequences, which is why Dr. Brody works primarily in prevention when possible. Symptoms of pre-diabetes include weight gain, unhealthy eating habits, numbness in the extremities, high blood pressure, excessive thirst and more. This disease effects how your body handles and responds to sugar.
