From a research perspective, Traditional track faculty should drive new areas of basic, translational, clinical, or public health research and methods in their field. They should be evolving to be one of the foremost scholars in their specific area of research. These faculty are expected to demonstrate a consistent record of extramurally funded research, most often federally sponsored with at least one current federal award as principal investigator. [CS VERSUS TRADITIONAL TRACK VIDEO](https://medicine.yale.edu/media-player/cs-vs-traditional) Research is expected to drive a field in significant or innovative directions, including development of new principles, methods, or technology that influences the genesis or application of information in a field. This must be evidenced by peer reviewed original research articles as first or senior author. Collaborative original research is also valued. Chapters, reviews, and other publications can support but not substitute for original research. Teaching activities include didactic, research, and/or clinical settings to trainees. Faculty on this track should demonstrate exemplary clinical skills if engaged in patient care. Typically, faculty on this track have 75-80% of their effort directed toward research activities. Complementing this, 20-25% of their effort is typically allocated to educational, clinical, or administrative activities. This track is a path toward tenure at the ranks of associate professor or professor. This is a permanent, forward-looking commitment. This commitment is made with consideration of the achievements of the individual and the programmatic needs of the department and the school. Appraisals of past contributions must be supplemented by strong evidence of future contributions to the profession and the teaching program. Individuals who contribute to graduate education and who hold a primary appointment in a basic science department are automatically appointed to the Graduate School. Those who will contribute to graduate education and hold a primary or secondary appointment in a bridge department are eligible for appointment to the Graduate School, as are those with a secondary appointment in a basic science department. - Assistant Professor - Associate Professor with Term - Associate Professor with Tenure - Professor Assistant Professor with Term on the Traditional Track Description: Candidates for appointment of assistant professor with term on the Traditional track will have published high quality scholarship and have significant promise as a teacher and scholar.
