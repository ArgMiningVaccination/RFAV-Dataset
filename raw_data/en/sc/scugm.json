Preparation - Bacter ial vaccines, simple or polyvalent, are prepared from selected cultures after careful examination for their identit y, specificit y, purity and antigencit y. They may be prepared in the following manner: .- (a) Formal Cultures or Bacterins.- The selected pure culture strain or strain are grown in a suitable fluid medium, at an optimum temperature, for an appropriate period. The pure growth is then exposed to the action of solution of Formaldehyde I.P. in suitable concentration and temperature. The product is finally filled in suitable sterilised containers which are subsequently sealed. (b) Vaccine of Bacterial Products or Bacterial Derivatives .-These vaccin es are prepared by growing the organisms on suitable media and then deriving specif ic antigenic constituents of the bacteria by various special methods. (c) Living Bacterial Vaccines .- They are prepared from non-pathogenic but fully immunogenic strains of micro-organis m. Strict aseptic precautions are taken throu ghout the preparation against the introduction of microbial s. 7. General Standa rds:. Bacterial vaccines are colourle ss to yellowish brown liquids containing dead or viable bacteria in homogenous suspension. (b) Identifica tion.-All types of vaccines confer active immunity in the susceptib le animals which can be demonstrated by injecting suitable experim ental animals with the calculated doses of the product and subsequently deter mining the prese nce of the protective antibodies in their serum and/or by challenging the vaccinated animals by injecting virulent strain of the homologous organi sms. The protected animals should survive the challenge. (c) Test for Sterility. -All bacterial vaccines shall be tested for sterility in accordance with the provision of Rules 115 to 119 (both inclusive). If the vaccine contains added bactericide or bacteriostati c, a quantity of medium sufficient to render the growth inhibitor ineffective is added to the sample, or a suitable substance is added to the sample, or a suitable substance is added in concentration sufficient to render the growth inhibitor ineffective but not itself to inhibit the growth of micro -organis m. (d) Purity Tests for Living Bacterial Vaccine .-Petri dishes containing suitable media are streaked with the final product and incubated at 37 C for 72 hours. The vaccine passes the test if no growth of micro -organi sms other than those from which the vaccine was prepared is observed. Other tests include examination for motility of the organisms, fermentation reactions and thermoagglutinatio n test and dye-inhibitor tests in case of bruceliza vaccine.

(c) Sterility test - It shall comp ly with the tests for steril ity as prescribed under the general monograph on Viral Vaccines. (d) Safety test - The test is carried out on fully susceptible cattle not less than 12 months of age and which have not been sensitized either by vaccination or previous infection. Inoculate 3 susceptible cattles each with 2 ml. of finished product at multiple sites on tongue by intradermal route and observe for 4 days. The same animals are inoculated on 4th day with 3 cattle doses subcutaneously and are observed for a further period of 6 days. The animals should not develop any signs of FMD and remain normal . (e) Potency test - Each batch of the vaccine is to be tested in susceptible cattle of not less than 15 months of age. The potency test in cattle can be done either by :- (i) PD 50 Method : The vaccine shall be tested by the determination of PD50 in susceptible cattle by chall enging animals vaccinated with appropriate dilution of the vaccine made in adjuvant ed or non-adjuvanted diluent as appropriate. A minimum of 5 anima ls should be used per dilution and 2 unvaccinated animals to be included as controls to the challen ge. All animals are needle challenged with 10,000 ID50 of the homolog ous strain of virus by inoculation on the tongue on the 21st day of post-vaccinat ion. The control animals are to be similarly challenged. Animals are observed for 10 days for the development of lesions. Unpro tected animals show generalised lesions due to FMD. Control animals must shown generalized lesions. From the number of animals protected in each group the PD50 content of the vaccine is calculated. The vaccine passes the test if an observed PD 50 value of 3 or greater is obtained in the test. (ii) Percentage protection method in which groups of ten health susceptible cattle are each injected subcutaneous ly with the vaccinating dose and 14 - 21 days later the cattle are challe nged by intrade rmal injection into three separa te sites on the tongue with 10,000 ID50 of the strain of virus used in the preparation of the vaccine. The vaccine can be passed if atleast seven out of the ten in the group are protected against the develop ment of generalized infection where as all the controls should react by developing primary and secondary lesions obser vable in the mouth and feet. For other reasons if cattle testing is not possible then the poten cy of the vaccine may be assed in guineapigs either by Lucam C' index or PD50 method by challeng ing those which have been previous ly vaccinated, prov ided that the correlation has been established betwe en guinea pig challenge test and cattle challenge results. The estimation of the serum neutral izing antibody titre cattle may be considered as a supportive test to evaluate poten cy of vaccine. However, potency testing of vaccines, in cattle, of batches whenever by other accepted methods of testing is in doubt, at aleast one out of every five batches, be undertaken. 5 Labelling :- It is labelled as described under the require ments of labelling' as laid down in the general monograph, with the additional requirements that the label on the container states the virus types used in the preparatio n. 6.

Preparation - Smooth strain of Brucella abort us strain 99 is grown in potato infusion agar for 48 to 72 hours in Roux flasks, at 37 C. Condensation fluid if any is pipetted off before washing. Each flask is washed with about 20 ml. of normal saline. The pooled washing is filtered through a gauze and the filtrate is collected in a measuring cylinder. To every 500 ml. of the filtrate 1 g. of 2, 3, 5, triphen yl tetrazoli um chloride is added immediately. The container is shaken for thirty minutes till the tetrazoli um salt is dissolved. The product is taken out and kept at 37 C for two hours. After incubati on the product is heated at 65 C in a water bath for thirty minutes. It is cooled and centrifuged at 3000 r.p.m for one hour.

This forms concentrated antigens. Standardizat ion of the Strained Antigen An aliquot portion of the microbial suspension stained with phenylte-trazol ium is taken, representing the initial undiluted suspension. 1 ml. per tube of this initial undiluted stained suspension is added to six test tubes, followed by increasing quantities of the glycerolphenol diluent as follows: - Tube Undiluted Stained Suspens ion Diluent 1 1 0.6 2 1 0.8 3 1 1.0 4 1 1.2 5 1 1.4 6 1 1.6 The contents of each tube are then diluted tenfold with the same diluent and serve as antigen for a tube agglut ination test with the Standa rd Serum (or its national counterp art). In this way, six sero-reactions will be carried out. During this procedure, the concentrated strained microbial suspension should be kept in the refrigerator at 4 C. The agglutination reactions are read after forty-eight hours at the agglutination titre of the Standard Serum, previous ly deter mined with the usual unstained antigen in the tube test, correspondi ng to the correct dilution of the standard antigen. The next step, therefore, is to dilute the concentrated stained suspension to the same extent as the tube whose tenfold dilution has given the correct agglutination titre, i.e. the concentration of antigen in the tube before the tenfold diluti on had been made. 4.

METHODS OF TEST The sample is unfolde d, opened and held against diffused daylight or spread on black topped table to locate and identi fy prominent ly visible defects in yarn and fabric construction. The fabric shall be reason ably free from holes, slubs, snarls and na ps as well as the following: - Odour. - Misty odour, or any objection able smell like that of chemica ls or materials used in sizing and bleaching. Skewness. - (For Bandage Cloth only) A condition where warp and weft do not keep at right angles to each other. Defect ive Selvedge. - The selvedge tearing and allowing yarn to unravel and loop formation at selvedge. Cracks. - Prominent steaks of space or gaps between warp or weft yarns. Double ends.- More warp threads woven as one, due to wrong draw. Sloughing.- Entanglement in the fabric of a bulk of yarn that has slipped off the weft yarn due to loose widing. Measurement of length and width. Length is the distance from end to end, along one edge of the fabric, and width is the perpendicular distance from one edge to the opposite edge. Lengt h. - Fix a meter scale to a table or mark off the division of one metre on a table edge. Starting from one end, spread the fabric flat on that table in a single layer keeping one Drugs and C osmetics Rules 1945 394 selvedge parallel to the scale; smoothen the fabric without stretching it, to avoid creases, and mark off with a coloured pen cil, on the selvedge exactly one metre. Shift the fabric and measure the same way the second metre and so on for the entire length of the fabric making a mark at each metre. Note down the total length in metres. Repeat this at the opposite selvedge, as well as on the fabric folded approxi mately about the middle. The average of the three readings is the leng th. For cut bandages, one measurement at the middle of the bandages by fo lding it length -wise will suffice. Widt h. - Lay the portion of the fabric to be measured flat and smooth on the tables, but do not stretch fabric except sufficient ly to render it creaseless. At the place where mark had been made on the selvedge in measuring the length measure the perpendi cular distance to the opposite selvedg e with a metre scale. Note the width, repeat this at every mark made in measuring the length. The average of all the readings is the width of the fabric. For cut bandages, width shall be measured at every 50 cms., and average reported as width. Threads per dm.- (For examples not less than 15 m. in length). Weft. - At the third metre from one extreme locate three places one at about 5 cm. below the top selvedge, a second in the middle and third at about 5 cm. below the top selvedge, a second in the middle and third about 5 cm. above the bottom selvedge, all three in a vertical row. Take a rectangular plate (made of suitable material such as plastic or aluminium) with the rectangular open ing of 5 cm. x 10 cm. cut in it. Keep the plate on the fabric horizont ally so that the left 5 cm. side and bottom (10 cm. side) edges of the opening coincides with a weft and warp yarns respectively; count the number of weft yarns within t he opening for the length of 10 cm.. Repeat t his at the other two selected places, and note down the average of three reading s. Repeat this at every third metre in the sample and calculate the average weft per dm. Warp.- Keep the rectangular plate, this time vertically with left (10 cm. side) and bottom (5 cm. side) edge of opening coinciding with a weft and warp yarn respectivel y. Count the number of warp yarns within the opening for 10 cm. and note down. Repeat this for about 10 selected places in the samples taking care that the same set of warp yarns is not counted more than twice and calculate the average warp per dm. Magnif ying glass mounted on stand may be used for count ing. For samples less than 15 m. in length, locate as many different pla ces as the dimension of the fabric permits, the total being not less than 10 for each sample and calculate the warp and weft per dm. as above. For cut ba ndages, all the warp threads in the sa mples are counted, taking care to leave 5 mm at the cut edge, and weft is coun ted at every 50 cm. at any place about the middle of the bandage. Weight per unit area. For samples not less than 15 m. in length, cut out pieces of fabric fr om the entire length of sample, repres entative places being taken from areas at every third or fourth metre so that the total area of all the pieces so collected is not less than 3 sq. metre. Weigh the pieces accurately, measure the dimension of each of the pieces and calculate the area and weight of all the pieces. From the average area and average of weight thus obtained, calculate the area per sq. metre. For samples less than 15 m. length, take pieces in such a manner that the total area of the selected pieces is not less than 20 per cent of the total area of the sample. For cut bandages, pieces of 50 cm. in length, cut from 5 differ ent cut bandages in a packing should be taken and weight calculated as an average of 5 readings. Absorbency. - Take a glass trough of approximate size length 30 cm. x width 30 cm. x depth 25 cm. with straight thick walls and flat bottom. Fill it almost full with distilled water leavi ng only about 5 cm. from the top rim of trough. Maintain the water at 27o C \u00b1 1o C. Drugs and C osmetics Rules 1945 395 Cut out from any five places located equidistant down the length of the entire sample, square piece s, each weighting one g m. (\u00b110 per cent). Fold each piece in such a manner that a square of approxi mately 5 cm. x 5 cm. is obtained. Keep one of the folded test speci men between two glass plates and place 1 kg weight on the top for 10 minutes. Remove the weight. Lift the specimen with forceps and gently place it on to the surface of water (the specimen should be lightly pinched in the middle with a blunt forceps having no serrations). As soon as the specimen touches the water surface start a stopwatch which is stopped when the entire sample disappears below the surface of the water. Record the time taken. Repeat the test with the other four-test speci mens. Calculate the average time in seconds. Foreign Matter Dry about 5 g. of the sample to constant weight at 105o C and weigh the dried sample accuratel y. Extract the dried sample with chloroform for one hour in an apparatus for the continu ous extraction of drugs. Remove the extra cted sample to a beaker and allow the evaporation of residual chlorofor m. Wash the material 12 times with hot water, using about 1000 ml. for each wash ing and wring ing the material by hand after each washing; pass all water through a fine sieve (100 mesh). Place the washed material and any loose threads or fibres from sieve in a beaker, cover with a 0.5 per cent aqueous solution of diastase and maintain at 50oC until free from starch. Allow to cool, filter the solution through a sieve; return sample and loose fibre to a beaker. Repeat the washing process as before with hot water. Dry the material to constant weight at 105oC, and determine the loss in weight. Calculate the percentage of foreign matter, which is equal to the loss in weight, with reference to the sample dried to constant weight, at 10 5o C. If the sample is tested with iodine and is known to be free from starch, the treatment with solution of diastase and the second series of washing with hot water may be omitted.

The rest portion should be withdrawn from the middle of the sample. (2) Method of resting stability after dilution. - (a) Preparation of Artificial Hard Water: 40 ml of I N Hydrochloric Acid (Anal ytical Reagent Qualit y) is neutralized with a slight excess of Calci um Carbonate and filtered. The filtrate is diluted to 1000 ml with distilled water, 10 parts of this solut ion is further diluted to 100 parts with distilled water. (b) Preparation of Artificial Sea Water: 27G of Sodium Chloride (Anal Reagent Quality) are disso lved in distill ed water and diluted to 1000 ml. The solution is filtered before use. (c) Procedure: Take 1 ml and 5 ml porti ons of the sample in duplicate in 100 ml stoppered measuring cylinder (IS: 878 - 1956) by means of pipettes. Dilute the sample with artificial Hard water or Artificial Sea water (as the case may be) upto 10 ml mark. Mix thoroughly by inverting the cylinder s 5 times. Keep the cylinders containing the diluted fluids for 6 hours at the extr emes of the temperature range specified for the particular type. The s ample complies with the test if the solution shows not more than a trace of separation at its top and bottom. (3) Method of determination of Rideal Walker Coefficient (R.W.C) - Apparatus - A loop, 4 mm in internal diameter is made at the end of 28 swg (0.376 mm) wire of platinum or platinum iridium allo y, 38 mm long from the loop to the holder. The loop is bent at such an angle to the length of the wire as will facilita te in removal vertically from the surface of the liquid while keeping the place of the loop horizon tal. Incubator - Set and maintained at 37o C \u00b1 1o C Pipettes - Standard gradua ted pipettes of capacity 10 ml; 5 ml and 1 ml Dropping Pipette - Made of delivery 0.2 ml Medication tubes - 5 sterile plugged rimless test tubes 125 mm x 22 mm (5 inch x \u00be inch) made of hard neutral glass. Both tubes - About 2 dozens of the same descript ion as medication tubes. Drugs and C osmetics Rules 1945 530 Standard measuring cylinders stopp ed and graduated \u2014500 ml graduated in 10 ml-;one 100 ml graduated 1 ml- five. All apparatus must be scrupulously clean and sterile; immediately before use. Reagents - (a) Broth.- Prepare a mixture of the following ingredi ents: Meat extract (Microbiological grade) 20 g Peptone (Micro biological grade) 20g. Sodium Chloride (Regent Qualit y) 10 g Distilled Water - 1000 ml. Dissolve the solids in distilled water. Add sufficient sodium hydroxide to neutralize the solution; then boil it to bring down phosphates and filter while hot. The broth thus prepared is then adjusted to pH 7.6 with normal Hydrochlor ic acid. The broth is then sterilized by autoclaving at 15 lbs pressure for 20 minutes. It is then filtered and placed in 5 ml quantities in sterilized broth tubes. The tubes of media thus prepared are sterilized by autoclaving at 15 lbs pressure for 10 minutes. The final pH of the medium should lie between 7.3 and 7.5. Further resterilization in bulk or in tubes is not permissible. (b) Test Organis m- Test organism used is Salmonella typhi (NCTC 786) of which suitable culture shall be obtained fr om the Director, Central Drugs Laborator y, Calcutta. This culture is maintained by weekly sub-culture on a nutrient agar slope (made by dissolving 2.5 per cent Agar Agar (Bacteriological grade) in broth prepared as above), incubating the sub- culture for 24 hours at 37O C and then storing in refrigerator at a temperature below 22o C. For th e purpose of the test a little of the growth from the most recent sub-culture in nutrient agar slope is placed in tube of R.W. broth and incubated for 23 hours at 38o C. A standard loopful is then transferred to a second tube and incub ated as before. This is done at least three times before a test is carried out. Sub-culturi ng in broth is limited to 14 days. (c) Standard phenol: 5 per cent W/V solution in sterile distilled water of chem ically pure phenol having a crystallizing point of not less than 40.5oC is prepared. Test dilutions are prepared from this stock solution conta ining 1 g of phenol in each 95, 100, 105, 115 ml of the solution made. These dilutions shall be used within a week of preparation. (d) Test dilutions of Disin fectant (sample)- The sample is prepared as described under Preparation of samples. A test portion of 5 ml is withdrawn and discharged into about 480 ml of sterile distilled water in a 500 ml glass stoppered sterile measuring cylinder and the pipette is rinsed three times or more in the clear liquid. The whole is then made up to 500 ml with sterile distilled water, the cylinder is stoppered and the contents thorough ly mixed by inverting the cylinder several times. Suitable test dilutions in sterile distilled water are then immediately prepared from this stock solution. Procedure: 5 ml of 4 chosen dilutions of the disinf ectant are placed in 4 medication tubes which are then placed in a rack provided with water bath maintained at a consta nt temperature between 17o C and 19o C, with the strongest dilution on the left. The fifth medication tube containing 5 ml of the particular phenol dilution is placed on the right. When the content on the medica tion tubes and broth culture of the test organism have reached the temperature of the water bath, starting at Zero time, 0.2 ml of the culture is added to the left hand medication tube and the tube is shaken gently. After 30 seconds the next tube is inoculated similarly and the process is repeated with each successive tube at intervals of 30 seconds until the phenol control has been inoculated. Thir ty seconds after this last addition (that is 2-1/2 minutes from zero) a loopful of the well-shaken content of the tube at the extr eme left is withdrawn and placed in tube containing 5 ml of the broth mediu m. Thirty seconds after this similar operation is performed on the second medicat ion tube. The procedure is repeated at an interval of 30 seconds with each of the 5 medication tubes working from left to right until 4 sets of cultures have been made i.e. at 2-1/2, 5, 7-1/2 and 10 minutes respectively after exposure. In each withdrawal care should Drugs and C osmetics Rules 1945 531 be taken to ensure that the loop is removed vertically from the surface of the liquid with its plane horizontal ly and without touching the side of the test tubes. The loop shall be sterilized by flaming between each operation, care being taken that the loop is cooled before being again used. The inoculated broth tubes are incubated for not less than 48 hours and not more than 72 hours at 37o C when the tubes showing growth of the test organis ms will be recognized by turbidi ty of the broth.

SUPPLEMENTARY GUIDELINES FOR MANUFACTURING OF RASAUSHADHIES OR RASAMARUNTHUKAL AND KUSHTAJAT (HERBO - MINERAL -METALLIC COMPOUNDS) OF AYURVEDA, SIDDHA AND UNANI MED ICINES These guidelines are intended to complement those provided above and should be read in conjunction with the parent guidelines. The supplementary guidelines are to provide general and minimum technical requirements for quality assurance and contro l in manufacturing Rasaushadhis or Rasamarunthukal and Kushtajat (Herbo and Kushta etc. used in Ayurvedic, Siddha and Unani Systems of medicine. The supplementary GMP guidelines for Rasaushadhi or Rasamarunthukal and Kushtajat are needed to establish the authenticity of raw drug, minera ls and metals, in - process validation and quality control parameters to ensure that these formulations are processed and prepared in accordance with classical texts and for which safety measures are complied. Only those manufacturing units which have Goo d Manufacturing Practices for ASU drugs and supplementary certificate for Rasaushadhi or Rasamarunthukal and Kushtajat formulations shall be allowed to manufacture th e same. Supplementary Good Manufactur ing Pr actices Certificate for Rasaushadhies shall be issued by the State Licensing Authority only after thorough inspection by an expert team including Rasashastra experts nominated by the Department of AYUSH. 2. Manufacturing Process Areas : - For the manufacture of Bhasma and Kupipakawa and Rasau shadhi preparations made from metals and minerals the following specific areas shall be provided, which should be completely segregated from the production area used for preparation of plants and animal by product based formulation to avoid cross contamin ation. The following exclusive areas the required for Rasaushadhies or Rasamarunthukal and Kushtajat: - 2.2 (a) Bhatti or Heating Device Section for Bhasma and Rasaushadhies : - 100 sq. feet for heating, burning, putta and any heat related work with pr oper ventilation, exhaust and chimney. This could be tin shed also. 1. Ins. By G.S.R. 157(E), dated 04 -03-2009 Drugs and C osmetics Rules 1945 567 (b) Grinding, Drying and Processing Section for Bhasma and Rasaushadhies: - 100 Sq. feet (Manual or Mechanical, oven etc.). Drying 1[Shal l be] done in a space which is covered by glass or other transparent material to allow entry of sunrays on the material to keep for the purpose. If drying is being done in oven the temperature of the same may be selected specific temperature. (c) Rashau shadi Related Store : -100 Sq. feet. The size and dimensions of each Bhatti Section would be so designed to suit the batch size or quantity of materials to be processed, keeping in mind the processing is done as per the conditions of Drug and Cosmetics Ac t mentioned under Schedule I official books. In addition to the fuels prescribed in the schedule books namely coal, fire wood, cow dung cakes etc., use of other heating devices e.g. electrical heating, oil or gas fired furnaces and others Shall be] employ ed so as to provide the required temperature as per the nature of material and object of heating. Depending on the formulation being manufactured, manufacturers may adopt aerobic or anaerobic process. Properly baked and clean earthen pots of other crucib les and glass containers of appropriate design shall be used. The manufacturing area should be designed with special attention to process the products that generate toxic fumes like SO2, arsenic and mercury vapor, etc. When heating and boiling of the mater ials is necessary, suitable ventilation and air exhaust flow mechanism should be provided to prevent accumulation of unintended fumes and vapors. Such areas may be provided with properly designed chimneys or ducts fitted with exhaust system and suitable s crubbing system to remove fumes and smoke, so that safety of personnel and environment is taken care of. Since processing of Rasaushadhis may introduce heavy metal contamination and cross contamination etc., therefore, cleaning of equipment is particul arly important after every process by using appropriate cleaning agent which should not react with material of equipment and must be free from unwanted properties e.g. corrosiveness. 2.3 Records shall be maintained specially for temperatures attained duri ng the entire process of Bhasmikaran, while employing different kinds of classical puta, furnaces using oil, gas or electricity. Appropriate temperature measuring instrument should be employed such as pyrometer and, pyrograph for manual reading or record ing by heat sensors, connected to computer as the case may be. In order to handle large quantities, appropriate technology like use of hand operated extruders for making chakrikas or pellets may be adopeted. However, such equipments made of aluminium or its alloys should not be used. 1. Subs. by G.S.R.Subs. by G.S.R.338(E), dated 15 -04-2010.

Ins. by G.S.R. 889 (E) dated 12 -12-2014. Drugs and C osmetics Rules 1945 589 (6) Human Pharmacology (Phase I) : (i) The objective of studies in this Phase is the estimation of safety and tolerability with the initial administra tion of an investigational new drug into human(s). Studies in this Phase of develop ment usually have non-therapeu tic objectives and may be conducted in healt hy volunteers subjects or certain types of patients. Drugs with significant potential toxici ty e.g. cytotoxic drug s are usually studied in patient s. Phase I trials should preferably be carried out by Investigators trained in clinical pharmacology with access to the necessary facilities to closely observe and monitor the Subjects. (ii) Studies conducted in Phase I, usually intended to involve one or a combination of the follow ing objectives: - (a) Maxim um tolerated dose: To determine the tolerabili ty of the dose range expected to be needed for later clinical studies and to determine the nature of adverse reactions that can be expected. These studies include both single and multiple dose administration. (b) Pharmacokinetics, i.e., charact erization of a drug's absorption, distributi on, metaboli sm and excretion. Although these studies continue throughout the develop ment plan, they should be performed to support formulation develo pment and deter mine pharmacok inetic parameters in different age groups to support dosing rec ommendations. (c) Pharmacodynamics: Depending on the drug and the endpoints studied, pharmacod ynamic studies and studies relating to drug blood levels (phar macokinetic/ pharmacod ynamic studies) may be conducted in healthy volunteer Subjects or in patients with the target disease. If there are appropriate validated indicators of activi ty and potential efficac y, pharmacodynamic data obtained from patients may guide the dosage and dose regimen to be applied in later studies. (d) Early Measure ment of Drug Activity: Preliminary studies of activity or potential therapeutic bene fit may be conduct ed in Phase I as a secondary objective. Such studies are general ly perfor med in later Phases but may be appropriate when drug activi ty is readily measurable with a short duration of drug exposure in patients at this early stage. (7) Therapeutic expl oratory trials (Phase II) : (i) The primary objective of Phase II trials is to evaluate the effectiveness of a drug for a particular indication or indications in patients with the condition under study and to dete rmine the common short -term side-effects and risks associated with the drug. Studies in Phase II should be conducted in a group of patients who are selected by relatively narrow criter ia leading to a relatively homogeneous population. These studies should be closely monitored. An important goal for this Phase is to determine the dose(s) and reg imen for Phase III trials. Doses used in Phase II are usually (but not alwa ys) less than the highest doses used in Phase I. (ii) Additional objectiv es of Phase II studies can include evaluation of potential study endpo ints, therapeutic regimens (including conco mitant medications) and target populat ions (e.g. mild versus severe disease) for further studies in Phase II or III. These objectives may be served by exploratory ana lyses, examining subsets of data and by including multiple endpo ints in trials. (iii) If the application is for conduct of clinical trials as a part of multi-national clinical develop ment of the drug, the number of sites and the patients as well as the justification for undertak ing such trials in India shall be provided to the Licensing Authori ty. Drugs and C osmetics Rules 1945 590 (8) Therap eutic confirmatory trials (Phase III): (i) Phase III studies have primary objective of demonstration or confir mation of therapeutic benefit(s). S tudies in Phase III are designed to confirm the preliminary evidence accumulated in Phase II that a drug is safe and effective for use in the intended indication and recipient population. These studies should be intended to provide an adequate basis for market ing approval. Studies in Phase III may also further explore the dose -response relationships (relationships among dose, drug concentration in blood and clinical response), use of the drug in wider populations, in different stages of disease, or the safety and efficacy of the drug in combination with other drug(s). (ii) For drugs intended to be administered for long periods, trials involv ing extended exposure to the drug are ordinari ly conducted in Phase III, although they may be initiat ed in Phase II. These studies carried out in Phase III complete the information needed to support adequate instructions for use of the drug (prescribing information). (iii) For new drugs approved outside India, Phase III studies need to be carried out primarily to generate evi dence of efficacy and safety of the drug in Indian patients when used as recommended in the prescribing infor mation. Prior to conduct of Phase III studies in Indian subjects, Licensing Authori ty may require pharmacokinetic studies to be undertaken to verify that the data generat ed in Indian populati on is in confor mity with the data already generated abroad. (iv) If the application is for the condu ct of clinical trials as a part of multi-national clinical develop ment of the drug, the number of sites and patients as well as the justification for undertaki ng such trials in India should be provided to the Licensing Authori ty along with the application. (9) Post Marketing Trials (Phase IV): Post Marketing trials are studies (other than routine surveillance) performed after drug appro val and related to the approv ed ind ication(s). These trials go beyond the prior demonstration of the drug's safet y, efficacy and dose definition. These trials may not be considered nece ssary at the time of new drug approval but may be requir ed by the Lic ensing Authori ty for optimizing the drug's use. They may be of any type but should have valid scientific objectives. Phase IV trials include additional drug-drug interaction(s), dose- response or safety studies and trials designed to suppo rt use under the approved indication(s), e.g. mortalit y/morbidi ty studies, epide miological studies etc. 3. Studies in special populations : Information support ing the use of the drug in children, pregna nt women, nursing women, elderly patients, patients with renal or other organ systems failure, and those on specific conco mitant medication is required to be submitted if relevant to the clinical profile of the drug and its anticipated usage pattern. Any claim sought to be made for the drug product that is not based on data submitted under preceding items of this Schedule should be supported by studies inclu ded under this item of the Schedule (Appendix I, item 8.3). (1) Geriatrics : Geriatric patients shou ld be included in Phase III clinical trials (and in Phase II trials, at the Spons or's option) in meaningful numbers, if- (a) the disease intended to be treated is charact eristically a disease of aging; or (b) the population to be treated is known to include substant ial numbers of geriatric patients; or Drugs and C osmetics Rules 1945 591 (c) when there is specific reason to expect that condit ions common in the elderly are likely to be encountered; or (d) when the new drug is likely to alter the geriatric patien t's response (with regard to safety or efficacy) compared with that of the non-geria tric patient. (2) Paediat rics: (i) The timing of paediatric studies in the new drug develop ment program will depend on the medicinal product, the type of disease being treated, safety considerations, and the efficacy and safety of available treatments. F or a drug expected to be used in children, evaluations should be made in the appropriate age group. When clinical develop ment is to include studies in children, it is usually appropriate to begin with older children before extending the trial to younger children and then infants. (ii) If the new drug is for diseas es predominantly or exclusively affecting paediatric patients, clinical trial data should be generated in the paediatric population except for initial safety and tolerability data, which will usual ly be obtained in adults unless such initial safety studies in adults would yield little useful infor mation or expose them to inappropriate risk. (iii) If the new drug is intended to treat serious or life-threatening diseases, occurring in both adults and paediatric patients, for which there are current ly no or limited therapeutic options, paediatric populat ion should be included in the clinical trials earl y, following assessment of initial safety data and reasonable evidence of potential benefit . In circumstances where this is not possible, lack of data should be justified in detail. (iv) If the new drug has a potential for use in paediatric patients - Paediatric studies shou ld be conducted. These studies may be initiated at various phases of clinical develop ment or after post marketing survelliance in adults if a safety concern exists. In cases where there is limited paed iatric data at the time of submission of application - more data in paediatric patients would be expected after marketing authorisation for use in children is granted. (v) The paediatric studies should include - (a) clinical trials, (b) relative bioequivalence c omparisons of the paediatric formulation with the adult for mulation perfor med in adults, and (c) definitive pharmacokinetic studies for dose selection across the age ranges of paediatric patients in whom the drug is likely to be used. These studies should be conducted in the paediatric patient popu lation with the disease under study. (vi) If the new drug is a major therapeutic advance for the paediatric population - the studies should begin early in the drug develop ment , and this data should be submitted with the new drug application. (vii) Paediatric Subjects are legally unable to provide written infor med consen t, and are dependent on their parent(s)/ legal guardian to assume responsibili ty for their participation in clinical studies. Written informed consent should be obtained from the parent/ legal guardian. However, all paediatric participa nts should be infor med to the fullest extent poss ible about the study in a language and in terms that they are able to understand. Where appropriate, paediatric participants should addition ally assent to enrol in the study. Mature minors and adolescents shou ld personally sign and date a separately designed written assent form. Although a participant's wish to withdraw from a study must be respected, there may be circumstances in therapeutic studies for serious or life-threatening diseas es in which, in the opinion of the Investigat or and parent(s)/ legal guardian, the welfare of a pediatric patient would Drugs and C osmetics Rules 1945 592 be jeopardized by his or her failing to participate in the study. In this situation, continued parental/ legal guardi an consent should be sufficient to allow participation in the stud y. (viii) For clinical trials conducted in the paediatric population, the reviewing ethics committee should include me mbers who are knowled geable about pediatric, ethical, clinical and psychosocial issues. (3) Pregnant or nursin g women : (i) Pregnant or nursing women should be included in clinical trials only when the drug is intended for use by pregnant/nursing w omen or foetuses/nursing infants and where the data generated from women who are not pregnant or nursing, is not suitable. (ii) For new drugs intended for use during pregnancy, follow-up data (pertaining to a period appropriate for that drug) on the pregnanc y, foetus and child will be required. Where applicable, excretion of the drug or its metab olites into human milk should be examined and the infant should be monitored for predicted pharmac ological effec ts of the drug. 1[(4) Post Marketing Surveillance : (i) The applicant shall have a pharmacovigilance system in place for collecting, processing and forwarding the report to the licensing authority for information on adverse drug reactions emerging from the use of the drug manufactured or marketed by the applicant in the country. (ia) The system shall be managed by qualified and trained personnel and the office r in- charge of collection and processing of data shall be a medical officer or a pharmacist trained in collection and analysis of adverse drug reaction reports. (ib) Subsequent to approval of the product, new drug shall be closely monitored for its clinic al safety once it is marketed. (ic) The applicant shall furnish Periodic Safety Update Reports (PSURs) in order to - (a) report all the relevant new information from appropriate sources; (b) relate these data to patient exposure ; (c) summarize the mar ket authorization status in different countries and any significant variations related to safety; and (d) indicate whether changes should be made to product information in order to optimize the use of the product. (ii) Ord inarily all dosage forms and formulations as well as indications for new drugs should be covered in one PSUR. Within the single PSUR separate presentati ons of data for different dosage forms, indications or separate population need to be given. (iii) All relevant clinical and non-clinical safety data should cover only the period of the report (interval data). The PSURs shall be submitted every six months for the first two years after approval of the drug is granted to the applicant. For subseq uent two years - the PSURs need to be submitted annually. Lic ensing autho rity may extend the total duration of sub mission of PSURs if it is considered necessary in the interest of public health. PSURs due for a period must be submitted within 30 calendar da ys of the last day of the reporting per iod. However, all cases involving serious unexpected adverse reacti ons must be reported to the licensing authority within 15 days of initial receipt of the information by the applicant. If marketing of the new drug is delayed by the applicant after obtaining approval to market, such data will have to be provided on the deferred basis beginning from the time the new drug is marketed. (iv) New studies specifically pla nned or conducted to examine a safety issue should be described in the PSURs. 1. Subs. by G.S.R. 287(E) dated 08 -03-2016. Drugs and C osmetics Rules 1945 593 (v) A PSUR should be structured as follows: (a) A title page stating: Periodic safety update report for the product, applicant's name, period covered by the report, date of approval of new drug, date of marketing of new drug and date of reporting; (b) Introductio n, (c) Current worldwide market authorization status, (d) Update of actions taken for safety reasons, (e) Changes to reference safety information, (f) Estimated patient exposure, (g) Presentation of individual case histori es, (h) Studies, (i) Other information, (j) Overall safety evaluation, (k) Conclusion, (l) Appendix providing material relating to indication s, dosing, pharmacology and other related infor mation.

APPEN DIX III ANIMAL TOXICOLOGY (NON-CLINICAL TOXICITY STUD IES) 1. General Principles: Toxicity studies should comply with the nor ms of Good Laboratory Practice (GLP). Briefly, these studies should be perfor med by suitably trained and qualified staff employing properly calibrated and standardized equip ment of adeq uate size and capacity. Studies should be done as per written protocols with modifications (if any) verifiable retrospe ctively. Standard operating procedures (SOPs) should be followed for all managerial and laboratory tasks related to these studies. Test substances and test syste ms (in-vitro or in-vivo) should be dized. All docu ments belongi ng to each study, including its approved protoc ol, raw data, draft report, final report, and histology slides and paraffin tissue blocks should be preserved for a minimum of 5 years after marketing of the drug. Toxicok inetic studies (generation of pharmacokinetic data either as an integral component of the cond uct of non-clinical toxici ty studies or in specially designed studies) should be conducted to assess the systemic exposure achieved in animals and its relationship to dose level and the time course of the toxicity study. Other objectives of toxicok inetic studies include obtaining data to relate the exposure achieved in toxicity studies to toxico logical findings and contribute to the assessment of the relevance of these findings to clinical safety, to support the choice of species and treatment regimen in nonclinical toxicity studies and to provide information which, in conjunction with the toxici ty findings, contribut es to the design of subsequent non-clinical toxici ty studi es. 1.1 Systemic Toxicity Studies 1.1.1 Single-dose Toxicity Studies: These studies (see Appendix I item 4.2) should be carried out in 2 rodent species (mice and rats) using the same route as intended for hu mans. In addition, unless the intended route of administration in humans is only intravenous , at least one more Drugs and C osmetics Rules 1945 603 route should be used in one of the species to ensure systemic absorption of the drug. This route should depend on the nature of the drug. A limit of 2g/kg (or 10 times the normal dose that is intended in humans, whichever is higher ) is recommended for oral dosing. Animals should be observed for 14 days after the drug administration, and minimum lethal dose (MLD) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) should be established. If possible, the target organ of toxicity should also be dete rmined. Mortality should be observed for up to 7 days after parenteral administration and up to 14 days after oral administration. Symptoms, signs and mode of death should be reported, with appropriate macroscopic and microscopic findings where necessary. LD10 and LD50 should be reported preferably with 95 percent confidence limits. If LD50s cannot be determined, reasons for the same should be stated. The dose causing severe toxic manifestations or death should be defined in the case of cytotoxic antica ncer agents, and the post -dosing observation period should be up to 14 days. Mice should first be used for determination of MTD. Findings should then be confirmed in rat for establishing linear relationship between toxicity and body surface area. In case of nonlinearity, data of the more sensitive species should be used to determine the Phase I starting dose. Where rodents are known to be poor predictors of human toxicity (e.g., antifolates), or where the cytotoxic drug acts by a novel mechanism of acti on, MTD should be established in non -rodent species. 1.1.2 Repeated -dose Systemic Toxicity Studies: These studies (see Appendix I, item 4.2) should be carried out in at least two mammalian species, of which one should be a non - rodent. Dose ranging studie s should precede the 14 -, 28-, 90- or 180 - day toxicity studies. Duration of the final systematic toxicity study will depend on the duration, therapeutic indication and scale of the proposed clinical trial (see item 1.8). If a species is known to metaboli ze the drug in the same way as humans, it should be preferred for toxicity studies. In repeated -dose toxicity studies the drug shou ld be administered 7 days a week by the route intend ed for clinical use. The number of animals required for these studies, i.e. the minimum number of animals on which data shou ld be available, is shown in Item 1.9. Wherever applicable, a control group of animals given the vehicle alone should be included, and three other groups should be given graded doses of the drug. The high est dose should produce observable toxicity; the lowest dose should not cause observable toxicity, but should be comparable to the intended therapeutic dose in humans or a multiple of it . To make allowance for the sensitivity of the species the intermedi ate dose should cause some symptoms, but not gross toxicity or death, and should be placed logarithmically between the other two doses. The parameters to be monitored and recorded in long -term toxicity studies should include behavioral, physiological, bioc hemical and microscopic observations. In case of parenteral drug administration, the sites of injection should be subjected to gross and microscopic examination. Initial and final electrocardiogram and fundus examination should be carried out in the non -rodent species. In the case of cytotoxic anticancer agents dosing and study design should be in accordance with the proposed clinical schedule in terms of days of exposure and number of cycles. Two rodent species may be tested for initiating Phase I trials . A non -rodent species should be added if the drug has a novel mechanism of action, or if permission for Phase II, III or marketing is being sought. Drugs and C osmetics Rules 1945 604 For most compounds, it is expected that single dose tissue distribution studies with sufficient sensitivi ty and specificity will provide an adequate assessment of tissue distribution and the potential for accumulation. Thus, repeated dose tissue distribution studies should not be required uniformly for all compounds and should only be conducted when appropriate data cannot be derived from other sources. Repeated dose studies may be appropriate under certain circumstances based on the data from single dose tissue distribution studies, toxicity and toxicokinetic studies. The studies may be most appropriate for compounds which have an apparently long half life, incomplete elimination or unanticipated organ toxicity. Notes: (i) Single Dose Toxicity Study : Each group should conta in at least 5 animals of either sex. At least four graded d oses should be given. Animals should be exposed to the test substance in a single bolus or by continu ous infusion or sever al doses within 24 hours. Ani mals should be observed for 14 days. Signs of intoxicati on, effect on body weigh t, gross pathol ogical changes should be reported. It is desirable to include histo -patholo gy of gross ly affected organs, if any. (ii) Dose -ranging Study: Objectives of this study include the identification of target organ of toxici ty and establishment of MTD for subsequent studies. (a) Rode nts: Study should be performed in one rodent species (preferably rat) by the proposed clinical route of administration. At least four gra ded doses including control shou ld be given, and each dose group as well as the vehicle control should co nsist of a minimum of 5 animals of each sex. Animals should be exposed to the test substance daily for 10 consecutive d ays. High est dose shou ld be the maximum tolerated dose of single -dose stu dy. Animals should be observed daily for signs of intoxicatio n (general appe arance, activity and behav iour etc), and periodically for the body weight and laborato ry parameters. Gross examination of viscera and microscopic examination of affected organs should be done. (b) Non-rodents : One male and one female are to be taken for ascending Phase MTD study. Dosing should start after initial recording of cage-side and laboratory par ameters. Starting dose may be 3 to 5 times the extrapolated effective dose or MTD (whichever is less), and dose escalation in suitable steps should be done every third day after drawing the samples for laborato ry parameters. Dose should be lowered appropriate ly when clinical or laborato ry evidence of toxicity are observed. A dministration of test substance should then continue for 10 days at the well-tolerated dose level following which, samples for laborat ory parameters should be taken. Sacrifice, autopsy and microscopic examination of affected tissues should be performed as in the case of rodents. (iii) 14 -28 Day repeated -dose t oxicity studies: One rodent (6 -10/sex/group) and one non - rodent (2 -3/sex/group) species are needed. Daily dosing by proposed clinical route at three dose levels should be done with highest dose having observable toxicity, mid - dose between high and low d ose, and low dose. The doses should preferably be multiples of the effective dose and free from toxicity. Observation parameters should include cage - side observations, body weight changes, food/water intake, blood biochemistry, haematology, and gross and microscopic studies of all viscera and tissues. (iv) 90-Day repeated -dose toxici ty rodent (15-30/sex/group) and no n- rodent (4-6/sex/group) species are needed. Daily dosing by proposed clinical route at three graded dose levels should be done. In addition to the control a high -dose-reversa l Drugs and C osmetics Rules 1945 605 group and its control group should be also included. Parameters should include signs of intoxication (general appearance, activity and beha viour etc), body weigh t, food intake, blood bioch emical parameters, haematological values, urine analysis, organ weights, gross and microscopic study of viscera and tissues. Half the animals in reversal groups (treated and control) should be sacrificed after 14 days of stopp ing the treatment. The remaining animals should be sacrificed after 28 days of stopping the treatment or after the recovery of signs and/or clinical patho logical changes - whichever comes later, and evaluated for the parameters used for the main study. (v) 1 80-Day repeated -dose toxici ty studies: One rodent (15-30/sex/group) and one non - rodent (4-6/sex/group) species are needed. At least 4 groups, including control, should be taken. Dai ly dosing by proposed clinical route at three graded dose levels should be done. Parameters should include signs of intoxicati on, body weight, food intake, blood bioche mistry, hematolo gy, urine analysis, organ weights, gross and microscopic examination of organs and tissues. 1.2 Male Fertility Study One rodent species (preferably rat) should be used. Dose selection should be done from the results of the previous 14 or 28 -day toxicity study in rat. Three dose groups, the highest one showing minimal toxicity in systemic studies, and a control group should be taken. Each group should consist of 6 adul t male animals. Animals should be treated with the test substance by the intended route of clinical use for minimum 28 days and maximum 70 days before they are paired with female animals of proven fertility in a ratio of 1:2 for mating. Drug treatment of the male animals should continue during pairing. Pairing should be continued till the detection of vaginal plug or 10 days, whichever is earlier. Females getting thus pregnant should be examined for their fertility index after day 13 of gesta tion. All the male animals should be sacrificed at the end of the study. Weights of each testis and epididymis should be separately recorded. Sperms from one epididymis should be examined for their motility and morphology. The other epididymis and both testes should be examined for their histology. 1.3 Female Reproduction and Developmental Toxicity Studies These studies (see Appendix I, item 4.4) need to be carried out for all drugs proposed to be studied or used in women of child bearing age. Segme nt I, II and III studies (see below) are to be perfor med in albino mice or rats, and segment II study should inclu de albino rabbits also as a second test species. On the occas ion, when the test article is not compatible with the rabbit (e.g. antibioti cs which are effective against gram positive, anaerobic organi sms and proto zoas) the Se gment II data in the mouse may be substituted. 1.3.1 Female Fertility Study (Segment I): The study should be done in one rodent species (rat preferred). The drug should be administered to both males and females, beginni ng a sufficient number of days (28 days in males and 14 days in females) before mating. Drug treatment should continue during mating and, subsequent ly, during the gestation period. Three graded doses shoul d be used, the highest dose (usually the MTD obtained fr om previous s ystemic toxicity studies) should not affect general health of the parent animals. At least 15 males and 15 females should be used per dose grou p. Control and the treated groups should be of similar size. The route of administration should be the same as intended for therapeutic use Drugs and C osmetics Rules 1945 606 Dams should be allowed to litter and their medication should be continued till the weaning of pups. Observations on body weight, food intake, clinical signs of intoxication, mating behaviour, progress of gestation/ parturit ion periods, length of gestation, parturition, post-partum health and gross pathol ogy (and histopa tholo gy of affected organs) of dams should be recorded. The pups from both treated and control groups shou ld be observed for general signs of intoxication, sex -wise distribution in different treatment groups, body weight, growth parameters, survival, gross examination, and autop sy. Histopathol ogy of affected organs shou ld be done. 1.3.2 Teratogenicity Study (Segment II): One rodent (preferably rat) and one non-rodent (rabbit) species are to be used. The drug shou ld be administered throug hout the period of organoge nesis, using three dose levels as described for segment I. The highest dose should cause minimum maternal toxici ty and the lowest one should be proporti onal to the proposed dose for clinical use in hu mans or a multiple of it. The route of administration should be the same as intended for human therapeutic use. The contr ol and the treated groups should consist of at least 20 pregnant rats (or mice) and 12 rabbits, on each dose level. All foetuses should be subjected to gross exa mination, one of the foetuses should be examined for skeletal abnor malities and the other half for visceral abnormalities. Observation para meters should include: (Dams) signs of intoxication, effect on body weight, effect on food intake, examination of uterus, ovaries and uterine contents, number of corpora lutea, implantation s ites, resorptions (if any); and for the foetuses, the total number, gender, body length, weight and gross/ visceral/ skeletal abnorma lities, if any. 1.3.3 Perinatal Study (Segment III): This study is specially recommended if the drug is to be given to pr egnant or nursing mothers for long periods or where there are indications of possible adverse effects on foetal development. One rodent species (preferably rat) is needed. Dosing at levels comparable to multiples of human dose should be done by the int ended clinical route. At least 4 groups (including control), each consisting of 15 dams should be used. The drug should be administered throughout the last trimester of pregnancy (from day 15 of gestation) and then the dose that causes low foetal lo ss should be continued throughout lactation and weaning. Dams should then be sacrificed and examined as described below. One male and one female from each litter of F1 generation (total 15 males and 15 females in each group) should be selected at wean ing and treated with vehicle or test substance (at the dose levels described above) throughout their periods of growth to sexual maturity, pairing, gestation, partu rition and lactation. Mating performance and fertility of F1 generation should thus be evaluated to obtain the F2 generation whose growth parameters shou ld be monitored till weaning. The criteria of evaluation should be the same as described earlier (3.4.1). Animals should be sacrificed at the end of the study and the observation para meters should include (Dams) body weight, food intak e, general signs of intoxication, progress of gestation/ parturition periods and gross patholo gy (if any); and for pups, the clinical signs, Drugs and C osmetics Rules 1945 607 sex-wise distribution in dose groups, body weight, growth parameters, gross examination, survival and autop sy (if needed) and where necessary, histopatholog y. 1.4 Local toxicity These studies (see Appendix I, item 4.5) are required when the new drug is proposed to be used by some special route (other than oral) in humans. The drug shou ld be applied to an approp riate site (e.g., skin or vagin al mucous membrane) to determine local effects in a suitable species. Typical study designs for these studies should include three dose levels and untreated and/ or vehicle control, preferably use of 2 species, and increasing group size with increase in duration of treatment. Where dosing is restricted due to anat omical or humane reasons, or the drug concentr ation cannot be increased beyond a certain level due to the problem s of solubili ty, pH or tonici ty, a clear statement to this effect should be given. If the drug is absorbed from the site of application, a ppropriate s ystemic toxicity studies will also be required. Notes : (i) Dermal toxicity study: The study should be done in rabbit and rat. Daily topical (dermal) application of test substance in its clinical dosage form should be done. Test mater ial should be applied on shaved skin covering not less than 10% of the total body surface area. Porous gauze dressing should be used to hold liquid material in place. Formulations with different concentrations (at least 3) of test substance, several fold higher than the clinical dosage form should be used. Period of application may vary from 7 to 90 days depending on the clinical duration of use. Where skin irritation is grossly visible in the initial studies, a recovery group should be included in the subsequent repeated -dose study. Lo cal signs (erythema, oedema and eschar formation) as well as histological examination of sites of applic ation should be used for evaluation of results. (ii) Photo -allergy or dermal photo -toxicity: It should be tested by Armstrong/ Harber Test in guinea pig. This test should be done if the drug or a metabolite is related to an agent causing photosensitivity or the nature of action suggests such a potential (e.g., drugs to be used in treatment of leucoderma). Pretest in 8 animals should screen 4 concentrations (patch application for 2 hours \u00b115 min.) with and without UV e xposure (10 J/cm2). Observations recorded at 24 and 48 hours should be used to ascertain highest nonirritant dose. Main test should be performed with 10 test animals and 5 controls. Induction with the dose selected from pretest should use 0.3 ml/patch for 2 hour \u00b115 min. followed by 10 J/cm2 of UV exposure. This should be repeated on day 0, 2,4,7,9 and 11 of the test. Animals should be challenged with the same concentration of test substance between day 20 to 24 of the test with a similar 2 -hour appl ication followed by exposure to 10 J/cm2 of UV light. Examination and grading of erythema and oedema formation at the challenge sites should be done 24 and 48 hours after the challenge. A positive control like musk ambrett or psoralin should be used. (iii) Vaginal Toxic ity Test: Study is to be done in rabbit or dog. Test substance should be applied topically (vaginal mucosa) in the form of pessar y, cream or ointment. Six to ten animals per dose group should be taken. Higher concentrations or several daily applications of test substance should be done to achieve multiples of daily human dose. The minimum duration of drug treatment is 7 days (more according to clinical use), subject to a maxi mum of 30 days. Observ ation para meters should include swell ing, closure of introitus and histopatho logy of vaginal wall. Drugs and C osmetics Rules 1945 608 (iv) Rectal Tolerance Test: For all prepara tions meant for rectal administration this test may be performed in rabbits or dogs. Six to ten animals per dose group should be taken. Formulati on in volume comparable to human dose (or the maximum possible volu me) should be applied once or several times daily, per rectall y, to achieve a dministration of multiples of daily human dose. The minimum duration of application is 7 days (more according to clinical use), subject to a maximum of 30 days. Size of suppositories may be smaller, but the drug conte nt should be several fold higher than the proposed human dose. Observation para meters should include clinical signs (sliding on backside), signs of pain, blood and/or mucus in faeces, condition of anal region/sphincter, gross and (if required) histological examination of rectal mucosa. (v) Parenteral Drugs: For products for intravenous or intramuscular or subcutaneous or intrade rmal inject ion the sites of injection in systemic toxicity studies should be specially examined gross ly and microsc opicall y. If needed, reversibili ty of adverse effects may be determined on a case to case basis. (vi) Ocular toxicity studies (for products meant for ocular instillation): These studies should be carried out in two species, one of which should be the albino rabbit which has a sufficiently large conjunctival sac. D irect delivery of drug onto the cornea in case of animals having small conjunctival sacs should be en sured. Liquids, ointments, gels or soft contact lenses (saturated with drug) should be used. Initial single dose appli cation should be done to decide the exposure concentrations for repeated -dose studies and the need to include a recove ry group. Duration of the final study will depend on the propo sed length of human exposure subject to a maximum of 90 days. At least two different concentrations exceeding the human dose should be used for demonstrating the margin of safet y. In acute studies, one eye should be used for drug ad ministration and the other kept as control. A separate control group should be included in repeated -dose studi es. Slit-lamp examination should be done to detect the changes in cornea, iris and aqueous humor. Fluorescent d yes (sodium fluorescein, 0.25 to 1.0%) should be used for detecting the defects in surface epithelium of cornea and conjunctiva. Changes in intra-ocular tension shou ld be monitored by a tonometer. Histological exa mination of eyes should be done at the end of the study after fixation in Davidso n's or Zenker's fluid. (vii) Inhalation toxicity studies: The studies are to be undertaken in one rodent and one non-rodent species using the formulation that is to be eventual ly proposed to be marke ted. Acute, subacute and chronic toxici ty studies should be performed according to the intended durati on of hu man exposure. Standard systemic toxici ty study designs (described above) should be used. Gases and vapours should be given in whole body exposure chambers; aerosols are to be given by nose-only method. Exposure time and concentrations of test substance (li mit dose of 5mg/l) should be adjusted to ensure exposure at levels comparable to multiples of intended human exposure. Three dose groups and a control (plus vehicle control, if needed) are required. Duration of exposure may vary subject to a maxi mum of 6 hours per day and five days a week. Food and water should be withdrawn during the period of exposure to test substance. Temperature, h umidity and flow rate of exposure chamber should be recorded and reported. Evidence of exposure with test substance of particle size of 4 micron (especially for aerosols) with not less that 25% being 1 micron should be provided. Effects on respiratory rate, findings of bronchial lavage fluid examination, histological examination of Drugs and C osmetics Rules 1945 609 respiratory passages and lung tissue should be included along with the regular par ameters of systemic toxicity studies or assessment of margin of safet y. 1.5 Allergenicity/ Hypersensitivit y: Standard tests include guinea pig maximization test (GPMT) and local lymph node assay (LLNA) in mouse. Any one of the two may be done. Notes: (i) Guinea Pig Maximization Test: The test is to be performed in two steps; first, determination of maximum nonirritant and minimum irritant doses, and second, the main test. The initial study will also have two components. To determine the intradermal inducti on dose, 4 dose levels should be tested by the sa me route in a batch of 4 male and 4 female animals (2 of each sex should be given Freund 's adjuvant). The minimum irritant dose shou ld be used for inductio n. Similarl y, a topical minimum irritant dose should be deter mined for challenge. This should be established in 2 males and 2 females. A minimum of 6 male and 6 female animals per group should be used in the main study. One test and one control group should be used. It is preferable to have one more positive control group. Intradermal induction (day 1) coupled with topical challenge (day 21) should be done. If there is no response, re-challenge should be done 7-30 days after the primary challenge. Erythema and oede ma (individual animal scores as well as maxi mization grading) should be used as evaluation criteria. (ii) Local Lymph Node Assa y: Mice used in this test should be of the same sex, either on ly males or only females. Drug treatment is to be given on ear skin. Three graded doses, the highest being maximum nonirritant dose plus vehicle control shou ld be used. A minimum of 6 mice per group should be used. Test material should be applied on ear skin on three consecutive da ys and on day 5, the drain ing auricular lymph nodes should be dissected out 5 hours H-thymidine or bromo - thymidine or BrdU incorporation should be used as the criterion for evaluation of results. 1.6 Geno toxicity Genotoxic compounds, in the absence of other data, shall be presumed to be trans - species carcinogens, i mplying a hazard to humans. Such compounds need not be subjected to long-term carcinogenici ty studies. However, if such a drug is intended to be administered for chronic illnesses or otherwise over a long period of time - a chronic toxicity study (up to one year) may be neces sary to detect early tumorigenic effects. Genotoxicity tests are in vitro and in vivo tests cond ucted to detect compounds which induce genetic damage directly or indirectl y. These tests should enable a hazard identification with respect to damage to DNA and its fixation. The following standard test battery is generally expected to be conducted: (i) A test for gene mutation in bacteria. (ii) An in vitro test with cytogenetic evaluation of chromosomal damage with m ammal ian cells or an in vitro mouse lymphoma tic assay. (iii) An in vivo test for chromosomal damage using rodent haematopoietic cells. Other geno toxici ty tests e.g. tests for measurement of DNA adducts, DNA strand breaks, DNA repair or recombination serve as options in addit ion to the standard battery for further investigation of genotoxici ty test results obtained in the standard batter y. Only under extreme conditions in which one or more tests comprising the standard battery cannot Drugs and C osmetics Rules 1945 610 be employed for technical reasons, alternative validated tests can serve as substitutes provided sufficient scientific justification should be provided to support the argument that a given standard battery test is not appropriate. Both in-vitro and in-vivo studies shou ld be done. In-vitro include Ames' Salmonella assay and chromosomal aberr ations (CA) in In -vivo studies should include micronucleus assay (MNA) or CA in rodent bone marrow. Data anal ysis of CA of gaps.' Cytotoxic anticancer agents: Genoto xicity data are not required before Phase I and II trials. But these studies should be completed before applying for Phase III trials. Notes: Ames' Test (Rev erse mutation assay (pKM101) be (i) In-vitro exposure (with and without metabolic activation, S9 mix) should be done at a minimum of 5 log dose levels. Solvent and positive control shou ld be used. Positive control may include 9-amino-acridine, 2 -nitrofluorine, sodium azide and mit omycin C, respectivel y, in the tester strains mentioned above. Each set should consist of at least three replicates. A 2.5 fold (or more) increase in number of revertants in comparison to spontaneous revertants would be considered positive. (ii) In-vitro cytogenetic assay : The desired level of toxicity for in vitro cytogenet ic tests using cell lines should be greater than 50% reduction in cell number or culture confluen cy. For lymphocyte cultures, an inhibiti on of mitotic index by greater than 50% is considered sufficient. It should be perfor med in CHO cells or on human lymphocyte in culture. In-vitro exposure (with and without metabolic activation, S9 mix) shou ld be done using a minimum of 3 log doses. Solvent and positive control should be included. A positive control like Cyclophospha mide with metabolic activation and Mito mycin C for without metabolic activation shou ld be used to give a reproducible and detectable increa se clastogenic effect over the background which demonstrates the sensitivity of the test s ystem. Each set should consist of at least three replicates. Increased nu mber of aberrations in metaphase chromosomes should be used as the criteria for evaluation. (iii) In-vivo micronucleus assay: One rodent species (preferably mouse) is needed. Route of administration of test substance should be the same as intended for humans. Five an imals per sex per dose groups should be used. At least three dose levels, plus solvent and positive control should be tested. A positive control like mitomycin C or cyclophosph amide should be used. Dosing should be done on day 1 and 2 of study followed by sacrifice of animals 6 hours after the last injectio n. Bone marrow from both the femora should be taken out, flushed with fetal bovine serum (20 min.), pelletted and smeared on glass slides. Giemsa -MayGruenw ald staining should be done and increased number of micronuclei in polychromatic erythrocytes (minimum 1000) should be used as the evaluation criteria. (iv) In -vivo cytogenetic assay: One rodent species (preferably rat) is to be used. Route of administration of test substance should be the same as intended for humans. Five animals/sex/dose groups s hould be used. At least three dose levels, plus solvent and positive control should be tested. Positive control may include cyclophosphamide. Dosing should be done on day 1 followed by intra -peritoneal colchicine administration at 22 hours. Animal s should be sacrificed 2 hours after colchicine administration. Bone marrow from both the femora should be taken out, flushed with hypotonic saline (20 min.), Drugs and C osmetics Rules 1945 611 pelletted and resuspended in Carnoy's fluid. Once again the cells should be pelletted and dropped on clean glass slides with a Pasteur pipette. Giemsa staining should be done and increased number of aberrations in metaphase chromosomes (minimum 100) should be used as the evaluation criteria. 1.7 Carci nogenicity (see Appendix I, item 4.8) Carcinogenicity studies should be performed for all drugs that are expected to be clinically used for more than 6 months as well as for drugs used frequent ly in an inter mittent manner in the treatment of chronic or recurrent conditions. Carci nogenicit y studies are also to be performed for drugs if there is concern about their carcinogenic potential emanating from previous demonstrat ion of carcinogenic potential in the product class that is considered relevant to humans or where structure -activity relationship suggests carcinogenic risk or when there is evidence of preneoplastic lesions in repeated dose toxicity studies or when long-term tissue retention of parent compound or metabolite(s) results in local tissue reactions or other pathoph ysiological responses. For pharmac euticals deve loped to treat certain serious diseases, Licensing Authori ty may allow carcinogenici ty testing to be conducted after marketing permission has been granted. In instances where the life-expec tancy in the indicated population is short (i.e., less than 2-3 years) - no long-term carcinogenicity studies may be required. In cases where the therapeutic agent for cancer is generally successful and life is significant ly prolonged there may be later concerns regarding sec ondary cancers. When such drugs are intended for adjuvant therapy in tumour free patients or for prolonged use in non-cancer indications, carcinogenicity studies may be / are needed. Completed rodent carcinogenici ty studies are not needed in advance of the conduct of large scale clinical trials, unless there is special conce rn for the patie nt population. Carcinogenici ty studies should be done in a rodent species (preferably rat). Mouse may be employed on ly with proper scientific justification. The selected strain of animals should not have a very high or very low incidence of spontaneous tumors. At least three dose levels should be used. The highest dose should be sub -lethal, and it should not reduce the life span of animals by more than 10% of e xpected normal. The lowest dose should be comparable to the intended human therapeutic dose or a multiple of it, e.g. 2.5x; to make allowance for the sensitivity of the species. The intermediate dose to be placed logarithmically between the other two dos es. An untreated control and (if indicated) a vehicle control group should be included. The drug should be administered 7 days a week for a fraction of the life span comparable to the fraction of human life span over which the drug is likely to be used the rapeutically. Generally, the period of dosing should be 24 months for rats and 18 months for mice. Observations should include macroscopic changes observed at autopsy and detailed histopathology of organs and tissues. Additional tests for carcinogenici ty (short -term bioassays, neonatal mouse assay or tests employing transgenic animals) may also be done depending on their applicability on a case to case basis. Note: Each dose group and concurrent control group not intended to be sacrificed early shou ld contain atleast 50 animals of each sex. A high dose sattelite group for evaluation of pathology other than neoplasia shou ld contain 20 animals of each sex while the sattelite control group should contain 10 animals of each sex. Observation parameters should include signs of intoxication, effect on body weight, food intak e, clinical chemis try parameters, hematology para meters, urine analysis, organ weights, gross patholo gy and detailed histopathol ogy. Comprehens ive descriptions of benign and Drugs and C osmetics Rules 1945 612 malignant tumour develop ment, time of their detection, site, di mensions, histolog ical typing etc. should be given. 1.8 Animal toxicity requirements for clinical trials and marketing of a new drug.

In case an application is made for initiating the Phase IV trial, complete details of the non-clinical safety data needed for obtaining the permissions for Phase I, II and III trials, as per the list p rovided above must be submitted. Application Of Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) The animal studies be conducted in an accredited laboratory. Where the safety pharmacology studies are part of toxicol ogy studies, these studies should also be conducted in an accredited laborato ry. 1. General Principles APPEN DIX IV ANIMAL PHARMACOLOGY Specific and general pharmacological studies should be conducted to support use of therapeutics in humans. In the early stages of drug development enou gh information may not be available to rationally select study design for safety asses sment. In such a situation, a general approach to safety pharmacology studies can be appli ed. Safety pharmacolo gy studi es are studies that investigate potential undesir able pharmacod ynamic effects of a substance on p hysiological functions in relation to exposure within the therapeutic range or above. 1.1 Specific Pharmacologi cal Actions Specif ic pharmacological actions are those which demonstra te the therapeutic potential for humans. The specific studies that should be co nducted and their design will be different based on the individual properties and intended uses of investigational drug. Scientifically validated methods should be used. The use of new technologies and methodologies in accordance with sound scientific princip les should be preferred. 1.2 General Pharmacological Actions 1.2.1 Essential Safety Pharmacology Safety pharmacology s tudies need to be conducted to invest igate the potential undesirable pharmacod ynamic effects of a substance on physiological funct ions in relation to exposure within the therapeutic range and above. These studies should be designed to identify undesirable pharmacodyn amic properties of a substance that may have relevance to its h uman safet y; to evaluate adverse pharmacod ynamic and/or effects observed in toxicol ogy and/or clinical studies; and to investigate the mechani sm of the adve rse pharmacodynamic eff ects observed and/or suspected. The aim of the essential safety pharm acology is to study the effects of the test drug on vital functions. Vital organ systems such as cardiovascular, re spiratory and central nervous systems should be studied. Essential safety pharmacology studies may be excluded or supple mented based on scientific rationale. Also, the exclusion of certain Drugs and C osmetics Rules 1945 618 test(s) or exploration(s) of certain organs, s ystems or functions should be scientifically justified. 1.2.1.1 Cardiovas cular System Effects of the investigational drug should be studi ed on blood pressure, heart rate, and the electrocardi ogram. If possible in vitro, in vivo methods includi ng electrop also be considered. 1.2.1.2 Cent ral Nervo us System Effects of the investigatio nal drug shou ld be st udied on motor activi ty, behavio ral changes, coordination, sensory and motor reflex responses and body temperature. 1.2.1.3 Respiratory System Effects of the investigational drug on respi ratory rate and other functions such as tidal volume and hemoglobin oxygen saturation should be studied. 1.3 Follow-up and Supp lemental Safety Pharmacology Studies In addition to the essential safety pharmac ological studies, additional suppl emental and follow -up safety pharmacology studies may need to be conducted as appropriate. These depend on the pharmacological properties or chemical class of the test substance, and the data generated from safety pharmacology studies, clinical trials, pharmacovigilance, experime ntal in vitro or in vivo studies, or from literature reports. 1.3.1 Follow -up Studies For Essential Safety Pharmacology Follow -up studies provide additional infor mation or a better understandi ng than that provided by the essential safety pharmacolog y. 1.3.1.1 Cardiovascular System These include ventricular contractilit y, vascular resistance and the effects of che mical mediators, their agonists and antagonists on the cardiovascular system. 1.3.1.2 Central Nervous System These include behavioral studies , learning and memory, electroph ysiology studies , neuroche mistry and ligand binding studies. 1.3.1.3 Respiratory System These include airway resistance, compliance, pulmonary arterial pressure, blood gases and blood pH. 1.3.2 Supplemental Safety Pharma cology Studies These studies are required to investigate the possible adverse pharmacological effects that are not assessed in the essential safety pharmacological studies and are a cause for concern. Drugs and C osmetics Rules 1945 619 1.3.2.1 Urinary System These include urine volume , specific gravi ty, osmolality, pH, proteins, cytology and blood urea nitrogen, creatinine and plasma proteins estimation. 1.3.2.2 Autonomic Nervous System These include binding to receptors re levant for the autono mic ne rvous system, and functional respon se to agonist or antagonist responses in vivo or in vitro, and effects of direct stimulation of autonomic nerves and their effects on cardiovascular responses. 1.3.2.3 Gastrointestinal System These include studies on gastric secretion, gastric pH measurement, gastr ic mucosal examination, bile secretion, gastric emptying time in vivo and ileocae cal contraction in vitro. 1.3.2.4 Other Organ Systems Effects of the investigational drug on organ systems not investigated elsewhe re should be assessed when there is a cause for concern. For example dependen cy potential, skeletal muscle, immune and endocrine functions may be investigated. 1.4 Conditions Under Which Safety Pharmacology Studies Are Not Necessary Safety pharmacolo gy studies are usually not required for locally applied agents e.g. dermal or ocular, in cases when the pharmacology of the investigational drug is well known, and/or when systemic absorption from the site of application is low. Safety pharmacology testing is also not necessary, in the case of a new derivative having similar pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. 1.5 Timing Of Safety Pharmacology Studies In Relation To Clinical Development 1.5.1 Prior To First Administration In Humans The effects of an investigational drug on the vital functions listed in the essential safety pharmacology should be studied prior to first administration in hu mans. Any follow -up or supplemental studies ident ified, shou ld be conducted if neces sary, based on a cause for concern. 1.5.2 During Clinical Dev elopment Additional investigations may be warranted to clarify observed or suspected adverse effects in animals and humans during clinical development 1.5.3 Before applying for marketing Approval Follow -up and supple mental safety pharmacology studies should be assessed prior to approval unless not required, in w hich case this should be justified. Available information from toxicology studies addressing safety pharmacology endpoints or information from clinical s tudies can replace such studies. 1.6 Applicat ion Of Good Laborato ry Practices (GLP) The animal studies be conducted in an accredited laborator y. Where the safety pharmacology studies are part of toxicology studies, these studies should also be conducted in an accredited laborator y.

FDCs can be divided into the following groups and data required for approval for marketing is described below: (a) The first group of FDCs includes those in which one or more of the active ingredients is a new drug. For such FDCs to be approved for marketing data to be sub mitted will be similar to data required for any new drug (including clinical trials) [see rule 122E, item (a)]. (b)(i) The second group FDCs includes those in which active ingredients alrea dy approved/ marketed individually are combined for the first time, for a particular claim and where the ingredients are likely to have significant interaction of a pharmacodyna mic or pharmacokineti c nature [see rule 122E, item (c)]. If clinical trials have been carried out with the FDC in other countries, reports of such trials shou ld be submitted. If the FDC is marketed abroad, the regulatory status in other coun tries should be stated. (see Appen dix I, item 9). (ii) For marketing permission, approp riate chemical and pharma ceutical data will be sub mitted. In case such a combination is not marketed anywhere in the world but these drugs are already in use conco mitantly (not as an FDC but individual ly) for the said cla im, marke ting permission may be granted based on chemical and pharmaceutical data. Data showing the stabili ty of the propo sed dosage form will also have to be submitted. (iii) For any other such FDCs, clinical trials may be required. For obtaining per mission to carry out clinical trials with such FDCs a summary of available pharmacological, toxicolo gical and clinical data on the individual ingredients should be sub mitted, along with the rationale for combining them in the proposed ratio. In addition, acute toxicity data (LD 50) and pharmacological data should be submitted on the indiv idual ingredients as well as their combination in the proposed ratio. (c) The third group of FDCs includes those which are already marketed, but in which it is proposed either to change the ratio of active ingredients or to make a new therapeutic claim. For such FDCs, the appropriate rationale including publish ed reports (if any) shou ld be submitted to obtain marketing permission. Permission will be granted depending upon the nature of the claim and data submitted. (d) The fourth group of FDC includes those whose indiv idual active ingredients (or drugs from the same class) have been widely used in a particular indication(s) for years, their concomitant use is often necessary and no claim is proposed to be made other than convenience. It will have to be demonstrated that the proposed dosage form is stable and the ingredie nts are unlikely to have significant interaction of a pharmacod ynamic or pharmacokinetic nature. No additional animal or human data are general ly required for these FDCs, and marketing pe rmission may be granted if the FDC has an acceptable rationale.

Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1945 627 APPEN DIX IX STAB ILITY TESTI NG OF NEW DRUGS Stabil ity testing is to be perfor med to provide evidence on how the quality of a drug substance or formulation varies with time under the influence of various envir onmental factors such as temperature, humidity and light, and to establish shelf life for the formulation and rec ommend ed storage conditions. Stability studies should include testing of those attributes of the drug substance that are susceptible to change during storage and are likely to influence quality, safet y, and/or efficac y. In case of formulations the testing should cover, as appropriate, the ph ysical, chemical, biological, and microbiological attributes, preservati ve content (e.g., antioxidant, antimicrobi al preservative), and functionality tests (e.g., for a dose delivery system). Validated stabili ty-indicating analytical procedures should be applied. For long term studies, frequency of testing should be sufficient to establish the stabili ty profi le of the drug substance. In general, a drug substance should be evaluated under storage condit ions that test its ther mal stability and, if applicable, its sensitivi ty to moisture. The storage conditions and the length of studies chosen should be sufficient to cover storage, shipment and subsequent use. Stress testing of the drug substance should be conducted to identify the likely degradatio n products, which in turn establish the degradation pathways, evaluate the intrinsic stability of the molecule and validate the stabili ty indicating power of the analytical procedures used. The nature of the stress testing will depend on the individual dru g substance a nd the type of for mulation involve d. Stress testing may generally be carried out on a single batch of the drug substance. It should include the effect of temperatures ), humidity where appropriate, oxidation, and photo lysis on the drug substance. Data should be provided for (a) Photostability on at least one primary batch of the drug substance as well as the formulation, as the case may be and (b) the susceptibility of the drug substance to hydrolysis across a wide range of pH value s when in solution or suspension. Long -term testing should cover a minimum of 12 months' duration on at least three primary batches of the drug substance or the formulation at the time of submission and should be continued for a period of time sufficient to cover the proposed shelf life. Accelera ted testing shou ld cover a minimum of 6 months duration at the time of submission. In case of drug substances, the batches should be manufactured to a minimum of pilot scale by the same synthetic route and using a method of manufacture that simulates the final process to be used for production batches. In case of formulations, two of the three batches should be at least pilot scale and the third one may be smaller. The manufacturing process(es) used for primary batches should simulate that to be applied to production bat ches and should provide products of the same quality and meeting the same specifications as that intended for marketing. The stabi lity studies for drug substances should be conducted either in the same container - closure system as proposed for storage and distribution or in a container - closure system that simulates the proposed final packaging. In case of fo rmulations, the stability studies should be conducted in the final container - closure system proposed for marketing. Stability Testing of new drug subst ances and formulations: (i) Study conditions for drug substances and formulations intended to be stored under general conditions Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1945 628 Study Study conditions Duration of study Long term 30\u00b0C at any time during 6 months' testing under the accelerated storage condit ion, such changes occur that cause the product to fail in complying with the prescribed standard s, additional testing under an intermediate storage condit ion should be conducted and evaluated against significant change criteria. (ii) Study conditions for drug substances and formulations intend ed to be stored in a refrigerator Study Study conditions Duration of study Long term 5\u00b0C (iii) Study conditions for drug substances and formulations intend ed to be stored in a free zer Study Study conditions Duration of study____________________ Long term - 20\u00b0C \u00b1 5\u00b0C 12 months (iv) Drug substances intended for storage below -20\u00b0C shall be treated on a case -by- case basis. (v) Stabili ty testing of the formulation after constitution or dilution, if applicable, should be conducted to provide information for the labelling on the preparati on, storage condition, and in-use period of the constituted or diluted product. This testing should be performed on the constitu ted or diluted product through the proposed in-use period. APPENDIX X CONTENTS OF THE PROPOSED PRO TOCOL FOR CONDUC TING CLINICAL TRIALS 1.
