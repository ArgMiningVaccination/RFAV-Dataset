Your body tells the stories of your past, and sometimes how you feel about yourself is directly related to how you view your injuries or experiences \u2014 especially if they have resulted in scarring. Since scars can be quite noticeable, they can make you feel self-conscious about your appearance. If you would like to minimize the appearance of your scars, Dr. Nathan Brought and the team at Southern Plastic and Reconstructive Surgical Institute want to assist you. [Schedule A Scar Consultation Today](/contact) Common Types of Scarring Scar tissue is a natural part of the healing process when you're injured or undergo some types of surgeries. However, it is more fibrous than your normal skin, which can make it very visible. Understanding the scars you have and how they form helps with applying the correct remedy for healing. The following list identifies some of the most common types of scarring that occur after even some of the simplest injuries: - Keloid Scarring: These scars form from intrusive healing processes and can extend beyond the injury site. Depending on the size of the scar and its location, this type can prohibit movement and appear after extensive irritation to the skin. - Contracture Scars: This type of scarring often forms after a severe burn or trauma, and can cause the skin to tighten. Similar to other forms of scarring, contracture scars can prohibit movement depending on their location. - Hypertrophic Scars: These scars are similar to keloid scars. They stay within the site of the injury and can rise above the skin, causing discomfort. - Acne Scars: This common type of scarring can occur from severe acne that presents itself at any age. Even with effective acne treatment, acne scars can last a lifetime in the forms of pits or deep pores on the skin. - Atrophic Scars: These are pit-like appearances in the skin. Atrophic scars come about when fat or layers of tissue are lost. - Stretch Marks: Stretch marks occur when the skin stretches too quickly. This is a common form of scarring for women going through pregnancy. While scars can be difficult to identify and predict, natural remedies do exist to help in scar removal. How to Remove Scars at Home It is possible to assist in your body's healing of scars or unwanted marks. Attending to scars does not have to be extraneous or expensive if you don't wish it to be. If you are trying to heal scars naturally without surgery, take a look at these inexpensive remedies you can perform from the comfort of your own home: - Aloe Vera: You can either pull back the dark green skin layer of an aloe leaf or purchase a topical gel. Gently apply the clear gel to scars twice a day in a soft, circular motion. Rinse off the gel after about 30 minutes with cool water. Repeat this practice once in the morning and once in the evening for scar improvement. - Vitamin E: Pour a vitamin E capsule over a scar and massage for several minutes. Wash off the oil and repeat this process multiple times a day. - Apple Cider Vinegar: Make a solution by combining a few tablespoons of distilled water with one tablespoon of apple cider vinegar. Dip a cotton ball into the solution and place it on top of your scar. Cover the cotton ball with a Band-Aid or piece of medical tape to keep it from moving. Wash off the solution after a few minutes, and be sure to moisturize to replenish the skin. - Lavender Essential Oil: Place three drops of lavender essential oil into about three tablespoons of extra-virgin olive oil. Massage this mixture on the scar for five minutes. Leave the oil in place for thirty minutes and rinse. - Honey: Spread honey on the scar and cover with a Band-Aid overnight. Wash off of the scar in the morning and repeat nightly. - Coconut Oil: Heat the coconut oil slightly so it melts. Massage the scar with oil for 10 minutes and rinse. - Lemon/Lime Juice: Place lemon or lime juice on the scar with a cloth. Let this sit for a few minutes on the skin before washing it off. The acidic qualities of the juice help remove dead skin cells along the scar and can lessen the redness or appearance of scars. - Drinking Water: While this is not a topical cream, drinking plenty of water promotes hydrated and healthy skin. Be sure you are drinking plenty of water each day to assist these home remedies in the healing of your scars. Minimizing the Appearance of Scars When trying these natural remedies for scar removal, it is important to remember that these are not guaranteed to erase scars completely. The natural remedies listed work for some, but you must keep up and repeat these actions regularly to see improvement. Always take precaution with home remedies to find a healthy balance when you expose your skin to any solutions. Overexposure to chemicals can sometimes dry out your skin and cause it to grow irritated, so always be sure to stick to the minimal exposure timeframes. If one remedy does not show the results you're looking for after an extended period, contacting Dr. Brought might be the best solution for you. At Southern Plastic & Reconstructive Surgical Institute, we offer [a number of medical services](https://www.sprsi.com/about/dr-brought) to enhance your everyday life. Services at Southern Plastic & Reconstructive Surgical Institute Dr. Brought dedicates his practice to restoring parts of your body to where you would like them to be. Paying close attention to your face, body, and skin, we guide patients through rejuvenation procedures. From injectable fillers, lifting procedures, abdominoplasty, and liposuction, we can find the right solution to scarring and unwanted features. Using a holistic approach to health and wellness, Dr. Brought and his team evaluate each patient for the best option toward recovery. Instead of going through an automated screening, Dr. Brought prefers to speak one-on-one with each of his patients to find the solution that is tailored to what the patient wants to achieve. Here are a couple of the treatments we can provide to minimize the appearance of scars: 1. Scar Camouflage Services Dr. Brought and his staff can often [hide scars from past surgeries](https://www.sprsi.com/spa-procedures/scar-camouflage) or injuries as if they never happened. Scar camouflage infuses skin-toned color into the scars. It is essentially a medical tattoo to make the scar the same color as the rest of your skin \u2014 which makes them much less apparent. 2. Dermal Fillers Skin Procedure Whether you are fighting scars or wrinkles, Dr. Brought can [inject dermal fillers to stimulate your features](https://www.sprsi.com/face-procedures/fillers). Lasting up to about 18 months, dermal fillers can plump up the skin and sit just under the injection area. Dermal fillers add volume to an area, so they can be especially useful for reducing the appearance of acne scars. They are different than Botox, which relaxes the nerves and muscles under the skin. 3. Microneedling When skin becomes damaged, the body produces collagen to repair it. This substance can keep the skin healthy and improve its overall look, minimizing the appearance of scars by replacing scar tissue with normal skin cells. To stimulate collagen production, Dr. Brought and his team can use [a technique called microneedling](https://www.sprsi.com/spa-procedures/microneedling). This treatment simulates damage to the skin by piercing it with very small, precise needles. When applied to a scar, microneedling can improve the appearance of the site with minimal discomfort and a smooth recovery. 4. Steroid Injections Depending on the type of scar you have, Dr. Brought may recommend steroid injections to help reduce its size. If you decide to pursue this treatment route, a corticosteroid solution will be injected into the scar, where it will work to break up collagen fibers and reduce the amount of thickened scar tissue present. Though this process may take several weeks and may not remove a scar completely, it's a simple, non-invasive way to minimize a scar's appearance. 5. Laser Therapy Laser therapy or [Intense Pulsed Light (IPL)](https://www.sprsi.com/spa-procedures/ipl-skin-treatment.php) therapy uses powerful wavelengths of light to eliminate scar tissue below the surface and stimulate collagen production. After repeated applications, this type of treatment can cause a scar to fade. If you decide to have laser therapy, Dr. Brought and his team will apply light from the laser with high precision, so the skin around the scar is left unaffected.
