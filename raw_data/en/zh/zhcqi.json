How can I prevent getting infected with COVID 19? 5 Answers [Dr. Michael A. Meloni](/Expert/1067297-Michael-A-Meloni)Emergency Physician Melbourne, FL How old are you? What are your concerns about getting COVID? Have you had the COVID vaccine, and the booster? Unless you have a severe medical problem or chronic disease, ff you have had the COVID vaccine and the booster, you need to go out and live your life. Don't worry about COVID. Be happy.... [Dr. Timothy J. Chilcote](/Expert/1158127-Timothy-J-Chilcote)Emergency Physician Overland Park, KS Vaccinate. Boost. [Dr. Michael Ein](/Expert/457918-Michael-Ein)Infectious Disease Specialist Concord, CA First of all, if you are afraid of getting COVID-19 you should get vaccinated and boosted with either the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines. This will decrease your risk of severe disease or death and should help assuage your fear. You should avoid indoor gatherings with large crowds. You should wear a properly fitting N95 mask when in doors with people, like when shopping or on public transit. When reported cases in your area are less than 30 per 100,000 per day you can safely gather with less than 10 friends or eat at small restaurants (hopefully well ventilated). There will always be some risk of infection but by following these guidelines your risk will be low and if you do get infected your risk of severe disease will also be low.

Dickinson](/Expert/1457212-Gordon-M-Dickinson)Infectious Disease Specialist Miami, FL Good question The answer will depend upon who you are: age, immunological status, what you do - work, play, etc. Contrary to what you read and hear, masks do work, but to be fully protected you need to wear a good fitting N-95 mask whenever in close contact with infected persons. A well fitted N-95 mask is protective, but getting and keeping the close fit is hard. So vaccination is arguably the best protection but we know it is highly protective against serious illness but less vs infection Still you should be vaccinated and keep up with boosters as recommended as we live through this epidemic. Absolute protection is difficult if you want a life. You could move to a mountain top in Idaho without contact with the outside world and be absolutely protected but that is not a life for most of us. You could wear an N95 respirator and wear a hazmat costume but that's no fun either So be vaccinated and wear a good fitting N95 mask when close to other people and you have best chance of avoiding infection G dickinson The answer will depend upon who you are: age, immunological status, what you do - work, play, etc. Contrary to what you read and hear, masks do work, but to be fully protected you need to wear a good fitting N-95 mask whenever in close contact with infected persons.

Wear masks indoors. In short, follow common sense self-protection guides. "}
