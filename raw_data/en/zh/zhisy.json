TCM is an elegant, time-honored system of medicine that respects the energetic as well as the physical aspect of our being. It is the longest practiced professional medicine in the world. Once a TCM diagnosis is obtained, Dr. Hughes develops an individualized treatment protocol using acupuncture, dietary recommendations and/or supplementation. The goal of TCM and acupuncture is to establish an internal balance between the mind, body, spirit and the external environment. Acupuncture is an ancient Chinese healing art and one of the most widely used medical systems in the world which has helped literally billions of people. Essentially it is a painless technique which employs the insertion of fine needles into specific acupuncture points of the body that lie on energy meridians and are directly related to specific organs and physiological functions. The technique manipulates the flow of bio-energy (\"qi\"), thereby restoring balance, removing blockages and adding energy where necessary. "}
