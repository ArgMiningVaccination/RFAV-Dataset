Most people recover in a week or two, but RSV can be serious. Infants and older adults are more likely to develop severe RSV and need hospitalization. Vaccines are available to protect older adults from severe RSV. Monoclonal antibody products are available to protect infants and young children from severe RSV. CDC Recommends: Adults 60 years old and over: - Adults 60 years of age and older may receive a single dose of RSV vaccine using shared clinical decision-making. Infants and young children: - 1 dose of nirsevimab for all infants younger than 8 months born during or entering their first RSV season. - 1 dose of nirsevimab for infants and children 8-19 months old who are at increased risk for severe RSV disease and entering their second RSV season. - Note: A different monoclonal antibody, palivizumab, is limited to children under 24 months of age with certain conditions that place them at high risk for severe RSV disease. It must be given once a month during RSV season. Please see [AAP guidelines for palivizumab.](https://www.aap.org/en/pages/2019-novel-coronavirus-covid-19-infections/clinical-guidance/interim-guidance-for-use-of-palivizumab-prophylaxis-to-prevent-hospitalization/) If you have any questions about RSV or the products above, talk to your healthcare provider.
