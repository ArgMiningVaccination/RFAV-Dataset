Chiropractic care can help with a broad range of physical problems, from basic aches and pains to much more complex musculoskeletal issues. Taking care of your spine means taking care of your entire nervous system. When you take care of your nervous system, your entire body can benefit. This is why there are so many great benefits of chiropractic care that the average person doesn't even know about. Here are just some of the health concerns Chiropractic care can improve in some individuals: - Headaches - Low back pain - Sciatica - Sports Injuries - Neck pain - Carpal Tunnel Syndrome - Shoulder pain - Nerve pain - Ankle and foot pain - Stress relief - Improved Posture - Enhanced Nervous System Function - Strengthened Immune System Function - Improved Sleep Our massage practitioners are very well experienced and primarily focus on medical massage.

Benefits of massage People seek massage therapy for various reasons - whether looking to reduce stress/anxiety, rehabilitate injuries, reduce pain, relax muscles and promote overall health and wellness. Benefits of massage include: - Enhanced tissue healing - Reduced muscular tension - Improved blood and lymph flow - Greater flexibility and range of motion - Relief of tension-related conditions (Headaches, eyestrain, and jaw issues) - Reduced stress and anxiety - Increased blood circulation, allowing for expanded lung capacity, stamina, and efficiency. Benefits of Acupuncture Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) The Chinese healing arts of acupuncture and herbal medicine were developed through 5,000 years of practice and observation. Like modern western medicine, Chinese medicine is a systematic, organized, and highly refined practice. Today, many western physicians and the World Health Organization recognize acupuncture and herbs for their effectiveness in a variety of conditions. The spectrum of illness for which acupuncture has proven evidence for efficacy is rapidly expanding. Acupuncture Acupuncture is known for balancing and regulating the functional aspects of the body - maintaining proper movement of the lungs and the gastrointestinal tract functions for example. Acupuncture is also excellent for regulating blood and energy flow within the body, thus helps relax tension, stress and stagnation. Herbal Medicine Herbal medicine is very effective for building up the body's fundamental reserves and toning physical components such as blood and fluids, as well as warmth and energy. Also, herbal medicine is often the most appropriate choice of treatment in acute ailments where there is significant infection or inflammation, as traditional Chinese herbs have high anti-bacterial, anti-viral, and anti-fungal functions. Combined Therapy (Acupuncture and Herbal Medicine) Acupuncture and herbal therapies work hand in hand to best help strengthen and regulate the body's healthy functioning in most cases. In other scenarios, each alone might suffice. A patient may prefer one to the other for personal reasons. We often work with patients and their western doctors to develop a treatment plan that complements and supports their primary health care regime. For instance, Chinese medicine can be useful in countering or minimizing some of the significant adverse effects of pharmaceutical drugs, especially in situations like chemotherapy or radiation therapy. The understanding of both philosophies can help target our Chinese medical treatments and improve the treatment outcomes. Naturopathy Benefits Naturopathy offers an alternative to conventional medicine that many patients prefer. Some patients even decide to try naturopathic treatments after conventional medicine has failed to identify or treat their health issues. Naturopathic doctors work closely with the patient to help identify the problems that are causing symptoms, rather than just treating the symptoms reported. The goal of naturopathic medicine is to promote whole body health without invasive procedures or strong pharmaceuticals. Naturopathy employs the use of natural and non-invasive techniques that are designed to encourage the body to heal itself. Through naturopathic treatments, some patients can find relief from chronic fatigue, pain, hormonal imbalances, gastrointestinal issues, and so much more. Personalized approach: Naturopathic medicine recognizes that every individual is unique, and therefore requires a personalized approach to healthcare. A naturopathic doctor (ND) takes the time to understand each patient's medical history, lifestyle, and environmental factors to develop an individualized treatment plan. Emphasis on prevention: Naturopathic medicine emphasizes preventing disease before it occurs. NDs work with patients to identify potential health risks and develop strategies to reduce or eliminate them. Natural remedies: Naturopathic medicine utilizes natural remedies such as herbs, supplements, and homeopathy to promote healing. These remedies often have fewer side effects than conventional medications and are generally safe for most people. Focus on overall health: Naturopathic medicine is a holistic approach to healthcare that focuses on the overall health of the individual, rather than just treating specific symptoms. NDs work with patients to promote overall wellness by addressing all aspects of health, including physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual well-being. Integrative approach: Naturopathic medicine is an integrative approach to healthcare that combines conventional and natural therapies. NDs work with other healthcare providers to ensure that patients receive the best possible care. Reduced dependence on medication: Naturopathic medicine promotes the use of natural remedies to treat illness, which can reduce a patient's dependence on conventional medications. This can be particularly beneficial for individuals who have experienced adverse reactions to conventional medications or who wish to avoid them altogether. Improved quality of life: Naturopathic medicine can improve the quality of life for individuals living with chronic conditions by providing natural, non-invasive therapies that address the root cause of the condition rather than just the symptoms.
