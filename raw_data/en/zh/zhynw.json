How I Can Help You My Medicine Bundle Homeopathy Homeopathy is a wholistic healing art that recognises the body, mind and emotions as one integrated whole in the quest for optimal health, well-being and transformation. [Meditation](http://homeopathybyarunjot.co.uk/) Meditation is an ancient technology that develops awareness, promotes relaxation, providing a sense of calm, peace and balance. Meditation can benefit both your emotional well-being as well as your overall physical health. There are many techniques, and in my classes I will explore some of these with you, with the emphasis being on healing and pain relief. Breathwork For those of you who practise meditation such as anapana sati or pranayama, you will already understand how closely correlated the breath is to our thoughts and emotions. Or just remember back to the last time you were excited or angry and how your breathing reflected this state. Hi, I'm Arunjot Welcome to my page which I hope provides a flavour of my style and approach as a Natural Health Care Practitioner and Homeopath. I understand reaching out to a complete stranger can sometimes feel daunting and that it's really important to have trust and a good resonance with the therapist you choose to work with. So feel free to connect with me for a free 15min discovery call. I qualified as a professional Homeopath almost thirty years ago so I look forward to bringing this experience in service to your healing journey, and in supporting you to meet your personal health goals during the course of your treatment with me. About Homeopathy Homeopathy is an individualised, patient-centred approach to health and well- being. The therapeutic healing response is elicited by both the consultation process between client and practitioner as well as by the remedies. What my clients say: My children always ask for Arun first when they don't feel so well. I want to thank Arunjot for her support and wisdom while I went through a very challenging health crisis and I'm so grateful to her for all that she has done for me. I highly rate Arun as a homeopath and for her wisdom and support. "}
