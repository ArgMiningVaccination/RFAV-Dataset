Her approach to healing concentrates on a MIND, BODY and SPIRIT connection understanding that our bodies only have on way to communicate with us and that is through symptoms. The greater awareness we have of ourselves and our bodies, the easier it is to heal. Jen is a gentle, loving and compassionate healer who cares for her patients in truly unique way, providing guidance and support along their journeys to better health. Homeopathy Homeopathic remedies work by stimulating the body's own ability to heal. You might think of a remedy as a bit of information - a trigger that sets the body's inherent ability to heal into action. Many ailments, such as the common cold, can cure themselves over time, but in more chronic diseases, the body requires assistance. In homeopathy, this assistance is provided by way of a Homeopathic remedy to provide the stimulus your body needs to set the curative process into action. With the correctly prescribed homeopathic remedy, your body is allowed to return to a more normal state of functioning - naturally, safely and with no side effects. Jen is a registered Classical Homeopath with the Canadian College of Homeopaths and a graduate of the Canadian College of Homeopathic Medicine. Reiki Reiki is a simple, natural and safe method of spiritual healing and self-improvement that everyone can use. It has been effective in helping virtually every known illness and malady and always creates a beneficial effect. It also works in conjunction with all other medical or therapeutic techniques to relieve side effects and promote recovery. Jen is trained in Usui Reiki and has her Masters Level. You can find Jen in our Treatment Room on Tuesdays & Thursdays.
