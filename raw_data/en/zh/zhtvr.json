Public Hearing for Notice of Final Regulation -- Proposed Amendment of R egulation 61-62, Air Pollution Control Regulations and Standards, Exempt from General Assembly review, Document No. 48 70 2. Notice of Proposed Regulation Amending Regulation 61 -62, Air Pollution Control Regulations and Standards, Review by General Assembly required Executive Session (if needed) Adjournment Note: The next scheduled meeting is February 7 , 2019 . Date: January 3, 2019 To: S.C. Board of Health and Environmental Control From: Bureau of Air Quality Re: Public Hearing for Notice of Final Regulation Proposed Amendment of R.61-62, Air Pollution Control Regulations and Standards Exempt from General Assembly Review Document No. 4870 I. Introduction The Bureau of Air Quality (\"Bur eau\") proposes the attached Notice of Final Regulation amending R.61- 62, Air Pollution Control Regulations and Standards , and the South Carolina Air Quality Implementation Plan (\"SIP\"), for publication in the January 25, 2019, South Carolina State Register (\"State Register\") . Legal authority for this amendment resides in the Sout h Carolina Pollution Control Act, S.C. Code Sections 48-1-10 et seq. (\"Pollution Control Act\"), which au thorizes the Department to adopt emission control regulations, standards, and limitations, and take all ac tions necessary or appropriate to secure to the state the benefits of federal air pollutio n control laws. The Administrative Procedures Act, S.C. Code Section 1- 23-120(H)(1), exempts this amendment from General Assembly review, as the Department promulgates this amendment for compliance with federal air pollu tion control laws. The amendment will take legal effect as of the January 25, 2019, publication in the State Register. II. Facts 1. Pursuant to the Pollution Control Act and the fede ral Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. Sections 7410, 7413, and 7416, the Department must ensure national primar y and secondary ambient air quality standards are achieved and maintained in South Carolina. No stat e may adopt or enforce an emission standard or limitation less stringent than these federal standards or limitations pursuant to 42 U.S.C. Section 7416. 2. The United States Environmental Protection Agency promulgates amendments to the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) throughout each calendar year. Recen t federal amendments to 40 CFR Parts 60, 61, and 63 include revisions to New Source Performance St andards (NSPS) mandated by 42 U.S.C. Section 7411, federal National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) mandated by 42 U.S.C. Section 7412, and federal National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) for Source Categories mandated by 42 U.S.C. Section 7412. 3. The Department is amending R.61-62.60, South Carolina Designated Facility Plan and New Source Performance Standards ; R.61-62.61, National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) ; and R.61-62.63, National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) for Source Categories , to adopt the federal amendments to these standards promulgated from January 1, 2017, through December 31, 2017. 4. The Department is amending R.61-62.68, Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions , including corrections for internal consistency, clarification, chemical nomenclature, codification, and spelling to improve the overall text as necessary and ma intain compliance with federal law. 5. The Department is amending R.61-62.70, Title V Operating Permit Program , by striking paragraph (a)(6) of Section 70.3, Applicability, to maintain state compliance with federal regulations. 6. The Department is amending R.61-62.96 to repeal the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) trading program regulations (Subparts AA through II, AAA through III, and AAAA through IIII) and reinstate applicable portions of the EPA's \"Finding of Significant Contribu tion and Rulemaking for Certain States in the Ozone Transport Assessment Group Region for Purposes of Reducing Regional Transport of Ozone\" (NO X SIP Call), with amendments as necessary, to maintain state compliance with federal regulations. The Department adopted R.61-62.97, Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) Trading Program , on August 25, 2017. Subparts AA through II, AAA through III, and AAA A through IIII of R.61-62.96 are based on the federal CAIR regulation, which EPA has since repl aced with federal CSAPR requirements implemented by R.61-62.97. As a result, federal CAIR requirements implemented by R.61-62.96 are no longer in effect. The reinstated NO X SIP Call regulations will maintain state compliance with federal NO X SIP Call requirements that remain applicable foll owing the sunsetting and repeal of CAIR. 7. The Department is making further changes to R.61- 62 deemed necessary, including, but not limited to, corrections or other changes for internal consistency, clarification, reference, punctuation, codification, formatting, spelling, and overall improvement of the text of R.61-62. 8. The Bureau held stakeholder meetings on Febr uary 6, 2018 (South Carolina Manufacturers Alliance annual meeting), February 15, 2018 (South Carolina Pu lp and Paper Association meeting), and March 2, 2018 (SC Chamber of Commerce Environmental/Technical Committee meeting). 9. The Department had a Notice of Draf ting published in the September 28, 2018, State Register . Notice was also published on the Department's Regulatory Information website in the DHEC Monthly Regulation Development Update . The Bureau sent a copy of the Notice of Drafting to interested stakeholders via Department email list on September 28, 2018. The Department received no public comments by the October 29, 2018, close of the public comment period. 10. Appropriate Department staff c onducted an internal review of th e proposed amendments on May 8, 2018. 11. The Department had a Notice of Proposed Re gulation published in the November 23, 2018, State Register. The Department received public comments by EPA Region 4 staff by the December 27, 2018, close of the public comment period. Based on these co mments, the Bureau has made a substantive change to the regulatory text published in the Notice of Proposed Regulation. Attachment B presents a summary of these public comments and Department responses. 12. South Carolina industries are already subject to these national air quality standards as a matter of federal law. Thus, there will be no increased cost to the state or its political subdivisions resulting from codification of these amendments to federal law. S outh Carolina is already reaping the environmental benefits of these amendments. There also will be no incr eased cost to the state or its political subdivisions as a result of the repeal of R.61-62.96 Subparts AA through II, AAA through III, and AAAA through IIII, which reflects the sunsetting of federal CAIR regulations. 13. In accordance with S.C. Code Section 1-23-120( H), legislative review is not required because the Department proposes promulgating the amendments to maintain compliance with federal law. As such, neither a preliminary assessment report nor a preliminary fiscal impact statement is required. 1 ATTACHMENT A STATE REGISTER NOTICE OF FINAL REGULATION FOR R. 61-62, Air Pollution Control Regulations and Standards January 3, 2019 Document No. 4870 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROL CHAPTER 61 Statutory Authority: 1976 Code Sections 48-1-10 et seq. 61-62.

(ii) For a CAIR NO X allowance allocation under Section 96.141(b), the allowances will be determined using the unit's baseline heat input equal to the unit's single highest adjusted control period heat input for the years that are five, six, seven, and ei ght years before the first year of the control periods for which the CAIR NO X annual allowance allocation is being calcu lated with the adjusted control period heat input for each year calculated as follows: (A) If the unit is coal-fired during the year, the unit's control period heat input for such year is multiplied by 1.0 (100 percent); or 50 (B) If the unit is not subject to paragra ph (a)(1)(ii)(A) of this section, the unit's control period heat input for such year is multiplied by 0.60 (60 percent). (2) A unit's control period heat input, and a unit's status as coal-fired, for a calendar year under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, and a unit's total tons of NO X emissions during a calendar year under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, will be determined in accordance with 40 CFR 75, to the extent the unit was otherwise subject to the requirements of 40 CFR 75 for the year, or will be based on the best available data reported to the Department for the unit, to the extent the uni t was not otherwise subject to the requirements of 40 CFR 75 for the year. Heat input data under 40 CF R 75 will be obtained from the Administrator. (b) (1) For each control period in 2009 and thereafter, the Depart ment will allocate to all CAIR NO X units in the State that have a baseline heat input (as determined under paragraph (a) of this section) a total amount of CAIR NO X allowances equal 97 percent for a control of the tons of NO X emissions in the State trading budget under Section 96.140 (except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section). (2) The Department will allocate CAIR NO X allowances to each CAIR NO X unit under paragraph (b)(1) of this section in an amount determined by multiplying the total amount of CAIR NO X allowances allocated under paragraph (b)(1) of this section by th e ratio of the baseline heat input of such CAIR NO X unit to the total amount of baseline heat input of all such CAIR NO X units in the State and rounding to the nearest whole allowance as appropriate. (c) New Unit Set-aside: For each control period in 2009 and ther eafter, the Department will allocate CAIR NO X allowances to CAIR NO X units in the State that are not allocated CAIR NO X allowances under paragraph (b) of this section because the units do not ye t have a baseline heat input under paragraph (a) of this section or because the units have a baseline heat input but all CAIR NO X allowances available under paragraph (b) of this section for the control period are already allocated, in acco rdance with the following procedures: (1) The Department will establish a separate new unit set-aside for each control period. Each new unit set-aside will be allocated CAIR NO X allowances equal three percent fo r a control period of the amount of tons of NO X emissions in the State trading budget under Section 96.140. (2) The CAIR designated representative of such a CAIR NO X unit may submit to the Department a request, in a format specified by th e Department, to be allocated CAIR NO X allowances, starting with the later of the control period in 2009 or the first contro l period after the control period in which the CAIR NO X unit commences commercial operation and until the first c ontrol period for which the unit is allocated CAIR NO X allowances under paragraph (b) of this section. A separate CAIR NO X allowance allocation request for each control period for which CAIR NO X allowances are sought must be submitted on or before May 1 of such control period. (3) In a CAIR NO X allowance allocation request under para graph (c)(2) of this section, the CAIR designated representative may request for a control period CAIR NO X allowances in an amount not exceeding the CAIR NO X unit's total tons of NO X emissions during the calendar year immediately before such control period in accordance with Subpart HH of this regulation. (4) The Department will review each CAIR NO X allowance allocation request under paragraph (c)(2) of this section and will allocate CAIR NO X allowances for each control period pursuant to such request as follows: (i) The Department will accept an allowance allocation request only if the request meets, or is adjusted by the Department as necessary to meet, the requirements of paragraphs (c)(2) and (3) of this 51 section. (ii) On or after May 1 of the control peri od, the Department will determine the sum of the CAIR NO X allowances requested (as adjusted under paragr aph (c)(4)(i) of this section) in all allowance allocation requests accepted under paragraph (c)(4 )(i) of this section for the control period. (iii) If the amount of CAIR NO X allowances in the new unit set-aside for the control period is greater than or equal to the sum under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, then the Department will allocate the amount of CAIR NO X allowances requested (as adjusted under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section) to each CAIR NO X unit covered by an allowance allo cation request accepted under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section. (iv) If the amount of CAIR NO X allowances in the new unit set-aside for the control period is less than the sum under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, then the Department will allocate to each CAIR NO X unit covered by an allowance allocation request accepted under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section the amount of the CAIR NO X allowances requested (as adjusted under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section), multiplied by the amount of CAIR NO X allowances in the new unit set-a side for the control period, divided by the sum determined under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, and rounded to the nearest whole allowance as appropriate. (v) The Department will notify each CAIR designated representative that submitted an allowance allocation request of the amount of CAIR NO X allowances (if any) a llocated for the control period to the CAIR NO X unit covered by the request. (d) If, after completion of the procedures under paragr aph (c)(4) of this section for a control period, any unallocated CAIR NO X allowances remain in the new unit set-aside for the control period, the Department will allocate to each CAIR NO X unit that was allocated CAIR NO X allowances under paragraph (b) of this section an amount of CAIR NO X allowances equal to the total amount of such remaining unallocated CAIR NO X allowances, multiplied by the unit's allocation under pa ragraph (b) of this section, divided 97 percent for a control period the amount of tons of NO X emissions in the State trading budget under Section 96.140, and rounded to the nearest whole allowance as appropriate. Section 96.143 Compliance Supplement Pool. (a) In addition to the CAIR NO X allowances allocated under Section 96 .142, the Department may allocate for the control period in 2009 up to 2,600 tons of CAIR NO X allowances to CAIR NO X units in the State. These allowances are referred to as the Compliance Supplement Pool. (b) For any CAIR NO X unit in the State that achieves NO X emission reductions in 2007 and 2008 that are not necessary to comply with any state or federal emi ssions limitation applicable during such years, the CAIR designated representative of the unit may requ est early reduction credits, and allocation of CAIR NO X allowances from the compliance supplement pool unde r paragraph (a) of this section for such early reduction credits, in accordance with the following: (1) The owners and operators of such CAIR NO X units shall monitor and report the NO X emissions rate and the heat input of the unit in accordance with Part 96 subpart HH of this regulation in each control period for which early reduction credit is requested. (2) The CAIR designated representative of such CAIR NO X unit shall submit to the Department by May 1, 2009, a request, in a format specified by the Department, for allocation of an amount of CAIR NO X allowances from the compliance supplement pool not exceeding the sum of the amounts (in tons) of the unit's NO X emission reductions in 2007 and 20 08 that are not necessary to comply with any state or federal 52 emissions limitation applicable during such years, de termined in accordance with Part 96 Subpart HH of this regulation. (c) For any CAIR NO X unit in the State whose compliance with the CAIR NO X emissions limitation for the control period in 2009 would create an undue risk to the reliability of electricity supply during such control period, the CAIR designated representative of the unit may request the allocation of CAIR NO X allowances from the compliance supplement pool under paragraph (a) of this section, in accord ance with the following: (1) The CAIR designated representative of such CAIR NO X unit shall submit to the Department by May 1, 2009, a request, in a format specified by th e Department, for allocation of an amount of CAIR NO X allowances from the compliance supplement pool not exceeding the minimum amount of CAIR NO X allowances necessary to remove such undue risk to the reliability of electricity supply. (2) In the request under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the CAIR designated representative of such CAIR NO X unit shall demonstrate that, in the absence of allocation to the unit of the amount of CAIR NO X allowances requested, the unit's compliance with the CAIR NO X emissions limitation for the control period in 2009 would create an undue risk to the reliability of electricity supply during such control period. This demonstration must include a showing that it would not be feasible for the owners and operators of the unit to: (i) Obtain a sufficient amount of electric ity from other electricity generation facilities, during the installation of control technology at the unit for compliance with the CAIR NO X emissions limitation, to prevent such undue risk; or (ii) Obtain under paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section, or otherwise obtain, a sufficient amount of CAIR NO X allowances to prevent such undue risk. (d) The Department will review each request under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section submitted by May 1, 2009, and will allocate CAIR NO X allowances for the control period in 2009 to CAIR NO X units in the State and covered by such request as follows: (1) Upon receipt of each such request, the Depa rtment will make any necessary adjustments to the request to ensure that the amount of the CAIR NO X allowances requested meets the requirements of paragraph (b) or (c) of this section. (2) If the State's compliance supplement pool under paragraph (a) of this section has an amount of CAIR NO X allowances not less than the total amount of CAIR NO X allowances in all such requests (as adjusted under paragraph (d)(1) of this section) , the Department will allocate to each CAIR NO X unit covered by such requests the amount of CAIR NO X allowances requested (as adjusted under paragraph (d)(1) of this section). (3) If the State's compliance supplement pool unde r paragraph (a) of this section has a smaller amount of CAIR NO X allowances than the total amount of CAIR NO X allowances in all such requests (as adjusted under paragraph (d)(1) of this sec tion), the Department will allocate CAIR NO X allowances to each CAIR NO X unit covered by such request s according to the following formula and rounding to the nearest whole allowance as appropriate: Unit's allocation = Unit's adjusted allocation \u00d7 (State's compliance supplement pool \u00f7 Total adjusted allocations for all units) Where: 53 \"Unit's allocation\" is the amount of CAIR NO X allowances allocated to the unit from the State's compliance supplement pool. \"Unit's adjusted allocation\" is the amount of CAIR NO X allowances requested for the unit under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, as adjusted under paragraph (d)(1) of this section. \"State's compliance supplement pool\" is the amount of CAIR NO X allowances in the State's compliance supplement pool. \"Total adjusted allocations for all units\" is the sum of the amounts of allocations requested for all units under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, as ad justed under paragraph (d)(1) of this section. (4) By November 30, 2009, the Department will determine, and submit to the Administrator, the allocations under paragraph (d)(2 ) or (3) of this section. (5) By January 1, 2010, the Administrator will r ecord the allocations under paragraph (d)(4) of this section.

(ii) For a CAIR NO X Ozone Season allowance allocation under Section 96.341(a)(2), the allowances will be determined using the unit's baseline h eat input equal to the unit's single highest adjusted control period heat input for the year s that are five, six, seven, and eight years before the first year of the control period for which the CAIR NO X Ozone Season allowance allocati on is being calculated with the adjusted control period heat input for each year calculated as follows: (A) If the unit is coal-fired during the year, the unit's control period heat input for such year is multiplied by 1.0 (100 percent); or (B) If the unit is not subject to paragra ph (a)(1)(ii)(A) of this section, the unit's control period heat input for such year is multiplied by 0.60 (60 percent). (2) A unit's control period heat input, and a unit's status as coal-fired, for a calendar year under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this secti on, and a unit's total tons of NO X emissions during a control period in a calendar year under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, w ill be determined in accordance with 40 CFR 75, to the extent the unit was otherwise subject to the require ments of 40 CFR 75 for the year, or will be based on the best available data reported to the Department fo r the unit, to the extent the unit was not otherwise subject to the requirements of 40 CFR 75 for the y ear. Heat input data under 40 CFR 75 will be obtained from the Administrator. (b) (1) For each control period in 2009 and thereafter, the Depart ment will allocate to all CAIR NO X Ozone Season units in the State that have a baseline h eat input (as determined under paragraph (a) of this section) a total amount of CAIR NO X Ozone Season allowances equal to 97 percent of the tons of NO X emissions in the State EGU trading budget for a c ontrol period under Section 96.340 (except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section). (2) The Department will allocate CAIR NO X Ozone Season allowances to each CAIR NO X Ozone Season unit under paragraph (b)(1) of this section in an amount determined by multiplying the total amount of CAIR NO X Ozone Season allowances allocat ed under paragraph (b)(1) of this section by the ratio of the baseline heat input of such CAIR NO X Ozone Season unit to the total amount of baseline heat input of all such CAIR NO X Ozone Season units in the State and rounding to the nearest whole allowance as appropriate. (3) CAIR NO X allocations for the 2009 ozone season can be used for the excess penalty deductions for the 2008 control period of the NO X SIP Call Trading Program that this Regulation replaced on April 30, 2009. 63 (c) EGU New Unit Set-aside - For each control period in 2009 and th ereafter, the Department will allocate CAIR NO X Ozone Season allowances to CAIR NO X Ozone Season units in the State that are not allocated CAIR NO X Ozone Season allowances under pa ragraph (b) of this section because the units do not yet have a baseline heat input under paragraph (a) of this secti on or because the units have a baseline heat input, but all CAIR NO X Ozone Season allowances available under paragrap h (b) of this section for the control period are already allocated, in accordan ce with the following procedures: (1) The Department will establish a separate new unit set-aside for each control period. Each new unit set-aside will be allocated CAIR NO X Ozone Season allowances equal to 3 percent for a control period of the amount of tons of NO X emissions in the State EGU trading budget under Section 96.340(a). (2) The CAIR designated representative of such a CAIR NO X Ozone Season unit may submit to the Department a request, in a format specified by the Department, to be allocated CAIR NO X Ozone Season allowances, starting with the latter of the control peri od in 2009 or the first cont rol period after the control period in which the CAIR NO X Ozone Season unit commences commerc ial operation and until the first control period for which the unit is allocated CAIR NO X Ozone Season allowances under paragraph (b) of this section. A separate CAIR NO X Ozone Season allowance allocation request for each control period for which CAIR NO X Ozone Season allowances are sought must be submitted on or before February 1 before such control period and after the date on which the CAIR NO X Ozone Season unit commences commercial operation. (3) In a CAIR NO X Ozone Season allowance allocation re quest under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the CAIR designated representative may request for a control period CAIR NO X Ozone Season allowances in an amount not exceeding the CAIR NO X Ozone Season unit's total tons of NO X emissions, in accordance with Subpart HHHH of th is regulation, during the control period immediately before such control period.

(iii) If the amount of CAIR NO X Ozone Season allowances in the new unit set-aside for the control period is greater than or equal to the su m under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, then the Department will allocate the amount of CAIR NO X Ozone Season allowances requested (as adjusted under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section) to each CAIR NO X Ozone Season unit covered by an allowance allocation request accepted under para graph (c)(4)(i) of this section. (iv) If the amount of CAIR NO X Ozone Season allowances in the new unit set-aside for the control period is less than the sum under paragraph (c )(4)(ii) of this section, then the Department will allocate to each CAIR NO X Ozone Season unit covered by an allo wance allocation request accepted under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section the amount of the CAIR NO X Ozone Season allowances requested (as adjusted under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section), multiplied by the amount of CAIR NO X Ozone Season 64 allowances in the new unit set-aside for the control pe riod, divided by the sum determined under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, and rounded to the nearest whole allowance as appropriate. (v) The Department will notify each CAIR designated representative that submitted an allowance allocation request of the amount of CAIR NO X Ozone Season allowances (if any) allocated for the control period to the CAIR NO X Ozone Season unit covered by the request. (d) If, after completion of the procedures under paragr aph (c)(4) of this section for a control period, any unallocated CAIR NO X Ozone Season allowances remain in the ne w unit set-aside for the control period, the Department will allo cate to each CAIR NO X Ozone Season unit that was allocated CAIR NO X Ozone Season allowances under paragraph (b) of this section an amount of CAIR NO X Ozone Season allowances equal to the total amount of such remaining unallocated CAIR NO X Ozone Season allowances, multiplied by the unit's allocation under paragraph (b) of this sec tion, divided by 97 percent for a control period of the amount of tons of NO X emissions in the State EGU trading budget under Section 96.340, and rounded to the nearest whole allowance as appropriate. (e) The baseline heat input (in mmBtu ) used with respect to CAIR NO X Ozone Season allowance allocations for non-EGUs for each CAIR NO X Ozone Season unit under Section 96.341(b) will be: (1) For a CAIR NO X Ozone Season allowance allocation under Section 96.341(b)(1), the allowances will be determined as follows: (i) For the control period for the years 2009, 2010 and 2011, the allocations will be determined using the unit's baseline heat input equal to the average of the two highest amounts of the unit's heat input for the control period in the years 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, and 2003, or, if a unit only operated during one of these control periods, the heat input during the single year of operation. (ii) For the control period for 2012, the a llocations will be determined using the unit's baseline heat input equal to the unit's single highest adjusted control period heat input for the years in 2004 and 2005. (2) For a CAIR NO X Ozone Season allowance allocation under Section 96.341(b)(2), the allowances will be determined using the unit's baseline h eat input equal to the unit's single highest adjusted control period heat input for the year s that are five, six, seven, and eight years before the first year of the control periods for which the CAIR NO X Ozone Season allowance allocation is being calculated. (3) The unit's total heat input fo r the control period in each year specified under paragraph (e) will be determined in accordance with 40 CFR 75 to the exte nt the unit was otherwise subject to the requirements of 40 CFR 75 for the year, or will be based on the best available data reported to the Department for the unit, to the extent the unit was not otherwise subject to the requirements of 40 CFR 75 for the year. Heat input data under 40 CFR 75 will be obtained from the Administrator.

Purpose: The EPA promulgated amendm ents to national air quality sta ndards in 2017. The recent federal amendments include clarification, guidance, and t echnical revisions to SIP requirements promulgated pursuant to 42 U.S.C. Sections 7410 and 7413; New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) mandated by 42 U.S.C. Section 7411; federal National Emissi on Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) mandated by 42 U.S.C. Section 7412; and federa l National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) for Source Categories mandated by 42 U.S.C. Section 7412. The Department, therefore, amends the aforementioned regulations and SIP to codify federal amendments to these standards promulgated from January 1, 2017, through December 31, 2017. Additio nally, the Department amends R.61-62.96 to repeal the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) trading program regulations (Subparts AA through II, AAA through III, and AAAA through IIII) and reinstate applicable portions of the EPA's \"Finding of Significant Contribution and Rulemaking fo r Certain States in the Ozone Transport Assessment Group Region for Purposes of Reduci ng Regional Transport of Ozone\" (NO X SIP Call), with amendments as necessary, to maintain state compliance with fede ral regulations. The Department also corrects R.61- 62.68 for internal consistency, clarification, chemi cal nomenclature, codification, and spelling to improve the overall text as necessary. Legal Authority: 1976 Code Sections 48-1-10 et seq ., and the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. Sections 7410, 7413, and 7416. Plan for Implementation: The amendments will take effect upon approval by the South Carolina Board of Health and Environmental Control an d publication in the State Register. These requirements are in place at the federal level and are currently being implemented. The amendmen ts will be implemented in South Carolina by providing the regulated community with copies of the regulation, publishing associated information on the Department's website at h ttp://www.scdhec.gov/Agency/RegulationsAndUpdates/, sending an email to stakeholders, and communicating with affected f acilities during the permitting process. DETERMINATION OF NEED AND REASONABLENESS OF THE REGULATION BASED ON ALL FACTORS HEREIN AND EXPECTED BENEFITS: The EPA promulgates amendments to its air quality regulations throughout each calendar year. Federal amendments in 2017 included revised NSPS rules, N ESHAPs, and NESHAPs for Source Categories. States are mandated by law to adopt these federal amendments . These amendments are reasonable as they promote consistency and ensure compliance with both state and federal regulations. The amendments also serve to repeal a regulation that is no longer in force, based on the sunsetting of federal CAIR requirements, and reinstate a regulation required by federal law. The amendments also include corrections for internal consistency, clarification, chemical nomenclature, codification, and spe lling to improve the overall text as necessary to ensure compliance with federal law. DETERMINATION OF COSTS AND BENEFITS: There is no anticipated increase in costs to the state or its political subdivisions resulting from these revisions. The standards to be adopted are already in effect and applicable to the regulated community as a matter of federal law, thus the amendments do not present a new cost to th e regulated community. The amendments incorporate the revisions to the EPA re gulations, which the Depart ment implements pursuant to the authority granted by Section 48-1-50 of the Po llution Control Act. The amendments will benefit the regulated community by clarifying and updating the regulations and increasing their ease of use. 69 UNCERTAINTIES OF ESTIMATES: There are no uncertainties of estimates relative to th e costs to the state or its political subdivisions. EFFECT ON THE ENVIRONMENT AND PUBLIC HEALTH: Adoption of the recent changes in federal regulatio ns through the amendments to R.61-62 will provide continued protection of the environment and public h ealth. Changes to R.61-62.96 have no detrimental effect on the environment and public health because th e federal rule, the Clean Air Interstate Rule, has sunsetted and is superseded by the Cross-St ate Air Pollution Rule and the reinstated NO X SIP Call. South Carolina's R.61-62.97, Cross-State Air Pollution Ru le (CSAPR) Trading Program, is already state- effective. DETRIMENTAL EFFECT ON THE ENVIRONMENT AND PUBLIC HEALTH IF THE REGULATION IS NOT IMPLEMENTED: The state's authority to implement federal requirement s, which are beneficial to the public health and environment, would be compromised if these ame ndments were not adopted in South Carolina. ATTACHMENT B SUMMARY OF PUBLIC COMMENTS AND DEPARTMENT RESPONSES Document No. 4870 R.61-62, Air Pollution Control Regulations and Standards As of the December 27, 2018, close of the Noti ce of Proposed Regulation comment period: NAME SECTION CITATION PUBLIC COMMENT DEPARTMENT RESPONSE U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Region 4 Regulation 61- 62.96.70 The EPA's proposal [ sic] rulemaking, Emissions Monitoring Provisions in State Implementation Plans Required Under the NO X SIP Call , has not yet been finalized. Therefore, it is premature to speculate the Agency's final policy position or whether the proposed regulatory changes at 40 CFR 51.121 will be finalized, allowing for alternative monitoring flexibilities. .... Based on the EPA's review of South Carolina's recent proposed language, the EPA believes it is too early to consider language at Regulation 61-62.96.70 (at subpart H) that incorporates the proposed additional monitoring flexibilities at 40 CFR 51.121 provided in the September 29, 2018 proposed rulemaking. The EPA cannot fully advise air agencies currently on the best, practical way to revise their SIPs to account for any proposed flexibilities at 40 CFR 51.121 when a final Agency position has not yet been determined. For these reasons, the EPA suggests South Carolina consider removing the recent proposed language referencing federally-enforceable permits or 40 CFR 51.121 at Regulation 61-62.96.70 and instead require units subject to the NO X SIP call to comply with 40 CFR Part 75, Subpart H monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting requirements. The Department understands that alternative monitoring flexibilities contemplated under the referenced proposed EPA rulemaking have not been finalized, and that Part 75 monitoring requirements currently continue to apply under 40 CFR 51.121. Consistent with this status quo, the regulatory text adopted requires all affected NO X SIP Call sources to continue Part 75 monitoring as currently required by 40 CFR 51.121. However, the regulatory text also specifies the alternative monitoring available to affected units if proposed federal regulatory changes at 40 CFR 51.121 are finalized. This contingent monitoring flexibility assures continuous compliance with federal law while also avoiding unnecessary delay, facilitating a smooth transition, and minimizing burdens on affected stakeholders 2 and the Department. In the event the EPA's proposed regulation is not finalized, the regulatory text as adopted will continue to require Part 75 monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Region 4 Regulation 61- 62.96.70 The EPA notes, however, that if the rulemaking were finalized as proposed, the State's proposed regulatory language does not appear to comport with the potential federal regulatory requirements. In particular, the State's phrase \"or as otherwise allowed under 40 CFR 51.121\" at the proposed Regulation 61-62.96.70 suggests that the alternative monitoring the State would require in lieu of part 75 monitoring would not go through the SIP approval process because 40 CFR 51.121, as proposed, would not specifically define what is \"otherwise allowed,\" if indeed the Agency finalizes changes to the NO X SIP Call regulations. The EPA believes that approval of alternative monitoring should involve a revision to the SIP that specifically sets out the air agency's intended alternative monitoring requirements rather than a non- regulatory process. The regulated industry would look to the proposed language at Regulation 61-62.96.70 and see no clear obligation to also cross-reference the non-regulatory provisions of the SIP to determine what monitoring and recordkeeping requirements are appropriate. It is important that the regulated industry can clearly identify what is required with respect to monitoring of their NO X mass emissions. The proposed language \"or as otherwise allowed under 40 CFR 51.121\" provides for a general requirement to monitor, instead of specifically revising the SIP to provide for monitoring meeting the regulatory requirements. Additionally, the EPA To address EPA's concern, the Department has amended the regulatory language in the proposed revisions at R.61-62.96.70 to include specific monitoring requirements for units that may be eligible for alternative monitoring if the proposed federal regulatory changes at 40 CFR 51.121 are promulgated. Specifically, affected units subject to 40 CFR Part 60, Subpart D or Subpart Db may, if not otherwise required to monitor and report under Part 75, monitor and report NO X emissions in accordance with Subpart D or Subpart Db, as applicable. If the federal regulatory changes at 40 CFR 51.121 are not promulgated, the proposed revisions at R. 61-62.96.70 will require the affected units to continue to meet the monitoring requirements as currently required under 40 CFR Part 75. 3 notes the proposed language \"as otherwise allowed under 40 CFR 51.121 and the federally enforceable permit applicable to the unit \" (emphasis added) could be read to suggest the permit conditions control the applicable required monitoring without requiring SIP approval and review by the EPA. This would be generally inconsistent with the requirements at 51.121(i) which requires the State's implementation plan revision to provide for monitoring the status of compliance with control measures adopted to meet the NO X SIP Call budgets, including legally enforceable procedures for monitoring and reporting emissions data from the regulated sources. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Region 4 Regulation 61- 62.96.40 The EPA recommends South Carolina consider measures that ensure large electricity generating unties [ sic] (EGUs) and non-EGUs covered by the NO X SIP Call do not exceed the enforceable NO X emission caps proposed for approval into the SC SIP at [R.61-]62-96.40. The EPA is available for further discussion with the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control respecting such measures. Historical emission data and potential to emit data for South Carolina's NO X SIP Call EGUs and large non-EGUs support continued compliance with the NO X SIP Call budgets over the long term. Compliance with the specified budgets is further supported through those monitoring and reporting requirements set forth in the regulation. Additionally, permit(s) for each facility will be updated to include a NO X SIP Call condition reflecting the requirements of the regulation. STATE REGISTER NOTICE OF PROPOSED REGULATION FOR REGULATION 61 -62, Air Pollution Control Regulations and Standards January 3, 2019 Document No. _____ DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROL CHAPTER 61 Statutory Authority: 1976 Code Section s 48-1-10 et seq. 61-62. Air Pollution Control Regulations and Standards . Preamble: Pursuant to the federal Clean Air Act (\"CAA\"), 42 U.S.C. Sections 7401 et seq., and the South Carolina Pollution Control Act, 1976 Code Section s 48-1-10 et seq., the South Carolina Department of Health and Environment al Control (\"Department\") proposes amending South Carolina Regulation 61 -62, Air Pollution Control Regulations and Standards , and the State Implementation Plan (\"SIP\"), as follows: 1. R.61-62.1, Definitions and General Requirements, Section II, Permit Req uirements, to expand and improve consistency in language regarding general and registration permits. 2. The introductory paragraph to R.61-62.5, Standard No. 2, Ambient Air Quality Standards, to remove the sentence describing the test method for Gaseous F luorides to improve the accuracy and clarity of the regulation's text. 3. R.61-62.5, Standard No. 5.2, Control of Oxides of Nitrogen (NO X), to update applicability and exemptions, as well as to propose corrections for internal consistency, punctuation, codification, and spelling. 4. R.61-62.5, Standard No. 7, Prevention of Significant Deterioration, to update applicability and exemptions, as well as to propose corrections for consistency with federal regulations, internal consistency, punctuation, codif ication, and spelling. 5. R.61-62.5, Standard No. 7.1, Nonattainment New Source Review (NSR), to improve the overall clarity and structure of the regulation, as well as to propose corrections for consistency with federal regulations, internal consistency, punctuation, codification, and spelling. 6. R.61-62.1, Definitions and General Requirements; R.61-62.5, Standard No. 7, Prevention of Significant Deterioration; R .61-62.5, Standard No. 7.1, Nonattainment New Source Review (NSR) ; and R .61-62.70 Title V Operating Permit Program, to update public participation procedures. 7. The Department also proposes other changes to R.61-62, Air Pollution Control Regulations and Standards, including definitional updates, clarification of certain permitting provisions, and other changes and additions deemed necessary, as well as corrections for internal consistency, clarification, reference, punctuation, codification, formatting, and spelling to improve the overall text of R.61-62 as necessary. The Department does not anticipate an increase in costs to the state or its political subdivisions resulting from these proposed revisions. These changes streamline existing state requirements, ensure consistency with federal law, and improve the overall organizational structure and clarity of the Department's regulations. South Carolina industries are already subject to national air quality standards as a matter of federal law. The proposed amendments will benefit the regulated community by maintaining state implementation of federal requirements, as opposed to federal implementation. In accordance with S.C. Code Section 1 -23-120(A) (Supp. 2017 ), these amendments require General Assembly review. The Department had a Notice of Drafting published in the October 27, 2017, State Register and a Notice of Proposed Regulation (Document No. 4815) published in the June 22, 2018, State Register . The Department originally scheduled a public hearing for September 13, 2018; however, inclement weather -related government closures pushed the public hearing to a rescheduled date (while complying with the S.C. Code Section 1 -23-110(A)(3)(b) 30 -day notice requirement for public hearings) outside of the one year statutory deadline to submit amendments for General Assembly review. As such , the Department has recommenced the regulatory promulgation process for the proposed amendments with a second Notice of Drafting , published November 23, 2018 , to supersede the original Notice of Drafting and t his Notice of Proposed Regulation to supersede the original Notice of Proposed Regulation (Document No. 4815 ).

Statement of Need and Reasonableness : This Statement of Need and Reasonableness was determined by staff analysis pursuant to 1976 Code Sections 1 -23-115(C)(1) -(3) and (9) -(11). DESCRIPTION OF REGULATION: Amendment of Regulation 61 -62, Air Pollution Control Regulations and Standards , and the S outh Carolina State Implementation Plan (\"SIP\"). Purpose: The proposed amendments to Regulation 61-62, Air Pollution Control Regulations and Standards, support the Department's goal of promoting and protecting the health of the public and the environment in a more efficient and effective manner. These amendments expand and clarify definitions applicable to air pollution control regulations and standards; streamline permitting options; clarify reporting requirements; identify the Department's consistent noticing method; improve the regulations' organizational structure; and provide corrections for consistency, clarification, reference, punctuation, codification, formatting, and spelling to improve the overall text of Regulation 61 -62. Legal Authority: 1976 Code Sections 48 -1-10 et seq. Plan for Implementation: The DHEC Regulation Development Update (accessible at http://www.scdhec.gov/Agency/RegulationsAndUpdates/RegulationDevelopmentUpdate/) provides a summary of and link to this proposed amendment. Additionally, printed copies are available for a fee from the Department's Freedom of Information Office. Upon taking legal effect, Department personnel will take appropriate steps to inform the regulated community of the amendment and any associated information. DETERMINATION OF NEED AND REASONABLENESS OF THE PROPOSED REGULATION BASED ON ALL FACTORS HEREIN AND EXPECTED BENEFITS: (1) The Department proposes amending R.61-62.1, Definitions and General Requirements, Section II, Permit Requirements, to expand and improve consistency in language regarding general and registration permits. (2) The Department proposes amending the introductory paragraph to R.61-62.5, Standard No. 2, Ambient Air Quality Standards, to remove the sentence describing the test method for Gaseous Fluorides to improve the accuracy and clarity of the regulation's text. (3) The Department proposes amending R.61-62.5, Standard No. 5.2, Control of Oxides of Nitrogen (NOx ), to update applicability and exemptions, as well as to propose corrections for internal consistency, punctuation, codification, and spelling. (4) The Department proposes amending R.61-62.5, Standard No. 7, Prevention of Significant Deterioration, to update applicability and exemptions, as well as to propose corrections for consistency with federal regulations, internal consistency, punctuation, codification, and spelling. (5) The Department proposes amending R.61-62.5, Standard No. 7.1, Nonattainment New Source Review (NSR), to improve the overall clarity and structure of the regulation, as well as to propose corrections for consistency with federal regulations, internal consistency, punctuation, codification, and spelling. (6) The Department proposes amending R.61-62.1, Definitions and General Requirements; Regulation 61-62.5, Standard No. 7, Prevention of Significant Deterioration; R.61-62.5, Standard No. 7.1, Nonattainment New Source Review (NSR) ; and R .61-62.70, Title V Operating Permit Program, to update public participation procedures. The Department also propose s other changes to R.61-62, Air Pollution Control Regulations and Standards, including definitional updates, clarification of certain permitting provisions, and other changes and additions deemed necessary, as well as corrections for internal consistency, clarification, reference, punctuation, codification, formatting, and spelling to improve the overall text of R.61-62. In accordance with S.C. Code Section 1-23-120(A) (Supp. 2017 ), these amendments require General Assembly review. The intent of these amendments is to simplify, clarify, and correct elements of the Department's air quality regulations to support the Department's goal of promoting and protecting the health of the public and the environment in a more efficient and effective manner. There would be no detrimental effect on the environment or public health if the proposed amendments to R . 61-62 and the SIP are adopted. DETERMINATION OF COSTS AND BENEFITS: The Department does not anticipate an increase in costs to the state , its political subdivisions , or the regulated community resulting from these proposed revisions. The proposed amendments ensure consistency with Environmental Protection Agency (\" EPA \") regulations, which th e Department implements pursuant to the authority granted by Section 48 -1-50 of the Pollution Control Act. The proposed amendments will benefit the regulated community by maintaining state implementation of the federal requirements, as opposed to federal implementation. Amendments to Regulation 61 -62, Air Pollution Control Regulations and Standards, and the SIP , will help streamline state requirements related to permitting and other matters to conform to current Prevention of Significant Deterioration, Ne w Source Review, and the Title V Permit Program standards. These revisions may potentially save money for the regulated community by providing clarification on exemptions , permitting , and other requirements, while continuing to e nsure environmental protec tion. UNCERTAINTIES OF ESTIMATES: There are no uncertainties of estimates relative to the costs to the state or its political subdivisions. These revisions seek to provide clarity to the regulated community. EFFECT ON ENVIRONMENT AND PUBLIC HEALTH: The amendments to Regulation 61 -62, Air Pollution Control Regulations and Standards, seek to provide continued state -focused protection of the environment and public health. DETRIMENTAL EFFECT ON THE ENVIRONMENT AND PUBLIC HEALTH IF THE REGULATION IS NOT IM PLEMENTED: The Department does not anticipate detrimental effect on the environment and/or public health associated with these revisions. To the contrary, the state's delegated authority to implement programs beneficial to public health and the environme nt may be compromised if these amendments are not adopted. Permit streamlining and regulatory text clarification seek to have a positive effect on both the environment and public health. Statement of Rationale: The Department proposes amending Regulation 61 -62, Air Pollution Control Regulations and Standards, to support the goal of promoting and protecting the health of the public and the environment in a more efficient and effective manner. These amendments expand and clarify definitions appli cable to air pollution control regulations and standards; streamline permitting options; clarify reporting requirements; identify the Department's consistent noticing method; improve the regulations' organizational structure; and provide corrections for co nsistency, clarification, reference, punctuation, codification, formatting, and spelling to improve the overall text of Regulation 61 -62.

The written report shall include, at a minimum, the following: i.(i) The identity of the stack and/or emission point where t he excess emissions occurred; ii.(ii) The magnitude of the excess emissions expressed in the units of the applicable emission limitation and the operating data and calculations used in determining the excess emissions; iii.(iii) The time and durati on of the excess emissions; iv.(iv) The identity of the equipment causing the excess emissions; v.(v) The nature and cause of such excess emissions; vi.(vi) The steps taken to remedy the malfunction and the steps taken or planned to prevent the recurrence of such malfunction; vii.(vii) The steps taken to limit the excess emissions; and viii.(viii) Documentation that the air pollution control equipment , process equipment, or processes were at all times maintained and operated, to the maximum extent practicable, in a manner consistent with good practice for minimizing emissions. d.(d) Sources required to have continuous emission monitors shall submit reports as specified in applicable parts of the permit, law, regulations, or standards. e.(e) Any owner or operator who constructs or operates a source or modification not in accordance with the application submitted pursuant to this regulation or with the terms of any approval to construct, or who commences construction after the effective date of these regulations without applying for and receiving approval hereunder, shall be subject to enforcement action. f.(f) Approval to construct shall become i nvalid if construction is not commenced within eighteen (18) months after receipt of such approval, if construction is discontinued for a period of eighteen (18) months or more, or if construction is not completed within a reasonable time. The Department m ay extend the 18-month period upon a satisfactory showing that an extension is justified. This provision does not apply to the time period between construction of the approved phases of a phased construction project; each phase must commence construction w ithin eighteen (18) months of the projected and approved commencement date. g.(g) A copy of the Department issued construction and/or operating permit must be kept readily available at the facility at all times. The owner or operator shall maintain such operational records; make reports; install, use, and maintain monitoring equipment or methods; sample and analyze emissions or discharges in accordance with prescribed methods at locations, intervals, and procedures as the Department shall prescribe; and provide such other information as the Department reasonably may require. All records required to demonstrate compliance with the limits established under a permit shall be maintained on site for a period of at least five (5) years from the date the record was generated. 2.(2) Special Permit Conditions As the Department finds appropriate, permits shall include special permit conditions such as, but not limited to, production limits, operational limits, source performance testing, operation and maintenanc e requirements, notification requirements, recordkeeping requirements, reporting requirements, and other monitoring as required. a.(a) When special permit conditions contain production or operational limits, the permit shall have monitoring and/or recor dkeeping requirements to verify a source's compliance with the limitations. b.(b) When special permit conditions require an add -on air pollution control device to be operated at a specified destruction and removal efficiency level, the permit shall have monitoring and recordkeeping requirements to determine the add -on air pollution control device's performance on a short -term basis. c.(c) The time period over which a permit limitation on production or operation extends will be as short as possible. For the purpose of determining compliance, permit limitations will, in general, not exceed one (1) month and shall not exceed an annual limit w ith a rolling monthly average or sum. d.(d) An owner or operator of stationary sources that desires or is required to conduct performance tests to verify emissions limitations shall ensure that source tests are conducted in accordance with the provision s of Regulation 61 -62.1, Section IV, Source Tests. e.(e) An hourly emission limit shall be sufficient only if the permit condition(s) require the installation, calibration, maintenance, and operation of a CEMS or any other monitoring approved by the Department. All monitoring data shall be defined and recorded for showing compliance with the emission limit(s). f.(f) The limitations and requirements listed in the permit conditions shall be permanent, quantifiable, or otherwise enforceable as a practical matter. K.(K) Exceptions 1.(1) Upon request, the Depar tment may alter operating permits, compliance schedules, or other restrictions on operation of a source provided that resulting ambient air concentration levels will not exceed any national or state ambient air quality standard. Factors to be considered by the Department may include, but are not limited to, technology, economics, national energy policy, and existing air quality. The request by the source must also show the following: a.(a) Good faith efforts have been made to comply with the state requir ements; b.(b) The source is unable to comply with the state requirements because the necessary technology or other alternative methods of control are not reasonably available or have not been available for a sufficient period of time; c.(c) Any avail able operating procedures or control measures reducing the impact of the source on ambient air concentrations have been implemented; and d.(d) The request is submitted in a timely manner. 2.(2) The provisions of this paragraph shall not apply to mass emission limits which are imposed upon any source by the following requirements: a.(a) Federal New Source Performance Standards (NSPS); b.(b) National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP); c.(c) Federal or State Prevention of S ignificant Deterioration (PSD) Regulations; or d.(d) Nonattainment requirements. 3.(3) Where a permanent increase in the visible emission limitation for a source is requested, the source must demonstrate that it will remain in compliance with the appl icable particulate emission standard. 4.(4) Any alternative compliance schedule shall provide for compliance with the applicable regulations as expeditiously as practicable based on a plan submitted with the request for the alternative compliance schedule. 5.(5) Any request under this section wil l be subjected to public notice and opportunity for a public hearing. Upon approval by the Board, the recommendations of this Department shall be sent to the Administrator, or his designated representative, for approval or disapproval. 6.(6) Where altern ative compliance schedule provisions are contained elsewhere in the air pollution control regulations, those provisions shall supersede the requirements in this section. L.(L) Emergency Provisions 1.(1) An \"emergency\" means any situation arising from su dden and reasonably unforeseeable events beyond the control of the source, including acts of God, in which a situation requires immediate corrective action to restore normal operation, and that causes the source to exceed a technology -based emission limita tion under the permit due to unavoidable increases in emissions attributable to the emergency. An emergency shall not include noncompliance to the extent caused by improperly designed equipment, lack of preventative maintenance, careless or improper operat ion, or operator error. 2.(2) An emergency may be documented through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs and other relevant evidence that verify: a.(a) An emergency occurred and the owner or operator can identify the cause(s) of the emerge ncy; b.(b) The permitted source was, at the time the emergency occurred, being properly operated; c.(c) During the period of the emergency, the owner or operator took all reasonable steps to minimize levels of emissions that exceeded the emission sta ndards or other requirements in the permit; and d.(d) The owner or operator gave a verbal notification of the emergency to the Department within twenty -four (24) hours of the time when emission limitations were exceeded, followed by a written report within thirty (30) days.

M.(M) Transfer of Ownership/Operation Within thirty (30) days of the transfer of ownership/operation of a facility, the current permit holder and prospective new owner/operator shall submit to the Department a written request for transfer of the source operating or construction permit(s). The written request for transfer of the source operating or construction permit(s) shall include any changes pertaining to the facility name; the name, mailing address, and telephone number of the owner or operator for the facility; and any proposed changes to the permitted activities of the source. Transfer of the operating or construction permit(s) will be effective upon written approval by the Department. N.(N) Public Participation Procedures 1.(1) When determined to be appropriate by the Department (or specified by regulation), notice of permitting activity shall be provided to the public and other entities for their review and comment. Public notice shall be given by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the area where the source is located, or by posting on to a public website identified by the Department 's website , or by publication in the South Carolina State Register, and to persons on a mailing list developed by the Department, including those who request in writing to be on the list. The Department may use other additional means of public notice , including, but not limited to public meetings . 2.(2) The notice shall include the following: a.(a) The name and physical address o f the facility; b.(b) The name and address of the Department; c.(c) Applicable activities involved in the permit action; d.(d) Applicable emission change involved in any permit modification; e.(e) The name, address, and telephone number of a pe rson from whom interested persons may obtain additional information, including copies of the permit draft, the application, and all other materials available to the Department that are relevant to the permit decision, except for information entitled to con fidential treatment (the contents of any proposed or draft permit shall not be treated as confidential information); f.(f) A brief description of the comment procedures; and g.(g) The time and place of any public hearing that may be held, including a statement of procedures to request a hearing (unless a hearing has already been scheduled). 3.(3) The Department shall provide at least thirty (30) days for public and EPA comment and shall give notice of any public hearing at least thirty (30) days in advance of the hearing. a.(a) The Department shall keep a record of the commenters and the comments made during the public comment period. b.(b) The Department shall consider all written comments submitted within a time specified in the notice of public comment and all comments received at any public hearing(s) in making a final decision on the approvability of the application. 4.(4) A newly con structed or modified source issued a federally enforceable final construction permit will not require an additional public comment period and/or hearing to obtain an operating permit, unless the source proposes a change in the original construction and/or operational plan, prior to commencing construction, which the Department determines would require an additional public comment period and/or hearing. 5.(5) Any proposed new or modified stationary source required to undergo a public comment period shall not commence any construction until all public participation procedures of this section are completed, and the source has received an effective construction p ermit from the Department. 6.(6) Maintenance activities, repairs, and replacements which the Department determines to be routine for that source category shall not, by themselves, be required to undergo the public participation procedures of Section II . N(N). O.(O) Inspection and Entry Upon presentation of credentials and other documents as may be required by law, the owner or operator shall allow the Department or an authorized representative to perform the following: 1.(1) Enter the facility where emissions -related activity is conducted, or where records must be kept under the conditions of the permit; 2.(2) Have access to and copy, at reasonable times, any records that must be kept under the conditions of the permit; 3.(3) Inspect any facilitie s, equipment (including monitoring and air pollution control equipment), practices, or operations regulated or required under this permit; and 4.(4) As authorized by the Clean Air Act and/or the South Carolina Pollution Control Act, sample or monitor, at reasonable times, substances or parameters for the purpose of assuring compliance with the permit or applicable requirements. SECTION III - EMISSIONS INVENTORY AND EMISSIONS STATEMENTS A.(A) General 1.(1) An emissions inventory is a study or compilati on of pollutant emissions. The purposes of emissions inventories are to locate air pollution sources, to define the type and size of sources, to define the type and amount of emissions from each source, to determine pollutant frequency and duration, to det ermine the relative contributions to air pollution from classes of sources and of individual sources, to provide a basis for air permit fees, and to determine the adequacy of regulations and standards. The requirements of this section notwithstanding, an e missions inventory may be required from any source at any time. 2.(2) An emissions statement is a less detailed statement which focuses on emissions estimates for pollutants associated with a nonattainment designation. B.(B) Emissions Inventory Reporting Requirements 1.(1) Beginning with the effective date of this regulation, sources must submit an emissions inventory for the previous calendar year by March 31 at a frequency as outlined below: a.(a) Type A Sources are Title V Sources with annual emissions greater than or equal to any of the emission thresholds listed for Type A Sources in Table 1 below. Type A Sources must submit an emissions inventory every year. Table 1 - Minimum Point Source Repo rting Thresholds by Pollutant (tons per year) Pollutants Type A Sources: Annual Cycle Potential1 or Actual2 SO X 2500 Potential VOC 250 Potential NO X 2500 Potential CO 2500 Potential Pb 0.502 Actual PM 10 250 Potential Table 1 - Minimum Point Source Repo rting Thresholds by Pollutant (tons per year) Pollutants Type A Sources: Annual Cycle Potential1 or Actual2 PM 2.5 250 Potential NH 3 250 Potential 1 Tons per year (tpy) potential to emit means the maximum capacity of a stationary source to emit any air pollutant under its physical and operational design. Any physical or operational limitation on the capacity of a source to emit an air pollutant, including air pollution control equipment and restrictions on hours of operation or on the type or amount of material combusted, stored, or processed, will be treated as part of its design if the limitation is enforceable by the Administrato r and included in the source's permit prior to the end of the reporting year . 2 The EPA considers that the ambient monitoring rule threshold is 0.5 tons of actual emissions; therefore, this criterion is based on actual emissions rather than the potential -to-emit approach taken for other criteria pollutant and precursor thresholds. b.(b) All other Title V Sources with annual emissions less than the emission thresholds listed for Type A Sources in Table 1 above must submit emissions inventories every three (3) years beginning with calendar year 2014 data. c.(c) Nonattainment area (NAA) Sources are sources located in a NAA with annual emissions during any year of the three (3) year cycle greater than or equal to any of the emission thresholds listed for NAA Sources in Table 2 below. These sources that are not also Type A Sources must subm it emissions inventories every three (3) years beginning with calendar year 2014 data. Table 2 - Minimum Point Source Reporting Thresholds by Pollutant (tons per year) Pollutant NAA3 Sources: Three -year Cycle Potential1 or Actual2 SO X 100 Potential VOC 100 (moderate O 3 NAA ) Potential 50 (serious O 3 NAA) 25 (severe O 3 NAA) 10 (extreme O 3 NAA) NO X 100 (all O 3 NAA) Potential CO 100 (all O 3 NAA) Potential 100 (all CO NAA) Pb 0.50 Actual PM 10 100 (moderate PM 10 NAA) Potential 70 (serious PM 10 NAA) PM 2.5 100 Potential NH 3 100 Potential 1 Tons per year (tpy) potential to emit means the maximum capacity of a stationary source to emit any air pollutant under its physical and operational design. Any physical or operational limitation on the capacity of a source to emit an air pollutant, including air pollution control equipment and restrictions on hours of operation or on the type or amount of material combusted, stored, or processed, will be treated as part of its design if the limitation is enforceable by the Administrator and included in the source's permit prior to the end of the reporting year . 2 The EPA considers that the ambient monitoring rule threshold is 0.5 tons of actual emissions; therefore, this criterion is based on actual emissions rather than the potential -to-emit approach taken for other criteria pollutant and precursor thresholds. 3 Special point source reporting thresholds apply for certain pollutants by type of NAA. The pollutants by nonattainment area are: Ozone: VOC, NO X, and CO; Carbon Monoxide: CO; and Particulate matter less than 10 microns: PM 10. 2.(2) Other Requirements a.(a) Unless otherwise indicated, all emissions inventories must be submitted to the Department by March 31 following the year of inventory. All applicable information must be recorded in the current format for reporting emissions data provided by the Department. b.(b) All newly permitted and constructed Title V Sources which have obtained or are in the process of obtainin g a Title V permit and all newly permitted and constructed NAA Sources must complete and submit to the Department an initial emissions inventory for the source's first partial calendar year of operation and an emissions inventory for the source's first ful l calendar year of operation. i.(i) The partial year emissions inventory must be submitted to the Department no later than March 31 of the year following the source's partial year of operation and must include an emissions inventory from the source's o peration start date through December 31 of the same year. ii.(ii) The first full calendar year emissions inventory must be submitted to the Department by March 31 of the year following the source's first calendar year of operation. iii.(iii) Sources must submit future emissions inventories on the schedule as described in paragraph B.1.a (B)(1)(a) , paragraph B.1.b of this section. c.(c) Any existing sources that are determined by the Department to be su bject to Regulation 61 -62.70, Title V Operating Permit Program, and/or NAA Sources must complete and submit to the Department an emissions inventory for the previous calendar year within ninety (90) days. These sources must then submit future emissions inv entories on the schedule as described in paragraph paragraph B.1.b this section. d.(d) Submittal of emissions inventories outside of the schedules in this section will be accepted and reviewed on ly if a modification has occurred that required issuance of an air quality permit since the last emissions inventory submittal by the source. This modification must alter the quantity or character of the source's emissions. These sources may submit a new e missions inventory following the first full calendar year of operation after the modification. These sources must then submit future emissions inventories on the schedule described in paragraph B.1.a (B)(1)(a) , paragraph B.1.b of this section. e.(e) Information required in an emissions inventory submittal to the Department must include the following: i.(i) Information on fuel burning equipment; ii.(ii) Types process materials and quantities used; vii.(vii) Design, normal, and actual process rates; viii.(viii) Hours of operation; ix.(ix) Significant emission gen erating points or processes as discussed in the current format for reporting emissions data provided by the Department; x.(x) Any desired information listed in 40 CFR Part 51 Subpart A (December 17, 2008) that is requested by the Department; xi.(xi) Emissions data from all regulated pollutants; and xii.(xii) Any additional information reasonably related to determining if emissions from an air source are causing standards of air quality to be exceeded. f.(f) A source may submit a written request to the Department for approval of an alternate method for estimating emissions outside of those methods prescribed by the Department. Such requests will be reviewed by the Department's emissions inventory staff on a case -by-case basis to determine if the a lternate method better characterizes actual emissions for the reporting period than the Department's prescribed methods. g.(g) Emission estimates from insignificant activities listed on a source's permit are required only in the initial emissions invent ory submitted by the source. If emissions from these insignificant activities have not been included in a past emissions inventory submitted to the Department, the source must include these emissions in their next required emissions inventory submittal. h.(h) Copies of all records and reports relating to emissions inventories as required in this section must be retained by the owner/operator at the source for a minimum of five (5) years. C.(C) Emissions Statement Requirements 1.(1) Sources in areas designated nonattainment for an ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) must submit to the Department by March 31 for the previous calendar year an emissions statement which includes emissions estimates for both VOCs and nitro gen oxides (NO X) beginning with the effective date of this regulation. 2.(2) The statement must contain a certification that the information contained in the statement is accurate to the best knowledge of the individual certifying the statement. 3.(3) All applicable information must be recorded in the current format for reporting emissions data provided by the Department. 4.(4) Copies of all records and reports relating to emissions statements as required in this section must be retained by the owner or operator at the source for a minimum of five (5) years. SECTION IV - SOURCE TESTS A.(A) Applicability 1.(1) This section shall apply to the owner, operator, or representative of any source which conducts: a.(a) A source test required under an app licable standard or permit condition; or pursuant to a judicial or administrative order, consent agreement, or any other such binding requirement entered into after the effective date of this standard; or b.(b) Any other source test from which data will be submitted to the Department for any purpose including but not limited to: determination of applicability of regulatory requirements, development of emission factors, establishment of parameters for compliance assurance monitoring, continuous emission monitor performance specification testing, and Relative Accuracy Test Audits (RATA). 2.(2) The Department may, on a case -by-case basis, exempt from the requirements of this section source tests which are performed for development of emission factors or fo r determination of applicability of regulations. B.(B) Submission and Approval of a Site -Specific Test Plan 1.(1) Prior to conducting a source test subject to this section, the owner, operator, or representative shall ensure that: a.(a) A written site -specific test plan, including all of the information required in Section IV .

Submission of a site-specific test plan or amendments to a previously approved test plan does not constitute notification. Requirements for a complete notification include the following: a.(a) Facility name, permit number, mailing address, physical address, and contact name and phone number; b.(b) Source(s) being tested, source identification number(s), and pollutant(s) being tested; c.(c) Proposed test date and start time for each source being tested; and d.(d) Approved test plan being used to conduct the test identified by Department approval date. 2.(2) In the event the owner, operator, or representative is unable to conduct the source test on the date specified in the notification, the owner, operator, or representative shall notify the Department as soon as practical by telephone and follow up in writing within thirty (30) days. Telephone notification shall include a description of the circumstance(s) causing t he cancellation of the test, and a projected retest date. The written follow -up report shall include a description of the condition(s) which prevented the source test from being conducted, and when applicable, what corrective action was performed, or what equipment repairs were required. 3.(3) Rescheduling of canceled source tests must meet the two -week notice requirement. However, shorter notification periods may be allowed subject to Department approval. 4.(4) All tests shall be conducted by or under the direction of a person qualified by training and/or experience in the field of air pollution testing or, where required by federal regulation, meeting the minimum competency requirements for air emissions testing as specified in ASTM D7036 -04, Standard Practice for Competence of Air Emission Testing Bodies. 5.(5) Unless approved otherwise by the Department, the owner, operator, or representative shall ensure that source tests are conducted while the source is operating at the maximum expected productio n rate or other production rate or operating parameter which would result in the highest emissions for the pollutants being tested or as otherwise specified in a relevant federal or state requirement . Examples of the operating parameters that may affect em ission rates are: type and composition of raw materials and fuels, isolation of control equipment modules, product types and dimensions, thermal oxidizer combustion temperature, atypical control equipment settings, etc. Some sources may have to spike fuels or raw materials to avoid being permitted at a more restrictive feed or process rate. Any source test performed at a production rate less than the rated capacity may result in permit limits on emission rates, including limits on production if necessary. 6.(6) When conducting a source test subject to this section, the owner, operator, or representative of a source shall provide the following: a.(a) Department access to the facility to observe source tests; b.(b) Sampling ports adequate for test methods; c.(c) Safe sampling site(s); d.(d) Safe access to sampling site(s); e.(e) Utilities for sampling and testing equipment; and f.(f) Equipment and supplies necessary for safe testing of a source. E.(E) Source Test Method Performance Audit Program 1.(1) The Department may request that samples collected during any source tests be split with the Department for analysis by an independent or Department laboratory. Any request for split samples will be made i n advance of the source test. 2.(2) Performance testing shall include a test method performance audit (PA) during the performance test if a PA sample is commercially available. a.(a) PAs consist of blind audit samples supplied by an accredited audit s ample provider (AASP) and analyzed during the performance test in order to provide a measure of test data bias. b.(b) An \"accredited audit sample provider (AASP)\" is an organization that has been accredited to prepare audit samples by an independent, th ird party accrediting body. 3.(3) The source owner, operator, or representative of the tested facility shall obtain an audit sample, if commercially available, from an AASP for each test method used for regulatory compliance purposes. a.(a) No audit s amples are required for the following test methods: Methods 3A and 3C of Appendix A-2 of 40 CFR Part 60; Methods 6C, 7E, 9, and 10 of Appendix A -4 of 40 CFR Part 60; Method 18 of Appendix A -6 of 40 CFR Part 60; Methods 20, 22, and 25A of Appendix A -7 of 40 CFR Part 60; and Methods 303, 318, 320, and 321 of Appendix A of 40 CFR Part 63. b.(b) If multiple sources at a single facility are tested during a compliance test event, only one audit sample is required for each method used during a compliance test. c.(c) Upon request, the Department may waive the requirement to include an audit sample if the Department determines that an audit sample is not necessary. A waiver of the performance audit requirements to conduct a PA for a particular source does not constitut e a waiver of performance audit requirements for future source tests. d.(d) \"Commercially available\" means that two or more independent AASPs have blind audit samples available for purchase. If the source owner, operator, or representative cannot find a n audit sample for a specific method, the owner, operator, or representative shall consult the EPA Web site at the following URL, http://www.epa.gov/ttn/emc, to confirm whether there is an AASP that can supply an audit sample for that method. e.(e) If the EPA Web site does not list an available audit sample at least 60 days prior to the beginning of the compliance test, the source owner, operator, or representative shall not be required to include an audit sample as part of the quality assurance program for the compliance test. f.(f) When ordering an audit sample, the source, operator, or representative shall give the AASP an estimate for the concentration of each pollutant that is emitted by the source or the estimated concentration of each pollutant based on the permitted level and the name, address, and phone number of the Department. g.(g) The source owner, operator, or representative shall report the results for the audit sample along with a summary of the emission test results for the audited p ollutant to the Department and shall report the results of the audit sample to the AASP. The source owner, operator, or representative shall make both reports at the same time and in the same manner or shall report to the Department first and then report t o the AASP. h.(h) If the method being audited is a method that allows the samples to be analyzed in the field and the tester plans to analyze the samples in the field, the tester may analyze the audit samples prior to collecting the emission samples pro vided a representative of the Department is present at the testing site. The source owner, operator, or representative may request in the test protocol a waiver to the requirement that a representative of the Department must be present at the testing site during the field analysis of an audit sample. i.(i) The final test report shall document any attempt to obtain an audit sample and, if an audit sample was ordered and utilized, the pass/fail results as applicable. 4.(4) The Department shall have discretion to require any subsequent remedial actions of the owner, operator, or representative based on the split samples and/or performance audit results. F.(F) Final Source Test Report 1.(1) The owner, operator, or represen tative of a source subject to this section shall submit a written report of the final source test results to the Department by the close of business on the 30th day following the completion of the test, unless an alternative date has been requested in and approved with the site-specific test plan prior to testing or is otherwise specified in a relevant federal or state standard requirement . 2.(2) The final test report for each site -specific test plan shall contain, at a minimum, the following supporting i nformation when applicable: a.(a) Summary of the results; b.(b) Emission calculations and emission rates in units of the applicable standard, permit limit, etc.; c.(c) Allowable emission rates in units of the applicable standard, permit limit, etc .; d.(d) Source compliance status; e.(e) Process operating rates; f.(f) Methods including actual calculations, equations, and other related information that were used to demonstrate and verify the operating rate during the source test; g.(g) Chain of custody records; h.(h) Certification of all reference standards used; i.(i) Signature of a responsible facility representative who can verify process operating rates and parameters; j.(j) Legible copies of all raw laboratory data (for ex ample, filter tare and final weights, titrations, chromatograms, spectrograms, analyzer measurements, etc.); k.(k) Legible copies of all raw field data (for example, strip charts, field data forms, field calibration forms, etc.); l.(l) Legible copies of applicable stack gas or opacity monitoring system readings identified in the approved site -specific test plan; m.(m) Legible copies of all applicable process and air pollution control operating parameter readings identified in the approved site -specific test plan; n.(n) Results of all calibrations and QA/QC measures and checks identified in the approved site-specific test plan; o.(o) Results of performance audits pursuant to Section IV . E(E) above or documentation that no audit sample was comme rcially available 60 days prior to the beginning of the compliance test; p.(p) Description of any deviations from the proposed process operations as approved in the site-specific test plan during testing; q.(q) Description of any deviations from approved sampling methods/procedures; r.(r) Description of any deviations from approved analytical procedures; s.(s) Description of any problems encountered during sampling and analysis, and explanation of how each was resolved; and t.(t) Legible copies of any applicable or required certifications (for example, Visible Emission Observer, Qualified Source Testing Individual (QSTI), etc.).

H.(H) Analytical Observation Upon request by the Department, the owner, operator, representative, or the source test consultant shall ensure that Department representatives are provided access to the analytical laboratory for observation of instrument calibrations and analysis of field and audit samples. I.(I) Site Inspection Upon request by the Department and prior to approval of the site -specific test plan, the owner, operator, or represe ntative shall ensure Department representatives are provided access to the site for inspection of the source(s) to be tested. J.(J) Modifications Modifications to the approved site -specific test plan must have prior Department approval. Approval shall be considered on a case -by-case basis. Failure to obtain prior Department approval may cause final test results to be unacceptable. SECTION V - CREDIBLE EVIDENCE A.(A) The Department promulgated Regulation 61 -62, Air Pollution Control Regulations and Sta ndards , and developed the South Carolina Air Quality Implementation Plan to provide enforceable emission limitations; to establish an adequate enforcement program; to require owners or operators of stationary sources to monitor emissions, submit periodic reports of such emissions, and maintain records as specified by various regulations and permits; and to evaluate reports and records for consistency with the applicable emission limitation or standard on a continuing basis over time. The monitoring data co llected and records of operations would serve as the basis for a source to certify compliance, and could be used by the Department as direct evidence of an enforceable violation of the underlying emission limitation or standard. B.(B) The purpose of this section is: 1.(1) To clarify the statutory authority of Regulation 61 -62, Air Pollution Control Regulations and Standards , and the South Carolina Air Quality Implementation Plan , whereby non -reference test data and various kinds of information already av ailable and utilized for other purposes may be used to demonstrate compliance or noncompliance with emission standards; 2.(2) To eliminate any potential ambiguity regarding language that has been interpreted to provide for exclusive reliance on reference test methods as the means of certifying compliance with various emission limits; and 3.(3) To curtail language that limits the types of testing or monitoring data that may be used for determining compliance and for establishing violations. C.(C) The fo llowing are applicable in the determination of noncompliance by the Department or for compliance certification by the owners or operators of stationary sources: 1.(1) Enforcement - Consistent with South Carolina's Environmental Audit Privilege and Volunt ary Disclosure Act, codified as S.C. Code Ann. Sections 48 -57-10 et seq., and notwithstanding any other provision in the South Carolina Air Quality Implementation Plan , any credible evidence or information relevant to whether a source would have been in co mpliance with applicable requirements if the appropriate performance or compliance test had been performed, can be used to establish whether or not a person has violated or is in violation of any standard in the plan; and 2.(2) Compliance Certifications - Consistent with South Carolina's Environmental Audit Privilege and Voluntary Disclosure Act, codified as S.C. Code Ann. Sections 48 -57-10 et seq., and notwithstanding any other provision in the South Carolina Air Quality Implementation Plan , the owner or operator may use any credible evidence or information relevant to whether a source would have been in compliance with applicable requirements if the appropriate performance or compliance test had been performed for the purpose of submitting compliance cer tifications. 61-62.5. Standard No. 2. Ambient Air Quality Standards. The following table, unless otherwise noted, constitutes the primary and secondary ambient air quality standards for the State of South Carolina. The computations for determining if the applicable standard is met, along with the analytical methods to be us ed, will be those applicable Federal Reference Methods and Interpretations published in the Appendices to 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 50, or those methods designated as Federal Equivalent Methods (FEM) in accordance with 40 CFR Part 53. In the case of Gaseous Fluorides, either the double paper tape sampler method (ASTM D -3266 -91 or later), the sodium bicarbonate -coated glass tube and particulate filter method (ASTM D -3268 -91 or later), or an approved method may be used.

SECTION II - DEFINITIONS For the purposes of this regulation, the following definitions shall apply: A.(A) Annual Capacity Factor: Means the ratio between the actual heat input to a combustion unit from the fuels d uring a calendar year and the potential heat input to the steam generating unit had it been operated for 8,760 hours during a calendar year at the maximum steady state design heat input capacity. B.(B) Burner Assembly: Means any complete, pre -engineered device that combines air (or oxygen) and fuel in a controlled manner and admits this mixture into a combustion chamber in such a way as to ensure safe and efficient combustion. A self -contained chamber such as is found on a combustion turbine is not a burner assembly for the purposes of this regulation. C.(C) Case -by-Case NO X Control: Means an emissions limitation based on the maximum deg ree of reduction for NO X which would be emitted from any new source which the Department, on a case -by-case basis, taking into account energy, environmental, and economic impacts and other costs, determines is achievable for such source through application of production processes or available methods, systems, and techniques. In no event shall application of NO X control result in emissions of any pollutant which would exceed the emissions allowed by any applicable standard. If the Department determines that technological or economic limitations on the application of measurement methodology to a particular source would make the impositions of an emission standard infeasible, a design, equipment, work practice, operational standard, or combination thereof, may be prescribed instead to satisfy the requirement for the application of NO X control. Such standard shall, to the degree possible, set forth the emissions reduction achievable by implementation of such design, equipment, work practice or operation, and sha ll provide for compliance by means which achieve equivalent results. D.(D) Combustion Control Device: Means, but is not limited to, any equipment that is used to destroy or remove air pollutant(s) prior to discharge to the atmosphere, excluding boilers, p rocess heaters, dryers, furnaces, digesters, ovens, combustors, and similar combustion devices. Such equipment includes, but is not limited to, thermal oxidizers, catalytic oxidizers, and flares. E.(E) Constructed: Means the on -site fabrication, erection, or installation of the NO X emitting source. F.(F) Equivalent Technology: Means any item that is identical or functionally equivalent to the existing component. This component may serve the same purpose or function as the replaced component, but may be di fferent in some respects or improved in some ways. G.(G) Existing affected source: Means sources constructed on or before June 25, 2004 , and that meet the applicability requirements of Section (1)I(A)(2). H.(H) Fuel: Means the following fuels, any combination of the fuels or any combustible material the Department determines to be a fuel including, but not limited to: (1) Virgin fuel, waste, waste fuel, and clean wood (biomass fuel) as defined in Regulation 6 1-62.1. (2) Biodiesel: Means a mono -alkyl ester derived from vegetable oil and animal fat and conforming to ASTM D6751. (3) Biofuel: Means any biomass -based solid fuel that is not a solid waste. This includes, but is not limited to, animal manure, incl uding litter and other bedding materials; vegetative agricultural and silvicultural materials, such as logging residues (slash), nut and grain hulls and chaff (for example , almond, walnut, peanut, rice, and wheat), bagasse, orchard prunings, corn stalks, c offee bean hulls and grounds. (4) Digester gas: Means any gaseous by -product of wastewater treatment typically formed through the anaerobic decomposition of organic waste materials and composed principally of methane and CO 2. (5) Fossil Fuel: Means natural gas, petroleum, coal, and any form of solid, liquid, or gaseous fuel derived from such material for the purpose of creating useful heat. Petroleum for facilities constructed, reconstructed, or modified before May 4, 2011, mea ns crude oil or a fuel derived from crude oil, including, but not limited to, distillate oil and residual oil. For units constructed, reconstructed, or modified after May 3, 2011, petroleum means crude oil or a fuel derived from crude oil, including, but n ot limited to, distillate oil, residual oil, and petroleum coke.

I.(I) New affected source: Means any affected source which has been constructed after June 25, 2004 , or meets the applicability requirements of Section (1)I(A)(3). A new affected source will not be considered an existing affected source at burner assembly replacement under Section (1)I(A)(2). (J) Non -routine maintenance is an unforeseen failure of a single burner assembly in an existing affected source with multiple burner application forcing an unplanned replacement of the existing burner. J.(K) Source: Means an individual NO X emission unit. a stationary NO X emission unit, comprised of one or more burners. SECTION III - STANDARD REQUIREMENTS FOR NEW AFFECTE D SOURCES A.(A) Those affected sources as defined in Section I(A)(1) and (A)(3) above shall apply NO X controls to achieve the limitations provided in Table 1 of this section. Unless otherwise noted, all emission limits for affected sources required to use Continuous Emissions Monitoring (CEMS) shall be based on thirty (30) day rolling averages. B.(B) An affected source may request an alternate control limitation by submitting a demonstration that the alternate limitation is a Case -by-Case NO X Control as d efined in Section II above. C.(C) The Department reserves the right to request that the owner or operator submit additional information for those affected sources that request alternate control limitation in accordance with Section III(B) above.

(i)(a) The requirements of this regulation apply to the construction of any new major stationary source (as defined in par agraph (b)(B)(32)) or any project at an existing major stationary source in an area designated as attainment or unclassifiable under 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 81.341. (ii)(b) The requirements of paragraphs (j)(J) through (r)(R) apply to the construction of any new major stationary source or the major modification of any existing major stationary source, except as this section otherwise provides. (iii)(c) No new major stationary source or major modification to which the requir ements of paragraphs (j)(J) through (r)(R)(5) apply shall begin actual construction without a permit that states that the major stationary source or major modification will meet those requirements. The Department has authority to issue any such permit. (iv)(d) The requirements of the program will be applied in accordance with the principles set out in paragraphs (a)(2)(iv)(a) (A)(2)(d)(i) through (f)(A)(2)(d)(vi) . (a)(i) Except as otherwise provided s (a)(2)(v) and (vi) (A)(2)(e) , and consi stent with the definition of major modification contained in paragraph (b)(B)(30), a project is a major modification for a regulated New Source Review (NSR) pollutant if it causes two types of emissions increases - a significant emissions increase (as defined in paragraph (b)(B)(50)), and a significant net emissions increase (as de fined in paragraphs (b)(B)(34) and (b)(B)(49)). The project is not a major modification if it does not cause a significant emissions increase. If the project causes a significant emissions increase, then the project is a major modification only if it also results in a significant net emissions increase. (b)(ii) The procedure for calculating (before beginning actual construction) whether a significant emissions increase ( that is , the first step of the process) will occur depends upon the type of emission s units being modified, according to paragraphs (a)(2)(iv)(c) (A)(2)(d)(iii) through (f)(A)(2)(d)(vi) . The procedure for calculating (before beginning actual construction) whether a significant net emissions increase will occur at the major stationary sourc e (that is , the second step of the process) is contained in the definition in paragraph (b)(B)(34). Regardless of any such preconstruction projections, a major modification results if the project causes a significant emissions increase and a significant ne t emissions increase. (c)(iii) Actual -to-projected -actual applicability test for projects that only involve existing emissions units. A significant emissions increase of a regulated NSR pollutant is projected to occur if the sum of the difference between the projected actual emissions (as defined in paragraph (b)(B)(41)) and the baseline actual emissions (as defined in paragraphs (b)(4) (i)(B)(4)(a) and (ii)(B)(4)(b) ), for each existing emissions unit, equals or exceeds the significant amount for that pollutant (as defined in paragraph (b)(B)(49)). (d)(iv) Actual -to-potential test for projects that only involve construction of a new e missions unit(s). A significant emissions increase of a regulated NSR pollutant is projected to occur if the sum of the difference between the potential to emit (as defined in paragraph (b)(B)(37)) from each new emissions unit following completion of the p roject and the baseline actual emissions (as defined in paragraph (b)(4)(iii) (B)(4)(c) ) of these units before the project equals or exceeds the significant amount for that pollutant (as defined in paragraph (b)(B)(49)). (e)(v) [Reserved] (f)(vi) Hybrid test for projects that involve multiple types of emissions units. A significant emissions increase of a regulated NSR pollutant is projected to occur if the sum of the emissions increases for each emissions unit, using the method specified in paragraphs (a)(2)(iv)(c) (A)(2)(d)(iii) and (d)(A)(2)(d)(iv) as applicable with respect to each emissions unit, for each type of emissions unit equals or exceeds, the significant amount for that pollutant (as defined in paragraph (b)(B)(49)). (v)(e) For any major stationary source for a Plantwide Applicability Limitation (PAL) for a regulated NSR pollutant, the major stationary source shall comply with the requirements under paragraph (aa) Section (AA) . (b)(B) Definitions. For the purposes of this regulation: For the purposes of this regulation: (1)(i)(a) \"Actual emissions \" means the actual rate of emissions of a regulated NSR pollutant from an emissions unit, as determined in accordance with paragraphs (b)(1)(ii) (B)(1)(b) through (b)(1)(iv) (B)(1)(d) , except that this definition shall not apply for calculating whether a signi ficant emissions increase has occurred, or for establishing a PAL under paragraph (aa) Section (AA) . Instead, paragraphs (b)(B)(41) and (b)(B)(4) shall apply for those purposes. (ii)(b) In general, actual emissions as of a particular date shall equal th e average rate, in tons per year (tpy) , at which the unit actually emitted the pollutant during a consecutive twenty -four ( 24)-month period which precedes the particular date and which is representative of normal source operation. The Department shall allow the use of a different time period upon a determination that it is more representative of normal source operation. Actual emissions shall be calculated using the unit's actual operating hours, production rates, and types of materials processed, stored, or combusted during the selected time period. (iii)(c) The Department may presume that source -specific allowable emissions for the unit a re equivalent to the actual emissions of the unit. (iv)(d) For any emissions unit that has not begun normal operations on the particular date, actual emissions shall equal the potential to emit of the unit on that date. (2) \"Adverse impact on visibili ty\" means visibility impairment which interferes with the management, protection, preservation or enjoyment of the visitor's visual experience of the Class I area. This determination must be made on a case -by-case basis taking into account the geographic e xtent, intensity, duration, frequency and time of visibility impairment, and how these factors correlate with (1) times of visitor use of the Class I area, and (2) the frequency and timing of natural conditions that reduce visibility. (3) \"Allowable emis sions \" means the emissions rate of a stationary source calculated using the maximum rated capacity of the source (unless the source is subject to federally enforceable limits which restrict the operating rate, or hours of operation, or both) and the most s tringent of the following: (i)(a) The applicable standards as set forth in 40 CFR Parts 60 and 61; (ii)(b) The applicable State Implementation Plan emissions limitation, including those with a future compliance date; or (iii)(c) The emissions rate specified as a federally enforceable permit condition, including those with a future compliance date. (4) \"Baseline actual emissions \" means the rate of emissions, in tpy tons per year , of a regulated NSR pollutant, as determined in accordance with paragraphs (b)(4)(i) (B)(4)(a) through (iv)(B)(4)(d) . (i)(a) For any existing electric utility steam generating unit, baseline actual emissions means the average rate, in tpy tons per year , at which the unit actually emitted the pollutant during any consecutive twenty -four ( 24)-month period selected by the owner or operator within the five ( 5)-year period immediately preceding when the owner or operator begins actual construction of the proj ect. The Department shall allow the use of a different time period upon a determination that it is more representative of normal source operation. (a)(i) The average rate shall include fugitive emissions to the extent quantifiable, and emissions associ ated with startups, shutdowns, and malfunctions. (b)(ii) The average rate shall be adjusted downward to exclude any non -compliant emissions that occurred while the source was operating above any emission limitation that was legally enforceable during the consecutive twenty -four ( 24)-month period. (c)(iii) For a regulated NSR pollutant, when a project involves multiple emissions units, only one consecutive twenty -four ( 24)-month period must be used to determine the baseline actual emissions for the emissions units being changed. A different consecutive twenty -four ( 24)-month period can be used for each regulated NSR pollutant. (d)(iv) The average rate shall not be based on any consecutive twenty -four ( 24)-month period for which there is inadequate information for determining annual emissions, in tpy tons per year , and for adjusting this amount if required by paragraph (b)(4)(i)(b) (B)(4)(a)(ii) . (ii)(b) For an existing emissions unit (other than an electric utility steam generating unit), baseline actual emissions means the average rate, in tpy tons per year , at which the emissions unit actually emitted the pollutant during any consecutive twenty -four ( 24)-month period selected by the owner or operator within the ten (10)-year period immediately preceding either the date the owner or operator begins actual construction of the project, or the date a complete permit application is received by the Department for a permit required under this section or under a plan approved by the Administrator, whichever is earlier, except that the ten ( 10)-year period shall not include any period earlier than November 15, 1990. The Department reserves the right to determine if the twenty -four ( 24)-month period selected is appropriate.

(iv)(d) In general, the continuous air quality monitoring data that is required shall have been gathered over a period of at least one year and shall represent at le ast the year preceding receipt of the application, except that, if the Department determines that a complete and adequate analysis can be accomplished with monitoring data gathered over a period shorter than one (1) year (but not to be less than four (4) m onths), the data that is required shall have been gathered over at least that shorter period. (v)(e) For any application which becomes complete, except as to the requirements of paragraphs (m)(1)(iii) (M)(1)(c) and (iv)(M)(1)(d) , between June 8, 1981, and February 9, 1982, the data that paragraph (m)(1)(iii) (M)(1)(c) , requires shall have been gathered over at least the period from February 9, 1981, to the date the application becomes otherwise complete, except that: (a)(i) If the source or modification would have been major for that pollutant under 40 CFR 52.21 as in effect on June 19, 1978, any monitoring data shall have been gathered over at least the period required by those regulations. (b)(ii) If the Department det ermines that a complete and adequate analysis can be accomplished with monitoring data over a shorter period (not to be less than four (4) months), the data that paragraph (m)(1)(iii) (M)(1)(c) , requires shall have been gathered over at least that shorter p eriod. (c)(iii) If the monitoring data would relate exclusively to ozone and would not have been required under 40 CFR 52.21 as in effect on June 19, 1978, the Department may waive the otherwise applicable requirements of this paragraph (v)(M)(1)(e) to the extent that the applicant shows that the monitoring data would be unrepresentative of air quality over a full year. (vi)(f) The owner or operator of a proposed stationary source or modification of VOCs who satisfies all conditions of 40 CFR Part 51 Appendix S, Section IV may provide post -approval monitoring data for ozone in lieu of providing preconstruction data as required under paragraph (m)(M)(1).

(2) Pos t-construction monitoring. The owner or operator of a major stationary source or major modification shall, after construction of the stationary source or modification, conduct such ambient monitoring as the Department determines is necessary to determine t he effect emissions from the stationary source or modification may have, or are having, on air quality in any area. (3) Operations of monitoring stations. The owner or operator of a major stationary source or major modification shall meet the requirement s of Appendix B to 40 CFR Part 58 of during the operation of monitoring stations for purposes of satisfying paragraph (m)(M). (n)(N) Source information. The owner or operator of a proposed source or modification shall submit all information necessary to perform any analysis or make any determination required under this section. (1) With respect to a source or modification to which paragraphs (j)(J), (l)(L), (n)(N), and (p)(P) apply, such information shall include: (i)(a) A description of the nature, location, design capacity, and typical operating schedule of the source or modification, including specifications and drawings showing its design and plant layout; (ii)(b) A detailed schedule for construction of the source or modification; (iii)(c) A detailed description as to what system of continuous emission reduction is planned for the source or modification, emission estimates, and any other information necessary to determine that BACT would be applied. (2) Upon request of the Department, the owner or operator shall also provide information on: (i)(a) The air quality impact of the source or modification, including meteorological and topographical data necessary to estimate such impact; and (ii)(b) The air quality impacts, and the nature and extent of any or all general commercial, residential, industrial, and other growth which has occurred since August 7, 1977, in the area the source or modification would affect. (o)(O) Additional impact analyses.

The owner or operat or need not provide an analysis of the impact on vegetation having no significant commercial or recreational value. (2) The owner or operator shall provide an analysis of the air quality impact projected for the area as a result of general commercial, re sidential, industrial and other growth associated with the source or modification. (3) Visibility monitoring. The Department may require monitoring of visibility in any Class I area near the proposed new stationary source for major modification for such purposes and by such means as the Administrator deems necessary and appropriate. (p)(P) Sources impacting Federal Class I areas - additional requirements. (1) Notice to Federal Land Managers. The Department shall provide written notice of any permit application for a proposed major stationary source or major modification, the emissions from which may affect a Class I area, to the Federal Land Manager and the federal official charged with direct responsibility for management of any lands within any such area. Such notification shall include a copy of all information relevant to the permit application and shall be given within thirty (30) days of receipt and at least sixty ( 60) days prior to any public hearing on the application for a permit to construct. Such notification shall include an analysis of the proposed source's anticipated impacts on visibility in the Class I area. The Department shall also provide t he Federal Land Manager and such federal officials with a copy of the preliminary determination required under paragraph (q)(Q), and shall make available to them any materials used in making that determination, promptly after the Department makes such dete rmination. Finally, the Department shall also notify all affected Federal Land Managers within thirty (30) days of receipt of any advance notification of any such permit application. (2) Federal Land Manager. The Federal Land Manager and the federal offi cial charged with direct responsibility for management of such lands have an affirmative responsibility to protect the air quality related values (including visibility) of such lands and to consider, in consultation with the Department, whether a proposed source or modification will have an adverse impact on such values. (3) Visibility analysis. The Department shall consider any analysis performed by the Federal Land Manager, provided within thirty (30) days of the notification required by paragraph (p)(P)(1), that shows that a proposed new major stationary source or major modification may have an adverse impact on visibility in any Class I area. Where the Department finds that such an analysis does not demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Department tha t an adverse impact on visibility will result in the Federal Class I area, the Department must, in the notice of public hearing on the permit application, either explain its decision or give notice as to where the explanation can be obtained. (4) Denial - impact on air quality related values. The Federal Land Manager of any such lands may demonstrate to the Department that the emissions from a proposed source or modification would have an adverse impact on the air quality -related values (including visibili ty) of those lands, notwithstanding that the change in air quality resulting from emissions from such source or modification would not cause or contribute to concentrations which would exceed the maximum allowable increases for a Class I area. If the Depar tment concurs with such demonstration, then the permit shall not be issued. (5) Class I variances. The owner or operator of a proposed source or modification may demonstrate to the Federal Land Manager that the emissions from such source or modification would have no adverse impact on the air quality related values of any such lands (including visibility), notwithstanding that the change in air quality resulting from emissions from such source or modification would cause or contribute to concentrations wh ich would exceed the maximum allowable increases for a Class I area. If the Federal Land Manager concurs with such demonstration and so certifies, the state may authorize the Administrator : Provided, That , provided that the applicable requirements of this regulation are otherwise met, to issue the permit with such emission limitations as may be necessary to assure that emissions of sulfur dioxide, PM 2.5, PM 10, and nitrogen oxides would not exceed the following maximum allowable increases over minor source baseline concentration for such pollutants: Pollutant Maximum Allowable Increase (micrograms per cubic meter) PM 2.5: annual arithmetic mean 4 24-hr maximum 9 Pollutant Maximum Allowable Increase (micrograms per cubic meter) PM 10: annual arithmetic mean 17 24-hr maximum 30 Sulfur dioxide: annual arithmetic mean 20 24-hr maximum 91 3-hr maximum 325 Nitrogen dioxide: annual arithmetic mean 25 (6) Sulfur dioxide variance by Governor with Federal Land Manager's concurrence. The owner or operator of a proposed source or modification which cannot be approved under paragraph (q)(Q)(4) may demonstrate to the Governor that the source cannot be constructed by reason of any maximum allowable increase for sulfur dioxide for a period of twenty -four (24) hours or less applicable to any Class I area and, in the case of Federal mandatory Class I areas, that a variance under this clause would not advers ely affect the air quality related values of the area (including visibility). The Governor, after consideration of the Federal Land Manager's recommendation (if any) and concurrence, may, after notice and public hearing, grant a variance from such maximum allowable increase. If such variance is granted, the Department shall issue a permit to such source or modification pursuant to the requirements of paragraph (q)(Q)(7): Provided , provided that the applicable requirements of this regulation are otherwise me t. (7) Variance by the Governor with the President's concurrence. In any case where the Governor recommends a variance in which the Federal Land Manager does not concur, the recommendations of the Governor and the Federal Land Manager shall be transmitte d to the President. The President may approve the Governor's recommendation if it is found that the variance is in the national interest. If the variance is approved, the Department shall issue a permit pursuant to the requirements of paragraph (q)(Q)(7): Provided , provided that the applicable requirements of this regulation are otherwise met. (8) Emission limitations for Presidential or gubernatorial variance. In the case of a permit issued pursuant to paragraph (q)(Q)(5) or (q)(Q)(6) the source or modif ication shall comply with such emission limitations as may be necessary to assure that emissions of sulfur dioxide from the source or modification would not (during any day on which the otherwise applicable maximum allowable increases are exceeded) cause o r contribute to concentrations which would exceed the following maximum allowable increases over the baseline concentration and to assure that such emissions would not cause or contribute to concentrations which exceed the otherwise applicable maximum allo wable increases for periods of exposure of twenty -four (24) hours or less for more than eighteen (18) days, not necessarily consecutive, during any annual period: MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE INCREASE (Micrograms per cubic meter) Period of exposure Terrain Areas Low High 24-hr maximum 36 62 3-hr maximum 130 221 (q)(Q) Public participation. (1) Within thirty (30) days after receipt of an application to construct, or any addition to such application, the Department shall advise the applicant of any deficiency in the application or in the information submitted and transmit a copy of such applic ation to EPA. In the event of such a deficiency, the date of receipt of the application shall be, for the purpose of this regulation, the date on which the Department received all required information. (2) In accordance with Regulation 61 -30, Environment al Protection Fees , the Department shall make a final determination on the application. This involves performing the following actions in a timely manner: (i)(a) Make a preliminary determination whether construction should be approved, approved with conditions, or disapproved. (ii)(b) Make available in at least one location in each region in which the proposed source or modification would be constructed a copy of all materials the applicant submitted, a copy of the preliminary determination and a copy or summary of other materials, if any, considered in making the preliminary determination. This requirement may be met by making these materials available at a physical location or on a public website identified by the Department. (iii)(c) Notify the p ublic, by advertisement in a newspaper of general circulation in each region in which the proposed source or modification would be constructed, of the application, the preliminary determination, the degree of increment consumption that is expected from the source or modification, and the opportunity for comment at a public hearing as well as written public comment. Alternatively, these notifications may be made on a public website identified by the Department. However, the Department's selected notification method (i.e., either newspaper or website), known as the \"consistent noticing method,\" shall be used for all permits subject to notice under this section and may, when appropriate, be supplemented by other noticing methods on individual permits. If the De partment selects website notice as its consistent noticing method, the notice shall be available for the duration of the public comment period and shall include the notice of public comment, the draft permit, information on how to access the administrative record for the draft permit and how to request and/or attend a public hearing on the draft permit. posting the notice, for the duration of the public comment period, on a public website identified by the Department. This consistent noticing method shall be used for all draft permits subject to notice under this section. The public website notice shall include a notice of public comment including notice of the application, the preliminary determination, the degree of increment consumption that is expected from the source or modification, and the opportunity for comment at a public hearing as well as written public comment. The public website notice shall also include the draft permit, information on how to access the administrative record for the draft perm it and how to request and/or attend a public hearing on the draft permit. The Department may use additional means to provide adequate notice to the affected public, including by publishing the notice in a newspaper of general circulation in each region in which the proposed source or modification would be constructed (or in a state publication designed to give general public notice). (iv)(d) Send a copy of the notice of public comment to the applicant, the Administrator of EPA, and to officials and agenc ies having cognizance over the location where the proposed construction would occur as follows: The chief executives of the city and county where the source or modification would be located, any comprehensive regional land use planning agency and any state , Federal Land Manager, or Indian Governing Body whose lands may be affected by emissions from the source or modification. (v)(e) Provide opportunity for a public hearing for interested persons to appear and submit written or oral comments on the air qu ality impact of the source or modification, alternatives to the source or modification, the control technology required, and other appropriate considerations. (vi)(f) Consider all written comments submitted within a time specified in the notice of public comment and all comments received at any public hearing in making a final decision on the approvability of the application. No later than ten (10) days after the close of the public comment period, the applicant may submit a written response to any comments submitted by the public. The Department shall consider the applicant's response in making a final decision. The Department shall make all comments available for public inspection in the same location or on the same website where the Department made available preconstruction information relating to the proposed source or modification. (vii)(g) Make a final determination whether construction should be approved, appro ved with conditions, or disapproved pursuant to this section. (viii) (h) Notify the applicant in writing of the final determination and make such notification available for public inspection at the same location or on the same website where the Departmen t made available preconstruction information and public comments relating to the source or modification. (ix)(i) Notify EPA of every action related to the consideration of the permit. (3) The requirements of Section (q)(Q), Public Participation, of th is standard shall not apply to any major plant or major modification which Section (i)(I), Exemptions, would exempt from the requirements of Sections (k)(K), (m)(M), and (o)(O), but only to the extent that, with respect to each of the criteria for construc tion approval under the South Carolina State Implementation Plan and for exemption under Section (i)(I), requirements providing the public with at least as much participation in each material determination as those of Section (q)(Q) have been met in the granting of such construction approval. (r)(R) Source obligation. In addition to all other applicable requirements specified in this regulation, the owner or operator shall comply with the requirements of paragraphs (r)(R)(1) thro ugh (r)(R)(8). (1) Any owner or operator who constructs or operates a source or modification not in accordance with the application submitted pursuant to this section or with the terms of any approval to construct, or any owner or operator of a source or modification subject to this section who commences construction after the effective date of these regulations without applying for and receiving approval hereunder, shall be subject to appropriate enforcement action. (2) Approval to construct shall beco me invalid if construction is not commenced within eighteen (18) months after receipt of such approval, if construction is discontinued for a period of eighteen (18) months or more, or if construction is not completed within a reasonable time. The Departme nt may extend the eighteen ( 18)-month period upon a satisfactory showing that an extension is justified. This provision does not apply to the time period between construction of the approved phases of a phased construction project; each phase must commence construction within eighteen (18) months of the projected and approved commencement date. (3) Approval to construct shall not relieve any owner or operator of the responsibility to comply fully with applicable provisions of the State Implementation Plan and any other requirements under local, state, or federal law. (4) At such time that a particular source or modification becomes a major stationary source or major modification solely by virtue of a relaxation in any enforceable limitation which was est ablished after August 7, 1980, on the capacity of the source or modification otherwise to emit a pollutant, such as a restriction on hours of operation, then the requirements or paragraphs (j)(J) through (r)(R) shall apply to the source or modification as though construction had not yet commenced on the source or modification. (5) Reserved (6) Monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting. The provisions of this paragraph (r)(R)(6) apply to with respect to any regulated NSR pollutant emitted from projects at an existing emissions unit at a major stationary source (other than projects at a source with a PAL) in circumstances where there is a reasonable possibility that a project that is not a part of a major modification may result in a significant emissions increase and the owner or operator elects to use the method specified in paragraphs (b)(41)(ii)(a) (B)(41)(b)(i) through (c)(B)(41)(b)(iii) for calculating projected actual emissions. (i)(a) If the project requires construction permitting unde r Regulation 61 -62.1, Section II, \"Permit Requirements,\" the owner or operator shall provide a copy of the information set out in paragraph (r)(6)(ii) (R)(6)(b) as part of the permit application to the Department. If construction permitting under Regulation 61-62.1, Section II, \"Permit Requirements,\" is not required, the owner or operator shall maintain the information set out in paragraph (r)(6)(ii) (R)(6)(b) . (ii)(b) Before beginning actual construction of the project, the owner or operator shall document and maintain a record of the following information: (a)(i) A description of the project; (b)(ii) Identification of the emissions unit(s) whose emissions of a regulated NSR pollutant could be affected by the project; and (c)(iii) A description of the applicability test used to determine that the project is not a major modification for any regulated NSR pollutant, including the baseline actual emissions, the projected actual emissions, the amount of emissions excluded under paragraph (b)(41)(ii)(c) (B)(41)(b)(iii) and an explanation for why such amount was excluded, and any netting calculations, if applicable. (c) If the emissions unit is an existing electric utility steam generating unit, before beginning actual construction, the owner or operator shall provide a copy of the information set out in paragraph (R)(6)(b) of this section to the Department. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to re quire the owner or operator of such a unit to obtain any determination from the Department before beginning actual construction. (iii)(d) The owner or operator shall monitor the emissions of any regulated NSR pollutant that could increase as a result of the project and that is emitted by any emissions unit identified in paragraph (r)(6)(ii)(b) (R)(6)(b)(ii) ; and calculate and maintain a record of the annual emissions, in tpy tons per year on a calendar year basis, for a period of five (5) years following resumption of regular operations after the change, or for a period of ten (10) years following resumption of regular operations after the change if the project increases the design capacity of or potential to emit that regulated NSR pollutant at such emiss ions unit. (iv)(e) If the unit is an existing electric utility steam generating unit, the owner or operator shall submit a report to the Department within sixty ( 60) days after the end of each year during which records must be generated under paragraph (r)(6)(iii) (R)(6)(d) setting out the unit's annual emissions during the calendar year that preceded submission of the report. (v)(f) If the unit is an existing unit other than an electric utility steam generating unit, the owner or operator shall submit a report to the Department if the annual emissions, in tpy tons per year , from the project identified in paragraph (r)(6)(ii) (R)(6)(b) , exceed the baseline actual emissions (as documented and maintained pursuant to paragraph (r)(6)(ii)(c) (R)(6)(b)(iii) ), by a significant amount (as defined in paragraph (b)(B)(49)) for that regulated NSR pollutant, and if such emissions differ from the preconstruction projection as documented and maintained pursuant to paragraph (R)(6)(b)(iii) (r)(6)(ii)(c) . Such report shal l be submitted to the Department within sixty ( 60) days after the end of such year. The report shall contain the following: (a)(i) The name, address and telephone number of the major stationary source; (b)(ii) The annual emissions as calculated pur suant to paragraph (r)(6)(iii) (R)(6)(d) ; and (c)(iii) Any other information needed to make a compliance determination ( for example , an explanation as to why the emissions differ from the preconstruction projection). (g) A \"reasonable possibility\" under paragraph (R)(6) of this section occurs when the owner or operator calculates the project to result in either: (i) A projected actual emissions increase of at least fifty (50) percent of the amount that is a \"significant emissions increase,\" as d efined under paragraph (B)(50) of this section (without reference to the amount that is a significant net emissions increase), for the regulated NSR pollutant; or (ii) A projected actual emissions increase that, added to the amount of emissions excluded under paragraph (B)(41)(b)( iii) of this section, sums to at least fifty (50) percent of the amount that is a \"significant emissions increase,\" as defined under paragraph (B)(50) of this section (without reference to the amount that is a significan t net emissions increase), for the regulated NSR pollutant. For a project for which a reasonable possibility occurs only within the meaning of paragraph (R)(6)(g)( ii) of this section, and not also within the meaning of paragraph (R)(6)(g)( i) of this sectio n, then provisions (R)(6)(c) through (R)(6)(f) do not apply to the project. (7) If a project at a source with a PAL requires construction permitting under Regulation 61 -62.1, Section II, \"Permit Requirements\", the owner or operator shall provide notifica tion of source status as part of the permit application to the Department. (8) The owner or operator of the source shall make the information required to be documented and maintained pursuant to paragraph (r)(R)(6) available for review upon a request for inspection by the Department or the general public pursuant to the requirements contained in 40 CFR 70.4(b)(3)(viii). (s)(S) through (u)(U)(3) [Reserved] (u)(U)(4) In the case of a source or modification which proposes to construct in a Class III area, emissions from which would cause or contribute to air quality exceeding the maximum allowable increase applicable if the area were designated a Class II area, and where no standard under Section 111 of the Clean Air Act has been promulgated for such source category, the Administrator must approve the determination of BACT as set forth in the permit. (v)(V) Innovative control technology. (1) An owner or operator of a proposed major stationary source or major modification may request the Department in writ ing no later than the close of the comment period under 40 CFR 124.10 to approve a system of innovative control technology. (2) The Department shall, with the consent of the governor(s) of the affected state(s), determine that the source or modification may employ a system of innovative control technology, if: (i)(a) The proposed control system would not cause or contribute to an unreasonable risk to public health, welfare, or safety in its operation or function; (ii)(b) The owner or operator agrees to achieve a level of continuous emissions reduction equivalent to that which would have been required under paragraph (j)(J)(2), by a date specified by the Department. Such date shall not be later than four (4) years from the time of startup or seven (7) years from permit issuance; (iii)(c) The source or modification would meet the requirements of paragraphs (j)(J) and (k)(K), based on the emissions rate that the stationary source employing the system of innovative control technology would be required to meet on the date specified by the Department; (iv)(d) The source or modification would not before the date specified by the Department: (a)(i) Cause or contribute to a violation of an applicable National Ambient Air Quality Standard; or (b)(ii) Impact any area where an applicable increment is known to be violated; and (v)(e) All other applicable requirements including those for public participation have been met. (vi)(f) The provisions of paragraph (p)(P) (relating to Class I areas) have been satisfied with respect to all periods during the life of the source or modification. (3) The Department shall withdraw any approval to employ a system of innovative control technology made under this section, if: (i)(a) The proposed system fails by the specified date to achieve the required continuous emissions reduction rate; or (ii)(b) The proposed system fails before the specified date so as to contribute to an unreasonable risk to public health, welfare, or safety; or (iii)(c) The Department decides at any time that the proposed system is unlikely to achieve the required level of control or to protect the public health, welfare, or safety. (4) If a source or modification fails to meet the required level of continuous emission reduction within the specified time period or the approval is withdrawn in accordance with paragraph (v)(V)(3), the Department may allow the source or modification up to an additional three (3) years to meet the requirement for the application of best available control technology through use of a demonstrated system of control. (w)(W) Permit rescission . (1) Any permit issued under this section or a prior version of this regulation shall remain in effect, unless and until it expires or is rescinded under this paragraph (w)(W). (2) Any owner or operator of a stationary source or modification who holds a p ermit issued under this section for the construction of a new source or modification that meets the requirement in paragraph (w)(W)(3) of this section may request that the Department rescind the permit or a particular portion of the permit. (3) The Depar tment may grant an application for rescission if the application shows that this section would not apply to the source or modification. (4) If the Department rescinds a permit under this paragraph, the Department shall post a notice of the rescission det ermination on a public website identified by the Department within sixty ( 60) days of (aa)(AA) (1) through (aa)(AA) (15) govern actuals PALs. (1) Applicability. (i)(a) The Department may approve the use of an actuals PAL for any existing major stationary source if the PAL meets the requirements in paragraphs (aa)(AA) (1) through (aa)(AA) (15). The term \"PAL\" shall mean \"actuals PAL\" throughout paragraph (aa) Section (AA) . (ii)(b) Any physical change in or change in the method of operation of a major stationary source that maintains its total source -wide emissions below the PAL level, meets the requirements in paragraphs (aa)(AA) (1) through (aa)(AA) (15), and complies with the PAL permit: (a)(i) Is not a major modification for the PAL pollutant; (b)(ii) Does not have to be approved through Regulation 61 -62.5, Standard 7, Prevention of Significant Deterioration . However, the change will be reviewed through R. Regulation 61-62.1, Section II, A. Permit Requirements ; and (c)(iii) Is not subject to the provisions in paragraph (r)(R)(4) (restrictions on relaxing enforceable emission limitations that the major stationary so urce used to avoid applicability of the major NSR program). (iii)(c) Except as provided under paragraph (aa)(1)(ii)(c) (AA)(1)(b)(iii) , a major stationary source shall continue to comply with all applicable federal or state requirements, emission limitat ions, and work practice requirements that were established prior to the effective date of the PAL. (2) Definitions. The definitions in paragraphs (aa)(2)(i) (AA)(2)(a) through (aa)(2)(xi) (AA)(2)(k) shall apply to actual PALs consistent with paragraphs (aa)(AA) (1) through (aa)(AA) (15). When a term is not defined in these paragraphs, it shall have the meaning given in paragraph (b)(B) or in the Clean Air Act. (i)(a) Actuals PAL for a major stationary source means a PAL based on the baseline actual emis sions (as defined in paragraph (b)(B)(4)) of all emissions units (as defined in paragraph (b)(B)(20)) at the source, that emit or have the potential to emit the PAL pollutant. (ii)(b) \"Allowable emissions \" means \"allowable emissions\" as defined in parag raph (b)(B)(3), except as this definition is modified according to paragraphs (aa)(2)(ii)(a) (AA)(2)(b)(i) and (aa)(2)(ii)(b) (AA)(2)(b)(ii) . (a)(i) The allowable emissions for any emissions unit shall be calculated considering any emission limitations t hat are enforceable as a practical matter on the emissions unit's potential to emit. (b)(ii) An emissions unit's potential to emit shall be determined using the definition in paragraph (b)(B)(37), except that the words \"or enforceable as a practical matter\" should be added after \"federally enforceable.\" (iii)(c) \"Small emissions unit \" means an emissions unit that emits or has the potential to emit the PAL pollutant in an amount less than the significant level for that PAL pollutant, as defined in p aragraph (b)(B)(49) or in the Clean Air Act, whichever is lower. (iv)(d) \"Major emissions unit \" means: (a)(i) Any emissions unit that emits or has the potential to emit one hundred ( 100) tpy tons per year or more of the PAL pollutant in an attainmen t area; or (b)(ii) Any emissions unit that emits or has the potential to emit the PAL pollutant in an amount that is equal to or greater than the major source threshold for the PAL pollutant as defined by the Clean Air Act for nonattainment areas. For example, in accordance with the definition of major stationary source in Section 182(c) of the Clean Air Act, an emissions unit would be a major emissions unit for VOC if the emissions unit is located in a serious ozone nonattainment area and it emits or h as the potential to emit fifty (50) or more tons of VOC per year. (v)(e) \"Plantwide applicability limitation (PAL) \" means an emission limitation expressed in tpy tons per year , for a pollutant at a major stationary source, that is enforceable as a practical matter and established source -wide in accordance with paragraphs (aa)(AA) (1) through (aa)(AA) (15). (vi)(f) \"PAL effective date \" generally means the date of issuance of the PAL permit. However, the PAL effective date for an increased PAL is the date any emissions unit that is part of the PAL major modification becomes operational and begins to emit the PAL pollutant. (vii)(g) \"PAL effective period \" means the period beginning with the PAL effective date and ending ten (10) years later. (viii)(h) \"PAL major modification \" means, notwithstanding paragraphs (b)(B)(30) and (b)(B)(34) (the definitions for major modification and net emissions increase), any physical change in or change in the method of operation of the PAL source that causes it to emit the PAL pollutant at a level equal to or greater than the PAL. (ix)(i) \"PAL permit \" means the major NSR permit, the minor NSR permit, or the state operating permit under Regulation 61 -62.1, Section II.G, or the Title V permit issued by the Departme nt that establishes a PAL for a major stationary source. (x)(j) \"PAL pollutant \" means the pollutant for which a PAL is established at a major stationary source. (xi)(k) \"Significant emissions unit \" means an emissions unit that emits or has the potent ial to emit a PAL pollutant in an amount that is equal to or greater than the significant level (as defined in paragraph (b)(B)(49) or in the Clean Air Act, whichever is lower) for that PAL pollutant, but less than the amount that would qualify the unit as a major emissions unit as defined in paragraph (aa)(2)(iv) (AA)(2)(d) . (3) Permit application requirements. As part of a permit application requesting a PAL, the owner or operator of a major stationary source shall submit the following information to the Department for approval: (i)(a) A list of all emissions units at the source designated as small, significant or major based on their potential to emit. In addition, the owner or operator of the source shall indicate which, if any, federal or state applicable requirements, emission limit ations, or work practices apply to each unit. (ii)(b) Calculations of the baseline actual emissions (with supporting documentation). Baseline actual emissions are to include emissions associated not only with operation of the unit, but also emissions associated with startup, shutdown, and malfunction. (iii)(c) The calculation procedures that the major stationary source owner or operator proposes to use to convert the monitoring system data to monthly emissions and annual emissions based on a twelv e (12)-month rolling total for each month as required by paragraph (aa)(13)(i) (AA)(13)(a) . (4) General requirements for establishing PALs. (i)(a) The Department is allowed to establish a PAL at a major stationary source, provided that at a minimum, the r equirements in paragraphs (aa)(4)(i)(a) (AA)(4)(a)(i) through (aa)(4)(i)(g) (AA)(4)(a)(vii) are met. (a)(i) The PAL shall impose an annual emission limitation in tpy tons per year , that is enforceable as a practical matter, for the entire major stationar y source. For each month during the PAL effective period after the first twelve (12) months of establishing a PAL, the major stationary source owner or operator shall show that the sum of the monthly emissions from each emissions unit under the PAL for the previous twelve (12) consecutive months is less than the PAL (a twelve ( 12)-month average, rolled monthly). For each month during the first eleven (11) months from the PAL effective date, the major stationary source owner or operator shall show that the s um of the preceding monthly emissions from the PAL effective date for each emissions unit under the PAL is less than the PAL. (b)(ii) The PAL shall be established in a PAL permit that meets the public participation requirements in paragraph (aa)(AA) (5). (c)(iii) The PAL permit shall contain all the requirements of paragraph (aa)(AA) (7). (d)(iv) The PAL shall include fugitive emissions, to the extent quantifiable, from all emissions units that emit or have the potential to emit the PAL pollutant at the major stationary source. (e)(v) Each PAL shall regulate emissions of only one pollutant. (f)(vi) Each PAL shall have a PAL effective period of ten (10) years. (g)(vii) The owner or operator of the major stationary source with a PAL shall comply with the monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements provided in paragraphs (aa)(AA) (12) through (aa)(AA) (14) for each emissions unit under the PAL through the PAL effective period. (ii)(b) At no time (during or after the PAL effective period) are emissions reductions of a PAL pollutant that occur during the PAL effective period creditable as decreases for purposes of offsets under 40 CFR 51.165(a)(3)(ii) unless the level of the PAL is reduced by the amount of such emissions reductions and such reductions would be creditable in the absence of the PAL. (5) Public participation requirements for PALs. PALs for existing major stationary sources shall be established, renewed, or increased through a procedure that is consistent with section Section (q)(Q) \"Public Participation\" of this regulation. This includes the requirement that the Department provide the public with notice of the proposed approval of a PAL permit and at least a thirty (30) -day period for submittal of public comment. The De partment must address all material comments before taking final action on the permit. (6) Setting the 10 -year actuals PAL level. (i)(a) Except as provided in paragraph (aa)(6)(ii) (AA)(6)(b) , the actuals PAL level for a major stationary source shall be established as the sum of the baseline actual emissions (as defined in paragraph (b)(B)(4)) of the PAL pollutant for each emissions unit at the source; plus an amount equal to the applicable significant level for the PAL pollutant under paragraph (b)(B)(49) or under the Clean Air Act, whichever is lower. When establishing the actuals PAL level, for a PAL pollutant, only one consecutive twenty -four (24)-month period must be used to determine the baseline actual emissions for all existing emissions units. However, a different consecutive twenty -four ( 24)-month period may be used for each different PAL pollutant. Emissions associated with units that were permanently shut down after this twenty -four (24)-month period must be subtracted from the PAL level. The Department shall specify a reduced PAL level(s) (in tpy tons per year ) in the PAL permit to become effective on the future compliance date(s) of any applicable federal or state regulatory requirement(s) that the Department is aware of prior to the issuance of the PAL permit. For instance, if the source owner or operator will be required to reduce emissions from industrial boilers in half from baseline emissions of sixty (60) parts per milli on (ppm) NO X to a new rule limit of thirty (30) ppm, then the permit shall contain a future effective PAL level that is equal to the current PAL level reduced by half of the original baseline emissions of such unit(s). (ii)(b) For newly constructed unit s (which do not include modification to existing units) on which actual construction began after the twenty -four ( 24)-month period, the emissions must be added to the PAL level in an amount equal to the potential to emit of the units. (7) Contents of the PAL permit. The PAL permit must contain, at a minimum, the information in paragraphs (aa)(7)(i) (AA)(7)(a) through (aa)(7)(x) (AA)(7)(j) . (i)(a) The PAL pollutant and the applicable source -wide emission limitation in tpy tons per year . (ii)(b) The PAL permit effective date and the expiration date of the PAL (PAL effective period). (iii)(c) Specification in the PAL permit that if a major stationary source owner or operator applies to renew a PAL in accordance with paragraph (aa)(AA) (10) before the en d of the PAL effective period, then the PAL shall not expire at the end of the PAL effective period. It shall remain in effect until a revised PAL permit is issued by the Department. (iv)(d) A requirement that emission calculations for compliance purpos es must include emissions from startups, shutdowns, and malfunctions. (v)(e) A requirement that, once the PAL expires, the major stationary source is subject to the requirements of paragraph (aa)(AA) (9). (vi)(f) The calculation procedures that the major stationary source owner or operator shall use to convert the monitoring system data to monthly emissions and annual emissions based on a twelve (12)-month rolling total as required by paragraph (aa)(13)(i) (AA)(13) (a). (vii)(g) A requirement that the major stationary source owner or operator monitor all emissions units in accordance with the provisions under paragraph (aa)(AA) (12). (viii) (h) A requirement to retain the records required under paragraph (aa)(AA) (13) on site. Such records may be retained in an electronic format. (ix)(i) A requirement to submit the reports required under paragraph (aa)(AA) (14) by the required deadlines. (x)(j) Any other requirements that the Department deems necessary to implement and enforce the PAL. (8) PAL effective period and reopening of the PAL permit. The requirements in paragraphs (aa)(8)(i) (AA)(8)(a) and (aa)(8)(ii) (AA)(8)(b) apply to actuals PALs. (i)(a) PAL effective period. The Department shall specify a PAL effective period of ten (10) years. (ii)(b) Reopening of the PAL permit. (a)(i) During the PAL effective period, the Department must reopen the PAL permit to: (1) Correct typographical/calculation errors made in setting the PAL or reflect a more accurate determination of emissions used to establish the PAL; (2) Reduce the PAL if the owner or operator of the major stationary source creates creditable emissions reduction s for use as offsets under 40 CFR 51.165(a)(3)(ii); and (3) Revise the PAL to reflect an increase in the PAL as provided under paragraph (aa)(AA) (11). (b)(ii) The Department shall have discretion to reopen the PAL permit for the following: (1) Reduce the PAL to reflect newly applicable federal requirements (for example, NSPS) with compliance dates after the PAL effective date; (2) Reduce the PAL consistent with any other requirement, that is enforceable as a practical matter, and that the state may impose on the major stationary source under the State Implementation Plan; and (3) Reduce the PAL if the Department determines that a reduction is necessary to avoid causing or contributing to a National Ambient Air Quality Standard or PSD increment violation, or to an adverse impact on an air quality related value that has been identified for a Class I area by a Federal Land Manager and for which information is available to the general public. (c)(iii) Except for the permit reopening in paragraph (aa)(8)(ii)(a)(1) (AA)(8)(b)(i)(1) for the correction of typographical/calculation errors that do not increase the PAL level, all other reopenings shall be carried out in accordance with the public participation requirements of paragraph (aa)(AA) (5). (9) Expiration of a PAL. Any PAL that is not renewed in accordance with the procedures in paragraph (aa)(10) (AA)(10) shall expire at the end of the PAL effective period, and the requirements in paragraphs (aa)(9)(i) (AA)(9)(a) through (aa)(9)(v) (AA)( 9)(e) shall apply. (i)(a) Each emissions unit (or each group of emissions units) that existed under the PAL shall comply with an allowable emission limitation under a revised permit established according to the procedures in paragraphs (aa)(9)(i)(a) (AA)(9)(a)(i) and (aa)(9)(i)(b) (AA)(9)(a)(ii) . (a)(i) Within the time specified for PAL renewals in paragraph (aa)(10)(ii) (AA)(10)(b) , the major stationary source shall submit a proposed allowable emission limitation for each emissions unit (or each group of emissions units, if such a distribution is more appropriate as decided by the Department) by distributing the PAL allowable emissions for the major stationary source among each of the emissions units that existed under the PAL. If the PAL had not yet been adjusted for an applicable requirement that became effective during the PAL effective period, as required under paragraph (aa)(10)(v) (AA)(10)(e) , such distribution shall be made as if the PAL had been adjusted. (b)(ii) The Department shall decide whether and how the PAL allowable emissions will be distributed and issue a revised permit incorporating allowable limits for each emissions unit, or each group of emissions units, as the Department determines is appropriate. (ii)(b) Each emissi ons unit(s) shall comply with the allowable emission limitation on a twelve (12)-month rolling basis. The Department may approve the use of monitoring systems (source testing, emission factors, etc.) other than CEMS, CERMS, PEMS, or CPMS to demonstrate com pliance with the allowable emission limitation. (iii)(c) Until the Department issues the revised permit incorporating allowable limits for each emissions unit, or each group of emissions units, as required under paragraph (aa)(9)(i)(b) (AA)(9)(a)(ii) , the source shall continue to comply with a source -wide, multi -unit emissions cap equivalent to the level of the PAL emission limitation. (iv)(d) Any physical change or change in the method of operation at the major stationary source will be subject to m ajor NSR requirements if such change meets the definition of major modification in paragraph (b)(B)(30). (v)(e) The major stationary source owner or operator shall continue to comply with any state or federal applicable requirements (BACT, RACT, NSPS, e tc.) that may have applied either during the PAL effective period or prior to the PAL effective period except for those emission limitations that had been established pursuant to paragraph (r)(R)(4), but were eliminated by the PAL in accordance with the pr ovisions in paragraph (aa)(1)(ii)(c) (AA)(1)(b)(iii) . (10) Renewal of a PAL. (i)(a) The Department shall follow the procedures specified in paragraph (aa)(AA) (5) in approving any request to renew a PAL for a major stationary source, and shall provide b oth the proposed PAL level and a written rationale for the proposed PAL level to the public for review and comment. During such public review, any person may propose a PAL level for the source for consideration by the Department. (ii)(b) Application dea dline. A major stationary source owner or operator shall submit a timely application to the Department to request renewal of a PAL. A timely application is one that is submitted at least six (6) months prior to, but not earlier than eighteen (18) months fr om, the date of permit expiration. This deadline for application submittal is to ensure that the permit will not expire before the permit is renewed. If the owner or operator of a major stationary source submits a complete application to renew the PAL with in this time period, then the PAL shall continue to be effective until the revised permit with the renewed PAL is issued. (iii)(c) Application requirements. The application to renew a PAL permit shall contain the information required in paragraphs (aa)( 10)(iii)(a) (AA)(10)(c)(i) through (aa)(10)(iii)(d) (AA)(10)(c)(iv) . (AA)(3)(c) . (b)(ii) A proposed PAL level. (c)(iii) The sum of the potential to emit of all emissions units under the PAL (with supporting documentation). (d)(iv) Any other information the owner or operator wishes the Department to consider in determining the appropriate level for renewing the PAL. (iv)(d) PAL adjustment. In determining whether and how to adjust the PAL, the Department shall consider the options outlined in paragraphs (aa)(10)(iv)(a) (AA)(10)(d)(i) and (aa)(10)(iv)(b) (AA)(10)(d)(ii) . However, in no case may any such adjustment fail to comply with paragraph (aa)(10)(iv)(c) (AA)(10)(d)(iii) . (a)(i) If the emissions level calculated in accordance with paragraph (aa)(AA) (6) is equal to or greater than eighty (80) percent of the PAL level, the Department may renew the PAL at the same lev el without considering the factors set forth in paragraph (aa)(10)(iv)(b) (AA)(10)(d)(ii) ; or (b)(ii) The Department may set the PAL at a level that it determines to be more representative of the source's baseline actual emissions, or that it determines to be more appropriate considering air quality needs, advances in control technology, anticipated economic growth in the area, desire to reward or encourage the source's voluntary emissions reductions, or other factors as specifically identified by the Department in its written rationale. (c)(iii) Notwithstanding paragraphs (aa)(10)(iv)(a) (AA)(10)(d)(i) and (aa)(10)(iv)(b) (AA)(10)(d)(ii) : (1) If the potential to emit of the major stationary source is less than the PAL, the Department shall adjust the PAL to a level no greater than the potential to emit of the source; and (2) The Department shall not approve a renewed PAL level higher than the current PAL, unless the major stationary source has complied with the provisions of paragraph (aa)(AA) (11) (increasing a PAL). (v)(e) If the compliance date for a state or federal requirement that applies to the PAL source occurs during the PAL effective period, and if the Department has not already adjusted for such requirement, the PAL shall be adjust ed at the time of PAL permit renewal or Title V permit renewal, whichever occurs first. (11) Increasing a PAL during the PAL effective period. (i)(a) The Department may increase a PAL emission limitation only if the major stationary source complies with the provisions in paragraphs (aa)(11)(i)(a) (AA)(11)(a)(i) through (aa)(11)(i)(d) (AA)(11)(a)(iv) . (a)(i) The owner or operator of the major stationa ry source shall submit a complete application to request an increase in the PAL limit for a PAL major modification. Such application shall identify the emissions unit(s) contributing to the increase in emissions so as to cause the major stationary source's emissions to equal or exceed its PAL. (b)(ii) As part of this application, the major stationary source owner or operator shall demonstrate that the sum of the baseline actual emissions of the small emissions units, plus the sum of the baseline actual emissions of the significant and major emissions units assuming application of BACT equivalent controls, plus the sum of the allowable emissions of the new or modified emissions unit(s) exceeds the PAL. The level of control that would result from BACT equi valent controls on each significant or major emissions unit shall be determined by conducting a new BACT analysis at the time the application is submitted, unless the emissions unit is currently required to comply with a BACT or LAER requirement that was e stablished within the preceding ten (10) years. In such a case, the assumed control level for that emissions unit shall be equal to the level of BACT or LAER with which that emissions unit must currently comply. (c)(iii) The owner or operator obtains a major NSR permit for all emissions unit(s) identified in paragraph (aa)(11)(i)(a) (AA)(11)(a)(i) , regardless of the magnitude of the emissions increase resulting from them (that is, no significant levels apply). These emissions unit(s) shall comply with an y emissions requirements resulting from the major NSR process (for example, BACT), even though they have also become subject to the PAL or continue to be subject to the PAL. (d)(iv) The PAL permit shall require that the increased PAL level shall be effective on the day any emissions unit that is part of the PAL major modification becomes operational and begins to emit the PAL pollutant. (ii)(b) The Department shall calculate the n ew PAL as the sum of the allowable emissions for each modified or new emissions unit, plus the sum of the baseline actual emissions of the significant and major emissions units (assuming application of BACT equivalent controls as determined in accordance w ith paragraph (aa)(11)(i)(b) (AA)(11)(a)(ii) ), plus the sum of the baseline actual emissions of the small emissions units. (iii)(c) The PAL permit shall be revised to reflect the increased PAL level pursuant to the public notice requirements of paragraph (aa)(AA) (5). (12) Monitoring requirements for P ALs. (i)(a) General requirements. (a)(i) Each PAL permit must contain enforceable requirements for the monitoring system that accurately determines plantwide emissions of the PAL pollutant in terms of mass per unit of time. Any monitoring system authorized for use in the PAL permit must be based on sound science and meet generally acceptable scientific procedures for data quality and manipulation. Additionally, the information generated by such system must meet minimum legal requirements for admissibility in a judicial proceeding to enforce the P AL permit. (b)(ii) The PAL monitoring system must employ one or more of the four general monitoring approaches meeting the minimum requirements set forth in paragraphs (aa)(12)(ii)(a) (AA)(12)(b)(i) through (aa)12(ii)(d) (AA)(12)(b)(iv) and must be appro the Department. (c)(iii) Notwithstanding paragraph (aa)(12)(i)(b) (AA)(12)(a)(ii) , the owner or operator may also employ an alternative monitoring approach that meets paragraph (aa)(12)(i)(a) (AA)(12)(a)(i) if approved by the Department. (d)(iv) Failure to use a monitoring system that meets the requirements of this regulation renders the PAL invalid. (ii)(b) Minimum performance requirements for approved monitoring approaches. The following are acceptable general monitoring approaches when co nducted in accordance with the minimum requirements in paragraphs (aa)(12)(iii) (AA)(12)(c) through (aa)(12)(ix) (AA)(12)(b)(i) : (a)(i) Mass balance solvents; (b)(ii) CEMS; (c)(iii) CPMS or PEMS; and (d)(iv) Emission factors. (iii)(c) Mass balance calculations. An owner or operator using mass balance calculations to monitor PAL pollutant emissions from activities using coating or solvents shall meet the following requirements: (a)(i) Provide a demonstrated means of validating the published content of the PAL pollutant that is contained in or created by all materials used in or at the emissions unit; (b)(ii) Assume that the emissions unit emits all of the PAL pollutant that is cont ained in or created by any raw material or fuel used in or at the emissions unit, if it cannot otherwise be accounted for in the process; and (c)(iii) Where the vendor of a material or fuel, which is used in or at the emissions unit, publishes a range of pollutant content from such material, the owner or operator must use the highest value of the range to calculate the PAL pollutant emissions unless the Department determines there is site -specific data or a site-specific monitoring program to support an other content within the range. (iv)(d) CEMS. An owner or operator using CEMS to monitor PAL pollutant emissions shall meet the following requirements: (a)(i) CEMS must comply with applicable Performance Specifications found in 40 CFR Part 60, Appen dix B; and (b)(ii) CEMS must sample, analyze and record data at least every fifteen (15) minutes while the emissions unit is operating. (v)(e) CPMS or PEMS. An owner or operator using CPMS or PEMS to monitor PAL pollutant emissions shall meet the fo llowing requirements: (a)(i) The CPMS or the PEMS must be based on current site -specific data demonstrating a correlation between the monitored parameter(s) and the PAL pollutant emissions across the range of operation of the emissions unit; and (b)(ii) Each CPMS or PEMS must sample, analyze, and record data at least every fifteen (15) minutes, or at another less frequent interval approved by the Department, while the emissions unit is operating. (vi)(f) Emission factors. An owner or operator usi ng emission factors to monitor PAL pollutant emissions shall meet the following requirements: (a)(i) All emission factors shall be adjusted, if appropriate, to account for the degree of uncertainty or limitations in the factors' development; (b)(ii) The emissions unit shall operate within the designated range of use for the emission factor, if applicable; and (c)(iii) If technically practicable, the owner or operator of a significant emissions unit that relies on an emission factor to calculate PAL pollutant emissions shall conduct validation testing to determine a site-specific emission factor within six (6) months of PAL permit issuance, unless the Department determines that testing is not required. (vii)(g) A source owner or operator must record and report maximum potential emissions without considering enforceable emission limitations or operational restrictions for an emissions unit during any period of time that there is no monitoring data, unless another method for determining emissions during such periods is specified in the PAL permit. (viii) (h) Notwithstanding the requirements in paragraphs (aa)(12)(iii) (AA)(12)(c) through (aa)(12)(vii) (AA)(12)(g) , where an owner or operator of an emissions unit cannot demonstrate a correlation between the monitored parameter(s) and the PAL pollutant emissions rate at all operating points of the emissions unit, the Departm ent shall, at the time of permit issuance: (a)(i) Establish default value(s) for determining compliance with the PAL based on the highest potential emissions reasonably estimated at such operating point(s); or (b)(ii) Determine that operation of the emissions unit during operating conditions when there is no correlation between monitored parameter(s) and the PAL pollutant emissions is a violation of the PAL. (ix)(i) Re-validation. All data used to establish the PAL pollutant must be re -validated through performance testing or other scientifically valid means approved by the Department. Such testing must occur at least once every five ( 5) years after issuance of the PAL. (13) Recordkeeping requirements . (i)(a) The PAL permit shall require an owner or operator to retain a copy of all records necessary to determine compliance with any requirement of paragraph (aa) Section (AA) and of the PAL, including a determination of each emissions unit's twelve ( 12)-month roll ing total emissions, for five (5) years from the date of such record. (ii)(b) The PAL permit shall require an owner or operator to retain a copy of the following records for the duration of the PAL effective period plus five (5) years: (a)(i) A copy of the PAL permit application and any applications for revisions to the PAL; and (b)(ii) Each annual certification of compliance pursuant to Title V and the data relied on in certifying the compliance. (14) Reporting and notification requirements . The owner or operator shall submit semi -annual monitoring reports and prompt deviation reports to the Department in accordance with the applicable title V operating permit program Regulation 61 -62.70 . The reports shall meet the requirements in (AA)(14)(a) through (aa)(14)(iii) (AA)(14)(c) . (i)(a) Semi -annual report. The semi -annual report shall be submitted to the Department within 30 days of the end of each reporting period.

(ii)(b) The Department may supersede any PAL that was established prior to th e date these provisions become effective with a PAL that complies with the requirements of paragraphs (aa)(AA) (1) through (aa)(AA) (15). (bb)(BB) If any provision of this regulation, or the application of such provision to any person or circumstance, is held invalid, the remainder of this regulation, or the application of such provision to persons or circumstances other than those as to which it is held invalid, shall not be affected thereby. 61-62.5. Standard No. 7.1. Nonattainment New Source Review (NSR) (a)(A) Applicability . (1) This rule applies to all major stationary sources constructed or modified in any nonattainment area as designated i n 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 81.341 (\"nonattainment area\") if the emissions from such facility will cause or contribute to concentrations of a regulated NSR pollutant (as defined in paragraph (c)(13) (B)(32) ) for which the nonattainment area was d esignated as nonattainment. Applicability to this regulation shall be based on the pollutant emission rate set out in paragraph (c)(14) (B)(37) for only those pollutants for which the area's designation is based. (A)(a) The requirements of paragraph (d) this regulation apply to the construction of any new major stationary source or the major modification of any existing major stationary source, except as provided in paragraph (b) Section(A)(10) . (B)(b) No new major stationary source or major modificati on to which the requirements of paragraph (d) this regulation apply shall begin actual construction without a permit that states that the major stationary source or major modification will meet those requirements. The Department has authority to issue any such permit. (2) Redesignation to attainment . If any nonattainment area to which this regulation applies is later designated in 40 CFR 81.341 as attainment, all sources in that nonattainment area subject to this regulation before the redesignation date s hall continue to comply with this regulation. (3) For any area designated as nonattainment a major stationary source or major modification that is major for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) or oxides of nitrogen oxides is also major for ozone. (b) Appl icability procedures. (1)(4) Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (b)(7) (A)(9) , and consistent with the definition of major modification contained as defined in paragraph (c)(6)(A) (B)(21)(a) , a project is a major modification for a regulated NSR pollutant if it causes two types of emissions increases - a significant emissions increase (as defined in paragraph (c)(15) (B)(38) , and a significant net emissions increase (as defined in paragraphs (c)(8) (B)(24) and (15)(B)(37) ). The project is not a major modification if it does not cause a significant emissions increase. If the project causes a significant emissions increase, then the project is a major modification only if it also results in a sign ificant net emissions increase. (2)(5) The procedure for calculating , (before beginning actual construction ), whether a significant emissions increase (the first step of the process) will occur depends upon the type of emissions units being modified, acc ording to paragraphs (b)(1) (A)(6) through (6)(A)(8) . The procedure for calculating , (before beginning actual construction ), whether a significant net emissions increase will occur at the major stationary source (the second step of the process) is contained in the definition in paragraph (c)(8) (B)(24) . Regardless of any such preconstruction projections, a major modification res ults if the project causes a significant emissions increase and a significant net emissions increase. (3)(6) Actual -to-projected -actual applicability test for projects that only involve existing emissions units . A significant emissions increase of a regulated NSR pollutant is projected to occur if the sum of the difference between the projected actual emissions (as defined in paragraph (c)(11) (B)(31) ) and the baseline actual emissions (as defined in paragraphs (c)(2)(A) (B)(3)(a) and (B)(B)(3)(b), as applicable), for each existing emissions unit, equals or exceeds the significant amount for that pollutant (as defined in paragraph (c)(14) (B)(37) ). (4)(7) Actual -to-potential test for projects that only involve cons truction of a new emissions unit(s) . A signif icant emissions increase of a regulated NSR pollutant is projected to occur if the sum of the difference between the potential to emit (as defined in paragraph (b)(37) of Regulation 61 -62.5 Standard 7, \"Prevention of Significant Deterioration \" (\"Standard 7\") (B)(27) ) from each new emissions unit following completion of the project and the baseline actual emissions (as defined in paragraph (c)(2)(C) (B)(3)(c) ) of these units before the project equals or exc eeds the significant amount for that pollutant (as defined in paragraph (c)(14) (B)(37) ). (5) [Reserved] (6)(8) Hybrid test for projects that involve multiple types of emissions units . A significant emissions increase of a regulated NSR pollutant is projected to occur if the sum of the emissions increases for each emissions unit, using the method specified in paragraphs (b)(3) (A)(6) and (4)(A)(7) as applicable with respect to each emiss ions unit, for each type of emissions unit equals or exceeds the significant amount for that pollutant (as defined in paragraph (c)(14) (B)(37) ). (7)(9) For any major stationary source for a Plantwide Applicability Limitation (PAL) for a regulated NSR po llutant, the major stationary source shall comply with requirements under paragraph Section (i)(N) (10) The provisions of this section shall not apply to a particular major stationary source or major modification if the source or modification would be a m ajor stationary source or major modification only if fugitive emissions, to the extent quantifiable, are considered in calculating the potential to emit of the stationary source or modification and the source does not belong to any of the following categor ies: (a) Coal cleaning plants (with thermal dryers); (b) Kraft pulp mills; (c) Portland cement plants; (d) Primary zinc smelters; (e) Iron and steel mills; (f) Primary aluminum ore reduction plants; (g) Primary copper smelters; (h) Municipal incinerators capable of charging more than 250 tons of refuse per day; (i) Hydrofluoric, sulfuric, or nitric acid plants; (j) Petroleum refineries; (k) Lime plants; (l) Phosphate rock processing plants; (m) Coke oven batteries; (n) Sulfur recovery plants; (o) Carbon black plants (furnace process); (p) Primary lead smelters; (q) Fuel conversion plants; (r) Sintering plants; (s) Secondary metal production plants; (t) Chemical process plants - The term chemical pro cessing plant shall not include ethanol production facilities that produce ethanol by natural fermentation included in NAICS codes 325193 or 312140; (u) Fossil -fuel boilers (or combination thereof) totaling more than 250 million British thermal units per hour heat input; (v) Petroleum storage and transfer units with a total storage capacity exceeding 300,000 barrels; (w) Taconite ore processing plants; (x) Glass fiber processing plants; (y) Charcoal production plants; (z) Fossil fuel -fired steam electric plants of more than 250 million British thermal units per hour heat input; and (aa) Any other stationary source category which, as of August 7, 1980, is being regulated under Section 111 or 112 of the Clean Air Act. (c)(B) Definitions. The following definitions apply to this Standard only. Any other term contained within this Standard is as defined where indicated in Regulation 61 -62.5, Standard 7, Prevention of Significant Deterioration. For the purposes of this regulation: (1)(A)(a) \"Actual emissions \" means the actual rate of emissions of a regulated NSR pollutant from an emissions unit, as determined in accordance with paragraphs (c)(1)(B) (B)(1)(b) through (D)(B)(1)(d) , except that this definition shall not apply for calculating whet her a significant emissions increase has occurred, or for establishing a PAL under paragraph Section (i)(N). Instead, paragraphs (c)(2) (B)(3) and (c)(11) (B)(31) shall apply for those purposes. (B)(b) In general, actual emissions as of a particular date shall equal the average rate, in tons per year (tpy) , at which the unit actually emitted the pollutant during a consecutive twenty -four ( 24)-month period which precedes the particular date and which is representative of normal source operation. The Department shall allow the use of a different time period upon a determination that it is more representative of normal source operation. Actual emissions shall be calculated using the unit's actual operating hours, production rates, and types of materials processed, stored, or combusted during the selected time period. (C)(c) The Department may presume that source -specific allowable emissions for the unit are equivalent to the actual emissions of the unit. (D)(d) For any emissions unit that has not begun normal operations on the particular date, actual emissions shall equal the potential to emit of the unit on that date. (2) Allowable emissions means the emissions rate of a stationary source calculated using the maximum rated capacity of the source (unless the source is subject to federally enforceable limits which restrict the operating rate, or hours of operation, or both) and the most stringent of the following: (a) The applicable standards as set forth in 40 CFR Parts 60 and 61; (b) Any applicable State Implementation Plan emissions limitation, including those with a future compliance date; or (c) The emissions rate specified as a federally enforceable permit condition, including those with a future compliance date. (2)(3) \"Baseline actual emissions \" means the rate of emissions, in tpy tons per year , of a regulated NSR pollutant, as determined in accordance with paragraphs (c)(2)(A) (B)(3)(a) through (D)(B)(3)(d) . (A)(a) For any existing electric utility steam generating unit, baseline actual emissions means the average rate, in tpy tons per year , at which the unit actually emitted the pollutant during any consecutive twenty -four ( 24)-month period selected by the owner or operator within the five ( 5)-year period immediately preceding when the owner or operator begins actual construction of the project. The Department shall allow the use of a different time period upon a determination that it is more representative of norma l source operation. (i) The average rate shall include fugitive emissions to the extent quantifiable, and emissions associated with startups, shutdowns, and malfunctions. (ii) The average rate shall be adjusted downward to exclude any non -compliant emissions that occurred while the source was operating above any emission limitation that was legally enforceable during the consecutive twenty -four ( 24)-month period. (iii) For a regulated NSR pollutant, when a project involves multiple emissions uni ts, only one consecutive twenty -four ( 24)-month period must be used to determine the baseline actual emissions for the emissions units being changed. A different consecutive twenty -four ( 24)-month period can be used for each regulated NSR pollutant. (iv) The average rate shall not be based on any consecutive twenty -four ( 24)-month period for which there is inadequate information for determining annual emissions, in tpy tons per year , and for adjusting this amount if required by paragraph (c)(2)(A)(ii) (B)(3)(a)(ii) . (B)(b) For an existing emissions unit (other than an electric utility steam generating unit), baseline actual emissions means the average rate, in tpy tons per year , at which the emissions unit actually emitted the pollutant during any consecutive twenty -four ( 24)-month period selected by the owner or operator within the ten (10)-year period immediately preceding either the date the owner or operator begins actual construction of the project, or the date a complete permit application is received by the Department for a permit required either under this section or under a plan approved by the Administrator whichever is earlier, except that the ten ( 10)-year period shal l not include any period earlier than November 15, 1990. The Department reserves the right to determine if the twenty -four ( 24)-month period selected is appropriate. (i) The average rate shall include fugitive emissions to the extent quantifiable, and emissions associated with startups, shutdowns, and malfunctions. (ii) The average rate shall be adjusted downward to exclude any non -compliant emissions that occurred while the source was operating above an emission limitation that was legally enforcea ble during the consecutive twenty -four ( 24)-month period. (iii) The average rate shall be adjusted downward to exclude any emissions that would have exceeded an emission limitation with which the major stationary source must currently comply, had such major stationary source been required to comply with such limitations during the consec utive twenty -four (24)-month period. However, if an emission limitation is part of a maximum achievable control technology standard that the Administrator proposed or pr omulgated under 40 CFR Part 63, the baseline actual emissions need only be adjusted if the state has taken credit for such emissions reductions in an attainment demonstration or maintenance plan consistent with the requirements of paragraph (d)(1)(c)(viii) (D)(7) (iv) For a regulated NSR pollutant, when a project involves multiple emissions units, only one consecutive twenty -four ( 24)-month period must be used to determine the baseline actual emissions for the emissions units being changed. A different c onsecutive twenty -four ( 24)-month period can be used for each regulated NSR pollutant. (v) The average rate shall not be based on any consecutive twenty -four ( 24)-month period for which there is inadequate information for determining annual emissions, in tpy tons per year , and for adjusting this amount if required by paragraphs (c)(2)(B)(ii) (B)(3)(b)(ii) and (iii)(B)(3)(b)(iii) . (C)(c) For a new emissions unit, the baseline actual emissions for purposes of determining the emissions increase that will result from the initial construction and operation of such unit shall equal zero; and thereafter, for all other purposes, shall equal the unit's potential to emit. (D)(d) For a PAL for a major stationary source, the baseline actual emissions shall be calculated for existing electric utility steam generating units in accordance with the procedures contained in paragraph (c)(2)(A) (B)(3)(a) , for other existing emissions units in accordance with the procedures contained in paragraph (c)(2)(B) (B)(3)(b) , and for a new emissions unit in accordance with the procedures contained in paragraph (c)(2)(C) (B)(3)(c) . (4) Begin actual construction means , in general, initiation of physical on -site construction activities on an emissions unit which are of a permanent nature. Such activities include, but are not limited to, installation of building supports and foundations, laying of underground pipework, a nd construction of permanent storage structures. With respect to a change in method of operating this term refers to those on -site activities other than preparatory activities which mark the initiation of the change. (3)(5) \"Best available control technology (BACT) \" means an emissions limitation (including a visible emissions standard) based on the maximum degree of reduction for each regulated NSR pollutant which would be emitted from any proposed major stationary source or major modification which the Department, on a case -by-case basis, taking into account energy, environmental, and economic impacts and other costs, determines is achievable for such source or modification through application of production processes or available methods, systems, a nd techniques, including fuel cleaning or treatment or innovative fuel combustion techniques for control of such pollutant. In no event shall application of best available control technology result in emissions of any pollutant which would exceed the emiss ions allowed by any applicable standard under 40 CFR Parts 60 or 61. If the Department determines that technological or economic limitations on the application of measurement methodology to a particular emissions unit would make the imposition of an emissi ons standard infeasible, a design, equipment, work practice, operational standard, or combination thereof, may be prescribed instead to satisfy the requirement for the application of BACT. Such standard shall, to the degree possible, set forth the emission s reduction achievable by implementation of such design, equipment, work practice or operation, and shall provide for compliance by means which achieve equivalent results.

(a) The emissions unit is a reconstructed unit within the meaning of 40 CFR 60.15(b)(1), or the emissions unit completely takes the place of an existi ng emissions unit; (b) The emissions unit is identical to or functionally equivalent to the replaced emissions unit; (c) The replacement does not alter the basic design parameters of the process unit; and (d) The replaced emissions unit is permane ntly removed from the major stationary source, otherwise permanently disabled, or permanently barred from operation by a permit that is enforceable as a practical matter. If the replaced emissions unit is brought back into operation, it shall constitute a new emissions unit. (34) Resource recovery facility means any facility at which solid waste is processed for the purpose of extracting, converting to energy, or otherwise separating and preparing solid waste for reuse. Energy conversion facilities must u tilize solid waste to provide more than fifty (50) percent of the heat input to be considered a resource recovery facility under this Ruling. (35) Reviewing authority means the state air pollution control agency, local agency, other state agency, Indian tribe, or other agency authorized by the Administrator to carry out a permit program under 40 CFR 51.165 and 40 CFR 51.166, or the Administrator in the case of EPA -implemented permit programs under 40 CFR 52.21. (36) Secondary emissions means emissions w hich would occur as a result of the construction or operation of a major stationary source or major modification, but do not come from the major stationary source or major modification itself. Secondary emissions must be specific, well defined, quantifiabl e, and impact the same general area as the stationary source or modification which causes the secondary emissions. Secondary emissions include emissions from any offsite support facility which would not be constructed or increase its emissions except as a result of the construction or operation of the major stationary source or major modification. Secondary emissions do not include any emissions which come directly from a mobile source, such as emissions from the tailpipe of a motor vehicle, from a train, o r from a vessel. (14)(37) \"Significant \" means, in reference to a net emissions increase or the potential of a source to emit any of the following pollutants, as a rate of emissions that would equal or exceed any of the following rates: Pollutant Emission Rate Carbon monoxide: 100 tpy Nitrogen oxides: 40 tpy Particulate matter: 15 tpy of PM 10 emissions 10 tpy of direct PM 2.5; 40 tpy of sulfur dioxide emissions; 40 tpy of nitrogen oxide emissions unless demonstrated not to be a PM 2.5 precursor under paragraph 13 of this section Sulfur dioxide: 40 tpy Ozone: 40 tpy of volatile organic compounds oxides of nitrogen Lead: 0.6 tpy Pollutant Emiss ions Rate (tons per year) Carbon monoxide Marginal and M oderate Nonattainment Areas 100 Serious Nonattainment Area s 50* Nitrogen oxides 40 Sulfur dioxide 40 PM 10 15 PM 2.5 of direct PM 2.5 10 of SO2, NOX, or VOC 40 Ozone Marginal and Moderate Nonattainment Areas 40 (of VOC or NO X) Serious and Severe Nonattainment Areas 25 (of VOC or NO X) Extreme Nonattainment Areas Any (of VOC or NO X) Lead 0.6 * The significant emissi on rate of 50 tons for car bon monoxide in serio us nonattai nment areas shall only apply if the Administrator has made a determi nation that stationary sources significantly contribute to the carbon monoxide levels in the area. (15)(38) \"Significant emissions increase \" means, for a regulated NSR pollutant, an increase in emissions that is significant (as defined in paragraph (c)(14) (B)(37) ) for that pollutant. (39) Stationary source means any building, structure, facility, or installation which emits or may emit a regulated NSR pollutant. (16)(40) \"Volatile organic compounds (VOC) \" is as defined in Regulation 61 -62.1, Section (I), Definitions . (d) Permitting requirements (C)(1) Conditions for approval . Permitting requirements. If the Department finds that the major stationary source or major modification would be constructed in an area designated in 40 CFR 81.341 as nonattainment for a pollutant fo r which the stationary source or modification is major, approval may be granted only if the following conditions are met: (A)(a) The major stationary source or major modification is required to meet an emission limitation which specifies the lowest achievable emission rate ( LAER ) for such source. (B)(b) The applicant must certify that all existing major sources owned or operated by the applicant (or any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the applicant) in the same stat e as the proposed source are in compliance with all applicable emission limitations and standards under the Clean Air Act (or are in compliance with an expeditious schedule which is federally enforceable or contained in a court decree). (C)(c) The owner or operator of the proposed new major stationary source or major modification will obtain sufficient emission reductions of the nonattainment pollutant from other sources. Emission reductions shall be in effect and enforceable prior to the date the new so urce or modification commences operation. The emission reductions shall be obtained in accordance with the following provisions: requirements in Section (D), Offset standards. (d) The emission offsets must provide a positive net air quality benefit in t he affected area as determined by 40 CFR Part 51, Appendix S, Emission Offset Interpretative Ruling . (e) Alternative Sites Analysis. An analysis of alternative sites, sizes, production processes, and environmental control techniques for such proposed so urce demonstrates that benefits of the proposed source significantly outweigh the environmental and social costs imposed as a result of its location, construction, or modification shall be required. (2) Exemption s. Temporary emission sources, such as pilot plants and portable facilities which will be relocat ed outside of the nonattainment area after a sh ort period of time, are exem pt from the requirements of paragraphs (C)(1)(c) and (C)(1)(d) of this section. (3) Secondary emissions. Secondary emissions need not be considered in determining whether the stationary source or modification is major. However, if a source is subject to this regulation on the basis of the direct emissions from the source, the applicable conditions in paragraph (C)(1) must also be met for secondary emissions. However, secondary emissions may be exempt from paragraphs (C)(1)(a) and (C)(1)(b) of this section. (4) The requirements of this regulation applicable to major stationary sources and major modifications of PM 10 shall also apply to major stationary sources and major modifications of PM 10 precursors, except where the Administrator determines that such sources do not contribute significantly to PM 10 levels that exceed the PM 10 ambient standards in the area. (D) Offset standar ds. (1) All emission reductions claimed as offset credit shall be perm anent, quantifi able, federally enforceable and surplus; (i)(2) Where the permitted emissions limit allows greater emissions than the potential to emit of the source (as when a state has a single particulate emission limit for all fuels) , emissions offset credit will be allowed only for control below this potential; (ii)(3) For an existing fuel combustion source, credit shall be based on the allowable emissions for the type of fuel being burned at the time the application to construct is filed. If the existing source commits to switch to a cleaner fuel at some future date, e mission s offset credit based on the allowable (or actual) emissions for the fuels involved is not acceptable, unless the permit is conditioned to require the use of a specified alternative control measure which would achieve the same degree of emissions re duction should the source switch back to a dirtier fuel at some later date. (iii)(a) (4) Emissions reductions achieved by shutting down an existing source or curtailing production or operating hours below baseline levels may be generally credited if such reductions are permanent, quantifiable, federally enforceable, occurred on or after the date of the most recent emissions inventory, and if the area has an EPA -approved attainment plan. for offsets if the shutdown or curtailment occurred after the last day of the base year for the SIP planning process. For purposes of this paragra ph, the Department may choose to consider a prior shutdown or curtailment to have occurred after the last day of the base year if the projected emissions inventory used to develop the attainment demonstrati on explicitly includes the emissions from such previously shutdown or curtailed emission units. No credit may be given f or shutdowns that occurred before August 7, 1977. (b)(5) Such reductions may be credited if Emiss ions redu ctions ach ieved by shutting down an existing emiss ions unit or curtailing production or operating hours and that do not meet the requir ements in paragraph (D)(4 ) may be generally credited only if: (a) the The shutdown or curtailment occurred on or after the date the new source permit application is filed,; or, (b) if the The applicant can establish that the proposed new source is a replacement for the shutdown or curtailed source, and the cutoff date provision of paragraph (d)(C)(iii)(a) are observed emission reductions achieved by the shutdown or curtailment met the requirements of paragraph (D)(4) . (iv)(6) No emissions credit may be allowed for replacing one hydrocarbon compound with another of lesser reactivity, except for those compounds listed in Table 1 of EPA's \"Recommended Policy on Control of Volatile Organic Compounds\" (42 FR 35314, July 8, 1977); (v) All emission reductions claimed as offset credit shall be federally enforceable and surplus; (7) Credit for an emissions reduction can be claimed to the extent that the Department has not relied on it in issuing any permit under regulations approved pursuant to 40 CFR Part 51, Subpart I or the Department has not relied on it in demonstrating attainment or reasonable further progress. (8) The total tonnage of increased emissions, in tons per year, resulting from a major modification that must be offset in accordance with Section 173 of the Clean Air Act shall be determined by summing the difference between the allowable emissions after the modification (as defined by paragraph (B)(2)) and the actual emissions before the modification (as defined in paragraph (B)(1)) for each emissions unit. (9) If a designated nonattainment area is projected to be an attainment area as part of an approved S IP control strategy by the new source start -up date, offsets would not be required if the new source would not cause a new violation. (a)(10) Eligibility as Emission Offsets . Any facility that has the potential to emit any NAAQS pollutant in an amount gr eater than five ( 5) tpy tons per year and that is located in a federally -designated nonattainment area shall be eligible to create emission offsets . (1) To be eligible to be an emission offset: (A) A reduction in emissions shall be permanent, quantifiable, enforceable, and surplus and must have occurred after December 31 of the base year inventory for those pollutants that are designated nonattainment by the EPA. The base year inventory date is two years preceding the date of nonattainment designation. However, the Department may choose to consider a prior shutdown or curtailment to have occurred after the last day of the base year if the projected emissions inventory used to develop the attainment demonstration explicitly includes the emissions from such previously shutdown or curtailed emission units. (B)(11) Emission reductions shall have been created by an existing facility that has obtained an enforceable air quality permit or letter of permit cancellation resulting from the surrender of t he source's permit(s). (2)(12) Emission reductions may be created by any of, or a combination of , the following methods: (A)(a) Installation of control equipment beyond what is necessary to comply with existing requirements; (B)(b) A change in process inputs, formulations, products or product mix, fuels, or raw materials; (C)(c) A reduction in actual emission rates; or (D) A reduction in hours of operation; (E) Production curtailment or reduction in throughput; (F) Shutd own of emitting sources; or (G)(d) Any other enforceable method that the Department determines to result in real, permanent, quantifiable, federally enforceable, and surplus reduction of emissions. (3)(13) A completed emissions offset submittal must b e received by the Department within one (1) year of the date of the creation of the reductions. Emission offsets not requested within one (1) year of the date of the creation of the reductions will be permanently retired. Prior to commencing operation of a permitted emissions unit, Department approval for the required emission offsets must be granted. (4)(14) The following emission reductions that are not considered surplus, are ineligible for emission offsets: (A) Emission reductions that are not cons idered surplus, such as: (i)(a) Emission reductions that have previously been used to avoid Regulation 61 -62.5 Standard No. 7, Prevention of Significant Deterioration, or Regulation 61 -62.5 Standard No. 7.1, Nonattainment New Source Review (NSR), through a netting demonstration; (ii)(b) Emission reductions of hazardous air pollutants, listed in Section 112(b) of the Clean Air Act, to the extent needed to comply with Regulation 61 -62.61, National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants ( NESHAP), and Regulation 61 -62.63, National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) for Source Categories , (however . However , emission reductions of hazardous volatile organic compound (VOC) and/or hazardous particulate matter (PM) air pollutants beyond the amount of reductions necessary to comply with Regulation 61 -62.61, NESHAP, and Regulation 61 -62.63, NESHAP for Source Categories, are considered surplus ); (iii)(c) Emission reductions of nitrogen oxides (NO X), sulfur dioxide (SO 2), particulate matter (PM) and VOCs to the extent needed to comply with Section 111 of the CAA Clean Air Act and Regulation 61-62.60, S outh Carolina Designated Facility Plan and New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) , (however . However , emission reductions of VOCs, NO X, SO 2, PM and VOCs beyond the amount of reductions necessary to comply with Regulation 61 -62.60, S outh Carolina Designated Facility Plan and NSPS , are considered surplus ); (iv)(d) Emission reductions from emission units covered under an agreement, order , or variance for exceeding an emission standard until compliance is demonstrated with the emission standard that is the subject of the agreement, order or variance; (v)(e) Sources Emission reductions from sources that have operated less than twelve ( 12) months; (vi)(f) Emission reductions required in order to comply with any state or federal regulation not listed above, unless these reductions are in excess of the amount required by the state or federal regulation; or and (vii)(g) Facilities Emission reductions from facilities that have received a Department transmittal letter notifying with notification of permit cancellation due to the facility's decision to close out its operating permit without a request to qualify facility emis sion reductions as offsets. (E) (b) Calculation of Emission Offsets (1) The following procedure shall be used to calculate emission offsets: (A)(a) The source shall calculate average annual actual emissions, in tpy tons per year , before the emission reduction using data from the twenty -four ( 24)-month period immediately preceding the reduction in emissions. With the Department's approval, the use of a different time period, not to exceed ten ( 10) years immediately preceding the reduction in emissions, may be allowed if the owner or operator of the source documents that such period is more representative of normal source operation, but not prior to the base year inventory date, which is the last day of the two (2) years preceding the date of nonattainme nt designation; and (B)(b) The emission offsets created shall be calculated by subtracting the allowable emissions following the reduction from the average annual actual emissions prior to the reduction. (2) For any emissions unit that has been operat ing for a consecutive period of at least twelve ( 12) months but less than twenty -four ( 24) months on the base year inventory date, based on the unit's potential to emit, emissions shall be calculated equal to the amount needed to complete a twenty -four ( 24)-month period on the base year inventory date. (F) (vi) Location of offsetting emissions. Emission offsets shall be obtained from sources currently operating within the same designated nonattainment area as the new or modified stationary source. Emission offsets may be obtained from another nonattainment area with the Department's approval only if : (a) the other area has an equal or higher nonattainment classification than the area in which the proposed source is located and (b) emissions from the other a rea contribute to a violation of the NAAQS in the nonattainment area in which the source is located. (1) The other area has an equal or higher nonattainment classification than the area in which the proposed source is located, and (2) Emissions from the other area contribute to a violation of the NAAQS in the nonattainment area in which the source is located. (G) (vii) Emission offsetting ratios . Emission offsets shall be required in nonattainment areas in accordance with the following provisions: (a)(1) Emissions for carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2), sulfur dioxide (SO 2), lead (Pb), and particulate matter (PM 10 and PM 2.5) nonattainment areas shall be offset at a ratio greater than one to one. (b)(2) Emissions increases for ozone nonat tainment areas shall be offset for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and NO X in accordance with the following table: Designation Offset ratios Subpart I >1 to 1 Marginal 1.1 to 1 Moderate 1.15 to 1 Serious 1.2 to 1 Severe 1.3 to 1 Extreme 1.5 to 1 (viii) Credit for an emissions reduction can be claimed to the extent that the Department has not relied on it in issuing any permit under regulations approved pursuant to 40 CFR Part 51 Subpart I or the Department has not relied on it in demonstrating attainment or reasonable further progress. (ix) [Reserved] (x) [Reserved] (xi) The total tonnage of increased emissions, in tpy, resulting from a major modification that must be offset in accordance with section 173 of the Clean Air Act shall be determined by summing the difference between the allowable emissions after the modification (as defined by paragraph (b)(3) of Standard 7) and the actual emissions before the modification (as defined in paragraph (c)(1)) for each emissions unit. (D) The emission offsets must provide a positive net air quality benefit in the affected area as determined by 40 CFR 51, Appendix S, Emission Offset Interpretative Ruling . (E) Alternative Sites Analysis. An analysis of alternative sites, sizes, production processes, and environmental control techniques for such proposed source demonstrates that benefits of the proposed source significantly outweigh the environmental and social costs imposed as a result of its location, construction, or modification shall be required. (H) Interpollutant offsetting. (1) In meeting the emissions offset requirements of Section (D) the emissions offsets obtained shall be for the same regulated NSR pollutant unless interpollutant offsetting is permitted for a particular pollutant as specified in this paragraph. (a) The offset requirement(s) of Section (D) for emissions of the ozone precursors NO X and VOC may be satisfied by offsetting reductions of emissions of either of those precursors, if all other requirements for such offsets are also satisfied. (b) The offset requirements of Section (D) for direct PM 2.5 emissions or emissions of precursors of PM 2.5 may be satisfied by offsetting reductions of direct PM 2.5 emissions or e missions of any PM 2.5 precursor identified under paragraph (B)(32)(c) if such offsets comply with the interprecursor trading hierarchy and ratio established in the approved plan for a particular nonattainment area. (2) The control requirements applicable to major stationary sources and major modifications of PM 2.5 shall also apply to major stationary sources and major modifications of PM 2.5 precursors in a PM 2.5 nonattainment area, except that the Department may exempt new major stationary sources and maj or modifications of a particular precursor from the requirements for PM 2.5 if the nonattainment NSR precursor demonstration submitted to and approved by the Administrator shows that such sources do not contribute significantly to PM 2.5 levels that exceed t he standard in the area. Any demonstration submitted for the Administrator's review must meet the conditions for a nonattainment NSR precursor demonstration as set forth in 40 CFR 51.1006(a)(3). (I) Banking of emission offsets. For new sources obtaining p ermits by applying offsets after January 16, 1979, the Department may allow offsets that exceed the requirement of reasonable progress toward attainment to be \"banked\" (i.e., saved to provide offsets for a source seeking a permit in the future) for future use. Likewise, the Department may allow the owner of an existing source that reduces its own emissions to bank any resulting reductions beyond those required by the State Implementation Plan for future use. (J) [Reserved] (K) [Reserved] (L) Source oblig ation. (2)(A) (1) Any owner or operator who constructs or operates a source or modification not in accordance with the application submitted pursuant to this section or with the terms of any approval to construct, or any owner or operator of a source or modification subjec t to this section who commences construction after the effective date of these regulations without applying for and receiving approval hereunder, shall be subject to appropriate enforcement action. (B)(2) Approval to construct shall become invalid if con struction is not commenced within eighteen ( 18) months after receipt of such approval, if construction is discontinued for a period of eighteen ( 18) months or more, or if construction is not completed within a reasonable time. The Department may extend the eighteen ( 18)-month period upon a satisfactory showing that an extension is justified. This provision does not apply to the time period between construction of the approved phases of a phased construction project; each phase must commence construction wit hin eighteen ( 18) months of the projected and approved commencement date. (C)(3) Approval to construct shall not relieve any owner or operator of the responsibility to comply fully with applicable provisions of the plan State Implementation Plan and any other requirements under local, state, or federal law. (D)(4) At such time that a particular source or modification becomes a major stationary source or major modification solely by virtue of a relaxation in any enforcement limitation which was establish ed after August 7, 1980, on the capacity of the source or modification otherwise to emit a pollutant, such as a restriction on hours of operation, then the requirements of regulations approved pursuant to this section shall apply to the source or modificat ion as though construction had not yet commenced on the source or modification; (3)(5) Monitoring, Recordkeeping, and Reporting. The following provisions apply to with respect to any regulated NSR pollutant emitted from projects at existing emissions uni ts at a major stationary source (other than projects at a source with a PAL) in circumstances where there is a reasonable possibility that a project that is not a part of a major modification may result in a significant emissions increase of such pollutant , and the owner or operator elects to use the method specified in paragraphs (c)(11)(B)(i) (B)(31)(b)(i) through (iii)(B)(31)(b)(iii) for calculating projected actual emissions. (A)(a) If the project requires construction permitting under Regulation 61 -62.1, Section II \" Permit Requirements, \" the owner or operator shall provide a copy of the information set out in paragraph (d)(3)(B) (L)(5)(b) as part of the permit application to the Department. If construction permitting under Regulation 61 -62.1, Section II \"Permit Requirements, \" is not required, the owner or operator shall maintain the information set out in paragraph (d)(3) (L)(5) . (B)(b) Before beginning actual construction of the project, the owner or operator shall document and maintain a record of the following information: (i) A description of the project; (ii) Identification of the emissions unit(s) whose emissions of a regul ated NSR pollutant could be affected by the project; and (iii) A description of the applicability test used to determine that the project is not a major modification for any regulated NSR pollutant, including the baseline actual emissions, the projecte d actual emissions, the amount of emissions excluded under paragraph (c)(11)(B)(iii) (B)(31)(b)(iii) and an explanation for why such amount was excluded, and any netting calculations, if applicable. (c) If the emissions unit is an existing electric utility steam generating unit, before beginning actual construction, the owner or operator shall provide a copy of the information set out in paragraph (L)(5)(b) to the reviewing authority. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to require the owner or operator of such a unit to obtain any determination from the reviewing authority before beginning actual construction. (C)(d) The owner or operator shall monitor the emissions of any regulated NSR pollutant that could increase as a result of the proj ect and that is emitted by any emissions units identified in paragraph (d)(3)(B)(ii) (L)(5)(b)(ii) ; and calculate and maintain a record of the annual emissions, in tpy tons per year on a calendar year basis, for a period of five ( 5) years following resumpti on of regular operations after the change, or for a period of ten (10) years following resumption of regular operations after the change if the project increases the design capacity or potential to emit of that regulated NSR pollutant at such emissions unit. (D)(e) If the unit is an existing electric utility steam generating unit, the owner or operator shall submit a report to the Department within sixty ( 60) days after the end of each year during which records must be generated under paragraph (d)(3)(B) (L)(5)(b) setting out the unit's annual emissions during the year that preceded submission of the report. (E)(f) If the unit is an existing unit other than an electric utility steam generating unit, the owner or operator shall submit a report to the Department if the annual emissions, in tpy tons per year , from the project identified in paragraph (d)(3)(B) (L)(5)(b) , exceed the baseline actual emissions (as documented and maintained pursuant to paragraph (d)(3)(B)(iii) (L)(5)(b)(iii) , by a significant amount (as defined in paragraph (c)(14) (B)(37) ) for that regulated NSR pollutant, and if such emissions differ from the preconstruction projection as documented and maintained pursuant to paragraph (d)(3)(B)(iii) (L)(5)(b)(iii) . Such report shall be submitted to the Department within sixty ( 60) days after the end of such year. The report shall contain the following: (i) The name, address and telephone number of the major stationary source; (ii) The annual emissions as calculated pursuant to paragraph (d)(3)(C) (L)(5)(d) ; and (iii) Any other information needed for to make a compliance determination ( for example , an explanation as to why the emissions differ from the preconstruction projection). (6) A \"reasonable possibility\" under paragraph (L)(5) occurs when the owner or operator calculates the project to result in either: (a) A projected actual emissions increase of at least fifty (50) percent of the amount that is a \"significant emissions increase,\" as defined under paragraph (B)(38) (without reference to the amount that is a significant net emissions increase), for the regulated NSR pollutant; or (b) A projected actual emissions increase that, added to the amount of emissions excluded under paragraph (B)(31)(b)(iii), sums to at least fifty (50) percent of the amount that is a \"significant emissions increase,\" as defined under paragraph (B)(38) (without reference to the amount that is a significant net emissions increase), for the regulated NSR pollutant. For a project for which a reasonable possibility occurs only within the meaning of this paragraph, and not also within the meaning of paragraph (L)(6)( a), then provisions (L)(5)(c) through (L)(5)(f) do not apply to the project. (4) If a project at a source with a PAL requires construction permitting under Regulation 61 -62.1, Section II, \" Permit Requirements, \" the owner or operator shall provide notifi cation of source status as part of the permit application to the Department. (5)(7) The owner or operator of the source shall make the information required to be documented and maintained pursuant to paragraph (d)(3) (L)(5) for review upon a request for i nspection by the Department or the general public pursuant to the requirements contained in 40 CFR 70.4(b)(3)(viii).

(iii)(c) Any physical change in or change in the method of operation of a major stationary source that maintains its total source -wide emissions below the PAL level, meets the requirements in paragraphs (i)(1) (N)(1) through (15)(N)(15) , and complies wit h the PAL permit: (A)(i) Is not a major modification for the PAL pollutant; (B)(ii) Does not have to be approved through Regulation 61 -62.5, Standard 7.1, \" Nonattainment New Source Review \"; however, will be reviewed through Regulation 61 -62.1, Sect ion II , A. \"Permit Requirements, \" and (C)(iii) Is not subject to the provisions in paragraph (d)(2)(D) (L)(4) (restrictions on relaxing enforceable emission limitations that the major stationary source used to avoid applicability of the nonattainment major NSR program). (iv)(d) Except as provided under paragraph (i)(1)(iii)(C) (N)(1)(c)(iii) , a major stationary source shall continue to comply with all applicable federal or state requirements, emission limitations, and work practice requirements that were established prior to the effective date of the PAL. (2) Definitions. The definitions in paragraphs (i)(2)(i )(N)(2)(a) through (xi)(N)(2)(k) shall apply to actuals PALs consistent with paragraphs (i)(1) (N)(1) through (15)(N)(15) . When a term is not defined in these paragraphs, it shall have the meaning given in paragraph Section (c)(B) of this regulation; paragra ph (b) of Regulation 61 -62.5, Standard 7, \" Prevention of Significant Deterioration\"(\"Standard 7\"); or in the Clean Air Act. (i)(a) Actuals PAL for a major stationary source means a PAL based on the baseline actual emissions (as defined in paragraph (c)(1)(B)(3) ) of all emissions units (as defined in paragraph (b)(20) of Standard 7 (B)(16) of this regulation ) at the source, that emit or have the potential to emit the PAL pollutant. (ii)(b) Allowable emissions means \"allowable emissions\" as defined in paragraph (b)(3) of Standard 7 (B)(2) of this regulation , except as this definition is modified according to paragraphs (i)(2)(ii)(A) (N)(2)(b)(i) through (B)(N)(2)(b)(ii) . (A)(i) The allowable emissions for an y emissions unit shall be calculated considering any emission limitations that are enforceable as a practical matter on the emissions unit's potential to emit. (B)(ii) An emissions unit's potential to emit shall be determined using the definition in pa ragraph (b)(37) of Standard 7 (B)(27) , except that the words \"or enforceable as a practical matter\" should be added after \"federally enforceable.\" (iii)(c) Small emissions unit means an emissions unit that emits or has the potential to emit the PAL pollutant in an amount less than the significant level for that PAL pollutant, as defined in paragraph (c)(14) (B)(37) or in the Clean Air Act, whichever is lower. (iv)(d) Major emissions unit means: (A)(i) Any emissions unit that emits or has the potential to emit one-hundred ( 100) tpy tons per year or more of the PAL pollutant in an attainment area; or (B)(ii) Any emissions unit that emits or has the potential to emit the PAL pollutant in an amount that is equal to or greater than the major source threshold for the PAL pollutant as defined by the Clean Air Act for nonattainment areas. For example, in accordance with the definition of major stationary source in section Section 182(c) of the Clean Air Act , an emissions unit would be a major emissions unit for VOC if the emissions unit is located in a serious ozone nonattainment area and it emits or has the potential to emit fifty ( 50) or more tons of VOC per year. (v)(e) Plantwide applicability limitati on (PAL) means an emission limitation expressed in tpy tons per year , for a pollutant at a major stationary source, that is enforceable as a practical matter and established source -wide in accordance with paragraphs (i)(1) (N)(1) through (15)(N)(15) . (vi)(f) PAL effective date generally means the date of issuance of the PAL permit. However, the PAL effective date for an increased PAL is the date any emissions unit which is part of the PAL major modification becomes operational and begins to emit the PAL p ollutant. (vii)(g) PAL effective period means the period beginning with the PAL effective date and ending ten (10) years later. (viii) (h) PAL major modification means, notwithstanding paragraphs (c)(6) (B)(21) and (8)(B)(24) (the definitions for major modification and net emissions increase), any physical change in or change in the method of operation of the PAL source that causes it to emit the PAL pollutant at a level equal to or greater than the PAL. (ix)(i) PAL permit means the major NSR permit, the minor NSR permit, or the State operating permit under Regulation 61 -62.1 Section II G(G), or the Title V permit issued by the Department that establishes a PAL for a major stationary source. (x)(j) PAL pollutant means the pollutant for which a PAL is established at a major stationary source. (xi)(k) Significant emissions unit means an emissions unit that emits or has the potential to emit a PAL pollutant in an amount that is equal to or greater than the significant leve l (as defined in paragraph (c)(13) (B)(37) or in the Clean Air Act, whichever is lower) for that PAL pollutant, but less than the amount that would qualify the unit as a major emissions unit as defined in paragraph (i)(2)(iv) (N)(2)(d) . (3) Permit application requirements . As part of a permit application requesting a PAL, the owner or operator of a major stationary source shall submit the following information to the Department for approval: (i)(a) A list of all emissions units at the source desi gnated as small, significant , or major based on their potential to emit. In addition, the owner or operator of the source shall indicate which, if any, Federal or State applicable requirements, emission limitations or work practices apply to each unit. (ii)(b) Calculations of the baseline actual emissions (with supporting documentation). Baseline actual emissions are to include emissions associated not only with operation of the unit, but also emissions associated with startup, shutdown , and malfunction. (iii)(c) The calculation procedures that the major stationary source owner or operator proposes to use to convert the monitoring system data to monthly emissions and annual emissions based on a twelve ( 12) month rolling total for each month as required by paragraph (i)(13)(i) (N)(13)(a) . (4) General requirements for establishing PALs . (i)(a) The Department is allowed to establish a PAL at a major stationary source, provided that at a minimum, the requirements in paragraphs (i)(4)(i)(A) (N)(4)(a)(i) through (G)(N)(4)(a)(vii) are met. (A)(i) The PAL shall impose an annual emission limitation in tpy tons per year that is enforceable as a practical matter, for the entire major stationary source. For each month during the PAL effective period after t he first twelve ( 12) months of establishing a PAL, the major stationary source owner or operator shall show that the sum of the monthly emissions from each emissions unit under the PAL for the previous twelve (12) consecutive months is less than the PAL (a twelve ( 12) month average, rolled monthly). For each month during the first eleven ( 11) months from the PAL effective date, the major stationary source owner or operator shall show that the sum of the preceding monthly emissions from the PAL effective dat e for each emissions unit under the PAL is less than the PAL. (B)(ii) The PAL shall be established in a PAL permit that meets the public participation requirements in paragraph (i)(5) (N)(5) (C)(iii) The PAL permit shall contain all the requirements of paragraph (i)(7) (N)(7) (D)(iv) The PAL shall include fugitive emissions, to the extent quantifiable, from all emissions units that emit or have the potential to emit the PAL pollutant at the major stationary source. (E)(v) Each PAL shall regulate emissions of only one pollutant. (F)(vi) Each PAL shall have a PAL effective period of ten (10) years. (G)(vii) The owner or operator of the major stationary source with a PAL shall comply with the monitoring, recordkeeping , and reporting requirements provided in paragraphs (i)(12) (N)(12) through (14)(N)(14) for each emissions unit under the PAL through the PAL effective period. (ii)(b) At no time (during or after the PAL effective period) are emissions reductions of a PAL pollutant, which occur during the PAL effective period, creditable as decreases for purposes of offsets under paragraph (d)(1)(c) Section (D) Offset standards unless t he level of the PAL is reduced by the amount of such emissions reductions and such reductions would be creditable in the absence of the PAL. (5) Public participation requirement for PALs . PALs for existing major stationary sources shall be established, r enewed, or increased through a procedure that is consistent with paragraph (d)(6) and (d)(7) .Section M. This includes the requirement that the Department provide the public with notice of the proposed approval of a PAL permit and at least a thirty (30) -day period for submittal of public comment. The Department must address all material comments before taking final action on the permit. (6) Setting the 10 -year actuals PAL level . (i)(a) Except as provided in paragraph (i)(6)(ii) (N)(6)(b) , the actuals PAL level for a major stationary source shall be established as the sum of the baseline actual emissions (as defined in paragraph (c)(2) (B)(3) ) of the PAL pollutant for each emissions unit at the source; plus an amount equal to the applicable significant level for the PAL pollutant under paragraph (c)(14) (B)(37) or under the Clean Air Act, whichever is lower. When establishing the actuals PAL level, for a PAL pollutant, only one consecutive twenty -four ( 24)-month period must be used to determi ne the baseline actual emissions for all existing emissions units. However, a different consecutive twenty -four ( 24)-month period may be used for each different PAL pollutant. Emissions associated with units that were permanently shut down after this twent y-four ( 24)-month period must be subtracted from the PAL level. The Department shall specify a reduced PAL level(s) (in tons/yr) in tons per year in the PAL permit to become effective on the future compliance date(s) of any applicable federal or state regu latory requirement(s) that the Department is aware of prior to issuance of the PAL permit. For instance, if the source owner or operator will be required to reduce emissions from industrial boilers in half from baseline emissions of sixty ( 60) ppm NO X to a new rule limit of thirty ( 30) ppm, then the permit shall contain a future effective PAL level that is equal to the current PAL level reduced by half of the original baseline emissions of such unit(s). (ii)(b) For newly constructed units (which do not include modifications to existing units) on which actual construction began after the twenty -four ( 24)-month period the emissions must be added to the PAL level in an amount equal to the potential to emit of the u nits. (7) Contents of the PAL permit . The PAL permit must contain, at a minimum, the information in paragraphs (i)(7)(i) (N)(7)(a) through (x)(N)(7)(j) . (i)(a) The PAL pollutant and the applicable source -wide emission limitation in tpy tons per year . (ii)(b) The PAL permit effective date and the expiration date of the PAL (PAL effective period). (iii)(c) Specification in the PAL permit that if a major stationary source owner or operator applies to renew a PAL in accordance with paragraph (i)(10) (N)(10) before the end of the PAL effective period, then the PAL shall not expire at the end of the PAL effective period. It shall remain in effect until a revised PAL permit is issued by the Department. (iv)(d) A requirement that emission calculations for compliance purposes include emissions from startups, shutdowns , and malfunctions. (v)(e) A requirement that, once the PAL expires, the major stationary source is subject to the requirements of paragraph (i)(9)(N)(9) . (vi)(f) The calculation procedures that the major stationary source owner or operator shall use to convert the monitoring system data to monthly emissions and annual emissions based on a twelve ( 12) month rolling total for each month as requ ired by paragraph (i)(13)(i) (N)(13)(a) . (vii)(g) A requirement that the major stationary source owner or operator monitor all emissions units in accordance with the provisions under paragraph (i)(12) (N)(12) . (viii) (h) A requirement to retain the reco rds required under paragraph (i)(13) (N)(13) on site. Such records may be retained in an electronic format. (ix)(i) A requirement to submit the reports required under paragraph (i)(14) (N)(14) by the required deadlines. (x)(j) Any other requirements th at the Department deems necessary to implement and enforce the PAL. (8) PAL effective period and reopening of the PAL permit . The requirements in paragraphs (i)(8)(i) (N)(8)(a) and (ii)(N)(8)(b) apply to actuals PALs. (i)(a) PAL effective period . The Department shall specify a PAL effective period of ten (10) years. (ii)(b) Reopening of the PAL permit . (A)(i) During the PAL effective period, the Department must reopen the PAL permit to: (1) Correct typographical/calculation errors made in setting the PAL or reflect a more accurate determination of emissions used to establish the PAL. (2) Reduce the PAL if the owner or operator of the major stationary source creates creditable emissions reductions for use as offsets under paragraph (d)(2) Section (D) . (3) Revise the PAL to reflect an increase in the PAL as provided under paragraph (i)(11) (N)(11) . (B)(ii) The Department shall have discretion to reopen the PAL permit for the following: (1) Reduce the PAL to reflect newly applicable federal requirements (for example, NSPS) with compliance dates after the PAL effective date. (2) Reduce the PAL consistent with any other requirement, that is enforceable as a practical matter, and that the Department may impose on the majo r stationary source under the State Implementation Plan. (3) Reduce the PAL if the Department determines that a reduction is necessary to avoid causing or contributing to a NAAQS or PSD increment violation, or to an adverse impact on an air quality re lated value that has been identified for a Federal Class I area by a Federal Land Manager and for which information is available to the general public. (C)(iii) Except for the permit reopening in paragraph (i)(8)(ii)(A)(1) (N)(8)(b)(i)(1) for the correction of typographical/calculation errors that do not increase the PAL level, all other reopenings shall be carried out in accordance with the public participation requirements of paragraph (i)(5) (N)(5) (9) Expiration of a PAL . Any PAL whic h is not renewed in accordance with the procedures in paragraph (i)(10) (N)(10) shall expire at the end of the PAL effective period, and the requirements in paragraphs (i)(9)(i) (N)(9)(a) through (v)(N)(9)(e) shall apply. (i)(a) Each emissions unit (or ea ch group of emissions units) that existed under the PAL shall comply with an allowable emission limitation under a revised permit established according to the procedures in paragraphs (i)(9)(i)(A) (N)(9)(a)(i) through (B)(N)(9)(a)(ii) . (A)(i) Within the time frame specified for PAL renewals in paragraph (i)(10)(ii) (N)(10)(b) , the major stationary source shall submit a proposed allowable emission limitation for each emissions unit (or each group of emissions units, if such a distribution is more appropria te as decided by the Department) by distributing the PAL allowable emissions for the major stationary source among each of the emissions units that existed under the PAL. If the PAL had not yet been adjusted for an applicable requirement that became effect ive during the PAL effective period, as required under paragraph (i)(10)(v) (N)(10)(e) , such distribution shall be made as if the PAL had been adjusted. (B)(ii) The Department shall decide whether and how the PAL allowable emissions will be distributed and issue a revised permit incorporating allowable limits for each emissions unit, or each group of emissions units, as the Department determines is appropriate. (ii)(b) Each emissions unit(s) shall comply with the allowable emission limitation on a twelve ( 12) month rolling basis. The Department may approve the use of monitoring systems (source testing, emission factors, etc.) other than Continuous Emissions Monitoring System (CEMS), Continuous Emissions Rate Monitoring System (CERMS), Predictive Emissions Moni toring System (PEMS), or Continuous Parameter Monitoring System (CPMS) to demonstrate compliance with the allowable emission limitation. (iii)(c) Until the Department issues the revised permit incorporating allowable limits for each emissions unit, or e ach group of emissions units, as required under paragraph (i)(9)(i)(A) (N)(9)(a)(i) , the source shall continue to comply with a source -wide, multi -unit emissions cap equivalent to the level of the PAL emission limitation. (iv)(d) Any physical change or c hange in the method of operation at the major stationary source will be subject to the nonattainment major NSR requirements if such change meets the definition of major modification in paragraph (c)(6) (B)(21) . (v)(e) The major stationary source owner or operator shall continue to comply with any State or Federal applicable requirements (BACT, RACT, NSPS, etc.) that may have applied either during the PAL effective period or prior to the PAL effective period except for those emission limitations that had b een established pursuant to paragraph (d)(2)(D) (L)(4) , but were eliminated by the PAL in accordance with the provisions in paragraph (i)(1)(iii)(C) (N)(1)(c)(iii) . (10) Renewal of a PAL . (i)(a) The Department shall follow the procedures specified in paragraph (i)(5) (N)(5) in approving any request to renew a PAL for a major stationary source, and shall provide both the proposed PAL level and a written rationale for the proposed PAL level to the p ublic for review and comment. During such public review, any person may propose a PAL level for the source for consideration by the Department. (ii)(b) Application deadline . A major stationary source owner or operator shall submit a timely application t o the Department to request renewal of a PAL. A timely application is one that is submitted at least six (6) months prior to, but not earlier than eighteen ( 18) months from, the date of permit expiration. This deadline for application submittal is to ensure that the permit will not expire before the permit is renewed. If the owner or operator of a major stationary source submits a complete application to renew th e PAL within this time period, then the PAL shall continue to be effective until the revised permit with the renewed PAL is issued. (iii)(c) Application requirements . The application to renew a PAL permit shall contain the information required in paragr aphs (i)(10)(iii)(A) (N)(10)(c)(i) through (iii)(N)(3)(c) . (B)(ii) A proposed PAL level. (C)(iii) The sum of the potential to emit of all emissions units under the PAL (with supporting documentation). (D)(iv) Any other information the owner or operator wishes the Department to consider in determining the appropriate level for renewing the PAL. (iv)(d) PAL adjustment . In determining whether and how to adjust the PAL, the Department shall consider the options outlined in paragraphs (i)(10)(iv)(A) (N)(10)(d)(i) and (B)(N)(10)(d)(ii) . However, in no case may any such adjustment fail to comply with paragraph (i)(10)(iv)(C) (N)(10)(d)(iii) . (A)(i) If the emissions level calculated in accordance with paragraph (i)(6) (N)(6) is equal to or greater than eighty ( 80) percent of the PAL level, the Department may renew the PAL at the same level without considering the factors set forth in paragraph (i)(10)(iv)(B) (N)(10)(d)(ii) ; or (B)(ii) The Department may set the PAL at a level that it determines to be more representative of the source's baseline actual emissions, or that it determines to be appropriate considering air qualit y needs, advances in control technology, anticipated economic growth in the area, desire to reward or encourage the source's voluntary emissions reductions, or other factors as specifically identified by the Department in its written rationale. (C)(iii) Notwithstanding paragraphs (i)(10)(iv)(A) (N)(10)(d)(i) and (B)(N)(10)(d)(ii) , (1) If the potential to emit of the major stationary source is less than the PAL, the Department shall adjust the PAL to a level no greater than the potential to emit of t he source; and (2) The Department shall not approve a renewed PAL level higher than the current PAL, unless the major stationary source has complied with the provisions of paragraph (i)(11) (N)(11) (increasing a PAL). (v)(e) If the compliance date for a state or federal requirement that applies to the PAL source occurs during the PAL effective period, and if the Department has not already adjusted for such requirement, the PAL shall be adjusted at the time of PAL permit renew al or Title V permit renewal, whichever occurs first. (11) Increasing a PAL during the PAL effective period. (i)(a) The Department may increase a PAL emission limitation only if the major stationary source complies with the provisions in paragraphs (i)(11)(i)(A) (N)(11)(a)(i) through (D)(N)(11)(a)(iv) . (A)(i) The owner or operator of the major stationary source shall submit a complete application to request an increase in the PAL limit for a PAL major modification. Such application shall identify th e emissions unit(s) contributing to the increase in emissions so as to cause the major stationary source's emissions to equal or exceed its PAL. (B)(ii) As part of this application, the major stationary source owner or operator shall demonstrate that t he sum of the baseline actual emissions of the small emissions units, plus the sum of the baseline actual emissions of the significant and major emissions units assuming application of BACT equivalent controls, plus the sum of the allowable emissions of th e new or modified emissions unit(s) exceeds the PAL. The level of control that would result from BACT equivalent controls on each significant or major emissions unit shall be determined by conducting a new BACT analysis at the time the application is submi tted, unless the emissions unit is currently required to comply with a BACT or LAER requirement that was established within the preceding ten (10) years. In such a case, the assumed control level for that emissions unit shall be equal to the level of BACT or LAER with which that emissions unit must currently comply. (C)(iii) The owner or operator obtains a major NSR permit for all emissions unit(s) identified in paragraph (i)(11)(i)(A) (N)(11)(a)(i) , regardless of the magnitude of the emissions increase resulting from them (that is, no significant levels apply). These emissions unit(s) shall comply with any emissions requirements resulting from the nonattainment major NSR program process (for example, LAER), even though they have also become subject to th e PAL or continue to be subject to the PAL. (D)(iv) The PAL permit shall require that the increased PAL level shall be effective on the day any emissions unit that is part of the PAL major modification becomes operational and begins to emit the PAL pollutant. (ii)(b) The Department shall calculate the new PAL as the sum of the allowable emissions for each modified or new emissions unit, plus the sum of the baseline actual emissions of the significant and major emissions units (assuming application of BACT equivalent controls as determined in accordance with paragraph (i)(11)(i)(B) (N)(11)(a)(ii) ), plus the sum of the baseline actual emissions of the small emissions units. (iii)(c) The PAL permit shall be revised to reflect the increased PAL level pursuant to the public notice requirements of paragraph (i)(5) (N)(5) . (12) Monitoring requirements for PALs . (i)(a) General Requirements. (A)(i) Each PAL permit must contain enfor ceable requirements for the monitoring system that accurately determines plantwide emissions of the PAL pollutant in terms of mass per unit of time. Any monitoring system authorized for use in the PAL permit must be based on sound science and meet generall y acceptable scientific procedures for data quality and manipulation. Additionally, the information generated by such system must meet minimum legal requirements for admissibility in a judicial proceeding to enforce the PAL permit. (B)(ii) The PAL moni toring system must employ one or more of the four general monitoring approaches meeting the minimum requirements set forth in paragraphs (i)(12)(ii)(A) (N)(12)(b)(i) through (D)(N)(12)(b)(iv) and must be approved by the Department.

(iv)(d) CEMS. An owner or operator using CEMS to monitor PAL pollutant emissions shall meet the following requirements: (A)(i) CEMS must comply with applicable Performance Specifications found in 40 CFR Part 60, Appendix B; and (B)(ii) CEMS must sample, analyze and record data at least every fifteen ( 15) minutes while the emissions unit is operating. (v)(e) CPMS or PEMS. An owner or operator using CPMS or PEMS to monitor PAL pollutant emissions shall meet the following requirements: (A)(i) The CPMS or the PEMS must be based on current site -specific data demonstrating a correlation between the monitored p arameter(s) and the PAL pollutant emissions across the range of operation of the emissions unit; and (B)(ii) Each CPMS or PEMS must sample, analyze, and record data at least every fifteen ( 15) minutes, or at another less frequent interval approved by the Department, while the emissions unit is operating. (vi)(f) Emission factors. An owner or operator using emission factors to monitor PAL pollutant emissions shall meet the following requireme nts: (A)(i) All emission factors shall be adjusted, if appropriate, to account for the degree of uncertainty or limitations in the factors' development; (B)(ii) The emissions unit shall operate within the designated range of use for the emission fa ctor, if applicable; and (C)(iii) If technically practicable, the owner or operator of a significant emissions unit that relies on an emission factor to calculate PAL pollutant emissions shall conduct validation testing to determine a site-specific emi ssion factor within six ( 6) months of PAL permit issuance, unless the Department determines that testing is not required. (vii)(g) A source owner or operator must record and report maximum potential emissions without considering enforceable emission lim itations or operational restrictions for an emissions unit during any period of time that there is no monitoring data, unless another method for determining emissions during such periods is specified in the PAL permit. (viii) (h) Notwithstanding the requ irements in paragraphs (i)(12)(iii) (N)(12)(c) through (vii)(N)(12)(g) , where an owner or operator of an emissions unit cannot demonstrate a correlation between the monitored parameter(s) and the PAL pollutant emissions rate at all operating points of the e missions unit, the Department shall, at the time of permit issuance: (A)(i) Establish default value(s) for determining compliance with the PAL based on the highest potential emissions reasonably estimated at such operating point(s); or (B)(ii) Determine that operation of the emissions unit during operating conditions when there is no correlation between monitored parameter(s) and the PAL pollutant emissions is a violation of the PAL. (ix)(i) Re-validation. All data used to establish the PAL pollu tant must be re -validated through performance testing or other scientifically valid means approved by the Department. Such testing must occur at least once every five ( 5) years after issuance of the PAL. (13) Recordkeeping requirements .
