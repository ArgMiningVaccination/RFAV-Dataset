How does a vacation help heal and transform us? Here we look at some of the vital ingredients that make Peru such an important place for sacred travel, healing, and transformation. Sacred Medicine - San Pedro (Wachuma) San Pedro (also known as Wachuma) is a sacred cactus native to the Andean mountains of Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador. Along with Tobacco, Ayahuasca, and Coca, it is one of Peru's most sacred plants, and has been used for over 4,000 years to heal and expand consciousness. The medicine is typically prepared as a tea; pieces of the stem are boiled for a few hours, and once the liquid is cooled it is taken orally. It is known as a gentle but powerful Masculine teacher plant, and can be used as a tool for meditation and self-awareness. It is very important to work with this medicine as part of a sacred ceremony led by an experienced Healer or Medicine Man/Woman, and with the protection of the ancestral spirits.

Machu Picchu, the 15th century Inca site, majestically perched above the Sacred Valley, is one of those energetically powerful sites, and an important part of any visit to Peru. Because it sits within three corresponding high peaks of power, which create an energy triangle, it is a perfect spot to sit and meditate, focus your intent, and expand your awareness. There are other, lesser known, sites in Peru that will also lead you towards a profound connection with ancestral wisdom and your own true self. At Raqchi, also known as the Temple of Wiracocha, the God Creator of the Andes, you can find your centre and point of connection to the divine origins - with the help of a good teacher and guide. The powerful site of Cutimbo (Kutimpuy), an archaeological complex characterized by its \"chullpas\" or burial towers, located a short distance from Puno, at an altitude of 4023 metres above sea level, is similarly transformative. The name Cutimbo in Quechua means to come back to your essence of being a medicine man or medicine woman, which makes it an excellent power place to reconnect with ancestral Lemurian lineages and sacred medicine that our ancestors left for the awakening of consciousness in this new era. Traditionally, it was only the best spiritual leaders who were taken here to become eternal guardians of the lineage of light, and the buildings themselves were giant cups offering only the best medicine for the Gods. Energy Work with Healers For a truly satisfying travel experience to Peru you will need a good tour guide and teacher who can guide you through the sacred sites as well as introduce you to energy work and healing opportunities. Ideally, you will want to participate in a Despacho Ceremony as well as experience traditional teachings with healers and medicine men or women. These ceremonies and energy work will help you to further connect to Peru and its transformative power, and will lead you towards liberation from heavy energy towards a place of clarity, peace, and happiness within yourself. Authentically Experiencing Other Ways of Life In order to move beyond feeling like a tourist in Peru, it can be helpful to immerse yourself in the local culture, meet with local people, and experience day-to-day living. This can be done in places such as the village of Chinchero, with spectacular views over the Sacred Valley and famed for its traditional weavings - especially with a guide who has personal connections to this, or other, villages. Or a homestay on the Uros Islands can provide the perfect environment for learning about the local culture and traditions, and making an authentic connection to the Uros people who, according to legend, existed before the sun when the earth was cold and dark. Connecting with the Natural Environment in Peru As well as the power places and sacred sites, Peru also features a wealth of wildlife and stunning natural scenery. From the tranquil waters of Lake Titicaca to the beauty of the Sacred Valley and the snow-peaked mountains and majestic valleys surrounding Apu Salkantay, Peru is, quite simply, breathtaking. Imagine watching condors, the Gods of the Andes, in their native, wilderness environment, witnessing the majestic flight of these huge Sacred Birds of the Incas as well as many other birds including eagles and hawks. Imagine being in the presence of the whitetail deer, the Andean fox, and the rabbit-like Chinchilla, the Viscachas, and picture the heart-centered tranquility of a moment where time stands still and you're fully captivated by the natural environment around you. Are you looking for a journey that contains a mix of all these vital ingredients? A travel experience that will feel incredibly satisfying as you connect with the earth around you, feel the energy from the sacred sites, and learn so much from your time with the local people and your tour leaders, and from which you will return happier, healthier in mind and body, and forever changed from your experiences?
