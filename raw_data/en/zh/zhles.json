Whereas, de novo SBD is rarely used, most reports on SBD are dealing with the optimization of an initial hit discovered by other means. Dynamic combinatorial chemistry has emerged as a powerful strategy to identify ligands for biological targets. In a dynamic combinatorial library (DCL), the connection bonds between the building blocks are reversible and continuously being made and broken. The composition of a DCL will respond to the addition of a target protein that selectively binds one or more library members and will extract such member(s) from the DCL. Here, we have demonstrated that the novel combination of de novo SBD and DCC is a highly efficient hit-identification strategy. We have designed a library of potential inhibitors (acyl hydrazones) generated from 5 aldehydes and 5 hydrazides and used DCC to identify the best binder(s). Upon addition of the aspartic protease endothiapepsin, the NMR spectroscopy (STD-NMR). The ligands identified were synthesized separately and tested for their biological activity using an enzyme-based fluorescence assay and shown to have IC50 values in the double-digit micromolar range. Subsequent co-crystallization experiments validated the predicted binding mode of the two most potent inhibitors, constituting a proof of concept that the combination of de novo SBD and DCC constitutes an efficient starting point for hit identification and optimization. m.mondal@rug.nl Phenolic composition of Euphorbia macroclada by using 1Dicle University, Turkey 2Dicle University Science and Technology Research and Application Center, Turkey Euphorbia is one of the largest genus that belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, and represented by 105 species in Turkey. Euphorbia species are named as 'S\u00fctleen' and 'Xail' . These species are commonly used in Turkish folk medicine for the treatment of rheumatism, swelling as well as a wart remover. In this study, root and aerial parts (stem, leave, flower and seed) of Euphorbia macrolada were collected in its flowering period. Powdered form of the dried plant material was weighed (1 gr) and macerated with methanol (3 times 10 mL) at 25oC for 24 hours. After filtration, the solvent was evaporated to obtain the crude extracts of different parts of Euphorbia macrolada . Phenolic components in the methanol extracts were analysed qualitatively and quantitatively by a previously validated LC-MS/MS method. With this method, 27 phenolic compounds were found in the plant. yener4321@gmail.comJ "}
