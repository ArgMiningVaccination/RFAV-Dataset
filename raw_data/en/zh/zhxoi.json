It is characterized by feelings of tension, worrying, and unease which can manifest physically as sweating, trembling, racing heart rate, difficulty concentrating, and increased alertness. While these physical symptoms can be uncomfortable and distracting, it's important to remember that nerves usually indicate that a person is interested, engaged, and invested in the task at hand. Nervousness can be helpful when it's viewed as a motivator or energizer that helps you to focus your energy and stay alert while taking risks or facing challenges. The impacts can be managed through [relaxation techniques](https://mantracare.org/therapy/stress/relaxation-techniques/), such as deep breathing and visualization, which can help put you in control of the situation. In times when nervousness becomes overwhelming or difficult to manage, it may be helpful to turn to a trusted friend or professional for support and further guidance.

Exercise doesn't have to be over complicated or time-consuming; it just has to get your heart rate up. Aromatherapy One natural remedy you may want to consider is [aromatherapy](https://mantracare.org/ayurveda/aromatherapy/). Aromatherapy uses essential oils to promote relaxation and ease anxiety. Lavender oil is one of the most popular essential oils for nervousness. It's been shown to reduce stress and anxiety in several studies.

Once you're comfortable using essential oils, you can experiment with different scents and combinations to see what works best for you. Acupuncture Another popular form of natural remedy for nervousness is [acupuncture](https://mantracare.org/physiotherapy/acupuncture/). Acupuncture is based on the traditional Chinese belief that a person's health is determined by their life force, or qi (pronounced \"chee\"), which flows through pathways in the body. This ancient practice involves inserting thin needles into specific points along these pathways to stimulate the flow of qi and improve overall health. Acupuncture is said to help reduce pain, improve mood and energy levels, and promote healing by stimulating the body's natural ability to regenerate itself. It may also be used to treat a variety of conditions such as headaches, allergies, [arthritis](https://mantracare.org/physiotherapy/arthritis/), digestive issues, stress-related illnesses, and even [addiction](https://mantracare.org/therapy/addiction/addiction-meaning/). Music Therapy Another way that music [therapy](https://mantracare.org/therapy/therapist/therapy/) can help people is by providing a source of comfort. Music can provide solace and peace to those who are going through difficult times or [feeling overwhelmed](https://mantracare.org/therapy/negative-feelings/feeling-overwhelmed/). Music also can evoke certain emotions, which can be beneficial in helping a person process and cope with difficult situations. Additionally, musical activities such as singing, playing instruments, and writing lyrics can be used to express oneself and one's emotions in a safe, healthy way. Music can also provide an outlet for [creativity](https://mantracare.org/therapy/what-is/creativity/) and creative problem-solving, further helping people cope with difficult situations. Journaling Another great way to process and express your emotions is through journaling. Journaling is a great creative outlet, as it allows you to get all of your thoughts and feelings out in an organized manner. You can start writing down whatever comes to mind\u2014be it a rant, a list of things that inspire you, reflections on the day's events, or even just a reminder to yourself that everything is going to be okay. Writing your thoughts down can help you get perspective on what's causing stress and anxiety, process your emotions, and gain insight into your own life. If you're looking for further guidance on how to begin journaling, there are plenty of helpful resources online, such as a free journaling course or various books on the topic. Move Outside Another great way to relax is to spend some time outside. Getting away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life helps us to reset and recharge. Go for a walk, sit in your backyard, or take a day trip somewhere beautiful. Nature has a calming energy that can help reduce stress levels and bring you back into balance. Connecting with nature through activities like bird watching, gardening, hiking or exploring can be a great way to relax and appreciate the beauty of the world around you. Taking some time alone in nature will help clear your mind and give you perspective on any challenges you may be facing. So get out there and take advantage of all that nature has to offer. Vitamin-D Another key benefit of vitamin D is to keep your stress levels in check. Vitamin D helps regulate the hormone known as cortisol, which is released in times of stress and can cause anxiety, fatigue, and difficulty sleeping. Getting enough vitamin D can help to reduce these symptoms and keep your energy levels balanced. The best way to get vitamin D is through sensible sun exposure since the body synthesizes its vitamin D when exposed to ultraviolet (UV) rays from the sun. Aim for at least 10-15 minutes of direct, unprotected sun exposure a few times each week. You can also get vitamin D from food sources such as salmon, tuna, eggs, and mushrooms. Conclusion Natural remedies for nervousness can be a great way to reduce anxiety. From spending time in nature, drinking calming herbal teas, and practicing relaxation techniques like yoga and meditation, there are many different ways to help relax your body and mind.
