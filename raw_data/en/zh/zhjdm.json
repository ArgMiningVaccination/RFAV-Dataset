At present, there is aneed for scientific evaluation and standardization of all theseproducts. This development also concerns the use of herbal drugswith a long therapeutic tradition. With the elaboration of mono-graphs by the Herbal Medicinal Product Commission (HMPC), adecision has been made that supports further therapeutic admin-istration based on scientific evidence. One of these herbal drugs with long tradition is Tormentil derived from Potentilla erecta L., Rosaceae [1]. Alt hough there is no approved herbal drug available in European community, the drug is traditionally used and attractsattention in complementary medicine [2]. The following review focuses mainly on the biological and pharmacological effects of drug preparations with respect to theirtherapeutic use.Botanical Description Potentilla erecta is widely distributed throughout Eurasia in a variety of environments including bogs, heaths, moors, grasslands, openwoods, and alpine slopes. herbaceous perennial with a stout,hard rootstock. Procumbent and erect stems (10 -25 cm) are non- rooting, and the height is greater where the land is damp and notgrazed by sheep. The alternate leaves are unstalked, toothed at theapex, and hairy underneath. The leaves occur in groups of 3 with2 stipules that resemble small leaflets, so it appears to have 5 leaf- lets. The yellow flowers occur in summer in cymes and have 4 pet- als and many yellow stamens. There are 4 sepals and a 4-sectionedepicalyx. All other Potentilla species have 5 petals. The seed is anachene [3].

Article published online: 2020-03-10from the synonyms Potentilla tormentilla Neck. or .T h en a m eo fg e n u s \"Potentilla \"refers to the Latin word \"poten- tial\"meaning power and is related to the powerful pharmacologi- cal activity of the plant, which has been used for several indicationsin the past. In the medieval age, the traditional name \"Tormentil \" also referred to the Latin word \"tormentina \",which means intesti- nal colic and also points to the specific use of the herbal drug tocure enteritis and spasmodic colics. In the German-speaking re-gions in Europe, the name is \"Blutwurz \"and refers to the red color of the broken roots, which is the result of the formation of red-col- ored tannins and also indicates the therapeutic use for stoppingbleedings in former times [4]. Phytochemistry of the Underground Parts About 55 compounds have been described for the undergroundparts of P. erecta . With a total of 15 -20%, condensed tannins (syn. proanthocyanidins, nonhydrolyzable tannins) are the most abundant group of compounds. Monomeric, dimeric, and trimericproanthocyanidins of type B were isolated and their structureselucidated. They are usually transconfigurated and connected via4,8,4 , 6 ,6 , of a cis-configurated dimeric proanthocyanidin. The Pro- cyanidins B1, B2, and B5 were only detected in traces. Tetra-, pen- ta-, and hexamers have been also detected, but their structureswere not completely elucidated [5 -10]. The fraction of -62% monomers, pentamers and hexamers, depending on the author [9 -11]. Several precursors for condensed tannins were group of compounds [13]. Apart from pentadigalloylglucose, 1 monomeric and 3 ellagitannins group, agrimoniin ( Fig. 1 ) is one of the most representative and most complex compounds, and it isfound in many plant materials belonging to the Rosaceae family.Agrimoniin (C 82H54O52) is a dimeric ellagitannin with a of 1871.282, having 2D glucopyranose cores with -glu- cosidic linkages in both units. The absolute configuration of all 4 atropoisomeric biaryl hexahydroxydiphenoyl (HHDP) groups is S-configuration 2% (w/w) can be found inthe underground parts of P. erecta [16]. Laevitagin B and Laevita- gin F ofP. erecta [16]. The biaryl HHDP groups can also be seen as dimers of hexahydroxydiphenic acid and precursors of ellagic acid. Ellagic acid is the dilactone of hexahydroxydiphenic acid, and yields of about 0.4% can be found [16,18]. As a structural element, it is re-lated to the ellagitannins. Nine triterpenoid compounds were isolated and elucidated, generally based on an Ursan- or an Olean skeleton, and presentas aglycones a a glucopyrano- sylester, and its aglycon, Tormentic acid. the fraction of triterpens yields between 0.6 -1.7% [19,20]. Further ingredients include a series of organic acids and phenol carboxylic acids like caffeic acid, gallic acid, or salicylic acid. Someof these compounds are only present after hydrolysis of more com-plex structures [21,22]. Some flavonoids like a cyanidinglucoside,kaempferol, and leucoanthocyanidin are also present but are moreabundant in the aerial parts of P. erecta [8,12,23].

Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. Traditional Use Presumably, the plant was not used in the ancient world, but ther- apeutic reports from medieval herbal books are known [4]. In theContrafayt Kre\u00fcterbuch by Otto Brunfels (1532). Tormentilla was used for the treatment of hemorrhaging, excessive menstruation,diarrhea, or cholera [29]. Some of these indications have impor- tance until today. The use of an infusion or alcoholic extract of the drug (tincture) for the treatment of diarrhea with and withoutvomiting, enteritis, intestinal bleedings, and dysentery were re-ported as standard medicinal therapy until the middle of the20th century. The use as gargle in case of oropharyngeal inflam-mations or as a compress/ointment for wound healing in exuda-tive eczema, as well as for contusions and hematomas, has alsobeen reported and is still used today for self-medication. The dos- age ranged from 2 -4 g of the powdered drug or 15 -20 g of a de- coction of the dried rhizome. The drug has long been mono-graphed as \"Rhizoma tormentillae \"in many pharmacopeias the European Pharmacopoeia, standardized on the con-centration of tannins. In addition, there is a monograph elabo-rated by the HMPC as a drug for traditional use with 2 indications: 1. oral application of a tea or an extract preparation for sympto- matical treatment of mild diarrhea; and 2. application of an ex-tract preparation for symptomatical treatment of mild oropharyn-geal inflammations [30]. Both indications reflect the traditionaluse of the drug for more than 500 y. There is a monograph witha broad spectrum of phytochemical, pharmacological, and toxico-logical data published by the European Scientific Cooperative onPhytotherapy with nearly identical indications as those given by the HMPC monograph. In this regard, it is rather surprising that, on the European mar- ket, no approved phytotherapeutic product containing a prepara-tion of P. erecta is available, only homeopathic medicines. The rea- son for that seems to be due to the lack of a sufficient number ofconvincing clinical studies. Pharmacology The review regarding pharmacological investigations is based onan evaluation of literature collected by PubMed until December2019. Using the keywords \"Potentilla erecta \",\"Potentilla tormentil- la\",a n d \"Tormentil \", in total only 44 references were shown. The most recent article was published in July 2019. The topics de-scribe, besides phytochemical findings, mainly biological andpharmacological effects. The first articles with clear reference to human application were published in the early 1950s and describe the use of Tormentil root preparations as astringents by dentists,according to the HMPC m onograph for the ptomatic treat- ment of mild oropharyngeal inflammation [31 -33]. In vitro Investigations In addition to the reports on the use of Tormentil root prepara- tions by dentists as mentioned before, in vitro inhibitory effects of an aqueous extract against cariogenic Streptococcus spp. strainswere also investigated. It was demonstrated that the extract mod- erately inhibited the growth of oral Streptococci . The preparation exhibited inhibitory effects on water-insoluble alpha-(1,3) ,a l - pha-(1,6)-linked glucan (mutan) and artificial dental plaque for- mation. The results indicate that the extract could become a use-ful supplement for pharmaceutical products as new anticariogen-ic agent in a wide range of oral care products [34]. A possible ex-planation for this activity could be provided by studies that fo-cused on the mechanisms of the innate immune defense againstbacteria. The (pseudo)halogenating activity of lactoperoxidase(LPO) is known to be an essential part of the maintenance of oral microbiological homeostasis. Any disturbance of this system is as- sociated with oral diseases like caries or gingivitis. The LPO is re-Table 1 Compounds of the underground parts of Potentilla erecta Thieme.

An ethanolic extract of Tor-mentil and some other compounds such as ellagic acid or methylgallate were found as potent LPO-enzyme-regenerating com-pounds. These results may provide a further reason for the appli-cation of Tormentil extract, which is known for its antibacterialand anti-inflammatory, as well as plaque inhibiting, effects in the mouth [35]. In addition, the Tormentil extract processed in mu- coadhesive dosage forms was able to significantly reduce artificialbiofilm formation by cariogenic Streptococcus mutans in a porcine buccal mucosa model in vitro .F o ra l l Streptococci ,c o m p l e t ei n h i b i - tion was revealed at a final concentration of the extract of 2 mg/ml [36]. All results taken together, there is clear evidence for thebeneficial effect of Tormentil extracts used to treat bacteriosis inthe oral cavity. Interestingly, the extract is also active against some problematic gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria of the genera Azotobacter, Bacillus ,a n d Pseudomonas as well as against opportunistic pathogens like B. cereus, E. coli, P. aerugino- sa,a n d S. aureus strains [37]. A review article from 2009 summa- rizes the antibacterial activity of different preparations of P. erecta against a broad spectrum of bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa,Klebsiella pneumoniae ,a n d Helicobacter pylori . Additionally, also the methanolic extract from the aerial parts of P. erecta showed moderate antibacterial and antifungal activities against Staphylo- n d Candida krusei [8]. In accordance with the traditional use of Tormentil extract for treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), its antioxidativeeffects were studied because reactive oxygen Chemilu- minescence was used after mucosal biopsies from 23 patients with active ulcerative colitis (UC) to detect the extract se f f e c to n the generation of oxygen radicals. The Tormentil extract showed apotent antioxidative potential and superoxide-scavenging effect.The reported results indicate that a number of widely used herbalpreparations including Tormentil have antioxidant bothcell-free and mucosal biopsy assay systems. Consideration shouldbe given to formal evaluation of the therapeutic potential of Tor- mentil in patients with IBD and other chronic inflammatory condi- tions in vivo studies have and trimers) extracted from the rhizomes of P. erecta displayed the highest antioxidative activity of the possessed the most significant proper-ties extracts showed also inhibitory tosis in vitro [39]. Summarizing all these effects with respect to in- flammatory damage on skin and mucosa, the use of extracts ofP. erecta for treatment according to the HMPC m onograph is sup- ported by the in vitro investigations.Animal Studies Due to the diverse pharmacological activities of polyphenols, the polyphenol-rich Tormentil extract was shown to affect the metab-olism of arachidonic acid, and by that, it exerts both anti-inflam-matory and antioxidant activities, which also suggests a possibleeffect in thrombotic processes. In a rat model of thrombosis, a water-methanol extract from P. erecta rhizome was orally adminis- tered for 14 days in doses of 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg. The Tor- mentil extract (400 mg/kg) significantly decreased thrombusweight and prolonged the time to carotid artery occlusion andbleeding time without changes in the blood pressure. In ex vivo ex- periments, the extract (400 mg/kg) reduced thromboxane pro-duction and decreased t PA activity without changes in total t PA concentration. The authors concluded that Tormentil extract in- hibits arterial thrombosis in [40]. Whether theseeffects are mediated by polyphenols itself or by metabolites of mi-crobiota was not explained but should be investigated in future.The Tormentil extract showed also an increase of insulin secretionin a diabetic mice model after oral administration, possibly in-duced by tormentoside. The authors speculated that in an initialdiabetic stage, extracts from the drug might be used as supple- mentary treatment, helpful in prevention of diabetic complica- tions such as neuropathy and retinopathy [8]. that Tormentil rhizome extract, applied to diabeticrats in high dosage of 400 mg, showed an antithrombotic effectand inhibited primary hemostasis despite its antifibrinolytic activ-ity. The authors concluded that the extracts at that high dosagehad a beneficial effect on hemostasis, which may be the result ofa more pronounced action of urolithins -metabolites of ellagitan- nins with a proven protective effect towards endothelial cells [41]. Studies in Humans Only 4 clinical studies were published but were cited in 6 reviews on the treatment of IBD. Complementary therapies are widelyused by a majority of patients with IBD, particularly those withlong-term disorders and prior hospitalization, and the overall use has generally increased in the population in recent y [42]. Based on the traditional use of Tormentil to cure enteritis, intestinalbleedings, and dysentery and on the positive reports of individualpatients with UC who have used this drug as a complementarytherapy for chronic IBD, a Tormentil extract was investigated inpatients with active UC. The aim of this open-label, dose-escalat-ing study was to assess the safety, pharmacology, and clinical ef-fects of different doses of the used extract. Sixteen patients with active UC received an ethanolic dry extract from the rhizome of P. erecta , which contained 200 mg per capsule (15 -22% tannins besides triterpenes and flavonoids) and was licensed in Germanyfor the treatment of unspecific diarrhea until 2015. The extractwas applied in escalating doses of 1200, 1800, 2400, and3000 mg/d for 3 weeks each. Each treatment phase was followedby a 4-week washout phase. The outcome parameters were sideeffects, clinical activity index, C-reactive protein-, and tannin lev- els in patients sera. The study showed that the extract appeared safe up to a dosage of 3000 mg/day. During therapy with 1053Melzig MF, 2020. Thieme. All rights reserved.

The CAI especially decreased in allpatients, whereas it increased again during the washout phase.Tannins from the extract were not systemically absorbed. The au-thors concluded that the results were promising, but randomizedplacebo-controlled studies with endoscopic control are needed toconfirm the results [43]. This pilot-study was highlighted by theeditors of the publishing journal because of its importance for pa- tients and for clinicians examining whether complementary thera- pies are safe and benefifical. Despite a number of limitations inthis study ( e.g.small sample size, lack of documented endoscopic activity, nonspecific symptom score, and lack of meaningful sta-tistical analysis), the study provides evidence of some efficacy forTormentil extract in the treatment of symptoms of UC in patientsreceiving the conventional therapy. Although the results werepromising, they were inconclusive. Until a randomized controlled trial has been conducted and the safety and efficacy are clearly demonstrated, caution must be applied in the use of this herbaldrug in active UC [44]. Since 2007, the situation has not changed;no further clinical study has been published about Tormentil ex-tract for treatment of active UC. A review on drug-herb-interac-tions in the elderly patient with IBD refers only to the study pub-lished in 2007, stating that the exact mechanism of action is un-known. The plant is generally well tolerated, apart from a few cases of mild stomachache only. There are no known interactions with IBD drugs [45]. In comparison to a variety of other herbalproducts, Tormentil extract was assessed as the most promisingherbal product for treatment of IBD [46]. Despite the lack of clin-ical facts, Tormentil extract has been mentioned in review articlesconcerning complementary and alternative medicine for thetreatment of IBD [47 -49]. Possibly, the pharmacological effects of such tannin-rich herbal drugs, such as P. erecta ,c o u l dn o tb e convincingly explained, since the tannins are not bioavailable and thus are not absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract. The situation changed in 2014 with a publication that showed the role of human intestinal microbiota in the metabolism of ella-gitannin-rich plant material in connection with such drugs that aretraditionally used to treat inflammation in the intestine. The au-thors showed that tannins of the ellagitannin-type like agrimo-niin, as present in P. erecta , were metabolized by the microbiota after oral application and form urolithins, which show anti-inflam- matory effects in human cells [50]. These data were the \"missing link\"between pharmacological efficacy and scientific explanation of the observed effects after oral ingestion. Now agrimoniin hasreceived wide interest as a result of some interesting biological ef-fects and therapeutic activities. Local effects seem to be directlyconnected with its tannin-character. Much evidence is providedthat the systemic effects are based on the microbiotic metabo- lites, the urolithins, as they are found in micromolar concentra- tions in body fluids and tissues after ingestion of products con-taining ellagitannin [15]. Urolithin A significantly enhances thegut barrier function and inhibits unwarranted inflammation viathe activation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor-nuclear factor ery-throid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-dependent pathways that upregu-late epithelial tight junction proteins. The treatment with suchcompounds mitigated colitis in pre-clinical models by improving barrier dysfunction in addition to anti-inflammatory activitiesand showed that, by enhancing barrier functions and reducing in- flammation, they had a protective property from colonic diseases[51]. In vitro experiments with normal human colon cells showed that Potentilla extracts, especially at lower concentration, de- creased IL 6 production in myofibroblasts but in epithelial cells the level of the cytokine was stable. IL 10 analysis revealed that a Tormentil extract decreased cytokine level in myofibroblasts, andonly in higher concentration in epithelial cells. The extract signifi- cantly influenced cellular cytoskeleton organization and the lining of the human colon wall by modulating the viability or cytokineproduction of the cells. The authors concluded that the Tormentilextract, with the additional property of a free radical scavenger,could be successfully used in the prevention of inflammatory co-lon disorders [52]. According to a second traditional use for Tormentil prepara- tions, that of curing diarrhea, a randomized, double-blind, con- trolled trial was conducted in 2003 with an oral administration of a Tormentil root extract in children with rotavirus-induced diar-rhea. The extract was prepared at the hospital pharmacy from1 part of dried root with 10 parts 40% ethanol. The concentrationof polyphenols in the extract was approximately between 30 and40% as determined by HPLC. As a placebo, an alcoholic extract ofIndian teas was prepared, which was identical in appearance andtaste to Tormentil root extract. Forty children aged 3 mo to 7 y were divided into 2 groups: a treatment group of 20 children treated with Tormentil root extract and a control group of 20 chil-dren who received a placebo. All patients received 3 drops per y ofage of either the Tormentil extract (approx. 1 -1.5 mg tannins/kg BW/day) or the placebo extract, 3 times daily until the end of diar-rhea but for a maximum of 5 days. The measurement of stool andvomit output was used to evaluate diarrhea, and physical exami-nation was used to assess degree of dehydration in children. The duration of diarrhea in the Tormentil treatment group was 3 days, compared with 5 days in the control group. In the treatmentgroup, 40% of the children were diarrhea-free 48 h after admis-sion to the hospital, compared with 5% in the placebo group. Pa-tients in the treatment group received smaller volumes of paren-terally administered fluids compared to patients in the placebogroup. The authors concluded that the treatment with Tormentilextract appears to be an effective therapy [53]. Unfortunately, apart from a few review articles referring to this particular clinical trial, no other studies have been published. In some Europeancountries, the tincture of Tormentil is traditionally used to treatdiarrhea, as indicated in the HMPC monograph [30]. A review ar-ticle on herbal medicinal products for gastrointestinal disorders inchildren evaluated the use of herbal preparations of P. erecta as asafe adjunct remedy for diarrhea [2]. Only 1 study described thatthe local application of codfish oil and gargling with a tincture from P. erecta in patients with the erosive ulcerative form of lichen planus of the buccal mucosa is beneficial to a quicker control ofthe process. The authors examined 53 patients but focused on atherapy using of codfish oil enriched with polyunsaturated fattyacids [54]. Although the use of the tincture of P. erecta was rather adjuvant in this case, it supports the HMPC indication as describedabove. Tormentil root has traditionally been used to treat inflamma- tory diseases of the skin and mucous membranes. Thieme. All rights reserved.Reviews This document was downloaded for personal use only.

In a combi-nation of experimental in vitro and in vivo pharmacology, the anti- inflammatory effect of agrimoniin-enriched fractions of a P. erecta extract was investigated in both human skin cell models and intest persons. In this study, an extract from the rhizome of P. erecta was used, which was prepared with 40% ethanol and then frac- tionated on a Sephadex LH20 column. Fractions with an increased agrimoniin content were examined on HaCaT keratinocytes. Theexpression of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX 2) induced by ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation and the PGE 2concentration in the cell culture supernatant were analyzed. The extracts inhibited the UVB-in-duced COX 2 expression in HaCaT cells and reduced dose depen- dently the PGE study, it was dem- onstrated, agrimoniin in increased concentrations could dose dependently inhibit UVB-induced inflammation in vivo in a dose- dependent manner. Similarly, increased concentrations of agri-moniin significantly reduced UVB-induced PGE 2production in flu- ids gained with the suction blister technique in vivo . The authors concluded that fractions of P. erecta with a high agrimoniin con- tent display anti-inflammatory effects in in vitro and in vivo in models of UVB-induced inflammation in connection with skin damage [55]. With a similar experimental set-up, the anti-inflam- matory and vasoconstrictive properties of a P. erecta extract were investigated. In irradiated or TNF stimulated HaCaT cells, the herbal extract strongly reduced the formation of IL 6a n dP G E 2or the activation of NF B. Furthermore, the extract showed a blanching effect in human skin comparable to hydrocortisone.However, in contrast to glucocorticoids, the extract did not causenuclear translocation of the glucocorticoid receptor in HaCaT cells. The blanching effect was at least partially attributable to a scavenger effect of nitric oxide (NO) and the inhibition of endo-thelial NO synthase. The authors concluded that the investigatedextract showed anti-inflammatory and vasoconstrictive effects,supporting the traditional use of topical treatment of inflamma-tory skin disorders [56]. Taken together, the human studies sup-port preparations of P. erecta for the traditional use of this tan- nin-rich herbal drug and its broad therapeutic spectrum to treat diseases and damages related to the mucosa or the skin. Further- more, antineoplastic, antiviral, antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory,spasmolytic, and hepatoprotective activities of extracts of P. erec- tahave been reported. However, most of the results shown origi- nate from in vitro experiments [8]. The presumed antineoplastic activity tested in cell models corresponds to cytotoxic effectsrather than a true antitumor activity. Already more than 40 y ago, moderate antiviral effects against Herpesviridae have been demonstrated for extracts of P. erecta rhi- zomes and of hydrolyzable and condensed tannins isolated fromthem. In particular, the antiviral activity against Herpes virus types I and II was reported, as well as the cytotoxic activity against Influ- enza virus type A2 and Cowpox [57]. An animal test system with mice supported the demonstrated antiviral effects of a P. erecta rhizome extract against the Vaccine v i r u st o g e t h e rw i t ha ni n d u c - tion of interferon synthesis [25].Toxicology Due to the limited nature of studies in humans, animal models areused as alternatives to evaluate the safety of herbs. Acute toxicityof an aqueous extract of Tormentil rhizomes was assessed in ratsand mice using a single dose of 2.5 and 6.8 g/kg BW administeredwith a gavage probe. No apparent toxic effect was observed 2 weeks after administration. The authors concluded that extracts should be considered safe for acute toxicity when applied to hu-mans [58]. Conclusion Despite interesting individual results, comprehensive investiga-tions are missing. The nonspecific interaction of different poly- phenols with proteins leads to inhibition of more or less all biolog- ical activities in pharmacological model systems. The main prob-lem seems to be the differentiation between unspecific and spe-cific pharmacological effects of the drug preparation. This factmight be 1 explanation for the rather small importance of P. erecta and its preparations in current phytotherapy, which is based onthe principles of evidence-based medicine. The situation couldchange with the recent findings on the interaction between mi- crobiome and ellagitannins, which are associated with specific anti-inflammatory effects induced by defined metabolites of thetannins.
