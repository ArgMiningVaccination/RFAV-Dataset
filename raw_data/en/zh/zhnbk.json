Tips on How to Clean Your Stomach & Intestines Naturally Keeping your large intestine, or colon, clean might help with some digestive issues like constipation and irregular bowel movements. But it might not do much to eliminate parasites and toxins. Still, a clean stomach and intestines can prevent medical issues. Plus, it'll keep you feeling afloat! Some ways you can do this are: 1. Hydrate Yourself Sipping on at least 8 glasses of water throughout the day is essential for your overall health. Lukewarm water is especially beneficial for you, and it improves digestion as well. Besides water, you can also opt for additional ways to stay hydrated. In addition, some fruits and vegetables also have high water content, like lettuce, celery, watermelons, etc. 2. Saltwater Flush Saltwater flush is commonly used as a colon cleansing method and has a laxative effect. It is effective for short-term colon cleansing.
