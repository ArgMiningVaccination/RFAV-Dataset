Each layer must include at least the following information: 19(1)The name of the pipeline gathering system and other separately named portions thereof; (2)The type of (5)Approximate in-service date. b.The blanket bond covering more than one underground gathering pipeline system is limited to no more than six of the following instances of noncompliance in aggregate: (1)Any portion of an underground gathering pipeline system that has been removed from service for more than one year and is not properly abandoned pursuant to section 43-02-03-29.1; and (2)An underground gathering pipeline right-of-way, including associated above ground equipment, which has not been properly reclaimed pursuant to section 43-02-03-29.1. If this aggregate of underground gathering pipeline systems is reached, the commission may refuse to accept additional pipeline systems on the bond until the aggregate is brought back into compliance. The commission, after notice and hearing, may require higher bond amounts than those referred to in this section. Such additional amounts for bonds must be related to the economic value of the underground gathering pipeline system and the expected cost of pipeline abandonment and right-of-way reclamation, as determined by the commission. The commission may refuse to accept a bond or to add underground gathering pipeline systems to a blanket bond if the owner or surety company has failed in the past to comply with statutes, rules, or orders relating to the operation of underground gathering pipelines; if a civil or administrative action brought by the commission is pending against the owner or surety company; if an underground gathering pipeline system has exhibited multiple failures; or for other good cause. c.The underground gathering pipeline bond is to remain in force until the pipeline has been abandoned, as provided in section 43 -02-03-29.1, and the right-of-way, including all associated above ground equipment, has been reclaimed as provided in section 43-02-03-29.1, or liability of the bond is transferred to another bond that provides the same degree of security. If the principal does not satisfy the bond's conditions, the surety shall satisfy the conditions or forfeit to the commission the face value of the bond. d.Transfer of underground gathering pipelines under bond. Transfer of property does not release the bond. In case of transfer of property or other interest in the underground gathering pipeline and the principal desires to be released from the bond covering the underground gathering pipeline, the principal must proceed as follows: (1)The principal shall notify the director, in writing, of all proposed transfers of underground gathering pipelines at least thirty days before the closing date of the transfer. The director, for good cause, may waive this requirement. Notice of underground gathering pipeline transfer. The principal shall submit, as provided by the director, a geographical information system layer utilizing North American datum 83 geographic coordinate system and in an environmental systems research institute shape file format showing the location of all associated above ground equipment and the pipeline centerline from the point of origin to the termination point of all underground gathering pipelines to be transferred to a certain 20transferee, naming such transferee, for the purpose of ownership or operation. The date of assignment or transfer must be stated and the form 15pl signed by a party duly authorized to sign on behalf of the principal. The notice of underground gathering pipeline transfer must recite the following: \"The transferee has read the foregoing statement and does accept such transfer and does accept the responsibility of such underground gathering pipelines under the transferee's pipeline bond or, as the case may be, does accept the responsibility of such underground gathering pipelines under the transferee's pipeline systems blanket bond, said bond being tendered to or on file with the commission.\" Such acceptance must likewise be signed by a party authorized to sign on behalf of the transferee and the transferee's surety. (2)When the commission has passed upon the transfer and acceptance and accepted it under the transferee's bond, the transferor must be released from the responsibility of abandoning the underground gathering pipelines and right-of-way reclamation. If such underground gathering pipelines include all underground gathering pipeline systems within the responsibility of the transferor's bond, such bond will be released by the commission upon written request. Such request must be signed by an officer of the transferor or a person authorized to sign for the transferor. The director may refuse to transfer any underground gathering pipeline from a bond if the underground gathering pipeline is in violation of a statute, rule, or order. (3)The transferee (new owner) of any underground gathering pipeline is responsible for the abandonment and right-of-way reclamation of any such underground gathering pipeline. For that purpose the transferee shall submit a new bond or, in the case of a surety bond, produce the written consent of the surety of the original or prior bond that the latter's responsibility shall continue and attach to such underground gathering pipeline. The original or prior bond may not be released as to the abandonment and right-of-way reclamation responsibility of any such transferor until the transferee submits to the commission an acceptable bond to cover such underground gathering pipeline. All liability on bonds continues until the abandonment and right-of-way reclamation of such underground gathering pipeline is completed and approved by the director. 9.Bond termination. The commission shall, in writing, advise the principal and any sureties on any bond as to whether the plugging and reclamation is approved. If approved, liability under such bond may be formally terminated upon receipt of a written request by the principal. The request must be signed by an officer of the principal or a person authorized to sign for the principal. 10.Director's authority. The director is vested with the power to act for the commission as to all matters within this section, except requests for alternative forms of security, which may only be approved by the commission.

Application for permit to drill and recomplete. Before any person shall begin any well -site preparation for the drilling of any well other than surveying and staking, such person shall file anobtain approval from the director. An application for 21permit to drill (form 1 or form provided by the commission ) must be filed with the director, together with a permit fee of one hundred dollars. Verbal approval may be given for site preparation by the director in extenuating circumstances. No drilling activity shall Site construction, or appurtenance or road access thereto, may not commence until such application is approved and a permit to drill is issued by the director. The application must be accompanied by the bond pursuant to section 43 -02-03-15 or the applicant must have previously filed such bond with the commission, otherwise the application is incomplete. An incomplete application received by the commission has no standing and will not be deemed filed until it is completed. The application for permit to drill shall be accompanied by an accurate plat certified by a registered surveyor showing the location of the proposed well with reference to true north and the nearest lines of a governmental section, the latitude and longitude of the proposed well location to the nearest tenth of a second, the ground elevation, and the proposed road access to the nearest existing public road. Information to be included in such application shall be the proposed depth to which the well will be drilled, estimated depth to the top of important markers, estimated depth to the top of objective horizons, the proposed mud program, the proposed casing program, including size and weight thereof, the depth at which each casing string is to be set, the proposed pad layout, including cut and fill diagrams, and the proposed amount of cement to be used, including the estimated top of cement. For wells permitted on new pads built after July 31, 2013, permit conditions imposed by the commission may include, upon request of the owner of a permanently occupied dwelling within one thousand feet of the proposed well, requiring the location of all flares, tanks, and treaters utilized in connection with the permitted well be located at a greater distance from the occupied dwelling than the well head, if the location can be reasonably accommodated within the proposed pad location. If the facilities are proposed to be located farther from the dwelling than the well bore, the director can issue the permit without comment from the dwelling owner. The applicant shall give any such owners written notice of the proposed facilities personally or by certified mail, return receipt requested, and addressed to their last-known address listed with the county property tax department. The commission must receive written comments from such owner within five business days of the owner receiving said notice. An application for permit must include an affidavit from the applicant identifying each owner's name and address, and the date written notice was given to each owner. The owner's notice must include: 1.A copy of North Dakota Century Code section 38 -08-05. 2.The name, telephone number, and if available the electronic mail address of the applicant's local representative. 3.A sketch of the area indicating the location of the owner's dwelling, the proposed well, and location of the proposed flare, tanks, and treaters. 4.A statement indicating that any such owner objecting to the location of the flare, tanks, or treaters, must notify the commission within five business days of receiving the notice. Prior to the commencement of recompletion operations or drilling horizontally in the existing pool, an application for permit shallmust be filed withapproved by the director. Included in such application shall be the notice of intention (form 4) to reenter a well by drilling horizontally, deepening, or plugging back to any source of supply other than the producing horizon in an existing well. Such notice shall include the name and file number and exact location of the well, the approximate date operations will begin, the proposed procedure, the estimated completed total depth, the anticipated hydrogen sulfide content in produced gas from the proposed source of supply, the weight and grade of all casing currently installed in the well unless waived by the director, the casing program to be followed, and the original total depth with a permit fee of fifty dollars. The director may deny any application if it is determined, in accordance with the latest version of ANSI/NACE MR0175/ISO 15156, that the casing currently installed in the well would be subject to sulfide stress cracking. 22The applicant shall provide all information, in addition to that specifically required by this section, if requested by the director. The director may impose such terms and conditions on the permits issued under this section as the director deems necessary. The director shall deny an application for a permit under this section if the proposal would cause, or tend to cause, waste or violate correlative rights. The director of oil and gas shall state in writing to the applicant the reason for the denial of the permit. The applicant may appeal the decision of the director to the commission. A permit to drill automatically expires one year after the date it was issued, unless the well is drilling or has been drilled below surface casing. A permit to recomplete or to drill horizontally automatically expires one year after the date it was issued, unless such project has commenced.

Revocation and limitation of drilling permits. 1.After notice and hearing, the commission may revoke a drilling, recompletion, or reentry permit or limit its duration. The commission may act upon its own motion or upon the application of an owner in the spacing or drilling unit. In deciding whether to revoke or limit a permit, the factors that the commission may consider include: a.The technical ability of the permitholder and other owners to drill and complete the well. b.The experience of the permitholder and other owners in drilling and completing similar wells. c.The number of wells in the area operated by the permitholder and other owners. d.Whether drainage of the spacing or drilling unit has occurred or is likely to occur in the immediate future and whether the permitholder has committed to drill a well in a timely fashion. e.Contractual obligations such as an expiring lease. f.The amount of ownership the permitholder and other owners hold in the spacing or drilling unit. If the permitholder is the majority owner in the unit or if its interest when combined with that of its supporters is a majority of the ownership, it is presumed that the permitholder should retain the permit. This presumption, even if not rebutted, does not prohibit the commission from limiting the duration of the permit. However, if the amount of the interest owned by the owner seeking revocation or limitation and its supporters are a majority of the ownership, the commission will presume that the permit should be revoked. 2.The commission may suspend a permit that is the subject of a revocation or limitation proceeding. A, although a permit will not be suspended or revoked after operations have commenced. 3.If the commission revokes a permit upon the application of an owner and issues a permit to that owner or to another owner who supported revocation, the commission may limit the duration of such permit. The commission may also, if the parties fail to agree, order the owner acquiring the permit to pay reasonable costs incurred by the former permitholder and the conditions under which payment is to be made. The costs for which reimbursement may be 23ordered may include those involving survey of the well site, title search of surface and mineral title, and preparation of an opinion of mineral ownership. 4.If the commission declines to revoke a permit or limit the time within which it must be exercised, it may include a term in its order restricting the ability of the permitholder to renew the permit or to acquire another permit within the same spacing or drilling unit.

If an election to participate lapses, a risk penalty can only be collected if the owner seeking it again complies with the provisions of this section. e.An invitation to participate in a unit expense covering monthly operating expenses shall be effective for all such monthly operating expenses for a period of five years if the unit expense identified in the invitation to participate is first commenced within ninety days after the date set in the invitation to participate as the date upon which a response to the invitation to participate must be received. An election to participate in a unit expense covering monthly operating expenses is effective for five years after operations are first commenced. If an election to participate in a unit expense comprised of monthly operating expenses expires or lapses after five years, a risk penalty may only be assessed and collected if the owner seeking the penalty once again complies with this section. 3.Upon its own motion or the request of a party, the commission may include in a pooling order requirements relating to the invitation and election to participate, in which case the pooling order will control to the extent it is inconsistent with this section. 25History: Effective December 1, 1996; amended effective May 1, 2004; January 1, 2006; January 1, 2008; April 1, 2010; April 1, 2012; April 1, 2014 ; April 1, 38-08-04 provided in section 43-02-03-19sections 43-02-03-19.4, 43-02-03-19.5, and 43-02-03-51.3, no saltwater, drilling mud, crude oil, waste oil, or other waste shall be stored in earthen pits or open receptacles except in an emergency and upon approval by the director. A lined earthen pit or open receptacle may be temporarily used to retain oil, water, cement, solids, or fluids generated in well plugging operations. A pit or receptacle used for this purpose must be sufficiently impermeable to provide adequate temporary containment of the oil, water, or fluids. The contents of the pit or receptacle must be removed within seventy -two hours after operations have ceased and must be disposed of at an authorized facility in accordance with section 43 -02-03-19.2. Within thirty days after operations have ceased, the earthen pit shall be reclaimed and the open receptacle shall be removed. The director may grant an extension of the thirty -day time period to no more than one year for good reason. The director may permit pits or receptacles used solely for the purpose of flaring casinghead gas. A pit or receptacle used for this purpose must be sufficiently impermeable to provide adequate temporary containment of fluids. Permission for such pit or receptacle shall be conditioned on locating the pit not less than one hundred fifty feet [45.72 meters] from the vicinity of wells and tanks and keeping it free of any saltwater, crude oil, waste oil, or other waste. Saltwater, drilling mud, crude oil, waste oil, or other waste shall be removed from the pit or receptacle within twenty -four hours after being discovered and must be disposed of at an authorized facility in accordance with section 43 -02-03-19.2. The director may permit pits used solely for storage of freshwater used in completion and well servicing operations. Permits for freshwater pits shall be valid for a period of one year but may be reauthorized upon application.

Casing, tubing, and cementing requirements. All wells drilled for oil, natural gas, or injection shall be completed with strings of casing which shall be properly cemented at sufficient depths to adequately protect and isolate all formations containing water, oil, or gas or any combination of these; protect the pipe through salt sections encountered; and isolate the uppermost sand of the Dakota group. 26Drilling of the surface hole shall be with freshwater -based drilling mud or other method approved by the director which will protect all freshwater -bearing strata. The surface casing shall consist of new or reconditioned pipe that has been previously tested to one thousand pounds per square inch [6900 kilopascals]. The surface casing shall be set and cemented at a point not less than fifty feet [15.24 meters] below the base of the Fox Hills formation. Sufficient cement shall be used on surface casing to fill the annular space behind the casing to the bottom of the cellar, if any, or to the surface of the ground. If the annulus space is not adequately filled with cement, the director shall be notified immediately. The operator shall diligently perform remedial work after obtaining approval from the director. All strings of surface casing shall stand cemented under pressure for at least twelve hours before drilling the plug or initiating tests. The term \"under pressure\" as used herein shall be complied with if one float valve is used or if pressure is otherwise held. Cementing shall be by the pump and plug method or other methods approved by the director. The director is authorized to require an accurate gauge be maintained on the surface casing of any well, not properly plugged and abandoned, to detect any buildup of pressure caused by the migration of fluids. Surface casing strings must be allowed to stand under pressure until the tail cement has reached a compressive strength of at least five hundred pounds per square inch [3450 kilopascals]. All filler cements utilized must reach a compressive strength of at least two hundred fifty pounds per square inch [1725 kilopascals] within twenty -four hours and at least three hundred fifty pounds per square inch [2415 kilopascals] within seventy -two hours. All compressive strengths on surface casing cement shall be calculated at a temperature of eighty degrees Fahrenheit [26.67 degrees Celsius]. Production or intermediate casing strings shall consist of new or reconditioned pipe that has been previously tested to two thousand pounds per square inch [13800 kilopascals]. Such strings must be allowed to stand under pressure until the tail cement has reached a compressive strength of at least five hundred pounds per square inch [3450 kilopascals]. All filler cements utilized must reach a compressive strength of at least two hundred fifty pounds per square inch [1725 kilopascals] within twenty-four hours and at least five hundred pounds per square inch [3450 kilopascals] within seventy-two hours, although in any horizontal well performing a single stage cement job from a measured depth of greater than thirteen thousand feet [3962.4 meters], the filler cement utilized must reach a compressive strength of at least two hundred fifty pounds per square inch [1725 kilopascals] within forty-eight hours and at least five hundred pounds per square inch [3450 kilopascals] within ninety-six hours. All compressive strengths on production or intermediate casing cement shall be calculated at a temperature found in the Mowry formation using a gradient of 1.2 degrees Fahrenheit per one hundred feet [30.48 meters] of depth plus eighty degrees Fahrenheit [26.67 degrees Celsius]. At a formation temperature at or in excess of two hundred thirty degrees Fahrenheit [110 degrees Celsius], cement blends must include additives to address compressive strength regression. After cementing, the Each casing string shall be tested by application of pump pressure of at least one thousand five hundred pounds per square inch [10350 kilopascals] immediately after cementing, while the cement is in a liquid state, or the casing string must be pressure tested after all cement has reached five hundred pounds per square inch [3450 kilopascals] compressive strength . If, at the end of thirty minutes, this pressure has dropped one hundred fifty pounds per square inch [1035 kilopascals] or more than ten percent , the casing shall be repaired after receiving approval from the director. Thereafter, the casing shall again be tested in the same manner. Further work shall not proceed until a satisfactory test has been obtained. The casing in a horizontal well may be tested by use of a mechanical tool set near the casing shoe after the horizontal section has been drilled. All flowing wells must be equipped with tubing. A tubing packer must also be utilized unless a waiver is obtained after demonstrating the casing will not be subjected to excessive pressure or corrosion. The packer must be set as near the producing interval as practicable, but in all cases must be above the perforations. 27History: Amended effective April 30, 1981; January 1, 1983; May 1, 1992; July 1, 1996; January 1, 1997; September 1, 2000; July 1, 2002; May 1, 2004; January 1, 2006; April 1, 2010; April 1, 2012 ; April 1, 38-08-04 Law Implemented: NDCC 38-08-04 43-02-03-23. Blowout prevention. In all drilling operations, proper and necessary precautions shall be taken for keeping the well under control, including the use of a blowout preventer and high pressure fittings attached to properly cemented casing strings adequate to withstand anticipated pressures. During the course of drilling, the pipe rams shall be functionally operated at least once every twenty -four-hour period. The blind rams shall be functionally operated each trip out of the well bore. The blowout preventer shall be pressure tested at installation on the wellhead, after modification of any equipment, and every thirty days thereafter. For pad drilling operations, moving from one wellhead to another within the thirty days, pressure testing is required on connections when the integrity of a pressure seal is broken or a component appears to be damaged or compromised. The director may postpone such pressure test if the necessity therefor can be demonstrated to the director's satisfaction. All tests shall be noted in the driller's record. In all workover operations, proper and necessary precautions must be taken for keeping the well under control, including the use of a blowout preventer and high pressure fittings attached to properly cemented casing strings adequate to withstand anticipated pressures.

Prior to performing any workover project on an existing well, during which the packer or other means of annular isolation could be affected, the operator shall obtain approval from the director. All existing injection wells must demonstrate continual mechanical integrity and be tested at least once every five years. Following the completion of any remedial work, the operator shall demonstrate the mechanical integrity of the well. The director may require further mechanical integrity tests or other remedial work to ensure the mechanical integrity of the well to prevent the movement of fluid into an underground source of drinking water or an unauthorized zone. Mechanical integrity pressure tests must be performed at one thousand pounds per square inch [6900 kilopascals] for a minimum of fifteen minutes. A mechanical integrity test pressure of less than one thousand pounds per square inch [6900 kilopascals] may be approved by the director. Once an injection well is determined to lack mechanical integrity, within ninety days of the determination, it must be repaired and retested or plugged and abandoned. An injection well has mechanical integrity if: a.There is no significant leak in the casing, tubing, or packer; and b.There is no significant fluid movement into an underground source of drinking water or an unauthorized zone through vertical channels adjacent to the injection bore. 2.One of the following methods must be used to evaluate the absence of significant leaks: a.Pressure test with liquid or gas. b.Monitoring of positive annulus pressure following a valid pressure test. c.Radioactive tracer survey. 3.One of the following methods must be used to establish the absence of significant fluid movement: a.A log from which cement can be determined or well records demonstrating the presence of adequate cement to prevent such migration. b.Radioactive tracer survey, temperature log, or noise log. 4. The operator of an injection well immediately shall shut-in the well if mechanical failure indicates fluids are, or may be, migrating into an underground source of drinking water or an unauthorized zone, or if so directed by the director.

Providers who are certified for participation in Medicare are eligible for participation, providing no sanction has been imposed as provided for in section 75-02-05-0875-02-05-07. Comparable standards for providers who do not participate in Medicare are established by state law and appropriate licensing and standard -setting authorities in the health and mental health fields. 1.Payment for covered services under Medicaid and children's health insurance program is limited to those covered services that are medically necessary for the proper management, control, or treatment of an individual's medical problem and provided under the physician's or licensed practitioner's direction and supervision. 2.Each provider agrees to retain documentation to support medical services rendered for a minimum of seven years and, upon request, to make the documentation available to persons acting on behalf of the department and the United States department of health and human services. A provider shall provide the records at no charge. 3.A provider must accept, as payment in full, the amounts paid in accordance with the payment structure established by the department. A provider performing a procedure or service may not request or receive any payment, in addition to the amounts established by the department, from the recipient, or anyone acting on the recipient's behalf, for the same procedure or service. In cases where a client share has been properly determined by a county social service boardhuman service zone , the provider may hold the recipient responsible for the client share. 1864.A provider may not bill a recipient for services that are allowable under Medicaid or children's health insurance program, but not paid due to the provider's lack of adherence to Medicaid or children's health insurance program requirements. 5.If an enrolled Medicaid or children's health insurance program provider does not bill Medicaid for certain services, the enrolled Medicaid or children's health insurance program provider must notify all recipients of any limitation and secure acknowledgment, in writing. If the provider expressly informs the recipient, or in the case of a child, the recipient's parent or guardian, that provider would not accept Medicaid or children's health insurance program payment for certain services, the provider may bill the recipient as a private-pay client for the services. 6.No Medicaid or children's health insurance program payment will be made for claims received by the department later than twelve months following the date the service was provided. Claim adjustments submitted within twelve months of the most recent processed claim shall be considered timely. 7.The department will process claims six months past the Medicare explanation of benefits date if the provider followed Medicare's timely filing policy. 8.In all joint Medicare/Medicaid cases, a provider must accept assignment of Medicare payment to receive payment from Medicaid for amounts not covered by Medicaid and children's health insurance program. 9.When the recipient has other medical insurance, all benefits available due from that other insurance must be applied prior to the provider accepting payment by Medicaid. 10.A provider may not offer or accept a fee, portion of a fee, charge, rebate, or kickback for a Medicaid or children's health insurance program patient referral. 11.Claims for payment and documentation must be submitted as required by the department or its designee. 12.A provider shall comply with all accepted standards of professional conduct and practice in dealing with recipients and the department. 13.Each provider shall comply with all applicable centers for Medicare and Medicaid services regulations. 14.Each provider shall comply with requests for documentation from the provider's practice, that may include patient information for non-Medicaid or non-children's health insurance program recipients, which allows department staff or its authorized agent to evaluate overall scheduling, patient-to-provider ratios, billing practices, or evaluating the feasibility of services provided per day.

The term \"covered employment\" does not include employment in which the employer is required by the laws of that other state to purchase workers' compensation coverage in that other state. b.\"Employee\" means any North Dakota employee as that term is defined in North Dakota Century Code section 65 -01-02 who engages in covered employment and who is eligible to file for workers' compensation benefits in another state if the employee suffers a work-related illness or injury or dies as a result of work activities in that state. The term \"employee\" also includes a person with optional workers' compensation coverage in this state under North Dakota Century Code section 65 -04-29 or 65-07-01 who engages in covered employment and is eligible to file for workers' compensation benefits in another state if that person suffers a work -related illness or injury or dies as a result of work activities in that state. c.\"Employer\" means an employer as defined in North Dakota Century Code section 65-01-02, who is not materially delinquent in payment of premium, and who has employees engaged in covered employment.

The term \"dependents\" includes an employee's spouse. The organization may pay benefits on behalf of an employer but may not act nor be deemed as an insurer, nor may the organization indemnify an employer for any liabilities, except as specifically provided in this section.

Medical benefits provided pursuant to this section are subject to any fee schedule and other limitations imposed by the workers' compensation law of the elected state. The North Dakota fee schedule does not apply to this section. The organization may reimburse an employer covered by this section for legal costs and for reasonable attorney's fees incurred.
