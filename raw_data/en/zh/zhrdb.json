Dolk MSc, PhD, Maarten J. Postma, PhD ABSTRACT Objective: This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of extending the Dutch in fluenza vaccination program for elderly and medical high-risk groups to include pediatric in fluenza vaccination, taking indirect protection into account. Methods: An age-structured dynamic transmission model was used that was calibrated to in fluenza-associated GP visits over 4 seasons (2010-2011 to 2013-2014). The clinical and economic impact of different pediatric vaccination strategies werecompared over 20 years, varying the targeted age range, the vaccine type for children or elderly and high-risk groups.Outcome measures include averted symptomatic infections and deaths, societal costs and quality-adjusted life-years(QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Costs and QALYs were discounted at 4% and 1.5% annually. Results: At an assumed coverage of 50%, adding pediatric vaccination for 2- to 17-year-olds with quadrivalent live-attenuated vaccine to the current vaccination program for elderly and medical high-groups with quadrivalent inactivated vaccine wasestimated to avert, on average, 401 820 symptomatic cases and 72 deaths per year. Approximately half of avertedsymptomatic cases and 99% of averted deaths were prevented in other age groups than 2- to 17-year-olds due to herdimmunity. The cumulative discounted 20-year economic impact was 35 068 QALYs gained and V1687 million saved, that is, the intervention was cost-saving. This vaccination strategy had the highest probability of being the most cost-effectivestrategy considered, dominating pediatric strategies targeting 2- to 6-year-olds or 2- to 12-year-olds or strategies withtrivalent inactivated vaccine. Conclusion: Modeling indicates that introducing pediatric in fluenza vaccination in The Netherlands is cost-saving, reducing the in fluenza-related disease burden substantially.

VALUE HEALTH. 2021; 24(1):19 -31 Introduction Seasonal in fluenza epidemics are responsible for a consider- able clinical and economic burden.1,2Although most severe out- comes occur among the elderly and chronically ill, increasing evidence shows that the in fluenza-related burden among children is also relevant.3Young children are frequently hospitalized, require an outpatient visit, or stay at home from school, causing work loss among caregivers.4,5Furthermore, children are thought to play a key role in the transmission of in fluenza because they have more close contacts than adults and limited preexisting immunity.6Ecological studies as well as mathematical modeling studies suggest that pediatric in fluenza vaccination would provide not only direct protection but also indirect protection to suscep- tible contacts due to herd immunity.7-12 Anticipating these direct and indirect bene ts, several coun- tries have issued positive recommendations for pediatric in fluenzavaccination.13For instance, the United Kingdom is rolling out a publicly funded vaccination program for 2- to 16-year-olds.14In The Netherlands, in fluenza vaccination is offered free of charge to individuals aged $60 years and those in high-risk groups due to chronic illnesses.15In 2007, pediatric in fluenza vaccination was not recommended by the Health Council of The Netherlands because the risk of severe complications and mortality was not considered high enough.16However, the discussion is ongoing, and the decision on pediatric in fluenza vaccination will be reas- sessed in 2020.17 Cost-effectiveness is a relevant aspect in the decision whether to implement vaccination programs in most countries, including The Netherlands.18Against this perspective, we conducted a cost- effectiveness analysis of inclusion of pediatric in fluenza vaccina- tion in the current vaccination program for elderly and high-risk groups in The Netherlands. As pediatric in fluenza vaccination is expected to confer indirect effects on the wider community, a *Pieter T. de Boer and Lisa Nagy have contributed equally to this article. 1098-3015 - see front matter Copyright \u00aa2020, ISPOR -The Professional Society for Health Economics and Outcomes Research.

Methods Overview The analysis uses a probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) approach, taking into account uncertainty in the transmission, clinical, and economic parameters. A deterministic transmission model was used to simulate the population-level dynamics of influenza infection (see Transmission Model section below). To incorporate uncertainty in the transmission parameters, a set of key transmission parameters was repeatedly sampled from input distributions. Those sets that tted the observed information from The Netherlands were retained and are collectively referred to as the calibrated model (see Calibration section below). The updated sets of parameter distributions were then integrated with the transmission model to produce a PSA of the transmission parameter inputs. Results of the transmission model served as an input for the economic PSA in which clinical and economic pa- rameters were sampled and outcomes were compared for a range of vaccination policies (see Expected Net Bene t Analysis section below). Transmission Model The dynamic transmission model is a compartmental model, strati ed by age in months. The model uses a SEIR FRLS(V) struc- ture (susceptible, exposed, infectious, recovered with short-term immunity, recovered with long-term immunity, vaccinated). The short-term and long-term immunity states should be viewed as a single immunity state, but chaining such 2 states together allows for greater flexibility in the distribution of time individuals stay in the immunity state. Aging was simulated on a monthly basis, informed by Dutch population data.19-21The Netherlands-speci c contact rates22informed an age-strati ed matrix of transmission coefcients, which were assumed to vary sinusoidally over time. Influenza A and in fluenza B were simulated independently with strains from H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes for in fluenza A, and from Victoria and Yamagata lineages for in fluenza B. Both strains were modeled simultaneously with the flows of individuals be- tween compartments described by a set of linked differential equations (see Appendix 1, Figure 1.3 and Equation 1 ). Patients could not be infected with 2 strains at once. Further details are provided in Appendix 1 in Supplemental Materials found at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2020.10.011 . Calibration The transmission model was run for the 2010-2011 through 2013-2014 seasons for sets of input parameter samples. The main source for the model calibration was a set of The Netherlands - speci c general practitioner (GP) consultation rates obtained from a regression of in fluenza-like-illness (consultation data against laboratory-con rmed in fluenza reports).23Influenza- associated GP consultation rates were strati ed by in fluenza strain, age group (0-4, 5-19, 20-59, and $60 years), and season (2010-2011, 2013-2014). Whether a set of parameter samples provided a good t is decided by comparing the Poisson deviance between the model results and the observed in fluenza-associated GP visits, together with a set of heuristic criteria (see Appendix 1 in Supplemental Materials found at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2 020.10.011 ), retaining the best- tting runs. Key inputs of transmission parameters were drawn from assigned input distributions ( Table 1 ). The model simulatedvaccination with trivalent inactivated (TIV), A subtypes (H1N1 and H3N2) and 1 in fluenza B lineage (either Victoria or Yamagata). Vaccine composition was obtained from WHO recommenda- tions.24Efcacy of TIV by age was obtained from the literature.25,26 Age-speci c vaccine uptake rates from the seasons 2010-2011 to 2013-2014 were used (see Appendix 1: Table 1.6 in Supplemental Materials found at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2020.10.011 ).27 The duration of vaccine-induced protection was much shorter than that of naturally acquired immunity. No cross-immunity from infections or vaccines were assumed. Further details are provided in Appendix 1 in Supplemental Materials found at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2020.10.011 . Expected Net Bene t Analysis The calibrated model was used to compare the clinical and economic impact of a range of vaccination strategies. For each set of parameter samples of the calibration, the model was run for-ward from 2010-2011 to 2034-2035. Explored vaccination strate- gies diverged from the 2015-2016 season, and results from the period 2015-2016 to 2034-2035 were used (20-year time horizon). The initial output of the model integration concerned incidence of infection. Risk functions of clinical outcomes were applied to the incidence of infection in order to estimate the number of symp- tomatic cases, GP visits, hospitalizations, and deaths. Estimates of costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) lost were then applied to the clinical outcomes. Costs were discounted at 4% per year and QALYs at 1.5% per year from the start of the 2015-2016 season. 28 Further details are provided in Appendix 1 in Supplemental Materials found at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2020.10.011 . Vaccination strategies Vaccines considered for elderly and high-risk groups were TIV and quadrivalent inactivated vaccine (QIV). QIV includes antigens of both in fluenza B lineages (Victoria and Yamagata) and has been used in the Dutch in fluenza vaccination program since the 2019- 2020 season. Pediatric vaccination strategies were assumed to be imple- mented in addition to the current program for elderly and high-risk groups and considered vaccination with TIV and the intranasally administered quadrivalent live-attenuated in fluenza vaccine (Q-LAIV) for the age groups 2-6 years, 2-12 years, and 2-17 years. Given that postlicensure studies comparing the effective- ness between LAIVs and inactivated vaccines (IVs) show equivocal results,29-31we assumed the ef cacy of LAIV to be equal to IV. Consequently, results of pediatric strategies with Q-LAIV are also representative for pediatric strategies with QIV. The combination of TIV in children and QIV in elderly and high-risk groups was not considered. Finally, a strategy of no in fluenza vaccination at all was added. Annual vaccine uptake in the pediatric vaccination program was assumed at 50%, in accordance with emerging uptake data from the UK 's pediatric in fluenza vaccination program.32The receipt of 1 dose per year was assumed irrespective of whether influenza vaccine had been received before. Vaccine uptake in elderly and high-risk groups was assumed to be unchanged, and the latest data of the 2013-2014 season were carried forward (overall uptake of approximately 3% in 0-17 years, 8% in 18-59 years, and 65% in $60 years). Outcome probabilities Outcome probabilities are shown in Table 1 . The probability of symptoms, given in fluenza infection, was obtained from the20 VALUE IN HEALTH JANUARY 2021Table 1.

Pre- scription of antiviral medication by Dutch GPs is restrained34and therefore not considered in the model. Age-speci c probabilities of hospitalization were based on Dutch estimates of the rela- tionship between respiratory-associated hospitalization and influenza-like -illness incidence at the GP.35Age-speci c proba- bilities of death were based on Dutch incidence rates of respiratory-associated in fluenza death.36 Economic input Economic input is shown in Table 1 .

All costs were converted to 2017 euros using the Dutch consumer price index.37We distinguished healthcare costs (vac- cine, administration, GP visits including prescribed medication and specialist visits, hospitalizations, and indirect healthcare costs in life-years gained), patient costs (over-the-counter medication and travel), and productivity losses (missed work days of cases aged 15-74 years, parents of sick children aged ,15 years, and premature deaths using the friction method). We used the tendered price of TIV from the national vaccina- tion program.38Vaccine prices of QIV and Q-LAIV were assumed to be 50% higher than that of TIV, based on the relative price dif- ference of the list price of QIV and TIV.39Administration costs were based on the tariff that GPs receive for in fluenza vaccinationTable 1.

The annual vaccination campaign was assumed to start in mid-October. Efcacy against laboratory-con rmed in fluenza of the inactivated vaccines by age was obtained from a meta-analyses of clinical trial data. We assumed the ef cacy of inactivated and live-attenuated in fluenza vaccines to be the same. Vaccine ef cacy in those 65 and older was assumed at 50%, based on ef cacy estimates against pneumonia, hospitalizations, and death in care home residents. \u00a7GP costs include also costs of prescribed drugs and specialist visits. kWide distribution around plausible previous values were chosen from the literature and sampled uniformly within this range, to allow the model itsel f to coalesce to a distribution. {Productivity losses were calculated by multiplying the number of work days lost per clinical event (adjusted for labor participation rates) with age -speci c average daily wages. For parental work loss we used labor participation rates and wages of the age group 25-44 years. For deaths, we estimated the productivity loss u sing the friction method, assuming the number of work days lost at 85 days.2822 VALUE IN HEALTH JANUARY 2021in the current program.38Age-speci c costs of in fluenza disease were obtained from published sources or national datasets. Since the update of the Dutch cost-effectiveness guideline in 2016, the inclusion of indirect healthcare costs (ie, healthcare costs unre- lated to in fluenza that occur in gained life-years) is recom- mended.28These costs were estimated using the life expectancy at age of death and annual healthcare costs unrelated to in fluenza or pneumonia from the Practical Application to Include Disease Costs tool.40 QALY losses due to in fluenza illness were based on studies using the validated EuroQol-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) instrument.41 QALYs lost due to premature death were calculated using thelife expectancy at age of death multiplied by age-speci c popu- lation norms of quality of life. 42To account for the increase of life expectancy over time, we used predictions of the year 2024 (halfway through the time horizon).43 Cost-effectiveness The base-case estimate per vaccination scenario was obtained by averaging the clinical and economic results across simulations. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated by dividing the difference in costs by the difference in QALYs. Results are also presented as net health bene ts (NHB), in which mone- tary outcomes are converted into QALYs using a cost-effectiveness threshold ( l). We used a threshold of V20 000 per QALY gained that is often applied for prevention programs in TheNetherlands. 44We also draw cost-effectiveness acceptability curves to present the probability of being cost-effective over arange of cost-effectiveness thresholds. Because for some cost- effectiveness thresholds the policy with the highest probability of being cost-effective might not correspond to the one with the highest NHB,45the probability of the optimal policy (highest NHB) over a range of cost-effectiveness thresholds was shown in a cost- effectiveness acceptability frontier. Univariate sensitivity analysis Univariate sensitivity analyses were performed to test for structural uncertainty, including variation of the pediatric vaccine uptake to 20% and 80%, a higher vaccine ef cacy of LAIV according to clinical trial data,46and the vaccine price. Results Calibration During the calibration stage, 7198 simulations were selected as a close enough t to the Dutch data. The resulting updated dis- tributions are plotted in the in Supplemental Materials ( Appendix 2: Figure 2.1-Figure 2.7 and Table 2.1-Table 2.3 found at https:// doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2020.10.011 ), as are comparisons of the model incidence to the GP regression data ( Appendix 2: Figure 2.8-Figure 2.11 found at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.202 0.10.011 ). Sampling from uniform input distributions and keep- ing the samples that met the calibration criteria produced clearly dened unimodal distributions for the basic reproduction num- ber; these distributions were clearly updated from their initial Table 2.

The estimated basic reproduction numbers are also in line with values for seasonal influenza reported in the literature.47 Clinical Impact Clinical outcomes predicted by the model were averaged across simulations to give the expected average annual clinical burden of in fluenza in The Netherlands over the 20-year time horizon, along with ranges in which 95% of the 7198 simulations fell ( Table 2 ). On average, the historic vaccination program for elderly and high-risk groups with TIV prevented 202 931 (95%range: 69 058-522 523) symptomatic cases and 274 (76-1152) deaths per year compared to no vaccination. Replacing TIV with QIV prevented an additional 56 216 (95% range: 12 612-138 093) symptomatic cases and 61 (19-150) deaths per year. Figure 1 shows 20-year average annual clinical events rates per 100 000 population by age, indicating that the prevented clinical events were mainly in adults. Introducing pediatric vaccination was estimated to prevent a substantial additional number of clinical events, and its impact in- creases by targeting a broader age group or by using Q-LAIV instead of TIV or both. Inclusion of Q-LAIV for 2- to 17-year-olds at 50% coverage in the vaccination program for elderly and high-risk groups with QIV prevented, on average, 136 996 (95% range: 57 788-284 623) symptomatic cases and 20 (2-52) deaths per year, and thisFigure 1. 20-year average clinical outcome rates by age in The Netherlands as estimated by the model. The different panels show outcomes of (A) symptomatic cases, (B) GP visits, (C) hospitalizations, and (D) deaths. Current practice concerns the invitation of all adults aged$60 years and individuals aged ,60 with certain chronic illnesses with overall uptake rates of approximately 3% in ,18 years, 8% in 18-59 years and 65% in .60 years. Pediatric vaccination strategies assume a vaccination uptake of 50% in the indicated age-group. To improve the readability of the gure, we selected pediatric vaccination strategies with Q-LAIV that were added to vaccination of elderly and high-risk groups with QIV. GP indicates general practitioner; JANUARY 2021number increased to 333 109 (179 110-648 441) symptomatic cases and 56 (19-124) deaths per year for targeting 2- to 12-year-olds, and to 401 820 (224 125-760 152) symptomatic cases and 72 (30-155) deaths per year for targeting 2- to 17-year-olds. The pediatric vaccination program offered substantial herd immunity ( Fig. 1 ); approximately half of prevented symptomatic cases and 99% of prevented deaths were in other age groups than 2- to 17-year-olds.Another indirect effect of pediatric vaccination was an age shift of influenza cases to older age-groups. For instance, vaccination for 2- to 6-year-olds increased the number of in fluenza cases among 10- to 17-years-olds compared with no pediatric vaccination ( Fig. 1 ). Cost-Effectiveness The 20-year cumulative discounted total costs and QALY losses, calculated as the average across all simulations run, are summa- rized in Table 3 . From a societal perspective, inclusion of pediatricvaccination into the vaccination program for elderly and high-risk groups was estimated to result in lower costs and fewer QALYs lost\u2014that is, adding pediatric vaccination is dominant \u2014and each extension of the targeted pediatric age group or a switch from TIV to Q-LAIV dominated the preceding scenario. Considering all strategies, vaccination of 2- to 17-year-olds with Q-LAIV and vaccination of elderly and high-risk groups with QIV dominated allother scenarios. The discounted 20-year cumulative savings of this strategy were 35 068 QALYs and V1687 million (NHB: 119 430 QALYs) compared to QIV for elderly and high-risk groups. The majority of the QALYs gained were due to prevention of in fluenza illness rather than prevention of in fluenza deaths ( Figure 2 A), and the majority of costs saved were due to the reduction of produc- tivity losses among in fluenza cases or caregivers of sick children (Figure 2 B). All strategies were expected to be cost-saving compared to no vaccination, with the exception of vaccination program for elderly and high-risk groups with TIV, which is likelyTable 3.

Vaccination strategy (Current/pediatric)Total 22,807 -11.2 Note. Current practice concerns the invitation of all adults aged $60 years and individuals aged ,60 with certain chronic illnesses with overall uptake rates of approximately 3% in ,18 years, 8% in 18-59 years and 65% in .60 years. Pediatric vaccination strategies assume a vaccination uptake of 50% in the indicated age- group. Results include an annual discount rate of 4% for costs and 1.5% for QALYs and can therefore not be averaged across seasons. ICER indicates incremental of age. *Vaccination policies were listed as dominated when there was another policy with a QALY gain against lower costs (strict dominance) or a QALY gain aga inst a lower ICER (extended dominance). Calculated QALYs gained, calculated from Table 3 ). From a payer 's perspective, inclusion of pediatric vaccination into the vaccination for elderly and high-risk groups was expected to result in higher total costs but remained cost-effective to a threshold of V20 000 per QALY. For instance, the inclusion of Q-LAIV for 2- to 17-year-olds with Q-LAIV into the vaccination program for elderly and high-risk groups with QIV resulted in a discounted 20-year cumulative cost of V458 million, and the ICER wasV13 004 per QALY gained (calculated from Table 3 ). Consid- ering all strategies, vaccination of 2- to 17-year-olds with Q-LAIV and elderly and high-risk groups with QIV dominated all other vaccination strategies due to fewer QALY lost and a lower ICER. Compared with no vaccination, the ICER of this strategy was V22 807 per QALY gained. Probabilistic Sensitivity Analysis The multivariate PSA demonstrated that the uncertainty around the economic impact of pediatric vaccination was considerable, but the trend of the average values is clear ( Fig. 3 A). The 95% ranges of adding Q-LAIV for 2- to 17-year-olds to QIV for elderly and high-risk groups were 19 187-69 567 QALYs and V693 million- V3722 million saved, resulting in a range the NHB of 54 723-252 097 QALYs. The cost-effectiveness acceptability curve and the cost-effectiveness acceptability frontier, in which individual simulations are compared, indicate that the strategy of QIV for elderly and high-risk groups and Q-LAIV for 2- to 17-year-olds had the highest probability of being cost-effective and the highest probability of being the optimum policy at any willingness-to-pay threshold considered ( Fig. 1 B and C). Univariate Sensitivity Analysis Figure 3 D shows the univariate sensitivity analysis of adding QIV for elderly and high-risk groups with Q-LAIV for 2- to 17-year- olds. Varying the vaccination coverage in children between 20% and 80% indicated a nonlinear relationship between the coverage and the NHB, with increasing coverage resulting in relatively lower returns. Nevertheless, pediatric vaccination strategies at 80% coverage dominated strategies at 20% or 50% coverage from a societal perspective ( Appendix 2: Table 2.5-Table 2.6 found at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2020.10.011 ). A higher vaccine ef - cacy of Q-LAIV increased the average prevented number of symptomatic infections from 401 820 to 561 710 ( Appendix 2: Table 2.4 found at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2020.10.011 ) and the NHB from 119 430 to 175 263 QALYs ( Appendix 2: Table 2.7 found at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2020.10.011 ). Pediatric vaccination remained also cost-saving when a considerably higher Q-LAIV price was used. Effects Among Children If only the effects of pediatric vaccination on those aged 2-17 years were considered ( Appendix 2: Table 2.11 found at https:// doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2020.10.011 estimated QALY losses of pediatric vaccination signi cantly reduce and the net costsFigure 2.

However, the inclusion of pediatric vaccination in the vaccination program for elderly and high-risk groups remained cost-saving or cost-effective. Discussion The inclusion of childhood in fluenza vaccination in the Dutch national vaccination program for elderly and high-risk groups was estimated to prevent substantial morbidity and mortality on the population level, to be cost-saving from a societal perspective, and to be cost-effective from a payer 's perspective. Indirect protection made a pronounced contribution to the cost-effectiveness of pe- diatric vaccination, given that half of the prevented symptomatic cases and nearly all prevented deaths were among adults.Vaccination of 2- to 17-year-olds with Q-LAIV and elderly and high-risk groups with QIV was the optimum policy at any willingness-to-pay threshold considered. Pediatric vaccination was also estimated to be cost-effective when only effects of pe- diatric vaccination among children were considered. There was a nonlinear relationship between vaccine uptake in children and effects of vaccination. This is explained by the concept that once a critical uptake rate has been achieved, further increase yields diminishing returns.48Nonetheless, the economic returns of pediatric vaccination were estimated to be such that the NHB kept increasing with increasing coverage. Pediatric vaccina- tion is also likely to shift the average of in fluenza infections to an older age, because the probability of becoming infected is lower and the long-term naturally acquired immunity is replaced by short-term vaccine-acquired immunity. However, this age shift didFigure 3. Sensitivity analyses of the cost-effectiveness of pediatric in fluenza vaccination in The Netherlands from a societal perspective over a period of 20 years. Current practice concerns the invitation of all adults aged $60 years and individuals aged ,60 with certain chronic illnesses with overall uptake rates of approximately 3% in ,18 years, 8% in 18-59 years and 65% in .60 years. Added pediatric vaccination strategies assume a vaccination uptake of 50% in the indicated age group. (A-C) Results of the multivariate probabilistic sensitivity analysis(PSA), taking into account uncertainty in the transmission, clinical, and economic parameters. A set of key transmission parameters was repeatedly sampled from input distributions, and 7198 simulations were retained as they tted observed in fluenza epidemiology in The Netherlands. Results of these simulations (incidence of infection) served as an input for the economic PSA in which clinical and economicparameters were sampled from input distributions, and outcomes were compared for a range of vaccination policies. (A) The cost-effectiveness plane shows discounted incremental costs from the societal perspective and incremental QALYs accumulated over 20 years compared to no vaccination of 7198 simulations. A square represents the average across simulations, and bars represent the range in which 95% of the simulations fell. To improve the readability of the table, we only show results of the adding pediatric strategies with Q-LAIV to thecurrent practice with QIV.

LE outweigh the bene ts of pediatric vaccination as a whole, and it could also be considered a good thing, because there is a lowering of the likelihood of infection in the very young. The reduced mortality in elderly people occurred despite the already high vaccination coverages with either TIV or QIV. Also, other \"enhanced \"influenza vaccines for elderly people have recently become available on the international market, including high-dose in fluenza vaccine, MF-59 adjuvanted vaccine, and re- combinant in fluenza vaccine, each expected to have higher ef - cacy than standard IVs. However, modeling studies estimated that the absolute gains of enhanced vaccines are limited (for instance,replacing QIV with high-dose TIV in US elderly would reduce the influenza-related QALY loss by 4%49), indicating that pediatric vaccination is expected to be also cost-saving with the use of an enhanced vaccine in elderly people. As recommended by international guidelines,50,51a dynamic transmission model was used that accounts for herd immunityand gains and losses of immunity over time. The calibration pro- cedure resulted in a reasonable number of parameter sample sets, so that we arrived at a model that provides a good caricature of influenza epidemiology in The Netherlands. The multi-strain model structure allowed the modeling of cross-reactivityFigure 3. (continued) 28 VALUE IN HEALTH JANUARY 2021between viruses, although this feature was not used in the current analysis, because it was complex to include in the calibration process using epidemiological data of 4 in fluenza viruses. In re- ality, however, such mechanisms may exist, as, for instance, vaccination with TIV is estimated to offer also partial protection against the nonincluded in fluenza B lineage.25,52If true, the cur- rent study overestimates the additional impact of Q-LAIV compared to TIV. The vaccine ef cacy and duration of immunity were assumed to be constant between seasons, but in reality these parameters may vary over time because of variation in vaccine match and irregular antigenic drift. A modeling study that accounted for seasonal vari- ation in vaccine ef cacy and duration of immunity indicated that pediatric vaccination would increase the variability in epidemic size; that is, seasons with small epidemics are occasionally alter- nated with seasons with large epidemics due to a build-up of the pool of susceptibles.53Increased variability in epidemic size may reduce the impact of the pediatric vaccination program53and was associated with a small risk of an overall QALY loss.54 There is ongoing debate about the vaccine effectiveness of LAIV. Clinical trials found that the ef cacy of LAIV was superior to that of IVs,25whereas effectiveness studies found the effectiveness of LAIV to be superior, similar, or inferior to IV.29-31Use of vaccine efcacy data of LAIV in accordance with clinical trial data in the analysis resulted in a substantial higher NHB. Moreover, we assumed no difference in duration of protection between LAIV and IV, while IVs already wane through the season and LAIV may protect in a second season.55-57However, using a longer duration of protection of LAIV is expected to have limited impact on the outcomes, because in fluenza vaccination is given annually. The analysis was not risk-strati ed, although vaccination coverage and clinical and economic burden of in fluenza is relatively higher in high-risk groups.58However, we expect that use of a risk- strati ed model would have limited impact on the cost- effectiveness of pediatric in fluenza vaccination, because the pres- ence of comorbidities in children is low and evidence that herd immunity is unequally distributed across risk groups is absent.We used in fluenza-associated mortality rates that were regressed against respiratory diagnoses, while an ecological study that used all-cause mortality data found substantially higher influenza mortality rates.59However, the use of all-cause mor- tality data could also result in an overestimation of the number of deaths attributed to in fluenza, and the use of respiratory di- agnoses re flects a conservative approach. Furthermore, assumptions had to be made for the vaccine prices of Q-LAIV and QIV, as tendered prices for the Dutch setting are unavailable. However, our sensitivity analyses demonstrate that pediatric vaccination remained to be cost-saving at substan- tially higher vaccine prices. We found a higher impact of pediatric in fluenza vaccination on the overall infection attack rate compared with another modeling study from The Netherlands (28% for TIV in 50% of 2- to 17-year- olds vs 15% for Q-LAIV in 40% of 2- to-16-year-olds).53This dif- ference may be explained by differences in the model structure and a higher proportion of children effectively vaccinated in the current study. This also explains why pediatric in fluenza vacci- nation was found to be cost-saving in our study, while the other study found pediatric vaccination to be cost-effective.54Studies from surrounding European countries estimated pediatric vacci- nation to be cost-saving from a societal perspective and cost- effective from a payer 's perspective.60-62 Results of this study are relevant for policy makers deciding whether to include pediatric in fluenza vaccination in the national influenza program of The Netherlands or elsewhere, even though cost-effectiveness is not the only criterion involved in this deci- sion.18For instance, acceptability of the vaccination program is also important, because most of the bene ts were among adults via herd immunity. However, such a nonuniform distribution of advantages a vaccination program may well be acceptable whenadverse events of vaccination are mild and public health in gen- eral is substantially improved. 18 Finally, the impact of routine in fluenza vaccination in early childhood on the long-term development of immunity against influenza viruses is a matter of debate. Accumulating evidenceFigure 3. (continued) THEMED SECTION: VACCINES 29suggests that the rst in fluenza infections in life in fluence the immune response against subsequent infections (imprinting), but the impact of vaccination on imprinting is unknown.63,64LAIV is thought to be a more appropriate vaccine candidate than IV for children na\u00efve to in fluenza infections because it mimics a natural infection in the upper respiratory tract that activates mucosalantibodies and cross-protective T-cell lymphocytes. 65 Conclusion Modeling indicates that inclusion of pediatric in fluenza vaccination in the national vaccination program for elderly and high-risk groups results in a substantial reduction of in fluenza morbidity and mortality on the population level, and it would be cost-saving from a societal perspective and cost-effective from a payer 's perspective.
