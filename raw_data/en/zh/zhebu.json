The vaccine is given in two doses, three weeks apart. It's unique among the available options in the U.S. because it uses a different, more traditional vaccine technology. The vaccine introduces proteins from the virus that promote immunity in the body. As with the other COVID-19 vaccines, side effects are typically mild (i.e., fever, chills, tiredness, and headache), but some cases of heart inflammation have been reported in people who have received the Novavax vaccine.
