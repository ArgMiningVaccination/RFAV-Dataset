[Case guidelines and resources](https://paam.wildapricot.org/resources/Documents/ACAM%20Case%20Guidelines.pdf) Examination: The certification process finishes with a conversation about the applicant's case studies. This will generally last about sixty minutes and needs to be done with at least two members of ACAM, or other designated physicians. The examination will include discussion of at least one of the three cases that have been prepared. The Board will review the application, request additional information or clarification as needed, and contact the applicant to schedule a time for discussion of the clinical cases. If certification is not granted, the Board will provide feedback to the applicant, including recommendations for additional study or training. Clinical Mentoring Program The Clinical Mentoring Program provides more individualized teaching time and a focus on practical application of Anthroposophic medical therapies in your practice. The Foundation Year of clinical mentoring consists of a series of ten live, 90-minute online sessions (spaced about every 3-4 weeks, September to May), plus a special, in-person, 2\u00bd day Fall Mentoring Workshop. In these meetings you will be introduced to the philosophical and clinical foundations of Anthroposophic Medicine, while creating a clear pathway for you to bring these insights into your patient care. Topics include: dynamic observation methods learning the language of nature metamorphosis, dynamic morphology and embryology threefold physiologic patterns the fourfold nature of the human being exploring the deeper roots of health and illness first steps in prescribing Anthroposophic medicines and therapies meditative practices to support moral strength and practitioner health integrative practice management tools and sharing of successful practice models Quarterly group meetings continue during mentoring years two and three, but the majority of sessions are now devoted to paired (one-on-one) discussions with an experienced clinician mentor. The focus for these mentoring meetings is discussing cases from one's own clinical practice.
