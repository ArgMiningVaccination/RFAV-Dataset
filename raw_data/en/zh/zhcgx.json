Mental Health Staff Short by Thousands Educators are finding new ways to support student mental health in school amidst mental health staff shortages, [according to The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2023/08/31/mental-health-crisis-students-have-third-therapists-they-need/). It would take 77,000 additional school counselors; 63,000 more school psychologists; and tens of thousands of school social workers to reach the levels recommended by professional groups prior to the pandemic, say those organizations. Some universities are expanding counseling programs, schools are hiring interns and trainees, and some states, like California, are presenting scholarships to entice students into mental health professions. FDA Sends Warning Letters to Infant Formula Manufacturers The FDA sent warning letters to 3 infant formula producers over violations of federal safety regulations, [reported The Hill](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/4180125-fda-sends-warning-letters-to-three-infant-formula-manufacturers-over-federal-violations/). The letters were sent to ByHeart, Mead Johnson Nutrition, and Perrigo Wisconsin following FDA inspections of their facilities; they applied limited recalls of some products over health concerns about the bacterium Cronobacter sakasakii. The FDA said the letters are not linked to current recalls and the products presently on the market aren't a risk to consumers. The companies have to promise thorough cleaning and sanitation regiments, conduct investigations into the contaminations, and reassess company sanitation policies. They have 15 working days to create corrective plans for the FDA to review. Naloxone Is Coming to Stores Naloxone (Narcan), the first over-the-counter opioid overdose reversal medication, is being transported to drugstore and grocery chains around the country, said manufacturer Emergent BioSolutions, [according to The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/30/health/narcan-drug-stores.html). Stores like Walgreens, CVS, Walmart, and Rite Aid said they expect naloxone to be available online and on multiple store shelves in the first week of September. Scientists and health officials are hoping that medication will become commonplace in public libraries, subways, dorms, corner delis, and street vending machines. They also estimate it might become common in medicine cabinets as more people realize that illicit party drugs may be contaminated "}
