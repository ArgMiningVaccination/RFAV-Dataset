Healing crystals have been used for centuries to promote healing and balance in the body. When used in healing candles, these crystals can help to amplify the benefits of an aromatherapy candle and release their own unique energies. In addition, the crystals in the candles can be saved once the candle is done burning! The gemstones make a great keepsake that will last forever, so the candles make a great gift. Meaningful blends of crystals, gemstones, herbs, flowers, and oils The intentional crystal mix used in each of our candles is chosen based on the crystal's properties. For example, rose quartz is known for its ability to promote love and compassion, so it is likely to be used in our Love and Romance Candles. Amethyst is known for its ability to promote calmness and relaxation, so it is used in our Stress Relief, Healing Energy, and Peaceful Home candles. All natural oils and organic herbs and flowers are also used in our candles, which can help to improve your mood or create a sense of relaxation. New Moon Beginnings Candles: Made with Meaning Each New Moon Beginnings healing crystal candle is handmade with meaning and intention, making them the perfect choice for those looking to bring positive energy into their lives. The all-natural ingredients used in each candle also ensure a clean burn, unlike many mass produced candles. Whether you're looking to promote relaxation, peace, or love and compassion, New Moon Beginnings has a crystal candle that is perfect for you, a friend, or a loved one. We truly strive to make the best crystal candles possible with the highest quality ingredients and thoughtful intentions.

What Happens to the Crystals & Herbs when the Candle is Lit? Please always follow [safe candle burning practices](https://newmoonbeginnings.com/blog/how-to-safely-burn-candles/). The crystals are not flammable, and they begin to sink into the wax as soon as it melts. Once you light the wick, the wax begins to melt and the herbs sink into the wax which protects them while still adding to the scent given off by the candle and help set the intention. "}
