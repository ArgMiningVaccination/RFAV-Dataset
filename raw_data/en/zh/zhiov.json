Besides teaching and energy work, I love to work in my new garden. The butterfly pictures that you see on the site were taken by me last year when I was raising Monarch Butterflies. I can't wait until Spring to be able to plant so many more native plants for the pollinators and butterflies. I have 2 Shih Tzus, Sage and Jasper and they are my babies. I am also the mother of 2 amazing kids and 6 grandchildren. I love movies, music of any kind and on Sundays in the Fall you will find me in the recliner rooting on The Superbowl Champion Tampa Bay Buccaneers. I am always looking for new classes to take and services to offer that can enhance my client's healing and spiritual growth even more. I believe that you can never learn it all. I have always been drawn to help people so when I finally realized being an Energy Healer was my life's purpose it all made sense. Being a Reiki Master and Vogel Crystal Light Therapy Bed Practitioner allows me to fulfill that daily. Providing a relaxing and aesthetically pleasing environment, in-person and distance sessions are tailored to meet your spiritual, emotional, and physical needs. I look forward to meeting you and being a part of your healing and spiritual journey. This website uses cookies. By continuing to use this site, you accept our use of cookies. "}
