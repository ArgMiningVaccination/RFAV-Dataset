This is the first time, after many years of effort, that researchers have fully immunized any animal against malaria with a man-made vaccine, according to a report in today's issue of the journal Science. A vaccine has become something of a scientific holy grail, a prize that would save the millions of children in the underdeveloped world who die of malaria. The need for a vaccine has become even more urgent as the parasite that causes the disease has developed a resistance to drugs. The new vaccine seems to work where others failed because it stimulates a type of immune cell, called a cytotoxic lymphocyte, that previous vaccines had not engaged. These immune cells can identify and destroy cells infected with parasites or virus. Previous attempts at a vaccine focused only on increasing antibodies to malaria, which the new vaccine also accomplishes. The immune killer cells act as a second line of defense for the immune system, backing up antibodies that seek out infectious organisms. \"It is a very fine piece of work, which explains both their success and our past failures in the vaccine area,\" said Dr. James Jensen, a malaria expert at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah. \"If it extrapolates to humans -- and there is some evidence that it will -- it is a major advance.\" The mouse vaccination technique is not immediately applicable to humans, but the same types of immune cells and molecules are probably involved. \"The mouse system has predicted all along what we have been able to achieve in humans and given us clues, so I think this is very promising for the prospects of a human vaccine,\" said Dr. Steven L. Hoffman, head of the malaria branch at the Naval Medical Research Institute in Rockville, Md., an author of the new report. But other experts urged caution. \"This is important science, but it's not clear if it will translate into a vaccine for humans,\" said Dr. Louis Miller, head of the parasitology laboratory at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md. Heavy Toll Among Children Malaria is caused by a parasite that is spread by mosquitos. Worldwide, one million to two million children die of malaria each year and there are 270 million new infections, mostly in the tropics. Until recently the immune killer cells evoked by the new vaccine were not known for certain to be involved in the immune system's battle with malaria. But last year scientists found that these killer cells were active in making mice immune to malaria. And Dr. Hoffman's group reported last month in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that it had duplicated the observation in man. The new study is expected to precipitate a sea change in research on malaria vaccine. Previously, researchers had focused on how the body uses antibodies to fight malaria, and had tried to stimulate the production of antibodies by vaccination. Although the shots sometimes resulted in high levels of the immune molecules, to the chagrin of scientists they proved incapable of reliably preventing malaria. The Vaccine's Ingredients The active ingredients of the new malaria vaccine are two molecules borrowed from the surface of a malaria parasite that attacks rodents. Each molecule interacts with a different branch of the mouse's immune system, and together they prime the antibodies and killer cells to recognize the malaria parasite. One is a molecule, discovered 10 years ago, that is known to stimulate the immune system to make antibodies to malaria. Earlier malaria vaccines used this protein alone. The second molecule, newly identified by Dr. Hoffman's group and the one that sets the Navy vaccine apart from the others, stimulates the critical natural killer cells. To make the vaccine the researchers used genetic engineering techniques to place the genes encoding these two proteins inside carrier cells, which then displayed the two immune-stimulating proteins, or antigenes, on their surface. The carrier cells were a type of mouse tumor cell that had been irradiated so that it could not produce disease. Eighteen mice were inoculated with the vaccine and then injected two weeks later with a large dose of malaria parasites. None contracted the disease. Several hurdles have to be cleared before these findings can be applied to humans. Scientists must identify the human counterpart of the molecule that stimulates natural killer cells in the mouse. They believe the molecule exists in all types of malaria parasites. TOWARD A MALARIA VACCINE A newly discovered protein on the surface of a parasite that causes malaria in mice has helped make an effective vaccine for mice. A previously known protein stimulated the antibody response, but it was not enough to prevent malaria. The second protein enlists immune cells called cytotoxic lymphocytes as a second line of defense. Scientists hope the approach will work in "}
