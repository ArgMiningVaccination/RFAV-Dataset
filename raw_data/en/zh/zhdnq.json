What to Look for When Buying Glasses Online Comfort If you'll be wearing your glasses around the clock, they definitely need to be comfortable; but even if you're only planning to wear them for reading or long distances, you don't want to be stuck with glasses that pinch, slide around or fall off, sit crookedly on your face, feel too heavy on your nose, or give you a headache. \"Comfort is critical, especially if you will wear the glasses for several hours per day,\" Dr. Albanis says. Check how well your glasses fit you by assessing the way they rest on the bridge of your nose, feel behind your ears, and \"sit\" on your face to best determine if they will wear well for long periods of time. \"There shouldn't be gaps between the person's actual bridge of their nose and the bridge of the glasses; It will also often cause the glasses to slip down their face,\" says Dr. Maria Armandi, an optometrist and instructor at Pennsylvania College of Optometry at Salus University. \"If the temple length is not long enough, then the bend is not going to sit down the ear like it should so again the glasses may slide forward,\" she adds. If you're especially concerned about ordering glasses online and getting the right fit, look for retailers that offer deals on any future adjustments, says New York City-based optometrist Jonah Berman, O.D.: \"Some online [retailers] know how important adjustments can be, and offer a reimbursement of up to $20 for the actual adjustment.\" Cost Eyeglasses can be expensive, especially when they are not covered under your vision plan. \"When buying glasses, it is important to look at the full spectrum - what is most cost-effective from a financial, time and health perspective,\" says Dr. Robert C. Layman, the president of the American Optometric Association (AOA). Dr. Albanis says that a higher price tag does not always mean higher quality. The type of material and protective coating on the glasses actually better determines the quality. \"Depending on your visual needs, the eye care professional you work with should be able to explain the pros and cons to meet your needs,\" Dr. Albanis says. Also be careful about spending money for added features that you may or may not need, or ones that haven't been proven to provide much benefit. Blue light blocking lenses, for example, have become extremely popular among eyewear retailers despite the fact that they have not been proven to prevent eye disease, but Dr. Ahmad says the added feature is probably not a good use of your glasses budget. Frame Shape Not all frames are created equally, especially depending on the shape of someone's face. \"There are shape rules,\" Dr. Armandi says. \"For a round face, you shouldn't get a round frame because it will make your face look too round. If you have a very angular face, you might not want a very square looking frame or angular frame.\" There are several reasons why eyeglasses come with rules for how it should rest on the face. For one, it is so the glasses don't over or underexaggerate any facial features. \"Your frame shape should be the opposite of your face shape so you can balance out the features of your face,\" Dr. Armandi says. An optician can help guide you on what to look out for when selecting different frames for your prescription glasses. There are also rules when it comes to selecting the right lenses that will fit your frame. \"It is important to make sure that a particular frame works well with the prescribed lenses, and the doctor (or the optician) can recommend thinner, lighter lenses to improve comfort and the look, especially if someone has a special need for a stronger prescription,\" Dr. Layman says. Warranty or Return Policy Pay close attention to any retailer's policy about returning glasses if they don't work out for you\u2014while some will fully refund you, others will only give you a credit to be used towards another pair of glasses from that same company rather than giving you your money back. \"I've had people who had difficulty with return policies, even if the glasses were made incorrectly. Understand what the return policies are,\" Dr. Armandi recommends. You should also make note of any warranty information sent along with your order, in the event that your glasses don't last as long as you expect them to; there are a lot of factors that go into the lifespan of a pair of glasses, but Dr. Berman says a well-made, durable pair of glasses should come with a customer-favorable warranty. \"The material your frame is made from, the strength and flexibility of the material, the simplicity of the frame and the number of parts that are used, the method of securing the lenses to the frame, how well the frame fits your face, the ease of adjustment, and use of the eyeglass case all play a role in [determining] how long your glasses will last,\" he explains, adding that you might want to purchase a second pair of glasses as a backup in case your first pair becomes damaged. Frequently Asked Questions Do you need a prescription to buy glasses online? Yes, a prescription is necessary to buy eyeglasses online if you're looking to assist with any vision problems you might have. Glasses are medical devices regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and are not one size fits all,\" Dr. Layman says. \"Every pair of eyeglasses must be custom fitted to not only comfortably suit your face, but also to meet your particular prescriptive needs.\" Eye exams are an important tool for people to utilize so they can know the prescription that will address vision problems. Otherwise, side effects from wearing glasses with the wrong prescription could happen. \"Headaches, eye strain, and nausea can result from wearing reading glasses that are not a correct prescription. That's why doctors of optometry work with patients to not only pinpoint the correct prescription, but also identify the right type and fit,\" Dr. Layman says. How often should you replace your glasses? How often you should replace your glasses can oftentimes depend on how the frames hold up through constant use. \"Sometimes a pair of glasses can last five, six years if they are a good frame, they clean them properly,\" Dr. Armandi says. \"But people should have regular eye exams regardless of if their eyeglasses are in good shape.\" The American Optometric Association recommends for adults ages 18 to 64 to receive an eye exam at least once every two years if they are asymptomatic or low risk. High risk individuals in that age group should get an eye exam annually. Adults ages 65 years and older should get an eye exam at least once every year. \"Typically, most people will need new glasses when their prescription changes,\" Dr. Layman says.Other reasons why glasses should be replaced include if they have any scratches or dents. \"They could be affecting your vision in ways you aren't consciously aware of and potentially lead to eye strain,\" Dr. Layman says. Trouble cleaning the glasses could also indicate that you should purchase a new pair. \"The coatings on glasses can break down over time, leaving a film that makes glasses difficult to clean or even blurry,\" he adds. What the Experts Say \"Regardless of where a patient chooses to purchase, the foundation for having glasses that work well for them is really to ensure that they receive a comprehensive eye examination to assess their eye health before making a purchase. The consequences of making an incorrect or uninformed purchase could cost patients more time and money and have health implications in the long run.\" \u2014 Dr. Layman Why Trust Verywell Health As a seasoned health writer, Danielle Zoellner knows the importance of finding just the right product to fit your medical needs.
