At Align 33 Chiropractic in Northridge California we use traditional and non-force manipulations depending on what your needs are. We will adapt treatment plans to meet the specific needs of each individual patient. Spinal manipulation can be beneficial for patients suffering from lower-back pain and may also be helpful for headaches, neck pain, upper- and lower-extremity joint conditions, and whiplash-associated disorders. Spinal Manipulation (High-Velocity Low-Amplitude Thrust) The most commonly used chiropractic technique, is spinal manipulation, this is the traditional high-velocity low-amplitude (HVLA) thrust. This technic involves the practitioner using short, quick thrusts (high velocity) applied over short distances (low amplitude) to the affected areas. The manipulation often results in an audible \"pop,\" as chiropractors use their hands to apply a controlled sudden force to a joint while the body is positioned in a specific way. Spinal Mobilization (Low-Force or Gentle Chiropractic Techniques) Some conditions (such as osteoporosis), pathology or the patient's size, comfort, and preference may require more gentle approach which is more commonly referred to as spinal mobilization. Spinal mobilization like HVLA spinal manipulation is designed to restore and enhance joint function. Unlike HVLA spinal manipulation, spinal mobilization uses slow movement, usually to a firm endpoint of joint movement. For patients who prefer mild spinal mobilization that does not involve twisting of the body or a forceful thrust this may be the treatment best suited for them.
