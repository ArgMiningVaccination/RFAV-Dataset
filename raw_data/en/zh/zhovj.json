How does it work? The human body has many systems like the cardiovascular, digestive and nervous system which inter-weave and layer together to form an integrated whole. One of the more subtle ones is the meridian system - channels that penetrate all aspects of the body and carry Qi in order to sustain all other bodily systems. It's not only with the Physical that Qi interacts, it also affects emotional and psycho-spiritual levels of Being as well. Qi is the Vital Life Force that moves throughout the meridians. When this freedom of movement is impeded, Qi stagnates and results in some form of imbalance or illness. Acupuncture helps Qi to move through blockages & strengthen it where deficient. Stimulating the Acupuncture points along the meridians changes the quality and flow of Qi, allowing more freedom of flow and the easing of pain. There are many ways to increase the flow or transform Qi as it responds to different kinds of stimulation such as needling, heating with Moxa, focused meditation, Qigong and breathing exercises, acupressure, guasha, laser/light, herbs and diet.
