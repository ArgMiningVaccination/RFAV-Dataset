Oftentimes, we assume that it's a one-way track to good health, when in fact achieving a healthy lifestyle involves a conscious effort at the start of each day to better yourself physically and mentally. Progression varies from person to person, and no one journey yields the same results as another's, which is why it is necessary to forge your own path. Of course, when it comes to discovering innovative recipes that are both healthy and delicious, or developing a new fitness routine best suited for you, following other's footsteps can guide us in the right direction. But what happens when the footsteps left by those before us fade away? Or when you reach a fork in the road and cannot choose which way to go? It's easy to get lost when faced with these dilemmas. Using healing crystals can help you find your way back to your desired destination of a well-balanced life. One of the most important aspects of intentional eating is taking care of your body. When you eat clean and intentionally, you nurture your body with pure foods that provide the ultimate fuel. This fuel is then converted into the energy you use for physical activity, which makes your body stronger so you can carry on longer. As essential as intentional eating and exercise is to taking care of your body and achieving a healthy lifestyle, taking care of your mind is just as important. A strong mind can be the difference between making a good decision from a bad one\u2014such as choosing to eat processed fast food over an organic home cooked meal, or morphing yourself into your couch cushion instead of stepping outside and enjoying the fresh air. We're all guilty of falling into these pitfalls, and that's nothing to be ashamed of, however, the ultimate struggle is accepting when we've strayed from our intended path and learning how to move forward with the goals we've set for ourselves to reaffirm our healthy habits. We have a couple \"crystal secrets\" to help you stick to your goals of intentional eating or help you get back on track if you steer off path. If you're new to the idea of crystals, then think of them as a tool to cleanse your mind in the same way that clean, intentional eating cleanses your body. Use these two crystal tools to help you be clear minded and focused throughout your health and wellness journey! Crystal Tips for Intentional Eating Programming a Quartz Crystal to bring you back to your intention. Quartz crystals are crystals of manifestation and can be programmed to hold your intention so that it constantly put it out into the universe, even when you are not thinking about it. Mark the beginning of your new journey by writing your intention down on a small piece of paper while holding a quartz crystal point in your non-writing hand. Once you have written your intention, hold your crystal with both hands and state your intention aloud, affirming it to the universe, making this new lifestyle an active commitment. Choose a visible place to keep your written intention and place your crystal point on top of it. Keep a Selenite Crystal nearby to remove any self-doubt and negative thought patterns standing your way of your goals. A selenite crystal is a cleansing crystal ideal for all energy types. When you find yourself struggling to stay on track with your intentions, selenite can unblock the stagnant, negative energy holding you back and replace that with a new magnified energy you choose to place upon it. In moments of uncertainty or self-doubt, retrieve the paper upon which you wrote your intention. Hold the selenite with your non-dominant hand while holding the paper with your intention with your dominant hand. When you see your words with the selenite, it clears your energy, removes any negative thinking and refocuses you, giving you a clean slate to begin again. Connect with it daily in order to supplement the energy you invest on this new journey. When we visualize healthy living, we see the observable, physical aspects such as intentional eating, exercise and wellness practices. Focusing all of your energy on your outward appearance can inhibit you from taking care of yourself inwardly. Something as simple as setting an intention for yourself can have a remarkable impact on your inner health, which will ultimately impact your outer health. At any point in your journey, reflecting on your intentions can serve as a subtle reminder of where you started out compared to where you've gotten thus far. Program your quartz crystal to hold your intention and feed off of its energy as it motivates you to continue what you set out to do. Use the selenite frequently to give you a sense of direction and assurance that you are taking steps forward, even if you find yourself falling back occasionally. Instead of searching for the quickest shortcut to get healthy, take the scenic route and develop a new habit of enjoying intentional eating. As you become to embrace and it becomes part of your lifestyle choices, it won't seem so hard anymore. Above all, know that you are worthy, you are strong, and you are capable.", "sitename": "Energy Muse", "date": "2016-11-01", "cleaned_text": "Whether you're taking your first step on the path to a healthy lifestyle of intentional eating or have been traveling down the road for some time, place emphasis on [setting intentions](https://www.energymuse.com/blog/art-setting-intentions/) for your journey.
