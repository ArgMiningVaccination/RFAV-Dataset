The evolution of disease in the patient is critical to appreciating the special molecular characteristics of that particular type of cancer cell. The practice of cancer medicine in its broadest sense will move forward from the threshold most effectively when the science that has been accomplished and that is evolving is joined at the hip, inseparably, with clinical knowledge of the disease and how it disables the patient. Cancer Medicine-6 offers such a synthesis. Contents - Contributors - Preface - Part I Cardinal Manifestations - Chapter 1. Cardinal Manifestations of Cancer James F.
