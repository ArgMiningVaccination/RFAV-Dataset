Paraffin Candles Candles have been used for thousands of years to create ambiance, light, warmth, and fragrance. Most candles are made of paraffin wax due to their cost effectiveness in [ using a petroleum by-product.](thcag78rbm/index.html) The main health concern with traditional paraffin wax candles is that the properties of paraffin wax, a derivative of crude oil, as well as the metal core wicks traditionally used are polluting our homes. The EPA states that indoor air quality is 3 times more polluted than outdoor air quality. Paraffin contributes substantially to the decline in indoor air quality and begs for a healthier alternative. Choosing Soy Soy has become the healthier alternative! In recent years, soy and vegetable wax has been culminated and implemented in candle development. Soy wax components are completely non-toxic, unlike its competitor, paraffin wax, which emits 11 toxins documented by the American Lung Association, 2 of which are known carcinogens-toluene and benzene. Additionally, paraffin candles release petrol-carbon soot, which emanates from a burning candle damaging walls and furnishings. This soot penetrates not only furnishings, but air ducts as well, spreading fine particles of soot throughout the home. Tens of thousands of dollars' worth of damage have been reported due to this petrol-carbon soot. Homeowner's insurance companies are now investigating whether to cover the damage from soot produced by paraffin candles as mentioned on Insure.com. Soy vs. Paraffin SOY - Soy wax is made from soybeans and vegetables, both renewable resources. - Soy wax burns much cleaner and purer as it is all natural, non-toxic, and non-hazardous. - This wax is biodegradable leading to reduced landfills. - Soy wax residue can be washed away with warm water and soap. - Purchasing soy products supports the soy farmers of America, which stimulates our economy and lessens dependence on international resources. PARAFFIN - Derived from petroleum, a limited resource - The burning of paraffin wax contributes to indoor air contamination by emitting petro-chemicals causing soot deposits and carcinogenic particulate matter. - This wax contains petroleum by-products and additives that inhibit biodegradability. - Paraffin wax residue is quite troublesome, often impossible, to remove. - Purchasing paraffin products not only supports our dependence on this crude oil but also supports an industry riddled with environmental faux pas.
