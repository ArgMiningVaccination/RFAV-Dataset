TRADITIONAL CHIROPRACTIC. Traditional Chiropractic focus on goals such as decreasing muscle spasms, increasing range of motion, and the temporary reduction of pain. This is how most chiropractors practise, and most of them do a great job. This type of approach falls under the category of symptom relief/ symptom management sometimes called \" band-aid \" care. NEURO-STRUCTURAL CORRECTION At Chiropractic Life, our focus is on Neuro-Structural Correction. Think of your spine as the foundation for a building. If the foundation was off, would you expect the floors to creak, the walls to crack, and for the windows to not close properly? You can spend time patching all the damage, but you would be doing so with the expectation that in a short time the problems will have to be... Repaired again and again. Neuro-Structural Correction aims to identify the underlying Structural Shifts in the spine that may be causing your foundation to be off, and work with you to implement a care plan that addresses your health concerns. Many people report other \"symptoms\" too. We refer to these as [Secondary conditions](https://chiropracticlife.com.au/what-we-do/secondary-conditions/). It is important to distinguish between those symptoms that can appear due to a Structural Shift and those that can be due to other lifestyle factors - or indeed, both. In the majority of cases, when someone comes to our practices, often as a referral from other chiropractors, medical doctors, or other health professionals, we identify a Structural Shift through out testing protocols. GET BACK TO NORMAL Rather than constantly repairing damage, at Chiropractic Life, we focus on treating the underlying Neuro-Structural Shifts and help you get as close to Normal Structure and Neurological Function as possible for you. Our services are not for everyone. However, if you are tired of constantly patching the problem and you are looking for a long term solution that you can both feel and see for yourself, then Chiropractic Life might be the right place for you.
