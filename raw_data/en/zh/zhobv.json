Immunotherapies directed at MHC-I complexes have expanded the scope of antigens and enabled the direct targeting of intracellular on-coproteins at the cell surface. We asked whether covalent drugs that alkylate mutated residues on oncopro-teins could act as haptens to generate unique MHC-I-restricted neoantigens. Here, we report that KRAS G12C mutant cells treated with the covalent inhibitor ARS1620 ARS1620-modied peptides in MHC-I complexes. Using identied by phage display, we show that thesehaptenated MHC-I complexes can serve as tumor-specic neoantigens and that a bispecic T cell engagerconstruct based on a hapten-specic antibody elicits a cytotoxic T cell response against KRAS G12C cells, including those resistant to direct KRAS G12C inhibition. With multiple K-RAS G12C inhibitors in clinical use or undergoing clinical trials, our results present a strategy to enhance their efcacy and overcome the rapidlyarising tumor resistance. INTRODUCTION Targeting of tumor- or tissue-specic cell surface antigens is a central tenet of antibody-based ( Bargou et al., 2008 ), cell-based (June et al., 2018 ), and chemically mediated cancer immuno- therapy ( McEnaney et al., 2012 ). While the search for such tu- mor-specic cell surface antigens has been extensive ( Schu- macher and Schreiber, 2015 ), few have been identied over the last 30 years. Oncogenic driver mutations, by contrast, arevery common and are exclusively expressed in tumor cells but not normal tissues. However, the vast majority of mutant onco- proteins are intracellular and thus beyond the reach of anti-body-based therapeutic modalities. Targeting oncogene-derived peptide fragments (neoantigens) presented by class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC class I) using T cell re- ceptor-mimicking antibodies is a promising strategy ( Chang et al., 2017 ;Dao et al., 2013 ;Hsiue et al., 2021 ;Li et al., 2017 ; Low et al., 2019 ), but it is challenging to identify antibodies spe- cic for a single amino acid substitution in the context of a partic-ular MHC class I (human leukocyte antigen [HLA]) allele. Somatic that introduce a cysteine residue, such as KRASp.G12C , that can be covalently targeted by cell-permeable drugs provide an opportunity for simplied antibody recognition of cancer cells. If the covalently modied K-Ras(G12C) oncopro-tein could undergo antigen processing and presentation, then it would produce peptide-MHC class I complexes that contain the drug as a molecular feature (hapten) readily recognizable bytherapeutic antibodies. In addition, the formation of these MHC class I complexes would benet from increased MHC class I expression as a result of K-Ras inhibition ( Canon et al., 2019 ;Ya- mamoto et al., 2020 ). Here, we report that covalent modication of K-Ras(G12C) at the tumor-specic cysteine results in the presentation of hapten-ated peptides by MHC class I. Using a naive human Bcell-derived Fab (fragment antigen binding)-phage library ( Duriseti et al., 2010 ), we identied recombinant antibody, P1A4, that specically peptides modiedby the investigational inhibitor ARS1620. A bispecic T cell en- gager (BiTE) constructed from this antibody clone selectively induced a cytolytic T cell response that killed ARS1620-resistantKRAS G12C mutant cells in vitro . Our study demonstrates that MHC class I peptides derived from covalently modied 1060 Cancer Cell 40, 1060-1069, September 12, 2022 \u00aa2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

These neoantigens, bearing a distinctchemical modication, can be readily targeted with an immune cell killing modality that overcomes tumor resistance to direct target inhibition. RESULTS ARS1620 modied K-Ras G12C peptides are competent for antigen presentation KRAS G12C is one of the most prevalent oncogenic driver muta- tions in lung and colon cancer ( Prior et al., 2012 ). While covalent inhibitors (e.g., sotorasib/AMG510 [ Canon et al., 2019 ;Fakih et al., 2019 ], adagrasib [ Papadopoulos et al., 2019 ], JNJ- 74699157 [ Janssen Research & Development, 2020 ], LY3499446 [ Eli Lilly and Company, 2021 ], ARS1620 [ Janes et al., 2018 ]) that specically react with the acquired cysteine (Cys12) residue have been reported to rapidly engage cellularK-Ras(G12C) proteins and drive tumor regression in mouse models and clinically ( Fakih et al., 2019 ;Janes et al., 2018 ), not all patients with a KRAS G12C mutation respond to K-Ras(G12C) inhibitors ( Canon et al., 2019 ;Fakih et al., 2019 ). Clinical resistance to both sotorasib and adagrasib have already been observed ( Awad et al., 2021 ;Koga et al., 2021 ;Tanaka et al., 2021 ), mechanisms including on the wild-type (WT) KRAS allele in trans . However, most resistant tumors retain the expression of KRAS G12C (Awad et al., 2021 ). Therefore, an immunotherapy that targets the KRAS G12C mu- tation would likely circumvent these resistance mechanisms and benet a large patient population. We hypothesized that a covalently modied K-Ras(G12C) pro- tein could be processed by the antigen presentation machinery to generate tumor-specic neoepitopes. Although MHC class I presentation of mutant K-Ras peptides has been observed in pa-tients ( Tran et al., 2016 ;Wang et al., 2016 ), it remains unknown whether a covalently attached inhibitor would interfere with anti- gen processing and subsequent binding to MHC class I com-plexes. We chose to address this question using the investiga-tional K-Ras(G12C) inhibitor ARS1620, as it was an advanced drug candidate with the most published data available at the time of our investigation ( Figure 1 A). We focused on two com- mon MHC class I alleles, HLA-A*02:01 and HLA-A*03:01, for which K-Ras peptide epitopes containing the mutant cysteine have been reported in the Immune Epitope DataBase (IEDB).We synthesized peptides KLVVVGAC*GV introduce ARS1620 onto Cys12. These two ARS1620-modied peptides readily formed functional MHC class I complexes with HLA-A*02:01 and HLA-A*03:01, respectively, in an in vitro MHC refolding assay ( Kristen- sen et al., 2002 ) in which complex formation was detected by a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) ( Fig- K5-ARS peptide stabilized HLA- A*02:01 expression on the surface of T2 cells, which express HLA-A*02:01 but are decient in the transporter associated with antigen processing ( TAP) genes and only form functionalMHC complexes with exogenously supplied cognate peptides (Stuber et al., 1992 ,1994 )(Figure 1 C). The introduction of ARS1620 onto the K5 peptide resulted in slightly reduced ther- mal stability (T m= 39.2/C14C) compared to by differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) with recombinant MHC class I complexes ( Figure 1 D). Together, these results conrm that K-Ras peptides can bebound by two common MHC class I alleles and that inhibitor modication of the peptide is tolerated by the peptide-binding cleft in the alleles examined. Identication and characterization of ARS1620-specic antibodies To enable the therapeutic targeting of ARS1620-modied pep- tide epitopes, we used a naive human B cell-derived Fab-phagelibrary consisting of 4.1 310 10unique clones to discover anti- body fragments that specically bind pep- tides ( Duriseti et al., 2010 an N-terminal biotin (Biotin-GAC*GVGKSAL) immobilized on beads. To enrich for binders that recognize ARS1620, we also performed negative selectionsusing the unmodied peptide (Biotin-GACGVGKSAL). After 4 rounds of selection, we screened 186 phage clones by ELISA and Sanger sequenced the binding clones. We identied veunique Fabs and expressed them recombinantly for biophysical and biochemical characterization. All 5 clones showed specic and high-afnity binding to an ARS1620-labeled peptide, with af-nities ranging from 14 to 51 nM ( Figure S1 B). One clone, P1A4, featured a relatively short heavy-chain complementarity-deter- mining region 3 (CDR3; Figure 2 A), as well as a remarkable selec- tivity for the Satropisomer of ARS1620 ( Figure S1 A). We reasoned that the short CDR3 loop may create a concave pocket privileged for hapten recognition and therefore chose this clone for further study. P1A4 exhibits similarly high afnities for the ARS1620-modi- ed K5 peptide (K5-ARS) both as a free peptide (58 nM) and when presented in the A*02:01 MHC class I complex (62 nM)(Figures 2 B and 2C). P1A4 also showed high afnity for the V7- ARS A*03:01 MHC class I complex (25 nM), conrming that it is able to bind ARS1620 in MHC class I complexes without a reduction in binding potency ( Figure 2 D). We further conrmed the specicity of P1A4 for ARS1620 by DSF: P1A4 was stabilized both by an ARS1620-labeled peptide and by free ARS1620, with its melting temperature increasing by 5.6 /C14C and 6.2/C14C, respec- tively ( Figure S1 C). Only relatively minor thermal stabilization (3.5/C14C) was observed for P1A4, with a peptide labeled with the Ratropisomer of ARS1620, P1A4 spe- cic interactions with ARS1620 ( Figure S1 C). The effect of the peptide carrier sequence on P1A4 binding was further tested by biolayer interferometry using a suite of peptides modiedwith ARS-1620. P1A4 showed similar afnity to all of the labeledpeptides tested in this assay ( Figure S1 E). Together, these data conrm that ARS1620 serves as the major antigenic determinant of P1A4. To elucidate the structural details of the interaction between P1A4 and ARS1620, we solved a 2.0-A crystal structure of the P1A4 Fab bound to a reduced, non-electrophilic analog ofll OPEN ACCESS Report Cancer Cell 40, 1060-1069, September 12, 2022 1061ARS1620A N N F F OHClN N OHS N investigational inhibitor ARS1620 form functional complexes with MHC class I heavy chain and b2-microglobulin (A) Conjugate addition from the acquired cysteine (Cys12) on K-Ras(G12C) to the acrylamide group a covalent ARS1620-K-Ras(G12C) a dduct.

With its hydroxyfluorophenyl moiety anchoring deep in the pocket through hydrogen bonding of theheavy-chain CDR3, ARS1620 positions its electrophilic acryl- amide group toward the solvent, making little to no direct contact with the Fab. This binding pose is consistent with the carrier-agnostic binding prole of P1A4 and suggests that P1A4 maybe able to bind a wide variety of antigens where ARS1620 is ste- rically accessible. Having characterized P1A4 as an ARS1620-binding Fab using model antigens and X-ray crystallography, we next character- ized it in the context of drug-modied full-length K-Ras. detected ARS1620-modied, SDS-denatured K-Ras(G12C) both as a recombinant protein and in cell lysates, but it did notcross-react with unmodied K-Ras ( Figure 2 F), making it a useful tool to track K-Ras(G12C) target engagement in complex samples. We next asked whether P1A4 was specic for ARS1620- haptenated MHC class I complexes. We repeated the in vitro MHC-I refolding ELISAs detailed above using a P1A4 IgG-HRP P1A4 was able to bind ARS1620-labeled, K-Ras-derived MHC class I complexes but showed no binding to matched unlabeled complexes, further conrming its specicity for ARS1620 ( Figures 2 G and S2). P1A4 also bound T2 cells treated with K5-ARS, the peptide previously identied to stabilize MHC class I expression on the cell surface, conrming that P1A4 effectively binds these haptenated MHC class I com-plexes on cells as well as in vitro (Figure 2 H). KRAS G12C cells present ARS1620-modied peptides in MHC class I We next turned to KRAS G12C cancer cell lines to test whether treatment with ARS1620 would result in native processing andloading of haptenated K-Ras peptides into MHC class I com-plexes in live cells. We rst tested whether ARS1620 could be detected at the cell surface of ARS1620-treated cells using flow cytometry. P1A4 binding was minimal with DMSO treat-ment, and a strong increase in staining was observed upon ARS1620 treatment, conrming that the inhibitor is present at the cell surface of treated cells ( Figures 3 A and 3B). As this signal could arise both from haptenated MHC class I complexes and from non-specic direct labeling of membrane proteins, we used P1A4 to immunoprecipitate ARS1620 in three KRAS G12C cell lines Miapaca-2, and SW1573) to measure the association with MHC class I proteins. Immunoprecipitated ARS1620 showed association with both b2-microglobulin and MHC class I heavy chains in all three cell lines ( Figure 3 C). ARS1620 colocalization with MHC class I complexes was further conrmed via a proximity ligation assay (PLA) in which colocali- zation of two identied through a fluorescent ARS1620 and MHC class I were de- tected in all of the KRAS G12C cell lines but not in a WT KRAScell line ( Figure 3 D). The KRAS WT cell line 786-O showed no co- localization in this assay despite having the same A*03:01 allele as H358, further corroborating that the signal arising from this assay is from K-Ras(G12C)-derived complexes. Overall, theseresults indicate that ARS1620-modied K-Ras(G12C) is natively processed, and the resulting peptides are presented by cognate MHC class I complexes in cell lines. Our results suggest that an-tigen-processing steps such as proteolytic degradation, trans-porter associated with antigen processing (TAP)-dependent peptide transport to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and MHC class I binding tolerate the presence of ARS1620-labeledcysteine residues. ARS-1620 targeted immunotherapies show efcacy against KRAS G12C cell lines, those resistant to inhibitor monotherapy Not all KRAS G12C mutant cells are sensitive to direct chemical inhibition of K-Ras. For example, we and others ( Janes et al., 2018 ;Misale et al., 2019 ) have found that the lung alveolar cell carcinoma cell line SW1573 is notably resistant to ARS1620 treatment ( Figure 4 A). Although SW1573 cells express K-Ras(G12C), they have been characterized as partially inde- pendent of K-Ras by small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting(Misale et al., 2019 ), which may explain the lack of efcacy of ARS1620. To test whether immunotargeting of a hapten adduct could be a viable approach to overcome this intrinsic drug resis- tance, we converted P1A4 into a BiTE that joins a CD3-bindingsingle-chain variable fragment (scFv, clone L2K-07; Dreier et al., 2002 ) and an derived from P1A4 with a short peptide linker (P1A4xCD3). We rst pulse treated SW1573 cells with10mM ARS1620 for 4 h, a duration that is sufcient for complete covalent engagement with cellular K-Ras(G12C) ( Janes et al., 2018 ;Misale et al., 2019 ), and after washing out the drug, we added unstimulated peripheral mononuclear blood cells (PBMCs) as effector cells = in the pres- ence of P1A4xCD3. Whereas the ARS1620 pulse treatment by it-self inhibited cell growth by 44% \u00b1 7%, inclusion of 10 nMP1A4xCD3 inhibition of 82% \u00b1 4% ( Figure 4 B). T cell activation, as analyzed by CD69 expression, was evident in the PBMCs co-cultured with SW1573 in the presence ofP1A4xCD3, but not those treated with no antibody ( Figure 4 C). This cell-killing activity was dependent on the dose of ARS1620 and effective against all three KRAS G12C mutant cell lines examined ( Figure 4 D). To select for a highly resistant population, we further conditioned SW1573 cells with high con- centrations of ARS1620 (10 mM) over 14 days. We then removed the drug and treated the cells with P1A4xCD3 without additionalpulse treatment. These conditioned cells proliferated at a rate comparable to that of drug-naive cells ( Figure S4 presence ofP1A4xCD3 ( Figure 4 E). In addition to intrinsic resistance, recent clinical trials of sotorasib and adagrasib have revealed a multitude of acquiredmechanisms of resistance after patients received K-Ras(G12C) inhibitor treatment ( Awad et al., 2021 ; (H) ARS1620-modied peptide-stabilized MHC complexes on the surface of the TAP-decient cell line T2 are detectable by the conformational specic a ntibody W6/32 (left y axis) as well as by P1A4 (right y axis) (1-way ANOVA with Dunnett's correction comparisons; ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0. 0001).

For example, in some pa- tients, a secondary G12V mutation was detected on the trans allele of KRAS of treatment-resistant tumor cells, which confers resistance to covalent G12C inhibitors. These tumor cells, how- ever, retained the expression of K-Ras(G12C) protein ( Awad et al., 2021 ). To assess whether our approach is effective against clinically observed drug-resistant mutations, we constructed a cell line (H358-G12V) that constitutively expresses both theendogenous gene intro- duced by stable transfection. Compared to the parent cell line, H358-G12V was less sensitive to ARS1620 single-agent treat- ment ( Figure S4 B). However, H358-G12V cells by P1A4xCD3 (10 nM) and PBMCs following an ARS1620 (10 mM) pulse remained effective, leading to a 77% \u00b1 4% inhibition of cell growth ( Figure 4 F). A DB CFigure 3.

To assess whether we could detect ARS1620-derived epitopes in KRAS G12C tumor xenografts, we treated nude bearing xenografts of H358 cells with ARS1620 (200 mg/kg, once daily) and analyzed dissected tumor tis-sue after 24 or 72 h. We observed treat- ment-dependent staining by P1A4 IgG (Figure 4 G), which was selective for H358 (HLA-ABC +) cells. Minimal P1A4 binding was observed in the murine (HLA-ABC/C0) cell population, further con- rming the requirement for both KRAS G12C mutation and appropriate MHC class I haplotype for the presentation of ARS1620. P1A4 did not stain tumorcells from mice treated with sotorasib (AMG510), a US Food and Drug Admin- istration (FDA)-approved K-Ras(G12C)inhibitor with a chemical structure similar to that of ARS1620. DISCUSSION It has long been appreciated that MHC class I molecules can present peptidesbearing post-translational modications (glycosylation [ Haurum et al., 1999 ], phosphorylation [ Zarling et al., 2000 ], among others [ Engelhard et al., 2006 ]). Peptide neoepitopes resulting from the covalent modication of self-proteins have been largely studied for their role in the mechanism of drug hypersensitivity reactions ( Pichler, 2003 ). Our study explores a unique class of tumor-specic anti- gens, those in which a somatic mutation to cysteine is produced in an oncogenic driver, K-Ras (G12C) which be MHC class I-restricted tumor-specic epitopes have been successfully targeted using recombinant antibodies (Dao et al., 2013 ;Hsiue et al., 2021 ), our study demonstrates that the scope of therapeutically targetable MHC class I epi- topes can be expanded to include those modied with covalent small molecules. In our example, we showed that P1A4 recog-nizes ARS1620-haptenated MHC class I complexes in thell OPEN ACCESS Report Cancer Cell 40, 1060-1069, September 12, 2022 1065BC D E FGA Figure 4.

Importantly, because our approach does not rely on inhibiting oncogenic signaling, it can retain ef- cacy even against cancer cells that are resistant to directpharmacological inhibition. This could offer a means to reclaim the therapeutic efcacy of targeted covalent inhibitors after resistance develops. A recent study that evaluated resistancemechanisms in a cohort of patients who were initially respon-sive to adagrasib treatment indicated a wide variety of resis- tance mechanisms, including mutation of the WT KRAS allele allele, and pathways NRAS ,BRAF . Critically, the G12C mutation was still pre- sent in 84% of the patient samples evaluated ( Awad et al., 2021 ). Similar secondary mutations were found in another study with patients receiving sotorasib ( Zhao et al., 2021 ), and KRAS G12C was detected in 33/43 patients after treat- ment. These results indicate that the majority of inhibitor-resis- tant cancers retained the KRAS G12C immunotherapy targeting the inhibitor-modied cysteine resi- due could be a generally feasible approach to combat acquired resistance to pharmacological inhibition. The scope of this approach also includes haptens that are not inhibitors: The approach can theoretically work as long as the hapten can selectively modify a mutant oncoprotein, even onewithout enzymatic activity. Our design strategy and discovery pipeline may be applicable to many oncogenic mutations for which covalent ligands can be developed ( Visscher et al., 2016 ), particularly the recurrent somatic present in roughly 5% of all cancers. Our work indicates that hapten-like behavior of co-valent drugs can be repurposed for the generation of neoanti- gens amenable to immunotargeting. Limitations of the study One important limitation of the current system is that P1A4 binds free ARS1620 with high afnity, which precludes its further eval-uation in animal models in which large amounts of circulating ARS1620 are present ( Figure S3 ). We expect that it is possible to overcome this limitation with subsequent antibody engineer-ing - we have recently identied an additional antibody with improved selectivity for the V7-ARS ,A*03:01 MHC class I com- plex over drug-modied peptide alone, which shows a greatlyreduced sensitivity to free drug competition ( Figures S3 and S5). Another limitation of the present study was performed with an early-stage investigational drug (ARS1620), the most advanced K-Ras(G12C) inhibitor at the initiation of our work.However, our design strategy and discovery pipeline can be rapidly and directly applied for more advanced drug candidates. For example, we have recently identied six distinct antibodiesthat recognize K-Ras(G12C)-derived binds V7-sotorasib ,A*03:01 MHC class I complex with a K Dof 15 \u00b1 0.6 nM, but not free V7-sotorasib peptide itself ( Figures S6 B-S6D). These new antibodies directly address the limitations above and representexciting leads for additional investigations on their therapeutic potential.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS Cell lines NCI-H358, Miapaca-2, SW1573, and 786-O cells were obtained U/mL streptomycin (Gibco). T2 cells (174 x CEM.T2) were obtained from ATCC and maintained in IMDM (ATCC) + 20 % PBMCs were pur- chased from StemCell Technologies, which were collected from healthy donors with institutional review board approval. All cell lines were tested mycoplasma negative using MycoAlert /C212Mycoplasma Detection Kit (Lonza). Mice Six-to seven-week-old female nude mice (NCr- Foxn1 nu) were purchased from Taconic Biosciences and housed with ad libitum food and water on a 12-h light cycle at the UCSF Preclinical Therapeutics Core vivarium. All animal studies were performed in full accor-dance with UCSF Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC protocol n. AN179937). METHOD DETAILSIdentication of fabs from phage display libraries We used a previously described human na \u00a8ve B-cell phage display library with a diversity of 4.1 310 10to identify Fabs against ARS1620 ( Duriseti et al., 2010 ). Fabs were isolated using a previously described protocol ( Kim et al., 2011 ). Briefly, the antigen Biotin-GAC(ARS1620)GVGKSAL, was immobilized streptavidin magnetic beads (Invitrogen) and exposed to the Fab-phage library for four rounds ofpanning. Negative selection was done in rounds 3 and 4 with the cognate K-Ras peptide without ARS1620 modication in the or with the cognate V7 WT MHC I complex in the case of MHC I-based panning. After four rounds of selection, individual clones were screened in an ELISA for binding to the target antigen. Clones with a positive signal weresequenced and unique clones were expressed in BL21(DE3) E. Coli and puried for further analysis. ELISA screen for fab identication Two 96-well plates loaded with 150 mL of 2xYT AG media (100 mg/mL ampicillin, 2% glucose) were inoculated with individual Fab-phage TG1 colonies and grown overnight at 37 /C14C. The following day, a 96-pin replicator was used to inoculate overnight cultures into 160 mL of 2xYT with 100 mg/mL ampicillin and 0.1% glucose in 96 well plates, and cultures were grown at 37/C14Ct oO D 600=/C240.6. Fab expression was induced through addition of 40 mL of 2xYT with 100 mg/mL ampicillin and 5 mM IPTG to each well and expression proceeded overnight at 30/C14C. The following day, the cultures were spun at 2,000 x gfor 10 min to pellet cells and crude supernatantsContinued REAGENT or RESOURCE SOURCE IDENTIFIER Recombinant DNA Plasmid: pcDNA3.1-3xFLAG-KRAS-G12V Generated in this Study N/A Plasmid: All reported Fabs and their derivates (ScFv, BiTE, IgG) Generated in this https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/ll OPEN ACCESS Report Cancer Cell 40, 1060-1069.e1-e7, September 12, 2022 e2were combined with 5% BSA PBS to a nal concentration of 1% BSA and used directly for ELISA analysis (referred to as Fab expres- sion supernatant below). 50 mL of streptavidin (5 mg/mL in PBS) was added to each well of a clear Maxisorp 96-well plate (Nunc) and the plate was incubated overnight at 4/C14C. The following day, the wells were washed 2 times with PBS and blocked with 370 mLo f2 % BSA PBS at RT for 1 h. Wells were washed 3 times with PBS, biotinylated antigen (K-Ras peptide: 1 mM in 2% plexes: ve ug/mL in 1% BSA PBS) was added, and the plate was incubated at RT with shaking for 45 min. Wells were washed 3 times with PBS, 50 mL of the Fab expression supernatant in 1% BSA PBS was added, and the plate was incubated at RT with shaking for 1 h. Wells were then washed 3 times with 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS, and 50 mL added and the plate was incubated with shaking for 1 h at RT. Wells werethen washed 3x with 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS, and 1x with PBS before addition of 50 mL Pierce Turbo TMB to each well. Plates were shaken at RT for 15 min before quenching with 15 mL of 2.5 M H 2SO 4. Absorbance was measured at 450 nm on a BioTek Synergy H4 plate reader. Fab expression 50 mL of 2xYT AG media (100 mg/mL ampicillin, 2% glucose) were inoculated with transformed BL21(DE3) E. coli colonies. and the cultures were grown overnight at 30/C14C. Starter cultures were diluted to OD 600/C240.05 in 1 L of 2xYT +0.01% glucose + ampicillin (100 ug/mL) and grown at 37/C14Ct oa nO D 600of 0.6. Protein expression was induced with 1 mM IPTG, and the culture was shaken at 20/C14C overnight. The periplasmic protein fraction, which contains the expressed Fabs, was isolated via an osmotic shock protocol. Briefly,E. coli cultures were centrifuged at 6,500 x gfor 10 min, and the pellets were resuspended in 20 mL ice-cold TES buffer (0.2 M Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.5 M sucrose) and incubated on ice for 15 min before addition of 20 mL of ice-cold MilliQ water supplemented with protease inhibitors (cOmplete protease inhibitor cocktail, EDTA-free, Roche) and gentle rocking for 30 min. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation and supernatants taken for Ni-NTA Fabs were dialyzed in PBS and further puried via size exclusion FPLC on an AKTA autopurication system (General Electric) using a Superdex 200 10/300GL column using an isocratic PBS mobile phase. Fractions were analyzed with SDS-PAGE in reducing and non-reducing conditions and concentrations determined by absorbance at 280 nm using calculated extinction coefcients(https://web.expasy.org/protparam/ ). Kinetic measurements via octet Kinetic constants for Fabs were determined using an Octet RED384 instrument (ForteBio). For screens, a single concentration of Fab (100 nM) was tested, and for kinetic characterization Fabs were tested at several concentrations, as noted in the relevant gure. Bio- tinylated peptides (1 mM in ForteBio streptavidin SA biosensors for all assays. All measurements were performed in 1% BSA PBS pH 7.4 in 384 well plates. Data wereanalyzed using a 1:1 interaction model with global tting on the ForteBio data analysis software (9.0.0.6). K Dvalues were determined by the tting of either equilibrium or maximum response (nm) as a function of Fab concentration. MHC-I refolding and purication MHC heavy chain and beta-2 microglobulin (B2m) were expressed and puried following a previously reported protocol ( Rodenko et al., 2006 ). Refolding reactions were performed with various peptides of interest in refolding buffer (100 mM Tris pH 8.0, 400 mM L-Arginine ,HCl, 5 mM reduced glutathione, 0.5 mM oxidized glutathione, 2 mM EDTA, and cOmplete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche)). Briefly, B2m (2 mM) and peptide (10 mM) were diluted into refolding buffer, then denatured heavy chain was added to 1mM. Reactions proceeded at 10/C14C either overnight for ELISA assays or for 72 h for large-scale preparations. In the latter case, MHC-I complexes were puried by size exclusion chromatography as described above in Fab expression using an isocratic method with a Tris buffer (20 mM, pH = 7.0, 150 mM NaCl). FPLC fractions were tested via SDS-PAGE and an anti-MHC-I described below. MHC-I ELISAs Black, 384 well Nunc Maxisorp plates were coated with 50 mL of the anti-heavy chain antibody W6/32 (Bio X Cell Cat# BE0079, RRI- D:AB_1107730) at 5 ug/mL in PBS overnight. The plate was washed twice with PBS (100 mL) and blocked with 3% BSA PBS (120 mL) for 1 h at RT. Plates were then washed 3x with 0.05% Tween 20 PBS (PBST) (100 mL). Refolded MHC complexes or FPLC puried) were diluted 10x into 1% BSA PBS and 50 mL added to wells in quadruplicate. Plates were incubated at RT with shaking for 1 h, then washed 3x with 1% BSA PBS (100 mL). Complexes were detected with either the anti-B2m HRP conjugate (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Cat# sc-13565, RRID:AB_626748) MHC-I complexes, P1A4 IgG-HRP conjugate to detect targetable ARS1620 in these complexes. For both antibodies, 50 mLo f1 mg/mL antibody solution in 1% BSA PBS was added to each well. Plates were incubated RT with shaking for 1 h. Plates were then washed 3x with PBST and 3x with PBS. 50 mL of the HRP substrate QuantaBlu (Thermo Fisher Scientic) was then added and activity measured continuously for 45 min at 325/420 nm in aBioTek Synergy H4 plate reader. Endpoint fluorescence readings were also taken after 1 h of development. Competition ELISA with ARS1620 and AMG510 The competition ARS1620 ELISA was carried out as described above with the addition of free ARS1620 to the P1A4 or P2B2 antibody incubation step. Free ARS1620 was combined with P1A4 or P2B2 IgG-HRP and exposed to immobilized, refolded complexes forll OPEN ACCESS Report e3 Cancer Cell 40, 1060-1069.e1-e7, September 12, 20221.5 h at RT. Free ARS1620 concentration ranged from 0.4 nM to 1 mM for P1A4 and 24 nM to 25 uM for P2B2. All other steps are as described above. The competition AMG510 ELISA was carried out as described above with the following changes: The plate was coated with streptavidin (5 ug/mL, PBS) overnight at 4/C14C. was added in triplicate to blocked, streptavidin-coated wells. Binding to MHC I complex was determined with the indi-cated clones in Fab format, at their respective K D's and detected with with free AMG510 with concentrations from 50 uM to 0.05 nM prior to addition to captured MHC I complex. All other steps are as described above. Peptide synthesis Peptides were synthesized using a Syro II peptide synthesizer (Biotage) using standard Fmoc solid phase synthesis. All peptides were synthesized at 12.5 mmol scale using preloaded Wang resin at ambient temperature. All coupling reactions were done with 4.9 eq. of O-(1H-6-chlorobenzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluoro-phosphate (HCTU), in 500 mlo fN,N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). amino position was double-coupled with 8-minute reactions. Fmoc protected N-termini were deprotected with 500 ml 40% 4-methypiperidine in DMF for 3 min, followed by 500 ml 20% 4-methypiperidine in DMF for 10 min and six washes with 500 ml of DMF for 3 min. Biotinylation of the N-terminus was performed on resin using 5 eq biotin, HCTU, (NMP) with two couplings of 30 minutes each. Peptides were cleaved off resin using 500 ml of cleavage acid (TFA), 2.5% water 2.5% triisopro- pylsilane) with shaking for 1 hour before immediate precipitation in 45 mL of ice-cold 1:1 diethyl ether:hexanes. Precipitated peptideswere pelleted, the supernatants were decanted, and the pellets were allowed to dry at RT overnight. Crude peptides were solubilized in 1:1:1 DMSO:acetonitrile:water with 0.1% on a Agilent Pursuit 5 C18 column (5 mm bead size, 150 321.2 mm) using an Agilent PrepStar 218 series preparative high-performance liquid chromatography suite. The mobile phase consisted of waster (0.1% TFA) and an increasing from 20% to 80%. Sol- vent was under reduced atmosphere using a GeneVac EZ-Bio Personal Evaporator and 50 mM DMSO stocks were made based on the gross peptide mass. Purity was conrmed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry below. Stockswere modication of peptides with ARS1620 and AMG510 were done in solution with previously puried peptides. 100 ul of 50 mM peptide solution was added to 100 ml of 100 mM ARS1620 or AMG510 and 15 ml neat diisopropylethyl- amine (DIEA) in 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes. Reactions mixtures were rotated for 1 h at RT and reactions were stopped by the additionof 20 mL TFA. Products were then puried as described above. LC-MS analysis of synthetic peptides An aliquot (1 mL) of the peptide solution (typically 10 mM) was diluted with 100 mL 1:1 acetonitrile:water. 1 mL of the diluted solution was injected onto a Waters Acquity UPLC BEH C18 1.7 mm column and linear gradient of 5-95% acetonitrile/water (+0.1% formic acid) over 3.0 min. Chromatograms were recorded with a UV detector set at 254 nm and a time-of-flight mass spec- trometer (Waters Xevo G2-XS). Differential scanning were made on a Bio-Rad C1000 qPCR system in FRET mode. Fab (2 mM) was added to either DMSO or an- tigen (50 mM) with 5x SYPRO dye and plated in triplicate in a white, 96 well PCR plate in PBS. MHC-I complexes (2 uM) were com- bined with 5x SYPRO dye in Tris buffer (20 mM, pH = 7.0, 150 mM NaCl) and plated in quadruplicate in a white, 96 well PCR plate. The temperature was initially kept at 23 /C14C for 5 min before slow ramping in 0.5/C14C increments every 30s. Raw data was normalized from 0 to 1 before tting as described above. Expression of P1A4 IgG DNA fragments encoding the light chain and heavy chain of the P1A4 Fab were cloned into pTT5 expression vector. The vector waspreviously engineered to contain an articial signal peptide sequence (METDTLLLWVLLLWVPGSTG), as well as the human IgG1 constant region, which can be removed with appropriate enzymes for constructing the light chain expression plasmid. Expi293 cells (Gibco) were maintained in Expi293 Expression Medium. On the day before transfection, cells were diluted to 2.0 310 6/mL. Trans- fection was performed with ExpiFectamine reagent following the manufacturer's instructions using 1 mg plasmid per mL culture (0.5mg heavy chain-encoding plasmid and 0.5 mg light chain-encoding plasmid). After 7 days, cells were pelleted by centrifugation (4,000 x g, 5 min) and the culture supernatant was ltered through a 0.2- mm PES membrane lter. The ltrate was incubated with Protein A agarose beads (50% slurry, 0.05 mL settled beads per mL culture) at 4/C14C for 12 h. The beads were collected in a disposable plastic column (Bio-Rad) while the unbound proteins were collected in the flowthrough fraction. The beads were washed with 20 mL 1x TBS, then was eluted with 5.0 mL 100 mM Glycine pH 2.6. The eluted fraction was immediately neutralized with 1 mL 1 M Tris 8.0.After concentrating to /C241 mL in volume, the eluted IgG was puried by size exclusion chromatography (Superdex200, PBS 7.4). Expression of P1A4 BiTE A DNA fragment encoding the variable regions of P1A4 heavy chain and light chain linked by a flexible linker (ASSGGSTSGSGKPGSGEGSSGSARDIVMS) was constructed by overlap extension PCR. An anti-CD3 scFv sequence (clone L2K-07) was synthe- sized as a gene fragment (Twist Bioscience). These two fragments were joined by a GGGGS linker and cloned into pcDNA3.4 vectorll OPEN ACCESS Report Cancer Cell 40, 1060-1069.e1-e7, September 12, 2022 e4by Gibson assembly. Expi293 cells (Gibco) were maintained in Expi293 Expression Medium. On the day before transfection, cells were diluted to 2.0 3106/mL. Transfection was performed with ExpiFectamine reagent following the manufacturer's instructions us- ing 1 mg plasmid per mL culture. After 7 days, cells were pelleted by centrifugation (4,000 x g, 5 min) and the culture supernatant was ltered through a 0.2- mm PES membrane lter. Imidazole was added to 5 mM, and the ltrate was incubated with Co-TALON agarose beads (50% slurry, 0.05 mL settled beads per mL culture, pre-washed with 20 column volumes of PBS +5 mM imidazole) at 4/C14C for 1 h. The beads were collected in a 1.5 312 cm disposable plastic column (Econo-Pac, Bio-Rad) while the unbound proteins were collected in the flowthrough fraction. The beads were washed with 20 mL PBS +5 mM imidazole, then was eluted with 5.0 mLPBS +300 mM imidazole. After concentrating to /C241 mL in volume, the eluted BiTE was puried by size exclusion chromatography (Superdex200, antibody conjugation kit (Expedeon Inc.) following the manufacturer's instructions.

T2 cells (174 x CEM.T2) were obtained in PBMCs were pur- chased from StemCell Technologies, which were collected from healthy donors with institutional review board approval. All cell lines were tested mycoplasma negative using MycoAlert /C212Mycoplasma Detection Kit (Lonza). When indicated, cells were treated with drugs at 60-80% confluency at a nal DMSO concentration of 1%. At the end of treatment period, cells were placed on ice and washed once with PBS. Unless otherwise indicated, the cells were scraped with a spatula, pelleted by centrifugation (500 x g, 5 min) and lysed in RIPA buffer supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (cOmplete and phosSTOP, Roche) onice for 10 min. If lysates were to be used for immunoprecipitation, cells were lysed in Co-IP Lysis Buffer supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (cOmplete and phosSTOP, Roche) on ice for 30 min. Lysates were claried by high-speed centrifugation (19,000 x g, 10 min). Concentrations of lysates were determined with protein BCA assay (Thermo Fisher) and adjusted to 2 mg/mLwith additional RIPA buffer. Samples were mixed with 5x SDS Loading Dye and heated at 95 /C14C for 5 min. Generation of H358-KRAS(G12V) stable transfectant NCI-H358 cells (3 3106) plasmid 3000 (Invitrogen) following the Stable transfectants were selected with G418 (500 mg/mL). Selection was deemed complete when a mock-treated plate of cells had completely died (about 3 weeks). The selected cells were pooled and used in subsequent assays. The ectopic expression of the K-Ras(G12V) was conrmed by immunoblotting. Immunoprecipitation Antibodies were crosslinked to Protein G beads as follows. Protein G magnetic beads (New England Biolabs) were washed twice withCo-IP lysis buffer (100 mL/wash). 20 mg antibody was diluted in 100 mL Co-IP Lysis Buffer and added to the washed Protein G beads.

BiTE-mediated cell killing assay Target cell lines were engineered to constitutively express a nucleus-restricted red fluorescence Reagent). cells were seeded 96-well plates at 3,000 cells/well. (3 310 4/mL, 100mL/well). Cells were allowed to attach overnight (16 h). Meanwhile, PBMCs were thawed from frozen aliquots and allowed rest overnight (16 h) in RPMI +10% FBS. Solutions of ARS1620 at 2x the nal concentration were prepared in RPMI+10% FBS, and 100 mL of the 2x drug solutions were added to each well of the target cell plate. The mixture was incubated for 4 h, and then cells were gently washed three times with RPMI+10% FBS (200 mL/wash). In the last wash, only 100 mL of the wash solution was removed. PBMCs were diluted to 1.2 3106/mL. Antibody solutions were prepared at 4x the nal concentration (40 nM) in RPMI +10% of PBMCs (6 50 mL 4x antibody solution were added sequentially to each well. Cell growth was IncuCyte live cell imaging system (Essen Bioscience) every 2 h for a total of 72 h. At the end of the monitoring period, cells were transferred into a96-well U-shaped plate and pelleted by centrifugation (500 x g, 5 min). Cells were washed once with FACS Buffer and stained with a cocktail of the following antibodies at 23 /C14C FACS Buffer, resuspended in 150 mL FACS Buffer and analyzed on an Attune NxT flow cytometer. Animal studies Six-to seven-week-old female nude mice (NCr- Foxn1 nu) were purchased from Taconic Biosciences and housed with ad libitum food and water on a 12-h light cycle at the UCSF Preclinical Therapeutics Core vivarium. All animal studies were performed in full accor-dance with UCSF Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC protocol n. AN179937). H358 xenografts were established by subcutaneous injection into the right flanks of mice with H358 cells (5 310 6cells in 100 mLo f serum-free medium mixed 1:1 with Matrigel). Tumor size was assessed biweekly by 2D caliper measurement and volume was calcu- lated according to the volume of an ellipsoid ((width)2x length x 0.52). H538 tumor-bearing mice were randomized into control and treatment groups when tumors reached a size range of 100-120 mm3(n = 5 mice per group), and single or triple dosing of ARS1620 (200 mg/kg in Labrasol), single dosing (100 mg/kg in Labrasol), or vehicle control (Labrasol) was administered daily by oral gavage. After 24 h (for single treatment groups) or 72 h (for triple treatment group), tumors were harvested for subsequent analysis. Flow cytometry Cultured cells were dissociated by scraping in the presence of ice-cold PBS (with 5 mM EDTA) and passing through a 40- mm cell strainer. Dissected tumor tissues were dissociated into single cell suspensions using Collagenase IV and DNase I following a pub- lished protocol ( Leelatian et al., 2017 washed twice with FACS buffer (3% BSA in PBS, 5 mM EDTA) and stained with appropriate antibodies at four/C14C for 1 h.

Data were collected at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory Advanced Light Source beamline 8.3.1. Diffraction images were processed using Xia2 with the Dials pipeline ( Winter, 2010 ). Molecular replacement was per- formed using Phaser. The resulting structure models were rened over multiple rounds of restrained renement and isotropic B-factor minimization with Phenix( Adams et al., 2010 ). QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Quantitative data acquired by instruments was recorded as presented by the measuring device with the uncertainty equal to the smallest increment, unless specied by the manufacturer. Error propagation was performed when data was transformed. Indose-response experiments, concentration values were assumed to be accurate. IC 50values were determined by least-squares regression in GraphPad Prism 8.0, and 95% condence intervals, when available, were reported. Melting temperature values in dif- ferential scanning fluorimetry experiments were determined using the rst derivative method and reported as mean \u00b1 SD. Kineticconstants ( in interferometry experiments were determined by a proprietary regression algorithm (Forte Bio Octet Data Analysis 9.0), and their values and errors were reported as presented by the software. Statistical tests were performed using unpaired two-tailed Student's ttest with Holm-/C20S\u00b4da\u00b4k correction unpaired one-way ANOVA test with Dunnett's correction for multiple comparisons. T tests for cell killing assays were performedassuming two-tailed distribution because there is no denite reason for the treatment to decrease cell growth. The detailed method is specied in the gure legend of each experiment. Exact p values R0.0001 were provided in the gure or in the gure legend.
