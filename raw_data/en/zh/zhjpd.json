It is always an important conference, but its conclu-sions tend to be measured rather thanheadline grabbing.St Gallen 2005 appeared to be much inthe same vein. Yet on reflection, it is clearthat in its own quiet way it signalled thata revolution is underway and that breastcancer treatment will never be the sameagain.Weighing up the latest evidence, the con-ference concluded that every breast can-cer should be characterised according toeight elements: its size, histological type,grading, hormone receptor status, lymphnode status, proliferation index (Ki67),cErbB2 status and the presence orabsence of peritumour vascular invasion.Each of these eight parameters of breastcancer is independent of the others,which means breast cancer comes in 64(8x8) different variants.The implications of this are very far reach-ing. The whole concept of breast canceras a single disease is now dead, and wetherefore need to make fundamentalchanges in the way we approach treat-ment decisions. For a start, the tradition-Alberto Costa* GUEST EDITOR al TNM classification can no longer beconsidered an adequate guide to treat-ment, because it provides information ononly two of the eight parameters of signif-icance. The value of cytological examina-tion has also been brought into question,because all it can tell us is that we aredealing with a breast cancer.Many treatment dogmas will also need re-examining. For instance, is radiotherapyalways needed after conservative surgery?What if you have just operated on a 70-year-old patient, for a very-low-risktumour - 1 cm in size, no lymph nodeinvasion, 90% oestrogen-receptorpositive, 5% Ki67, It may take the patient twohours by bus to reach her nearest radio-therapy centre and another two hourshome again. Is six weeks of daily radio-therapy really worth the time, energy andcost in this case? Recognising how complex and variedbreast cancer is also vindicates the manyvoices who have been calling for breastcancer to be treated in specialist units byteams comprising a surgeon, an onco-plastic surgeon, specialised pathologist,radiotherapist, medical oncologist andbreast care nurse. Given what we nowknow, it would be utterly irresponsible tocontinue to treat any patient outside ofsuch a specialist setting.A quiet revolution *Fondazione Maugeri, Bellinzona, SwitzerlandCoverStory Peter Boyle: the man behind the statistics As a young epidemiologist, Peter Boyle once had to give a talk on trends in smoking-related cancer, having lost his father to the disease that same morning. Now head of the IARC,his great strength is an ability to inject a sense of the reality behind the statistics his staffwork on every day, and a sense of outrage at the inequalities they reveal. Peter Boyle can't quite believe he's heading one of the world's foremostcancer research organisations. As hesays, for a career epidemiologist andstatistician, there are few more pres- tigious posts than director of the World HealthOrganization's cancer body, the InternationalAgency for Research on Cancer (IARC). It's all a far cry from his formative years in one of Glasgow's infamous inner-city areas.However, Boyle's credentials fit the bill, fromearlier research work at the IARC itself in the1980s to a long spell at the European Instituteof Oncology in Milan, where he rose to interna-tional prominence with work that includedreassessments of the European Code againstCancer and developing a cancer atlas for theEuropean Union. What stands out is an empathy with the plight of millions facing cancer in the developingworld, and a determination to help improve theirlot. As he took control of the IARC last year, theWorld Health Assembly (the supreme body ofthe WHO) drew up its first ever resolution onMarc Beishon 4CANCER WORLD JULY-AUGUST 2005cancer prevention and control, which wasadopted this year. It has also introduced theFramework Convention on Tobacco Control.Both are in line with Boyle's aims for the IARCand with his long-standing interest in addressinghealth inequalities (as well as building on hisconsiderable track record in tobacco research). \"The issue today for cancer is the developing world,\" he says. \"When the IARC was formed 40years ago, cancer was a disease of WesternEurope, North America and Australia - now themajority of new cancer cases are occurring inlow- and medium-resource countries. Thesecountries are facing a triple whammy - chronicdisease is increasing, there is a high backgroundof communicable disease and they don't havethe resources to cope with the rising tide of thecancer burden.\" With the growing world population - 6.5 bil- lion now, rising to 9 billion by 2040 - the per-centage of older people will grow and cancerrates are set to explode. On his computer at theIARC's headquarters in Lyon, France, Boyle hasa programme that shows how the population isCoverStory CANCER WORLD JULY-AUGUST 2005 5\"All my career I've tried to grasp the clinical side rather than just the numbers\" GEORGES MOLLONCoverStory 6CANCER WORLD JULY-AUGUST 2005growing and ageing in China. As he brings up each year in the decades to come, the ageingeffect is quite dramatic. The figures have huge implications, yet pre- sented in this neat digital form, they look some-what spooky and divorced from reality. This aperception that Boyle is very keen to breakthrough. \"I still miss Milan because theEuropean Institute of Oncology was based in ahospital and there are always patients and theirfamilies milling about - the reality was there.When I came to the IARC I reminded the staffhere that cancer is affecting humans and notjust laboratory mice - a few said 'hooray' andsome said, 'Goodness what's this?'\" Since assuming the director's post - an elected position voted for by the IARC'sParticipating States - Boyle has worked quicklyto sort out several other more pragmatic issues.One was to address criticisms that the proce-dures to resolve conflicts of interest in its famedMonographs series, which evaluate the carcino-genic risks of various agents, were not transpar-ent enough. Another was to simplify andimprove the structure of the IARC - out hasgone some 25 team reports on the agency's workat director level; in has come five scientific 'clus-ters' linking, for example, epidemiology withbiology, and pathogenesis with prevention. The key role of the IARC, says Boyle, is to develop unique work programmes that cannot beconducted at national level. \"Our descriptive epidemiology, very influential in the developedcountries, is now having a huge impact in thedeveloping world, and the Monographs pro-gramme that evaluates carcinogenic hazards isessential and frequently the basis of environ-mental health legislation at country level.\" Otherhighlights are EPIC (European ProspectiveInvestigation into Cancer and Nutrition - a largemulti-centre cancer study), the TP53 mutationdatabase, and a major project on cervix cancerscreening in rural India. And a common threadnow, he adds, is \"integrating epidemiology with alaboratory component - mainly genetic\". With some 300 staff, IARC is a sizeable concern, and in Boyle it has a director with longexperience of applying such analysis to realworld problems from an early stage of his career. Boyle was one of the first students to read for a brand new statistics degree at the University ofGlasgow, and initially his ambition was to be aschoolteacher. It was by chance that a project heselected - a study on the risk factors for post-operative pain - got him involved with healthcareand he moved to Glasgow's Western Infirmary asa doctorate student. After various statisticalanalyses and consulting work he got the chanceto help organise the West of Scotland's cancerregistry and projects around it, such as clinicaltrials, with a particular focus on epidemiology. \"I was hooked - I liked the work very much, but all my career I've tried to understand whatthe clinical side of the problem is, rather thanjust looking at the numbers. It would have beena waste for me as a statistician to just sit in aroom and wait for someone to give me data toanalyse - although such pure academic researchis fine for some people. I've never been involvedin actual patient care but I have constantly beenexposed to clinicians and they accept you if youunderstand what they are talking about and canhelp them.\" He recalls a time in the cancer registry, labo- riously writing down age-specific cancer rates -0-4, 5-10, up to 85+ - on forms in the daysbefore desktop computers. \"There was a unifor-mity. You knew that say at age 50-54, if you had50 cases in one year you wouldn't get 3,000 thenext, as you might with an epidemic infectious With the prime minister of India,Manmohan Singh,earlier this year.IARC cancer CoverStory CANCER WORLD JULY-AUGUST 2005 7\"After an hour I realised that the cleaners knew more about epidemiology than I did\"disease. It meant we could investigate underly- ing mathematical structures and see what wasgoing to happen - and make the big jump, towhy it was happening.\" This drive was to propel him on a journey that would lead him to work among the elitenames of epidemiology - Richard Doll, Richardand Julian Peto, Brian MacMahon - names herecites with almost as much reverence as thoseof Glasgow Celtic's European Cup winningteam of 1967. Laying his hands on Scottish cancer mortal- ity data from 1911, he updated the registryinformation, demonstrating the huge and pre-dictable changes in tobacco-related cancer overtime. \"I submitted a paper to a big epidemiolog-ical association meeting in Edinburgh and goton the programme,\" he says. \"On the morning ofthe day I was due to speak, my father died fromlung cancer - he was a smoker most of his life -and in the afternoon I gave a talk on the trendsof smoking-related cancers in Scotland. Thatwas tough - but it was reality.\" Boyle was then to leave Scotland, so far for good, with his wife Helena and his first child. Ina roundabout way, via a training fellowship at theIARC, he found himself as an assistant profes-sor at the departments of biostatistics and epi-demiology at both the Harvard School of PublicHealth and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.\"After an hour I realised that the cleaners knewmore about epidemiology than I did - I didn'thave a clue about the fundamentals.\" And the biostatistics group, he says, \"had written the book about how you do clinical trials- and may well have been the best group of bio-statisticians ever assembled. It was the attentionto detail - data quality, model selection, exami-nation of interactions and ensuring the ran-domisation worked before coming up withanswers. Looking back it seems obvious, but itwasn't then.\" The challenge is not just to conduct rigor-ous randomised controlled trials, which for so long were considered the gold standard in med-icine. As Boyle points out, in public health workevidence may need to come from a variety ofboth 'hard' and 'soft' sources. \"One of the firstthings I did here was create a tobacco unit -there had never been one at the IARC - and wewant to now write a series of handbooks on thescientific evaluations of tobacco control recom-mendations. \"If we were looking at say a substance such as formaldehyde, which we do in ourMonographs, we have a choice of maybe a hun-dred peer-reviewed papers in the literature - buta lot of work on tobacco interventions that, say,try to stop children smoking are not published inthe same way - or not published at all. The levelof information you can use to make decisions isweaker and is more sociology and psychologythan hard-nosed science.\" Developing methods of sufficient scientific rigour that consider 'softer' evidence is certainlyneeded, particularly to identify interventionsthat target health inequalities. As Boyle men-tions, measures for getting people to quitsmoking have often been more successful withwell-off people with more motivation and betteraccess to resources - potentially widening thehealth gap (his home country of Scotland beinga prime example). The need to focus on the real issues was brought home to Boyle in the US by JohnCairns, \"a father figure of biology\". \"He said thatfrom time to time you have to look at issues, notjust uniquely focused scientific questions,\" saysBoyle. \"John got me to look at a paper in Science that said that since the introduction of the can-cer chemotherapy programme in the 1950s, itwas saving 150,000 deaths a year in the US. Ilooked at the data and put it together with whatwe knew about outcomes and found that thenumber of deaths saved a year was 15,000 -maximum. We did get a reply in Science - butCoverStory 8CANCER WORLD JULY-AUGUST 2005with major dramas such as BSE cow dis- ease'] and other food scares. He wasn't a publichealth man by training but could see what ahuge impact tobacco control could have inEurope and he put his career on the line.\" Tobacco is a big preoccupation for Boyle. He is lead author of the book Tobacco: science, policy and public health (OUP, 2004) - and he is naturally worried that this century will turnout to be even more grim \"There are currentlyabout 1.2 million cases of lung cancer aroundthe world - if nothing changes this will rise tothe same number in China alone by 2030. Wewill be swamped by smoking-related disease.\"He has high hopes for the WHO tobaccoframework, although time is clearly short evenfor a global organisation to make an impact. As he adds, public health professionals will only see results through the often brave action ofpoliticians, such as David Byrne and others onthe tobacco front in places like Ireland, Italy andNew York. Boyle's engagement with movers andshakers at European - and now world - levelhave certainly given him insight into the art ofthe possible and the politics of running organi-sations. That insight was quickly tested at the IARC, when EU funding streams for several cancerprojects such as EPIC were cut off, and he's hadto provide bridging monies while alternativesources were sought. He also inherited an attack on the integrity of the IARC over possible conflicts of intereston regrading the status of certain carcinogens.\"We couldn't put our finger on an instancewhere a meeting was deliberately hijacked byundeclared vested interests,\" says Boyle.\"Classifications can go up and down as moreevidence becomes available.\" To silence the crit-ics, however, the IARC has now created a newcategory of 'invited specialists,' where any withconflicts are not allowed to write drafts, vote or \"One of the first things I did was create a tobacco unit - there had never been one at the IARC\"they left off the tag that 10,000 medical oncolo- gists were preventing only 1.5 deaths each ayear.\" Boyle managed to escape intact from the US after this, and faced with a choice betweenworking in Glasgow or the IARC at Lyon, chosethe latter. He directed a programme calledSearch - Surveillance of Environmental FactorsRelated to Cancer in Humans - a series of case-control studies across several centres on sub-jects such as children's brain tumours. Then in 1991 he was invited to head up the department of epidemiology and biostatistics atthe European Institute of Oncology in Milan -in fact he was the first employee at the thenfledgling outfit, one of the many brainchilds offamous cancer surgeon Umberto Veronesi. Boyle mentions several highlights of his long tenure at the institute. One was being able tocontinue research interests such as the linkbetween pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer -with various collaborations he helped the workthrough all the way to identifying a gene from aninitial case control study. \"Veronesi was also very generous in allowing staff to be involved in bigger projects - and I gota lot of exposure in the European CancerExperts Group.\" One of Boyle's inputs to thisgroup - which is a European Union meeting ofexperts - was a document informing a consen-sus meeting on tobacco. Approved by the thenEuropean health commissioner, Padraig Flynn,and after a good deal of reworking, it led to theEuropean tobacco directive on the content ofcigarettes. \"I was invited to the EuropeanParliament for the final approval vote - that waspublic health in action,\" says Boyle. He pays particular tribute to subsequent health commissioner David Byrne, who sawboth the EU tobacco content and advertisingdirectives through. \"I was very close to David -he was magnificent despite having to contendCoverStory CANCER WORLD JULY-AUGUST 2005 9chair working groups, and all names are pub- lished on its website. Inevitably he is well plugged into the politics of the European cancer community - a particu-lar concern is that there are rather too manyobstacles at present to achieve the kind of unitythat would maximise European resources.\"Things are still too national - there are hugebarriers to mobility within Europe,\" he says. \"It'snot so much at the administrative level, but cul-tural - it's very difficult to recruit a 45- to 50-year-old professional who may be at his or hermost productive, when they are tied down withchildren's education and other factors. It meansthat, for example, if the head of the NationalCancer Institute in the US wants to set up anational proteomics centre he'll get the cream of280 million people to work in it - in Europe with500 million people, the UK, Germany, Franceand so on will all set up their own.\" Further thoughts will no doubt arise from a major grant from the European Commissionthat Boyle has been awarded - for a feasibilitystudy on co-ordination of national cancerresearch activities. On the vexed question of a European wide cancer society, Boyle feels that FECS (theFederation of European Cancer Societies) was agreat idea at the time - but it now suffers frombeing an organisation whose members are othermembership bodies. If it can evolve into a soci-ety with more individual representation it wouldprobably assume a higher international profile,he feels. And while recognising that the recent European breast cancer resolution has raisedthe profile of this disease, he is concerned thatthe fight against cancer should not be fragment-ed too much - \"We have to find ways of unifyinginterest groups,\" he comments. Integration across a broad range of cancer research issues is certainly Boyle's aim with theIARC's cluster structure. \"One of the greatadvantages we have is that we have all groupshere - genetics, epidemiology, biostatistics andso on - which you don't have in most other insti-tutes.\" As an example he cites the genetics andepidemiology cluster, which has researcherswith a spectrum of strengths in the two disci-plines, plus laboratory expertise. \"That cluster works together very closely - we collect the dataand the correct biological material in well-designed epidemiological studies, and it isanalysed in the lab in a state of the art way to beinterpretable in terms of what's happening in thepopulation.\" Boyle's focus is now of course on the world cancer stage, which is guiding where this expert-ise is targeted. \"If we want to make an impact wehave to focus more on the low- and medium-resource countries - while not neglecting thedeveloped countries, where we can still help. \"For example, there is an epidemic of oral cancer in Central and Eastern Europe - themortality rate has gone up 10 fold in Hungary inthe last 30 years. We have got to compare riskfactors there with Western Europe, where themortality rate has not gone up, and we're notonly interested in alcohol and tobacco as riskfactors - is there a genetic cause too? These arethe sort of big studies we organise.\" But it's clear too, he adds, \"that in the poor- er countries effective prevention is going to bemuch cheaper than treatment and we need todevelop appropriate strategies.\" As such,screening work is assuming a higher profile.\"For example, we now have results from tenyears' follow-up of a screening study of oral can-cer in Kerala, India, which shows mortalityreduced by one-third among those at high risk.We also have a randomised trial of 120,000 Boyle's 300 staff, at the 10 CANCER WORLD JULY-AUGUST 2005women in rural India for cervix cancer. It's a huge and extremely important study and wehave finished the first round of screening - andagain, while no results are yet available we areextremely pleased that we managed to treat over80% of women who we thought were positive.That's so different from what goes on in poorrural settings at present.\" The cervix screening work is backed by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, whichBoyle says is one of the major funding sourcesfor projects of this nature. He adds that suchwork also needs to take account of local condi-tions - \"We in the West may have been guilty ofidentifying what we perceive as the prioritiesand applying a Western solution. That may notbe the way to go.\" In the cervix cancer programme in India, for example, a 'low-tech' visual inspection is alsocarried out to 'see and treat' immediately - asmany women would simply have been lost tofurther clinic follow-up. As part of a consortiumof public health agencies, the IARC has alsolaunched a toolkit for implementing cervix can-cer screening, while Boyle, on a recent trip toIndia, was invited to meet prime ministerManmohan Singh - \"He is aware of health andpoverty issues.\" While the low- and medium-resource coun- tries have pressing priorities, Boyle is also struckby just how much disparity is present in thedeveloped world. In the IARC's cancer mortali-ty atlas of Europe, which covers the expandedEuropean Union, some of the worst figures forlung cancer do come from the poorer memberstates. \"But the highest rate of all is in Glasgow, where 70-80% of the population are in depriva-tion categories six and seven.\" He mentions a study on breast cancer out- comes in Scotland that found a big gap in sur-vival rates between well-off and poor peopleafter adjusting for prognostic and treatment fac-tors. \"We have to find out what's driving that -there's something inherently unfair in a poorperson having a poorer survival outlook com-pared to a more well-off person with identicaldisease. It's the sort of inequality that leaves youreally cold.\" He's also acutely aware that in someadvanced countries - the US, for example -women from some sections of the communityare also still presenting with advanced disease. As he adds, it's only been in recent years that these differences have been visible throughpopulation indexing techniques. It all adds tothe complex jigsaw that makes up the risk fac-tors and risk determinants for cancer, and Boylefeels that deprivation is a critical factor that isnot receiving enough attention. Boyle's broad understanding of the cancer research spectrum has put him well up journal-ists' contact lists for comment on topics such asrisk factors, screening and treatment that tendto flood the media. As he notes, there are somehundreds of risk factors for breast cancer alone,and there are many institutes sending out pressreleases - a recent one from the IARC itselfconcerns a study showing that vegetables andfruit are not protective against breast cancer.And a current IARC study on mobile phone useis bound to generate great interest. Getting results can depend on brave action by politicians such as David Byrne on the tobacco front \"It's unfair that a poor person has a worse prognosis than a better off person with identical disease\"CoverStory CANCER WORLD JULY-AUGUST 2005 11While he professes exasperation at some of the more absurd media reports, he points out thatsometimes the cancer community has itself toblame. \"A particular bee in my bonnet is atmeetings where papers are press released to getmedia attention, but often have many holes intheir findings, being suitable only for a poster orshort presentation. \"A while back at the ASCO [American Society for Clinical Oncology] annual confer-ence plenary session there was a paper thatclaimed that PSA testing reduced the mortalityrate of prostate cancer - it got huge publicity. I'dseen the paper a month before - and I said atthe meeting that using an 'intent to treat' analy-sis showed there was absolutely no evidence ofa protective effect.\" This publicity machine \"iswrong and a disservice\" to the cancer communi-ty, adds Boyle. On a personal note, Boyle has certainly proved that it is possible to develop a careeraway from his roots. His three daughters wereeducated in Lyon and Milan and are all nowpursuing medical careers - the \"stream ofstrange foreign medical people arriving for din-ner\" over the years being a clear risk factor intheir choice, as he puts it. However, his wifeHelena did have to give up her career as a mathsteacher to look after the family and help thechildren with their studies. His great passion is football - he used to play himself and has always been a fanatical Celticsupporter. But Scotland in general is a great ref-erence point. In talks he's spoken of the 'good,bad and ugly' of cancer work in the country, fromoutstanding progress with a national cancer plandown to the continuing impact of deprivation.He's quoted Voltaire saying, \"We look toScotland for all our ideas about civilisation\" - asits model of cancer control is eminentlyexportable (and there also seems to be quite a lotof Scots making waves in world cancer work). Athome in Lyon, he always logs on to the Internetto see the latest news from Scotland. Looking ahead to achievements for the ini- tial five years of his post at the IARC - and asecond term could be on the cards - Boyle sayshe was first encouraged to set targets, which hehas resisted. \"In 1985 when Europe AgainstCancer was set up, the cancer experts met for the first meeting in Milan and, against a hugerise in cancer rates, they set a target to reducethe number of deaths in Europe by 15% by theyear 2000. I saw this published at the time andcolleagues and I laughed. \"But through a series of actions on screen- ing, primary prevention and tobacco controlthere was a 9% reduction in the number of can-cer deaths expected.\" Boyle was in fact leadevaluator for the target by this point. To achievemore than half of that ambitious target wastremendous, he says, and there is plenty of meritin having such goals even if they are not met(and since then the EU has set a new target of a20% decline in cancer mortality for 2015). For someone so well versed in number crunching, though, his preference is for a morequalitative approach for the IARC. \"If I canincrease the quality and relevance of theresearch we do here, increase prospects for can-cer prevention and help improve the situation inthe poorer societies, I'll be quite happy.\" With David Byrne, then EuropeanCommissionerfor WORLD Scientists have discovered an epithelial growth factorreceptor (EGFR) mutation that could explain why good response.Two teams seem to have raced eachother to press with the publication oftwo papers coming just two daysapart.The research could be important forthe development of second-generation EGFR inhibitors andcould help refine the ofRoche/OSI/Genentech's Tarceva(erlotinib) and AstraZeneca's Iressa(gefitinib), although the latter isfacing an uncertain future after itfailed to show a survival benefit inthe phase III ISEL (Iressa SurvivalEvaluation in Lung Cancer) study.A group of researchers from theMemorial Sloan-Kettering CancerCenter had their work publishedonline on February 22nd in PLoS Medicine 1, ahead of its print version in March.The other team, which was led byBalazs Halmos from the UniversityHospitals of Cleveland, published itsresearch as a brief report in the New England Journal of Medicine(February 24th, p786). The resultsadd to findings last year that patientswho responded to Iressa therapy had mutations in EGFRthat sensitised patientsresistant either Iressaor and con-firmed the finding in anNSCLC cell line.

The MemorialSloan-Kettering researchers foundthat a further three resistant patientsdid not have the T790M mutation.They also note that T790M isdistinct from the KRAS gene, whichis known to cause primary resistanceto the products, and EGFR over-expression could also be a source ofresistance. The authors of the NEJMpaper suggest that the developmentof a new EGFR mutation shows thatthe tumour cells remain dependenton EGFR for their proliferation. SECOND GENERATION Understanding exactly how T790Mstops cells responding to Iressa orTarceva could help design second-generation inhibitors. It seems, fromcrystal structure analyses, whichboth teams carried out, that an aminoacid substitution caused by T790Mcreates a steric clash so the productscannot bind to EGFR, but themutation does not stop the receptorfrom functioning. Therefore,products that bind to EGFR in adifferent way would be less affectedby T790M.After looking at structural data on thecompound, the speculates thatGlaxoSmithKline's dual lapatinib, couldhave a role in resistant patients,although they note it has not yet beentested in this population.

This attitude, though still widespread, is now being challenged by manypatients and doctors, who argue that it is inexcusable to prescribe treatments that couldrender a patient infertile, without a thorough discussion of all the options. ABelgian woman made medical history in September 2004 when shebecame the first mother to conceiveand give birth to a baby after an ovar-ian transplant following her success- ful treatment for cancer. For Ouarda Touirat, 32, the arrival of her daughter, Tamara, was a dream come true. Theachievements of her team of doctors, led byJacques Donnez at the Catholic University ofLouvain in Brussels, gave hope to hundreds ofother women who were facing similar prospectsof possible infertility after cancer treatment. Touirat had been diagnosed with stage IV Hodgkin's lymphoma in 1997 at the age of 25.Before she underwent chemotherapy and radio-therapy, Donnez and his team extracted strips ofovarian tissue from her left ovary and frozethem. The cancer treatment cured herHodgkin's lymphoma, but left her infertile. In 2003 the frozen ovarian tissue was thawed and reimplanted just below her rightovary. Five months later her menstrual cycle wasrestored and in January 2004 she became preg-Emma Mason nant naturally, without assisted reproductiontechnology. In (vol pp 1405-1410), Donnez wrote: \"Our findings open new perspec-tives young cancer patients facing prematureovarian failure. Ovarian tissue cryopreservationshould be an option offered to all young womendiagnosed with cancer, in conjunction with otherexisting options for fertility preservation, such [freezing].\" However, the medical world reacted more cautiously. Two letters in a subsequent issue ofThe Lancet (vol 364, pp 2091-2092 and 2093- 2094) pointed out that it was not yet safe for thisexperimental procedure to become standardpractice. Not only did the treatment have a verylow chance of success, but also it was arduousand invasive, there was a risk of the original can-cer re-seeding itself from the transplanted ovar-ian tissue, and important ethical and legal issuesneeded to be addressed. The case of Touirat is a good example ofPatient Voice CANCER WORLD JULY-AUGUST 2005 47some of the technical and ethical problems that confront oncologists and fertility experts whentreating patients of reproductive age with a diag-nosis of cancer. Many oncologists and patients would agree on one thing, however: it is vital that cancerpatients should be given an opportunity to dis-cuss issues and explore options related to theirfertility before any treatment is begun that couldrender them infertile. THE DOCTOR 'S DUTY Sophie Foss\u00e5, a urologist who specialises in tes-ticular cancer at the Norske Radium Hospital inOslo, Norway, sees patients of all ages andbelieves that it is her duty to raise the issue ofher patients' future fertility with them. \"It's very important that as a doctor you con-sider fertility and fertility-saving treatment options as much as possible. It is important bothfor the doctor to consider it and for the patientto know that you are considering it,\" she said.\"Doctors have to take a proactive role, especial-ly with the young ones who will never talk to youspontaneously about it. Often, boys and youngmen will say they don't want to think about fer-tility, they don't want to take more time out oftheir lives to go to clinics to give semen samples,they just want to be cured, and then you have topush them to think about it.\" Discussing fertility serves another purpose too, believes Foss\u00e5. \"With a young boy it is giv-ing a very important, indirect message that youbelieve that they will be cured and life will con-tinue. Many patients don't believe that they willsurvive, but if you do these things to preservetheir fertility you are telling them life will go on.It's very important psychologically for youngmen to freeze semen.\" Antonella Surbone, Head of the Teaching Division at the European School of Oncology inMilan, Italy, and a breast cancer specialist, saidthat fertility issues are a major concern for youngpatients. In a 1996 study, patients treated forHodgkin's lymphoma ranked fertility amongsttheir top three concerns, along with whether ornot they were going to be cured and whether ornot the cancer might recur. As such, it is one of Baby Tamara, pictured here with her parents Ouarda Touirat and Malik Bouanati, was conceived naturally after hermother received pioneering fertility preserving treatment.The procedure, which involves removing ovarian tissue andreimplanting it following cancer treatment, offers hope tomany young women, but it is still highly experimental andmany safety concerns remainYVES LOGGHE / AP PHOTOPatient Voice 48 CANCER WORLD JULY-AUGUST 2005Vickie Maye diagnosed age 25 On September 11, 2001, as people worldwide watched in horror as two passenger jets smashed into the WorldTrade Center in New York, Vickie Maye was staring atan X-ray of her chest. \"Right in the centre, extending across my ribs, there was a grey blur, almost like a cloud. Just a coupleof hours earlier, a doctor had told me it was 'abnormal'.Two weeks, two biopsies and many sleepless nightslater, I was told I had cancer. I was 25 years old.\" Vickie is from Ireland but was working as a jour- nalist in Australia at the time, and while her boyfriend,also a journalist, was working flat out on the biggeststory in decades, she was having to grapple with a diag-nosis of Hodgkin's lymphoma. \"The diagnosis blew me away. It came as a com- plete shock.\" The cancer had only been discovered because the Department of Immigration required a medical exami-nation, including a chest X-ray to rule out tuberculosis,before it considered her application for residency in thecountry. Vickie was treated with chemotherapy (ABVD) and radiotherapy, but right from the start she wanted toknow about the effect the cancer and its treatmentwould have on her fertility. \"Fertility was a big issue for me. It was one of the first questions I asked, after was I going to die and wasI going to lose my hair. The thought of having no kidshaunted me. My haematologist told me that the treat-ment he was giving me, ABVD, was going to give me abetter chance of not being permanently infertile. Iknew the chances were good but they couldn't give meguarantees. \"My haematologist was amazing, but his main con- cern was to get rid of the tumour. While he gave me treat-ment that had been shown to have less impact on fertili- ty, he simply wasn't clued in on the ins and outs of it all. Incorrectly tested \"Soon after treatment, I asked my haematologist if Icould have my fertility tested. He agreed and arrangedthe necessary blood tests. When we got the results, twoof the three levels showed I was post-menopausal. Iwas beside myself. He told me to relax, that he wouldrepeat the tests again in a few months. I simplycouldn't wait another three months. The stress was toomuch. So I took it upon myself to see a fertility expert.He told me that to test fertility, bloods need to be takenon day one or two of a woman's period. The sampleswere taken at the right time and my fertility was foundto be normal. The soaring levels previously recordedwere simply a result of incorrect timing. \"This was the only issue I had with my treatment: the apparent lack of communication that existedbetween fertility experts and cancer specialists. WhileI appreciate that my doctor's focus was to cure me ofcancer, fertility was naturally a concern to me in my20s and should have been addressed appropriately.\" Soon after her treatment finished, Vickie returned to Ireland where she now works on the Irish Independent . Aged 29, she is in remission, her ovarian function has returned to normal and in July she is dueto give birth to a daughter, Mia, conceived naturallywithout assisted reproduction technology. \"I waited two years, as recommended by the doc- tors, before becoming pregnant. While I had had fertil-ity tests done, I still had this awful feeling that I wouldbe unable to simply fall pregnant. I imagined I wouldhave to face IVF [in-vitro fertilisation]. It used to hauntme. So she is a little miracle!\" Fertility was a big issue ... the thought of having no kids haunted mePatient Voice CANCER WORLD JULY-AUGUST 2005 49the primary issues that oncologists should dis- cuss with their patients, not necessarily in theirvery first consultation, but very soon afterwards. \"Oncologists need to know about treatment choices, both in terms of efficacy in dealing withthe cancer, and in terms of the degree of toxici-ty and the effect it might have on the patient'sfertility. You have to make a treatment choice,offer a treatment choice, and evaluate whetheryou are going to give a treatment that has xrisk of causing infertility versus one that has half thatrisk. It's inexcusable for an oncologist to pre-scribe without knowing about the spectrum oftoxicity, especially fertility, knowing this is one ofpatients' top concerns,\" she said. Surbone says that both oncologists and their patients need to know three things. \"Fertility canbe impaired due to factors unconnected with can-cer, such as hormonal disturbances, sperm quality,smoking and alcohol; this is still a hypothesis, butfertility may be impaired by the cancer itself; and,fertility can be impaired by the cancer treatment. \"These need to be explained to the patient, although, as an oncologist, I can only look at thethird aspect when discussing treatment optionswith my patients.\" Unfortunately, not all oncologists are willing or able to discuss fertility with their patients, andnor do they always communicate with or referpatients to fertility clinics, as Jan's story (below)and the other case studies (pp. 48, 51, 52) show.Jan, from southern Germany, was diagnosed withchronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) three yearsago when he was 28. He still feels angry about theway the subject of his future fertility was handled. \"The diagnosing doctor didn't really tell me about impacts on fertility and about freezingsemen before starting a therapy - he would haveput me on chemotherapy right away. Luckily, Iwanted to know all my options before taking anydrugs, so I drove all around Germany to receivesecond opinions from several doctors. One inter-nationally renowned specialist in CML research, who is still my trusted doctor today, calmed medown and said that for CML there was no reasonto hurry into any treatment. I should make up mymind first about my preferred therapy, banksperm and then start a treatment in a few weeks.\" TIME TO CONSIDER This is what Jan did and he is glad that he tookthe time to find out. \"After receiving a diagnosisof CML, nothing was more far away thanthoughts of family planning. But look at my sit-uation today: the treatment works successfully,the illness is currently under control and normallife has returned. I am 31, happily married, in anormal job, and hoping for a long life. It wouldbe devastating not to have had the chance totake precautions to preserve my fertility. This issomething young patients have to be madeaware of before starting any cancer treatment.\" But Jan raises two fears that are worries for patients and their doctors: will the cancer orgenetic mutations arising as a result of it or itstreatment adversely affect any offspring, and willhis own cancer recur while he is trying to start afamily with his wife? Jan's CML is held in check Glivec (ima- tinib), a newly-developed drug, which is stillbeing tested in clinical trials. \"Even thoughGlivec has been in use for four years, there is lit-tle official data on fertility. I am in touch withmore than a dozen patients who have fatheredchildren during Glivec therapy, ignoring anywarnings, and all babies seem to be very healthy.But who knows in the long term, and who col-lects the data? \"Additionally, stopping the drug before fathering would be one option, but who knowsthat conception would be immediate? Stoppingtherapy would give my illness an opportunity toproliferate; so this is risky as well. We also don'tknow whether in-vitro fertilisation will induce \"It's like trying to back a horse without knowing how many horses are running or in which race\"Patient Voice 50 CANCER WORLD JULY-AUGUST 2005additional risks and strains - for my wife as well as for the baby. We already made one attempt thatfailed, so we know this way is not the easiest. \"Therefore, we'll have to decide between the risk of conceiving whilst on the drug, the risk ofstopping the drug, or the risk of in-vitro fertilisa-tion. All their life, young cancer patients likemyself have to decide on uncertainty.\" Jan has put his finger on the crux of the problem that confronts cancer patients: it is rarefor there to be a treatment option that is clearlythe best path to take. Patients and their doctorsconstantly have to weigh up uncertainties, tryingto choose the treatment that is most efficaciouswhile also fitting in with the patients' aspirationsfor the future. NO SURE BETS Sarah Gahan, 42, a breast cancer patient who isnow in remission (see p. 52), said: \"There arelots of choices, but no obvious right way or tidydecision that can be made, and sometimes thedoctors and scientists are as much in the dark asyou are. \"My tumour was oestrogen positive, and with this type of tumour the question is whethertrying to become pregnant and pregnancy itselfmight make the tumour grow more. And theanswer is that nobody knows. It's like trying toback a horse in a race when you don't know how many horses are running or in which race.\" Thisis where good communications and relationsbetween doctors and their patients are vital, sothat patients feel that they are able to make fullyinformed choices about their treatments, withsupport and advice from a doctor they trust. Both Foss\u00e5 and Surbone point out that oncologists need to consider fertility issueswhen their patients have any cancer where thetreatment involves chemotherapy or radiothera-py, both of which can damage fertility eithertemporarily or permanently, and not only whenthe cancer is related to the reproductive organs(as with testicular, ovarian, endometrial orbreast cancer). In many ways, the options open to boys and men when confronted with a diagnosis of cancerare easier than for girls and women. Men canhave their sperm frozen and the sperm do notsuffer too much during the freeze-thaw process.The sperm can then be used at a later date tofertilise a partner's eggs by in-vitro fertilisation,sometimes using intra-cytoplasmic sperm injec-tion (ICSI) to make sure the sperm reaches theegg successfully. Even for younger boys who are not yet able to ejaculate sperm, there is a possible solution.Foss\u00e5 said: \"Sperm can be extracted under Dan Savage (see also box opposite) created 13 paintings focusing on his experience of cancer, including its potentialimpact on his fertility. The images were displayed last Mayat the conference of the Teenage Cancer Trust, for whichhe acts as an ambassador in the UKPatient Voice CANCER WORLD JULY-AUGUST 2005 51anaesthetic, although the success of this is not clear yet, and it's very important for these youngboys that you don't over-treat.\" TECHNICAL CHALLENGES For girls and women, the options are more com-plicated. The female ovary contains its fullcomplement of eggs at birth. However, tech-niques for freezing eggs have not been very suc-cessful so far, with the egg suffering severedamage during the freeze-thawing process.Therefore, a woman has to have a partner whocan provide sperm so that any eggs retrievedcan be fertilised immediately, allowed to startdeveloping into an embryo in vitro and thenfrozen until it can be implanted in the womanwhen the cancer treatment has finished and sheis ready to start a family. For girls or womenwithout partners, this is not an option open to them, nor is it available in many countries. However, it is possible to freeze and thaw suc- cessfully whole ovaries or strips of ovarian tissue.Eggs can be retrieved from the thawed tissue,matured in vitro, then fertilised and any resultingembryos implanted. Or, as the case of Touiratshows, the ovarian tissue can be transplanted backinto the woman, although this is at too experi-mental a stage to be considered a standard option. Where radiotherapy is part of the treatment, it is sometimes possible to remove the ovariesfrom the radiation field. Some drugs used inchemotherapy have a less severe effect on fertil-ity, both for men and for women, than others,and it is quite possible for fertility to be restoredonce the treatment has finished. A commontheme amongst the cancer patients featured hereDan Savage diagnosed age 20 Dan, 22, was studying art at Lancaster University when he discovered a lump the size of half a pea in his righttesticle two years ago. \"I was actually checking my testicles because a teacher of mine at school had had testicular cancer andhe told us all to check our testicles regularly, so I did.The doctor thought it was a cyst, but I pressed a bitharder and he referred me to the hospital. Ultrasoundshowed it was stage I testicular cancer. I was luckybecause I caught it early. I had the operation atLancaster and then was transferred to St James's inLeeds for chemotherapy. \"The chemo was largely precautionary. The out- ward appearance of the tumour suggested it was early,but when they dissected it, they found it was quitedeveloped, just on the brink of spreading and theydidn't want to take that risk. \"The doctors talked about fertility before they gave me chemo. It came as quite a shock, and I hadn't con-sidered it. It was very sudden from that point on, as Ihad to go to the fertility clinic twice to provide sperm samples, once three days before I started chemo andonce on the very day I started my chemo. \"I think that you should know about fertility issues beforehand, especially as at my sort of age and a bitolder you start to think about starting a family, and it'simportant. I think I'd probably wait a few more yearsbefore starting a family, but I would like to have chil-dren while I'm still in my 20s.\" Dan is now in remission, but goes for regular checks. He was keen to highlight one particular aspectof his experience. \"Two months before my cancer wasdiagnosed I had a swelling of my breast tissue. Whenyou are about 14 or 15 you have that feeling and it is todo with the maturing process, so I thought it was thehormones, but actually it was the testicular cancer. Noone has ever mentioned this as a symptom, and it'squite important that people know about it. Had Iknown, I might not have needed chemo, as the testic-ular cancer would have been caught months earlier.\" It came as quite a shock when the doctors mentioned fertilityPatient Voice 52 CANCER WORLD JULY-AUGUST 2005is that not only would they have liked to have the options for fertility discussed openly with themup front, but also that they needed more time toassimilate the information and make decisions.Gahan said: \"The decision-making process atthe beginning was too hurried, and it was themedical profession that was pushing it forward.I needed more time to come to terms with thediagnosis, more time to consider choices andmore time to consider fertility issues.\" Estimates suggest that one in a thousand peo-ple is a cancer survivor, due to increased preva- lence of the disease and improved treatments.Surbone and Foss\u00e5 believe this makes it imperativefor physicians to take the time to discuss all avail-able options with their patients and to consider fer-tility preservation as an integral part of patient care. Vickie Maye, 29, who is in remission from Hodgkin's lymphoma and pregnant with her firstchild (see p. 48), sums it up: \"Cancer is not adeath sentence. You can live a full life, so whyshould you not be able to have a family?\"Sarah Gahan diagnosed age 36 Sarah Gahan, 42, and her husband had been trying to start a family for 18 months without success when shediscovered she had breast cancer at the age of 36. \"I found a lump in my right breast, which didn't worry me at all because I'm used to having bumps onme from lipomas [small benign, slow-growing tumoursthat come from fat cells and which are not cancer]. Ihad it checked out and it was a bit of a bomb shell tofind it was cancer.\" Just over two weeks after her cancer diagnosis, Sarah had a lumpectomy and her lymph nodesremoved (to see whether the cancer had started tospread), followed by chemotherapy. Initially, her doc-tors did not mention fertility to her, and it was onlyafter she researched breast cancer on the Internet andbrought the subject up herself that it was discussed. \"The unspoken attitude is still very much 'Why are you worrying about your fertility when we are trying tosave your life?'. It was just not considered an issue. Ifound it a bit patronising,\" said Sarah, who lives inLondon. \"I hit lucky with the consultant oncologist that I saw. He is heavily into research and he understood aboutyoung women and fertility. He tried to get me onto a trialto have epirubicin, but he also made a call to an ART[assisted reproduction technology] facility, where a woman saw me the same day in her lunch hour.\" Frozen embryos As a result, Sarah was able to have eggs retrieved fromher ovaries in her next cycle and she startedchemotherapy immediately afterwards. The eggs werefertilised with her husband's sperm via ICSI (intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection), creating seven embryos,which were frozen. In remission and approaching 40,Sarah and her husband John decided to try to start afamily. The best three of the frozen embryos wereimplanted together, but unfortunately Sarah failed tobecome pregnant. At present she is not planning to usethe remaining embryos, but psychologically it helps herto know that they are there if she changes her mind. \"I think I may be ovulating naturally now, and if I become pregnant naturally that would be wonderful.\" She pointed out that young women of her age rep- resent a very small proportion of breast cancer patients,but for them, fertility is likely to be a big issue. \"I need-ed more information, up front, and breathing space.Unless a woman's cancer is going to kill her in the nexttwo weeks, then give them time to think about it.There are lots of difficult issues to come to terms with.\" The unspoken attitude is still 'Why worry about fertility when we are trying to save your life?'Impact Factor 40 CANCER WORLD JULY-AUGUST 2005Anew study has shown that the sentinel node biopsy can be ahighly reliable way of checking whether breast cancer has metasta-sised to lymph nodes. The procedureavoids routine removal of axillarylymph nodes in breast cancer patientsby looking only at the first node thatlymph from the cancerous tissuedrains to - the 'sentinel node'.The study, which was published inJanuary in the European Journal of Cancer (vol 41, pp231-237), followed 953 women operated for breast can-cer who did not undergo dissection ofthe axillary lymph nodes, after a biop-sy revealed no metastases in the sen-tinel node. Patients were initiallyexamined at four-monthly intervalsfor three years and then at six-month-ly intervals, with axilla palpation andultrasound when deemed necessary.The results after a median follow-upof 38 months, showed a much lowerrate of overt ipsilateral axillary metas-tasis than had been anticipated.An earlier validation study published inthe Journal of the National Cancer Institute in 1999 (vol 91, pp368-373), had found metastases in the dissectedlymph nodes of 6% of women withnegative sentinel node biopsy results.Based on these results, and assumingall positive nodes become clinically evi- dent at a constant rate over 15 years,the investigators in the current studywere expecting around 13 patients todevelop ipsilateral metastases.The results showed only three casesof overt ipsilateral axillary metastasis(0.3%) - much lower than the expect-ed 13. In all three cases, the womenreceived total axillary dissection andare presently alive and well. In addi-tion, results show the five-year overallsurvival rate of the whole series was98% and that 55 unfavourable eventsoccurred, 37 of which related to theprimary breast carcinoma.\"These patients are surviving well -their curability is very high and theyhave an excellent quality of life,\" saysUmberto Veronesi, from theEuropean Institute of Oncology,Milan, Italy, who was a pioneer of thetechnique and was the principalinvestigator of the study. He adds thatlocal morbidity following the sentinelnode biopsy was low, with three casesof local haematoma, five cases ofseroma, seven of local infection andsix of limited anaesthesia of the arm.It is also noteworthy that only 20women developed distant metastases- the trial team believe such low ratesmay be attributable to the beneficialeffects of maintaining healthy immunological tissue.The authors of the study believe theirresearch confirms the safety of sentinelnode biopsy and makes a strong casefor its universal introduction. \"After theresults of this study I think all centresin the world should be undertakingsentinel node biopsy,\" says Veronesi.This was the largest series yet follow-ing women with negative sentinelnodes, and it adds weight to earlierresearch by the same group, pub-lished two years ago in the New England Journal of Medicine (vol 349, pp546-553). That study showed thenumber of sentinel nodes identifiedwith malignancies was the same forwomen who had undergone sentinelnode biopsy followed by automaticaxillary dissection as for those whoonly underwent axillary dissection ifthe sentinel node contained metas-tases. In group randomised toreceive automatic axillary dissectionregardless of result, investigatorsfound the overall accuracy of sentinelnode biopsy compared to pathology ofthe other nodes was 96.9%. ADVANTAGES Veronesi's 2003 study had shown con-siderable advantages for sentinel nodeJanet FrickerSentinel node biopsy gets an excellent report The latest study on use of the sentinel node biopsy has prompted calls for the procedure to be universally adopted. But can inexperienced teams be trusted to get it right?CANCER WORLD JULY-AUGUST 2005 41Impact Factor biopsy, with the women undergoing sentinel node biopsy experiencingless pain and better arm mobility thanthose who also underwent surgery.\"Such low rates of false-negatives arewidely accepted, since the advantageof avoiding axillary side effects isthought to outweigh any negativeaspects,\" says Veronesi. He adds thatremoving normal lymph nodes inpatients with cancer is now viewed asa biological mistake since it reducestheir defence mechanisms.Sentinel node biopsy is a simple pro-cedure involving 5-10 technetium-99-labelled humancolloid particles in the sub dermisabove the tumour or in the tissueimmediately surrounding it. The sen-tinel node can be visualised 30minutes to three hours later, withmammary and axillary planar scinti-graphic scans, as it has the highestconcentration of radioactive material.Possible explanations for the lowerthan expected say the investigators,include post-operative radiotherapy tothe breast reaching the lymph nodes, and adjuvant treatment (mainlytamoxifen) delaying the clinicalappearance of metastasis. But themost likely explanation, they suggest,is that a number of occult metastaseswill never become clinically evident,and will remain silent in a dormantstate or may even disappear.\"Such thinking is in line with the newconcept that in a population of cancercells only a minority are stem cellswith the ability to produce new can-cer cells,\" explained Veronesi. ifstem the metastasis will disappear.\"Exploring his theory further, Veronesiis conducting a new trial wherewomen with positive sentinel nodesare being randomised to receiveeither axillary section or no treatment,with periodic PET (positron emissiontomography) examination and ultra-sound every six months. In the eventof a metastasis appearing, the womenwould undergo immediate surgery.\"We confidently expect the greatmajority of these women will notdevelop metastasis,\" he says, adding that ultimately they hope to identify amarker for stem cells that could beused to aid decision-making in sen-tinel node biopsy.Emiel Rutgers, from the NetherlandsCancer Institute, comments that theresults represent good news for sen-tinel node biopsy, but urges caution.\"These results are from a single insti-tution with extremely experiencedsurgeons, nuclear medicine doctorsand pathologists. It's a best case sce-nario which can't be expected totranslate to all centres,\" he says. Indeed, a recent phase III trial involv-ing about 140 centres, presented atthe San Antonio meeting inDecember, produced a false-negativerate of 9.7%. In other words, in aboutone in ten patients lymph nodemetastases in the axilla were missed 1. \"To me this is difficult to accept. It'sonly fair that when women have thisprocedure they're informed of therisks they're taking for that institu-tion,\" says Rutgers, adding thatincreasing the number of these proce-dures undertaken by individual sur-geons has been shown to decreasetheir failure rate of identifying thesentinel node. \"To be consideredcompetent, breasts surgeons need toundertake at least six sentinel nodeprocedures a month, but ideally itshould be 10 or 20.\" Furthermore, hesays, surgeons who offer this proce-dure to their patients need to workwithin an experienced 'SN-team',comprising an experienced breast sur-geon, nuclear medicine specialist andpathologist. Emiel Rutgers: Results are from a single institution. You can't expect them to bereplicated in centres with less experience Umberto Veronesi: Such low rates of false- negatives are widely accepted, given theadvantage of avoiding axillary side effects 1. Preliminary technical results of NSABP B-32, a randomised phase III clinical trial to comparesentinel node resection to conventional axillarydissection in clinically node-negative breast can-cer patients.InsideTrack Two years ago, the European Parliament passed a landmark resolution which set goals and standards for breast cancer services. It all started when a surgeon saved Karin J\u00f6ns MEPfrom an unnecessary mastectomy, and introduced her to the concept of specialist breastunits. \"This is what women need. You are a politician. Do something,\" he said. So she did. Karin J\u00f6ns has been a member of the European Parliament since 1994. InJune 1999, when she had just been re- elected, she was told that she had breast cancer.Her diagnosis and subsequent treatment havemade her a tenacious advocate of the rights ofEuropean women with breast cancer to have thebest possible diagnosis, treatment and care. Forsomeone who by her own admission becameinterested in breast cancer \"by accident\", shehas a remarkable record in attracting politicalsupport to the cause. J\u00f6ns was born in Germany and brought up in Sweden. As an MEP she now works betweenthree cities - Bremen, Brussels, and Strasbourg- and to add to the logistical problems, her hus-band also works abroad, currently in Tel Aviv.\"He was in Warsaw when I was diagnosed,\" saysJ\u00f6ns, who is clearly used to relying on her ownresources to get her through difficult times,though she adds \"during this time, we managedto see each other more often. It's true that tomeet we often have to undertake a top logisticalperformance, but it is always worth it!\" 26 CANCER WORLD JULY-AUGUST 2005\"At the time of my diagnosis - during a so-calledroutine mammography - my election posterswere still up all over the region,\" she says.\"Therefore I managed to get an appointmentwith four different specialists - today I wouldsay 'so-called specialists' - on the same day. Theyall wanted to do surgery, without any furtherexamination, in the next four days.\" But J\u00f6nswas unconvinced. She decided to ask aroundamong friends and physicians, including someoutside her region. By the next day she had found the address of what was at the time the only hospital inGermany that specialised in breast cancer,which was a few hundred kilometres from whereshe lived. \"The treatment started eight days later. If I had decided to go ahead with surgery and treat-ment in my own region, I am convinced that Iwould have had a total mastectomy instead ofbreast-conserving surgery. But even today many women do not have the chance to get quality treatment in a multi-disciplinary breast centre.\"Putting breast cancer on the political agenda How Karin J\u00f6ns MEP is helping improve breast care across Europe Mary RiceInsideTrack CANCER WORLD JULY-AUGUST 2005 27MAKING POLICY J\u00f6ns' greatest political achievement in the fight against breast cancer was the adoption of theresolution 'Breast Cancer in the EuropeanUnion' by the European Parliament in 2003. Ithad to be introduced as an 'own-initiative report',through a lengthy process which J\u00f6ns saysrequired both patience and perseverance. \"It isdifficult to get topics outside the general legisla-tive process onto the agenda, however importantthey may be. Thus everyone who wants to intro-duce an own-initiative report has to point outvery clearly to the different political groups whythe topic is more important than others andneeds to be discussed. This is even more diffi-cult when the report targets an issue, such asbreast cancer, where the European Union doesnot have any legislative competence.\" The breast cancer resolution was the first disease-specific resolution to go through theEuropean Parliament (since then, a resolutionon multiple sclerosis has also been adopted). Asrapporteur, J\u00f6ns had to overcome numerous obstacles. Even members of the Committee onWomen's Rights thought the demands were toofar-reaching. \"I had to find countless forms ofcompromise without watering down the essen-tial requirements for screening and treatment,\"she says. \"In the end, though, I think we had anexcellent resolution, acceptable to all, and final-ly adopted by the European Parliament withunanimity.\" It is a great achievement, but has the reso- lution really made a difference on the ground?J\u00f6ns is less sure about this. \"We really don'tknow at the moment. The resolution was onlyadopted two years ago and therefore MemberStates haven't had much time to implement it.\"One problem is that there is no central bodyable to monitor implementation and assesswhether national governments are complyingand increasing their efforts in the fight againstbreast cancer. However, J\u00f6ns is encouraged bythe fact that after the resolution was adopted MEPs hear about the importance of implementing breast screening in accordance with European guidelines at a meeting organised by the European Parliamentary Group on Breast Cancer and Europa Donna this January LEANNE FAIRLEYInsideTrack 28 CANCER WORLD JULY-AUGUST 2005by the Parliament, health ministers of the 15 states then in the EU (the EU-15) adopted arecommendation on cancer prevention thatadvises Member States to implement screeningprogrammes for breast, cervical and colorectalcancer. J\u00f6ns stresses that, with regard to bringing down mortality rates, the resolution called specif-ically for Member States to set themselves thetarget of creating theconditions required fora 25% reduction by slowlyand realisticenough to ask for feasi-ble changes within arealistic timeframe.\" She also points out that many of the10 states that joinedthe EU last year havevery different base-lines of cancer treat-ment to the EU-15,and have a long way togo before they canmeet the targets setout in the resolution.But this makes fight-ing for improvedbreast cancer servicesin these countries allthe more important. \"I would like to encouragewomen in all Member States to impress on bothphysicians and politicians the need for morequality assurance in the early detection andtreatment of breast cancer. Races for the cureand other charity events are important in aware-ness-raising, but even more important is thefight for structural changes in the entire care ofbreast cancer.\"Another aim of the resolution was to reduce the disparities in five-year survival from 16% to 5%by 2008. There is little evidence to show thatthis is underway, but J\u00f6ns is optimistic. She citesas examples France, where the national screen-ing programme has been completely revised,Germany, which has met the requirements tohopefully implement a countrywide screeningprogramme by the end of this year, and Hungary, where she says hugeprogress has beenmade in screening. She also points out that MemberStates are now debat-ing the introduction ofspecialist breast units,and that, despite thecurrent lack of clearEU guidelines for thecertification of breastunits, a great deal ofprogress has beenmade in setting upspecialist units innational hopes work of BreastCancer is require- ments of EUSOMA [the European Society ofMastology], which will be published by theEuropean Commission at the end of this year.\" CHANGING PRACTICE There is no doubt that, in order to improve sur-vival rates, both quality-assured early detectionand optimal treatment in multidisciplinarybreast units are needed, says J\u00f6ns. However, this \"I had to find countless forms of compromise without watering down the essential requirements\" TRISTAN VANKANNInsideTrack CANCER WORLD JULY-AUGUST 2005 29returns once more to the question of compli- ance by Member States. You can have all theresolutions and good intentions in the world, butif no-one is chasing up those who are supposedto implement them, there probably won't bemuch change. J\u00f6ns is well aware of this problem. \"As Members of the European Parliament, we needto maintain strong relationships with our col-leagues in national and regional parliaments. Wemust pass on to them information aboutprogress made in other countries. And weshould not forget to keep breast cancer on theagenda in the European Parliament.\" She also hopes to convince the new European Commission to submit a mid-term review on theimplementation of the resolution in 2006. Thiswould provide essential information about whathas been done across Europe, which could be usedto identify best practice and provide referencepoints to measure progress across the EU - so-called 'benchmarking'. J\u00f6ns is grateful for the sup-port she received from David Byrne, who wasHealth Commissioner until last May, and says sheis very hopeful that the new Health Commissioner,Markos Kyprianou, will be as good an ally. But perhaps the most important ally in ensuring that the aims of the breast cancer res-olution become reality, says J\u00f6ns, is the patientadvocacy movement. \"Without Europa Donnawe would not be where we are today in the fightagainst breast cancer. They provided excellentinformation from their national groups in thedrafting of the resolution and they are nowworking consistently on the dissemination of theterms of the resolution in the old and newMember States.\" As rapporteur on breast cancer,she says she received support from a range ofadvocacy groups, and she is confident that thissort of Europe-wide collaboration will continueto influence practice at both European andnational level.PERSONAL AND POLITICAL J\u00f6ns acknowledges that, had she not had breastcancer herself, this subject might not be so highon her political agenda. Having had her surgery ina multidisciplinary unit, it was her surgeon whofirst introduced her to the EUSOMA require-ments for breast units. \"He gave me a copy of thefirst draft and said: 'This is what women need.You are a politician. Do something.'\" In the beginning, she says, it wasn't easy. She started by working with Europa Donna tobuild support for a cross-party EuropeanParliamentary Group on breast cancer, whichhas been key to the subsequent work. TheGroup also acts as a forum where there is a con-stant exchange of information and opinions onbreast cancer issues. The topic for its next meet-ing is the use of structural funds for the imple-mentation of mammography screening. This,says J\u00f6ns, is one of the most important questionsin healthcare reform and setting up new pro-grammes, especially in new Member States. It all bodes well for the future of breast can- cer treatment in Europe, but does J\u00f6ns ever feelthe need to get involved in some of the less'fashionable' cancers, such as lung, prostate, orcolon, which receive far less media coverage andwhere patients seem more reluctant - or lessable - to speak out? \"It is true,\" says J\u00f6ns, \"that breast cancer is high on the political agenda, but this has beenachieved by women themselves, united inEuropa Donna or other initiatives that havebeen working hard to raise public awareness ofthe disease. In the EU-25, a woman is diag-nosed with breast cancer every six minutes.Every two minutes a woman dies from this dis-ease. We ourselves have gathered together andorganised, and learnt more about the fightagainst breast cancer. Men can do this too!\" She admits that women may find it easier to speak more openly about breast cancer than\"Things change slowly and I was realistic enough to ask for feasible changes within a realistic timeframe\"InsideTrack 30 CANCER WORLD JULY-AUGUST 2005men would about prostate cancer, for example, but says: \"This difference is not God given. Ifmen know how to talk about the stock market,for example, why cannot they speak about can-cer?\" She also argues that there are still notenough women in politics and society who areprepared to say that they are breast cancerpatients or survivors. \"This is one area where wecan learn a lot from the USA.\" J\u00f6ns refutes the suggestion that other can- cers have been forgotten at European level. Shepoints out that screening for cervical and col-orectal cancers is included in the EC recom-mendations on cancer prevention, and that theframework research programme includes fund-ing for projects in prostate cancer andleukaemia. She also mentions a new Europeancampaign against tobacco, which will help fightthe increase in lung cancer. As for breast cancer, despite the successes, J\u00f6ns argues that there is still a great deal left todo. She is looking forward to the publication ofthe fourth edition of the European guidelines onmammography screening, which will include,for the first time, guidelines for digital screen-ing, and will have integrated evidence-basedrequirements for breast units and criteria fortheir accreditation. \"To have these documents athand will be a big step forward for quality assur-ance in breast cancer.\" She is also looking towards a second resolu- tion on breast cancer, once data on the imple-mentation of the original resolution becomeavailable. Looking back on it, rarely can the exhorta- tion \"Do something!\" have been met with a morecommitted and effective response. And hun-dreds of thousands of women in Europe havecause to be thankful that J\u00f6ns not only didsomething, but looks set to continue fightingtheir corner on breast cancer services for manyyears to come. \"We ourselves have got together and learnt to fight against breast cancer.

Two new oncological publications offer equal value in terms of their scientific and medical content. Where they differ is in their approach to patients and in their human vision. Two clinical oncology books have recently hit the market: Clinical oncology , a blockbuster textbook of more than 3000 pages, and the moremodestly sized Manual of clinical oncology . The first of these, edited by Abeloff et al, is a heavyweight workvery similar in form to its main rivalCancer: Principles and practice ofoncology (De Vita et al., reviewed in the last issue of Cancer World). Clinical oncology is divided into three main parts. Part one presents thebasic science of oncology, part twoaddresses problems relating to cancerand cancer therapy, and part three isdevoted to each specific malignancy,including childhood cancers.The book offers an impressive array ofinformation on science and clinicalmedicine, including an in-depth chap-ter on alternative medicine, and read-ers will find it a mine of informationon almost every issue pertaining to thebiological and somatic aspects of can-cer. But, while the authors stress theimportance of a multimodal approachto cancer therapy, they almost com-pletely ignore the psychologicalaspects and their book suffers fromthe same misconception as DeVita's -namely that the disease, rather thanthe patient, is the heart of the matter. There is barely a trace of the 'human-ism' of which the editors boast in theirpreface. The strong point of theAbeloff textbook, compared toDeVita, is its generous four-colourdesign and user-friendly layout. Itsweak point is the lack of detail in thetable of contents and the limitationsof the accompanying CD-ROM,which only contains illustrations fea-tured in the book.The second of the two books, the Manual of clinical oncology , is edited by Casciato et al. Oncology fellows,residents and general physicianssearching for a handy, concise, up-to-date, comprehensive textbook ononcology will greatly appreciate thiswork. Although similar in structure toAbeloff, here, specific malignancies are advantageously addressed in a uni-form format, and attention is given toproviding information useful for mak-ing diagnostic and therapeutic deci-sions at the bedside of cancerpatients. What makes this thoroughlyupdated 5th edition really differentfrom other oncology manuals is thehuman vision it conveys and the cen-tral role it affords to patients. The aimof the Manual , writes Casciato, is to \"provide the caregiver with the ability to temper today's popular inter-ventions with good judgmentand cautious open-mindednessto the promise of tomorrow.\" Incontrast to the more heavyweightoncology textbooks, Casciatosucceeds in fusing together thetechnical, clinical and humanapproaches in oncology. Thebook has a soul, and it owesmuch to Barry B. Lowitz, co-edi-tor of the first four editions, whose humanism is felt throughoutthe book, as in the wonderful chapter\"Talking with Cancer Patients andtheir Families.\" His witty remarks arealso a plus.

Itprovides coverage of all the mainissues of concern, from the anatomi-cal to the oncological and surgical -both ablative and reconstructive.The book also presents data of statisti-cal value amassed by some of the lead-ing researchers and institutions in thefield. Written by European specialists,it covers almost the entire domain ofhand tumours, benign and malignant.The latter include not only squamouscell the hand and wrist.Fortunately, tumours of the hand tendto be identified relatively early, sincethey are more noticeable than othertumours, and the prognosis is there-fore generally more positive.For non-specialists, and even morefor patients, brachytherapy - derived from the Greek root brachus(short) - sounds barbaric and threat-ening. It consists in the delivery ofradiation therapy at short range, usingcapsules or other sealed sources thatare placed as close as possible to thesite being treated.Written by leading British experts inthis field, this small book manages tomake brachytherapy understandableto physicians and other professionals.The short, clear chapters, full ofhelpful illustrations, provide readerswith the scientific fundamentals inthe physics and dosimetry of thetechnique, and with practical guide-lines on its use in common diseasesites.The book covers low-, medium- andhigh-dose-rate techniques, but themain emphasis is on high-dose-rateafterloading techniques, which allowthe radioactive material to be insertedafter the capsule has been placed. Incombination with external beam radio-therapy, brachytherapy allows higherdoses to be used with less damage tosurrounding organs compared to exter-nal beam techniques.Tumors of the hand Edited by Daniel V.

Oral morphine has become themainstay of therapy for serious cancerpain therapy, at least in the Westernworld, and specialists now agree thatpain can be relieved in 70%-90% ofcancer patients. Yet an increasingbody of evidence shows that cancerpain is often poorly assessed andundertreated. According to the editors of Cancer pain, the main reason for this lies in inadequate healthcare and poor pro-fessional education, which result inprejudice and a failure to actively lis-ten on the part of many healthcareprofessionals, particularly physicians.Written by an international team ofcontributors, Cancer pain provides a truly comprehensive, clinically orient-ed, scholarly review of all aspects ofthis complex, multidimensional issue,including the ethical foundations ofpain in medical illness and the partic-ular way pain manifests itself in spe-cific populations such as the elderlyand children.changed diagnostic evaluation, partic- ularly in the detection of metastases.The other is chemotherapy, which hasbeen shown to be effective and is nowbeing used in conjunction with sur-gery and radiotherapy. Despite these advances, lung cancerremains the number one killer amongcancers in most of the Western world,and the majority of lung cancer patientsare still being diagnosed at a late stagein the illness (IIIB or IV). The culprit is,alas, well known and Tr\u00e9daniel rightlydevotes two lengthy chapters to epi-demiology and prevention.Astoul's book, the first in French onmalignant pleural mesothelioma, is ofan equally high standard.

Due to the long latency ofthe disease (30-40 years), these work-ers are expected to develop malignantmesothelioma in the near future, inwhat Astoul terms \"a tremendous fail-ure of preventive medicine.\" Two French publications give acomplete and up-to-date picture of lung cancer and pleural mesothe-lioma.

Of note, among the lat-ter, are chapters on psychologicalinterventions and rehabilitation med-icine interventions (ambulatory aids,massages, acupuncture, prayer, etc.).While rehabilitation disciplines havemuch to offer cancer patients in pain,observes Theresa Gillis, \"access torehabilitation disciplines is frequentlylimited by knowledge amongoncologists, patients and rehabilita-tionists themselves.\" The book is ahelpful resource for all those dealingwith cancer pain - physicians, nursesand medical students alike. Grand Round 12 CANCER WORLD JULY-AUGUST 2005Aclinical trial of breast can- cer treatment in Europeis about to set new stan-dards for the future ofresearch by focusing on the molecular biology of tumours,rather than simply asking whether onetreatment is better than another. This is the first large trial any- where in the world to put to the testthe best system for choosing whichtumours respond best to which treat-ment. It could put Europe in the fore-front of the drive to target treatmentsto the genetic fingerprint of individualbreast cancers. But this revolutionary approach is being held back by a culture ofbureaucracy, lack of coordination andlack of funding which threatensEurope-wide research. The EuropeanCommission says it has learned les-sons from an avalanche of criticism. Itmay have one last chance to putmoney where it is needed and to remove barriers that hold backEurope's scientists and clinicians,before cutting edge research movesdecisively to the USA or to .Chinaand other parts of Asia. The world's first trial of tailored treatments, MINDACT, is beingmasterminded by TRANSBIG - thetranslational research arm of theBreast International Group - from asmall office in the Jules BordetInstitute in Brussels. It will analysethe molecular biology of every tumourin the trial, to gain information onwhich types of tumour respond bestto which types of treatment. MINDACT (MIcroarray for Node negative Disease may AvoidChemoTherapy) aims to find outwhether the genetic signature (geneexpression profile) of an early-stagebreast cancer tumour is more effec-tive than traditional clinical andpathological criteria at predicting which women will benefit from adju-vant chemotherapy following surgery.The ultimate aim is to avoid givingchemotherapy to women who do notneed it - to the benefit of bothpatients and health care budgets. It is a huge logistical challenge that requires lab-based specialists ingenomics, proteomics and bioinfor-matics in a number of centres aroundEurope to work in harmony with hos-pital-based clinicians - medicaloncologists, surgeons, pathologistsand nurses. More than 6,000 patients will be recruited and enrolled by more thantwo hundred centres in Europe, LatinAmerica, and in other countries aroundthe world. Clinicians will use currentclinical and pathological criteria to cat-egorise each patient as high or low risk. Tumour tissue will be sent to Milan for pathology quality control. Anna WagstaffEuropean research crisis: the cancer community must make its voice heard The European Union aims to become \"the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world\".

And why is a world-beating breast cancertrial left short of funding and support?CANCER WORLD JULY-AUGUST 2005 13Grand Round Philippe Busquin, former Commissioner for Research, was a leading force behind the 2000 'Lisbon agenda', which aimed to turn the E U into the world's leading knowledge-based economy. But his recent book, The Decline of the European Scientific Empire , strikes a pessimistic note Grand Round Meanwhile, frozen tumour tissue samples will be sent to theNetherlands Cancer Institute (NKI)in Amsterdam, where genomics spe-cialists will work with the microarraycompany Agendia to categorise themas high risk or low risk according to aprognostic gene expression pattern -known as the '70-gene signature' orMamaPrint - which was developedin Amsterdam. Patients categorised as high risk by both methods will be treated withchemotherapy, and those categorisedas low risk by both will be treatedwith hormonal therapy (so long astheir tumours express hormonereceptors). Those categorised as highrisk by one method and low risk bythe other will randomly have theirtreatment decided either by clinical-pathological criteria or by genetic sig-nature. The hypothesis being testedis that the genomic signature willprove a more accurate marker of risk, 14 CANCER WORLD JULY-AUGUST 2005techniques will be essential if cancertreatment centres are to be able to acton the outcome of the trial. To add to the complexity, two addi- tional questions are posed in this trial.Patients treated with chemotherapywill receive either anthracycline or tax-ane plus capecitabine, with the aim ofcomparing their efficacy and seriousside-effects. Patients treated with hor-monal therapy will receive either 2years tamoxifen plus 5 years aromataseinhibitor, or 7 years aromatase inhibitor. As far as the scientists are con- cerned, these are tag-on questions,but revealingly, their inclusion willfinance much of the trial.Pharmaceutical companies have nogreat interest in differentiating high-risk from low-risk patients, but find-ing markers that predict whichpatients respond best to their prod-ucts is of value to them, so thechemotherapy and hormone therapyquestions tie in their support. MINDACT is a magnificent trial opening up new frontiers in theprized and fast-expanding field of'omics' biotechnology. It will take asizable step towards true individu-alised treatment in the future basedon the 'fingerprint' of a woman'stumour. It should be the pride and joyof the European Union (EU) which,at a landmark conference in Lisbonfive years ago, committed itself tobecoming \"the most competitive anddynamic knowledge-based economyin the world by 2010\". The sad reality, however, is that MINDACT, like most Europeanresearch, receives far too little funding,relies on clinicians doing research intheir 'spare time', struggles with theheaviest clinical trials regulation in theworld, and depends on a continuallydepleted pool of European scientificexpertise as researchers are attracted byfunding and career prospects in the US.and so reduce unnecessary chemo- therapy. Meanwhile, tumour and blood samples from every patient will beflown to a proteomics lab in Wales,where specialists will analyse theirprotein profiles, to try to identify \"pro-tein signatures\" associated with risk,or with responses to particular thera-pies. Many scientists believe that pro-teins will ultimately prove more use-ful than genes in distinguishing can-cers, and this method requires onlyblood rather than frozen tissue. One of the main aims of TRANS- BIG is to develop user-friendly toolsfor risk assessment and to predictresponse. To this end, molecular biol-ogists will use polymeric chain reac-tion (PCR) and other widely usedtechniques to determine whether thegenetic profile of the tumour can beevaluated using these less expensiveand less demanding methods.Validation of such straightforward Source: European Cancer Research Funding Survey , European Cancer Research Managers Forum, 2005.

Some 400,000European scientists are currentlyworking in the US, and a survey pub-lished last year by the Commissionindicated that only 13% are currentlyintending to return home. While 15years ago the pharmaceutical indus-try invested 50% more in the Europethan in the US, today it is investing40% more in the US than in Europe,and Europe's base of expertise indrug development has suffered as aconsequence. Today, the US itselffears being overtaken by the fastgrowing economies of China andSouth Asia, which are investing heav-ily in biotechnology. For the firsttime, the number of scientists fromthese regions returning home fromjobs in the US is outstripping thenumber flowing the other way.American analysts predict a serious shortfall in scientific personnel - andthis will exert a further pull onEurope's postgraduates. No wonder former Commissioner for Research, Philippe Busquin issounding the alarm. His book, The Decline of the European ScientificEmpire , charts the path of European science from after the Second WorldWar to the present day. He issues a ral-lying cry for European leaders to sup-port the vision of a knowledge-led econ-omy set out in Lisbon in 2000, and tofulfil their pledge to increase fundingfor research and development to 3% ofgross domestic product (GDP). THE FUNDING GAP The cancer research community hasbeen complaining about the shortfallin European research funding formany years. The European CancerResearch Managers (ECRM) Forum- a body supported by the EU - com-missioned a study into non-commer- cial funding of cancer research inEurope, which published its results atthe end of March 2005. Even theywere shocked at what they found. Europe spends 2.56 euros per head on cancer research - oneseventh of the 17.63 euros per headspent in the US (see Table 1). If theten countries that joined last year areexcluded, the figure rises slightly, toone-fifth of the US per capita spend.Moreover, government agenciesaccount for only half of the totalEuropean spend of 1.43 billion euros,the rest coming from charities. Inother words, Europe's cancer researchrelies on philanthropy (see Table 2). Funding of cancer research via EU research grants came to 90 mil-lion euros. This was sufficient tofinance only one in five fundableprojects, and only 50% of the projectsjudged to be of a very high standard. No country comes out of the sur- vey well, but there are some real sur-prises. At 6.43 euros per head,Sweden ranks second after the UK inper capita spend on cancer research,but only 0.56 euros of this comesfrom the government, with more than90% being contributed by Swedishcancer charities. The Swedish gov-ernment contribution is only 0.002%of GDP. This compares with 0.0078%in Slovenia, 0.0063% in the SlovakRepublic, 0.0063% in Estonia, and0.0042% in Lithuania - all poorercountries that could be expected toconcentrate more heavily on serviceprovision rather than research. Sweden is by no means the worst. Out of 31 countries in the EuropeanFree Trade Area, it ranks 17th on can-cer research spend as a proportion ofGDP - ahead of Italy, the Netherlandsand Iceland, (23rd to 25th). InDenmark and Austria, ranked 27thand 28th, the governments spend aGrand Round Half of all European cancer research funding comes from charities. This reflects very poorly on government funding - it also highlights the importance of involving cancer charities in strategicplanning at national and European levelsTABLE 2.

This goes some way to explaining why even flagship research projectssuch as the MINDACT trial, whichuses precisely the cutting-edge tech-niques and technologies the EU saysit will invest in, is finding it hard toget sufficient funding. This technology doesn't come cheap and MINDACT will costaround 30 million euros. Althoughthe EU Research FrameworkProgramme promises support for\"clinical research aimed at validatinginterventions\", its support for theMINDACT trial is only indirect.TRANSBIG has been given 7 millioneuro under the EU Networks ofExcellence Programme, to be spentlargely on the network's \"integratingactivities\" related to MINDACT.None of this money will go towardsthe costs of the actual clinical trial ormicroarray studies. TRANSBIG is urging national governments and health insurers tocontribute towards the costs, follow-ing the lead of the Dutch medicalhealth insurers who helped financesome of the clinical research with the70-gene signature. So far, however,not one government or health insurerhas pledged any funds. Fatima Cardoso, TRANSBIG's scientific coordinator, is baffled at thelack of support. \"You would think thata trial like MINDACT, which has thepotential of telling you that we canreduce the number of chemotherapyprescriptions by 10-20%, would be of 16 CANCER WORLD JULY-AUGUST 2005extreme interest to governments,health insurance companies and theCommission,\" she said. CLINICAL TRIALS - THE POOR RELATION One of the six key messages from theECRM survey is that the fundingshortage is \"seriously damaging\" clini-cal research. The gap between US and European funding for clinical cancerresearch is even greater than that forbasic research. One reason is thatmost clinical trials need to be con-ducted at an international level torecruit enough patients, yet nationalcharities and government researchfunds rarely contribute to the interna-tional initiatives. One key recommen-dation from the survey is for greatercoordination between major non-commercial funding bodies atEuropean level. Another reason is the EU refuses to help fund clinical trials, despite thefact that most cannot be undertakenby a national group acting alone.Fran\u00e7oise Meunier, Director Generalof the European Organisation forResearch and Treatment of Cancer(EORTC), which is running the clin-ical arm of MINDACT and is respon-sible for the vast majority of clinicaltrials in Europe, is exasperated at thislack of support. She has spent yearstrying to convince the Commission toaccept a responsibility for helping tofund non-commercial clinicalresearch. The Commission says that this research is too expensive for publicfunding and should be financed bycancer charities, national governments and the pharmaceutical companies.The net result is that clinical research- which has the greatest immediateimpact on patient care - is left largelyin the hands of the industry. However,as Meunier has tried to explain, manyclinical trials are of no interest to thepharmaceutical industry. Pharmaceutical companies focus their attention on the four mostprevalent cancers - breast, lung,prostate and colorectal. There are reg-ulatory incentives to encourage com-panies to research treatments for 'rarediseases', but most cancers do notqualify as rare. Meunier points outthat breakthrough drugs like temozo-lamide glioblastoma as imatinib in gastro-intestinal stromaltumour (GIST) came out of academ-ic research. Child cancers is another neglect- ed area. Companies may soon have toprovide data on the use of their drugsin paediatric populations, whereappropriate, as a condition of gettingapproval. However, as children rarelysuffer from the cancers that are com-mon in adults, this is unlikely to be ofgreat use. Conversely, the vast majori-ty of children's cancers are rarelyfound in adults; the question is whowill fund research into these diseases? Some clinical trials do not concern drugs at all. Many important benefitshave resulted from refining radiothera-py techniques, improving surgical pro-cedures, and finding more effectiveways to combine radiotherapy, surgeryand drug treatment. If only drug trialswere funded, women would still rou- Doctors and nurses who want to participate in research usually have to do it in their spare timeCANCER WORLD JULY-AUGUST 2005 17tinely lose their breasts and throat can- cer patients their voice boxes. Lack of funding means that the EORTC has to be highly selective,and as a result many urgent questionsregarding treatment options are sim-ply not investigated. This situation isexacerbated by the extra costs associ-ated with the EU Clinical TrialsDirective, which came into force inMay 2004 (see box). MISSING THE DRUGS TRAIN Silvia Marsoni, head of the Milan-based Southern Europe New DrugOrganisation (SENDO), says thatlack of investment is also crippling the EU's ability to compete in thepotentially lucrative drug develop-ment market. Advances in molecularbiology offer the promise of effectivetreatments for many diseases andeven have the potential to alter natu-ral physiological processes such asageing. Economically, this representsa goldmine. \"The China, Indiaand field,\" says Marsoni. \"The EUrisks missing the train.\" Europe lost much of its pharma- ceutical industry to the US intakeovers and mergers in the 1980sand '90s. However, a lot of innovative work is now coming from smaller sci-ence-driven biotechnology compa-nies, and the EU is pinning its hopeson this sector. Marsoni says that some coun- tries, such as the UK, France andSweden, are trying to create an envi-ronment to ease the route from scien-tific discovery to marketable product.But in much of Europe, this is not thecase. \"The concept of venture capitaldoes not exist in Italy. You cannot geta loan unless you have a house to giveas security.\" But even a thriving European biotech sector will not develop drugsand take them to market without scien-tific expertise in many different areas. SENDO is one of very few non- commercial bodies to offer drugdevelopment services in Europe,along with Cancer Research UK andthe EORTC. It struggles to maintaina base of drug development expertisein Europe, without which the biotechcompanies will have to look else-where. Marsoni says, \"It's a niche area. You need very skilled people, and youneed to invest in them. It takes mefive years to train up good people.Unless I have money to pay for theirtraining, it's not going to happen.\" Inaddition, the Clinical Trials Directivehas made research so much morebureaucratic that SENDO had to hirethree extra people just to deal withthe paperwork. If the EU is to avoid being left behind, it will need to simplify itsbureaucracy and start investing ininfrastructure and research personnel- from clinicians to scientists anddata managers. Marsoni says that Europe has a short period of breathing space,because the rush to develop Glivec-style treatments aimed at a single tar-Grand Round THE CLINICAL TRIALS DIRECTIVE Europe's spectacular own goal In May 2003, the EU adopted a directive governing the way clinical trials are conduct- ed. Clinical researchers hoped this might boost trans-European clinical research byharmonising national regulations governing insurance requirements, ethical approval,reporting requirements and so on. It didn't.Not only did the Clinical Trials Directive leave the original obstacles in place, but it addednew ones. Each trial is now obliged to have a 'sponsoring' research body or institution.Among a raft of bureaucratic, financial and legal obligations, the sponsors will berequired to pay for every drug used by every patient enrolled in the trial, and to meetthe costs of any inspections. The requirements of data validation and reporting go wellbeyond anything that regulatory bodies demand when assessing a new drug forapproval, and in many cases the researchers find themselves having to report the samedata in two different ways in order to satisfy both EU and national requirements.The Directive was drawn up by the directorate general for Enterprise as a 'single-marketmeasure'. It aimed to provide a level playing field for the free movement of medicinesin the EU, and therefore included regulations on how the pharmaceutical industry con-ducts its research on patients. But it ended up dragging down non-commercial researchin the same net.Europe's research community warned at the time that the Directive could threaten thefuture of non-commercial clinical trials. They have been proved right. At the end of April,almost exactly one year after the directive came into force, the EORTC, Cancer ResearchUK and other bodies involved in clinical research sat down with the Commission and rep-resentatives of the member states to report on the damage. They were able to show thatall over Europe non-commercial trials activity has been reduced by 50% while the costsand the administrative burden have doubled. The new requirement for sponsorship hasstopped many national clinical trial groups from opening any centres in other EU coun-tries. Though the point has been proved, the Directive will stand unless Europe's cancerresearchers mount concerted pressure to force the EU to rethink its whole approach.Grand Round get turned out to be a blind alley - but the next decisions have to be the rightones. \"Five years ago, when the publicunderstood the potential of molecularbiology, we thought that with thegenome we were on our way to solvingthe problem. Now we know we aredealing with pathways and networks.We are in a period of reflection. Eitherwe understand what we have to doand we do it within 2005-2006, or wewill definitely miss the train.\" LOSING THE LISBON PLOT The Lisbon conference, which set thegoal for Europe to lead the world in aknowledge-based economy, set out astrategy to build a European ResearchArea and Networks of Excellence inpriority areas. These were spelt out inthe Sixth Framework Programme(FP6) drawn up by the Commission'sDirectorate General for Research,covering the period 2002-2006. FP6 was given twice the budget of its predecessor. \"Life sciences,genomics and biotechnology forhealth\" is one of seven major themes,within which support is concentratedon advanced genomics and applica-tions for health and combating majordisease. The priorities are a cancer researcher's dream. Basic researchincludes gene expression and pro-teomics, structural genomics, bio-informatics, multidisciplinaryapproaches in functional genomicsand fundamental biological processesand the application of knowledge andtechnologies in the use of biotechnolo-gy for heath. It also includes the devel- 18 CANCER WORLD JULY-AUGUST 2005opment of patient-oriented strategiesfor diagnosis and treatment, transla-tional research and clinical researchaimed at validating interventions. Some researchers argue that it not only reads like a dream, but is justas insubstantial. While a number ofbasic science projects have benefitedfrom FP6 funding, scientists com-plain that funding instruments defineresearch topics too narrowly, forcepeople into unhappy partnerships,involve small businesses where theydon't belong, and create an adminis-trative nightmare. To top it all, the EORTC itself is disqualified from receiving supporteven as a Network of Excellence,because only new networks are eligi-ble for support. The same rule wasapplied to disqualify the BreastInternational Group (BIG), whichreceives no support from govern-ments or the EU. TRANSBIG wascreated as a new consortium to getaround this requirement. YOU WILL STUDY X The Commission allocates mostresearch grants after putting out callsfor proposals on topics specified with-in the Framework Agreement. It hasjustified this approach by referring tothe need to build a \"critical mass\" inpriority areas. Richard Sullivan, director of Clinical Research at CancerResearch UK, Europe's largest cancerresearch organisation, says that scien-tific innovation is not amenable tothis top down approach. \"The whole point about innova-tion and pushing back the frontiers of science is that you can't predict inwhich direction it is going to go.Programme grants need to be veryflexible and cover broad domains, andthey need to be driven from the bot-tom up.\" Defining research topics narrowly is a particular problem becausebureaucratic organisations like theCommission are slow to respond toevents. \"You need to be able to reactvery quickly when somebody says,'this is hot, it needs to be done in thenext few months and it will revolu-tionise this area of work.' You arealways guessing the future.\" YOU WILL COLLABORATE WITH Y Researchers responding to a call areobliged to form a consortium to meetstrict guidelines about involving anumber of countries, particularlythose with a poorer research base. The theory is that the EU can make the value of research inMember States greater than the sumof its parts through promoting collab-oration and minimising fragmentationand duplication of research. But here too, Sullivan argues, the EU has got it wrong. \"There is littleevidence to show European cancerresearch is fragmented.\" Indeed, while the ECRM survey identified 138 major funders of can-cer research in Europe, more than80% of that funding came from only25 organisations. What is needed saysSullivan is more communication andcollaboration between these bodies tosupport transnational research.Scientific innovation is not amenable to the top-down approachCANCER WORLD JULY-AUGUST 2005 19European cancer also has a highly developed system of internationalcooperative groups - lymphomagroups, breast groups, groups for pae-diatric oncologists, groups for radio-therapists. European clinicalresearchers have worked together inEORTC for decades. Sullivan says, \"Everybody knows who everybody else is. You know whoyour competitors are. You are eithercooperating with them because it ismutually beneficial, or you are in ruth-less competition with them, becauseyou are working in the same area.\" He says that forcing people to collaborate as a condition of fundingis counterproductive since true scien-tific collaboration cannot be imposed. One scientist, who had benefited from an FP6 Network grant, put itthis way: \"We collaborate with whowe want to collaborate with, and wedon't collaborate with who we don'twant to collaborate with.\" He saidthat the rules create sham partner-ships where partners do not reallywork with one another. \"It's just a wayof getting the money.\" YOU WILL INVOLVE THE PRIVATE SECTOR Another irritation has been the fre-quent requirement to include at leastone small or medium enterprise(SME). The rationale is to speed upthe translation of research intomarketable results, by narrowing thegap between scientists and privateenterprise. However, the questions that aca- demic researchers want answered donot always coincide with the prioritiesof profit-driven companies.The experience of TRANSBIG is revealing. Despite reservations, theyagreed to include Agendia, the com-pany that developed the microarrayplatform used in Amsterdam to gen-erate the '70-gene signature', withinthe consortium. Meanwhile, a groupin Rotterdam conducted a similarstudy using a different company anda different platform. Their studyidentified a 76-gene signature, whichseems equally effective at differenti-ating tumours, but has only threegenes in common with itsAmsterdam rival. Naturally TRANSBIG scientists are eager to compare the Rotterdamand Amsterdam platforms and signa-tures. Equally naturally, Agendia wouldprefer their platform to be the only onevalidated. As part of the consortium,Agendia has a say in how MINDACTproceeds. The trial steering committeethink they have found a way to resolvethe problem, but they are strongly urg-ing the Commission to drop therequirement to include SMEs in future. RED TAPE The biggest complaint is about redtape. To comply with EU require-ments, consortia are required to fill ina level of paperwork before, duringand after a project that beggars belief,and is entirely inappropriate for aca-demics and small businesses thathave no civil service and very littleadministrative support. After applying for his first EU grant, Steve West, a leading scientiststudying DNA repair mechanisms,says, \"never again\". Sitting on his deskis the completed application - a pileof paper 10-cm thick. West estimates that only 20 pages of this are relevantto the science. Although the grant is large, it has to be spread across 15 labs. When hecompares this with the nine- or ten-page research proposals required byother bodies, West concludes that itis not worth the hassle. He is not alone. In a consultation on the future of European researchcarried out by the Commission in2004, the anger and frustration at redtape was identified as the \"single mostrecurrent message of the consulta-tion\". LISBON RELAUNCHED There are encouraging signs that theCommission is trying to take on boardmany of these complaints. Publishingits proposals for FP7 in April, it said,\"The expansion of the scope, spanand volume of EU action in researchrequires, as a condition sine qua non,a substantial simplification and ratio-nalisation of the way the FrameworkProgramme Works.\" It talks of \"reducing the burden of administrative and financial rules andprocedures,\" judging value on resultsrather than by controls, and says thattheir general approach \"will be one oftrust towards the researchers.\"Recognising that projects have beentoo tightly defined, it talks of \"focusingmore on themes than on instruments\"and promises sufficientflexibility to accommodate emergingtopics. It even talks about \"investiga-tor-driven research\", and proposes thecreation of a European ResearchCouncil, led by leading members ofGrand Round Consortia are required to fill in a level of paperwork that beggars beliefGrand Round the scientific community, which would control 15% of the research budget. \"The new 7th Framework Programme,\" says the Commission ina tacit admission of the level of disil-lusionment, \"will not be 'just anotherFramework Programme'. In its con-tent, organisation, implementationmodes and management tools, it isdesigned as a key contribution to there-launched Lisbon strategy.\" To support this, the Commission proposes doubling the FP7 budget to67.8 billion euros over a longer time-frame of seven years. It predicts thatthis will lever 93 eurocents of privateinvestment in research and develop-ment for each extra 1 euro of publicfunding, which \"will boost businessconfidence that Europe delivers on itscommitments and offers an attractivefuture.\" It is easy to be sceptical. But it would be churlish not to recognise thereal effort the Commission is makingto move European research up a gear,and members of the cancer researchcommunity now need to ensure thattheir own governments back this effortwith political support and hard cash. Over the next two years, the FP7 proposals will be debated by theEuropean Parliament and in theCouncil of Ministers. This is wherethe cancer research community has achance to lobby for improvements -for instance to allow non-commercialclinical trials to apply for EU funding,or to relax the requirements on forcedcollaboration or the involvement ofSMEs. This is also traditionally wherenational governments and powerful 20 CANCER WORLD JULY-AUGUST 2005vested interests indulge in the sort oftit for tat horse-trading that so oftenreduces initially coherent proposals toineffective and unworkable legislation- for which they then turn round andblame the Commission. Some governments, including Germany, are threatening to cut backtheir domestic research budget tofinance the increased contributionsbeing requested by the EU - in fact sofar only the UK has given a commit-ment that it will not do this.Governments may also not be veryopen to suggestions that researchersshould be freed from their onerousreporting requirements and the rela-tionship should be one based on\"trust\" - in fact many have spentrecent years insisting the Commissiontighten up its accounting and report-ing requirements, following accusa-tions of massive waste. There are alsoplenty of vested interests who may notbe keen to see a strong EuropeanResearch Council with the authorityand independence to follow a purelyresearch-driven agenda. The cancer research community will need to make its voice heard. THE HOME FRONT It is, however, at national level thatthe future of European cancerresearch will be decided. The contri-bution made via the EU research pro-gramme, after all, accounts for onlyaround 6% of the total spending oncancer research in Europe, althoughthis proportion will increase in 2007. More importantly, it is within national academic and health systemsthat Europe's young researchers are nurtured. The career prospects,research opportunities and generalculture within these systems are keydeterminants of whether scientistsstay or head for the US, and whetherclinicians get involved in clinical andtranslational research. One consistentcomplaint from cancer doctorsthroughout Europe is how few incen-tives there are for clinicians to doresearch, particularly outside the topresearch institutes and teachinghospitals. Cardoso fears, for instance, that many centres will not be able to par-ticipate in MINDACT because oflack of back up, and that there will besome European countries with nocentre taking part. \"Research shouldnot be looked at as something of aluxury that smaller hospitals shouldn'teven think about it. Most importantis a change of mentality among thepeople who decide where the moneygoes and those who run the hospitals.In almost all centres, doctors andnurses who want to do research haveto do it in their spare time. There isno time dedicated to research withinyour working hours, so you have towork double for the same pay.\" Sullivan, of Cancer Research UK, calls for the promotion of a \"researchculture\". \"You have to have the samepro-research message at every level,from the funders and government allthe way through to the front-line ofcancer healthcare delivery and uni-versities. It's not something you do fora couple of weeks and hang it up. Youhave to carve out extra time and offerSome governments may cut their domestic research budget to offset higher contributions to the EUCANCER WORLD JULY-AUGUST 2005 21real career pathways that reward cli- nicians and scientists for theirresearch work. The funding environ-ment needs to foster a research oli-gopoly where there is both competi-tion and cooperation. It also needs tosupport research that challenges pre-vailing dogma.\" He hopes that European govern- ments will follow the UK and Franceand set up bodies that can take a strate-gic approach to national cancerresearch. The creation of the UKNational Cancer Research Institute in2001 opened the way for joint initia-tives by the main non-commercial fun-ders, which can address the researchinfrastructure, clinical research andbasic cancer research in a coordinatedmanner. Over the past few years, theproportion of UK patients enrolled inclinical trials has increased fromaround 3% to 11%. A similar approachin France led to the creation of theInstitut National de Cancer (INCa) aspart of the French Cancer Plan of2003. While Germany and theNetherlands have excellent cooperativegroups and some outstanding researchinstitutes, there are no other nationalstrategic cancer research bodies. Thisnot only hampers the organisation ofcancer research at a national level, butdeprives researchers of the voice theyneed to get governments and the EU totake cancer research more seriously. LISBON TRIUMPHANT ? There is more at stake here than whowill lead the world in genomics andbiotechnology for health. Investing -or failing to invest - in research has adirect effect on standards of care andthe survival of Europe's cancer patients. For instance, one conse-quence of pharmaceutical investmentmoving to the US is that Europe'spatients have to wait up to three yearsfor new cancer drugs to clear regula-tory hurdles. Conversely, Europeanpatients have benefited from earlyaccess to groundbreaking techniquespioneered in including adjuvantchemotherapy, breast conserving sur-gery, conformal radiotherapy andmeso-rectal excision in colon cancer. More generally, studies have shown time and again that patientstreated within clinical trials do better- whether they are in the experimen-tal or the control arm. Participating inclinical trials is also good for hospi-tals. It encourages clinical staff totake a more critical approach to theirwork, and it promotes multidiscipli-nary working and teamwork. The logistical demands can lead to lasting improvements in the way serv-ice delivery is organised. Indeed, join-ing an international clinical trial can bea very effective way to raise standards. However, arguments about the quality of patient care may not beenough to win debates over researchbudgets, because Europe's researchagenda is driven by economic ratherthan healthcare considerations. Andtraditionally, it is basic research thathas been relied upon to fuelEuropean growth, as biotechnologySMEs take discoveries made in thelabs and develop them into mar-ketable applications. However, as the MINDACT trial demonstrates, developing applicationsfor all the '-omics' requires work with patients, and that requires collabora-tion with hospitals and clinicians whorecruit, enrol and follow-up thepatients, and provide tissue and blood. This is research that Europe is uniquely equipped to undertake. Notonly is Europe strong in biomedicalresearch - the European MolecularBiology Laboratories in Heidelberg,Germany, and Cancer Research UKhave been rated two of the three topcentres in the world - but its publichealth systems offer an environmentsupportive of collaborative work that isunparalleled anywhere in the world. The capacity of Europe's medical researchers to communicate and col-laborate between hospital depart-ments, between treatment centres,and most challenging of all, betweenhospitals and laboratories is widelyrecognised and is a huge strength. Itexplains in part why, despite poor fund-ing and heavy regulation, the MIND-ACT trial is happening in Europe andnot in the US. This capacity givesEurope the potential to lead the worldin developing applications from therapid advances in molecular biology. By raising investment in cancer research closer to US levels, and aboveall by supporting clinical cancerresearchers, the EU and national gov-ernments would be playing to Europe'sstrengths, which will be essential if theEU is to stand a chance of winning theglobal race to become \"the most com-petitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world.\" Theywould also ensure that Europe'spatients gained access to the bestquality treatment in the world. Grand Round Failing to fund research directly affects standards of care and survival of Europe's cancer patientsMaster piece Finding the viral link: Hausen German virologist Harald zur Hausen was convinced by the early 1970s that the skin wart virus, human papilloma, was implicated in cervical cancer. Thirty years later we stand onthe threshold of a vaccine to prevent this major killer of women. Looking back, it couldhave happened earlier... Two pharmaceutical giants recently announced sensational results from clini-cal trials of vaccines that could prevent at least 70% of the 470,000 cases of cervical can-cer globally each year. Cervical cancer kills230,000 women a year, eight out of ten of themin developing countries, where it is the mostcommon cancer in women. In November 2004, the GlaxoSmithKline HPV vaccine study group delivered the resultsof a three-year study of a vaccine to protectagainst human papilloma virus (HPV). Theyreported in The Lancet 100% efficacy against persistent HPV 16 and 18 infection, the twotypes most closely associated with cervical can-cer. The team called for long-term follow-up toconfirm that this would prevent cervical cancer,but concluded \"our data provide compelling evi-dence that the HPV 16-18 vaccine is highlyefficacious\" and \"appeared to be safe and welltolerated\". Last month, at the 22nd International Papillomavirus Conference in Vancouver, a teamfrom Merck reported that their vaccine hadPeter McIntyre 32 CANCER WORLD JULY-AUGUST 2005shown 90% protection against HPV 6, 11, 16 and18. Alex Ferenczy, from McGill University, one ofthose involved in the Merck trial, said: \"These arevery exciting times for all of us in the field of cer-vical cancer prevention.\" His colleague PhilipDavies, head of the European Cervical CancerAssociation, went further. \"We have the means tovirtually eliminate cervical cancer.\" Amongst those present in Vancouver was Harald zur Hausen, from Heidelberg, who cansee the development of these vaccines as a vin-dication of his lifetime's work, and could be for-given for thinking that this could have happenedsome years earlier. It was zur Hausen who firstshowed that the papilloma virus is the most sig-nificant cause of cervical cancer, and he stuck tohis beliefs through years of confusion when therole of viruses was largely discounted. A LIFE'S WORK When Harald zur Hausen qualified as a doctorin 1960, the role of viruses in human cancerswas unknown. The first tumour-inducing virus had been dis-Master piece CANCER WORLD JULY-AUGUST 2005 33covered in 1911. Peyton Rous at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research in the US had iso-lated, from chickens, Rous sarcoma (retro)virus(RSV), which caused tumours in animals. Rouswent on to pioneer research into the rabbit papil-loma virus and its interactions with chemical car-cinogens in the 1930s, and received a Nobel Prizefor his work in 1966. In the early 1960s LudwigGross in New York demonstrated that retrovirusescaused tumours in mice and rats. zur Hausen's interest in infectious diseases and microbiology began when he was a studentdoctor in the 1950s. \"Maybe it is the difficulty ofthe problems that fascinated me. I was certainlyinterested initially in the infectious causes ofdiseases, rather than cancer.\" In 1961, his firstjob was at the Institute of Microbiology in D\u00fcsseldorf, where he spent three years trying toinduce a vaccinia (cowpox) virus to producechromosomal breaks in mouse cells. \"This virus and many others did something to the chromosomes, but nothing very charac-teristic. I didn't get very much help becausenobody else was interested in that question inthat place. They just left me to it. At a much tooearly stage I was very independent and withoutsufficient background in the field.\" He took courses in cytogenetics and molec- ular biology and taught himself to do lab work. \"Igot increasingly frustrated with my situation,\" herecalls. \"After much too long, I decided to lookfor a position somewhere else.\"\"I fished the letter outof the trash can,and wentto Philadelphia\" Master piece 34 CANCER WORLD JULY-AUGUST 2005Then came one of those random mutations that seem to influence most successful careers. TheSchool of Medicine at Pennsylvania Universitywrote to the Institute asking for a young GermanFellow to come and work in the US. TheDirector threw the letter away, but later men-tioned it to the young colleague with the interestin vaccines. zur Hausen did not hesitate. \"Ifished the letter out of the trash can, and wentto Philadelphia.\" There, renowned virologists Werner Henle and his wife Gertrude Henle were studying theEpstein-Barr virus, which had been observedthe previous year in the UK in cultured Burkitt'slymphoma cells, using an electronmicroscope.The virus induced changes in human chromo-somes and zur Hausen found the work interest-ing and intriguing. \"The Henles very gentlyshowed me what I did not know and I gained alot of technical expertise and experience.\" He used nucleic acid hybridisation to analyse DNA, and a fluorescent test developed by theHenles to detect the virus in a very few cells. The Philadelphia experience inspired him, but zur Hausen disputed the view, held by theHenles, that cultured Burkitt's lymphoma cellsmaintain a persistent infection, in which a fewinfected cells transmit the virus to a small num-ber of others. zur Hausen's view was influenced by lyso- genic bacteria, where the DNA of a bacterio-phage persists in all bacterial cells and maybecome activated to produce virus in an occa-sional cell. He speculated that Epstein-Barrvirus may persist in all Burkitt's lymphoma cellsbut become spontaneously activated only in avery limited number of cells. After three years, zur Hausen was offered his own laboratory at the Institute of Virology inW\u00fcrzburg, and he returned to Germany, deter-mined to put his theory to the test. After a longand difficult struggle he was eventually able toshow that \"non-virus-producing\" Burkitt's lym- phoma cells contained the Epstein-Barr DNA.\"We showed for the first time that viruses canpersist in human tumour cells as genomes, andprobably modify via the genomes these cells intotumour growth.\" It was not entirely unexpectedto find signs of the virus in lymphatic cells, sinceEpstein-Barr virus can cause mononucleosis, adisease that involves the lymph nodes. But, zurHausen and his colleagues were also able todemonstrate the virus in cells taken from anasopharyngeal tumour, an epithelial carcinoma. STEADY APPROACH By the end of the 1960s, zur Hausen had agrowing reputation. However, his careful, ration-al approach was not always heard in an age withhuge appetite for social and scientific advancesand in a field which seemed to induce wild opti-mism or profound scepticism. The youngest of four children, as a young child near Essen in the final years of the war,Harald had witnessed the destruction of thisindustrial part of Germany in daily bombingraids. For young people in post-war Germanylife was a serious business, and the zur Hausenchildren focused on their studies. Later, thehedonism of the late 1960s passed him by. \"Iwas in places in Germany that were very quiet orin Philadelphia. I was not so much part of the1960s. I was never a hippy,\" he recalls. Perhaps this helped him to keep his feet on the ground. At W\u00fcrzburg he became increasingly scepti- cal about claims that cervical cancer, which wasclearly sexually transmitted, was caused by theherpes simplex virus. In 1972, at the age of 36, he was appointed Professor of Virology at the University ofErlangen-Nuremberg in Bavaria, and set up aprogramme to examine other candidates, includ-ing the papilloma virus (HPV), responsible forThe audience listened to zur Hausen in stony silence, and dismissed his (now vindicated) resultsskin warts. This cannot be grown in tissue cul- tures and is difficult to isolate from clinicalspecimens such as genital warts, where it existsin very low particle concentrations. They were able to extract papilloma DNA from virus particles in the plantar wart (verruca).To zur Hausen's disappointment, these did notreact to the genital warts, implying that theviruses must be different. Nor did they react toother skin warts which contained the virus. Hewas discovering that papilloma is not a singlevirus but many. This heterogeneity was alsodemonstrated in Paris. Today, we know of 106different genotypes of papilloma virus and thereare probably more to come. At the time, much of the work on viral caus- es of cancer was being conducted in the US,under the Virus Cancer Program that had beenset up in 1964 by the National Cancer Institutewith a budget of US$50-60 million a year. Thiswork focused on retroviruses, following the dis-covery of the feline leukaemia virus in cats, thebovine leukaemia virus in cattle and the abilityof retroviruses to induce cancers in rats andprimates. This work eventually led to the discovery of oncogenes, but DNA virus research was neg-lected and poorly done. In 1973 the US National Cancer Advisory Board set up an investigation into the VirusCancer Program, which criticised its lack ofattention to DNA viruses, the fact that grantsMaster piece CANCER WORLD JULY-AUGUST 2005 35went to a limited number of laboratories, andthe way that researchers could vote money toeach other. The report was designed to refocusthe programme, but the message that went outto the public was that most research into virus-es and cancer was a waste of money. LOW POINT In 1974, zur Hausen went to an internationalconference in Florida to present results showingthat herpes simplex was not present in cervicalcancer. Shortly before he was due to speak, aresearcher from Chicago announced that he hadisolated 40% of the herpes simplex genome zur Hausen in stony silence, and dis-missed his (now vindicated) results as lackingsensitivity. It was the low point of his profes-sional life. In 1977 zur Hausen took the Chair at the Institute of Virology at Freiburg. His team wasable to extract and type virus material from agenital wart. Disappointingly, this type (HPV 6)was not present in cervical cancer cells. Soonafterwards the team isolated HPV 11, andfound Mathias then a stu-dent at the Institute, succeeded in cloning anew type, HPV 16, from a cervical cancer biop-sy. They were immediately able to show thatthis was present in about half of cervical cancerbiopsies. The Institute then isolated HPV 18,VIRAL CANCERS Viruses are strongly associated with about 15% of the global burden of cancer. Human papilloma virus with cervical cancer Hepatitis B&C with liver cancer Epstein-Barr virus with Burkitt's lymphoma and nasopharyngeal cancer and lymphomas human virus (HTLV1) with adult 8 (HHV-8) with Kaposi's sarcoma A viral aetiology is also suspected for other lymphatic cancers, leukaemias and some brain tumours. Othertumours are linked to bacterial and parasitic infection. Helicobacter pylori is a major cause of gastric can- cer, and parasitic liver flukes are responsible for a significant proportion of liver cancers in South East Asia.Globally, infections cause about 20% of cancers, but they are not evenly spread. In sub-Saharan Africa andparts of Southeast Asia about 40% of cancers are acquired through infections. In Western Europe and theUS it is more like 10%.Master piece 36 CANCER WORLD JULY-AUGUST 2005responsible for another 17%-20% of cervical cancers. In 1983 zur Hausen became director of the German Cancer Research Centre (Krebsfor-schungszentrum) at Heidelberg, and he gaveover much of his time to refocusing the way thatthe research was done, introducing peer review,and breaking down barriers between separateresearch institutes. He encouraged researchersto rely less on mouse models and to work moreclosely with clinicians. He launched clinical co-operation units with University hospitals and inthe last two years of his directorship, establishedthe foundation for a comprehensive cancer cen-tre with the University of Heidelberg. In 1984, more than 20 years ago, zur Hausen approached pharmaceutical companiesto work on developing a vaccine against HPV,which he was now convinced caused the vastmajority of cervical cancers. \"The viruses hadquite a simple structure and it should have beenpossible to produce something. But the compa-nies I approached did not believe that this wouldbe profitable and said there were more urgentproblems to be solved.\" In the mid-1980s the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 'democratised' genetic research,putting a quick and easy method for copyingDNA fragments within reach of biologists withlittle training in molecular biology or howto prevent cross-contamination of results.Laboratories all over the world began reportingHPV 16 in all kinds of tissue. LOST OPPORTUNITY These errors were enough to close the window ofopportunity to hunt for a vaccine. zur Hausensays: \"People became sceptical about the role ofpapilloma viruses in cancers. Pharmaceuticalcompanies were not interested in the story anymore, because this period created such confu-sion. I got a bit frustrated in this period and couldnot hide it. Cervical cancer is one of the major cancers worldwide, and it kills relatively youngwomen. If our original conviction that this virusmust be causative had been carried through, wewould have made an earlier start on a vaccine.\" By 1991, a number of epidemiological stud- ies confirmed that the papilloma virus wasindeed the causative agent for cervical cancer. In March 2003, now highly decorated and honoured, zur Hausen retired as director of theKrebsforschungszentrum. He continues to workat the centre where his wife Ethel-Michele deVilliers, a Professor of Virology, keeps a deposi-tory of all 106 known papilloma types. Thisallows him what he calls \"the privilege of friend-ly interference\". The Centre is still devoted to the aetiology of tumours, searching for viruses in leukaemiaand lymphoma, especially the 80% of cases ofHodgkin's disease that do not contain Epstein-Barr virus. zur Hausen is researching lym-phomas and leukaemia in children, for which aclean home and protected environment are riskfactors, while poor hygiene and day care are pro-tective. He believes that the intermittent infec-tions that children acquire in less protectedenvironments disrupt the build-up of the per-sistent infection which can lead to leukaemia. He is also interested in how the normal pro- tective mechanisms that the body has againstthe creation of 'immortalised' cancer cells areturned off one by one. The immune system, asystem to block viral oncogenes and the ability ofcytokines to render tumour cells harmless are allnormally highly efficient, and they have to beswitched off. It takes a long time for this to hap-pen, but tumours have plenty of time. Infectionwith papilloma virus often occurs between theages of 15 and 22. Cervical cancer is most com-mon between the ages of 40 to 45. This 20-yearperiod is sufficient for the genetic legacy of thevirus to disarm cell growth regulators one by one.In 1984, pharmaceutical companies turned down zur Hausen's request to work on an HPV vaccineMaster piece CANCER WORLD JULY-AUGUST 2005 37Clearly the virus is not the whole story. Because, while men too have the virus, rates of penilecancer are barely 5% of the rates of cervicalcancer. It is possible that oestrogen stimulatesvirus-producing cells and the 'immortalisation' ofcancer cells. UNANSWERED QUESTIONS Other factors such as smoking make cancersmore likely, but zur Hausen believes that thepapilloma virus will do it alone, given time.\"People say that the papilloma virus is a neces-sary but not a sufficient factor. We here aredeeply convinced that this statement is wrong;that the virus is necessary and in quite a numberof instances is also sufficient. Modifications inthe host cell genome can of course occur due tochemical or physical carcinogens, but they alsooccur due to the mutational activity of the viraloncoproteins themselves. Their long-termexpression leads to that accumulation of muta-tions which may lead to tumours. \"Provided you give it time and provided it is not cleared by the immune system, then the riskis high that a woman develops cancer. We seetoday that the previous strict separation betweenchemical, physical, and biological carcinogens isnonsense. There is a very close inter-relation-ship between these factors.\" A few scientists still report cervical cancer without papilloma virus. zur Hausen will believeit when he sees it. \"I frequently ask colleagues toprovide us with tumour samples which are intheir opinion negative and we have never gotany.\" Known HPV types account for about 90% of cervical cancers, and it is possible that othersare each responsible for a small part of the total.Some 'low-risk' HPV types, such as 6 and 11,very rarely can also cause other cancers. zur Hausen believes there will eventually be one vaccine covering almost all the high-riskpapilloma virus types. However, he fears that drug companies will price vaccines out of thereach of developing countries. Researchers atthe Krebsforschungszentrum continue to lookfor cheaper alternatives, especially one thatcould be delivered through a nasal spray ratherthan by injection. The papilloma vaccine is not the first to pro- tect against cancer. \"Hepatitis B in my opinion isthe first anticancer vaccine, although it wasdeveloped to prevent the symptoms of acuteHepatitis B,\" zur Hausen points out. Taiwan introduced a Hepatitis B vaccination programme in 1985. A study in 1995 showed adramatic reduction in Hepatitis B infectionamongst vaccinated children, and Taiwan isbeginning to see a reduced number of liver can-cers in teenage children. zur Hausen believes that vaccines could substantially reduce the risks of cervical cancerover the next 20 years, and that targetedchemotherapy will be effective for those whoalready have invasive cancer. He has spent his working life finding the evidence to show the role of papilloma virus,and although the road has been long and tortu-ous, he does not regret staying with it. \"Some of my colleagues think I am a bit stu- pid because I followed one thing for the wholeof my career - the infectious agents for carcino-gens. Many of those who worked with me in theearly days changed to do something else. Ibelieve that these chronic diseases demand apersistent involvement from the scientific side.\" zur Hausen is preparing a major text book on infectious causes of cancer. The story he hasbeen telling for 30 years is now broadly accept-ed as correct, but he believes there is moreexplaining to do. \"I am relatively quiet and notan immediately aggressive person,\" he says, \"butI think I can persuade people to do what isnecessary\". \"I believe that these chronic diseases demand a persistent involvement from the scientific side\"Impact Factor An international clinical trial has revealed that the additionof the chemotherapy agent temozolomide to radiation therapyincreases survival in patients suffer-ing from glioblastoma. And a com-panion laboratory study has offeredhope of even greater improvementsin survival in the future through iden-tification of a molecular change inthe tumour that allows prediction ofbenefit from the new treatment.The combined work, published thisMarch in the New England Journal of Medicine (vol 352, pp 987-996; 997- 1003), is being seen as a significantbreakthrough in medical research forpatients with glioblastoma. In an 42 CANCER WORLD JULY-AUGUST 2005accompanying editorial (pp 1036-1038), Lisa DeAngelis, Chair ofNeurology at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in NewYork City, hailed it as 'a new begin-ning' in chemotherapy for braintumours.Glioblastoma is the most commontype of primary malignant braintumour. It tends to occur in youngermen and women, with around 20,000new patients being diagnosed eachyear in the European Union. Patientshave an average life expectancy ofone year with the standard treatmentof surgical resection followed byradiotherapy. The trial aimed to findout whether this could be extendedwithout deleterious impact on quality of life through adding temozolomideto radiotherapy, both concomitantlyand as an adjuvant treatment.The clinical trial was performed forthe European Organisation forResearch and Treatment of Cancer(EORTC) Brain Tumour andRadiotherapy Groups and theNational Cancer Institute of CanadaClinical Trials Group. Almost 600patients from 85 centres who hadnewly diagnosed, histologically con-firmed randomlyassigned to receive radiotherapy temozolo-mide (see box). Results showed 26.5% survival at twoyears in those treated with the newcombined therapy, compared to only10.4% in those receiving radiotherapyalone. The dramatic improvement in medi-an survival at two years has surprisedeven the investigators.Martin van den Bent, a member ofthe research team based at theDaniel den Hoed Oncology Centre inRotterdam, the Netherlands, said:\"Temozolomide is new drugincreasingly being used with patientsundergoing radiotherapy, and thismakes it an interesting candidate to Alex MathiesonGlioblastoma: two studies herald a new start Surprise results of a temozolomide trial, and a new marker predicting who will benefit, offer hope for progress in the treatment of a highly aggressive brain tumour. THE TRIAL A total of 573 patients were randomly assigned to receive one of the following treatment options:Radiotherapy alone: focal irradiation in daily fractions of 2 Gy given five days per week for six weeks, to a total of 60 Gy Radiotherapy plus continuous daily temozolomide: 75 mg/m 2body-surface area per day, seven days per week from the first to the last day of radiotherapy, fol-lowed by six cycles of adjuvant temozolomide at a dose of 150-200 mg/m 2for five days during each 28-day cycle.

Thenew trial seems to have cast suchdoubts aside and is changing practicein a dramatic fashion in van denBent's home country. IMPROVED ACCESS \"Prior to the publication of thisstudy,\" van den Bent says, \"access toadjuvant chemotherapy for patientswith glioblastoma depended onwhich country they were treated in.Those in the Netherlands or UK wouldn't get it, while those inGermany, France and the US would.\"Since the study, most patients in theNetherlands with glioblastoma whoare candidates for treatment havebeen getting the combined modalitytreatment. It has become accepted asthe standard for these patients in avery short space of time.\"A key concern of any newchemotherapy treatment is that itshould not significantly worsenpatients' quality of life. The trial hasfound no such effects with the addi-tion of temozolomide.\"Analysis of the seven most impor-tant quality-of-life domains, such associal functioning, shows no differ-ence with the combined modalitytreatment,\" van den Bent explains.\"This was also the reported experi-ence of participating physicians - wewere really amazed by the ease withwhich patients tolerated the treat-ment. Many of the side-effects suf-fered, like fatigue, occurred as aresult of the radiotherapy, not thetemozolomide.\"Cost is another important element,and while van den Bent concedesthat the combined modality treat-ment is more expensive, it may be thecase that costs are shifted within thetreatment programme rather thandramatically increased overall. \"Some patients will now havechemotherapy early in their diseaseprocess rather than later, so theremay be a shift of costs from late toearly,\" he says.A health economic analysis is cur- rently being undertaken to establishthe impact of the new interventionon total treatment costs. PREDICTIVE MARKER The companion laboratory study, ledby Monika Hegi of the Laboratory ofTumour Biology and Genetics atUniversity Hospital, Lausanne, offersthe promise of even greater impact ofthe combined modality treatment inthe future.The study found didn't showed lessbenefit. Identifying this specific molecularchange is a complicated process, andno simple test is currently available.Van den Bent is hopeful, however,that following further trials, a testwill be ready for the market in late2005 or early 2006.In the meantime, he and his col-leagues are continuing their investi-gations, with the aim of further refin-ing the combined modality treatmentto improve survival even more.\"We are launching three new trialsthat will look to improve this now-standard treatment in several ways,\"he says. \"One is intensifying the adju-vant part of the treatment, another isprolonging it, and the last is to addother drugs to the combination.These trials are being initiated rightnow.\"Impact Factor Martin van den Bent: The combined treatment has become accepted as standard inglioblastoma in a very short space of time The dramatic improvement in median survival at two years has surprised even the investigatorsA healthy diet is simply a matter of good taste When cancer patients lose their appetite, serving food they like eating, at the time they want to eat it, is more effective than prescribing healthy meals that end up left on the plate. People who undergo treatment for can- cer often lose interest in food just whentheir body most needs to build itsresilience and strength. Dieticians rec-ommend that people with cancer eat small helpings and tasty snacks, and that theychoose high-fat foods which pack a lot of calo-ries into a small portion. Their advice may seem counterintuitive to those of us concerned about 'healthy eating' andobesity. While, in general, plenty of fresh fruitand vegetables are recommended for healthy liv-ing, cancer patients may need to change theirthinking, and focus on getting enough to eat.Amongst the advice, for example, in a RoyalMarsden guide for cancer patients 1is to add extra butter, margarine or oil to bread, potatoesand pasta, choose thick and creamy foods suchas full-fat yoghurt, eat fried food more often andavoid filling up on low-energy foods like vegeta-bles and fruit. When someone is admitted to hospital for surgery, chemotherapy or radiotherapy, thisadvice may be hard to follow. Hospitals areinstitutions, and institutions have regimes andPeter McIntyre timetables that rarely allow patients theflexibility to eat when they feel like, or to followa whim. Dieticians may prescribe delicious andnutritious diets, but hospital kitchens are notalways equipped to prepare them, and the timeit takes to process meal requests could meanthat the food reaches the patient after they havechanged their mind, or even left the hospital. The Netherlands Cancer Institute - Antoni Van Leeuwenhoek Hospital in Amsterdam(NKI-AVL) was no exception. Patients had toorder their meals two days in advance and mealswere served three times a day in the wards. Apatient who had undergone chemotherapy on aMonday had to work up some enthusiasm aboutwhat they would want for lunch the followingWednesday. When the specialist centre - its particular strengths are breast cancer, melanoma andgenetics - was given the green light in 1999 tobuild a new 180-bed hospital, they were toldthat they could not even have a full in-housekitchen, but only a 'cook-chill' system, whichwould be used to heat up meals that had beenpre-prepared off-site.

People with cancercome for in-patient treatment from all over theNetherlands, and staff felt it was important thattheir stay should be as pleasant an experience aspossible under the circumstances, with anatmosphere that would be as homely as possible. The in-patient design was for three floors, each housing three 'wards' of 16 beds in singleand double rooms. So it was decided to add arestaurant area on each floor which would offerhot meals and snacks throughout the day. Since the new hospital opened in September 2003, patients have been able to visit their near-est restaurant at any time from 7.00 in the morn-ing to 8.30 in the evening, and find a good choiceof hot food. They are encouraged to break out ofmeal times, and snack when they want. 'A lacarte' has replaced 'plat du jour'. And today nurs-es and dieticians are not as concerned about thecontent of meals as about patients eating enough. Petra Tuyp, head of facility services at the hospital, said: \"We used to share the opinionthat the cancer patients needed a special diet.But we had a lot of discussion with the dieti-cians and the doctors and we talked to the patients. We decided that it was more importantto eat something than to eat nothing. Caloriesare more important than vitamins.\" Since the hospital opened, surveys show that patients prefer chips to boiled potatoes, andif that is what gets them eating, then that is fine. And so while menus in the restaurant include salmon and spinach, patients can alsochoose burgers and chips. \"If you are ill, youmay choose what you think is the nicest tastiestfood rather than what you believe is the health-iest. If the patient likes fish and chips, for exam-ple, it is more important they eat this, than beserved with vegetables they will not eat.\" The new system costs more. There are three restaurants and they each have to be staffed.However, food costs have remained the sameand the number of meals served has risen by10-15%. Tuyp says that they were disappointedby this modest increase until they looked at howlittle they were throwing away every day. \"Underthe old system, we served every patient threemeals a day and we served a lot of food that wasnot eaten. Under the new system all the food weserve is eaten.\"Systems &Services 58 CANCER WORLD JULY-AUGUST 2005and nurses are now given more information so that they communicate better with patientsabout what they can eat, and call on nutritionassistants if a patient has a problem. WHATEVER YOU FANCY People receiving treatment and medication forcancer may be put off their food for many rea-sons. They may feel sick, and so not want friedfood. Others may have a sore mouth or throatdue to radiotherapy or chemotherapy, and soneed to choose soft and smooth foods that slipdown more easily, and not eat food that it is toohot. It is also possible for a cancer patient tohave an altered sense of taste, so that foods tastebland or the patient has an unpleasant taste inhis or her mouth. The beauty of the new system is that what- ever the dietician recommends, the patient willfind something suitable on the menu. In addition to regular patient surveys, research staff study the nutritional status ofpatients. However, it will never be possible toproduce hard evidence that the new eatingarrangements lead to better nutrition, especiallyas the average length of stay is gradually beingreduced from five to six down to two to threedays. Tuyp is content to know from surveys thatthe patients feel they have had a better experi-ence. \"There are many influences on your nutri-tional status, and it is difficult to say whetherthis makes a difference.\" The proof is in the eating, and in the fact that nobody wants to turn back the clock. Tuypsays: \"Changing the system is not under discus-sion at all. No one talks about going back towhat we had before. Everyone is convinced thatthe new system is better for the patients. Thedoctors and dieticians are very enthusiastic. Wehave done this project together in cooperationwith the dieticians, otherwise it would notwork.\"POPULAR The new system is popular with patients. \"Themost important thing is how the patients feel inhospital, and that they can stay in as normal anenvironment as possible. Our surveys tell us thatthey feel that the new system is very good andthat they feel very cared for.\" Not that the new system has been without problems. It took time for patients to adjust tothe \"eat as much as you like, when you like\"message. They tended to go to the restaurant only at traditional meal times. Now nutrition assistantsvisit the wards with lists that show patients whatthey could have. Patients are encouraged to takea snack mid-morning, and another at 4.00 pm,between lunch and supper. Even bed-bound patients get a better deal than before, as they are able to order their mealstwo hours rather than two days in advance. Theyare served their meals in their rooms, althoughnot at such flexible times as those who go to therestaurants. Relatives too miss out on the benefits. Because patients come from all over the country,the NKI-AVL has a guest house for relatives tostay. But they cannot eat with the patients in thehospital restaurants. Tuyp accepts that this is adrawback. \"We surveyed the patients and theysaid they would like their relatives to eat withthem, but because of budget restrictions, wecannot offer food to the relatives in the restau-rants, although on some occasions the nursesclose their eyes to it. \"If relatives ate there we would have to dou- ble the number of meals. Also, patients are notcharged for their meals. We are looking atwhether it is possible to set up a system tocharge relatives for meals.\" Another issue that required attention was an initial lack of communication between nutritionassistants and nurses. That has been addressedIf the patient likes fish and chips, it is better they eat this than be offered vegetables they will not eatImpact Factor Ameta-analysis has shown that using interferon in addition tochemotherapy leads to longer periods of remission and longer sur-vival in patients with follicular lym-phoma. The study published in theApril 1 issue of the Journal of Clinical Oncology (vol 23, pp 1-9) analysed data on 1,922 patients with follicularlymphoma, treated in the context of10 phase III trials that had producedconflicting results.Follicular lymphoma represents most for 35% of lym-phomas in North America and 22%worldwide. The median age at diag-nosis is 59 years, with the incidencebeing slightly higher in men than inwomen. \"The median survival is 9 or10 years, virtually irrespective of thetype of treatment,\" said AmaRohatiner, Professor of Haemato-Oncology at St Bartholomew'sHospital in London and the principalinvestigator of the study. \"With con-ventional therapy, response rates areabout 80%, but the illness virtuallyalways comes back.\"Treatments vary depending on ageand stage at presentation, from a'watch and wait' strategy in the initial 44 CANCER WORLD JULY-AUGUST 2005stages to multi-agent cells. YESTERDAY 'S DRUG ? \"Since the inception of the study, theuse of interferon -2 [IFN -2] for follicular lymphoma has largelysuperseded by these treat-ments\" said Rohatiner. Patients todayare rarely treated with IFN -2 since its clinical toxicity is not negligible. Itneeds to be given by subcutaneousinjection, and causes flu-like symp-toms and fatigue. \"But while thenewer drugs cause fewer side effects,show higher response rates andlonger durations of response, withthe exception of high-dose therapy,they have yet to show an improve-ment in survival,\" she added.The rationale for performing themeta-analysis came from a series of10 randomised studies, publishedbetween 1991 and 2001, evaluatingthe use of IFN -2 given in conjunc- tion with chemotherapy to newlydiagnosed patients. The problem wasthat considerable heterogeneity between studies led to conflictingresults, which made it difficult toreach a consensus. Discrepancies inthe results occurred even when onlystudies of similar design were consid-ered. In some studies IFN -2 was given concurrently with chemotherapy; inothers it was used as 'maintenance'therapy, whilst in others it was usedthroughout. Chemotherapy regimens varied inintensity, from ormitoxantrone-containing also differed. Additional variability occurredbecause some studies allowed theuse of radiotherapy to sites of bulkydisease at presentation, or to residualdisease.The meta-analysis was thereforeundertaken to clarify the effect ofinterferon on response, duration ofresponse and survival. Investigatorsfrom the original studies wereapproached and asked to provideupdated patient information, withonly patients diagnosed with follicularlymphoma being included in the final Janet FrickerFollicular lymphoma: side-lined drug excites new interest A study showing that follicular lymphoma patients benefit from adding interferon to standard chemotherapy has opened up new avenues for research.CANCER WORLD JULY-AUGUST 2005 45analysis. Chemotherapy regimens were with studies utilisingrelatively intensive'.Overall, the study found that IFN - 2, when given in addition to conven-tional chemotherapy as part of initialtherapy in newly diagnosed patientswith follicular lymphoma, prolongsremission duration and survival, butdoes not result in any improvement in response rate. Exploring these dif-ferences in greater detail, the investi-gators found that interferonincreased survival in patients inwhom the drug was given in conjunc-tion with relatively intensivechemotherapy, at a dose of at least 36million units/month.The authors acknowledge that, withthe development of alternative treat-ments, it is difficult to know \"howbest to incorporate this informationinto the algorithm of rituximab didn't exist, this paper would havebeen enough to convince me to useinterferon, but now it's probably a bitlate to be helpful,\" he said.But the study is valuable in that itpoints the way to future research.\"We know that rituximab andchemotherapy is better thanchemotherapy alone, and from thisstudy that interferon and chemother-apy is better than chemotherapyalone, so perhaps we should now beinvestigating whether the combina-tion of chemotherapy, interferon andretuximab in follicular lymphomawould be even better still,\" he said.Impact Factor Interferon increased survival in patients when given together with fairly intensive chemotherapyE.coli synthesisinghuman interferon CNRI / SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY "}
