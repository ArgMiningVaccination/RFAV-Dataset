First a mother tincture is made from the original substance and pure alcohol. Then a drop of this mixture is placed in a measured amount of water and this mixture is sucussed. Sucussion is a process by which the mixture is given a measured amount of vigorous shaking. This process is then repeated many times depending on the desired potency of the medicine. It seems from some recent scientific studies that this process imparts an energetic imprint of the original substance to the water molecules. Storing your Homeopathic medicines So how can you store you homeopathic medicines? Because they are energetic medicines they need to be stored carefully. If you follow these guidelines below your remedies will last several years which makes them very good value for money! - Store them in a cool place such as a drawer or cupboard. The ideal temperature range should be between 10-20C - The medicines should be away from strong sunlight but having said this, it is best to have your bumps and bruises homeopathic first aid kit in your hot car to hand, when your kids fall over in the park then to have it cool at home! - Do not keep them next to equipment that emits a strong electromagnetic field such as your computer, hands free home phone or mobile phone. - Keep them away from strong smells such as essential oils and things you might use if you have a cold such as eucalyptus rubs or 'tiger' balms. - Store all your remedies in a place together so that when you need a certain remedy, you can find it! - Airport X-rays: In an ideal world your homeopathic kit should not be x-rayed at airport security. If you are ravelling in the Australia or the UK it is acceptable for you to hand your kit or medicines to the security people and they will check them by hand rather than put them through x-ray. If you are travelling in the US then just accept that with the current security measures your remedies will have to be x-rayed along with everything else in your bag! On that basis I put them in my suitcase. Taking Homeopathic Medicines Homeopathic medicines are usually dispensed in one of five forms: - A powder (usually used for a single dose) - Pillules (hard sugar pills) - Soft pillules (dissolve easily in the mouth) - Liquids (usually in a bottle with a pipette or dropper) - Cream (such as Arnica or Calendula cream) When you take your remedy it is important to follow these guidelines: - Take your remedy in a clean mouth. This is important because the remedy is absorbed through the delicate lining of your mouth rather than in your stomach. What we mean by a 'clean' mouth is one that hasn't just been eating some food! Take your remedy at least 15mins after or before any food or drinks (although water can be taken at any time.) - Do not handle the pillules directly as the remedy is often applied to the outside of the pillules and when you touch them, most of the remedy will end up on your fingers and not in your mouth! The easiest way to dispense a pillule is to tip one into the lid of the bottle and use that to tip it into your mouth. - Once the pillule is in your mouth let it dissolve by keeping it under your tongue. In the case of children who might crunch the pillules, don't worry as it is highly likely that the remedy will have been absorbed already. It is hard for them to resist! - After taking a remedy, wait 15 minutes before cleaning your teeth as this is the same effect as eating something. Other factors to be aware of when taking homeopathic medicines Some homeopaths prefer their patients to avoid mint/spearmint while under homeopathic treatment so they recommend using a non-mint toothpaste. Personally, I feel that there are very few remedies and people under treatment that will be affected by this and therefore I do not advise this precaution. The same can be often said by homeopaths about coffee. My feeling is that unless you are a particularly heavy coffee drinker then it is ok to drink coffee while on your homeopathic treatment.
