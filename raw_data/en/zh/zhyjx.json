In addition, the word list contained herein' should beof interest to etymologists as they will note the large'number of reflexes or words re-lated to other Philippine dialects and languages. ...Neither this dictionary nor its authors purport to have gathered every word in theAklanon language, but a major number are certainly represented. Native Speakers whoamay browse through this book will be surprised at seeing 1.very large representation ofEnglish and Spanish words. Some may be,tempteito criticize their presence here: How-ever, one need only eavesdrop on any conversationof local people--be .it formal orinformal--and hear for himself the overwhelming number of borrowed terms in actualUse. The authors have operates on the principle that the sounds floating in,Aldanoti air..make up the total part and parcel of Aklanon sp ech,and should be represented here.For those who will be startled to see borrowed fOreign or vulgar word's we ask their.b forbearance and understanding in this matter. - 1 -PROF.

THE ENTRIES. , Many readers may well be 'surprised' at the spelling of some of thfilent;ies.tn/thjs dictionary.Since Aklanon is a language where the traditional spelling of wordS)/ery,very elotiely matches the pronullciation.of the words, the authors have chosen to re-present even foreign words with ,a native spelling, There is a long-standing tradition of such a procedure inwritten 'language.Even modern English simplify itself nas freely adopted the English \"evacuate\" into the more native and commonly accepted \"bakwit \", \"vulcanize\" into \"pabulkit\"; the Spanish the Insti- tute of the National Language encourages and practices such in the development ofFilipino,- Aklanons have trprecedent for their own dialect. Hence, although some . spellings may seem ridiculous or humorous at the present time, they can eventually be expected to be popular, vernacularized words, such as\"ice cream\"./ayskrim/\"jeep\"/dyip/\"hollow block\"haloblak/.-'nurse\"/nars/\"featherduster\"/pederdas/o\"floorwax\"/plorwaks/The authors have also taken a step forward in spelling all the truly Aklanon 'orFilipino names of towns and places in the correct vernacular spelling, retaining onlythe Spanish and American names in the spelling of the original language. It is urgedthat the municipal councils of each town adopt such spellings to insure uniformity and conventionality throughout the province, as inOLD VERSIONCORRECTED SPELLINGLibacaoLibakaw'CidivoKalibo.DaguitanDagitanMalinaoMalthaw.LaguinbannaEaginghanwa.H'owever, \"fines of towns and places that are,not native Aklanon words should retain . the spelling of the original foreign language; such as in \"New Washington\", \"Numancia\",\"ibajay\" or \"Roxas City\".Traditional Aklanon spelling does not for three symbols which linguists wouldexpept in a phonological transcription. We account for them by using the following symjDols along with the traditional Aklanon- Final pronounced, but traditionally Anspelled./h/ is written inas (h), as in:srmba(h),tinda(h),daed.(h)to show that the /h/ sound will appear when isin:affixed, been spelledwith the hyphen \"-\" by Altlanons when in the in: 8i31-0, gae-om, an-om, bo-bo, us-us, ba-ba,.! However, it unspelled at the end of a word, except-for a few who used the grave accent IV to signal its presence.

Since, stress is most im-portant in distinguishing the meaning of words, the authors have endeavored to indicate,stress as often as possible with the acute accent Certain stress pairswill showthe importance of suchiaSymliol in, TO UNDERSTAND AND USE THIS DICTIONARYThis dictionary is a list of the basic root words or word bases of the Aklanon dia-lect (considered a language by linguists). If one only wishes to get the general mean-ing of words it should be relatively simple to use. However, if the reader wishes toreap the full fruit of all the inforniation contained herein, such as how particular rootbare used, or how they can grow into other parts of speech, Ave urge him to master thegrammatical explanations which will follow this section.The authors have endeavored to present the following information in this .dictionary:1.The ROOT WORD given first in broad or expapded type, followed.thereafter by the derived from ENGLISHborrowed or derived from TAGALpGborrowed or derived from CHINESEborrowed or derived from HILIGAYNONbOrrowed or derived from JAPANESEused in the vicinity of LIBAKAWused bymountain or remote peoplesrused in the vicinity old or \"deep\" AlcianOn, cso ...,panghingaean mixed -areas particUlar OF THE WORD ifilt is not part of theJ ..commonly accepted speech medium fat the general public, such as: *.[FE]a Filipino English translation,', not ,generally known-orused by native speakers of English. \\ _ A -..__t [AE]anAmeiican English tranlatiiin, norielerally-tknown or used speakers.

Howev in those cases where English itself would use' a different form than the causate, the Aklanon causative construction is.presented fn kaon (eat) has wregular causative is not \"let eat\" but rather feed\". Sincee English evidences such a drastic change away from the Aklanon \"Rom, an try is made to reveal such a phe- nomenon. The same can be said for the an no is known to the authors toequivalently represent the Aklano term.

Thep are thebasic units of meaning from which most other meaningful words grow--that's why they,arecalled '!roots'',because other words grow from them-. In English, root words.are not always very easy to locate. It is difficult, for example, to isolate the root in:\"food, feed, fed, feast\",. yet, there is something baste to each. In Aklanon, on the OtheJhand; roots axe always prettyaasy to find. There are, first' of all, SIMPLE ROOTS,such as bilin which ilways be found whole. But there also are, secondly, REDUCED ROOTS, Whichare root words thit undergo -some sort of change from the simple root .The first step towards understanding what chEinges are taking place ci pendb on knowing the different types of affixation the root word can undergo in Akl mon. 4. 4AFFIXES are syllables attached to the root word. 'They can be attar hed tope root in just about any place: beginning - PREFIXES, middle - including REDUPLICATIONS, or end - 'SUFFIXES. *Affixes make it pdssible for ,t root word to get newer, niorde)q)anded or exparidable meanings. They give form, 'function and even meaning (beyond the root wores-basic meaning). One current theory maintains that Philippine languages have root words which ,are not members of any particular part of speech; rather, they are roots which can grow into or be used as.parts of . speech within the 'sentence. Alone; they have meaning, but not hinction. There is a good deal of truth in this theory, though more research need be undertaken to see how well it would describe Aklanon and other Philippine languages.Let us discuss the various affixes one by one:[pfx)(I) PREFIXES stand Wore the root word. They are of two sorts--standirsi firkins, which are always the very first part of the word:na---.natapuenag---nagbasa(h)pag---pagkaonma - --maadtoand postpositive prefixes, which oome immediately before the root word, but (can) follow the standard prefix: nilcanagakahueog)pasginapaadto]pangnagpangasawa-. - [ifx](2) INFIXES are put into the root word, usually after the first.consowmt words that seem, to begin with vowels actually have an unwritten glottal stop for-tbe first con- sonant]:-in --binakaegbitimok= '(red)(3) REDUPLICATIONS the repetition of the first part of the root word. Alclanon has two types of ed4plicatfon--repetition of thefirst consonant and the first ,vowel of the root word which is:then some consonant (usually the fricative \"e\" or a nasal) and therepetition of the first vowel of the root word or N41/ ] which is then go about the businets of using root words in speech, we find them growingwith regard to, both meaning, and function. A root word and all of its'subsequeilt possi-bilities of affixation are what go into the making up of a word's total range, or, moreaccurately, WORD RANGE. The word range of any given root is the root word itselfand all of its derivations.- One of the most productiveroots in Aidanonis that oftawo(h) which indeed has a large range:FOR/4PART when we ga from a simple root to various members, of its word rangethere is a basic change in sound: a vowel may be droppil or changed, consonants maybe ewitched around or changed:- Such changes will be described and di;cussed in alater section (see Unit VII, \"THE CASE OF THE MISSING LINKS\").For a native speaker, the problem of finding a root word is simplified in that hecan- derive it from the sense of the longet forniand his own personal experience will,the dialect.For a foreign learner, understanding the prOblenas of the sound changesas discussed in Unit VIE will be crucial.- 9 I .13 71 'IP.0.7. SV. AN OUTLINE OF AXLANON'S SIX BASIC GRAMMATICAL FUNCTIONS1. THE TOPIC (OR FOCAL POINT) of Aklanon sentences is that element of thesentence which the speaker fs talking about; emphasizing, or which he considers themost important. Poi example, storewitjt some moneyan Aklanon speaker can discuss or emphasize any one of those elementts [Although itis unlikely that any single sentence would include all of the given: elements of thatsituation].Using, -then, the topic marker ro [which money...)depending on what one would want to talk about in the sentence. Of course, . depending on what one makes the topic of the sentence, the grammar will change, particularilythe verb form; however; we will discuss that lalerin Section 6 under VERB CENTERSAND FOCUS.For the present, we only need note that the Aklanon sentence usually has, a particular topic position and/or topic function. -There are, however, four possible terms for the Aklanon topics, depending onwhether the topic is: .1,1. A COMMON NOUN, which is then marked by bought ro kahoy. / The tree is tall.Mande ro mot6r. / The motorbike is sive.1, 2. THE NAME OF A PERSON OR A PET, which is then marked by si [singular]or sanday / say [plural]. .. ,[Tm]Nagbaide si Maria it dulsi. / Mary bought [some] candy.Nag-u11,,.sanday Juan. / John (and his companions) went home.Maaeam sanclayarlos ag Pedro. / Carl and Peter are smart.1, 8. A PRONOUN, which then would be any TOPIC gift bought for anay ak6.First' will sing.AWt 4 4,; 1 Ia1/44r DEMONSTRATIVE, which TOPIC ratio.(T/dem)'Nano this?2. THE PREDICATE of Aklanon sentences is that element of the sentence whichthe speaker is giving as \"news\" or, details about what the'topic is or is doing. The pre., &este could be an adjective (G.169-180b as in:(adj]Dimot si Antonio. / Anthony is miserly.Bata': pa ako,/ I am still young.Tawohon kuno ro kah9y ngara. / This tree is said to be inhabited.Makadueuyog ro tukar. / The music was soperific.Matambok sanday Agnes. / Agnes (and the others), are fat.or a verb (G. 55-98), as in:[RV]Itiagaagto ako ro buedng? / Did'you really drink the medicine'?which we shall discuss in more detail in Section 6.o. 3. THE ASSOCIATE IS a technical term used to describe several types of con- structions, namely: .(a) constructions 'showing possesdion or ro bintana' ku baedjr. / The windo1v of the house is large. ..,(b)\". 'constructions describing the doer of an action in sentences or clauses where the doer is not the topic jthat is, stressed qr emphasized]: ,.(Al)..Ro tinapay ginbakde Inangkit ro ayam ku 'curing. /*The dog by the mai.,(a) constructions describing the instrument pf an action in sentences or clauses where the instrument is not the topic: ._.. ,Pinatdy ro sawg -for the baby with the money that Momma left-behind.English has equivalents for the possessive use of the associate, but there is no exact or idiomatic equivalent which capturgs the .,,exact-sense elle Aklanon idiom with =- emphasized actors or instruments. -s\" \"s-,4,......,sA'Just as for the topic position, there are four possible forms for Aklanon associates, h-depending on whether the associate is:,..,3,1.

Aklanon exhibits a curious phe-nomenon in ththeree ao distinct object markers or forms for persons or pronouns,only for comm .n nouns. The object marker for a COMMON NOUN is ,it.agbakae isi David it singsing. / David bought a ring.[ Om]a' ak6 it I candoithle forthe object marker, particularilywith object' -[Am]Nagbakie ku gatas ngaron? / Have you drunk that \\ 4- 12 -IeIA 1.00..,\" 0, rt\" , .14As mentioned, persons and pronouns cannot be made the direct receivers of an action;'instead of usingki object forin, an indirect object form [REFERENT] is used.The object marker also has an ADVERBIAL USE by joining what would normally bean adjective to the verb, as in the following examples: .[ady]kaon it mayad. well.Kanta it mabaskog. 7 SingNakahambae imaw it mabakas. / He speaks quickly. ,,The object marker also has a PARENTHETICAL USE, particularly with 'thebasic pronoun forms [G.168]: ...if.(par)Indi' tang magpati./ I won't to kimo.I. You are so sloW.5. THE REFERENT is a technical term used to-describe any of several types ofconstructions,; namely: .. '1(a)constructions -showing the indirect somethingis. done]:.SGinta6 nana kimo *on nga ginahambae sa mga ungd.'. / tosay to the children.Ginpadaed. ron sa akong ginikanan. / That was sent to my parents.(b)constructions showing the beneficiary of an action, (person for whom something isdone]:Para sa makasasaea' ro pagkonfesd.r. / anang ungd.'. / He bought candy forlifs child.(c)ioiistruetions showing the place or location of an action:[loc]Naglarga sanda sa Manila'. / They left for Manila. ... Mauli' imaw sa Kalibo. / He will return to Kalibo.Inaywan donnakon sa baedy. / I left that at home.The dearest equivalent td the klanon Referent in English is a good part of the pre- positional system (\"at; oh', by, in, to, for\"). However, where the English prepositions' are exact, the Visayan referent is vague. 'For exakple, \"at home, in the to house, into the house\" would all be \"sa baggy\" in e.e non.Aswith the topic and associate, there are four possible forms for the Akianon re-.404ferents,Vepending on whether She referent is: ,5,1. A COMMON NOUN, which is then marked by sa .e,1Ginbakle ko ra sa tindahan. / I bought this at the market.Nakahambae eon ak6 sa maestro. / I already spoke to the teacher.aDaeha ron para. sa manghod mo; / Carry that for your younger brother.5,2.

VERBAL CENTERS are probably the most important aspect of Aidanen gram-mar. For one rea`son, because Aldanon verbs are so very different from those of Eng-lish or any Western language.' For =Other, because verbs are the most important partof any utterance. One cannot speak long in sedonces which quite different from those of English. .In Englishwe are used to thinking of `three attributes in VOICEwhichteachers usuallyd\\vide into:active:\"I the bread was bought by me.\"In Aklanon, however, onemust get used to thinking ofdifferent attributes in verbs:(1) ASPECTwhich tellswhe4ther an action has begun or riot, orwhether it got finished or not, ariasnot always with some clear di-vision into present, past orfuture.(2) MODE -4 whether an action isintentional, accidental or obligatory:intentional:\"I tore up the paper.\"accidental:\"The paper [accidentally] got torn.\"obligatory:\"Tear up the paper. \" .[command forin](3) FOCUSwhich is an idiom of the language whereby one cantalk about or stress any basic sentence element; associate,\"object,actor, or referent. A,Let us take up a point by.point discussion of each of these verbal elements.. A. ASPECT IN AKLANON Is not intended to tell time, but rather to indicate the degreeto which an action is completed. It is often coincidental thatVisayan aspect forms semito match English tense forms, though there are also some striking differe3Mg.Forexample, nao-- shows that an action was begun and completed; in both logic and meaningit parallels the simple English past tense: nagbakae / bought.However, the nags -. for= 'denotes that an action was begun but was not completed:' Sometimes it parallels the Eng=lish present progressive or simple present 'tense: nagabakbe / is buying, buys; but itcan ak6 it tinapay. / Whenhe arrived it the market, I was buying bread.It could also be used to signify a continuing action in future time, as in:Makahuhuya' kon urnabot imaw ag nagakaon kaml. / It would be soembarrassing dire were to arrive and we would be eating.:tual time when Because of these differences, it is necessary to discuss the Aklanonfors one by f.- 15 - ON, it pO one and give all their cOnnptations and denotations in English. Please bear wit us if we use unfamiliar terminology [like \"imperfective\" or \"conditioned \"] becausee forms themselves are unfamiliar and represent brand new elements of grammar, not all aken in English grammars. It is hoped that the expiples will clarify techni-( IMPERFECTIVE [nags - -, shows that an action has begun but that it-is not yet completed. The actual time of the action is not clear in .e verb itself, since it usually depends on other time indicators in the -clause or sente ce. If no other time indicator occurs, then the imperfective can,be taken to describe an ac- r;tioa in the present. The imperfective has three connotations in'English:\\-/ A1,1. a PRESENT or CURRENT' ere marketing now. Nagapallabas am on my 'Theyare still eating.Al,atIABITUALACTIONNagapangisdai kamo fish day?

These fpurpreviously discussed aspectts refer to positive statements, that is,statements of fact that do not.have any negatitie,particlfs in them. Whenever a neg- ativegets into an Aklaiton sentence, the grammar changes considerably, particularily in the object focuses.It is important to look at the three different types of negativeor conditioned aspects used with indil and owd'.A, 5. THE PRESENT CONDITIONED OR NEGAGTE,,FORM gi---#1 is used when certain question parEicles,[such thenegative own' 'occur , in the gaballgyat gibakea'rzsirgsing, ginatan-ax 'ean4. / I'm not buying the ring, I'm just lOolang at, it..StIn nimo:gieabhi-ro umov. / Where do you wash .

MODE is the second basic attribute of Aklanon verbs. Whereas mode is usuallyIshown in English. by the \"helping verbs\" [can; should, shall, will, may] Visayare.yerbs,ihave mode right in the very affixes attached to the root word.

THE SIMPLE MODE states.the simple fact or occurrence pf an action, 5w\"--/wietherit od6urred or did not occur. , All the nine aspects just discussed are in the .simple mode.

Any adtion is not 'merely related to itself in terms of thevocabulary used to cjesciibe it-,For example, kalon or eat can never haptien by itself.the process of eating happens:at a certain TIME: perhaps in the morning (then we haye 'the special term \"breakfast\"or \"panialaw\" to describe it),, evening (\"supper\" qr \"lhapoti\"). Becauseall-actions-happen in time something inevery sentence must indicate time. We have seen how Aldan ASPECT can handle time situations to some degreS, riat7tieu laxly with the help of otheitime words.in a PLACE QR LOCATION: perhaps we eat in ;the dintit room or the kitchen, at a picnic, or at the beach. The place of an action.is not always'said, but it is alwais un- derstood. .slt - with a definite ACTOR: perhaps you or I am eating, per- haps Jose or Maria, or maybe a man or a child or a kitten. We have seen how Aklanon has pronouns, special markers, for common nouns or the names of persons or pets. - with a definite OBJECT: perhaps rice, meat, vegetables,bread or candy.- with shine sort of INSTRUMENT: one eatswith one's hands,or else with a spoon or fork; we also use plates and boivls.Still other verbs have other SITUATIONAL .DETAII.S, expressed or implied, such as indirect objects, beneficiaries, causes, agents, causers and so on. 4,\"' In Aklanon; the speaker may discuss any one of the situational details he wishes to. The Mont of the dialect_thert forces him to choose any one of four basic focuses: he must make the situational detail he so chfr,kliaes-the toPic of the sentence--then the verb and all the other sentence elements.rausree with it.This is precisely the whole idea of FOCUS.Focus is an agree en,t relationship which consists of a verb form and related function-marked phrases that reveal- the-emphasis patterns of the speaker.It is an agreement relationship-because the entire construction is bound together in grammatical-reiltionship to itself, independent of any other forms outside of thenstrtfclion,. and the various elements of the construction are tightly tied to- gether.The elements of the VERBAL CENTER in Aklanon areuniversally: 1.a topic phrasewhich could be any situational role; 2. a verbwith itstroper focus affixes depending on the situational role represented in the topic phrise;3. other related associate, object or referent phrases-marked according' to the situational roles they represent, giving one or more of the situational details.141;.1177/:- Pay'your debt.

THE ACTOR FOCUS stresses or make the actor or doer Of the action,the focal point of the sentence.

DISTRIBUTIVE VERBS (G.106-08]DVA. 3,0.Most verb roots can be made into n distributive by the simple ad- -dition of the jpang- prepositive prefix (with accompanying consonantreduction).
