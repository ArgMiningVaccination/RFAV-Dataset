If you struggle with toxins or skin issues these natural recipes are a simple, easy, and inexpensive way to boost health. I'm always up for a warm bath, and these natural add-ons help improve health while you relax. A good detox bath will also tend to make you tired so I suggest doing them as [part of your bedtime routine.](https://wellnessmama.com/health/improve-sleep-naturally/) Natural Detox Bath Recipes You may have heard of an Epsom bath (and that is our base recipe here), but what about a clay bath, vinegar bath, or even a mustard bath?! These are all natural ingredients, available in most of our kitchens or pantries, that can boost the circulatory and olfactory senses, stimulating relaxation and building up magnesium stores. You only need a few simple ingredients to make some or all of these detox bath recipes: - Epsom salt - apple cider vinegar - baking soda - bentonite clay (one more specialized ingredient that has [lots of other purposes](https://wellnessmama.com/health/bentonite-clay/), so consider stocking up!) - mustard powder or ginger powder - essential oils (mix with powder or salt rather than directly to the bath) These recipes are also safe and soothing for kids too! (But [choose your essential oils wisely](https://wellnessmama.com/remedies/essential-oils-risks/).) Basic Epsom Salt Detox Bath Recipe Here's my basic detox bath recipe. Find the other variations below. Mix and match, or find your favorite! Salt Detox Bath Recipe Yield Equipment Materials - 2 cups water - \u00bc cup [sea salt](https://wellnessmama.com/go/salt/)(or Himalayan vinegar](https://www.amazon.com/Bragg-Organic-Unfiltered-Apple-Vinegar/dp/B001ID6MIC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?th=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=wellnessmama-20&linkId=b704273ff76ef3eb4974a15cb64a4907) - 10 drops [essential oils](https://wellnessmama.com/go/essential-oils/)(optional, I use peppermint or lavender) Instructions - In a small pan, bring 2 cups of water to a boil. - Pour the water into a quart-size mason jar. - Stir in the sea salt, Epsom salt, and baking soda. - Fill the bathtub with warm/hot water. - Add the apple cider vinegar. - Pour the salt mixture in and add essential oils if using. - Soak in the bath for 30 minutes or as long as desired. Notes Clay Detox Bath Recipe - \u00bd Dissolve the Epsom salts in a warm/hot bath and add essential oils if desired. For the clay there are two options: - Vigorously mix the clay into a small amount of water until the clumps are mostly dissolved. Do not use metal for this! I mix with a plastic spoon in a glass jar. Add the clay mix to the bath and soak for at least 20 minutes. - Mix that clay with a small amount of water to make a paste. Stand in the tub full of water and rub the clay mix all over your body to create a skin mask and let dry for 5 minutes before sitting down. This provides direct contact with the skin and effectively pulls toxins from the skin. Soak in bath at least 20 minutes or as long as desired. While soaking, use a wash cloth to scrub any remaining clay off the skin. This bath is great for removing a lot of toxins as the clay binds to heavy metals and the Epsom salts help pull a variety of toxins from the body while replenishing magnesium levels. Oxygen Detox Bath Recipe This bath is especially helpful during illness as the ginger helps clear congestion or alleviate body aches. It can also be helpful for allergies or skin irritation. - 2 cups (or more) [hydrogen peroxide](https://www.amazon.com/Essential-Oxygen-Hydrogen-Peroxide-Grade/dp/B01AW1HYIC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?tag=wellnessmama-20) - 1 TBSP dried [ground ginger](https://www.amazon.com/Organic-Ground-Anthonys-Gluten-Free-Non-GMO/dp/B019ZW9XBA/ref=as_li_ss_tl?tag=wellnessmama-20) Oxygen Detox Bath Instructions - Fill the tub with warm/hot water and add the hydrogen peroxide and dried ginger. - Soak in tub for 30 minutes or as long as desired. Vinegar Detox Bath Recipe This is an excellent bath for soothing skin problems since vinegar balances the skin's pH. While I don't love the smell of vinegar, if anyone in the family has sunburn, eczema, dandruff, or dry itchy skin we take a vinegar bath. [Apple cider vinegar has a whole host of benefits](https://wellnessmama.com/health/apple-cider-vinegar-uses/), and I find it helps not only my skin but leaves me with soft skin and shiny hair as well. Vinegar Bath Instructions - Once or twice a week, I fill a tub with warm to hot water and add 1-2 cups of [apple cider vinegar](https://www.amazon.com/Bragg-Organic-Unfiltered-Apple-Vinegar/dp/B001ID6MIC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?tag=wellnessmama-20). - I soak for 20-30 minutes, using a washcloth to clean my face and making sure to get my hair wet as well. After bathing, I rinse off in a cool shower, though some sources recommend letting the vinegar water dry on the skin. Mustard Detox Bath Recipe I know, I've lost my mind right? If it helps, I'm talking about organic mustard powder, not the yellow stuff in a bottle! Ancient cultures often used this spice in preparations to soothe colds, flus, and sore muscles, thanks to its circulation-stimulating properties. Magnesium and essential oils make this bath both detoxifying and aromatic. Mustard Bath Instructions I use [this recipe](https://mommypotamus.com/mustard-bath/) which uses [organic mustard powder](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004NR94TO/ref=as_li_ss_tl?tag=wellnessmama-20), Epsom salts, and a mix of essential oils. Additional Detox Bath Notes - The warmer the water, the more powerful the detox effect will be. - If you have chlorine and fluoride in your water, I recommend adding a few tablespoons of [bentonite clay](https://wellnessmama.com/go/bentonite/)to any of these baths to help absorb the chemicals so they aren't absorbed into the skin. Here are [some other ways to reduce chemicals in bath water](https://wellnessmama.com/natural-home/reduce-bath-water-chemicals/)as well. - Any of these natural ingredients can be used alone or in combination for a cleansing effect. - All recipes can be doubled or tripled but this will increase the detox effect.
