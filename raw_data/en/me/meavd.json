The monotherapy of medicine may not adequate for the pain management of CPP and multidisciplinary approaches have been more recommended. The aim of this study is to evaluate the pain management efficacy of acupuncture compared with a control group on CPP. The articles of randomized controlled trial on CPP in PubMed and Embase databases were screened between January 2011 and September 2022 without language restriction to evaluate the treatment efficacy of acupuncture. The visual analogue scale/numerical rating scale (VAS/NRS) and total pain scores of National Institutes of Health\u2014chronic prostatitis symptom index (NIH-CPSI) were served as outcome variables. Post-intervention mean scores were extracted and pooled for meta-analysis. Seventeen studies including 1455 patients were selected for meta-analysis. Both total pain scores of NIH-CPSI and VAS/NAS data revealed significant lower pain level in the acupuncture group than in the control group. Moreover, monotherapy with acupuncture revealed a significantly lower pain level than in the control group in both total pain scores of NIH-CPSI and VAS/NRS. These results indicated that acupuncture may have beneficial effects on pain management for CPP, even when administrated as a monotherapy.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2023-03-11", "cleaned_text": "Analgesic Efficacy of Acupuncture on Chronic Pelvic Pain: A Systemic Review and Meta-Analysis Study [https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare11060830](https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare11060830) Abstract: 1. Introduction [1](#B1-healthcare-11-00830)]. The prevalence rate of CPP varies around the world. A previous study from the World Health Organization reported that the prevalence rates of non-cyclic CPP ranged from 2.1% to 24%, of cyclic CPP (associated with dysmenorrhea) ranged from 16.8% to 81%, and of intermitted CPP (associated with dyspareunia) ranged from 8% to 21.1% across different countries or regions [ [2](#B2-healthcare-11-00830)]. Another study reported that the prevalence rate of CPP in females may be twice as high as in males [ [3](#B3-healthcare-11-00830)]. A previous study using the United Kingdom primary care database reported that the annual prevalence of non-cyclic CPP in females may have been as frequent as migraine, back pain, and asthma between 1991 and 1995 [ [4](#B4-healthcare-11-00830)]. It has been estimated that the direct annual medical cost (physician visit plus health care expenditure) and indirect economic lost (time lost from work) of CPP in 1994 were 2.8 billion and 555.3 million in the United States, respectively [ [5](#B5-healthcare-11-00830)]. Thus, CPP is a common problem which may cause significant socioeconomic loses. [6](#B6-healthcare-11-00830)]. In addition, more than half (51%) of responders considered that 'Pain management' to be the most important aspect for the care of CPP in women, even above the 'identification of cause of pain'. Non-surgical intervention for CPP often focus on pain relief if the cause of CPP is unknown [ [7](#B7-healthcare-11-00830)]. Pharmacotherapy for the CPP may include prescript of analgesics, hormonal therapies, anticonvulsants, and/or antidepressants to relieve chronic pain and associated mood and sleep symptoms [ [8](#B8-healthcare-11-00830)]. On the other hand, the non-pharmacotherapy also has been recommended to treat CPP, including physiotherapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, dietary therapy, neuromodulation, pain education, and lifestyle advice [ [9](#B9-healthcare-11-00830), [10](#B10-healthcare-11-00830)]. However, monotherapy may not be adequate for the management of CPP, and multidisciplinary approaches have been more recommended [ [9](#B9-healthcare-11-00830), [10](#B10-healthcare-11-00830), [11](#B11-healthcare-11-00830)]. [12](#B12-healthcare-11-00830)]. Similar results have been reported in a recent updated analysis (with 20,827 patients) for nonspecific musculoskeletal pain, osteoarthritis, chronic headache, or shoulder pain [ [13](#B13-healthcare-11-00830)]. Furthermore, other meta-analysis studies have also reported superior efficacy of acupuncture intervention for the relief of postoperative pain [ [14](#B14-healthcare-11-00830)], myofascial pain [ [15](#B15-healthcare-11-00830)], cancer-related pain [ [16](#B16-healthcare-11-00830)], as well as primary dysmenorrhea [ [17](#B17-healthcare-11-00830)], endometriosis [ [18](#B18-healthcare-11-00830)], irritable bowel syndrome [ [19](#B19-healthcare-11-00830)], and chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP-CPPS) [ [20](#B20-healthcare-11-00830)]. Since the revised standards for reporting interventions in clinical trials of acupuncture (STRICTA) has been introduced in 2010 to improve the quality of clinical trial report [ [21](#B21-healthcare-11-00830)], in the present study we performed a systematic review on randomized controlled trial (RCT) of acupuncture for pain management of CPP from January 2011 to September 2022, and then conducted meta-analysis to determine the treatment efficacy of acupuncture in pain management of CPP, without prior registration of the review protocol on public website or database. Moreover, acupuncture treatment can be administered as monotherapy or as adjunctive therapy with other approaches. We also investigated the analgesic effect of acupuncture, whether administered as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy, to probe the possible difference between treatment strategies. 2.

Disagreements were resolved by discussion among two authors and the arbiter YH Chen. 2.5. Data Synthesis 3. Results 3.1. Study Selection [Figure 1](#healthcare-11-00830-f001)). All included studies were published between April 2011 and September 2022. Ten studies were published in [35](#B35-healthcare-11-00830), was administrated as an adjunctive therapy in 6 RCTs, whereas acupuncture intervention was administrated as a monotherapy in 11 RCTs ( [Table 2](#healthcare-11-00830-t002)). The intervention periods were ranged from 2 weeks to 6 months ( [Table 2](#healthcare-11-00830-t002)). 3.2.3. Controls [Table 2](#healthcare-11-00830-t002)). The intervention periods for control intervention were ranged from 2 weeks to 6 months ( [Table 2](#healthcare-11-00830-t002)). 3.2.4. Outcome Measures 3.3. Risk of Bias 2](#healthcare-11-00830-f002)). 3.4. Pain Management 3.4.1. Overall Effect [Figure 3](#healthcare-11-00830-f003)). The post-intervention data pooled from 10 RCTs which assessed pain level with VAS or NRS also revealed a significantly lower pain level with acupuncture intervention than with control intervention (MD = 1.87, 95% CI [2.55, 1.20], p < 0.00001). However, a serious heterogeneity has been found among these 10 RCTs (Chi-square Subgroup Analysis of Control Interventions [Figure 5](#healthcare-11-00830-f005)). 3.4.4. Subgroup Analysis of Therapeutic Strategy [9](#B9-healthcare-11-00830), [10](#B10-healthcare-11-00830)], we conducted a subgroup analysis for different therapeutic strategy (adjunctive therapy or monotherapy). For the RCTs which assessed pain level with total pain scores of NIH-CPSI, pooled post-intervention data from 2 RCTs with adjunctive acupuncture intervention revealed significantly lower pain level in acupuncture than in control (MD = 2.27, 95% CI [3.00, 1.55], p < 0.00001). Pooled post-intervention data from 5 RCTs with monotherapy of acupuncture also revealed significantly lower pain level in acupuncture than in control (MD = 2.06, 95% CI [2.41, 1.70], p < 0.00001). No significant subgroup differences were found (Chi-square = 0.28, p = 0.60; I2 = 0%) ( [Figure 6](#healthcare-11-00830-f006)a). For the RCTs assessed pain level with VAS or NRS, pooled post-intervention data from 4 RCTs with adjunctive acupuncture intervention revealed significant lower pain levels in acupuncture than in control (MD = 1.70, 95% CI [2.68, 0.72], p = 0.0006). Pooled post-intervention data from 4 RCTs with monotherapy of acupuncture also revealed significantly lower pain levels in acupuncture than in control (MD = 1.97, 95% CI [2.79, 1.15], p < 0.00001). No significant subgroup differences were found (Chi-square = 0.17, = 0.68; number of pooling studies that used NIH-CPSI scores were less than 10, no funnel plot asymmetry was investigated. 4. Discussion [40](#B40-healthcare-11-00830), [41](#B41-healthcare-11-00830), [42](#B42-healthcare-11-00830)]. Although the possible mechanisms between different acupuncture interventions and the possible correlations represented among these RCTs cannot be probed in the present study, it seems that the analgesic effect of acupuncture intervention on CPP may be more contributed from the central mechanisms than the peripheral mechanisms. This notion is supported by the fact that more remote but not local acupoints were selected for acupuncture treatment in these RCTs. In TCM, it is well known that different acupoints may have different effects on the body. These acupoints have been noted for their curative effects that can produce a certain clinical effect regardless of the intervention method applied. Hence, more studies are needed to clarify the possible contributions from central and peripheral mechanisms to optimize the treatment effect of acupuncture. [13](#B13-healthcare-11-00830)]. In the present study, the clinical pain management efficacy of acupuncture, regardless of the intervention method, was better than that of Western medication and TCM medication, and have trans of better efficacy than standard care. It has been suggested that combining different approaches may be one of the more effective treatment strategies for CPP [ [9](#B9-healthcare-11-00830), [10](#B10-healthcare-11-00830), [11](#B11-healthcare-11-00830)]. Our results further reveal that acupuncture can relieve the pain of CPP whether used in adjunctive therapy or monotherapy. In clinical practice, acupuncture has the characteristics of being able to cooperate with other treatment methods, and different acupuncture intervention process and methods can also be combined with each other in most situations. Acupuncture treatment is characterized by low cost and few side effects [ [35](#B35-healthcare-11-00830), [43](#B43-healthcare-11-00830)]. Combined with the results of the present study, acupuncture may not only beneficial for pain management on CPP even conducted with the strategy of monotherapy, but also may lower the direct or indirect huge medical resource consuming and/or personal economic costs. [1](#B1-healthcare-11-00830)]. The results of the present study revealed that acupuncture-related treatments can generally alleviate the pain of CPP with different etiologies. Although acupuncture approach is generally effective in the treatment of CPP, there are very few published literatures on specific acupuncture methods. In the future, a focus on specific acupuncture methods for various causes of CPP could be explored. Large-scale or multi-center RCTs can be considered to further verify the clinical efficacy of acupuncture for pain management in CPP. These results may help to gain a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of acupuncture treatment on CPP and verify the cost-effectiveness between acupuncture compared to other interventions. [44](#B44-healthcare-11-00830)]. Thus, a random effects model was implemented in the present study. Third, although the revised STRICTA guideline has been purposed in 2010, the majority of the included RCTs in the present study still have some concerns regarding the risk of bias, especially in the domain of \"measurement of the outcome\". This is mainly due to the nature of self-reported subjective pain intensity (patients assessed the outcome themselves). Hence, the objective pain assessment system (e.g., automatic facial expression system) should be introduced in future studies. 5.
