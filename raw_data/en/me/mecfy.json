[Differences between Ayurveda and classical medicine](#section1) [What is healing effect?](#section10) [How does the diet change?](#section11) [What is observed in the healing process?](#section12) Differences between Ayurveda and classical medicine - The body is divided into physiologically connected anatomical organs and systems. - There is a division of different specialists - cardiologists, endocrinologists, orthopedists, nephrologists, neurologists, pediatricians, etc. - Each specialist is responsible for a specific part of the body, often without taking into account the intervention of another colleague in the treatment process. - The leading understanding is that the correct diagnosis is crucial for the effectiveness of treatment. - The human body functions on the principle of unity, as its formation begins with a single cell - a product of fertilization of the egg by sperm. - The notion of a direct connection of the body with the mind and the soul is embedded. When a disease disorder occurs, all three aspects of the human being are often affected. - When the three energies - Vata, Pitta and Kapha - are in a balanced state, one enjoys health. When one, two or all of the energies are in a state of imbalance, a disease disorder begins. [The Ayurvedic doctor](/ekip-na-ayurveda-bansko/)is trained to follow the eight branches of Ayurveda at the same time. They are: - Kaya Chikitsa (general medicine) - Bala Chikitsa (pediatrics) - Graha Chikitsa (psychiatry) - Urdwanga Chikitsa (diseases of the head and throat) - Shalya Chikitsa (surgery) - Damshrta Chikitsa (toxicology) - Chikitsa Vrushya medicine) What is \"cure for disease\" in Ayurveda? Each of the three main energies has its own distinctive characteristics and areas of more pronounced influence in the body. 1. Vata - The characteristics of Vata are: - Rooksha - dryness - Laghu - lightness - Sheeta - cold - Khara - roughness - Sookshma - precision - Chala - dynamism It manifests itself in joint pain, muscle spasms, tingling in the extremities, feeling weak or hyperactive. Impaired motor functions of the body are often associated with an imbalance of Vata energy. 2. Pitta - The characteristics of Pitta are: - Sasneha - light oiliness - Teekshna - deep penetration into tissues - Ushna - heat - Laghu - lightness - Visram - bad smell - Sara - poor mobility - Drava - liquid These include burning sensation, acidity and deep colic-like pain. Indigestion, a feeling of heaviness in the abdomen, as well as hunger on an empty stomach are associated with energy imbalance Pitta. 3. Kapha - The characteristics of Kapha are: - Snighdna - fat - Sheeta - cold - Guru - weight - Manda - softness - Shlakshana - smoothness - Mrustna - jelly-like - Sthira - immobility and stability In this area the characteristics of Kapha energy are more often manifested: stagnant processes, deposition of oily, heavy and moist (mucus-like) liquid. Secretion through the mouth and nose for colds, flu, colds, coughs and more. Usually associated with Kapha energy imbalance. Integrity and unity Changing each of these characteristics can lead to symptoms in the part of the body for which the energy is responsible. Accordingly, we can understand the presence of pathological abnormalities, which are defined as a disease. Diagnostic methods in Ayurveda How the imbalance of basic energies affects the body? Agni is a concept related to the power of digestion (\"digestive fire\") - the breakdown of food and its metabolic transformation into all tissues. Often, health disorders are caused by impaired lamb function. There are several types of lambs associated with the influence of the three energies: 1. Sama agni - balanced and good digestion, in which all foods are fully degraded. 2. Vishama agni - a metabolic condition associated with the accumulation of Vata energy. This causes changes in digestion, which sometimes speeds up and sometimes slows down. 3. Tikshna agni - interference in the digestive process by increasing the energy of the pita. It leads to acceleration of metabolic processes, a feeling of increased acidity, rapid digestion and increased feeling of hunger. 4. Manda agni - slowing down metabolic processes due to the accumulation of more energy Kafa. Leads to slow digestion, a sharp decrease in hunger and reluctance to eat. \"Digestive fire\" is extremely important for determining the metabolic state of the body, because this transforming force of the body is responsible for the transfer of energy to individual tissues. Food is associated with the formation and maintenance of all structures that make up the body, so it is important to determine what is the state of transformation carried out in individual tissues - dhatu. There are 7 levels of tissue transformation: - Rasa - transformation from food pulp into plasma, lymph and intercellular fluid. - This transforming zone is related to tissue nourishment. - The leading element is water, the density is increased. - The qualities are liquid, cold, moist, soft and heavy. - This defines the Rasa date as the basic essence for maintaining Kapha energy. - Rakta - transformation of the nutritional energy from the previous level, Race, to the formation of the blood. - The qualities of Rakta are similar to those of Pitta energy. - This transformation zone maintains the hot essence of the body. - Mamsa - transformation of nutritional energy from the level of Rakta to the formation of muscle tissue. - The main quality that is formed is strength, complemented by stability and density. - Here we find the element earth and the penetration of the element fire. - The energies Kapha and Pitta have a leading presence in this area. - Medas - transformation of energy from the level of Mams to the formation of adipose tissue. - There is a kind of storage of the elements of water and earth. - This bodily essence is associated with softening, moisturizing and protecting the body from heat loss. - The main qualities of Kapha energy are present again. - Asthi - transformation of energy from the level of Honey to the formation of bone tissue. - The leading quality is dharana, i.e. keeping the body upright. - The strong influence of Vata energy can be found here. - When Vata is increased, the density decreases. - When Vata is lowered, Asti date is raised. - Majja - transformation of energy from the level of Asti inwards, to the bone marrow or nerve tissue. - This is the substance that fills the bone cavity. - Eye tissue and brain also belong to the Maija date. - The main quality is poorana, ie. filling the bone void. - Kapha energy has a strong influence here. - Shukra - the essence of Maija, which passes into the reproductive tissue of the germ (cells of men and women). - The main quality is garbhotpadana - reproduction of a generation. - Kapha energy also has a strong influence here. Sama (balanced state), Kshaya (reduced dosha) and Vriddhi (increased dosha). What diseases cure?
