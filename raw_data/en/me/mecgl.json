So when you need fuel, you need to eat. But did you know that you can choose foods that have specific vibrations that correspond to some chakras, thereby helping to raise the chakra's vibration and recharging it? With this knowledge, you can eat for bodily fuel and eat to support your chakras. Nourishing Energy Chakras are spinning \"wheels of light\" or energy centers in the body that start at the root chakra at the base of the spine, and travel up to the crown chakra at the top of your head, stopping at five other points along the way. When your chakras are open and operating at their fullest, they draw fresh energy in from the unified field that replenishes and nourishes your personal energy field and keeps you healthy. The Cost of Imbalanced Chakras Each chakra rules over a different part of your body and different areas of your life, so if a chakra is out of whack, the body parts and life arenas it rules will also become imbalanced. For example, the heart chakra is connected to the lungs, the circulatory system, and your heart, and rules relationships and your ability to give and receive love. If your heart chakra is distorted, you may have trouble maintaining healthy relationships and find it difficult to allow love into your life. If the fourth chakra remains imbalanced for long enough, you could develop physical symptoms like breathing problems or asthma, or even suffer a heart attack or breast cancer. The Rainbow Diet: Food for Energy Healing The good news is that you can clear, charge, and balance your chakras to heal them before physical symptoms ever develop. That is one of the best things about energy medicine\u2014you can address issues in your field before they manifest in your body. Working with a spiritual teacher or energy healer can help you determine which of your chakras needs balancing\u2014and most people have several\u2014and then you can target your efforts toward the energy center that needs the most help. Making your food choices for the health of your chakras is another way to get started healing your chakras, and your life. A colorful rainbow diet will do more than just keep your body healthy \u2014 it will also keep your chakras balanced. Whether you want to lose weight or increase your energy levels, incorporating foods from all the colors of the rainbow will help you achieve balance, so you look and feel your best. Root Chakra Foods Your first chakra is located at the base of your spine and is connected to your security and survival. As your foundation, your root chakra connects you to the physical world. When your root chakra is unbalanced you may not feel safe in your body or find yourself stressed.

Vegetables Can help heal your root chakra include beets, rutabagas, garlic, ginger, turnips, potatoes, onions, and parsnips. Try them roasted with salt and olive oil for an easy grounding meal that is also delicious! Protein Especially red meat, is also grounding (think: earthly mineral stews and bone broths). If you're a vegetarian or vegan, red beans and lentils are a great protein source for your root chakra, as are eggs, tofu, and peanut butter. Hearty harvest grains Grains such as bulgar, buckwheat and whole oats, provide your body with complex carbohydrates and are a valuable source of fiber.

This chakra is the essence of life as seen in bodily fluids like blood and tears and lymph. There is no life on earth without water. While the first chakra challenges you to create structure and hold your ground, the second wants you to let go so your creativity can flow. A healthy sacral chakra aids in control and balance in your life. Pure water It is the best thing you can ingest as a sacral chakra healing food.

As the bridge between your lower three chakras and upper three chakras, the heart chakra is all about balance \u2014 coming into balance within yourself as well as with your relationships and whatever is happening in your environment. Vibrant green nutrient-rich vegetables Especially leafy and cruciferous ones like kale, lettuces, spinach, chard, bok choy, collard greens, and broccoli, will really ramp up the energy of your heart chakra and help to heal it. The fourth chakra is also about balance, and green veggies are neither yin nor yang in Chinese medicine, so they maintain the equilibrium that is essential to the health of this chakra. Green water-based alkalizing fruits Such as limes, green apples, and avocados, will also help balance your heart chakra so that you can become more contemplative and more conscious.

Fruits that grow on trees Like apples, peaches, pears, apricots, and plums, also work to balance the throat chakra. Third eye chakra foods The sixth chakra, called the brow chakra or the third eye, is where your master mind plugs into a new type of wisdom from beyond this realm, providing amazing insights that will allow you to solve any problem. The sixth chakra is located just above your eyebrows in the center of your forehead. Because the sixth chakra is located in your head rather than in your torso like the first five chakras, it has a slightly different nature and is the control center for some very powerful gifts: thinking, wisdom, psychic gifts, and intuition. It's a stunning indigo color, which indicates peace and tranquility. It's all about your intuition, your ability to plan, forecast, sense, and know.

Crown chakra foods The seventh chakra is home to your radiant spiritual center and connection to Source. Your crown chakra is more spirit than earth, so its nourishment really comes from sources other than food, including love and a strong connection to the Divine. Located on the topmost part of your head, eating light meals while engaging in a spirit-boosting activity like meditation can energize your crown chakra. Incense and smudging herbs like sage, copal, myrrh, frankincense, and juniper, can help awaken your crown chakra to the highest form of spiritual communication.
