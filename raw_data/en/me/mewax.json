For example, when we cut our finger our body or get a cold our body is also able to heal on its own with some rest and good nutrition. However, if our immune system is weakened or depleted in key nutrients it may take longer to heal or we may develop an infection. This is because the central energy, which in Homeopathy we call 'vital force' (in Yoga they call it 'Prana' and in Chinese medicine, they call it 'Chi') is out of balance or depleted. A suitable Homeopathic remedy prescribed according to the unique symptoms of the individual would then simulate that central energy to become balanced again. The remedy works as a stimulus or message to our body's energy to wake up and get working again. Nyla will take all your symptoms into account (physical, mental and emotional) in order to understand your body and its individual experience of the imbalance or illness/disease; as it can be totally different from any other person she may consult. Therapeutic Approach: Lifestyle Nutrition Meditation Movement "}
