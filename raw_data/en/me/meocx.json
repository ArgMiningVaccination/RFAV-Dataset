While providing education related to preventive methods and the importance of vaccination, as well as administering vaccinations, public health nurses are key participants in the epidemiological process of seasonal influenza related to the elderly population. In When people see or hear advertisements, whether it be in a magazine or on television, many do not stop to consider or analyze the techniques that go into making the advertisement effective. For instance, the Center for Disease Control has a campaign that has the purpose of promoting the influenza vaccination. If you examine the campaign closely, it becomes clear that the advertising campaign targets a diverse audience of all ages, genders, and races who could all benefit from getting an influenza vaccination. In this advertisement campaign, the Center for Disease Control effectively promotes the benefits of getting an influenza vaccination to a targeted audience using numerous persuasive techniques such as association and universal appeal. Have you ever been in pain to where you feel like your whole body is aching along with a headache? Then, oddly your body temperature changes. One minute your hot then the next you're cold. Some people even have scratchy throats and a mild cough. Well all of these are The CDC's ad campaign promoting influenza vaccinations has a widespread appeal to many audiences due to its use of several proven persuasive techniques. Through the use of association, flattery, and universal appeal, as well as a variety of strategies, the ad campaign is highly convincing and is able to reach many audiences. Lethal Injection: A study of influenza vaccines Every fall season we hear the question; did you get your flu shot yet? It is supposed to protect you from that nasty flu virus that circulates our communities during the fall and winter months. But, did you know that in 2011 the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Adverse Event Reporting Systems Website (AERS) reported 51 deaths caused by the flu vaccine in the United States (U.S.) (CDC,2012). According to National Vaccine Information Center (NVIC), as of July 2012 there have been more than 84,000 reports of adverse reactions, 1000 vaccine related deaths and over 1600 cases of Guillain- Barre syndrome, a acute form of paralysis, triggered by the vaccine (NVIC.ORG). According to the \"Commonwealth of Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services\" that as of February 2, 2018 that there have been 100 flu-related fatalities from the flu this year alone and at least four of those deaths were children. The influenza shot is an inactivated vaccine made of inactive germs. Because the germs in this vaccination are inactivated or killed, the shot will cause the patients to not get the flu. However, this shot will allow your body to create the antibodies needed to ward off the influenza virus. I feel that for school-aged students under the age of 18 the flu shot should be Last year, only twenty-six percent of eighteen to forty-nine year olds got the flu shot (Singh, 2014). With an average of 200,000 people hospitalized annually due to flu-related symptoms, these low vaccination rates are generating serious health risks among young adults all over the country (National Consumers League, 2013). This winter, at Duke University Medical Center in Durham, N.C., the average age of people hospitalized with influenza was 28.5 years old, and of those that ended up in the Intensive Care Unit of the hospital, only two of the twenty-two had received the flu vaccination (Singh, 2014). The primary reason that young adults do not get the influenza vaccination is that they believe that they are invincible and influenza is not a serious illness (Singh, 2014). One in five Americans who do not receive the influenza vaccination claims that influenza is not a serious illness (National Consumers League, 2013). Of the Americans who do not get vaccinated, forty-five percent cited their good health as a rationale for bypassing vaccination (National Consumers League, 2013). This may be partly due to the targeted measures by the Center for Disease Control (CDC) to increase vaccination rates among children and the elderly. In comparison to the twenty-six percent of young adults that were vaccinated, 56.6% of children (ages six months to seventeen years old) and 66.2% of seniors (ages 65 and older) were vaccinated. When targeted measures are used, they work. The problem The influenza vaccination in not only beneficial to recipients but also those that come in contact with the individuals exposed to or at risk for contracting influenza. Health care workers are at a constant risk of exposure to various diseases and illness including influenza. An emergency such as a vaccination shortage for influenza will not only affect at risk individuals but spread rapidly to all those exposed without knowledge or a-symptomatic at time of encounter. Health care workers will be exposed in physician offices, hospitals, emergency care or urgent care centers with heightened possibility of spreading the illness (CDC, 2015). Health care workers are not limited to the obvious: physicians or nurses but also, therapists, EMS, Annually there are a number of children who contract the influenza during the influenza season that results in an increase in costs in pediatric office visits and antibiotic and other medications consumption and also in a significant increase in absences from school and work. Thus influenza vaccination of children can help reduce the number of visit to pediatric office, hospitalizations, and help prevent the spread of influenza in the wider community. Moreover vaccinating children is cost effective when considering all the cost of treatment for influenza and its complications. Therefore yearly vaccination of children with the inactivated influenza vaccine save parent money and time away from the pediatric clinic. Influenza vaccine does not The problem can be better quantified by gaining understanding of the importance of receiving the flu vaccination. The manager of any health care facility should ensure that staff and patients, specifically those with a higher risk of contracting the flu, receives the yearly influenza vaccination. Health care staff that does not comply with yearly influenza vaccinations should be transferred to a unit with limited patient contact. High-risk patients who are not compliant with receiving the vaccine are to receive further education of the deadly effects associated with developing the influenza virus. In all patients it is imperative to provide proper patient Issue Proposal on the Efficacy of Flu Shots In recent years encouragement to get flu shots has become a yearly mantra. Elderly, children six months to two years, health care workers and immune-deficient people are urged in the strongest terms to go to their doctors or clinics and get a flu shot. This group encompasses about 98 million people. In the fall of 2004 this was in the forefront of American and to some extent the Western World media with the shortage of this flu seasons vaccine. Current medical wisdom states that flu shots are safe, effective and prevent mortality. A recent study published by The Journal of the American Medicine Association (JAMA) has brought the current wisdom into question. On February 14, 2005 JAMA I can easily say that I agree with this article and that I am 100% pro flu shot. With my history as a pharmacy technician I did find myself being able to successfuly convincing some of our patients to receive their flu shots during their visits to the pharmacy. Through working their I learned a lot about how the influenza virus can impact our well being. I did find it suprising that the University of Chicago was able to accuratley predict the flu seasons for the past 15 years and never thought about looking into Australia's flu season and using data collected from them to help prepare for the US's flu season. According to our text book, An Invitation to Health, \"Influenza viruses, which can change their outer protein coats so dramatically that Influenza is an infectious illness that can be spread from one individual to the next. It can be transmitted by means of saliva, nasal secretions, feces and blood. It can also be spread by coming in contact with the virus on contaminated surfaces. Influenza is responsible for an average of 36,000 deaths and for more than 226,000 hospitalizations each year in the United States. (Davidson, 2007-2009, Davis, 2007). This manuscript presents a virological molecular survey of influenza D virus in healthy and respiratory-diseased cattle in Japan. The results are important to acquiring information concerning epidemiology of this new emerging virus. Anyway, some data should be better explained and some conclusions are not coherent with results and cells and avoid the immune system response; also in human influenza infections, this glycan promotes binding of the virus to the glycans on erythrocytes; thus, facilitating the entry of the virus to the cells. Its overexpression on cell membranes is linked to cancer metastasis (Fuster and Esko, 2005; Severi et al., 2007). Therefore, the better understanding of how this post-translational modification occurs, will give insight into options for applications in biotechnology and medical treatments. A way of doing this is generating sialic acid analogues to be accepted by a SiaT enzyme. For instance, studies with various -2-3 and 2 6 linked sialyl galactosides analogues containing C9-modified "}
