It's a powerful word. It means different things to different people. At Sharp HealthCare, the San Diego community defines our purpose and our commitment to be the best place to work, the best place to practice medicine and the best place to receive care. Since 1950, Sharp has grown to serve San Diego County with seven hospitals, th ree affiliated medical groups, a health plan and more than 19,000 employees. In addition, Sharp has pledged to our community an extraordinary standard of care through The Sharp Experi ence \u2014 bringing focus and alignment in all we do to the most basic and cr itical element of the health care equation: people. This commitment shines through Sharp team members every day as they go above and beyond to provide uninterrupted care, programs and services to community members as pandemic -related challenges persist. With the continuation of our systemwide COVID -19 Community Vaccination Program, we've protected our community and workforce against COVID -19 with bivalent boosters and leveraged lessons learned against new threats, such as mpox. Since the beginning of the pandemic , Sharp has cared for more COVID -19 patients than any other health system in San Diego. Each page of the Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Repo rt, Fiscal Year 2022 details our promise to the community. This promise is represented not only by uncompensated care dollars, but also by tens of thousands of hours devoted by Sharp team members to programs and services beyond our medical facilities \u2014 including free health screenings, resources and transportation to those in need, training and career pathway programs for students, and education and support to community members. In fiscal year 2022, Sharp's community benefit contributions totaled $ 541,721,997 . This support represents our commitment to the San Diego community during both ord inary and extraordinary times. As we look ahead to the challenges in health care, our dedication is only further strengthened. We will continue to go above and be yond to provide care and programs that set standards, exceed expectations, and preserve the health and well -being of our community.

Research at Sharp is conducted on all clinical ph ases of drug and device development, and the populations studied span the life cycle \u2014 from newborns to older adults. These clinical trials increase scientific knowledge and enable health care provider s to assess the safety and effectiveness of new treatme nts. At any given time, Sharp participates in approximately 160 clinical trials encompassing many therapeutic areas, including behavioral health, emergency care, gastroenterology, heart and vascular, i nfectious disease, kidney, liver, neurology, newborn ca re, oncology (comprising the largest share of Sharp's clinical trials), orthopedics and, most recently, COVID -19. Since the onset of the pandemic in March 2020, the CFR has reacted with urgency to expedite the opening of 45 new COVID -19 clinical trials. The COVID -19 research program includes sponsor -initiated trials as well as novel studies designed by Sharp Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 25 researchers, three of which received funding from the Sharp HealthCare Foundation. In addition, CFR staff developed in novative practices to safely re cruit, enroll and obtain informed consent from participants. Further, they adapted practices to comply with sponsor and regulatory requirements for remote monitoring. The CFR has accomplished many activities throughout the pa ndemic while maintaining other ongoing research studies . In FY 2022, this included 19 active oncology clinical trials. The team's efforts have resulted in greater access to cutting -edge COVID -19 treatments for patients at both Sharp and non -Sharp health ca re facilities. Since FY 202 0, the CFR's research on COVID -19, including clinical drug trials and impacts on trauma patients, has been cited in multiple journals and news sources, including: The Wall Street Journal ; New England Journal of Medicine ; The Lanc et Respiratory Medicine ; Europe an Journal of Trauma and Emergency Surgery ; Surgery ; Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery ; Cision PR Newswire ; Infectious Disease Therapy ; Critical Care Explorations ; Infection Control & Hospital Epidemiology ; American So ciety of Hematology Annual Meet ing and Exposition ; PLOS ONE ; Public Health Reports ; CalciMedica; and American Journal of Health -System Pharmacy . The CFR's COVID -19 research was also presented at several health care conferences, including the American Society of Health System Pharmacists Midyear Clinical Meeting and Exhibition and the Western States Conference. The HRPP educates and supports Sharp researchers as well as the broader San Diego health and research comm unities regarding the protection of human research participants. As part of its mission, the CFR hosts quarterly meetings on relevant educational topics for community physicians, psychologists, research nurses, study coordinators and students throughout SD C. Throughout FY 202 2, meetings featured a variety of presentations on CO VID-19, including existing clinical trials, the impact of different therapeutics in COVID -19 treatment, the prevalence of COVID -19 among Sharp team members, COVID -19 research innovati ons within the CFR, research supported by the COVID -19 Emergency Response Fund , and other Sharp COVID -19 research updates. In addition, a presentation was given on Perinatal Outcomes of Subjects Enrolled in a Multicenter Trial with a Waiver of Antenatal Co nsent. Outcomes Research Institute Sharp's ORI measures long -term resu lts of care , as well as develops and disseminates best practices for health care delivery. The ORI collaborates with Sharp team members to aid in the design of patient -centered outcomes research projects; assist with study protocol development, data collec tion and analysis; expl ore funding mechanisms for research projects; and facilitate IRB application submissions. The ORI seeks guidance and expertise from the local and national academic communit ies on how to effectively conduct outcomes research to impr ove patient and community health. This networking has resulted in collaborative research partnerships with investigators at SDSU and the University of Arizona. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 26 During FY 2022, the ORI engaged in sev eral new research projects. An ORI collaboration with op hthalmology researchers plans to evaluate a smartphone application (app) \u2014 developed internally by Sharp \u2014 that is designed to improve cataract patient compliance with pre - and post -surgery care instr uctions. In preparation for a future research study, the ORI consulted with oncology staff who have developed a new clinical program for patients experiencing cancer -related cognitive impairment. The ORI is also leading Sharp's continuing participation as one of six national sites in the University of Arizona's five-year National Institutes of Health -awarded grant study titled Ethnicity and Lung Cancer Survival: A Test of the Hispanic Sociocultural Hypothesis. Evidence -Based Practice Institute The Eviden ce-Based Practice Institute (EBPI ) is offered by the San Diego Consortium for Excellence in Nursing and Allied Health, which was established in 2006 to promote the use of evidence -based practices in the health care community. The EBPI offers professional development opportunities that prepare teams of staff fel lows and mentors to change and improve clinical practice and patient care through identifying a care problem, developing a plan to solve it and incorporating this new kn owledge into practice . The consortium is a partnership between Sharp, Rady Children's H ospital - San Diego, UC San Diego Health, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) San Diego Healthcare System, Kaiser Permanente, PLNU, SDSU, APU and USD. In 2020, the consortium formed a nonprofit corporation with formal board member roles, including team members from Sharp who serve as chairman, president and chief information officer. In addition to board leadership, Sharp provides instructors and mentors to support the EBPI's mission. EBPI fellows and mentors partner with one another through a variety of learning strategies. Mentors facilitate and support fellows as they navigate the health care system and implement the processes of evidence -based practice change. Me ntors also assist fellows in working collaboratively with key project stakeholders. His torically, the EBPI has included six in -person, full -day classes featuring group activities, self - directed learning programs outside of the classroom and structured ment orship throughout the program. Starting in 2021, the program has used an interactive, v irtual platform to deliver education structured around the 8A's Evidence -Based Practice Model. Created by experts in evidence -based practice from Sharp and UC San Diego Health, the model guides the translation of evidence into practice and results in enhan ced decision -making and better outcomes. The model includes the following steps: The Catalyst, Assessing, Asking, Acquiring, Appraising, Applying, Analyzing, and Advanci ng and Adopting. The program culminated with a virtual conference and graduation cerem ony in December 2022 , during which the EBPI fellows and mentors shared their project results. Thirty -three project teams, composed of mentors and fellows, graduated from the program. Projects addressed issues in clinical practice and patient care , includin g decreasing psychiatric transfers to a higher level of care, improving colonoscopy care, Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 27 stroke education, hospital -acquired pressure injuries, early discharge planning , perineal protection program, de -escalation in the ED, and infant neonatal abstinence syndrome.6 Volunteer Service Sharp Lends a Hand In FY 202 2, Sharp continued its systemwide community service program, Sharp Lends a Hand (SLAH). SLAH uses the findings of Sharp's triennial CHNAs to identify health priorities in SDC that could be ad dressed through volunteer support. In FY 2022, SLAH identified nut rition insecurity as its area of focus, with a goal of collecting a minimum of 10,750 food units7 throughout the year. SLAH selected several activities in FY 2022 to address nutrition inse curity in SDC, including food drives in support of the San Diego Food Bank (Food Bank) as well as volunteer events in partnership with Feeding San Diego (FSD), Mama's Kitchen and ProduceGood. Through the support of Sharp employees, family and friends,8 SLAH contributed nearly 16,900 food units throughout the year, surp assing its goal by over 6,100 units. SLAH also selected five additional volunteer projects for FY 202 2: Wreaths Across America San Diego, Transplant Games of America, Stand Down for Homeless Veterans, Life Rolls On, and the San Diego River Park Foundation' s Clean & Green River Cleanup event. The Food Bank 's mission is to provide nutritious food to people in need, advocate for the hungry and educate the public about hunger -related issues. Each month, t he Food Bank collaborates with 500 nonprofit community partners to provide meals to 600,000 San Diegans. For more than a decade, Sharp has hosted holiday SuperF ood Drives to support the Food Bank's tremendous efforts. During the 202 1 holiday seaso n, Sharp team members were encouraged to donate nutritious and sustaining superfoods to improve access to healthy food for San Diegans in need. Through the holiday SuperFood Drive, 11 locations throughout the Sharp system collected nearly 3,500 pounds (lbs.) of nutritious food and nearly $4,200 for the Food Bank \u2014 a total of 7,646 food units . SLAH also collected nearly 5,000 food units during the Grossmont Spring Drive and collaborated with Sharp Best Health on two Move for Good food drive eve nts in January and August, which collected over 4,700 food units. As a member of the Feeding America network, FSD partners with 600 local food donors throughout SDC \u2014 including grocery stores, restaurants and retailers \u2014 to distribute 6 Neonatal abstinence syndrome is a withdrawal syndrome that can occur in newborns exposed to certain substances, including opioids, du ring pregnancy. 7 A \"food unit\" is defined as one pound of food, one volunteer hour to an organization that provides food assistance or one dollar to a Sharp sponsored virtual food drive. 8 The time associated with Sharp employees , who were compensated du ring their S harp Lends a Hand volunteer service , is financially valued in this report, but the time of other Sharp volunteers, family members and friends is not financially valu ed in this report. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 28 more than 35 million meals to loca l children, families, seniors and military members each year. FSD relies on the generous support of individuals, corporations, foundations and community groups to sustain critical hunger -relief and nutrition programs throughout the region. In January , four SLAH volunteers sorted food, prepared bags for distribution and cleaned produce for FSD. Established in 1990, Mama's Kitchen is a community -driven organization that enlists volunteers to he lp prepare and deliver nutritious meals to community members affe cted by AIDS or cancer who are unable to shop or cook for themselves. Mama's Kitchen strives to help its clients stay healthy, preserve their dignity, and keep their families together by providing free and culturally appropriate home -delivered meals, pantr y services an d nutrition education. In May, four SLAH volunteers helped Mama's Kitchen serve meals by preparing and packaging snack and vegetable items for delivery. ProduceGood is a local organization committed to solving the problem s of hunger and food waste in one step. With volunteer support , ProduceGood collects excess produce in SDC, providing healthy food for San Diego's food insecure community members while helping to keep food out of the landfill. At three events in March, eight SLAH volunteers he lped pick fru it at orchards in Valley Center and Rancho Santa Fe. In December 20 21, SLAH participated in Wreaths Across America, a national event dedicated to honoring veterans, remembering fallen heroes and teaching children about the sacrifices made by veterans and their families. At Fort Rosecrans National Cemetery, more than 50 SLAH volunteers honored veterans by placing donated wreaths on their gravesites. Several SLAH volunteers assisted with the Donate Life Transplant Games of America \u2014 a multi -sport event prod uced by the Transplant Life Foundation for individuals who have undergone life -saving transplant surgeries. Competition is open to organ recipients, corneal and tissue transplant recipients, bone marrow recipients, as well as living kidney and liver donors . Held at the San Diego Convention Center in July and August, the event featured over 20 sports, opening and closing ceremonies and various other activities , including a vendor fair, coffee house and a special ceremony honoring living and dece ased donors. SLAH participated in Stand Down for Homeless Veterans, an event sponsored by the Veterans Village of San Diego, to provide community -based social services to veterans without a permanent residence. Over three days in July, a Sharp employee v olunteered in the event's pharmacy tent . Veterans Village of San Diego has served the local community since 1981, helping thousands of SDC's most vulnerable veterans to reclaim their lives through programs that offer transitional and permanent housing, men tal health co unseling, substance use treatment, and employment and job training services. The Life Rolls On Foundation is dedicated to improving the quality of life for people living with various disabilities. Through the organization's award -winning prog ram, They Will Surf Again, paraplegic and quadriplegic community members can experience Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 29 mobility through surfing with support from adaptive equipment and volunteers. At the events in October 2021 and September 2022, nearly 170 SLAH volunteers assisted They Will Surf Ag ain with event set-up and breakdown, registration, equipment distribution, hospitality and helping surfers on land and in shallow water. Founded in 2001, the San Diego River Park Foundation is a grassroots nonprofit organization that works to protect the greenbelt from the mountains to the ocean along the 52 -mile San Diego River. In November , 10 SLAH volunteers joined the Clean & Green Rive r Cleanup event, where they helped remove trash and debris along Forester Creek in Santee . In addition to these projects, the SLAH program continued to coordinate and promote Sharp's year -round blood donation effort to provide needed blood to local organ izations serving the community. In FY 202 2, Sharp hosted 60 blood drives at 12 Sharp locations to benefit the San Diego Blood Bank. In addition, SLAH encouraged Sharp employees to donate blood at local American Red Cross locations. Despite limitations rela ted to the ongoing COVID -19 pandemic , SLAH helped Sharp collect approximately 1,500 units of blood . Shar p Humanitarian Service Program The Sharp Humanitarian Service Program provides paid leave for Sharp employees to volunteer for programs that provide h ealth care or other supportive services to underserved or adversely affected populations throughout the w orld. In FY 2022, program participation was severely limited as a result of COVID -19 public health guidelines. Despite these challenges, the Sharp Huma nitarian Service Program funded eight employees for various humanitarian efforts, providing service to co mmunities across the globe. Three of these opportunities are described below. Over two weeks in September, two Sharp ED nurses traveled to seven diff erent cities in the Philippines with San Diego Central Seventh -day Adventist Church's Love in Action medi cal mission. The nurses joined a group of physicians, nurses, dentists and medical students to provide medical and dental care, acupuncture, minor oper ations and eyeglasses to approximately 2,500 patients in those communities. Maximo Nivel is an organiza tion dedicated to improving communities in Costa Rica, Guatemala and Peru through a vast array of programs, including medical and dental assistance for vulnerable individuals. For one week in May, a Sharp occupational therapist traveled to Cusco, Peru , to join a team of physical therapists, nuns and a nurse to provide occupational therapy services as well as help deliver morning meals and administer medi cations to elderly nursing home residents. A Sharp registered nurse (RN) traveled to the highlands of Huehuet enango, Guatemala for 10 days in May through HELPS International, a nonprofit organization committed to addressing the root causes of poverty in Guatemala through community development, agriculture, education and health care programs. The Sharp RN, along with a Sharp - affiliated o phthalmologist and other eye specialists, provided life -saving health care and Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 30 community development services. The team restored vision to many blinded by cataracts as well as assisted patients suffering from birth defects, eyelid tumors, tear duct infections and more. Community Walks Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the U.S. and the second leading cause of death in SDC. Sharp proudly supports the AHA 's annual San Diego Heart & Stroke Walk, which promotes physical activity to bui ld healthier lives, free of CVD and stroke. In FY 2022, nearly 100 teams across the Sharp system helped raise nearly $180,000 for the walk, through activities such as auctions, prize drawings, and plant and garage sales. Sharp held a pre -walk event called the Move More Activity Challenge, which began 30 days prior to the walk and included a free activity tracker and various step challenges to help inspire walkers to meet their goals. In September, the walk was held at Balboa Park and included both one - and four-mile path options. More than 700 employees, family members and friends represented Sharp during the walk and enjoyed a fun, heart -healthy experience together. For the past 26 years, Sharp has maintained its position as the firs t-place fundraising team in San Diego and, in 2022, was the first - place team in the AHA Western States Affiliate. Sharp has raised nearly $4 million since its support of the AHA Heart & Stroke walk began. Sharp Volunteers Volunteers are a critical compo nent of Sharp's dedication to the San Diego community and help make a difference in the lives of others. Sharp provides many volunteer opportunities for individuals of all ages and skill levels to assist with a wide variety o f programs, events and initiati ves. This includes devoting time and compassion to patients within Sharp's hospitals; assisting with community events for the public; and supporting annual golf tournaments, galas and other activities to benefit Sharp's found ations, including the Sharp Hea lthCare Foundation, Grossmont Hospital Foundation and Coronado Hospital Foundation. As a result of the COVID -19 pandemic, Sharp's in -person volunteer activities were limited throughout FY 2022. Sharp will continue to monitor COVID -19 public health guidelin es to support volunteer opportunities as appropriate. On average, more than 620 individuals actively volunteered at Sharp each month between October 2021 and September 2022.9 This included more than 1,150 auxiliary members , individual volunteers from the San Diego community and volunteers for Sharp's foundations. During this time, volunteers contributed over 105,200 hours of service to Sharp and its initiatives.10 More than 9,900 of these hours were dedicated to activities in the community, such as deliver ing meals to homebound seniors and assisting with events. See Table 2 and Figure 2 for volunteer participation at Sharp in FY 2022. 9 The total represents the average number of active voluntee rs at Sharp per month in FY 202 2. 10 The total represents the number of volunteer hours at Sharp in FY 202 2. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 31 Table 2: Sharp HealthCare Volunteers and Volunteer Hours \u2014 FY 2022 Figure 2: Sharp HealthCare Volunteers by Entity \u2014 FY 2022 Sharp also offers a systemwide Junior Volunteer program for high school students to give back to their communities and explore future health care careers. Participation in the program requ ires a minimum grade point average and a long -term commitment of at least 100 hours. The Junior Volunteer program supports workforce development by introducing students to careers in health care, including clinical and ancillary support services. Junior vo lunteers enhance patient -centered care through hospitality, such as greeting and escorting patients and families, answering questions and creating a welcoming and relaxing environment for guests. By volunteering in the gift shops and thrift store, students learn about merchandising, fundraising and retail sales. On the inpatient units, they assist as appropriate with clinical and non -clinical tasks.

In FY 2022, more than 2 60 high school students contribu ted over 20,500 hours to the Junior Volunteer program. This included nearly 100 junior volunteers who dedicated over 6,100 hours of service at SCVMC and more than 160 junior volunteers who contributed approximately 14,400 hours of service at SGH. Due to ho spital visitor restrictions due to the COVID -19 pandemic, the SMH and SMBHWN Junior Volunteer programs remained paused throughout FY 202 2. SGH junior volunteers assisted with games, giv eaways and wayfinding at several of SGH's Family Nights \u2014 free socia l events for SGH staff and their families \u2014 including a drive-in movie featuring Jurassic Park . In honor of Veteran's Day in November, three SGH junior volunteers helped decorate the hospi tal's Brier Patch Campus with signs and flags and painted red, white , and blue stars on the lawn to show appreciation and gratitude. SGH volunteers continued to assist with the hospital's Discharge with Dignity program. Designed for patients who may be e xperiencing homelessness, transferring to SNFs, or lacking friends o r family to help, Discharge with Dignity provides clothing, shoes and other necessary personal items upon discharge from the hospital. In partnership with the Grossmont Healthcare District , SGH hosted a community drive -thru clothing drive in October, which collected more than 4,500 articles of clothing and shoes for the hospital's patients in need. During the event, 14 SGH junior, college and adult volunteers helped unload and sort items do nated by community members. With the return of volunteers at SCVMC and at the bedside, the Patient Activity Companion program (formerly the Community Care Partner program) resumed providing services in person. These volunteers are available to take the p lace of a care partner when a patient does not have one. Volunteers provided comfort and support to lonely patients at their bedside if family members or friends were not available. Volunteers also offered reading mat erials, arts and crafts, word puzzles a nd other activities. The Patient Activity Companion program included 11 junior, college student and senior volunteers who offered more than 280 hours of service in FY 2022. Throughout FY 2022, SCVMC volunteers contin ued to knit, sew and crochet various items for patients in need at the hospital, including cloth face masks, lap robes, prayer and baby blankets, booties, hair bonnets and caps. The volunteers met off campus every week and worked at home independently. Com pleted items were sent to the hospital, where they were distributed to patients by social workers and chaplains. In addition, in December, an SCVMC volunteer provided 13 hours of service to an on -site COVID -19 vaccination clinic. SCHHC continued to offer COVID -19 vaccines at its on -site pharma cy. More than 50 community volunteers assisted with registration and monitoring discharged vaccinated individuals, contributing more than 1,200 hours. In addition, SCHHC continued to Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 33 partner with Meals on Wheels San D iego County to offer the Sharp Coronado Hospital Auxiliary Meals on Wheels Adopt -a-Route program. This program provides meals with enhanced nutritional quality, free pet food, in -home safety and health assessments, sliding -scale payment options for those i n need, a secure mobile delivery app to communicate follow -up information, and an emergency response if needed. This partnership helps promote independence, reduce social isolation, and improve participants' quality of life and health. In FY 2022, SCHHC au xiliary members and volunteers provided nearly 5,800 meals to approximately 40 community members. Sharp employees also donated time as volunteers for the Sharp organization, including service on the Board of Directors of Coast Center for Orthopedic and A rthroscopic Surgery, San Diego Imaging - Chula Vista, San Diego Imaging - Kearny Mesa, Sharp and Children's MRI, Grossmont Imaging, and Sharp and UC San Diego Health's Joint Venture, which oversees the operations of their joint Liver Transplantation and Bo ne Marrow Transplant programs. In addit ion, Sharp's various entity boards include volunteers who provide program oversight, administration and decision -making regarding the organization's finances. In FY 2022, more than 130 volunteers contributed time to S harp's boards. Sharp HospiceCare Volun teer Programs Sharp HospiceCare provides a variety of training opportunities that offer valuable knowledge and experience to volunteers who are often working toward a career in the medical field. Volunteers are essential to the hospice team \u2014 they provid e important relief to those near the end of life and their families and caregivers, as well as vital clerical and community support activities for the hospice organization. In FY 2022 , approximately 50 individuals completed Sharp HospiceCare's volunteer training program , which included a combination of online and in -person learning experiences to affirm volunteers' understanding of and commitment to hospice care prior to beginning their duties . Volunteers provided a variety of nonmedical services at SNFs , hospitals, patient homes and Sha rp HospiceCare's LakeView, ParkView and BonitaView hospice homes. This included patient companionship, caregiver relief, light housekeeping, errands, administrative support, event planning and community outreach. In additio n, a volunteer hairdresser traveled more than 3,300 miles throughout SDC to provide 125 haircuts to Sharp HospiceCare patients in FY 2022. All patient and caregiver support activities were conducted using appropriate personal protective equipmen t and in co mpliance with public health guidelines. Throughout the year, volunteers contributed approximately 3,900 hours to patient care and support, including both in -person activities as well as telephone assistance depending on patient preference. Four teenager s participated in Sharp HospiceCare's Teen Volunteer program in FY 2022. The teen agers performed activities at Sharp HospiceCare's hospice homes, including patient grooming , sitting with patients, listening to their stories and holding their hand. They also completed special projects in Sharp HospiceCare administration . Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 34 In FY 2022, three nursing and eight premedical students from SDSU and UC San Diego volunteered their time by supporting family caregivers in private homes. Ten former Sharp Hospice Care studen t volunteers are currently in medical school, which demonstrates the value of the hospice volunteer experience \u2014 including the enhanced understanding of death and dying \u2014 in the pursuit of a medical career. Sharp HospiceCare's 11 th Hour progra m ensures t hat no patient dies alone. Through the program, volunteers accompany patients who are in their final moments of life and do not have a family member present. This includes holding the patient's hand, reading softly to them and remaining by their side. Volu nteers may also provide emotional support to family members who are present. In FY 202 2, 11th Hour program volunteers served eight patients. Since 2018, Sharp HospiceCare volunteers have helped patients enjoy one last visit to a location of th eir choice through the Sentimental Journey program, sponsored by American Medical Response (AMR). Through the program, an AMR ambulance crew picks up hospice patients from their residence and transports them to a special place they can no longer access on their own d ue to their illness progression. In FY 2022, Sharp HospiceCare volunteers accompanied two patients and their family members on their sentimental journeys, which included a Valentine's Day dinner and a trip to the beach. Seven volunteers suppor ted Sharp H ospiceCare's partnership with We Honor Veterans (WHV) in FY 202 2. WHV is a national program developed by the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization in collaboration with the VA to empower hospice professionals to meet the unique end -of-life need s of veterans and their families. As a WHV partner, Sharp HospiceCare is equipped to provide education and training that qualifies its volunteers to identify and support veteran patients and their caregivers. This includes the Vet -to-Vet Volunte er program, which pairs volunteers who have military experience with veteran patients receiving hospice or home -based palliative care. The program also honor s veteran patients through special pinning ceremonies, during which volunteers present veterans wit h a WHV pin and a certificate of appreciation for their service. In celebration of Veterans Day in November, volunteers recognized 63 Sharp HospiceCare veteran patients through these pinning ceremonies. Sharp HospiceCare continued to offer the Memory Bear program to support community members who have lost a loved one. Volunteers create teddy bears out of the garments of those who have passed on, which served as special keepsakes for family members. In FY 202 2, volunteers dedicated over 1,900 hours to sewin g more than 480 bears for approximately 250 families. Sharp HospiceCare recognizes volunteers' valuable impact on patients and their families and caregivers. During National Hospice and Palliative Care Month in November, Sharp HospiceCare recognized its v olunteers t hrough special award and pinning celebrations. During National Volunteer Week in April, volunteers were invited to Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 35 SGH's Volunteer Awards Open House event at the Sheraton San Diego Hotel & Marina, where they gathered to celebrate their contribut ions to Sha rp HospiceCare and share a meal . Further, in FY 2022, Sharp HospiceCare provided six virtual continuing education and support meetings to enhance volunteers' knowledge and skills .

What's Your Story volunteers support patient - centered care by facilitating a simple interview with patients involving story a nd identity sharing , then display a poster about the patient in their room to stimulate personal connections with others during their stay. At SMH, Arts for Healing primarily serves patients who are receiving cancer treatment, recovering from surgery or stroke, awaiting organ transplantation, receiving palliative care or are adjusting to life with newly acquired disabilities following a catast rophic even t. The program provides weekly music and art therapy groups to adults recovering from strokes, brain in juries and spinal cord injuries at the Sharp Allison deRose Rehabilitation Center . In FY 202 2, Arts for Healing facilitated the donation of more than 90 blankets hand -knitte d or crocheted by generous local community members to patients receiving palliative care, end -of-life care and infusion therapy services at the hospital . At SMBHWN, the program serves mothers with high -risk pregnancies who ar e susceptible to stress and loneliness during extended hospital stays. From October through March, the program pro vided m usic therapy to infants in the NICU and their families to promote bonding and infant development. At SMV and SMC, Arts for Healing offers several art and music therapy groups, including those for adolescents and adults receiving treatment for substa nce use and mood or anxiety disorders, as well as older adults receiving treatment for dementia or depression. Historically, Arts for Healing also provides arts experiences to community members at public events. However, these opportunities were not provid ed in FY 2022 due to the ongoing COVID -19 pandemic. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 36 Since August 2020, Arts for Healing has partnered with Project Music Heals Us \u2014 a New Yor k-based nonprofit that provides inspiration, education and healing through live performances and interactive progr amming to marginalized communities throughout the country, with a recent focus on serving hospitalized adults experiencing isolation. At SMH, this include s weekly, individualized concerts performed virtually for patients by a professional harpist . The partnership initially offered the concerts to patients with heightened isolation precautions . However, as the COVID -19-positive patient population decreased, the program began to offer concerts to patients with an extended stay, including oncology and hear t transplant patients. In addition, since February 2021, virtual Project Music Heals Us concerts have inc luded two group concerts per month for inpatients of the Sharp Allison DeRose Rehabilitation Center. Group concerts are performed by professional music ians from around the world and are facilitated by recreation therapy staff. In FY 2022, Arts for Healing continued to respon d to the stress, overwhelm and emotional and physical fatigue experienced by many Sharp staff during COVID -19 surge s by providing s taff \u2014 primarily at SMH \u2014 with a variety of inspirational and reflective arts experiences . Giant colorin g murals were placed in the main lobby at SMH to promote stress relief. As the murals' popularity grew throughout the year, they expanded to all nursin g units a s well as nearly all other hospital departments. Several murals were also provided to staff at SMBHWN and SMV , with more than 90 murals distributed at SMMC in FY 2022. Teams work together and creatively strategize to c onstruct their unique murals. In August, Arts for Healing curated an art show at SMH displaying 55 large and vibrant murals to honor t eam members' creative efforts, build community, relieve stress and inspire and uplift them. In addition, Arts for Healing provided The Wishing Wal l, a community art experience on which staff contributed wishes and prayers . More than 700 wishes and prayers were made on The Wishing Wal l in approximately two months. A volunteer artist with the program later transform ed them into an inspirational work of ar t in the hospital lobby for both employees and guests to observe and reflect upon. In January and February, Arts for Healing partnered with SMH's Integrative Healing team to provide resource stations for staff at 14 locations throughout the hospital. The stations offered vision boards , poetry, aromatherapy , supportive handouts and gratitude grams \u2014 colorful postcards on which staff write words of gratitude to their colleagues . Arts for Healing also provided sound healing and music therapy interventions at nursing stations and during staff huddles. In addition, Arts for Healing implemented a variety of individual supportive arts experiences for staff across SMMC that included mindfulness and self -reflection tools , such as inspirational gem magnets and thera py dough \u2014 a colorful sensory activity using homemade playdough and essential oils. Further, in plac e of the annual Valentine card -making event in February , Arts for Healing created and distributed over 1,000 Valentine card -making kits to staff. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 37 In FY 20 22, three employees and nearly 30 volunteers facilitated art and music experiences for approximately 13,000 patients , visitors and staff through the Arts for Healing program. Since its inception, the time and talent of the program's dedicated volunteers, b oard-certified art and music therapists , and staff have reached more than 229,000 individuals. Othe r Sharp Community Efforts In FY 202 2, Sharp engaged in a variety of community service projects to improve the well-being of community members throughout Sa n Diego. The following are just a few examples of these efforts. According to the 2022 Point -in-Time count conducted by the San Diego Regional Task Force on Homelessness (RTFH), there are at least 8,400 individuals experiencing homelessness in SDC, nearly half of whom are unsheltered. The RTFH also found that in 2022, the number of families experiencing homelessness was up 56% from 2020 . In addition, data from RTFH's 2021 Homelessness Crisis Response System report revealed that the number of individuals in SDC experiencing homelessness for the first time increased 79% from 2019 (2,326 indivi duals) to 2020 (4,152 individuals). Since 2012, Sharp has sponsored the Downtown San Diego Partnership's Family Reunification Program, which serves to reduce the numbe r of unsheltered individuals in Downtown San Diego. Through the program, homeless outre ach coordinators from the Downtown San Diego Partnership's Clean & Safe Program identify unsheltered individuals who would be best served by returning home to their love d ones. The program contacts the individual's family and friends to ensure that they ha ve the support and a place to stay to get back on their feet. The outreach team then provides the necessary transportation to reconnect the individual with their loved o nes. With Sharp's help, the Family Reunification Program has reunited more than 3,500 i ndividuals with friends and family across the nation. For several years, Streets of Hope San Diego has served and provided hope to individuals who experience homelessn ess in downtown San Diego. In April, SMH's 3 North Unit Practice Council team collaborated with Streets of Hope San Diego to host an outreach and collection event in support of unhoused individuals in SDC. During the event, team members distributed clothin g, food, hygiene products , blankets , and other high-need items as well as provided educational materials to teach these community members about common health issues and infection prevention . Also in FY 2022, a group of SMV staff members organized monthly s ock drives and distributed approximately 1,000 pairs of clean socks to unhouse d community members in downtown San Diego. Additionally, SMV staff distributed soup and warm clothing to unhoused individuals during the 2021 winter season. For more than 15 ye ars, Sharp has participated in the U.S. Marine Corps Toys for Tots Program. Du ring the 2021 holiday season, Sharp collected new, unwrapped toys for the program to distribute as holiday gifts to local children in need. Further, Sharp continued Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 38 to host a Ho liday Food Drive for Pets, where bagged or canned food was collected and donat ed to the Food Bank. During the 2021 holiday season, SMBHWN health education staff participated in The Boys and Girls Clubs of Greater San Diego's Adopt-a-Family program. Throu gh this effort, SMBHWN received two famil ies' wish list s and fulfilled them with new, wrapped gifts labeled with each family member 's name. The value of gifts provided was approximately $1 ,000 per family. Further, each family received a meal donation of nearly $250 in addition to the gifts. For the past eight years, SCVMC h as supported Operation Gobble, an event started by Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez Fletcher that provides a turkey and fresh produce to those in need during the Thanksgiving holiday. In F Y 2022, Operation Gobble served 50 patients from the Douglas & Nancy Ba rnhart Cancer Center at SCVMC 's (Barnhart Cancer Center ) Medical and Radiation Oncology departments. Additionally, t he staff at the Barnhart Cancer Center chose to adopt two families during the 2021 holiday season, providing them with toys, clothing and gi ft cards. For more than 30 years, SGH has held its annual Santa's Korner giving event to provide for those in need during the holidays. Through this effort, various hospital department s adopt a family that has been vetted and referred by local service age ncies, including Crisis House and All Kids Academy Head Start, Inc. Using personal resources supplemented by occasional fundraisers, hospital staff purchase holiday gifts for the famili es, including grocery gift cards, clothing, toiletries, household items , children's toys, a holiday meal and other items requested by the families. During the 202 1 holiday season, Santa's Korner served over 150 individuals from 40 families. Since 2014, SG H nurses have collaborated with Christie's Place \u2014 a nonprofit organization that supports women, children and families affected by HIV or AIDS \u2014 for an annual backpack drive to prepare children and teens for academic success. Team members fro m a variety of departments help assemble backpacks with school supplies and personal notes wishing students well during the coming school year. In August, the team gathered approximately 120 backpacks at SGH and delivered them directly to Christie's Place. In May, SGH's Obstetrics and Gynecology Unit Practice Council and Volunteer Services, along with other staff, collaborated to help underserved families with newborns through the annual Sweet Start Family donation program. Now i n its fourth year, the progr am brings hosp ital units together to collect diaper bags and other baby supplies, including hand -made and knitted clothing and items. This year's effort yielded more than 65 diaper bags filled with supplies, in addition to enough supplies to fill at least another 20 bags. The SGH Engineering Department led a variety of volunteer initiatives in FY 2022 . For the past 1 1 years, the SGH Engineering Department has provided This Bud's for You, a special program that delivers hand -picked flowers from the hospita l campus' abun dant gardens to unsuspecting visitors, patients and staff. Through the program, the Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 39 landscaping team grows, cuts, bundles and delivers colorful bouquets to patient rooms along with an inspirational quote. Single -stem roses in a small bud vase are also offe red to individuals passing by. In addition, for the 14th Mother's Day in a row, approximately 30 vases of flowers were delivered to new mothers staying in the hospital. These efforts have become a natural part of the landscape team's day \u2014 acts that are si mply part of what they do to enhance the experiences of hospital visitors and community members. In September, the New Beginnings Boutique and Gift Shop hosted a book donation drive to support the NICU's efforts in the Babies With Books NICU Read -a-Thon event. In conjunction with the SMH Auxiliary and San Diego Neonatology, SMBHWN's NICU provided a b ag and a book to NICU families to encourage them to read to their babies , promoting language building and social -emotional skill development during a critical time. All Ways Green Initiative The health of the planet is integral to our health and quality of life. For more than a decade, Sharp's All Ways Green\u00ae initiative has sought to minimize adverse environmental impacts to the communities Sharp serve s. By reducing greenhouse gas (GHG ) emissi ons \u2014 the primary source of global warming \u2014 Sharp supports its core mission to improve the health of the environment and the local population. Education, outreach and collaboration with San Diego's earth -friendly busi nesses are essential strategies as Sharp works to identify and implement best practices in sustainability . Sharp's Environmental Policy guides the identification and implementation of green practices within the health care system, while its All Ways Green initiative fosters a culture of enviro nmental responsibility throughout the organization and the San Diego community. In FY 2022, Sharp embarked on a comprehensive En vironmental Health, Wellness and Susta inability Plan that targets systemwide improvements to reduce Sharp's carbon footprint , with the goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2040. Sharp's All Ways Green Committee spearheads the organization's sustainabilit y plans, which are organized around ei ght core topics: good health and well -being ; efficient energy ; water conservation ; green building and construction ; waste minimization ; sustainable purchasing ; transportation ; and safer chemicals. Special committees ar e responsible for each of these domains (see Table 3 ), while Green Teams at each Sharp entity are responsible for sustaining existing initiatives and developing new programs to educate and motivate employees to conserve natural resourc es. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 40 Table 3: All Ways Green Committees/Subcommittees and Domains To monitor progress and document tangible results, All Ways Green uses a Shar p- developed report card that measures and trends each domain's annual performance. The report card shows where Sharp has achieved desired results and helps identif y opportunities for improvement to strategically plan initiatives that encourage team members to reduce the organization's carbon footprint. Sharp's accomplishments and goals within each All Ways Green committee/subcommittee and domain are highlighted in the following pages. Natural Resource Conservation According to a recent report from the U.S . House Ways and Means Committee, the U.S. health care system is responsible for nearly 10% of GHGs.11 Hospitals are the third- most energy -intensive commercial buildings in the country , using more than four times the amount of energy as a typical office bui lding.12 Given the significant amount of energy and water required to operate today's hospitals and health facilities, it is important to understand what drives energy consumption and how to cost -effectively implement and optimize energy efficient solutions . A decrease in energy consumption not only reduces GHGs , but also reduces the cost of providing health care. In FY 2022, Sharp became the firs t health care system in San Diego to commit to San Diego Community Power's Power100 program, which provides 1 00% renewable and carbon -free electricity to eligible Sharp facilities. San Diego Community Power is a nonprofit, locally managed Community Choice Aggregation program with the goal of investing in cleaner sources of electricity, such as the energy generate d by wind turbines and solar panels. By committing to the Power100 program, Sharp will strive to reduce its carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions by more than 6,500 metric tons each year, which is equivalent to the emissions generated by driving a gasoline -powere d car over 16 million miles. This investment reflects Sharp's commitment to the environment and aligns with Sharp's goal of attaining carbon neutrality by 2040. Sharp's goal is to optimize the use of precious natural resources across its facilities, identify and evaluate opportunities for improvement, implement initiatives in the most cost-effective manner and track progress. Since 2009, Sharp has completed over 130 energy related projects across the system, resulting in a decrease of over 25,3 00 metric 11 House Ways and Means Committee (2022 ), Health Care and Climate Crisis: Preparing America's Health Care Infrastructure . 12 Energy Star\u00ae Portfolio Manager (2021) U.S. Energy Use Intensity by Property Type .

Natur al gas and electricity are the major types of energy consumed in hospitals. Natural gas is used mainly for cooking and space and water heating, while electri city is used for cooling, lighting and the operation of clinical and administrative equipment. Approximately 70% of a hospital's energy consumption is due to lighting, heating, cooling and hot water production. Heating and cooling activities are driven by strict air quality requirements to maintain continuous safety and comfort.13 A 2017 World Health Organization report encouraged hospitals to proactively address the environmental footprint of the health care sector by reducing power consumption and using alternative energy sources. To address this call, Sharp's Natural Resource Subcommittee continual ly invest s in numerous conservation initiatives, including infrastructure changes and best practices to ensure its facilities operate at optimal levels while m onitoring and measuring energy and water consumption. The subcommittee also educates employees ab out energy -conscious practices in the workplace and at home to promote energy and water savings opportunities . All Sharp hospitals participate in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 's (EPA) Energy Star ( ES) database and monitor their ES scores on a monthly basis, thus following an international standard for energy efficiency created by the EPA. Buildings that are ES-certified must earn a 75 or higher on th e EPA's energy performance scale, indicating that the building performs better than at least 75% of similar buildings nationwide without sacrificing comfort or quality. According to the EPA, buildings that qualify for ES certification typically use 35% or less energy than buildings of similar size and functi on. As a result of Sharp's commitment to superior energy performance and responsible use of natural resources, SCHHC earned ES certification in 2007, 2010 to 2013, and 2017 to 2020. In addition, SCVMC ea rned ES certification in 2009 to 2011, 2013, 2015 to 2018 , 2020 and 202 1. Further, the SRSMC office building in Downtown San Diego was one of the first medical office buildings in SDC to meet Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design silver certificati on standards . Since 2016, the SGH campus has been operating essentially off the electrical grid due to the Brady Family CoGen, a state -of-the-art Central Energy Plant (CEP). The CEP includes a 52-ton, 4.4 -megawatt combustion turbine generator that produc es enough electricity to meet up to 95 % of the hospit al's needs , while reduc ing GHGs by up to 90%. In addition to providing electrical power, the CEP converts heat to steam to operate medical equipment and provide heating , air conditioning and hot and cold water to the hospital. The CEP is fully compli ant with state and local air emissions standards. In 2018, Sharp opened the Copley building, which includes administrative space for SRSMG, as well as the highly complex, consolidated Sharp HealthCare Laborat ory that Consumption Analysis and Characterization of Healthcar e Facilities in the United States. Energies 2019, 12, 3775. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 42 services the entire Sharp system. This is the first Sharp building to use a fuel cell14 designed to serve the base load of the facility to operate optimally 24 hours a day, seven days a week, providing almost 90% of the building's energy needs. The fuel cell has reduced the Copley building's CO 2 emissions by more than 90% , while generating more than 3 million kilowatt -hours ( kWh) of electricity per year. In 2019, a temperature set -point guideline (an agreed upon temperature that a building will ma intain) initiative was completed throughout Sharp's facilities to standardize, optimize and enforce temperature and lighting schedules during occupied and unoccupied hours. Research indicates t hat increasing cooling temperature set -points and decreasing he ating temperature set -points by two degrees Fahrenheit reduces energy use by approximately 1% and 5%, respectively. Sharp collaborated with its community energy partners, including San Diego Ga s & Electric ( SDG&E ) and consulting firms Ecom -Energy and Altur a Associates, to develop these guidelines based on best practices for energy -efficient temperature control in hospitals. In 2013, Sharp launched an initiative to replace fluorescent light bul bs and lower - performance light emitting diode (LED) lights with next-generation, high -performance LED lights and fixtures. Retrofits were completed at all Sharp locations in FY 2021. The new LED lighting is rated to meet and exceed the requirements establi shed by California's Title 24 Building Energy Efficiency Standa rds and the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Overall, these retrofits are projected to reduce Sharp's energy use by 55%. The lighting projects completed from 2019 to 2021 are expected to save more than 6.8 million kWh in electricity p er year \u2014 enough to power more than 1,700 cars \u2014 and reduce annual CO 2 emissions by approximately 1,625 metric tons. Sharp continues to seek innovative solutions to meet the lighting needs of its customers and staff in the most cost -effective, earth -friend ly manner. Since 2013, Sharp has reduced its annual energy usage by 12.3 million k Wh and 2,950 metric tons of CO 2 through its investment in LED projects. In January 2020, SCVMC opened the newl y constructed Ocean View Tower. Th is hospital was designed acco rding to Sharp's sustainability standards and includes energy - and water -saving features , such as high -efficiency boilers; more efficient heating, ventilation and air -conditioning (HVAC) systems in non -patient care areas; and a cool roof, which saves energ y by reflecting more sunlight and absorbing less heat than standard roofs. Since the opening of the new tower in 2020, SCVMC has reduced its overall energy us e by 3%. Sharp's SRSMC Santee facility opened in September 2020 and was designed with energy - and water -saving elements , including drought tolerant landscaping, 3 4 electric vehicle chargers (EVC), parking lot solar panels, and a battery storage unit, whi ch optimizes energy management by storing energy generated from the solar panels. Th is new buildin g earned Sharp the 2020 Zero Net Energy award by the San Diego Green Building Council \u2014 a group of building industry professionals who work to promote 14 A fuel cell use s the chemical energy of hydrogen or another fuel to clean ly and efficient ly produce electric ity (Office of Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy) . Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 43 sustain able building and community practices in SDC \u2014 as well as Engineering News - Record California's 202 1 Sustainability Award of Merit for the Southern California region . In 2021, Sharp committed to installing solar photovoltaic systems at three sites to produ ce its own clean, renewable energy. The proposed solar systems across SGH, SMMC and Sharp's Spectr um system office will total more than one megawatt of solar capacity and produce over 1.8 million kWh of electricity each year \u2014 equivalent to the amount of e nergy needed to power more than 160 homes annually. SMMC participates in the San Diego Higher Op portunity Projects and Programs Retrocommissioning (HOPPs RCx), which is funded by California utility customers and administered by SDG&E. Through HOPPs RCx, qualified facilities receive a free building analysis to identify energy -saving opportunities, fin ancial incentives to implement energy -saving measu res and staff training on post -installation maintenance. HOPPs RCx projects typically reduce building energy costs by 5 % to 20% with financial returns on investment seen after less than two years , on averag e. In FY 2020, Sharp also launched an analytics -based commissioning effort for six of its most energy - intensive hospitals, medical office buildings and corporate buildings. The effort focused on improving HVAC efficiency by identifying faulty equipment, op timizing heating and cooling operations and increa sing equipment lifetime. Across the six sites, the analytics - based commissioning projects will reduce building energy use by an average of over 4.4 million kWh and save over 53,000 therms of natural gas use by FY 2023, saving Sharp nearly $1.0 million in o perating costs each year. Sharp will continue these efforts at seven additional medical office buildings between FY 2023 and FY 2024 , which is projected to further reduce annual energy consumption by an ave rage of 23%. Sharp adopted a focused water cons ervation program at all sites and remains dedicated to using water wisely . Low flow fixtures, low flow irrigation systems, water tolerant landscape and water reclamation in the facility plants are the prima ry drivers that reduce water usage throughout Sharp's facilities. To further align with this commitment, Sharp partners with Emerald Textiles for its laundry and linen services. The company operates a state -of-the-art plant that is efficiently designed to reduce utility consumption and preserve natural resources. Each year, Emerald Textiles saves an estimated 160 million gallons of water through its water filtration system, more than 466,000 kWh of electricity using energy -efficient lighting, and over 200,000 therms of gas by using energy -efficient laundry equipment. In FY 2022, Sharp was recognized by the San Diego Climate Acti on Campaign as the 100% Clean Power Champion , which is awarded to businesses, agencies and institutions that have committed to powe ring their organizations with 100% clean energy . Previously, i n 2017, Sharp received the Environmental Stewardship Award in the large business category from the B etter Business Bureau serving San Diego, Orange and Imperial counties. The award recognizes bu sinesses that increase efforts toward a more sustainable footprint and green initiatives. Also in 2017, Sharp was named San D iego's Grand Energy Champion by SDG&E in recognition of its continuous Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 44 commitment to energy efficiency. The award noted the particu lar challenges faced by health care organizations trying to conserve energy, given the need to maintain a comfortable, clean and safe environment for patients, visitors and staff 24 hours a day, seven days a week. See Table 4 for a list of Sharp's natural resource conservation efforts.

Sharp is committed to significantly reducing waste at each entity and extending the lifespan of local landfills. In FY 202 2, Sharp's waste minimization initiatives \u2014 including programs focused on recycling, don ating, composting, reprocessing and reusing \u2014 helped divert more than 3,270 tons of waste ( nearly one -third of all waste). See Table 5 for Sharp's waste diversion rates in FY 202 2. Sharp's Waste Minimization Committee provides oversight of systemwide wast e minimization initiatives. See Table 6 for specific waste minimization efforts occurring across the organization. In addition, Sharp achieved the following in waste minimization in FY 202 2: Sharp's single -waste stream recycling program diverted more than 6.5 million lbs. of trash from local la ndfills, including non -confidential paper, cardboard, exam table paper, plastic, batteries, e -Waste, aluminum cans and glass containers. Sharp collected, reprocessed and sterilized more than 59,000 lbs. of surgical instruments for further use. Reprocessed items included compression devices, electrophysiology cables, ultrasonic scalpels and more. Sharp continued to help reduce plastic water bottle waste with touchless, filtered - water refill stations at its Spectrum and Tech Way system offices, SCVMC and SRS MC sites.

Sharp continu ed to participate in SDC's Hazmat Stak eholder meetings to discuss best practices for medical waste management with other hospital leaders in SDC. In addition, drug take -back kiosks at SCHHC and SCVMC provided the community with options to properly dispose of prescription medications that are expired or no longer needed. These kiosks provide a safe, convenient and responsible means of drug disposal while providing education to the general public about the potential for prescription medication abuse. In FY 2 022, more than 150 lbs. of medications were collected through these kiosks. In 2021, SMH and SMBHWN were recognized by California's Department of Resources, Recycling and Recovery as the first hospitals to participate in the City of San Diego's food scrap s composting programs and for continui ng to engage in sustainability efforts. The material from these hospitals represents more than 5% of the hospitals' overall waste diversion. Sharp was selected by the City of San Diego's Environmental Services Depar tment as a Recycler of the Year in the 2020 Business Waste Reduction and Recycling Awards Program. In 2017, Sharp was recognized by C alifornia Resource Recovery Association as the Outstanding Recycling Program for its innovative waste minimization initiati ves.

In collaboration with it s food service partner, Sodexo, Sharp remains an innovator and early adopter of sustainable and healthy food practices that enhance the health of patients, employees, the community and the environment. Sharp's Food and Nutrition Best Health Committee suppo rts these efforts by promoting food sustainability awareness throughout the health care system and within the greater San Diego community. Sharp's Mindful food program is a key component of the organization's effort to increase the consumption of healthy foods in its cafeterias while r educing its carbon footprint. The Mindful initiative includes the following elements: reduced meat consumption through the promotion of Meatless Mondays; increased purchases of beef and poultry Waste Minimization Project Entity SCHHC SCVMC SGH System Offices SHP SMH / SMBHWN SMV/ SMC SRSMG Electronic and Pharmaceutical Waste Recycling Events Composting and Organic Waste Recycling (Green Waste) Recycle Bins Distribution Repurposing of Unused Medical Supp lies and Equipment Reusable Sharps Containers Single -serve Paper Napkins and Plastic Cutlery Dispensers Surgical Instrument Reprocessing Replacement of Bottled Water with Spa Water Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 49 raised without the routine use of antibiotics; menus that high light wellness options ; increased use of locally sourced, fresh, organic and sustainable food; food composting; increased recycling activities; the promotion of sugarless beverages; the use of post - consumer recycled packaging solutions; and participation i n Community Supported Agriculture \u2014 an alternative model of agriculture that more closely connects food producers and consumers by allowing consumers to subscribe to the harvest of a particular farm. In FY 2020, Sharp became the first health system in the country to implement the new Sodexo Nourish menu for inpatients, which is based on the principles of culinary genomics \u2014 the preparation of food according to human genetics to optimize long -term health. This innovative, holi stic menu was inspired by research performed in Blue Zones \u2014 regions of the world where a higher -than-expected number of people live longer lives. Currently available at SMH, SMBHWN, SCHHC and SCVMC, the Nourish menu offers a variety of delicious, nutritio us and visually appetizing meals. The menu has been strategically designed to expand Sharp's understanding of nutrition and , ideally, change the way patients, staff and visitors think about food. Further, the menu specifically addresses prevalent diseases in the U.S. that may be mitigated through food interventions, including diabetes, CVD and obesity. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, up to 40% of food produced in the U.S. goes to waste. Sodexo teams at SC VMC and SMH use the Leanpath platform, food recovery and composting partnerships to meet the goal of reducing food waste by 50% by 2030 . Leanpath provides an advanced food waste tracking software system to help kitchen teams measure food prior to discarding or donating to prevent pre -consu mer food waste (waste generated in the kitchen) and post -consumer food waste (food thrown away by the consumer ) from entering landfills. In addition, the use of self -audit checklists help s kitchen teams across the system reduce waste between food preparati on and cleanup. In 2012, SMMC became the first hospital campus to participate in the City of San Diego's food scraps composting program. Currently , SMMC and SGH participate in food waste composting efforts . Through these programs, food waste at these Shar p locations is processed into a rich compost product, which is provided to residents at no charge for up to two cubic yards. The compost offers several benefits , including improving the health and fertility of soil, reducing the need to purchase commercial fertilizers, increasing the soil's ability to retain water and helping the environment by recycling valuable organic materials. In FY 202 2, Sharp's composting programs diverted approximately 11 tons of waste from landfills. In FY 202 2, Sharp's use of imperfect produce in its kitchens \u2014 produce that is aesthetically less -than-perfect yet still nutritious and usable \u2014 prevented more than 8,100 lbs. of food from going to waste. SCHHC, SMH and SMV also continued to operate the first county -approved, hospit al-based organic gardens. Produce from the gardens is used in the hospital cafeterias, but not served in patient rooms . In addition, Sharp is in the process of eliminating oil fryers in its kitchens, with healthier methods of Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 50 food preparation already in us e at SGH and SCHHC. Further, in FY 202 2, SGH and SCHHC recycled nearly 5,150 lbs. of used cooking oil. Sharp is an active member of the Community Health Improvement Partners Farm to Institution Center's Nutrition in Healthcare Leadership Team. The group, which represents more than a dozen SDC hospitals and health care systems, collaborates to ensure that all food and beverages served in county hospitals are healthy, fresh, affordable and produced in a manner that supports the local economy, environment and community. As a recipient of the 2018 EMIES UnWasted Food award, Sharp was recognized by the San Diego Food System Alliance for its collaboration as an innovator and early adopter of food waste prevention and recovery programs. The award honors the 1996 federal Bill Emerson Good Samaritan Food Donation Act, which encourages food donation to nonprofit organizations by protecting donors from liability. Sharp previously earned this award in 2016. Sharp and Sodexo remain committed to food sustainability eff orts that improve both individual and environmental health. Sharp's sustainable food initiatives are outlined in Table 7 .

Sharp's Commuter Solutions Subcommittee develops innovative and accessible programs and marketing campaigns to educate employees about the benefits of ride sharing and other environmentally friend ly modes of transportation. Sharp's ongoing efforts to promote alternative commuter choices have led to its recognition as a San Diego Association o f Governments (SANDAG) iCommute Diamond Award recipient between 2001 and 2010, and from 2013 to 202 2 (platin um tier) . A cooperative effort between SANDAG and the 511 transportation information service, iCommute is the Transportation Demand Management progr am for the San Diego region and encourages use of transportation alternatives to help reduce traffic congest ion and GHG emissions. Sharp replaced high fuel -consuming cargo vans with economy Ford transit vehicles, which save approximately five miles per ga llon. In addition, Sharp's employee parking lots offer carpool and motorcycle parking spaces. Sharp was the first health care system in SDC to offer EVCs to support the creation of a national EVC infrastructure and help reduce carbon emissions and dependen ce on petroleum. As part of the nationwide Electric Vehicle Project, Sharp has installed 80 EVCs at its corp orate office, the Copley building, SCVMC, and some SRSMC sites. Since January 2022, Sharp's EVCs have generated the energy equivalent of over 7,400 gallons of gasoline. Sharp is in the process of expanding its network of EV Cs in the parking structures at its Spectrum system office, SGH and the SMMC campus. Sharp encourages employees to participate in commuter alternatives, such as public transi t, carpooling, vanpooling, biking, walking and telecommuting. Through participat ion in SANDAG's iCommute program, employees are offered ride-sharing matches for their commute based on work schedule, departure location and destination. In addition, Sharp ha s enrolled in SANDAG's Guaranteed Ride Home program , which provides commuters who car pool, vanpool, take an express bus, ride the Coaster, or bike to work three or more times a week with a taxi or a rental car in case of an emergency or becoming stranded a t work. Sharp employees can also purchase discounted monthly bus passes. Employees ca n monitor the cost and carbon savings from their alternative commuting methods by logging their miles in an internal tracking tool on Sharp's intranet. Sharp provides bik e racks at its facilities as well as offers a bicycle commuter benefit, which provide s employees who bike to work up to $20 per month to use toward qualified costs associated with bicycle purchase, improvement, repair and storage. In addition, Sharp employ ees participate d in SANDAG 's 2022 Bike to Work Day in May, which encouraged San Diega ns to commute by bike to work for a chance to win prizes . Participants were encouraged to stop for refreshments and a free t -shirt at one of SANDAG's many pitstops around the county, including SCHHC, SCVMC and Sharp 's Spectrum system office location . Appro ximately 160 community members visited Sharp's three pitstops throughout the event. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 52 Furthering its commitment to improve commuting options for employees, Sharp supplies and supports the hardware and software for more than 1,000 employees who are able to efficiently and effectively telecommute. During FY 2022, Sharp granted more than 700 new employee remote access requests due to an emergency work-from-home initiative brough t on by COVID -19. Sharp HR also approved more than 800 permanent work from home requests for telecommuting employees during 2022. Telecommuting employees work in areas that do not require an on -site presence, such as IT, transcription and HR. Sharp also of fers compressed work schedules to eligible full -time employees, which enables them to complete the standard 80-hour biweekly work requirement in less than 10 workdays. Telecommuting and compressed work schedules help Sharp reduce CO 2 emissions, lower commu ting costs and enhance employee morale. Community Education and Outreach Sharp actively educates employees and the community about its sustainability efforts. Sharp's ongoing community education and outreach initiatives are highlighted in Table 8. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 53 Table 8: Environmental Community Education and Outrea ch by Sharp HealthCare Entity Emergency and Disaster Preparedness Sharp contributes to the health and safety of the San Diego community through essential emergency and disaster planning activities and services. Sha rp's disaster preparedness team provides education to staff, community members and community health professionals, as well as collaborates with numerous state and local organizations to prepare the community for a potential emergency or disaster. In FY 20 22, the disast er preparedness team offered training programs to first responders and community health care providers throughout SDC. Programs included : a standardized, on -scene federal emergency management training for hospital leaders called National Inci dent Managemen t System/Incident Command System/Hospital Community SMH/ SMBHWN SMV/ SMC SRSMG America Recycles Day Bike to Work Day Earth Week Activities Environmental Policy Green Team No Smoking Policy Organic Farmer's Market Organic Gardens Prescription Drug Recycling Kiosks Recycli ng Education Ride Share Promotion Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 54 Incident Command System ; and a training focused specifically on Hospital Incident Command System , an incident management system that can be used by hospitals to manage threats, planned events or emerg encies. A trai ning course was also offered on the WebEOC (Web Emergency Operations Center) crisis information management system, which provides real -time information sharing between health care systems and other agencies during a disaster. Traditionally he ld in-person, these trainings continued to take place virtually due to the COVID -19 pandemic . In addition, in FY 2022 Sharp partnered with the County of San Diego \u2014 including the Emergency Medical Services, Public Health Preparedness and Response, and Me dical Operatio ns Center branches \u2014 as well as other regional health care partners in two disaster preparedness exercises. The San Diego Medical and Health Facility Evacuation Preparation Full Scale Exercise tested the San Diego region's ability to respond and evacuate p atients in the event of a large -scale earthquake. Sharp conduct ed a drill at each of its acute care hospitals and SRSMC locations and represented health care operations on behalf of the exercise planning committee. Further, Sharp served on th e planning team for the San Diego County Medical and Health Facility Burn Surge Table -Top Exercise, a virtual drill to test the region's ability to respond to a surge of patients requiring burn care. Through these countywide exercises, Sharp shared best pr actices to better prepare community partners to collaboratively respond to a disaster. Members of Sharp's disaster leadership team donate their time to various state and local organizations and committees. Due to the ongoing impact of the COVID -19 pandem ic, meetings continue d to operate virtually in FY 202 2. Groups included the County of San Diego Emergency Medical Care Committee, the California Hospital Association (CHA) Emergency Management Advisory Committee, the California Department of Public Health' s (CDPH) Joint Advisory Committee, the Ronald McDonald House Operations Committee , the CDPH Statewide Medical and Health Exercise Workgroup , and the San Diego International Airport Aviation Security and Public Safety Department. Sharp's disaster leadershi p also participated in the County of San Diego Healthcare Disaster Coalition, a multi -agency group of representatives who assist the county in improving mitigation, preparedness, response and recovery activities during emergencies and disasters. As part of this coalition, Sharp's disaster preparedness team participated in the Hospital Preparedness Program (HPP) budget, decontamination and SharePoint subcommittees. The HPP budget subcommittee strives to improve readiness by building supply caches of readily available health care supplies that can be used during a disaster. In addition, the decontamination subcommittee aims to standardize equipment and processes for hospitals, while the SharePoint committee is designed to build a coalition SharePoint site to provide members with disaster health care education and information. Through participation in the U.S. DHHS Public Health Emergency HPP grant, Sharp created the Sharp HealthCare HPP Disaster Preparedness Partnership. The Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 55 partnership includes local hospit als, health clinics and other health providers, and provides resources, trainings and information to prepare non -hospital entities in SDC for a collaborative response to an emergency or disaster. The partnership seeks to continually identify and develop re lationships with health care entities, nonprofit organizations, law enforcement, military installations and other organizations that serve SDC and are located near partner health care facilities. In FY 2022, the COVID -19 pandemic continued to reinforce t he importance of Sharp's existing relationships with other hospital systems in SDC, as well as with the Hospital Association of San Diego and Imperial Counties (HASD&IC) and CHA. As part of a workgroup established to collaboratively address publ ic health t hreats , Sharp participated in ongoing virtual meetings with Scripps Health, Palomar Health, UC San Diego Health, Kaiser Permanente San Diego, HASD&IC and CHA to share best practices in patient care; strategies to ensure provider safety and well -being; and plans for a continuously successful disaster response that aligns with current public health guidelines. Currently, t he group is formalizing a cybersecurity readiness plan for San Diego hospitals and other health care delivery systems to effecti vely respon d in the event of a cybersecurity incident. Further, Sharp's disaster leadership collaboratively steers t he Highly Infectious Disease Advisory Committee . This committee prepares the Sharp workforce to care for patients infected with COVID -19 and other em erging infectious diseases. This committee remains in close contact with local, state and national health officials to report and monitor cases and secure sustainable supply chains for necessary equipment and supplies . The Highly Infectious Dise ase Advisor y Committee also disseminate s relevant guidance and recommendations to Sharp's workforce , community partners and patients. Sharp supports the safety efforts of California and the C ounty of San Diego through maintenance and storage of a federal ly funded decontamination trailer at SGH to be used in response to an event requiring mass decontamination. Although the trailer is strategically located at SGH to respond to the needs of East County, it can be relocated elsewhere in the event of an emerge ncy. Additi onally, all Sharp hospitals are prepared for an emergency with backup water supplies that will last up to 96 hours in the event of an interruption to the system's normal water supply. The ongoing impact of COVID -19 has demonstrated more clearly than ever the ways in which a global pandemic can impact public health in SDC at any time. Sharp will continue to collaborate with other health care systems, first responders and community partners to deliver uninterrupted care in the face of an emergency or disaste r. Sharp Equality Alliance Sharp recognizes the power of bringing individual differences, cultures and backgrounds together to create a stronger whole. Working as a diverse team strengthens Sharp's ability to become the best place to work, practice medi cine and receive care. In 2014, a network of Sharp employees formed the SEA to serve as a Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 56 catalyst for Sharp's dedication to embracing diversity and celebrating equality. The SEA works to increase awareness of diverse cultures within Sha rp's workforce, foc us on the influence of employees' individual backgrounds and strengths and develop partnerships to achieve health equity across the Sharp system and the San Diego community. The SEA accomplishes these goals by engaging Sharp's workforce in education and dialogue around diversity and equity, building relationships with the outside community through employee resource groups and participating in community events to promote understanding, inclusivity and acceptance. The SEA encourages diver sity awareness thro ugh educational articles, videos and other resources that emphasize the importance of mutual respect in the workplace and appreciation for each team member's unique talents and perspectives. In addition, the SEA promotes treatment of eac h Sharp patient in a dignified and sensitive manner that responds to individual cultural health beliefs, preferences and communication needs to ensure health equity. The SEA also provides resources and recommendations to engage Sharp leadership in the proc ess of ensuring inc lusive values within the organization. Each Sharp entity has a designated SEA chapter, leader and executive sponsor to help fulfill this work. Since 2017, the SEA has hosted regular opportunities for Sharp employees and Sharp - affiliated physicians to lear n and engage in meaningful conversations about current topics regarding DEIB . Titled SEA Breakfast Forum - A Health Equity Series, FY 2022 forum themes included: Providing Affirming Care for LGBTQ+ Patients ; The Impact of Faith and Spirituality on the Heal th Care Journey ; The Clinician Influence: Emotional Communication With Patients and Stigmatizing Language in Patient Medical Records ; Procreativ e Equality; as well as Health Equity and the Sharp Health Plan. Prior forums have focused on topics addressing c aregiver burnout during the pandemic, homelessness, family dynamics of addiction, food insecurity, mental health, racial and gender health equit y, stigma , and veterans' health. Additionally, Breakfast Forum attendees may obtain CME credits for their attend ance. In addition, the SEA and Sharp Employee Assistance Program (EAP) host ongoing Safe Speak support sessions to provide Sharp employees and Sharp -affiliated physicians with a safe space to connect with peers, speak openly, find support, brainstorm solutions, and share their unique experiences related to current events (e.g., racial, societal, cultural, and political unrest). Safe Speak began in June 2020 as a way to give Black colleagues a safe, confidential space to come together and have their voices heard following national events and protests surrounding racial injustice. Later, Safe Speak expanded to support the voices and concerns of other ethnic communities experiencing violence and hate, including those of Asian American, Pacific Islander, Musli m and Jewish heritage. Further, Safe Speak sessions were held for Sharp team member s of all political backgrounds to discuss feelings or concerns related to the unique experiences of minorities; chronic grief and multifaceted trauma; the outcome of the 202 0 presidential election; employees experiencing feelings of social and political uncertainty ; stress and fatigue related to COVID -19; and team members who identify as LGBTQ+. Attendance is limited during Safe Speak sessions to support confidentiality. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 57 The SEA also continued to offer Current Conversations in FY 2022. Launched in summer 2020, Current Conversations is an online forum moderated by an SEA leader who facilitates educational and engaging conversations with expert speakers about current topics su rrounding identity. Typically, a Current Conversations event consists of an expert speaker presentation, followed by a question -and-answer session. Current Conversations welcomes Sharp employees, Sharp -affiliated physicians and Sharp volunteers to particip ate in moderated virtual discussions on topics including race, ethnicity, gender, r eligion, culture and more. Unlike Safe Speak, participation in Current Conversations is unlimited and non -confidential. In FY 2022, Current Conversations sessions explored m indfulness, spirituality, and world religions such as Christianity and Judaism. Previous Current Conversations themes focused on the experiences of people who identify as Asian American and Pacific Islander, White/European American, Native American and In digenous , LGBTQ+, Hispanic/Latino/Latinx, individuals who practice Islam , and Black , Indigenous and People of Color ; the experiences of individuals with autism, neurodiversity, and mood disorders; those living with obsessive - compulsive disorder and attenti on-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; as well as individuals affected by post -traumati c stress disorder or trauma. The SEA continuously identifies and creates opportunities to demonstrate Sharp's commitment to DEIB . Since its inception, the SEA has represent ed Sharp at numerous public events . In FY 2022 these events included San Diego Pride and the 2022 NAMIWalks Your Way San Diego & Imperial Counties . In addition, SEA generated numerous internal communications around celebrations that promote equality and acceptance for a variety of communities , including Juneteenth, Asian Pacific Islander Heritage Month , Hispanic Heritage Month, and Jewish American Heritage Month. In FY 2022, SEA leaders developed programs that support and engage at -risk youth. This includ ed the Sharp Like Me program, a mento rship and career pathway partnership with the San Diego Unified School District's College Career and Technical Education Department to educate at-risk youth about opportunities in the health care field. Through Sharp Li ke Me, SEA and Sharp volunteers used a goals -based curriculum to assist students at Lincoln and Clairemont high schools with navigating next steps to their desired health care career s. In addition, in FY 2022, SEA assisted with a fundraiser to support Walk With Me Impact, a youth mentorship p rogram for at -risk male youth . The SEA plans to continue its partnerships with both programs in FY 2023. In FY 2022, through SEA leadership's efforts, each of Sharp's seven hospitals were designated as LGBTQ+ Healthca re Equality Leader s in the HRC Foundation's 2022 HEI, a national benchmarking tool that evaluates health care facilities' policies and practices related to the equity and inclusion of LGBTQ+ patients, visitors and employees. Previously , the SEA spearheaded the creation and passage of th e new LGBTQ+ Patient Care policy systemwide. This policy provides rules and guidance for providing care to the LGBTQ+ community in San Diego and within Sharp . Additional achievements included Sharp's systemwide public -facing statement of support for LGBTQ+ equality legislation; the development of hiring practices for the Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 58 LGBTQ+ community; the creation and public distribution of Sharp's LGBTQ+ graphic; and the modification of Sharp hospitals' electronic health record platform t o permit the use of a patient's preferred name and gender identity within hospital data systems. In the coming year, the SEA plans to continue enhanc ing Sharp's employee diversity training to further strengthen cultural competency, inclusive thinking and workplace sensitivity. The SEA also continues to develop specialized continuing education opportunities for clinicians to improve care for Sharp's LGBTQ+ patient population, including free training opportunities through the HRC Foundation. Further, the SEA is looking into creating a group that focuses on fulfilling all of the requirements to maintain LGBTQ+ Health Care Leadership designation with the HRC Foundation's HEI. Additionally, the SEA hopes to collaborate with Sharp University to infuse DEIB in employee education a nd training materials. Lastly , the SEA plans to continue expanding partnerships with other departments within Sharp, develop relationships with non -Sharp entities that align with SEA efforts, as well as create formal resource groups betwe en the SEA and ext ernal community groups.

Costs for patients paid through th e Medicare program on a prospective basis also include payments to third parties related to the specific population. 19 Charity care and bad debt reflect the unreimbursed costs of providing services to patients without the ability to pay for servi ces at the time the services were rendered. 20 \"Vulnerable populations\" means any population that is exposed to medical or financial risk by virtue of being uninsured, underinsured, or eligible for Medi -Cal, Medicare, California Children's Services Program, or county in digent programs. 21 Unreimbursed costs may include an hourly rate for labor and benefits p lus costs for supplies, materials and other purchased services. Any offsetting revenue (such as fees, grants or external donations ) is deducted from the costs of pro viding services. Unreimbursed costs were estimated by each department responsible for providing the program or service.

Great joy comes from making a difference for others. \u2014 Alison Fleury, Senior Vice President of Business Development, Sharp HealthCare For more than 25 years, Sharp HealthCare (Sharp) has based its community benefit planning on findings from its triennial Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) process. Sharp uses its CHNA findings in combination with the expertise in programs and services o f each Sharp hospita l, as well as knowledge of the populations and communities served by those hospitals, to provide a foundation for community benefit program planning and implementation. This section describes Sharp's most recent CHNA process and finding s, which were comple ted in September 2022. Sharp HealthCare 2022 Community Health Needs Assessments Sharp has been a longtime partner in the process of identifying and responding to the health needs of the San Diego community. Since 1995, Sharp has parti cipated in a countywide collaborative that includes a broad range of hospitals, health care organizati ons and community agencies to conduct a triennial CHNA that identifies and prioritizes health needs for San Diego County (SDC). In addition, to address th e requirements for not -for-profit hospitals under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Shar p has developed CHNAs for each of its individually licensed hospitals since 2013. This process gathers both hospital data and the perspectives of communit y health organizations and residents to identify and prioritize health and social needs for residents across the county, with a special focus on community members experiencing challenges to health equity. Further, the process seeks to highlight community h ealth needs that Sharp hospitals could impact through programs, services and collaboration. For the 2022 CHNA process, Sharp actively participated in a collaborative CHNA effort led by the Hospital Association of San Diego and Imperial Counties (HASD&IC). The complete HASD&IC 2022 CHNA is available for public viewing and download at https://hasdic.org/chna/ . Its methodology and findings significantly informed the process and findings of Sharp's individual hospital CH NAs, thus, both CHNA processes are described throughout this se ction. The HASD&IC 2022 CHNA was implemented and managed by a standing CHNA Committee comprised of representatives from seven hospitals and health systems: Grossmont Healthcare District Kaiser Foundation Hospital - San Diego Rady Children's Hospital - San Diego Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 73 Scripps Health ( vice chair) Sharp HealthCare ( chair) Tri-City Medical Center UC San Diego Health To develop its individual hospital CHNAs, Sharp analyzed its own hospital -specific da ta and contracted separately with the Institute for Public Health (IPH) at San Diego State University (SDSU) to conduct community engagement activities expressly for the patients, providers and community members served by Sharp. Sharp develops and publicly reports CHNAs for the following Sharp hospital entities: Sharp Chula Vista Medical Center Sharp Coronado Hospital and Healthcare Center Sharp Grossmont Hospital Sharp Me morial Hospital (SMH) Sharp McDonald Center Sharp Mesa Vista Hospital In accordance with federal regulations, the SMH 2022 CHNA also includes needs identified for communities served by Sharp Mary Birch Hospital for Women & Newborns, as the two hospitals s hare a license and report all utilization and financial data as a single entity to Ca lifornia's Department of Health Care Access and Information (HCAI) (formerly California's Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development). This section describes th e general methodology employed for Sharp's 2022 CHNAs, including applicable elements CHNA processes were designed to build off the findings from the 2019 CHNA processes. With these insights, the CHNA Committee developed the following objectives: Identify, und erstand and prioritize the health and social needs of SDC residents, especially those community members served by Sharp. Provide a greater understanding o f barriers to health improvement in SDC and inform and guide local hospitals in the development of pr ograms and strategies that address identified community health needs. Build on and strengthen community partnerships established through the 2019 CHNA proc esses. Explore the current impact of COVID -19 (coronavirus disease 2019) on the community health need s identified by the 2019 CHNA. Obtain deeper feedback from and about communities in SDC facing inequities. Align with national best practices around CHNA development and implementation, including the integration of health conditions with social determinant s of health (SDOH). Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 74 Community Defined For the purposes of the collaborative as well as Sharp's 2022 CHNAs, the study area is the entire County of Sa n Diego. More than three million people live in socially and ethnically diverse SDC. Information on key dem ographics, socioeconomic factors, access to care, health behaviors and the physical environment can be found in the full HASD&IC 2022 CHNA report at: https://hasdic.org/chna/ . Recognizing that health needs differ ac ross the region and that socioeconomic factors impact health outcomes, Sharp's 2022 CHNA process used the Dignity H ealth and IBM Watson Health Community Need Index (CNI)22 to identify communities within its service areas that experience greater health inequ ities. The CNI uses demographic and economic statistics to provide a \"CNI score\" for every populated ZIP code in the U.S. The CNI score is an average of the following five socioeconomic barrier scores for each community: 1. Income Barriers 2. Cultural Barriers 3. Educational Barriers 4. Insurance Barriers 5. Housing Barriers CNI scores range from 1.0 to 5.0, with a score of 1.0 indicating a ZIP code with the least need/low health inequity (light blue in Figure 8 ), and a score of 5.0 for a ZIP code with the most need/hi gh health inequity (dark green in Figure 8 ). Figure 8 below presents a CNI map of SDC. This information was used to collect input from specific San Diego communities with health disparities and to guide the exploration of Sharp's community programs and s ervices within those communities. 22 The Dignity Health and IBM Watson Community Need Index (CNI) was discontinued on January 31, 2023. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 75 Figure 8: San Diego County, CNI Map23 Methodology For the HASD&IC 2022 CHNA, quantitative analyses of publicly available data provided an overview of critical health issues across SDC, while qualitative an alyses of community feedback provided improved understanding of the experiences and needs of San Diegans. The CHNA Co mmittee reviewed these analyses and applied a pre - determined set of criteria to them to prioritize the top health needs in SDC. This proces s is represented in Figure 9 below. 23 Truven Health Analytics, 20 22; Insurance Coverage Estimates, 20 22; The Nielson Company, 20 22; and CNI, 2022. Map produced by Sharp Strategic Planning Department, 20 22. Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 76 Figure 9: HASD&IC 2022 CHNA \u2014 Process Map Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit Plan and Report Page 77 Quantitative/Secondary Data Quantitative data were used for three primary purposes: 1. Describe the SDC community 2. Plan and design the community engagement process 3. Facili tate the \"prioritization process\" \u2014 identifying the most serious community health needs of SDC residents who face inequities Quantitative data included: HCAI limited data sets, 2017 -2019 accessed via SpeedTrack\u00a924 CNI23 Public Health Alliance of Southern California Healthy Places Index (HPI) National and statewide data sets including SDC mortality and morbidity data and data related to SDOH The HPI and the CNI were used to identify the most under -resourced ge ographic areas. This information helped guide the community engagement process, inclu ding selecting communities from which to solicit input and developing relevant and meaningful engagement topics and questions. The following reports and dashboards from t he County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency were also used: County of San Diego Community Health Statistics Health Disparities Executive Summary Report25 Racial Equity: Framework and Outcomes Brief San Diego County Self - Sufficiency Standard, H ousehold with Two Adults, One Preschool - Age Child and One Sch ool-Age Child, 2021 Overdose Data to Action (OD2A) Health Equity Dashboard Series: Racial Equity Dashboards San Diego County Self - Sufficiency Standard Dashboard COVID -19 in San Diego County Dashb oard LGBTQ+ Health and Well -Being Dashboard 24 SpeedTrack's Population Health Decision Support Platform was used to export emergency department and inpatient hospita l discharge data. 25 County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency, Public Health Services, Community Health Statistics Unit (2022), Exploring Health Disparities in San Diego County: Executive Summary . Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 78 In addition , Sharp's 2022 CHNA process included strategic analysis by Sharp's Clinical Analytics team of internal hospital and clinic data to explore observations and trends among Sharp's patient population, p articularly related to the impact of t he COVID -19 pandemic. Data came from a variety of sources, including the Cerner Millennium electronic medical record, hospital and clinic claims data, managed care enrollment and clinical registries. Key service -line s takeholders in behavioral health and o ncology, along with Sharp's Emergency Department Collaborative and Clinical Effectiveness department also participated in the process to ensure the accuracy of data sources and metrics. Sharp also used SpeedTrack's C alifornia Universal Patient Informatio n Discovery application to analyze HCAI hospital discharge data, which provided insight on top diagnoses, trends and demographic characteristics among both inpatients and individuals who visited its emergency departmen ts during calendar year 2020. This analysis reinforced key themes identified in the Sharp and HASD&IC 2022 CHNA processes. In addition, Sharp used the CNI to identify the communities in its service area s experiencing health inequities. This included over laying hospital dischar ge data for specific health conditions on top of CNI data to analyze the connection between those health conditions and under -resourced communities in SDC. Community Engagement The goal of the HASD&IC 2022 CHNA community engagemen t process was to solicit input from a wide range of stakeholders, so the sample was as representative of those facing inequities in SDC as possible. A total of 841 individuals participated in HASD&IC 2022 CHNA community engagement activities. Please see Figure 10 for a summary of community engagement participation in the HASD&IC 2022 CHNA. Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 79 Figure 10: HASD&IC 2022 CHNA \u2014 Community Engagement Activity Summary In addition, Sharp conducted community engagement activities specifi cally for the community members it serves. Sharp collected input through three electronic surveys: 1. A survey for select Sharp health care providers, particularly those professionals who s erve patients with health equity challenges.

Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 81 Prioritization of 2022 Community Needs The CHNA Committee collectively reviewed the quantitative and qualitative data and findings. Several criteria were applied to the data to determine the hi ghest priority health needs in SDC. These crit eria included: the severity of the need , the magnitude/scale of the need , disparities or inequities and change over time. Those health conditions and SDOH that met the largest number of criteria were then selec ted as top community needs. As the HASD&IC 20 22 CHNA process included robust representation from the communities served by Sharp, this prioritization process was replicated for Sharp's 2022 CHNAs. Findings Figure 11 below illustrates the top community needs identified by Sharp's 2022 CHNA process (in alphabetical order). Figure 1 1: Sharp 2022 CHNA Top Community Needs28 The graphic demonstrates how each component of the findings \u2014 the top identified community needs, the foundational challenges, and the key underlying themes \u2014 impact s one another. In particular, the foundational challenges (health disparities and workforce shortages) and underlying themes (stigma and trauma) interact with each 28 The findings of the H ospital Association of San Diego & Imperial Counties' 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA ) process were identical to Sharp's 2022 CHNA findings, wit h the exception of Maternal and Prenatal Care, Including High -Risk Pregnancy. Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 82 other to amplify the identified community needs as well a s disrupt efforts that advance health equity and improve community well -being. These findings were also supported through both the quantitative analysis and community engagement activities conducted as part of Sharp's 2022 CHNA s. In additi on, Maternal & Prenatal Care, including High -Risk Pregnancy, was also identified as a community health need by Sharp's 2022 CHNAs. Community Recommendations During qualitative data collection, HASD&IC 2022 CHNA community engagement participants were aske d, \"What are th e most important things that hospitals and health systems could do to improve health and well -being in our community?\" Overwhelmingly, respondents agreed that there is a critical need to help patients navigate available services that will he lp improve thei r health and well -being. In both the interviews and the surveys, suggestions that centered around improved patient care rose to the top. Most responses fell into four categories: navigation and support, culturally appropriate care, workfor ce development and community collaboration. See Table 14 for the types of recommendations identified by HASD&IC's community engagement participants. Table 14: HASD&IC 2022 CHNA - Community Recommendations for Hospitals and Health Systems to Improve Community Health and Well-Being HASD&IC 2022 CHNA COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS Provide Navigation & Support to Patients Connect patients to services that will improve their health and well-being Help patients understand and use health coverage Help patients coordina te their health services Help patients apply for health coverage or other benefits Help patients pay for their health care bills Provide Culturally Appropriate Care to Patients Ensure that a patient's care meets their needs Provide culturally appropriate health care in more languages Train hospital staff on biases Workforce Development Diversify the health care workforce Hire more doctors, nurses, and other health care professionals Create more health care job opportunities and career pathways Communit y Collaboration Collaborate with community groups and schools Provide health education Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 83 In addition, recommendations from Sharp's provider and HR surveys facilitated by the IPH centered around providing increased connection and support for community members , including more follow -up calls, home visits, and support for caregivers; enabling safe patient visitation during COVID -19; and raising awareness about and expanding available resources. In addition, most respondents believed telehealth to be potenti ally beneficial to patients. Respondents also emphasized the importance of addressing employee well -being and reducing turnover. Their recommendations focused on improving communication, work -life balance, compensation, new graduate programs and the hiring process. Further, respondents expressed interest in employee educational opportunities focused on care for the senior community , defining and applying cultural humility , and implicit/unconscious bias and its impact on decision making. Results indicated that efforts must be made to increase the availability of behavioral health care providers and improve access to behavioral health care. It was also recommended to create more community -based behavioral health programs and offer services in patients' prima ry languages. Similar to Sharp's provider and HR surveys, Sharp Insight Community Survey participants believed telehealth to be beneficial. Participant feedback also reve aled that more could be done to promote community awareness about Sharp programs and services among certain populations within SDC. Community Assets to Respond to Identified Needs San Diego's rich service ecosystem includes community -based organizations, government agencies, hospital and health systems, federally qualified health centers and other community members and organizations that seek opportunities to collaborate to improve the health of San Diegans. This service ecosystem is engaged in addressing all health needs identified by this assessment. Community Resources in San Diego Co unty 2-1-1 is an important community resource and information hub. Through its 24/7 phone service and online database, it helps connect individuals with community, health and disaster services. Recognizing that available programs and services are continuo usly changing, we encourage community members to access the most available, current data through 2 -1-1. In addition to connecting individuals to community services over the phone, 2 -1-1 also manages the Community Information Exchange (CIE). The CIE is a network composed of approximately 130 health, social and government organizations coordinating care through a shared technology platform and data integration. Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 84 Health Care Facilities in San Diego County HCAI is an excellent resource for detailed inform ation on every health care facility licensed in California. The following data is available on the Healthcare Facility Attributes Sharp CHNA Community Guide provides a user -friendly resource to learn about Sharp's triennial CHNA process es and findings, as well as strategies Sharp employs to address identified nee ds. In addition, the Sharp CHNA Community Guide provides a direct link for community members to provide feedback on Sharp's CHNA process. Sharp's most recent CHNA Community Guide i publicly available Sharp's website at: https://www.sharp.com/about/community/community -benefits/health -needs - assessments.cfm . An updated Sharp CHNA Community Guide detailing th e process and findings of Sharp's 2022 CHNAs will be available in 2023. Next Steps for the CHNA Sharp is committed to the health and well -being of its community, and the findings of Sharp's 2022 CHNAs will help inform the activities and services provided by Sharp to improve the health of its communit y members. These programs are detailed in Sharp hospitals' fiscal year (FY) 2023 -FY 2026 Implementation Strategies, which at: http://www.sharp. com/about/community/health -needs - assessments.cfm . Sharp will continue to work with HASD&IC and IPH t o develop and implement Phase 2 of the 2022 CHNA. Phase 2 will focus on continued engagement of community partners to analyze and improve the CHNA process , as well as the hospital implementation strategies that address the 2022 CHNA findings. Thus, the CHN A process will evolve to meet the needs of our community members and support the work of our community partners who also address those identified needs. S harp will also take a closer look at the findings that emerged during the collaborative 2022 CHNA proc ess, but for which the nature of Sharp's community engagement surveys provided limited opportunity for feedback \u2014 particularly Child & Youth Well -Being an d Community Safety. Sharp will explore strategies to gather feedback on these needs through future com munity engagement processes . Further, tools such as the CNI, will be used to continue to identify gaps in community resources and provide insight into fur ther program development. In addition, Sharp hospitals, medical groups and health plans will continu e advancing data integration and community referral efforts through partnership with 2 -1-1's CIE by expanding upon shared data capabilities , consistent tr acking and robust reporting regarding SDOH . Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 85 The findings of Sharp's 2022 CHNAs help inform and guide the programs and services provided to improve the health of community members and are a critical component of Sharp's community benefit report process, ou tlined below. Ongoing Commitment to Collabo ration Underscoring Sharp's ongoing commitment to collaboration in addressing community health priorities and improve the health of San Diegans, Sharp executive leadership, operational experts and other staff a re actively engaged in the national American Hospital Association, Association for Community Health Improvement, California Hospital Association, HASD&IC, and a variety of local collaboratives including but not limited to the San Diego Regional Chamber of Commerce, San Diego Economic Development Coun cil, 2-1-1 and the CIE. Steps Completed to Prepare Sharp's Community Benefit Plan and Report On an annual basis, each Sharp hospital performs the following steps in the preparation of its Community Benefit Pla n and Report: Establishes and/or reviews hos pital-specific objectives , taking into account results of the entity CHNA and evaluation of the entity's service area and expertise/services provided to the community Verifies the necessity of an ongoing focus on identified community needs or adds newly identified community needs Reports on activities conducted in the prior FY \u2014 FY 2022 Report of Activities Develops a plan for the upcoming FY, including specific steps to be undertaken \u2014 FY 2023 Plan Reports a nd categorizes the economic value of community benefit provided in FY 2022 , according to the framework specifically identified in California Senate Bill 697 Reviews and approves a community benefit plan Posts th e Community Benefit Plan and Report on Shar p's website (sharp.com) for public viewing and download availability Distributes the Community Benefit Plan and Report Executive Summary to community stakeholders, members of the Sharp Board of Directors and each of the Sharp hospital boards of directors Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 86 Shares the Community Benefit Plan and Report process and findings through presentations across Sharp, including to management, entity boards and committees, and others upon request Implements community benefit a ctivities identified for the upcoming FY Figure 1 2 outlines Sharp's community benefit process.

Costs for patients paid through the Medicare program on a prospective basis also include payments to thi rd parties related to the specific population. 30 Charity care and bad debt reflect the unreimbursed co sts of providing services to patients without the ability to pay for services at the time the services were rendered. 31 \"Vulnerable populations\" means any population that is exposed to medical or financial risk by virtue of being uninsured, underinsured, or elig ible for Medi -Cal, Medicare, Ca lifornia Children's Services Program, or county indigent programs. 32 Unreimbursed costs may include an hourly rate for labor and benefits p lus costs for supplies, materials and other purcha sed services. Any offsetting revenue (such as fees, grants or exte rnal donations) is deducted from the costs of providing services. Unreimbursed costs were estimated by each department responsible for providing the program or service. Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 88 Figure 13: Percentage of Community Benefit by SB 697 Category Sharp Chula Vista Medical Center \u2014 FY 2022 Key highlights: Medical Care Services included uncompensated care for patients wh o were unable to pay for services and unreimbursed costs of public programs, such as Medi -Cal, Medicare, CMS and CHAMPVA/TRICARE.33 In FY 2020, the State of California and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Se rvices approved a Medi -Cal Hospital Fee Progr am for the time period of July 1, 2019, through December 31, 2021 , and in FY 2022 the same agencies approved another Medi -Cal Hospital Fee Program for the time period of January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2022 . This resulted in recognition of net supplem ental revenues for SCVMC totaling $ 24.7 million in FY 2022. This reimbursement helped offset prior years' unreimbursed medical care services; however, the additional funds recorded in FY 202 2 understate the true unreimbursed medical care services performed for the past fiscal year. Other Benefits for Vulnerable Populations included van transportation for patients to and from medical appointments; Project Hospital Emergency Liaison Program (Project HELP), which provides funding for medication and transporta tion to assist lower -income patients; programming to help establish m edical homes for low - 33 The Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs (CHAMPV A) is a health benefits program in which the Department of Veterans Affairs shares the cost of certain health care services and supplies with eligible beneficiaries.

In ad dition, hospital staff actively participated in community boards, committees and other civic organizations, including the American Cancer Society (ACS), American Heart Association (AHA), American Hospital Association Regional Policy Board, Chula Vista Cham ber of Commerce, Health Sciences High and Middle College (HSHMC), Rotary Club of Chula Vista , San Diego Association of Directors of Volunteer Services (SDADVS) and South County Economic Development Council . See Appe ndix A for a list of Sharp's community involvement. The category also includes costs associated with community benefit planning and administration, including community health needs assessment (CHNA) development and participation. Health Research, Educat ion and Training Programs included education and training of health care professionals; student and intern supervision; and time devoted to generalizable health -related research projects that were made available to the broader health care community. Definition of Community SCVM C is located at 751 Medical Center Court in Chula Vista, ZIP code 91911 . The community served by SCVMC encompasses the south region of San Diego County (SDC), including the subregional areas of Chula Vista, Imperial Beach, Otay Me sa, Bonita, Sweetwater, N ational City and Coronado. See Appendix B for a map of community and regional boundaries in SDC. Notably, Coronado residents primarily use Sharp Coronado Hospital Center (SCHHC) . For SC VMC's 2022 CHNA process, the Dignity Health and IBM Watson Health Community Need Index (CNI) was used to identify communities within its service area that experience greater health inequities .34,35 The CNI uses demographic and economic statistics to provide a \"CNI score\" for every populated ZIP code in the U.S. CNI scores measure inequity on a scale ranging from very low health inequity to very high health 34 Dignity Health a nd IBM Watson Health Community Need Index ( CNI) (2022). The Dignit y Health and IBM Watson CNI was discontinued on January 31, 2023. 35 According to the World Health Organization ( WHO ), health inequities are differences in health status or in the distributio n of health resources between different population groups arising from the social conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work and age. These inequities have significant social and economic costs both to individuals and societies (WHO, 2018). Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 90 inequity. This measurement is an average determined through an analysis of specific socioeconomic barrie rs to health care access, including education, income, culture/language, insurance , and housing. As such, the CNI demonstrates the link between community need, access to care and preventable hospitalizat ions. According to the CNI, communities served by S CVMC with especially high need include Chula Vista, National City, Encanto, Paradise Hills, and Otay .34 Figure 14 presents a map of the CNI findings across San Diego's south region. Figure 14: CNI Map \u2014 SDC's South Region36 SCVMC has been providing health care to the south region for more than 40 years. In the past decade, population growth in this community has exceeded that of almost every other region in the nation. This trend is expected to continue \u2014 particularly for sen iors. To meet this increased need for care, SCVMC began construction on a new patient tower in 2016. The Ocean View Tower opened in January 2020 and provided an additional 106 beds, six state -of-the-art operating rooms, advanced health ca re technology and programs, and services to expedite and improve care for community members in the south region. 36 Truven Health Analytics, 2022; Insurance Coverage Estimates, 2022; The Nielson Company, 2022; and CNI, 2022. Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 91 Description of Community Health SDC's south region population is largely Hispanic ( 61.3%), and in 2022 , there were 77,883 residents ages 65 and older, represe nting 14.3% of the population. Between 2022 and 2027 , it is anticipated that the senior population in SDC's south region will grow by 15.8%.37 In 2020 , 11.3% of the south region population reported living below 100% of the federal poverty level (FPL), which was higher than the rate for SDC overall ( 10.8%). The unemployment rate in SDC's south region was 8.4%, which was higher than the rate for SDC overall ( 5.9%). In addition, 6.4% of households received Supplemental Security Income \u2014 a higher rat e than SDC overall ( 5.1%).38 According to the San Diego Hunger Coalition, while nutrition insecurity39 has declined since 2021, high rates remain due to long -standing economic disparities that were exacerbated by the COVID -19 pandemic . As of March 20 22, 2 8% of San Diegans experienced nutrition insecurity and 35% of children lived in nutrition -insecure households. In addition, in 2022, Latinos in SDC had a significantly higher incidence of food insecurity (39%) compared to residents of the county overa ll, illustrating the disproportionate impact of nutrition insecurity on diverse communities.40 In 2020 , 10.1% of households in the south region received Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, while 17.4% of the population lived at or below 138% FPL and were eligible for the program. These rates were higher than SDC overall (7.1% of households participated in SNAP benefits while 16.7% of households lived at or below 138% FPL).38 Please refer t o Table 16 for SNAP participation and eligibility in the south region.

Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 94 Priority Community Needs Addressed in Community Benefit Report \u2014 SCVMC 2022 CHNA SCVMC completed SCVMC's 2022 CHNA was significantly influenced by the collaborative Hospital Association of San Diego and Imperial Cou nties (HASD&IC) 2022 CHNA process and findings. Please refer to Section 3: Community Benefit Planning Process for a detailed description of Sharp's process and findings. In addition, this year SCVMC updated its implementation strategy \u2014 a description of SCVMC programs designed to address the priority health and s ocial needs identified in the 2022 CHNA. Through the SCVMC 2022 CHNA, the following priority health and social needs were identified for the communities served by SCVMC (listed in alphabetical order): Access to Health Care Aging Care & Support Behavior al Health Children & Youth Well -being Chronic Health Conditions Community Safety Economic Stability Maternal & Prenatal Health , including High -Risk Pregnancy The following pages detail SCVMC programs, activities and services that specifically address these needs, either directly or indirectly. Please refer to Section 1 (Overview): Patient Access to Care Programs for additional entity and systemwide programs designed to address access to health care. SCVMC addresses chr onic health conditions by provi ding education and healthy lifestyle programs as part of care for cardiovascular disease (CVD) , cancer, diabetes , obesity and other issues influenced by healthy weight and exercise. In addition, Sharp Rees -Stealy Medical Cent ers throughout SDC \u2014 including the south region \u2014 provide structured weight management and health education programs to community members, such as smoking cessation and stress management, long -term support for weight management and personalized weight -loss programs. For additional details on SCVMC programs that specifically address the needs identified in the 2022 CHNA, please refer to SCVMC's implementation strategy . The most recent CHNA and implementation strategy for SCVMC are available at http://www.sharp.com/about/community/health - needs -assessments.cfm . Further, SCVMC's behavioral health (including substance use) c ommunity efforts are supported through the programs and ser vices provided by Sharp Mesa Vista Hospital and Sharp McDonald Center, which are the major providers of behavioral health and substance use treatment services in SDC. Please refer to Section 11 of this report for Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 95 details on tho se programs. Lastly, community safety is addressed through Sharp's ThinkFirst San Diego (ThinkFirst), a program led by Sharp Rehabilitation Services. ThinkFirst provides education on injury prevention and the lifelong effects of brain, spinal cord and other traumatic injuries to community members throughout SDC. For each priority community need identified above, subsequent pages include a summary of the rationale for and importance of the need, objective(s), FY 202 2 Report of Activities conducted in supp ort of the objective(s), and FY 202 3 Plan. Identified Community Need: Education, Support and Screening for Stroke Rationale references the findings of t he SCVMC 2022 CHNA, HASD&IC 2022 CHNA or the most community health statistics unless otherw ise indicated . Rationale The HASD&IC and SCVMC 2022 CHNAs identified chronic conditions (including CVD and cerebrovascular diseases/stroke) as one of th e priority health and social needs affecting the community members served by SCVMC. Participants in c ommunity engagement activities conducted as part of the HASD&IC and SCVMC 2022 CHNAs identified numerous barriers to care for chronic conditions that have been exacerbated by the COVID -19 pandemic, including fear of contracting COVID -19; s ocial isolation; high prescription and insurance costs; insurance conflicts; eligibility requirements for appropriate programs; and hardships related to housing. Data analysis in Sharp's 2022 CHNAs revealed a higher volume of hospital discharges for CVD in communities fa cing greater socioeconomic challenges within SDC's south region , such as Chula Vista and National City.46 Participants in the interviews conducted by community health workers and promotor es as part of the HASD&IC 2022 CHNA identified hear t disease and stro ke as major health concern s among community members. Analysis of Sharp clinical data from FY 2016 to 2021 showed a 15% increase in stroke diagnoses among hospital inpatients, demonstrating the impact of patients delaying care due to the COVID -19 pandemic. In addition, the ratio of stroke deaths observed at Sharp hospitals in 2021 was 9% higher than expected when compared to 2016. Further, unpredictability during the COVID -19 pandemic has caused delays or disrupted access to routine and s pecialty care. Thi s makes receiving comprehensive care even more challenging for people living with chronic health conditions. HASD&IC 2022 CHNA community engagement participants also identified the following hospital discharge challenges and barriers for patients, includi ng those with chronic conditions ; low health literacy and medication adherence; lack of access to stable housing to facilitate healing and recovery; and long wait times to access the appropriate level of care. 46 Dignity Health and IBM Watson Health CNI (2022). Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 96 In 2020 , cerebrovascular di seases , including stroke , were the fourth leading cause of death for SDC's south region.44,45 There were 247 deaths due to stroke in SDC's south region in 20 19. The region' s age-adjusted death rate due to stroke was 47.3 per 100,000 population. This rate was the highest among all SDC regions and was significantly higher than the HP2030 target of 33.4 deaths per 100,000.44 In 2019, there w ere 1,182 hospitalizations due to stroke in SDC's south region. The region's age -adjusted rate of hospitalizations for stroke was 247.8 per 100,000 population \u2014 the highest among all SDC regions.47 In 2019, there were 429 stroke -related emergency departmen t (ED) visits in SDC's south region. The age -adjusted rate of ED visits was 88.3 per 100,000 population. According to 2021 CHIS data, 34.4% of residents in SDC's south region had ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure, while 7.2% had borderline high blood pressure. In addition, 25.1% of south region adults reported being obese \u2014 higher than SDC overall (21.7%).43 According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), more than 795,000 people i n the U.S. have a stroke each year, and strokes are responsible for approxi mately 1 out of every 6 deaths from CVD .48 The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke reports that 25% of people who recover from their first stroke will have anoth er stroke within five years .49 The CDC estimates that up to 80% of strokes are preventable through the recognition of early signs/symptoms and the elimination of stroke risk factors. Behaviors that can mitigate the risk of stroke include choosing a healthy diet full of fruits and vegetables, maintaining a healthy weight, engaging in at least 2.5 hours of moderate -intensity aerobic physical activity each week, refraining from or quitting smoking and limiting alcohol intake .50 Despite encouraging data about de clining stroke incidence, on a global level the aging population a nd accumulating risk factors contribute to an increasing lifetime risk of stroke .51 Objective Provide stroke education, support and screening services for the south region of SDC FY 202 2 Report of Activities In December 2021, the Joint Commission and AHA/ American Stroke Association (ASA) re-certified SCVMC as a Primary Stroke Center. The program is nationally recognized for its outreach, education and thorough screening procedures, as wel l as documentation of its success rate. In additio n, SCVMC is a recipient of the AHA/ASA's 47 County of San Diego HHSA, PHS, CHSU (2021); U.S. Census Bureau, 201 5-2019 American Community Survey 5 -year estimates. 48 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) (2022), Stroke Facts. 49 National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (2022), Stroke. 50 CDC (2022), Men and Stroke. 51 American Heart Association (2022), U.S. stroke rate declining in adults 75 and older , yet rising in adults 49 and younger .

The AHA/ASA's GWTG is a national effort focused on ensuring the use of evidence -based therapies to improve outcomes for stroke patients. The AHA/ASA's Target: Stroke Elite Honor Roll designation focuses on improving the timeliness of intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV t -PA) administrat ion to eligible patients. In FY 2022, Sharp's systemwide stroke program and SCVMC's Stroke Program had anticipated participating in a variety of screening and educational events, however many events were c anceled or postponed due to the ongoing impact of the COVID -19 pandemic. Despite these circumstances, efforts were made to bring virtual stroke education to the community. In partnership with Sharp 's marketing team, the systemwide stroke program shared inf ormation about stroke and atrial fibrillation through Sharp's social media channels and more . Building off its successful implementation in FY 2021, this virtual community education had an expansive reach, connecting with more than 17,000 individuals in FY 2022. In FY 2022, SCVMC shared information about CVD through various media outlets, including newsletters and social media. Articles discussed computed tomography (CT) perfusion imaging for stroke as well as cancer and CVD as the leading causes of death in the U.S. in 2022. SCVMC continued its 17 -year collaboration with the County of San Diego Emergency Medical Services (EMS) to provide data for the SDC stroke registry, where data is tracked to identify gaps and determine trends. SCVMC also continued to actively participate i n the quarterly San Diego County Stroke Consortium, a collaborative effort with other SDC hospitals to improve stroke care and discuss issues impacting stroke care in SDC. The San Diego County Stroke Consortium consists of 18 hospita ls \u2014 including SCVMC, SCHHC , , Sharp Memorial Hospital (SMH) , Alvarado Hospital Medical Center, Kaiser San Diego Medical Center, Kaiser Zion Medical Center, Palomar Medical Center, Paradise Valley Hospital, Scripps Memorial Hos pital Encinitas, Scripp s Memorial Hospital La Jolla, Scripps Mercy Hospital Chula Vista, Scripps Mercy Hospital San Diego, Temecula Valley Hospital, Tri - City Medical Center, University of California (UC) San Diego Medical Center, and UC San Diego Medical C enter - La Jolla \u2014 all of which are San Diego County Stroke Receiving Centers and certified by the Joint Commission. In response to the COVID -19 pandemic, meetings continued to be held virtually in FY 2022. Sharp's systemwide stroke program continued to partner with the San Di ego County Stroke Consortium to develop educational materials, including training videos, for AMR (American Medical Response) San Diego, a medical transportation company that assists with emergency and non -emergency transportation. In November, this includ ed a video addressing the topics of new stroke procedures and guidelines, and how to assess a stroke patient at the scene. Further, Sharp's systemwide stroke program continues to participate in the development of EMS protocol updates . Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 98 Sharp's systemwide stroke program also collaborated with San Diego County Stroke Consortium hospitals in FY 2022 to help alleviate community concerns related to obtaining health care during the COVID -19 pandemic. Using social media, the hospitals relea sed a message encouragi ng San Diegans not to delay seeking care during the pandemic. Each message sent from Sharp reached 16,000 subscribers on Facebook, Instagram and other Sharp -associated social media outlets. FY 202 3 Plan SCVMC Stroke Program will d o the following:52 Provide stroke education, screening and outreach to community members in the south region via social media and in person classes Participate in the San Diego County Stroke Consortium Participate in annual EMS education, with a focus on L arge Vessel Occlusion, or blockages of the proximal intracranial anterior and posterior circulation, identification in the field Collaborate with SCVMC's marketing team to extend community education on stroke information and events Provide data to the SDC stroke registry Provi de stroke risk factor education to community health professionals at the Veterans Home of California, Chula Vista Identified Community Need: Cancer Education and Patient Navigator Services Rationale references the findings of the SCV MC 2022 CHNA, HASD&IC 2022 CHNA or the most recent SDC community health statistics unless otherwise indicated. Rationale The HASD&IC and SCVMC 2022 CHNAs identified chronic health conditions, including cancer, as one of the priority health and social nee ds affecting the community members served by SCVMC. Focus groups conducted as part of the HASD&IC 2022 CHNA described the following challenges related to accessing cancer care: delayed or disrupted access to cancer screening during the COVID -19 pandemic; financial stressors, including the cost of health insurance premiums and co -pays; stigma surrounding a cancer diagnosis; and practical issues to facilitate healing and recovery, such as housing and transportation. In addition, undocumented community member s with cancer were described as being at a severe disadvantage, as many lack the necessary insurance coverage to enroll in programs and services that could provide financial, logistical and other supportive needs. 52 Where applicable, the Sharp Chula Vista Medical Center ( SCVMC ) Stroke Program will perform these activities as COVID -19 public health and safety guidelines allow. Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 99 Data analysis in the SCVMC 2022 CHNA revea led a higher volume of hospital discharges due to cancer in communities within SDC's south region facing greater socioeconomic challenges, such as National City and San Ysidro.46 Participants in the interviews conducted by community health workers and promotor es as part of the HASD&IC 2022 CHNA identified cancer as a majo r health concern among community members. Analysis of Sharp patient data from FY 2016 to 2021 showed a significant decline in cancer screening volumes during the pandemic. Further analysis is needed to assess the impact of the pandemic on screening and onc ology patient volumes. Participants in the Institute for Public Health's (IPH) Sharp Provider Survey conducted as part of the SCVMC 2022 CHNA process reported that patients are more fearful \u2014 in general and of coming in for annual cancer screenings. In addition, due to the pandemic, respondents identified populations appropriate for cancer screenings as having increased fear related to usi ng hea lth care services. Sharp cancer patient navigators and clinical social workers who participated in focus groups noted that cancer patients may have limited access to specialty care because health care professionals are overwhelmed. Sharp work s with cance r specialists across the system to improve access within and among various practices. The most frequently observed cancers at SCVMC in 2021 were (in rank order): breast ( 20.7% all cancer cases), lung prostate 6.0%). In total, there were 969 new cases of cancer at SCVMC in 2021 . According to 2021 Sharp oncology data, 73.7% of the 372 SCVMC cancer patients who received the cancer psychosocial distress scr eening were identified as at -risk for anxiety or depression, and were referred to internal or external resources, such as social workers or community cancer resources. Sharp 2021 onco logy data identified the top 10 areas of concern for Sharp cancer patien ts: health insurance or money worries; worrying about the future and what lies ahead ; pain; exercising and being physically active ; feeling too tired; worrying about family, children o r friends; changes/disruptions in work; sleep; making a treatment decisi on; and feeling nervous. In 2020 , cancer was the leading cause of death in SDC's south region as well as SDC overall .44,45 There were 777 deaths due to cancer (al l types) in SDC's south region in 2019. The region's age -adjusted rate of death due to cancer was 162.6 deaths per 100,000 population, which is higher than the overall SDC age -adjusted rate of 135.2 per 100,000 population . In 2019, the south region's age -adjusted death rates were higher than the ra tes for SDC overall for the following cancers: bladder, brain, colorectal, female breast and reproductive, kidney, leukemia, liver, lung, non -Hodgkin's lymphoma, pancreatic and prostate. In 2019, 15.4% of all ca ncer deaths in SDC's south region were due t o lung cancer, 10.2% to colorectal cancer, 9.1% to liver cancer, 7.7% to pancreatic cancer and 6.4% to female breast cancer and prostate cancer. 53 Cancers of the hematopoietic and reticuloendo thelia l system include various malignancies that impact the blood and im mune system, such as Hodgkin's and non -Hodgkin's lymphoma, leukemia and myeloma (Sharp Cancer Registry, 2021 ). Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 100 The ACS estimates that in 2022, there will be 189,220 new cancer c ases diagnosed and 60,970 cancer deaths in t he state of California.54 According to findings from the ACS Cancer Facts & Figures 2022 report , older age and being female are the strongest risk factors for breast cancer. Potentially modifiable factors associat ed with increased risk include weight gain after the age of 18 and/or being overweight or obese, menopausal hormone therapy, alcohol consumption and physical inactivity.55 The same report indicates that people with lower socioeconomic status have higher cancer death rates than those with higher soc ioeconomic status, regardless of demographic factors such as race/ethnicity. Racial and ethnic disparities in the cancer burden largely reflect disproportionate poverty. Social inequalities, including communication barriers and provider/patient assumptions , can affect interactions between patients and physicians and contribute to miscommunication and/or delivery of substandard care.55 A recent study by the ACS found that at least 42% of newly diagnosed cancer cases in the U.S. \u2014 about 805, 600 cases in 2022 \u2014 are potentially avoidable. This includes the 19% of all cancers caused by tobacco use as well as the 18% caused by a combination of excess body weight, alcohol consum ption, poor nutrition and physical inactivity.55 Studies have shown that patient navigators contribute to better access and continuity of care, which offers a promising approach to better care integration. In cancer care, navigators help patients to move through the entire care continuum, from prevention to survivorship. Navigators typically identify individual needs and barriers to care, educating patients and communities, and linking patients with different ca re providers.56 According to the National Institutes of Health, clinical trials, a part of clinical research, are at the heart of all medical advances. Clinical trials explore new ways to prevent, detect or treat disease, and offer hope for many people as w ell as an opportunity to help researchers find better treatments for others in the future.57 Objectives Provide cancer education, resources and support groups to community members in SDC's south region Provide cancer support services, including health car e navigation, to community members in SDC's south region FY 202 2 Report of Activities The Cancer Center s of Sharp HealthCare (Cancer Centers of Sharp) include the Douglas & Nancy Barnhart Cancer Center at SCVMC (Barnhart Cancer Center), David and Donna L ong Center for Cancer Treatment at SGH, and Laurel Amtower Cancer 54 American Cancer Society ( ACS) Cancer Statistics Center (2022), California at a Glance . 55 ACS (2022), Cancer Facts & Figures 2022 . 56 European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies (in partnership with the WHO ) (2022).

Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 101 Institute and Neuro -Oncology Center at SMH. The Cancer Centers of Sharp are accredited by the American College of Surgeons Commission on Cancer (CoC) as an Integrated Network Cancer Program (INCP), demonstrating Sharp's commitment to meeting rigorous standards and improving the quality of care for patients with cancer. In FY 2021, the Cancer Centers of Sharp received APEx (Accreditation Program for Excellence) accreditation by the American So ciety for Radiation Oncology, in recognition of Sharp's dedication to promoting effective communication a nd coordinated radiation oncology treatment, as well as engaging patients and their families as partners in care. The Cancer Centers of Sharp, includ ing the Barnhart Cancer Center, serve community members, patients and their loved ones through a variety of free cancer support groups, education classes and workshops and community events, as well as patient navigation and other support services. In FY 20 22, all programs were provided online in response to the ongoing COVID -19 pandemic and served more than 1 ,700 community members impacted by cancer. The Cancer Centers of Sharp, including the Barnhart Cancer Center, continued to offer virtual educational classes at no cost for patients and community members facing cancer. Through the monthly Lunch and Learn Cancer Education series, community members, patients and families were invited to hear local experts speak about a unique cancer -related topic each mon th, such as cancer and sexuality ; communicat ing with one's health care team ; communicati ng with loved ones ; how to prepare for the worst while hoping for the best ; humor and cancer ; care for the caregivers ; self-care; stress management ; the science of maki ng healthy lifestyle changes ; self-talk; talking to children about cancer ; and cancer and aging. Over 15 classes were offered through virtual platforms , reaching more than 390 individuals. Additionally, the programs were recorded and shared with another 75 individuals who were not able to attend the live webinar. Other educational classes offer ed by the Cancer Centers of Sharp included nutrition management and healthy eating before, during and after treatment; nutrition and healthy eating during and after b reast cancer treatment; cancer and lymphedema \u2014 a condition where swelling occurs because of damage or blockage in the lymphatic system; and structured healing art activities to improve overall well -being. Since the classes were offered virtual ly, allowing individuals to participate in the comfort of their own homes, attendance increased compar ed to pre -pandemic levels . The Cancer Centers of Sharp, including the Barnhart Cancer Center, offered free virtual workshops for patients and community members. This included advance care planning (ACP ) workshops provided in collaboration with Sharp's ACP department . Led by Sharp HospiceCare team members with specialized training in ACP, t he webinars helped participants identify their personal health care choices, co mmunicat e their wishes to loved ones, and develop their advance health care directive . The Cancer Centers of Sharp also offered four rotating monthly workshops for cancer patients and their loved ones, titled Relaxation and Quieting the Mind ; Chemo Brain W orkshop: Improving Memory and Concentr ation ; Scanxiety: Managing the Fear of Cancer Recurrence ; and Managing Sleep and Fatigue. A virtual Relaxation Skills workshop was provided each week, during which a clinician offered breathing and other relaxation exe rcises as well Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 102 as guided meditations t o reduce tension and stress. An additional workshop related to \"chemo brain \" was added over the summer titled How to Help Someone with Chemo Brain - A Class for Loved Ones. Attended by 75 individuals , this program was offered as a result of hearing from patients that their loved ones should have more information on how to support them during their experience with cancer -related cognitive impairment. In total, more than 420 community members attended these classes and workshops in FY 2022. Further, SCVMC offered a free Advanced Treatment Options for Prostate Cancer Webinar for more than 10 attendees in July. In October, the Cancer Centers of Sharp offered a webinar titled Surviving Cancer: Thriving After a Diagnosis to m ore than 50 individuals. At t he webinar, a Sharp -affiliated physician discussed her personal journey with breast cancer, and Sharp oncology social workers and a dietitian presented on thriving after a cancer diagnosis, nutrition and exercise for survivors , and cancer -related cognitive impairment. In FY 2022, the Cancer Centers of Sharp continued to provide an assortment of online support groups, which were also promoted by the Barnhart Cancer Center. Support group offerings included general cancer, living with advanced cancer, men wi th any cancer diagnosis at any stage, head and neck cancers, art and chat, young patients living with cancer, brain tumor, brain tumor care partner s, and breast cancer. In FY 2022, the Cancer Centers of Sharp offered two new su pport groups, including a can cer support group for community members living with any type of cancer as well as a cancer survivors support group, during which the group discussed day -to-day challenges of cancer survivorship \u2014 fear o f recurrence and long -term life -altering side - effects. In addition, the Barnhart Cancer Center offered a support group in Spanish for patients diagnosed with cancer. More than 620 community members attended cancer support groups in FY 2022. In February, the Barnhart Cancer Cente r partnered with and particip ated in the South Bay Family YMCA's Community Connections program. Through the program, the YMCA invites community partners to join them in providing resources and activities that promote a healthy spirit, mind and body. The Ba rnhart Cancer Center provided education on monthly breast self -examinations and various cancer resources, as well as answered questions. Approximately 50 community members attended the event. In FY 2022, the Cancer Centers of Sharp launched a private Fac ebook group titled Sharp HealthCare Cancer Patient Community. This group was created for cancer patient s and their loved ones to create a sense of community and connection as well as provide rel iable information, thoughtful content, live discussions, and a quick and easy way to view current program and service offerings. This Facebook page has more than 150 participants who are able to access up -to-date and vetted information, as well as post abo ut issues of concern related to themselves and others. Begin ning in July 2021, a taskforce was formed to explore the development of a continuum of care for patients experiencing chemo brain, more formally known as cancer -related cognitive impairment. Bui lding off the existing webinar for chemo brain, Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 103 the group crea ted a supportive process for patient care, from diagnosis onward , developing educational materials, an additional webinar for loved ones, one -on-one assessment and treatment by a Sharp speech la nguage pathologist, an eight -session class taught by the speec h language pathologist and an oncology social worker, and a mentor ship program for graduates. Throughout FY 2022, two cohorts of the eight - session class have been completed. These two cohorts featured a total of 14 participants, who provided positive feedb ack on the experience and degree of support they received. This contin uum of care is the first of its kind in San Diego. From June to November 2021, Sharp's systemwide INCP participated on the ) clinical study titled Retu rn to Cancer Screening. As a systemwide effort, Sharp participated in this clinical study to increase the pre -pandemic screening rates for both breast and colorectal cancers by 10% and reduce the backlog in screenings caused by pandemic disruptions. Variou s departments implemented measures to bring patients in for screenings , which included social media campaigns, news stories, and personal outreach for booking appointments, mailings and reminders. Findings were reported in February 2022: Sharp's breast can cer screening goal reached 91% of the target and colorectal cancer scr eenings exceeded the goal, with 103% of target . Beginning in January, Sharp participated in a second PDSA clinical study with the CoC addressing smoking cessation as a means to improve patient cancer risk and treatment outcomes. This study reviewed whethe r all newly diagnosed cancer patients are being asked about their smoking status and offered cessation resources as appropriate . The initial data collection suggested that Sharp provider s are consistently asking this question during consultation appointments (99% of the time) but smoking cessation resources offered to patients varied and were inconsistent across the system . Sharp improved its process by creating a new, Sharp -branded patie nt resource to be shared with all cancer treatm ent providers. Final smoking cessation data will be collected and reported in February 2023. The Cancer Centers of Sharp, including the Barnhart Cancer Center, participated in the Sharp Women's Health Confere nce in May. Held at the Sheraton San Diego Hote l & Marina, the conference encouraged attendees to live a healthier, more balanced life. Approximately 650 community members were inspired by the conference's speakers, multiple breakout sessions and exhibitor s, who offered screenings, assessments, health resources, pampering services and more. During the event, the Cancer Centers of Sharp offered education on how to properly perform a breast self -exam and the importance of performing monthly exam s; information on cancer support services, including nurse na vigation, social work, nutrition, education and available classes; and informational materials on cancer. The Barnhart Cancer Center also continued to offer a wig and prosthesis bank. In FY 2022, the cancer center provided cancer patients with donated wi gs, prosthetic devices and bras. The Barnhart Cancer Center also partnered with Renewing Life and ACS to coordinate transportation at no cost for patients receiving treatment. In addition, ACS Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 104 provided patient s with essential lodging services, as needed. The Barnhart Cancer Center offers a cancer patient navigator program that provides personalized education, support and guidance to patients and their loved ones from early detection through diagnosis and trea tment. In FY 2022, the navigation team assisted more than 330 patients in -person, virtually and over the telephone. The team includes nurses, a medical social worker, a genetics counselor, a speech -language pathologist, a lymphedema therapist and a palliat ive care specialist. In addition, the team incl udes a certified dietitian who identifies patients at risk of nutritional problems and provides classes and referrals to meal delivery services and in -home parenteral nutrition care \u2014 an intravenous method of delivering nutrients. In FY 2022, four volunteers assisted patients with scheduling telemedicine appointments and troubleshooting technical issues. Additional volunteers brought warm blankets to patients in the waiting room and provided other assistance a s needed. Further, each week, a volunteer provided Healing Touch energy therapy to patients in the Outpatient Infusion Center. In FY 2022, SCVMC helped raise community awareness of cancer through a variety of methods. In honor of National Mammography Day in October, SCVMC -affiliated physicians and staff joined the annual Sharp Goes Pink effort, wearing pink to raise awareness of the lifesaving importance of mammograms. Throughout FY 2022, Sharp cancer specialists appeared in local English - and Spanish -language media as well as sharp.com articles to educate community members about cancer. Topics included eating right during cancer treatment; the benefits of 3D mammography and seeing cancer clearly; the difference in symptoms between lung cancer and COVID -19; the link between back pain and cancer; and ovarian cancer symptoms. For more than 20 years, the Clinical Oncology Research (COR) Department at Sharp has conducted clinical trials to facilitate the discovery of new and improved treatments for cancer patie nts and to enhance scie ntific knowledge for the larger health and research communities. Sharp's COR program includes a balanced portfolio of industry - sponsored, investigator -initiated and National Cancer Institute (NCI) studies. These studies explore the e fficacy and safety of n ovel cancer therapeutic agents or technologies to benefit the most common cancer types. NCI studies focus on optimizing the standard of care. Sharp's COR collaborates with 22 physician -investigators throughout SDC's south, east and c entral regions. This br ings innovative treatments close to research participants' homes and minimizes the travel time for their care and study participation. In FY 2022, the COR pre -screened 400 patients for participation in oncology clinical trials. As a result, 33 patients co nsented to participate in cancer research studies. Clinical trials focused on multiple types of cancer, including but not limited to brain, breast, colon, head and neck, lung, lymphoma, pancreatic and prostate. Sharp is the only heal th care organization in SDC to be accredited by the Association for the Accreditation of Human Research Protection Programs, demonstrating Sharp's commitment to rigorous standards for ethics, quality and protection for research participants. Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 105 FY 202 3 Plan The Barnhart Cancer Cen ter at SCVMC will do the following:58 Partner with local organizations and agencies to provide underserved community members with health education and access to cancer screenings Offer cancer support groups for patients, caregivers a nd loved ones as well as members of the community, including groups in English and Spanish Offer wigs, prosthetics, bras, hats and scarves to patients with cancer Offer monthly educational classes on nutrition for cancer prevention and nutrition during can cer treatment in both English and Spanish Offer classes to ad dress cognitive impairments related to cancer and cancer treatments Collaborate with the Cancer Centers of Sharp to provide virtual workshops on various cancer wellness topics, including Spanish -language options Provide meeting space for quarterly session s of the Look Good Feel Better program Offer monthly ACP and lymphedema education classes Provide patients with campus wayfinding and golf cart transportation to other appointments and the pharm acy for medication pick -up Provide the private Sharp HealthCa re Cancer Patient Community Facebook group Offer two new support groups \u2014 one for cancer survivors and one for Spanish - speaking patients Participate in and provide fundraising for events to sup port cancer research in SDC Participate in and offer various cancer resources at the Aging Conference at the Elks Lodge in October Implement a patient and family advisory counsel Identified Communi ty Need: Diabetes Education, Prevention and Support Rationale references the findings of the SCVMC 2022 CHNA, HASD&IC 2022 CHNA or the most recent SDC community health statistics unless otherwise indicated. Rationale The HASD&IC and SCVMC 2022 CHNAs identified chronic conditions, including diabetes, as one of the priority health concerns affecting community members served b y SCVMC. Data analysis in the SCVMC 2022 CHNA revealed a higher number of hospital discharges due to Type 2 diabetes in communities within SDC's south region \u2014 such as National City and San Ysidro \u2014 which face greater socioeconomic challenges.46 58 Where applicable, SCVMC will perform these activities as COVID -19 public health and s afety guidelines allow. Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 106 Participants in the interviews conducted by community health workers and promotor es as part of the HASD&IC 20 22 CHNA identified diabetes as a major healt h concern among community members. HASD&IC community engagement participants identified l ack of access to utilities and household appliances as a challenge to diabetes management due to the importance of proper medication storage and preparation of nutriti ous meals. Analysis of Sharp clinical data from FY 2016 to 2021 showed a 35% increase in diabetes diagnoses among hospital inpatients, demonstrating the impact of patients delaying care due to the COVID -19 pandemic . In addition, the ratio of diabetes death s observed at Sharp hospitals in 2021 was 89% higher than expected when compared to 2016. Furthermore, more than half (58.3%) of SCVMC inpatients with a diabetes diagnosis in 2020 were seniors. In addition, according to Sharp hospital data , 40% of COVID -19 inpatients admitted from March 2020 to March 2022 presented with diabetes ; individuals with diabetes were 2.1 times more likely to be admitted to the hospital than non -diabetic COVID - 19 patients. COVID -19 patients with diabetes were also 82% more likely t o require a stay in the intensive care unit (ICU). In 2020 , diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in SDC's south region.44,45 In 2019, there were 143 dea ths due to diabetes in SDC's south region. The region's age-adjusted death rate due to diabetes was 30.1 per 100,000 population, significantly higher than the overall SDC age -adjusted diabetes death rate (20.6 deaths per 100,000 population). In 2019, ther e were 1,082 hospitalizations due to diabetes in SDC's south region. The age -adjusted rate of hospitalization was 219.4 per 100,000 population. This rate was the highest among all SDC regions and was higher than the age -adjusted rate of hospitalization for SDC overall (137.2 per 100,000 population).47 In 2019, there were 1,223 diabetes -related ED visits in SDC's south region. The age-adjusted rate of diabetes -related ED visits was 252.4 per 100,000 population. This was the second highest rate among all SDC regions and was higher than the rate for SDC overall (169.1 per 100,000 population). According to 2021 CHIS data, 10.3% of adults living in SDC's south region indicated that they had ever been diagnosed with di abetes, which was higher than SDC overall ( 8.5%) but lower than the state of California (10.8%) . Diabetes rates among seniors were particularly high, with 25% of south region adults ages 65 and older reporting that they had ever been diagnosed with diabete s, which was higher than SDC overall (16.3%) .43 According to 2021 CHIS data, 22.1% of residents in the south region had been told by their doctor that they had pre - or borderline diabetes, slightly higher than residents of SDC overall ( 16.6%).43 According to a report from the American Diabetes Association (ADA) titled The Burden of Diabetes in California, approximately 10.5% of adults in California are diagnosed with diabetes. In addition, 33.4% of adults have prediabetes.59 Data presented by the CDC indicates that, in 2021, diabetes prevalence in California was highest among non -Hispanic Black individuals (17.5%), followed by Hispanic 59 American Diabetes Association (2021), The Burden of Diabetes in California. Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 107 individuals (13.3.%), non -Hispani c Asian individuals (11.5%) and non -Hispanic White individu als (9.2%).60 According to the CDC, diabetes is the seventh leading cause of death in the U.S. In addition, the number of adults diagnosed with diabetes in the U.S. has more than doubled in the last 20 years as the U.S. population has aged and become more overweight .61 The CDC's 2022 National Diabetes Statistics Report indicates that 89.8% of adults diagnosed with diabetes from 2015 to 2018 were overweight or obese, and 69% had high blood pressure. Factors that may reduce the risk of diabetes complications include having a usual source for diabetes care; meeting recommended physical activity goals; managing or losing weight; managing A1C (blood glucose) levels, blood pressure and cholesterol; and quitt ing smoking .62 The CDC estimates that 37.3 million people in the U.S. had diabetes in 2019. Of those individuals, 23% met laboratory criteria for diabetes but were not aware they had the disease.62 According to the CDC, diabetes increases the risk of heart disease and stroke and can lead to other serious complications, such as kidney failure, blindness and amputation of a toe, foot, or leg. People with diabetes spend more on health care, have fewer productive ye ars and miss more workdays compared to people who do not have diabetes.63 Objectives Provide diabetes education, prevention and support in the south region of SDC Collaborate with community organizations and projects to provide diabetes education to commu nity members with barriers to health equity Participate in local and national conferences to share best practices in diabetes treatment and control with the broader health care community FY 202 2 Report of Activities The SCVMC Diabetes Education Program is recognized by the ADA for meeting national standards for excellence and quality in diabetes education , including blood sugar monitoring, medication and nutrition al counseling as well as insulin pump and other device training. The program is led by certi fied diabetes care and education specialists, who provide individuals and their support systems with the skills needed to successfully manage various conditions, in cluding prediabetes, gestational diabetes (diabetes developed during pregnancy), as well as Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. In FY 2022, small group and one -on-one education options were offered in -person or online, in both English and Spanish. In FY 20 22, the Sharp Diabetes Education Program offered diabetes education and support to approximately 650 attendees at the Sharp Women's Health Conference. This 60 CDC (2022), Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, 2021. 61 CDC (2022), Diabetes Fast Facts. 62 CDC ( 2022), National Diabetes Statistics Report . 63 CDC National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (2022), Diabetes and Prediab etes. Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 108 included diabetes risk assessments using the ADA's Diabetes Risk Test questionnaire as well as resources on topics including the different types of diabetes; diabetes prevention; signs, symptoms and complications of diabetes; the connection between diabetes and CVD; nutrition and reading food labels; exercise; medication; and diabetes self-management. A Sharp d iabetes expert also provided education on the prevention and management of Type 2 diabetes, including helpful diets, physical activity and the power of lifestyle change . At the San Diego Crew Classic rowing event in March, a Sharp Diabetes Education Progra m nurse provided first aid in the Sharp medical tent and answered health -related questions f or approximately 200 attendees . In addition, t he Sharp Diabetes Education Program provided fundraising and team participation for the 2022 San Diego Heart & Stroke Walk in September. Although the program had anticipated participating in additional communit y events, conferences and educational presentations throughout FY 202 2, many in-person activities were canceled or postponed due to the COVID -19 pandemic. The Shar p Diabetes Education Program is an affiliate of the California Diabetes and Pregnancy Progra m's Sweet Success Program, which provides comprehensive technical support and education to medical personnel and community liaisons to promote improved outcomes for high-risk pregnant women with diabetes. As an affiliate, the Sharp Diabetes Education Progr am teaches underserved pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers with Type 1, Type 2 or gestational diabetes how to manage their blood sugar levels. In FY 2022 , the program collaborated with community clinics , including Family Health Centers of San Diego (FHCSD ), La Maestra, San Ysidro Health, Neighborhood Healthcare, Borrego Health, and San Diego Family Care to provide patients with education and resources to support a healthy pregnancy. Since the onset of the pandemic, the program has accommodated individu al preferences by serving patients with virtual, telephone and on -site options. Topics included gestational diabetes statistics ; new diagnostic criteria ; treatment and management of blood glucose levels ; goals for blood sugar levels before and after a meal ; insulin requirements ; self- care practices ; nutrition and meal planning ; exercise and weight management ; monitoring fetal movement ; and the risks and complications of uncontrolled diabetes. Clinic patients also received logbooks to track and manage their blood sugar levels. In addition, the Sharp Diabetes Education Program evaluated patients' management of their blood sugar levels and collaborated with community clinics' obstetrician/gynecologists (OB-GYN) to prevent complications. At SCVMC, the Sharp Diab etes Education Program provided services and education to more than 915 underserved pregnant and breastfeeding women with diabetes in FY 202 2. Throughout the year, the Sharp Diabetes Education Program continued to provide services and resources to meet th e nee ds of culturally diverse populations within SDC. Educational resources included: How to Live Healthy With Diabetes; What You Need to Know About Diabetes; All About Blood Glucose for People With Type 2 Diabetes; All About Carbohydrate Counting; Getting the Very Best Care for Your Diabetes; All About Insulin Resistance; All About Physical Activity With Diabetes; Gestational Diabetes Mellitus Seven -Day Menu Plan; and Food Groups. Resources were provided in Arabic, Somali, Tagalog, Vietnamese and Spanish, and f ood diaries and logbooks were Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 109 distributed to help community members track their blood sugar levels. Additionally, live interpreter services were available in more than 200 languages via the Stratus Video Interpreting iPad application. Further, Sharp's certified diabetes care and education specialists received training from the Sharp Equality Alliance to improve the delivery of inclusive and culturally competent care for diverse communities. In November, the Sharp Diabetes Education Program hosted a d iabet es conference for physicians, nurses, pharmacists, laboratorians, clinical and managerial leaders and other community health professionals interested in optimizing inpatient diabetes care. The conference provided approximately 150 participants with sp ecific tools and strategies for creating a hospital culture that supports and encourages emerging therapeutic trends in glycemic management. Topics included COVID -19 and how it highlights diabetes concerns ; the use of certain medicatio ns and continuous glu cose monitoring in the inpatient setting; the effect of nutrition on glycemic management ; the importance of g lycemic targets ; and d iabetes from a behavioral perspective . In FY 202 2, the Sharp Diabetes Education Program continued to se rve as an insulin pump training center to support endocrinologists and primary care physician (PCP) groups throughout SDC. Through this effort, the program trains community providers to use diabetes technology, including insulin pumps and blood glucose mon itors, to improve pat ient care and outcomes. Further, the Sharp Diabetes Education Program recently implemented an enhanced electronic medical record system to improve care coordination with more than 300 community endocrinologists and PCP groups. FY 202 3 Plan The SCVMC and the Sharp Diabetes Education Programs will do the following:64 Provide prediabetes and diabetes information to community members at various community venues in SDC's south region, as well as through virtual platforms Offer a webinar series on the role of n utrition in preparation for pregnancy, including information about diabetes Explore collaborations to assist and educate community members experiencing food insecurity Explore opportunities to provide diabetes education to th e Imperial Beach community Explore additional opportunities to provide community -based diabetes education classes Explore future collaborations with community clinics to provide education and resources to patients with diabetes Provide gestational diabetes services and resources to unde rserved pregnant and breastfeeding women, both at SCVMC and community clinics Offer blood glucose screenings for community members in the south region of SDC, as opportunities arise 64 Where applicable, the SCVMC and Sharp Diabetes Education P rogram will perform these activities as COVID -19 public health and safety guidelines allow. Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 110 Participate in Tour de Cure \u2014 the ADA's si gnature fundraising event to fi ght diabetes \u2014 as well as the San Diego Heart & Stroke Walk Maintain up -to-date resources about diabetes treatment and prevention to support community members with diabetes, particularly foreign language and culturally approp riate resources for diverse pop ulations Participate in local and national conferences to share best practices in diabetes treatment and control with the broader health care community Conduct educational symposiums for health care professionals focused on improving outpatient and inpati ent diabetes care Host a diabetes conference for health care professionals Explore collaborations with community organizations that focus on diabetes prevention and care Partner with community physicians to help them improve patient outcomes using techno logy, including insulin pumps and blood glucose monitors Participate in 2 -1-1 San Diego's (2 -1-1) Community Information Exchange (CIE) program to serve patients with barri ers to health equity by connecting them to community services Identified Community Need: Health Education and Screening Activities Rationale references the findings of the SCVMC 2022 CHNA, HASD&IC 2022 CHNA or the most recent SDC community health statist ics unless otherwise indicated. Rationale The HASD&IC and SCVMC 2022 CHNAs identif ied access to health care, aging care & support, behavioral health, children & youth well -being, chronic health conditions, community safety, and economic stability as the priority health and social needs affecting the community members serve d by SCVMC. In addition, maternal and prenatal care, including high -risk pregnancy, were identified in the SCVMC 2022 CHNA as priority health needs. HASD&IC's community engagement efforts described health literacy as a barrier in accessing health care. To help people u nderstand basic health information, there is a need for more education on preventive health care, healthy lifestyles and understanding the differences between sources of care (e.g., when to use urgent care v ersus the emergency room). Participants noted tha t health care settings should use simple, plain language forms to help people understand health information. Also, according to the HASD&IC 2022 CHNA, the pandemic further exacerbated existing health literacy challenges, such as peop le not understanding t heir health insurance benefits, not knowing whom to call to access services and difficulty identifying where to get care. Participants in the IPH Sharp Provider Survey conducted as part of the SCMVC 2022 CHNA process identified preg nant women as one of t he population s of patients impacted by COVID -19 in relation to increased anxiety and depression, and decreased access to behavioral health care. Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 111 The majority (96%) of Sharp Insight Community Survey respondents did not participate in Sharp's programs to co nnect individuals to support services or resources, which suggests that more can be done to promote community awareness about these services. Among those who did participate, programs accessed included diabetes care and education prog rams (12%); nutrition programs (6%); and weight management programs (6%). According to 2021 CHIS data, the self -reported obesity rate for adults in SDC's south region was 25.1%, higher than the rate for SDC overall ( 21.7%).43 In California, the self -reported obesity rate was 30.3% in 2020. Prevalence of obesity decreased as education levels increased, highlighting the need for health education as a tool for reducing obesity rates .65 A study published in the CDC's Morbidity and Morta lity Weekly suggests that risks of COVID -19-related hospitalization, ICU admission, invasive mechanical ventilation and death are higher with increasing body mass index , particularly among adults under the age of 65.66 According to the CDC, the leading caus es of preventable death include obesity - related conditions, such as heart disease, stroke, Type 2 diabetes and certain types of cancer .67 In 2021, 25.7% of south region residents living below 200% of the FPL reported enrollment in the CalFresh program .43 In 2019, seniors in SDC's south region experienced higher rates of hospitalization and ED visits for unintentional injuries, falls, cancer, coronary heart disease, stroke, diabetes, overall h ypertensive diseases, influenza, pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease /chronic lower respiratory diseases, asthma and Parkinson's disease when compared to SDC overall.47 In 2020 , there were 478 low birth weight (LBW) births in SDC's south region, accounting for 7.2% of the region's total births. In the same year, there were 77 very low birth weight (VLBW) births in the south region, or 1.2% of total births. In SDC overall in 2020 , LBW births accounted for 6.7% of births , while VLBW births accounted for 1.1% of all births.68 In 2020 , 5,789 live births received early prenatal care in the south region, which translates to 88.2% of all live births in the region.68 According to Live Well San Diego's San Diego County Report Card on Children and Families, 2021 , breastfeeding enhances immunity to disease, decreases the rate and severity of infections in ch ildren, is associated with healthy development and decreased risk of childhood obe sity and reduces lifelong risks for chronic health problems. Mothers who breastfeed may have a reduced risk of some cancers, quicker postpartum recovery time and less work mi ssed due to child illness .69 According to the CDC , more than 53 million people in the U.S. either already have osteoporosis or are at high risk due to low bone mass.70 Along with the financial 65 CDC (2022), Adult Obesity Prevalence Maps. 66 Kompaniyets L, Goodman AB, Belay B, et al.

With an average of 2 1 SCVMC team memb er donors per drive, SCVMC collected approximately 125 units of blood in FY 2022 , which helped save more than 370 lives. SCVMC staff also served on the medical crew and provided first aid care for participants of the 2021 Susan G. Komen San Diego 3 -Day bre ast cancer walk, which began in Del Mar and ended in Downtown, in November. In addition, SCVMC provided live webinars on joint pain topics, including treating knee, hip and shoulder pain ; atrial fibrillation; pelvic health issues; heart valve disease; and preparing for pregnancy to more than 160 community members in FY 2022 . Throughout FY 202 2, SCVMC's Wome Infants' Health Services led free , virtual breastfeeding support groups twice week ly in English and Spanish. Through these groups, t he hospital's certified lactation educators provided breastfeeding education, support and guidance to new mothers. In October, SCVMC's Women's & Infants' Health Services hosted its 2 1st Annual Breastfeeding Support Group Halloween Baby Parade for mothers and family members from the hospital's breastfeeding support groups. Mothers had the opportunity to dress their infants and children in costumes and celebrate with a drive -thru event, wher e approximately 50 cars drove by. The tiny trick - or-treaters, who traditionally parade around hospital floors, showed off their costumes from their cars and were handed Halloween gift bag s by staff. In addition, in February , May and August , Sharp -affiliate d physicians led t hree Planning for Pregnancy webinars for community members. The webinars discussed diet, prenatal vitamins, reproductive planning, fertility challenges, finding the righ t doctor and more. For a nominal fee, t he hospital also offered webin ars in both English and Spanish , titled Baby Care Basics, Childbirth Preparation and Breastfeeding. In May, SCVMC staff participated in the Sharp Women's Health Conference held at the Sheraton San Diego Hotel & Marina . During the event, various hospital d epartments engaged attendees with a variety of health information and resources, including blood 71 NIH (2019), Osteoporosis Overview. Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 113 transfusions and alternatives, cancer, diabetes prevention and care, stroke symptoms and r isk modification strategies, women's health from pre -conception to po st- menopausal, as well as bone density and stroke screenings and diabetes risk assessments. There were more than 20 breakout sessions with clinical experts discussing a range of health an d lifestyle topics , including cancer, women's health, cardiovascular health, orthopedics , pain relief, eating and living well, exercise and more. Breakout session speakers included SCVMC registered dietitians discussing the research on cancer and simple li festyle changes like a healthy diet to help reduce the risk of cancer or cancer recurrence, as well as the latest evidence -based research on common causes of and strategies to reduce inflammation, including eating strategies to improve overall health. In FY 202 2, SCVMC helped raise community awareness about important heal th issues through informational segments with local and national news media. Experts included SCVMC -affiliated physicians, nurses and ancillary health professionals representing emergency medicine, emergency services, physical therapy, rehabilitation, diab etes, OB-GYN , gastroenterology, cardiology and marketing . Topics included the reality of a mild COVID -19 breakthrough case ; the dangers of drowsy driving ; three ways to relieve holiday bu rnout ; six things to know about California's indoor mask mandate ; the safe way to get in shape ; what to do if a loved one has a heart attack ; diabetes care in the South Bay ; the COVID -19 vaccine and a woman's menstrual cycle ; decoding digestive and abdomin al pai n and the importance of timely care ; pelvic health conditions and treatments ; and exclusively pumping as a way to breastfeed. Throughout the year, SCVMC employees were active, contributing members of various community nonprofit organizations, inclu ding R otary Club of Chula Vista, HSHMC, Chula Vista Chamber of Commerce, AHA, American Hospital Association Regional Policy Board, South County Economic Development Council and SDADVS . Due to the COVID -19 pandemic, many organizations continued to meet virt ually. Certified by Planetree for excellence in person -centered care, SCVMC participated in the Planetree International Conference on Person -Centered Care in Anaheim, California, which focused on the topics of Restoring Ourselves; Rebuilding Trust & Enga gement ; and Creating a Healthier, Fairer, More Caring World. Held in May, the three -day conference included special interest educational sessions, keynote speakers, opportunities to connect and more. At the conference, five SCVMC nurses shared two posters on Com munity Engagement in Planning Person -Centered End -of-Life Care and The Ocean View Tower, High -Reliability & Person -Centered Care in Practice. In addition, SCVMC presented on the hospital's Community Care Partner Program, where volunteers act as care partne rs for patients without family at the bedside. Further, SCVMC hosted more than 20 hospital leaders from all over the world who attended the conference, sharing information about its Planetree designation and providing leaders with a tour of the hospi tal. In FY 202 2, Sharp planned to offer Spanish -language resources and educational opportunities to Hispanic or Latino community members and promotores (community Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 114 health workers) in the south region as part of the Conviva y Aprenda (Share and Learn) educ ational series, but the educational opportunities were paused due to the pandemic. In addition, in FY 2022, Sharp offered seven free Understanding Medicare webinars in Spanish, which featured specialists who explained how Medicare works and enrollment options, as well as provided the opportunity to ask questions. FY 202 3 Plan SCVMC will do the following:58 Share evidence -based health information via media relations, social media and other communication cha nnels as available Promote awareness and knowledge of health -related issues and resources impacting the community served by SCVMC, with an emphasis on needs iden tified in the SCVMC 2022 CHNA Conduct blood drives in partnership with the San Diego Blood Bank Assist community nonprofit organizations through coordination, support and fundraising activities Identified Community Need: Health Professions Education and Training, and Collaboration with Local Schools to Promote Interest and Career Pathways in Healt h Care Rationale references the findings of the SCVMC 2022 CHNA, HASD&IC 2022 CHNA or the most recent SDC community health statistics unless otherwise indicated . Rationale The HASD&IC 2022 CHNA identified workforce shortages as a foundational challenge that greatly exacerbates the priority health and social needs (access to health care, aging care & support, behavioral health, children & youth well -being, chron ic health conditions, community safety and economic stability) affecting community members serv ed by SCVMC. Workforce shortages were described by HASD&IC 2022 CHNA community engagement participants as the top priority for local health care providers. The pandemic has severely strained the existing health care workforce, and staffing shortages have e xacerbated challenges in meeting the demand for community services. All health care settings, including behaviora l health, were described as understaffed, and workforce shortages can adversely impact the patient experience. Further, the workforce shortage is creating a wider equity gap, with fewer culturally competent and linguistically appropriate providers availabl e to care for SDC's diverse communities. The IPH Sharp Provider and Sharp Human Resources surveys conducted as part of the SCVMC 2022 CHNA proc ess identified several educational topics of particular interest and importance to employee professional developm ent, including defining cultural humility and applying it to health care; the impact of implicit or unconscious Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 115 bias on decision -making; matern al and infant health with a focus on the Black community; and health disparities among various groups, including the Black, Asian, Latinx and immigrant communities. Nearly 90% of IPH Sharp Provider Survey participants reported that COVID -19 had at least a moderate impact in employees' desire to change careers or leave the workforce, which may create challenges in mee ting the health care needs of the community. Of these, the majority (78%) reported that Sharp does not have programs or services available to a ddress this issue. The San Diego Workforce Partnership (SDWP) reported that in 2021, there were 186,000 people em ployed in the health care sector in SDC, accounting for 13% of all jobs countywide .72 SDWP also cites research by the University of Washington Center for Women's Welfare that estimates the basic needs of a single adult resident of SDC to cost $3,058.72 pe r month, requiring full -time employment at $17.65 an hour. Of the 20 most common occupations in SDC's health care sector, there are 11 with trai ning requirements less than or equal to an associate degree that can provide new graduates with a living wage .72 Total employment in California is projected to grow 16% between 2020 and 2030 , reflecting an inc rease of 2.8 million jobs statewide over the decade. The educational services (private), health care and social assistance sector is expected to be one of the fastest -growing industries in California, with 19.0% growth anticipated .73 According to the U.S. B ureau of La bor Statistics' Employment Projections - 2021- 2031 report, employment in health care and social assistance is projected to add about 2.6 million jobs from 202 1 to 203 1 \u2014 the highest growth among all industry sectors. Factors that are expected to contribute to this growth include rising demand for the care of an aging baby -boom population, longer life expectancies and higher prevalence of chronic conditions.74 According to a report from the California Health Care Foundation (CHCF ) titled California Physicians: A Portrait of Practice , the supplies of physicians, physician assistants and three types of advanced practice nurses in California grew between 2016 and 2020, while the supply of clinical nurse specialists decreased. The increased supply of li censed physicians does not accurately reflect the availability of care, however \u2014 less than half of California's physicians provided care 40 or more hours per week .75 According to a report titled Health Workforce Strategies for California, studies conducted over the past four decades demonstrate that multi -component pipeline programs for high school, college and post -baccalaureate students underrepresented in the health professions positively impact a variety of outcomes with the potential to improv e the div ersity of the health care workforce .76 Although California has enacted various policies to increase both the size and the diversity of the health workforce, current public and private sector efforts have not been sufficient to alleviate existing shortages .76 72 San Diego Workforce Partnership (2021), Expa nding Access to Healthcare Jobs in San Diego County: Healthcare Sector Overview. 73 California Employment Development Department ( EDD) (2022), Employment Projections. 74 U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (2022), Employment Projections - 2021 -2031 . 75 Founda tion (CHCF) Physicians, 2021: A Portrait of Practice. 76 CHCF (2021), Health Workforce Strategies for California: A review of the E vidence. Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 116 The California Future Health Workforce Commission (CFHWC) has described several recent state budget and policy actions intended to a ddress the significant health and economic impacts of the COVID -19 pandemi c. This includes investments in the mental health workforce, particularly for those who work with children and youth; investments in physician residencies, with an emphasis on psychi atry; additional California Department of Health Care Access and Informati on77 oversight for state -supported health workforce programs; expanding the scope of practice for nurse practitioners; and creating several new reimbursable provider types, such as community health workers.78 According to CFHWC key informant interviews with private sector health care leaders, California's workforce needs include increasing workforce diversity; educating young Californians that futures in the health sector are appeali ng regardless of background, socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity, and gender ; and partnering with schools and companies to remove barriers to continuing education and develop pipelines for jobs .79 A CHCF survey of frontline health care workers during COV ID-19 reflects the sustained mental and emotional toll of providing patient ca re during the pandemic. Six in 10 providers continue to feel overworked and burned out, while nearly half are frustrated by their job. Nearly three out of four nurses (72%) say t hey feel burned out from their work \u2014 higher than the 61% reported among nurse practitioners and physician assistants, 57% among doctors, and 56% among behavioral health specialists .80 Objective In collaboration with local schools, colleges and universit ies offer opportunities for students to explore a vast array of health care pro fessions FY 202 2 Report of Activities In FY 202 2, SCVMC collaborated with local, state and national schools, colleges and universities to provide hospital -based opportunities for students to explore and train for a variety of careers in health care. Alth ough still significant, in FY 202 2, student participation in these programs remained low er than pre -pandemic levels because of interruptions to on -site learning related to COVID -19. These circumstances also impacted SCVMC's partnership with HSHMC \u2014 the program remained paused through August. In September, 45 HSHMC students in grades nine, 11 and 12 were welcomed back to SCVMC's campus . The students began their internship experience with an orientation and spent 450 hours rotating through instructional pods in specialty areas, including but not limited to nursing; emergency services; maternal i nfant medical/surgical; rehabilitation; laboratory 77 California's Department of Health Care Access and Information was formerly known as the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development . 78 California Future Health Workforce Commission (CFHWC) (2022), January 2022 Update on Health Workforce Progress. 79 CFHWC (2020), Meeting the Demand for Health: Top Priorities, Challenges, and Proposed Actions for the Private Sector to Support the Workforce Cal ifornia Needs. 80 CHCF (2021), COVID -19 Tracking Poll, May 2021 Views from California Health Care Providers on the Front Lines . Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 117 services; pharmacy; cardiac care; engineering; nutrition ; administration; and general operations. In FY 2 022, SCVMC provided more than 59,400 hours of training and supervision for more than 440 students pursuing health care careers. Students came from colleges and universi ties throughout the community, including Azusa Pacific University, California College Sa n Diego, California State University San Marcos (CSUSM), Chapman University, Concordia University, Grossmont College, Grossmont Health Occupations Center , Keck Graduate Institute, Pima Medical Institute, Point Loma Nazarene University ( PLNU ), San Diego City College, San Diego Mesa College, San Diego State University ( SDSU ), San Joaquin Valley College, Southwestern College (SWC) , University of San Diego (USD) , Western Uni versity of Health Sciences and Western Governors University . In addition, S CVMC continued to partner with Midwestern University in Glendale, Arizona , to provide physician -led mentorship opportunities for medical students, serving 10 students in FY 202 2. More than 330 nursing students dedicated more than 26,400 hours to clinical rotations and individual training with hospital preceptors in FY 202 2. Nursing students sought degrees ranging from associate level to Master of Science in Nursing and represented a range of specialties , including social work, dietetics, clinical or medical laboratory science, health informatics and more. After a short pause in FY 2021 due to the COVID -19 pandemic, SCVMC resumed its partnership with SWC by training nursing students enrolled in the Integrative Therapies Collaborative, an innovative externship program developed between the two organizations and offered as an elective by SWC. Through the program, students receive training for relaxation therapies, including hand massage , aromatherapy and music for healing. Students visit pat ient rooms on each nursing unit as well as hospital waiting areas, the Barnhart Cancer Center and Birch Patrick Skilled Nursing Facility, where they nurture and interact with patients to help create a relaxing environment. SCVMC trained two students , who offered 120 hours of service, through the Integrative Therapies Collaborative in FY 202 2. In FY 2022, SCVMC provided more than 800 hours of supervision, training, lectures and support to pharmacy stud ents. The hospital invited 28 students i n advanced pharmacy practice to participate in rotations as well as provided over 1,000 hours of training to eight post -graduate year one Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm.D .) residents. SCVMC also provided information to hu ndreds of Pharm.D. candidates, residents , students and interns about the education and training opportunities offered by the hospital's residency program. Education was provided through participation in virtual showcases, educational sessions, poster prese ntations and lectures at various schools and state and national conferences. SCVMC also virtually conducted 36 half -day personal interviews for pharmacy residency candidates in February, after receiving and processing approximately 100 applications. Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 118 Annu ally, the SCVMC Social Services Departme nt offers a nine -month internship for Master of Social Work (MSW) students through a longtime partnership with SDSU, CSUSM and University of Southern California. In FY 2022, the department hosted five MSW students fr om SDSU. Students worked alongside licen sed medical social workers to provide counseling, crisis intervention, bereavement, general emotional support, psychosocial assessment and problem solving; evaluate protective service concerns and mandated reporting for domestic violence and to child and adult protective services; provide educational services to enhance patient understanding of illness, disability and coping methods; act as a resource to physicians and hospital staff for patient treatment and discharg e planning, including the discussion of environmental factors and age - related issues; and provide referrals to community agencies. Further, the students rotated through various hospital units and participated in and facilitated rounds and conferences to un derstand the social, emotional and devel opmental functions of patients and their environment. SCVMC continually assesses and identif ies additional opportunities to enhance the internship for both the students and the patients whom SCVMC serve s. In July, a n SCVMC nurse presented to approximately 50 palliative care professionals at CSUSM's 5 th Annual Professional Palliative Care Conference. The conference theme was Building Bridges: Connecting our Communities to Palliative Care, focusing on the promotion of ACP and access to palliativ e care, especially for San Diego's underserved community members. The conference offered panels, workshops and presentations, including education from an SCVMC nurse discussing the initiation of early goals of care conversations in the ED and special consi derations for vulnerable populations . In August, an SCVMC nurse participated as an expert panelist for the San Diego Chapter of the Association of California Nurse Leaders' Beyond the Bedside event at the Riverwalk Golf Club in M ission Valley. Approximatel y 60 community members attended the event, where expert panelists discussed opportunities that exist for nurses, including those beyond the bedside. In addition, SCVMC provided lectures on epidemiology and health care finance to both USD and PLNU doctoral students throughout FY 2022. Approximately 40 students attended the lectures, which were offered virtually and in - person at USD. Additionally, the Sharp Diabetes Education Program provided education to several students througho ut FY 2022. In September, the Sharp Diabetes Education Program provided virtual diabetes education on the different types of diabetes, diagnoses, current technology and medication, community resources for patients, patient education modalities and careers in diabetes to more than 20 dietetic students at SDSU. The Sharp Diabetes Education Program also mentored two dietetic interns from the San Diego Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) Dietetic Internship program. The director of the Sharp Diabetes Education P rogram served as a board member of the San Diego WIC Dietetic Internship program in FY 202 2 and provided a presentation on diabetes care, the role of the dietitian, the different types of diabetes, nutrition and meal planning, diabetes and technology and m ore to all six interns in the program. In September, the program director participated in a career panel d iscussing careers in dietetics, including outpatient diabetes care, to approximately 50 dietetics students at the California Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 119 Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Career Fair at PLNU. During the panel's question - and-answer session, attendees were able to ask questions about panelists' experiences in the field of dietetics . With a theme of Mo ving Forward and Uniting Together, the California Association of Hospitals and Health Systems' 2022 California Hospital Volunteer Leadership Virtual Conference in February reflected on connectivity and the importance of adapting programs for the current health care landscape. At the conference, SCVMC's Volunteer Service s Manager participated on a panel that discussed adapting volunteer programs during the COVID -19 pandemic as well as offered a question -and-answer session. SCVMC also presented on the hospital's Patient Activity Companion (formerly the Community Care Partn er Caller ) program, which was in effect from August 2020 to July 2021 and resumed in FY 2022 . Through this program, volunteer patient companions, who provided in -person visits to the patient's bedside prior to the COVID -19 pandemic, were transformed to vir tual community care partners to uphold their commitment and connection to patients. The program was then t ransitioned back to in -person in FY 2022, offering friendly visits at the patient's bedside as well as reading materials, arts and crafts engagement, word puzzles and more. More than 100 volunteers, staff who manage volunteer programs, community partners a nd interprofessional peers looking to expand their services with volunteer programs attended the conference . As a part of Healing Touch California, a network for all Healing Touch energy therapy practitioners and students, SCVMC offered a monthly Healing Touch practice/support group for community members who have taken Healing Touch Level 1 or higher. This space provided an opportunity for attendees t o enhance their development as healers, network with other students and practitioners, practice their skills and techniques, share treatments, exchange healing sessions and receive support and encouragement on their Healing Touch energy therapy journey. On average, six to 10 people participated each month, and sessions were offered both virtually and in -person. FY 202 3 Plan SCVMC will do the following:58 Collaborate with local and regional colleges, universiti es and vocational programs to train and mentor health care students, including providing clinical rotations for nursing, radiology, social work and pharmacy Provide high school students and recent graduates with opportunities to experience the hospital wor k environment Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 120 Identified Community Need: Access to Health Care and Community and Social Support Rationale references the findings of the SCVMC 2022 CHNA, HASD&IC 2019 CHNA or the most recent SDC community health statistics unless otherwise indicated . Rationale The HASD&IC and SCVMC 2022 CHNAs identified access to health care and economic stability among the priority health and social needs affecting the community members served by SCVMC, particularly underserved and underfunded patients who face in equities. The HASD&IC and SCVMC 2022 CHNA s identified the following themes related to accessing health care in SDC: overall barriers to care; the impact of telehealth; health literacy; transportation; health insurance and financial concerns; stigma; the needs of specific populations ( LGBTQ+ , people experiencing homelessness, individuals at the end of life, undocument ed individuals, and parents or caregivers); the need for trauma -informed care; and workforce challenges. HASD&IC 2022 CHNA participants also de scribed the following logistical challenges related to accessing health care: making primary care appointments or accessing their usual source of care; insurance restrictions and confusion; a need for referrals to access certain services or treatments; fin ding the right fit with a provider; and timeliness related to level of care, such as locating after -hours urgent care. Across HASD&IC's interviews and focus groups, there was a universal acknowledgment that the COVID -19 pandemic caused widespread disrupti on to SDC's local health care system. Factors impacting the ability to access health care included postponed or c anceled procedures, long wait times for appointments and the fear of COVID -19 exposure. Nearly all (99%) IPH Sharp Provider Survey participant s reported COVID -19 had an impact on patients' access to transportation, which may result in decreased access to health care. Strategies to address this included increasing community awareness about shuttle access or Sharp Van Services and providing telehe alth. According to the HASD&IC 2022 CHNA, financial concerns may deter patients from accessing health care. Finan cial assistance to help pay for medical bills was described as a frequent and significant need. Community members are not always aware of low o r no-cost programs that may be available to help pay for services. A primary theme across HASD&IC 2022 CHNA community engagement activities was the need for more culturally competent and linguistically appropriate care. Language was identified as a signif icant barrier for non -English speaking and limited English proficien cy community members to access care, and community members prefer receiving health care from providers who reflect their race and ethnicity. Translation services are not always adequate to help with patient -provider communication and trust, and use of thes e services may cause miscommunication. In FY 202 1, Sharp had over 38,000 behavioral health diagnoses among acute care hospital inpatients . Analysis of Sharp clinical data from FY 2016 -2021 showed a steady increase year -over-year, with a 12% increase since FY 2016 and 6% since Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 121 FY 2020. This increase is likely the result of both improved documentation and actual disease prevalence in the community. An analysis of ICD -10 (International Class ification of Diseases - 10th Revision) codes indicates that, in FY 2022, a total of 223 inpatients at SCVMC experienced homelessness \u2014 a 26.4% decrease compared to FY 2021 . In addition, in FY 2022, a total of 167 SCMVC inpatients had an ICD -10 diagnosis for problems related to living alone. In 2019, there were 643 ED visits related to mood disorders in SDC's south region; the age -adjusted rate was 124.4 per 100,000 population. Individuals ages 15 to 24 had a sign ificantly higher rate of ED visits for mood disorders compared to all other age groups (205.9 per 100,000 population).47 There were 552 ED visits for substance -related disorders in SDC's south region in 2019. The age -adjusted rate of ED visits for substa nce-related disorders was 111.8 per 100,000 population. In 2021 , 16.0% of south region adults, teens and children reported having no usual source of health care. In addition, 20.6% of south region residents reported that they had not visited a doctor at all in the previous year .43 According to the San Diego Hunger Coalition, while nutrition insecurity has declined since 2021, high rates remain due to long -standing economic disparities that were exacerbated by the COVID -19 pandemic . As of March 2022 , more than 1 in 4 San Diegans expe rienced nutrition insecurity, with disproportionate impacts noted among communities of color .40 As of September 2022 , the average unemp loyment rate in the south region cities of Bonita, Chula Vista, Imperial Beach and National City was 4.0%. This is higher than the rate for SDC overall ( 3.1%), California (3.8%), and the national rate (3.5%) during the same period.81 According to the San Di ego Regional Task Force on Homelessness' 2022 Point -in- Time Count, there was a 3% increase in SDC's unsheltered homeless population from 2020 to 2022. In 2022, 6% of SDC's homeless population resided in the south region.82 CHCF's 2022 M ental Health in Calif ornia: Waiting for Care report indicates that the prevalence of serious mental illness was highest among Californians with the lowest incomes. In 2019, nearly 1 in 12 adults in families with incomes below 100% of the FPL had serious me ntal illness .83 From 2 017 to 2019, California adults with mental illness were less likely to receive mental health services (36.8%) during the past year compared to the national rate (43.6%). In addition, the number of visits to California EDs that resulted in a discharge to ps ychiatric care increased 68% from 2011 to 2020.83 According to findings from the CHCF's 2022 California Health Policy Survey, half of Californians (49%) reported taking at least one action to delay, skip, or c ut back on care in the past 12 months because of concerns related to cost. Of those who delayed care due to cost, 47% reported that their health condition wor sened.84 81 California EDD (2022), Labor Market Information . 82 San Diego Regional Taskforce on Homelessness (2022), San Diego County WeAllCount Point -in-Time Count. 83 CHCF (2022), Mental Health in Waiting for Care. 84 CHCF (2022), The 2022 CHCF California Health Policy Survey. Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 122 An epidemiologic cross -sectional study published in Journal of the American Medical Associ ation Psychiatry suggests that the COVID -19 pandemic has negatively affected adult mental health, with racial and ethnic minoritized groups disproportionatel y affected. From January 2019 to August 2021, EDs experienced increases in mental health -related vi sits both during and after COVID -19 case surges, with the most significant results among Asian and American Indian or Alaska Native persons, as well as young adults ages 18 -24 years.85 Objectives Promote patient empowerment and e stablish a medical home f or the safety net patient population in SDC's south region Provide assessment and early intervention for behavioral health issues as well as identify s ocial determinants of health (SDOH) among safety net patients presenting in the ED Assist individuals wit h financial barriers through the provision of transportation, community clinic referrals, prescription cost assistance and connection to community services FY 202 2 Report of Activities In FY 2022, SCVMC continued to provide specialized programming to sup port low - income, uninsured and medically underserved patients in SDC's south region who receive care from SCVMC hospitalists. The program provided thes e patients with access and timely referrals to primary care and behavioral health services, as well as facilitated the establishment of medical homes (e.g., primary care) at community clinics, including Chula Vista Family Health Center and San Ysidro Healt h locations. SCVMC provided care and community resources to safety net patients with chronic conditions to help them better manage their pain, diseases and overall health. This included providing affordable medications through low -cost generic prescripti ons available at Costco and Walmart, as well as discount cards for select medications. Additional pharmac eutical assistance was provided through referrals to Sharp's pharmacy assistance program, which helps patients enroll in discount programs through pharmaceutical companies. Patients received additional resources including but not limited to medication assi stance through community clinics and programs for various conditions through County of San Diego Public Health Services. SCVMC provided assistance and resources for patients with limited access to transportation. Further, Sharp's Patient Access Services te am provides robust services to assist with access to care and health insurance coverage for patients at all Sharp hospitals, including patients of SCVM C. Please refer to Section 1 (Overview): Patient Access to Care Programs for more information on these programs and services. 85 Ande rson KN, Radhakrishnan L, Lane RI, et al. (2022). Changes and Inequities in Adult Mental Health -Related Emergency Department Visits During the COVID -19 Pandemic in the US. JAMA (J ournal of the 475 -485. DOI:10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2022.0164 Sharp Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 123 SCVMC's social services staff continued to provide safety net patients with comprehensive behavioral health services. Individuals who presented in the ED with severe mental illness received a mental hea lth evaluation, appropriate placement within the hospital and community , and referrals to community resources as needed. In FY 2022, more than 16,000 social service interventions were provided throughout the hospital as well as Birch Patrick Convalescent C enter \u2014 a skilled nursing facility (SNF) at SCVMC. Interventions include family conferences, psychosocial assessments, staff consultations, substance abuse and behavioral health counseling along with providing diverse re sources tailored to the patient's sp ecific needs. SCVMC's specialized programming establishes a higher standard of care delivery for nurses and doctors who handle exceptionally vulnerable patients. In FY 2022, SCVMC continued to collaboratively establish outpatient treatment plans with safe ty net providers for patients who frequent the ED and provide d these patients with education on the proper use of the ED. More than 600 patients in the ED and over 1,350 patients hospital -wide were treated specifically f or issues related to homelessness , and many of those patients also received substance use treatment. In addition, SCVMC's ongoing efforts to establish medical homes supports efforts to decrease the number of vulnerable community members using the hospital' s ED as a primary source of care, indicating improved access and quality of care for these individuals. In FY 2022, SCVMC continued its Music and Memory Program to provide interventions to long -term patients with memory impairments and dementia. The goal of the program is to improve specifi c behaviors, such as wandering, mood changes and agitation, and more. Beginning in FY 2020, SCVMC collaborated with the FHCSD's Downtown Homeless Navigation Center for increased support at discharge for individuals exp eriencing homelessness. SCVMC also c ollaborated with the County of San Diego to provide lodging for discharged patients with or under investigation for COVID -19 who were unable to self -isolate in the community. Further, SCVMC continued to partner with Alpha Project \u2014 a nonprofit organization that empowers individuals and families experiencing homelessness by providing work, recovery and support services to change their lives and achieve self -sufficiency \u2014 to coordinate shelter placement for at -risk homeless patients at SCVMC. Lastly, SCVMC co ntinued to offer its on -site, COVID -19 vaccination clinic for community members from October through April. From April through September, SCVMC 's pharmacy continued to offer COVID -19 vaccinations at no cost. New in FY 2022, SCVMC, along with all Sharp acu te care hospitals, joined the Bridge Medication -Assisted Treatment (MAT) program, which serves ED patients with opioid use disorder and mental health concerns. The goal is to better identify patients in need of MAT in Sharp EDs and to bridge their connecti on to treatment in the community. This program involves collaboration among a variety of professionals, including social workers, clinical informatics, ED nurses and Sharp -affiliated emergency medicine physici ans. Sharp partnered with a community organizat ion, Comprehensive Treatment Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 124 Centers, for prioritized access to treatment upon discharge from the ED. The California Bridge Grant was initially awarded to SGH and Sharp Memorial Hospital (SMH ) and was extended throughout the Sharp system. Diapers are exp ensive \u2014 a month's supply can cost up to $80 per child \u2014 and cannot be purchased with CalFresh or WIC benefits. As a result, parents with limited economic resources may change diapers less frequently than reco mmended and unintentionally place their infant at risk. In May 2019, SCVMC collaborated with the San Diego Food Bank ( Food Bank ) to help struggling families cope with this challenge by starting a Diaper Bank at SCVMC. This partnership provides diapers to l ow-income parents in SDC so they can remain emp loyed, provide for their families and help lift themselves out of poverty. Through this partnership, SCVMC distributed over 8,800 diapers to more than 170 families in need, serving nearly 180 children in the community in FY 2022 . SCVMC also distributes bab y wipes to families in need. Through the Community Closet program, the hospital provides weather -appropriate clothing and shoes to patients in need, including those experiencing homelessness, patients transferring to SNFs or patients who lack nearby frien ds or family upon discharge from the hospital. Most of these supplies come from the hospital's auxiliary, while other supplies are donated by the community. Beginning in FY 2019, SCVMC joined Sharp's systemwide pilot partnership with 2 -1-1's CIE to better understand and address the health equity barriers tha t influence the health and well -being of their patients. Research continues to underscore that SDOH have a significant impact on a person's ability to access care and maintain health. SCVMC joined the C IE pilot partnership to provide more informed, holisti c care to patients with challenges to health equity, and to connect them directly to community resources to meet those needs. Approximately 130 CIE community partners \u2014 including health care organizati ons, the County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency , housing networks, food banks and other social service agencies \u2014 use an integrated technology platform to support proactive, holistic, person -centered care. Shared records enable CIE partners to evaluate an individual's SDOH needs and utilization history of community services, and to make direct referrals to critical, community -based resources. SCVMC case managers and social workers were trained on CIE to better serve patients in the acute care setting, including patients who experience homelessnes s, food insecurity and other SDOH hardships. Although delays and obstacles to CIE implementation and adoption persisted due to the COVID -19 pandemic during Year 3 of the CIE pilot, utilization metrics were sustained after demonstrating growth between Year s 1 and 2. Community members across SDC were assisted through the CIE , including south region residents in Otay Mesa, National City and Chula Vista. The top community referrals provided to patients thro ugh the CIE included utilities, food, housing and econ omic support. Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 125 Sharp teams continue to work closely with 2 -1-1 on the implementation and data integration plans for CIE, which includes ongoing metrics, such as CIE utilization across the system, refer ral tracking, impact on case management efficacy and s uccessful connection to needed social services, health care utilization (e.g., inpatient readmissions, unnecessary ED visits, length of stay, etc.) and more. This data will be used to re -evaluate the va lue and sustainability of CIE for Sharp upon completio n of the pilot's fourth year. FY 202 3 Plan SCVMC will do the following : Promote ongoing c ollaborat ion with local community clinics to provide referrals and establish appointments for low -income, und erserved and uninsured individuals in the south region and continue inclusion of SCVMC transition planning Provide safety net patients with opportunities for e ducation on the proper use of the ED as well as help them establish medical homes Explore new fun ding opportunities for programs that assist safety net patients with establishing a medical home and connect them to community resources Participate in 2 -1-1's CIE program to serve patients who experience homelessness and other health equity barriers by co nnecting them to critical community services Partner with the Food Bank to provide free diapers and baby wipes to low -income parents in SDC Expand the Bridge M AT program at SCVMC Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 126 SCVMC Program and Service Highlights Advanced gastrointestinal endoscopy Ambulatory surgery center Bloodless surgery and medicine program Cancer care, including: Chemotherapy CoC-certified INCP External beam radiation therapy High -dose rate brachytherapy Intensity modulated radiation therapy Stereotactic body radiation therapy Stereotactic radiosurgery Surgery Cardiology and heart County -designated STEMI nal cardiology Open -heart surgery Robotic cardiothoracic surgery Stress testing Structural heart services (heart valve replacement and repair) Vascular surgery Chica's Caf\u00e9, offering healthy and nutritious food options for patients, famil ies and staff Clinical laboratory services Diagnostic imaging, including: Bone density testing CT and CT angiography Digital mammography General and vascular ultrasound General radiology Interventional radiology Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance angiography Nuclear medicine Positron emission tomography (PET) Emergency services FollowMyHealth\u00ae, a secure on -line patien t website that gives patients convenient, 24-hour access to their personal health information Home health86 86 Provided through Sharp Memorial Hospital Home Health Agency.

Costs for patients paid th rough the Medicare program on a prospective basis also include payments to third pa rties related to the specific population. 89 Charity care and bad debt reflect the unreimbursed costs of providing services to patients without the ability to pay for ser vices at the time the services were rendered. 90 \"Vulnerable populations\" means any population that is exposed to medical or financial risk by virtue of being uninsured, underinsured, or eligible for Medi -Cal, Medicare, Califor nia Children's Services Program, or county indigent programs. 91 Unreimbursed costs may include an hourly rate for labor and benefits plus costs for supplies, materials and other purchased services. Any offsetting revenue (such as fees, grants or external donations) is deducted from the costs of p roviding services. Unreimbursed costs were estimated by each department responsible for providing the program or service. Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 129 Figure 1 5: Percentage of Com munity Benefit by SB 697 Category Sharp Coronado Hospital and Healthcare Center \u2014 FY 202 2 Key highlights: Medical Care Services included uncompensated care for patients who were unable to pay for services and unreimbursed costs of public programs, such as Medi -Cal, Medicare and CHAMPVA/TRICARE.92 In FY 2020, the State of California and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services approved a Medi - Cal Hospital Fee Program for the time period of July 1, 2019, through December 31, 2021, and in FY 2022 the same agencies approved another Medi -Cal Hospital Fee Program for the time period of January 1, 2022 through December 31, 20 22. This resulted in recognition of net supplemental revenues for SCHHC totaling $ 12.0 million in FY 2022. This reimbursement helped offset prior years' unreimbursed medical care services; however, the additional funds recorded in FY 2022 understate the tr ue unreimbursed medical care services performed for the past fiscal year. 92 The Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs (CHAMPVA) is a health benefits program in which the De partment of Veterans A ffairs shares the cost of certain health care services and supplies with eligible beneficiaries. T RICARE is a health care program of the U.S. Department of Defense Military Health System , which provides civilian health benefits for U.

Other Benefits for the Broader Community included education and information on a variety of health topics, participation in community events, flu vaccinations, collaboration with local schools to promote student interest and career path ways in health c are, and provision of meeting room space for community activities. In addition, SCHHC staff actively participated in community boards, committees and other civic organizations, including the San Diego Chapter of the California Association M edical Staff Ser vices (CAMSS), Association of California Nurse Leaders (ACNL), County of San Diego Health Services Capacity Task Force, San Diego Blood Bank Board of Directors, Rotary Club of Coronado, Safe Harbor Coronado (formerly Coronado SAFE), Coronad o Senior Plannin g Committee, Coronado Chamber of Commerce, Neighbor 2 Neighbor, San Diego Education Collaborative and the San Diego Black Nurses Association. See Appendix A for a list of Sharp's involvement in community organizations in FY 202 2. This category also includes costs associated with planning and operating community benefit programs, such as community health needs assessment (CHN A) development and participation. Health Research, Education and Training Programs included time devoted to education and training for health care professionals as well as student and intern supervision. Definition of Community SCHHC is located at 250 Prospect Place in Coronado, ZIP code 92118. The communities served by SCHHC include the city of Coronado, Downtown San Diego and the incorporated city of Imperial Beach. Notably, most Coronado residents use SCHHC. Coronado is connected to central San Diego by a bridge to the east and an isthmus known as the Silver Strand to the south. SCHHC is geographically isolated and locate d in central Coronado, which includes hotels, shops, single -family homes, condominiums and apartments. Coronado also includes Coronado Cays, a marina community located on the isthmus. In addition to these communities, there are six mil itary sites in Coro nado, including one of the largest Naval Commands with housing located both on - and off -base. Downtown San Diego and Imperial Beach are in close proximity to Coronado. Certain secondary data sources are not available at this level of spe cificity, and, in t hese cases, broader summaries of San Diego County (SDC) are provided. See Appendix B for a map of community and region boundaries in SDC. Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 131 For SCHHC's 2022 CHNA process, the Dignity Health/ IBM Watson Health C ommunity Need Index (CNI) was used to identify communities within its service area that experience greater health inequities .93,94 The CNI uses demographic and economic statistics to provide a \"CNI score\" for every populated ZIP code in the U.S. CNI scores measure inequity on a scale ranging from very low health inequity to very high health inequity. This measurement is an average determined through an analysis of specific socio -economic barriers to health care access, includi ng education, income, culture/lan guage, insurance , and housing. As such, the CNI demonstrates the link between community need, access to care and preventable hospitalizations. According to the CNI, communities served by SCHHC with especially high need in clude Chula Vista, Imperial Beach , National City , El Cajon, Downtown San Diego, East San Diego, Southeast San Diego, Encanto, Otay Mesa, and San Ysidro .93 Figure 16 presents a map of the CNI findings across SDC. 93 Dignity Health and IBM Watson Health Community Need Index (CNI) (2022). The Dignity Health and IBM Watson CNI was discontinued on January 31, 2023. 94 According to the World Health Organization ( WHO ), health inequities are differences in health status or in the distribution of health resources between different population groups arising from the social conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work and age. These inequities have significant social and economic costs both to individuals and societies (WHO, 2018). Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 132 Figure 16: CNI Map \u2014 SDC95 Description of Community Health In 2022, there were 525,919 residents ages 65 and older in SDC, representing 15.8% of the population. Between 2022 and 2027, it is anticipated that SDC's senior population will grow by 14.1%. Further, individuals ages 65 a nd older make up 20.9% of Coronado Island's population, while adults ages 45 to 64 make up 19.8%. Between 2022 and 2027, the senior population is projected to grow by 13.8% on Coronado Island and by 14.6% in SCHHC's service area, which includes Coronado Is land, Imperial Beach and Otay Mesa , among other communities.96 Given the unique geography and demographic composition of SCHHC, many of the hospital's services address the health needs of older adults. 95 Truven Health Analytics, 2022; Insurance Coverage Estimates, 2022; The Nielson Company, 2022; and CNI, 2022. 96 SpeedTrack\u00a9, Inc.; U.S. C ensus Bureau. Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 133 In 2020 , 10.9% of the SDC population reported living below 100% of the federal poverty level (FPL). The county's unemployment rate was 5.9% and 5. 1% of households received Supplemental Security Income.97 According to the San Diego Hunger Coalition, while nutrition insecurity98 has declined since 2021, high ra tes remain due to long -standing economic disparities that were exacerbated by the COVID -19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic . As of March 2022, 28% of San Diegans experienced nutrition insecurity and 35% of children lived in nutrition -insecure households .99 In 2020 , 7.1% of households in SDC received Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, while 16.7% of the population lived at or below 138% FPL and were eligible for the program.97 Please re fer to Table 22 for SNAP participation and eligibility in SDC.

Please refer to Section 3: Community Benefit Planning Process for a detailed description of Sharp's process and findings. Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 136 In addition, this year SCHHC updated its implementation strategy \u2014 a description of SCHHC programs designed to address the priority health and social needs identified in the 2022 CHNA. Through the SCHHC 2022 CHNA, the following pr iority health and social needs were identified for the communities served by SCHHC (listed in alphabetical order): Access to Health Care Aging Care & Support Behavioral Health Children & Youth Well -being Chronic Health Co nditions Community Safety Economic Stability The following pages detail SCHHC programs, activities and services that specifically address these needs, either directly or indirectly. Please refer to Section 1 (Overview): Patient Access to Care Program s for additional entity and systemwide programs designed to address access to health care. Considering the significant number of adults and older adults who compose the community served by SCHHC (adults ages 45 to 65 and older, nearly 40%),96 many of SCHHC's programs focus on aging concerns. However, SCHHC also addresses chronic health conditions by providing ed ucation and healthy lifestyle programs as part of care cardiovascular disease (CVD ), diabetes, obesity and other health issues influenced by healthy weight and exercise. As a part of the Sharp system, SCHHC collaborates with the greater organization to address identified needs beyond SCHHC's capacity, including behavioral hea lth and substance use. Community education and support elements of behavioral health are addressed through the programs and services provided by Sharp Mesa Vista Hospital (SMV) and Sh arp McDonald Center, which are the major providers of behavioral health and substance use treatment services in SDC. Please refer to Section 11 of this report for details on those programs. SC HHC has collaborated with SMV in recent years and continues to explore those opportunities as capacity allow s. For additional details on SCHHC programs that specifically address the needs identified in the 2022 CHNA, please refer to SCHHC's implementatio n strategy . The most recent CHNA and implementation strategy for SCHHC are available at http://www.sharp.com/about/community/health -needs -assessments.cfm . For each priority community need identified above, subsequent pages include a summary of the rationale and importance of the ne ed, objective(s), FY 2022 Report of Activities conducted in support of the objective(s) and FY 2023 Plan. Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 137 Identified Community Need: Health Education, Screening and Support Activities Rationale references the findings of the SCHHC 2022 CHNA, HASD&IC 202 2 CHNA or the most recent SDC community health statistics unless otherwise indicated. Rationale The HASD&IC and SCHHC 2022 CHNAs identified access to health care, aging care & support, behavioral health, children & youth well -being, chronic health condit ions, community safety, a nd economic stability as the priority health and social needs affecting the community members served by SCHHC. The Institute for Public Health's (IPH) Sharp Provider Survey conducted as part of the SCHHC 2022 CHNA identified increa sed isolation among seniors as one of the top clinical and social needs most seriously impacted by COVID -19 in the past year. Sharp Insight Community Survey respondents ages 6 5 and older also reported experiencing a decrease in access to social support due to COVID -19. Survey participants suggested the following strategies to address increased isolation among seniors/older adults: finding ways to allow visitation during COVID -19; establishing or expanding home visiting and other follow -up services; expandin g or resuming services for seniors; offering more patient education and referrals; improving access to technology; and providing support for caregivers. The majority (96%) of Sharp Insight Community Survey respondents did not participate in Sharp's progra ms to connect individuals to support services or resources, which suggests that more can be done to promote community awareness about these services. Among those who did parti cipate, programs accessed included: diabetes care and education programs (12%) , nutrition programs (6%) and weight management programs (6%). In FY 2021, 349 patients were admitted to SCHHC with COVID -19. Among these patients, 67.3% had hypertension, 55.6% had diabetes and 43.3% were obese (body mass index (BMI) of 30.0 or higher). In 2020, cancer was the leading cause of death in SDC, followed by diseases of the heart and COVID -19.103 In 2019, the 10 leading causes of death among adults age 65 years and older in SDC were diseases of th e heart, cancer, Alzheimer's disease, cerebrovascular diseases (including stroke), chronic lower respiratory diseases, diabetes, accidents/unintentional injuries, essential hypertension and hypertensive renal disease, Parkinson's disease and influenza or p neumonia.105 In 2019, there were 6,500 hospitalizations for stroke in SDC (for all SDC hospitals). The age -adjusted rate of hospitalizations for stroke was 177.5 per 100,000 population. In addition, there were 2,828 stroke -related emergency department (ED) visits countywide in 2019. The age -adjusted rate of ED visits was 76.7 per 100,000 population. In 2019, the number of osteoarthritis -related hospitalizations in SDC (all hospitals) totaled 8,005 \u2014 an age -adjusted rate of 212.5 per 100,000 population.

Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 138 age 65 years and older represented the highest hospitalization rate for arthritis when compared to all other age groups, at 1,106.1 per 100,000 population. According to 2021 CHIS data, 21.7% of SDC adults reported being obese.102 In California, the self -reported obesity rate in 2020 was 30.3%. Prevalence of obesity decreased as education levels increased, highlighting the need for health education as a tool for reducing obesity rates.106 A study published in t he Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 's (CDC ) Morbidity and Mortality Weekly suggests that risks of COVID -19-related hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, inva sive mechanical ventilation, and death are higher with increasing BMI, pa rticularly among adults under the age of 65.107 According to the CDC, the leading causes of preventable death include obesity - related conditions, such as heart disease, stroke, Type 2 diabetes and some types of cancer.108 The CDC also reported that more than 795,000 people in the U.S. have a stroke each year, and strokes are responsible for approximately 1 out of every 6 deaths from CVD .109 Projections show that by 2030 an additional 3.4 million U.S. adults ages 18 and older (3.9% of the adult population) will have had a stroke \u2014 a 20.5% increase in prevalence compared to 2012.110 Many lifestyle -related factors have been linked to colorectal cancer, including being overweight or obese, lack of physical activity, diet, smoking and alcohol use. To reduce the risk of colorectal cancer, the American Cancer Society recommends regular screening for individuals over the age of 45, as well as maintaining a healthy body weight, physica l activity level and diet.111 According to the CDC, more than 53 million people in the U.S. either already have osteoporosis or are at high risk due to low bone mass.112 Along with the financial costs, osteoporosis can reduce quality of life for many people who suffer from fractures. Preventable risk factors for osteoporosis include smoking, alcoho l consumption and medication and vitamin intake.113 According to the Harvard University T.H. Chan School of Public Health, mindful eating can be an effective tool in the treatment of emotional eating and binge eating, which can lead to weight gain and obesi ty. Mindfulness addresses the shame and guilt associated with these behaviors by focusing on eating experiences, body - related sensations and though ts and feelings about food, with heightened awareness and without judgment.114 106 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) (2022), Adult Obesity Prevalence Maps. 107 Kompaniyets L., Goodman A.B., Belay B., et al.

Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 139 Objectives Provide community education addressing CHNA -identified health needs, including chronic conditions (e.g., obesity, diabetes, cancer and CVD), aging concerns, uninten tional injury and health literacy Participate in community events Provide fundraising support for nonprofit he alth organizations Provide community health screenings that respond to CHNA -identified chronic health conditions FY 2022 Report of Activities In FY 2022, SCHHC actively supported the health and well -being of nearly 2,500 San Diego and Coronado communit y members through health education and screenings addressing a range of health needs, including many of those identified in the SCHHC 2022 CHNA. F ollowing eased pandemic restrictions, most programs were offered in - person at community sites while others rem ained virtual in FY 2022. SCHHC continued to collaborate with the John D. Spreckels Center and Bowling Green (Spreckels Center) to provide free h ealth education to community seniors. Education was provided on a variety of topics, including diabetes, menta l health, brain health, stroke awareness, pelvic floor disorders, healthy habits and exercise for weight loss, obstructive sleep apnea, mindful ea ting, musculoskeletal conditions and fall prevention. Education was shared in video format with over 1,200 rec ipients of the Spreckels Center's monthly digital newsletter, as well as approximately 160 community members through in -person presentations at th e Spreckels Center. In FY 2022, all in -person presentations integrated a variety of health screenings, includi ng fall risk, body composition using an Inbody 570 device, blood pressure and blood glucose. Further, most live presentations offered healthy eati ng resources, a cooking demonstration as well as healthy food samples prepared by the head chef of SCHHC's hos pital cafeteria, known as the Mindful Caf\u00e9. In November, SCHHC hosted a free presentation at the Spreckels Center titled Mindful Eating During t he Holidays. Led by a hospital registered dietitian, the class introduced the concept of mindful eating \u2014 a wa y to develop awareness from one's experiences, physical cues and feelings about food that can support weight loss, behavior change and stress redu ction \u2014 and how it can help individuals make healthy food choices during the holidays. Eight community members attended the event, where they enjoyed an appetizer created and served by SCHHC's head chef. In May, SCHHC hosted an in -person seminar at the S preckels Center titled The Golden Hour: How to Respond Quickly to a Stroke and Other Emergencies. Led by an SC HHC - affiliated emergency medicine physicians, the free event discussed the different types of strokes, common warning signs, and when to seek emer gency care as well as included a question -and-answer session. During the event, a Mindful Caf\u00e9 chef -led cookin g Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 140 demonstration, heart -healthy food samples, and blood pressure screenings were offered to approximately 25 community members. In addition, SCHH C partnered with the SunCoast Market Co -op to provide education to the Imperial Beach community on health and wellness topics requested directly by residents. The SunCoast Market Co -op is a grassroots effort to open a community - owned, full -service cooperat ive grocery store with a goal of strengthening the local food system, increasing residents' access to healthy food, and providing a needed retail outlet for small local farms and producers. In FY 2022, SCHHC provided flyers for the SunCoast Market Co -op to distribute and announce the hospital's virtual health presentations. In August and September, SCHHC participa ted in SunCoast Market Co - op's monthly community farmers market events, where SCHHC staff provided over 200 attendees with health education and re sources. Further, SCHHC provided attendees with information on hospital programs and services, including free and low -cost health and fitness classes, free organic gardening classes, community health education presentations at the Spreckels Center, hospita l volunteer opportunities and benefits, as well as walks at the hospital's outdoor labyrinth \u2014 a circular walk ing path intended to facilitate relaxation, healing and sense of well -being. To support skin cancer awareness and prevention, in September, a SCHHC -affiliated dermatologist provided education and resources to nearly 140 attendees of the annual Sharp Coron ado Hospital Foundation Golf Tournament. During the event, attendees received free sunscreen samples, protective sleeves and sun hats as well as information on skin cancer and how to practice sun safety. In FY 2022, the Sewall Healthy Living Center at Sha rp Coronado Hospital (Sewall Healthy Living Center) helped community members stay active and socially connected during the pandemic by providing daily Zoom and outdoor group fitness training and wellness classes. In FY 2022, SCHHC's virtual and in -person c lasses saw over 1,000 and 200 visits, respectively. Classes promoted stress relief, range of motion, balance, flexibility, and overall activities of daily living. Offerings were either free or a nominal fee and ranged from qigong, mat Pilates and yoga to s trength and balance, mindfulness, and cardio circui t training. In May, staff from the Sewall Healthy Living Center provided exercise and wellness education during the Sharp Women's Health Conference. A presentation titled Essential Elements for a Balance d You taught a variety of stretching, strengthening and meditation exercises, as well as simple lifestyle changes to help alleviate pain and discomfort and optimize the central nervous system. Another presentation, Tai Chi: Meditation in Motion, helped par ticipants discover the benefits of tai chi, includi ng improved balance, agility, strength and coordination, as well as decreased blood pressure, anxiety and pain. In addition, the Sewall Healthy Living Center shared videos, including What is Ear Acupunctur e, Six Steps to Relieve a Headache, and Three Simpl e Yoga Exercises, as well as provided the opportunity to chat with a physical therapist. Approximately 650 community members attended the conference. Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 141 Also in May, SCHHC participated in Safe Harbor Corona do's Mental Health Awareness Month event. The month -long initiative engaged a variety of community partners in promoting behavioral health awareness, especially during the COVID -19 pandemic, to community members of all ages. SCHHC contributed to the event by encouraging community members to schedule a walk around the hospital's outdoor labyrinth. Six community members participated in labyrinth walks through this effort. Further, in May, SCHHC offered a session on stress relief through music therapy to 20 at tendees at the Spreckels Center, where a board -certified music therapist combined music with stress reducing techniques, such as breathing and progressive muscle relaxation. During the summer months in FY 2022, SCHHC and clinicians from the Senior Intensi ve Outpatient Program at SMV conducted a series of in-person presentations on mental and brain health at the Spreckels Center. In June, attendees at the Caring for Caregivers event learned about strategies to help manage the challenges of caregiving, tips and tools to take care of the caregiver, and how to these tools to help loved ones. In July, attendees learned how to recognize signs and symptoms of depression and anxiety in later adulthood, as well as self -care tools to help lead a more balanced and fulfilling life during the Understanding Mental Health event. In August, attendees learned about cognitive functioning changes during the aging process and ways to love their brains at the Maintaining Brain Health event. Overall, approximately 25 community members attended each of these events. In addition , SCHHC participated in year -round fundraising activities \u2014 including sales featuring T-shirts, food and tickets to the Summer Splash water throw event and San Diego Seals Lacrosse game \u2014 in support of the American Heart Association's (AHA) 2022 San Diego Heart & Stroke Walk in September. Nearly 70 walkers, including SCHHC staff as well as friends and family, attended this event and were encouraged to walk along one of four pre -designated paths or create th eir own neighborhood route. Through these efforts, SCHHC raised more than $22,000 towards Sharp's total of nearly $180,000 for the AHA, while helping Sharp maintain its position as the top fundraising organization in San Diego. In addition to providing ed ucational classes and events, SCHHC used its Facebo ok page to help raise community awareness of common but serious health conditions, including the importance of taking preventive measures and not delaying care, especially during the pandemic. In recogniti on of Breast Cancer Awareness Month and National Ma mmography Day in October, SCHHC shared educational content and reminders about breast cancer detection and breast self -awareness. Throughout the year, SCHHC shared 18 articles in the local Coronado Eagle & Journal newspaper, providing timely health infor mation to approximately 12,500 homes and businesses in Coronado. Featuring SCHHC physicians, nurses and other caregivers, the articles covered various topics, including vaccines for flu and COVID -19; updat es on SCHHC renovations; women and heart disease; a nd the importance of mental health and wellness. To promote the value of physical health during the pandemic, articles Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 142 offered healthy recipes from the executive chef at SCHHC's Mindful Caf\u00e9 as well as information on the benefits of exercise. SCHHC keeps the community regularly informed about upcoming health classes and events through the internet, radio broadcasts, local journals and newspapers, posters in the hospital lobby, and flyers in physician offic es and at other community organizations. SCHHC also helps patients, families and community members locate reliable health information related to their diagnosis. Individuals can search relevant literature from high-quality websites using the hospital's com puter stations. In FY 2022, SCHHC leadership and h ospital staff contributed their time to several organizations, including the San Diego Chapter of the CAMSS, ACNL, County of San Diego Health Services Capacity Task Force, San Diego Blood Bank Board of Dir ectors, Rotary Club of Coronado, Safe Harbor Corona do, Coronado Chamber of Commerce, Coronado Senior Planning Committee, San Diego Education Collaborative and the San Diego Black Nurses Association. SCHHC continued its 17 -year collaboration with the Coun ty of San Diego E mergency Medical Services to provi de data for the SDC stroke registry, where data is tracked to identify gaps and determine trends. SCHHC also continued to actively participate in the quarterly San Diego County Stroke Consortium, a collabo rative effort with other SDC hospitals to improve s troke care and discuss issues impacting stroke care in SDC. The San Diego County Stroke Consortium consists of 18 hospitals \u2014including Sharp Memorial Hospital, SCHHC, Sharp Chula Vista Medical Center, Shar p Grossmont Hospital, Alvarado Hospital Medical Center, Kaiser San Diego Medical Center, Kaiser Zion Medical Center, Palomar Medical Center, Paradise Valley Hospital, Scripps Memorial Hospital Encinitas, Scripps Memor ial Hospital La Jolla, Scripps Mercy Hospital Chula Vista, Scripps Mercy Hospital San Diego, Temecula Valley Hospital, Tri - City Medical Center, University of California ( UC) San Diego Medical Center, and UC San Diego Medical Center - La Jolla \u2014 all of whic h are San Diego County Stroke Receiving Centers and certified by the Joint Commission. In response to the COVID -19 pandemic, meetings continued to be held virtually in FY 2022. FY 2023 Plan SCHHC will do the following:115 Develop virtual community education and fitness opportunities, including pre- recorded classes and workshops for anytime viewing Provide education and screenings at community and hospital events to support the identified community health needs of obesity, d iabetes, cardiovascular health, cancer, fall prevention, aging concerns, behavioral health and unintentional injury Collaborate with the Spreckels Center to provide health education to community members 115 Where applicable, Sharp Coronado Hospital and Healthcare Center ( SCHHC ) will perform these activities as COVID -19 (coro navirus disease 2019) public health and safety guidelines allow. Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 143 As invited, collaborate with local schools and first responders to provide community safety activities Explore opportunities to provide virtual behavioral health screenings and resources to community members in collaboration with SMV Expand education and outreach to the Logan Heights community Partner with the SunCoast Market Co -op in Imperial Beach to educate community members on a variety of wellness topics Explore opportunities to provide diabetes education and resources to the Coronado community Provide stroke education, screening and outreach to commu nity members via social media and in -person classes Participate in the Sa n Diego County Stroke Consortium Provide data to the SDC stroke registry Identified Community Need: Access to Health Care and Community and Social Support Rationale references the f indings of the SCHHC 2022 CHNA, HASD&IC 2022 CHNA or the most recent SDC community health statistics unless otherwise indicated. Rationale The HASD&IC and SCHHC 2022 CHNAs identified access to health care and economic stability among the priority health and social needs affecting the community members served by SCHHC, particu larly underserved and underfunded patients who face inequities. The HASD&IC and SCHHC 2022 CHNAs identified the following themes related to accessing health care in SDC: overall barriers to care; the impact of telehealth; health literacy; transportation; h ealth insurance and financial concerns; stigma; the needs of specifi c populations (LGBTQ+, people experiencing homelessness, individuals at the end of life, undocumented individuals, and parents or caregivers); the need for trauma -informed care; and workfo rce challenges. HASD&IC 2022 CHNA participants also described the fo llowing logistical challenges related to accessing health care: making primary care appointments or accessing their usual source of care; insurance restrictions and confusion; a need for r eferrals to access certain services or treatments; finding the right fit with a provider; and timeliness related to level of care, such as locating after -hours urgent care. Across HASD&IC's interviews and focus groups, there was a universal acknowledgment that the COVID -19 pandemic caused widespread disruption to SDC's local health care system. Factors impacting the ability to access health care included postponed or canceled procedures, long wait times for appointments and the fear of COVID -19 exposure. According to the IPH Sharp Provider Survey conducted as part of the SCHHC 2022 CHNA, 85% of participants reported that COVID -19 increased patients' fear about accessing healt h care. Participants also indicated that COVID -19 limited patients' Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 144 access to beha vioral health care (91%), specialty care (86%) and primary care (79%). Nearly all (99%) IPH Sharp Provider Survey participants reported COVID -19 had an impact on patients' a ccess to transportation, which may result in decreased access to health care. Stra tegies to address this included increasing community awareness about shuttle access or Sharp Van Services and providing telehealth. According to the HASD&IC 2022 CHNA, financ ial concerns may deter patients from accessing health care. Financial assistance t o help pay for medical bills was described as a frequent and significant need. Community members are not always aware of low or no -cost programs that may be available to help pay for services. According to 2 -1-1 San Diego's (2 -1-1) Community Information E xchange (CIE) 2021 Client Profile Report, the top five needs for 2 -1-1 clients ages 60 and older were (in rank order): housing, utilities, income support and employment, cons umer services, and health care.116 According to San Diego Association of Governments ' 2021 COVID -19 Impacts report, the top three ways Californians reported spending their stimulus checks included food (22%), utilities (16%), and rent (14%).117 According to the San Diego Hunger Coalition, while nutrition insecurity has declined since 2021, high rates still remain due to long -standing economic disparities that were exacerbated by the COVID -19 pandemic . As of March 2022, more than 1 in 4 San Diegans experienced nutrition insecurity, with disproportionate impacts noted among communities of colo r.100 As of September 2022, the overall unemployme nt rate in SDC was 3.1%, which was lower than both the unemployment rate for the state of California (3.8%) and the national rate (3.5%) during the same period .118 According to the San Diego Regional Task Force on Homelessness' 2022 Point -in- Time Count, the re was a 3% increase in SDC's unsheltered homeless population from 2020 to 2022. There were no fewer than 4,106 homeless individuals without shelter on a given night in 2022 compared to 3,971 in 2020. Of the 8,427 individuals experiencing homelessness in S DC in 2022, about half (51.2%) received some form of housing or services.119 In 2020, 1 in 4 unsheltered SDC residents were adults ages 55 and over. Among the region's unsheltered seniors, 88% became homeless in SDC and 43% reported experiencing homelessnes s for the first time in their lives.120 Nationwide, the population of individuals ages 65 and older experiencing homelessness is expected to nearly triple over the next decade \u2014 from 40,000 in 2020 to approximately 106,000 by 2030.121 According to findings from the California Health Care Foundation's (CHCF) 2022 California Health Policy Survey, half of Californians (49%) reported taking at least one action to delay, s kip, or cut back on care in the past 12 months because of 116 2-1-1 San Diego Community Information Exchange (20 21), Client Profile Report. 117 San Diego Association of Governme nts (2021), The San Diego Economy: A Year in Review of COVID -19 Impacts. 118 California Employment Development Department ( EDD) (2022), Labor Market Information. 119 San Diego Regional Taskforce on Homelessness (2022), San Diego County WeAllCount Point -in-Time Count. 120 Serving Seniors (2021), Senior Homelessness: A Needs Assessment. 121 University of Pennsylvania (2019), The Emerging Crisis of Aged Homelessness: Could Housing Solutions Be Funded by Avoidance of Excess Shelter, Hospital, and Nursing Home Costs? Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 145 concerns rel ated to cost. Of those who delayed care due to cost, 47% reported that their health condition worsened.122 According to the same survey, more than 1 in 4 lower -income Californians (30%) reported that it was \"somewhat\" or \"very\" difficult to find a provider who took their insurance, compared to 12% of Californians with higher incomes. In addition, among Californians with lower incomes, 4 in 10 reported being very worried about affording une xpected medical bills (42%), out -of-pocket costs (39%), rent or mortg age (41%), and transportation costs (40%). Objectives Provide free flu vaccinations to community members, including seniors Improve food security among vulnerable seniors through home -based meal delivery services Assist individuals experiencing economic hardship through financial assistance for transportation, pharmaceuticals, clothing and food Serve as a blood donation site in support of Sharp's systemwide blood drive effort Host a hol iday food drive to support the San Diego Food Bank (Food Bank ) Participate in 2 -1-1's CIE program to connect patients who experience homelessness and other health equity barriers to critical commu nity services FY 2022 Report of Activities SCHHC provides supportive programs that address a variety of social determinants of health (SDOH) \u2014 the conditions under which people live, learn, work and play \u2014 impacting seniors and community members with barriers to health equity , including access to health care, acc ess to healthy food and environmental health. SCHHC continued to provide individual s with economic support through its Project HELP financial assistance program, providing approximately $32,000 in free medication and transportation in FY 2022. SCHHC also provided over $131,000 in free valet services to improve patient, family and communi ty member access to the hospital. In addition, Sharp's Patient Access Services team provides robust services to assist with access to care and health insurance coverage for patients at all Sharp hospitals, including patients of SCHHC. Please refer to Section 1 (Overview): Patient Access to Care Programs for more information on these programs and services. To help protect community members fro m the flu virus, in October and November, SCHHC p rovided free seasonal flu vaccinations to more than 500 individuals at its annual community flu clinics. Through its Facebook page, SCHHC encouraged community members to receive free flu shots at their outdo or flu clinics, which offered both drive -up and w alk-up options. The clinics served the general community, the Coronado Fire Department and local nursing home staff on the island. Additionally, in FY 2022, SCHHC provided over 13,200 COVID -19 vaccinations, including members 122 California Health Care Foundation ( CHCF) (2022), The 2022 CHCF California Health Policy Survey. Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 146 of the general community at the Sharp Coronado Community Pharmacy as well as to residents of the Coronado Retirement Village. Also in FY 2022, SCHHC served as a blood donation site in support of Sharp's annual systemwide blood drive effort to collect life -saving blood for those wit h medical needs. SCHHC hosted blood drive events during the months of December, January, March, May, July and September. In FY 2022, the hospital collected more than 130 pints of blood, which has the potenti al to serve up to 390 people. For more than 30 years, SCHHC has helped deliver meals to the homes of vulnerable community seniors, including those who are homebound or living alone, and community members with disabilities. Beginning in 2016, SCHHC partne red with Meals on Wheels San Diego County to crea te the new Sharp Coronado Hospital Auxiliary Meals on Wheels Adopt -a-Route. This program provides more extensive services, including meals with enhanced nutritional quality, free pet food, in -home safety ass essments and sliding -scale payment options for th ose in need . Meals on Wheels San Diego County volunteers observe the client's environment for potential health and safety issues and use a secure mobile delivery application to communicate this information f or follow up. They are also trained to obtain eme rgency response if needed. This partnership helps promote independence, reduce social isolation, and improve the quality of life and health of participants. In FY 2022, SCHHC auxiliary members and volunteers provided nearly 5,800 meals to approximately 40 community members. During the 2021 holiday season, SCHHC partnered with the Food Bank to support community members experiencing food insecurity. Through its Sharp SuperFood Drive, the hospital collected ap proximately 620 pounds of food \u2014 the equivalent o f over 500 meals. Beginning in FY 2019, SCHHC joined Sharp's systemwide pilot partnership with 2 -1-1's CIE to better understand and address the barriers that impact the health and well -being of their patien ts. Research continues to underscore that SDOH ha ve a significant impact on a person's ability to access care and maintain health. SCHHC joined the CIE pilot partnership to provide more informed, holistic care to patients with challenges to health care acc ess and to connect them directly to community res ources to meet those needs. Approximately 130 CIE community partners \u2014 including health care organizations, the County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency , housing networks, food banks and other s ocial service agencies \u2014 use an integrated technology platform to support proactive, holistic, person -centered care. Shared records enable CIE partners to evaluate an individual's SDOH needs and history of community services utilization, and make direct re ferrals to critical, community -based resources. SCHHC case managers and social workers were trained on CIE to better serve vulnerable patients in the acute care setting, including patients who experience homelessness, food insecurity and other hardships. Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 147 Although delays and obstacles to CIE implementation and adoption persisted due to the COVID -19 pandemic during Year 3 of the CIE pilot, utilization metrics were sustained after demonstrating growth between Years 1 and 2. Community members across SDC were a ssisted through the CIE, and top community referrals included utilities, food, housing and economic support. Sharp teams continue to work closely with 2 -1-1 on the implementation and data integration plans for CIE, which includes evaluation of ongoing me trics, such as system utilization of CIE, referral tracking, case management efficiency, successful connection to community referrals and more. Data will be used to re -evaluate the value and sustainability of CIE for Sharp upon completion of the pilot's fo urth year. In FY 2022, SCHHC reopened its on -site, certified organic fruit, vegetable and herb garden. The ga rden provides nutritious ingredients for the hospital's Mindful Caf\u00e9, as well as serves as an educational tool to teach community members how to start an organic garden through free gardening classes. Four classes were conducted in FY 2022, serving nearly 20 community members in total. FY 2023 Plan SCHHC will do the following:115 Administer Project HELP funds to those in need Provide free flu va ccinations, including drive -thru and walk -up options at SCHHC's annual community flu clinic Serve as a blood donation site in support of Sharp's systemwide blood drive effort With Meals on Wheels San Diego Cou nty, administer the Sharp Coronado Hospital Auxiliary Meals on Wheels Adopt -a-Route to provide daily meals and in -home safety assessments for seniors and community members with disabilities Host a holiday food drive to support the Food Bank Participate in 2-1-1's CIE program to connect patients who ex perience homelessness and other health equity barriers to critical community services Provide community education on gardening basics at SCHHC's on -site garden, including to members of the Imperial Beach commu nity in partnership with the SunCoast Market Co -op Expand GrubHub/Mindful Caf\u00e9 partnership Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 148 Identified Community Need: Health Professions Education and Training, and Collaboration with Local Schools to Promote Interest and Career Pathways in Health Care Rationale references the findings of the SCHHC 2022 CHNA, HASD&IC 2022 CHNA or the most recent SDC community health statistics unless otherwise indicated. Rationale The HASD&IC 2022 CHNA identified workforce shortages as a foundational challenge t hat greatly exacerbates the priority health and social needs (access to health care, aging care & support, behavioral health, children & youth well -being, chronic health conditions, community safety and economic stability) affecting community members serve d by SCHHC. Workforce shortages were described by HASD&IC 2022 CHNA community engagement participa nts as the number one priority for local health care providers. The pandemic has severely strained the existing health care workforce, and staffing shortages have exacerbated challenges in meeting the demand for community services. All health care settings , including behavioral health, were described as understaffed, and workforce shortages can adversely impact the patient experience. Further, the workforce sho rtage is creating a wider equity gap, with fewer culturally competent and linguistically appropria te providers available to care for SDC's diverse communities. The IPH Sharp Provider and Sharp Human Resources surveys conducted as part of the SCHHC 2022 CH NA process identified several educational topics of particular interest and importance to employee professional development, including: defining cultural humility and applying it to health care; the impact of implicit or unconscious bias on decision -making ; maternal and infant health with a focus on the Black community; and health disparities among var ious groups, including the Black, Asian, Latinx and immigrant communities. Nearly 90% of IPH Sharp Provider Survey participants reported that COVID -19 had at least a moderate impact on employees' desire to change careers or leave the workforce, which may create challenges in meeting the health care needs of the community. Of these, the majority (78%) reported that Sharp does not have programs or services avail able to address this issue. The San Diego Workforce Partnership (SDWP) reported that, in 2021, th ere were 186,000 people employed in the health care sector in SDC, accounting for 13% of all jobs countywide.123 SDWP also cites research by the University of Washington Center for Women's Welfare that estimates the basic needs of a single adult resident of SDC to cost $3,058.72 per month, requiring full -time employment at $17.65 an hour. Of the 20 most common occupations in SDC's health care sector, there are 1 1 with training requirements less than or equal to an associate degree that can provide new graduates with a living wage.123 123 San Diego Workforce Partnership (2021), Expanding Acces s to Healthcare Jobs in San Diego County: Healthcare Sector Overview. Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 149 Total employment in California is projected to grow 16% between 2020 and 2030, reflecting an increase of 2.8 million jobs statewide over the decade. The educational services (private), health care and social assistance sector is expected to be one of the fastest -growing industries in California, with 19.0% growth anticipated.124 According t o the U.S. Bureau of La bor Statistics' Employment Projections - 2021 - 2031 report, employment in health care and social assistance is projected to add about 2.6 million jobs from 2021 to 2031 \u2014 the highest growth among all industry sectors. Factors that are expected to contribute to this growth include rising demand for the care of an aging baby -boom population, longer life expectancies and higher prevalence of chronic conditions.125 According to a report from the CHCF titled California Physicians: A Portrait of Practice , the suppl ies of physicians, physician assistants and three types of advanced practice nurses in California grew between 2016 and 2020, while the supply of clinical nurse specialists decreased. The increased supply of licensed physicians does n ot accurately reflect the availability of care, however \u2014 less than half of California's physicians provided care 40 or more hours per week.126 According to a report titled Health Workforce Strategies for California, studies conducted over the past four deca des demonstrate that multi -component pipeline programs for high school, college and post -baccalaureate students underrepresented in the health professions positively impact a variety of outcomes with the potential to improve the diversity of the health car e workforce.127 Although California has enacted various policies to increase both the size and the diversity of the health workforce, current public and private sector efforts have not been sufficient to alleviate existing shortages.127 The California Future Health Workforce Commission (CFHWC) has described several recent state budget and policy actions intended to address the significant health and ec onomic impacts of the COVID -19 pandemic. This includes invest ments in the mental health workforce, particularly for those who work with children and youth; investments in physician residencies, with an emphasis on psychiatry; additional California Departme nt of Health Care Access and Information128 oversight for state -supported health workforce programs; expanding the scope of practice for nurse practitioners; and creating several new reimbursable provider types, such as community health workers.129 According to CFHWC key informant interviews with private sector health c are leaders, California's workforce needs include increasing workforce diversity; educating young Californians that futures in the health sector are appealing regardless of background, socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity, and gender; and partnering with s chools and companies to remove barriers to continuing education and develop pipelines for jobs.130 124 California EDD (2022), Employment Projections. 125 U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (2022), Employment Projections - 2021 -2031. 126 CHCF (2021), California 2021: A Portrait of Practice . 127 CHCF (2021), Health Workforce Strategies for California: A review of the Evidence. 128 California's Department of Health Care Access and Information was formerl y known as the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development . 129 California Future Health Workforce Commission (CFHWC) (2022), January 2022 Up date on Health Workforce Progress. 130 CFHWC (2020), Meeting the Demand for Health: Top Priorities, Challenges, and Proposed Actions for the Private S ector to Support the Workforce California Needs. Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 150 A CHCF survey of frontline health care workers during COVID -19 reflects the sustained mental and emotional toll of providing patient care during the pandemic. Six in 10 providers continue to feel overworked and burned out, while nearly half are frustrated by their job. Nearly three out of four nurses (72%) say they feel burned out from the ir work \u2014 higher than the 61% reported among nurse practitioners and phys ician assistants, 57% among doctors, and 56% among behavioral health specialists.131 Objectives Collaborate with local schools, colleges and universities to provide opportunities for students to explore and train for a variety of health care professions Disseminate best practices in clinical research findings to the health care community FY 2022 Report of Activities In FY 2022, SCHHC collaborated with local, state and national schoo ls, colleges and universities to provide hospital -based opportunities for students to explore and train for a variety of careers in health care. Although still significant, in FY 2022, student participation in these programs remained limited due to tempora ry interruptions to on - site learning, including COVID -19-related concerns. SCHHC provided training opportunities for approximately 30 nursing students and nearly 25 ancillary (non -nursing) students. Together, these students dedicated more than 10,000 hour s on the SCHHC campus. Student interns came from a variety of schools, inc luding Azusa Pacific University, Pima Medical Institute, Point Loma Nazarene University (PLNU), San Diego State University (SDSU), San Joaquin Valley College and Southwestern College . In addition, SCHHC continued to partner with Midwestern University in Gl endale, Arizona , to provide physician -led mentorship opportunities for medical students, serving five students in FY 2022. In November, SCHHC leadership provided career advice to 25 students from SDSU's School of Public Health during a professional develop ment seminar. This seminar featured a panel discussion, and students had the opportunity to ask panelists questions about launching their careers and preparing for future roles in he alth care leadership. Additionally, the Sharp Diabetes Education Program , including staff from SCHHC, provided education to several students throughout FY 2022. In September, the Sharp Diabetes Education Program provided virtual diabetes education on the different types of diab etes, diagnoses, current technology and medication , community resources for patients, patient education modalities and careers in diabetes to more than 20 dietetic students at SDSU. The Sharp Diabetes Education Program also mentored two dietetic interns fr om the San Diego Women, Infants, and Children (WIC ) Dietetic Internship program. The director of the Sharp Diabetes Education Program served as a board member of the San Diego WIC Dietetic Internship program in FY 2022 and provided a 131 CHCF (2021), COVID -19 Tracking Poll, May 2021 Views from California Health Care Providers on the Front Lines . Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 151 presentation on diabet es care, the role of the dietitian, the different types of diabetes, nutrition and meal planning, diabetes and technology and more to all six interns in the program. In September, the program director participated in a career panel discussing careers in di etetics, including outpatient diabetes care, to ap proximately 50 dietetics students at the California Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Career Fair at PLNU. During the panel's question -and-answer session, attendees were able to ask questions about panelis ts' experiences in the field of dietetics. The Pl anetree philosophy of care holds that health care should be organized first and foremost around the needs of the patient. In 2007, SCHHC became California's first Planetree designated hospital and is one of only two hospitals worldwide to have maintained t his designation for each of the past 15 years. SCHHC has also maintained Planetree Designation with Distinction Status since 2012. Further, in May, SCHHC was acknowledged at the 2022 Planetree Internationa l Conference with its fifth consecutive Gold with Distinctions award for successfully completing Planetree certification in November 2020. In May, a team of patient -centered care experts from SCHHC, including members of the hospital's Patient Family Partn ership Council, attended the 2022 Planetree Intern ational Conference in Anaheim, California to learn, share, and connect with hundreds of health experts from around the world. During a conference breakout session, SCHHC showcased the work it has done to pr omote diversity, equity and inclusion in the workp lace and in the community. Additionally, the conference displayed posters developed by SCHHC on topics such as Code Hope and COVID -19, COVID -19 monoclonal antibody infusions, ED department bridge program, a nd long -term care to demonstrate the outstanding w ork the hospital has provided in recent years. In 2017, National University 's (NU) School of Health and Human Services achieved Planetree Silver Recognition, making it the first academic institution in th e world to be recognized by Planetree. Since Septe mber 2018, SCHHC has supported NU's efforts to integrate the Planetree model of patient -centered care into its student training curriculum by providing internship opportunities for the school's nursing stud ents. As two Planetree recognized organizations, S CHHC and NU serve as a global model for other academic -practice partnerships, while exposure to a Planetree designated hospital in action helps give NU students a competitive advantage for entering the health care profession. SCHHC team members contribut ed their expertise to the broader health care community through participation in other professional conferences and events throughout the year. In March, SCHHC leadership served on the panel at the HealthLe aders Media CEOX Virtual Exchange event, where pan elists provided insights in retaining top talent to approximately 200 health care leaders. In June, SCHHC leadership also participated in the Orthopedic Trauma Conference panel discussion, where panelists d iscussed strategies to lead health care organizati ons with physicians as partners to approximately 150 physician leaders. In September, SCHHC participated in Sharp's Annual Interprofessional Research & Innovations Conference. Held virtually Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 152 in response to COVID -19, the event invited community health care professionals to participate in podium and poster presentations intended to stimulate innovation in the practice setting, identify best practices, disseminate research, encourage interprofessional collabora tion, and more. Presentations by SCHHC staff membe rs included reducing postoperative nausea and vomiting after bariatric procedures as well as implementing a medication -assisted treatment (MAT) bridge program in the ED. In FY 2022, SCHHC provided nine fr ee hospital tours, which exposed approximately 15 local and international health professionals and students to a day at a local hospital in action. Additionally in May, SCHHC hosted more than 20 Planetree International Conference attendees, who enjoyed sig nature patient experience activities, such as a hospital tour with numerous stops along the way, including an island welcome with a lei greeting, hot towel service, aromatherapy and cookie baking. Further, SCHHC contributes to the expansion of scientific knowledge and medical advancements throughout the larger health and research communities through participation in clinical trials. In FY 2022, SCHHC provided clinical trials to improve patient care and outcomes, including health care technology, pharmaceut ical treatment and prenatal tobacco reduction. FY 2023 Plan SCHHC will do the following:115 Collaborate with colleges and universities on internships, externships and other professional training opportunities for students Participate in the Health Sciences High and Middle College program to provide career pathways to ninth and 10 th grade students Collaborate with Coronado High School to provide learning experiences for students in grades 10 through 12 Participate in conferences and events to share findings f rom clinical research studies with the larger health care community Provide hospital tours and presentations to educate community health care professionals about the Planetree philosophy of patient -centered care Conduct clinical trials to improve patient care and outcomes Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 153 SCHHC Program and Service Highlights 24-hour emergency services with non -urgent online reservations available Acute and progressive care unit Advanced liver care and hepatology, and joint liver transplantation program with UC San Dieg o Health Advanced robotic -assisted procedures Metabolic and Bariatric Surger y Program Care Partner Program Classes, events and physician referral through 1 -800-82-SHARP Electroencephalograms FollowMyHealth\u00ae, a secure online patient website that gives pat ients convenient, 24-hour access to their personal health information Heart and lung services, including electrocardiogram Home health, including home infusion services132 Hospice133 Image -guided sinus surgeries using state -of-the-art 3D visualizat ion and modeling services, including multipurpose fluoroscopy room, X-ray, computed tomography (CT) scan with magnetic (MRI), cardiovascular, dual -energy x -ray hospice unit Integrat ive therapies, including acupuncture, clinical aromatherapy and massage ICU Laboratory services, including drive -thru phlebotomy, COVID -19 polymerase chain reaction testing and 10 patient service centers throughout SDC Long -term care at Villa Coronado Ski lled Nursing Facility, accredited by The Joint Commission Mindful Caf\u00e9, offering healthy and nutritious food options for patients, families, staff and community members Nutrition co unseling Orthopedics, including Radiostereometric Analysis, and robotic and total joint replacement surgeries \u2014 certified by The Joint Commission Online appointment scheduling for emergency care, mammograms, physical therapy, laboratory services, integrati ve spa therapies and fitness services Payne Family Outpatient Pavilion, including robotic surgery, an endoscopy suite with endoscopic ultrasound and a dedicated imaging and women's services suite providing 3D mammography, DEXA scanning and ultrasound Pathology services Pharmacy, including a p rescription medication disposal kiosk, immunizations, Community Pharmacy Travel Clinic, bedside prescription payment options, curbside delivery and free delivery throughout Coronado and the Cays and Imperial Beach 132 Provided through Sharp Memorial Hospital Home Health Agency. 133 Provided through Sharp HospiceCar e Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 154 Reha bilitation services, including sports medicine, and occupational, physical and speech therapies Respiratory care, providing 24 -hour services that include ventilator and high flow oxygen management, obstructive sleep apnea screening, oximetry and capnograph y monitoring, EKG, arterial blood gas testing and pulmonary function testing Sharp Coronado Hospital Auxiliary and Meals on Wheels Adopt -a-Route Senior community wellness and educational services Sewall Healthy Living Center, providing integrative spa th erapies, rehabilitation and fitness pr ograms Stroke care, nationally certified as Acute Stroke Ready by The Joint Commission Subacute services Surgical services Vision -saving laser treatment for glaucoma Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 155 Section 6 Sharp Grossmont Hospital Sharp Grossmont Hospital is proud to be a dedicated pillar of the communities we serve.

See Table 27 for a summary of unreimbursed costs based on the categories identified in Senate Bill (SB 697), and Figure 17 for the distribution of SGH's community benefit among those categories. Table 27: Economi c Value of Community Benefit Provided Sharp Grossmont Hospital \u2014 FY 2022 134 Methodology for calculating shortfalls in public programs is based on Sharp HealthCare 's (Sharp) payor-specific cost -to-charge ratios, which are derived from the cost accounting system, offset by the actual payments received. 135 Charity care and bad debt reflect the unreimbursed costs of providing services to patien ts who lack the ability to pay for ser vices at the time the services were rendered. 136 \"Vulnerable populations\" means any population that is exposed to medical or financial risk b y virtue of being uninsured, underinsured, or eligible for Medi -Cal, Medicare, California Children's Services Program, or county indigent programs. 137 Unreimbursed costs may include a n hourly rate for labor and benefits plus costs for supplies, materials a nd other purchased services. Any offsetting revenue (such as fees, grants or external donations) is deducted from the costs of providing service s. Unreimbursed costs were estimated by each department responsible for providing the program or service.

This resulted in recognition of net sup plemental revenues for SGH totaling $48. 4 million in FY 2022. This reimbursement helped offset prior years' unreimbursed medical care services; however, the additional funds recorded in FY 2022 understate the true unreimbursed medical care services perform ed for the past fiscal year. 138 The Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs (CHAMPVA) is a health benefits program in which the Department of Veterans Affairs shares the cost of certain health care services and supplies with eligible beneficiaries. TRICARE is a health care program of the U.S. Department of Defense Military Health System , which provides civilian health benefits for U.S Armed Forces military personnel, military retirees, and their dependents, including some members of the Rese rve Component.

The category also includes costs associated with Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 158 community benefit planning and administration, including community health needs assessment (CHNA) development and participation. Health Research, Education and Training Programs included time devoted to education and training for health care professionals, student and intern supervision, and time devoted to generalizable, health -related research projects that were made available to the broader health care co mmunity. Definition of Community SGH is located at 5555 Grossmont Center Drive in La Mesa, ZIP code 91942. The community served b y SGH includes the entire east region of San Diego County (SDC), including the subregional areas of Jamul, Spring Valley, L emon Grove, La Lakeside, Harbison Canyon, Crest, Alpine, Laguna -Pine Valley and Mountain Empire. In addition, much of the region includes remote, unincorporated communities. Approximately 5% of the population lives in remote or rura l areas of this region. See Appendix B for a map of community and reg ion boundaries in SDC. For SGH's 2022 CHNA process, the Dignity Health and IBM Watson Health Community Need Index (CNI) was used to identify communities with in its service area that experience greater health inequities .139,140 The CNI uses demographic and economic statistics to provide a \"CNI score\" for every populated ZIP code in the U.S. CNI scores measure inequity on a scale ranging from very low health inequit y to very high health inequity. This measurement is an average determined through an analysis of specific socioeconomic barriers to health care access, including education, income, culture/language, insurance , and housing. As such, the CNI demonstrates the link between community need, access to care and preventable hospitalizat ions. According to the CNI, communities served by SGH with especially high need include, but are not limited to, La Mesa, Lemon Grove, Spring Valley , Encanto and Mountain Empire .139 Figure 18 presents a map of the CNI findings across SDC's east region. 139 Dignity Health and IBM Watson Health Community Need Index ( CNI) (2022). The Dignity Heal th and IBM Watson CNI was discontinued on January 31, 2023. 140 According to the World Health Organization ( WHO ), health inequities are differences in health status or in the distribution of health resources between different population groups arising from t he social conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work and age. These inequities have significant social and economic costs both to individuals and societies (W HO, 2018). Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 159 Figure 18: CNI Map \u2014 SDC's East Region141 Description of Community Health In 2022 , there were 93,019 residents age s 65 and older in SDC's east region, representing 17.5% of the total regional population. Between 202 2 and 202 7, it is anticipated that the east region's senior population will grow by 13.7%.142 In 2020 , 12.1% of the east region population reported living b elow 100% of the federal poverty level (FPL), which was higher than SDC overall ( 10.9%). The unemployment rate in SDC's east region was 6.7%, which was higher than the rate for SDC overall (5.9%). In addition, 7.6% of households received Supplemental Security Income, also higher than SDC overall (5. 1%).143 141 Truven Health Analytics, 2022; Insurance Coverage Estimates, 2022; Company, 2022; and CNI, 2022. 142 SpeedTrack\u00a9, Inc.; U.S. Census Bureau. 143 The County of San Diego Healt h and Human Services Agency (HHSA), Public Health Services (PHS), Community Health Statistics Unit (CHSU) , December 2022 ; U.S. Census Bureau, 2016 -2020 American Communit y Survey 5 -year estimates. Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 160 According to the San Diego Hunger Coalition, while nutrition insecurity144 has declined since 2021, high rates remain due to long -standing economic disparities that were exacerbated by the COVID -19 pandemic . As of March 2022 , 28% of San Diegans experienced nutrition insecurity and 35% of children lived in nutrition -insecure households.145 In 2020 , 11.2% of households in the east region received Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (S NAP) benefits, while 18.5% of the popu lation lived at or below 138% FPL and were eligible for the program. These rates were higher than SDC overall (7.1% of households participated in SNAP benefits while 16.7% of households lived at or below 138% FPL).143 Please refer to Table 28 for SNAP participation and eligibility in the south region.

Please refer to Section 1 ( Overview): Patie nt Access to Care Programs for additional entity and systemwide programs designed to address access to health care. SGH provides behavioral health services to SDC's east region through clinical programs for adults and ol der adults, includ ing individuals living with psychosis, depression, grief, anxiety, traumatic stress and other behavioral health conditions . SGH also provides a dedicated psychiatric assessment team in the emergency department (ED) and acute care as well as hospital -based outpatient programs that serve individuals dealing with a variety of behavioral health issues. Beyond these clinical services, SGH lacks the resources to comprehensively meet the need for community education and support in behavioral he alth (including su bstance use). Consequently, the community education and support elements of behavioral health care are addressed through the programs and services provided through Sharp Mesa Vista Hospital and Sharp McDonald Center, which are the major p roviders of behavi oral health and substance use treatment services in SDC. Please refer to Section 11 of this report for details on those programs. SGH addresses chronic health conditions by providing education and healthy lifestyle programs as part of care for cardiovascular disease (CVD ), diabetes , obesity and other health issues influenced by healthy weight and exercise. In addition, Sharp Rees -Stealy Medical Centers clinics throughout SDC \u2014 including SDC's east region \u2014 provide structured we ight management and health education programs to community member s, such as smoking cessation and stress management , long-term support for weight management and personalized weight -loss programs. For additional details on SGH programs that specifically add ress the needs identified in the 2022 CHNA, please refer to SGH's implementation strategy . The most recent CHNA and implementation strategy Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 164 for SGH are available at http://www. sharp.com/about/community/health -needs - assessments.cfm . For each priority community need identified above, subsequent pages include a summary of the rationale and importance of the need, objective(s), FY 2022 Report of Activities conducted in support of the objective(s), and FY 202 3 Plan. Identified Community Need: Education, Support and Screening for Stroke Rationale references the findings of the SGH 2022 CHNA, HASD&IC 2022 CHNA or the health statistics unless otherwise indic ated. Rationale The HASD&IC and SGH 2022 CHNAs identified chronic conditions (including CVD and cerebrovascular diseases/stroke) as one of the priority health and social needs affecting the community members served by SGH. Participants in community engag ement activities conducted as part of the HASD&IC and SGH 2022 CHNAs identified numerous barriers to care for chronic conditions that have been exacerbated by the COVID -19 pandemic, including: fear of contracting COVID -19; social isolation; high prescripti on and insurance costs; insurance conflict s; eligibility requirements for appropriate programs; and hardships related to housing. Data analysis in Sharp's 2022 CHNAs revealed a higher volume of hospital discharges for CVD in communities facing greater so cioeconomic challenges within SDC's east region , such as El Cajon and Spring Valley .151 Participants in the interviews conducted by community health workers and promotor es as part of the HASD&IC 2022 CHNA identified heart disease and stroke as a major heal th concern among community members. Analysis of Sharp clinical data from FY 2016 to 2021 showed a 15% increase in stroke diagnoses among hospital inpatients, demonstrating the impact of patients delaying care due to the COVID -19 pandemic . In addition, the ratio of stroke deaths observed at Sharp hospitals in 2021 was 9% higher than expected when compared to 2016. Further, unpredictability during the COVID -19 pa ndemic has caused delays or disrupted access to routine and specialty care. This makes receiving comprehensive care even more challenging for people living with chronic health conditions. HASD&IC 2022 CHNA community engagement participants also identified the following hospital discharge challenges and barriers for patients, including those with chronic conditions ; low health literacy and medication adherence; lack of access to stable housing to facilitate healing and recovery; and long wait times to access the appropriate level of care. In 2020, cerebrovascular diseases (including stroke) were the fourth leading cause of death for SDC's east region, accounting for 283 deaths.149,150 151 Dignity Health and IB M Watson Health CNI (2022). Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 165 In 2019, there were 1,246 hosp italizations due to stroke in SDC's east regio n. The region's age -adjusted rate of hospitalizations for stroke was 216.6 per 100,000 population \u2014 the second highest among all SDC regions.152 In 2019, there were 522 stroke -related ED visits in SDC's east region. The age - adjusted rate of ED visits was 90. 7 per 100,000 population \u2014 the highest among all SDC regions. According to 2021 CHIS data, 32.5% of residents in SDC's east region had ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure, while 4.0% had borderline high blood pressure. In addition, 30.2% of east r egion adults reported being obese \u2014 higher than the county overall ( 21.7%).148 According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), more than 795,000 people in the U.S. have a stroke each year, an d strokes are responsible for approximately 1 out of every 6 deaths from CVD .153 The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke reports that 25% of people who recover from their first stroke will have another stroke within five years .154 The CDC estimates that up to 80% of strokes are preventable through the recognition of early signs/symptoms and the elimination of stroke r isk factors. Behaviors that can mitigate the risk of stroke include choosing a healthy diet full of fruits and vegetables, m aintaining a healthy weight, engaging in at least 2.5 hours of moderate -intensity aerobic physical activity each week, refraining fr om or quitting smoking and limiting alcohol intake .155 Despite encouraging data about declining stroke incidence, on a global level the aging population and accumulating risk factors contribute to an increasing lifetime risk of stroke .156 Objective Provide stroke education, support and screening services for the east region of SDC FY 202 2 Report of Activities In August 2022 , The Joint Commission and American Heart Association (AHA )/American Stroke Association (ASA) re-certified SGH's Stroke Center as a Comprehensive Stroke Center, the highest designation for stroke care. The program quickly and effectively treats all types of stroke , including the most complex cases, and is national ly recognized for its outreach, education and thorough screening procedures, as well as documentation of its success rate. SGH is a recipient of the AHA/ASA's Get With The Guidelines\u00ae (GWTG) \u2014 Stroke Silver Plus Quality Achievement Award for excellence in stroke care, as well as the Target: Stroke Elite Honor Roll designation. The AHA/ASA's GWTG is a national effort focused on ensuring the use of evidence - based therapies to improve outcomes for stroke patients. The AHA/ASA's Target: 152 County of San Diego HHSA, PHS, CHSU (2021); U.S. Census Bureau, 201 5-2019 American Community Survey 5 -year estimates. 153 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) (2022), Stroke F acts. 154 National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (2022), Stroke. 155 CDC (2022), Men and Stroke. 156 American Heart Association ( AHA) (2022), U.S. stroke rate declining in adults 75 and older , yet rising in adults 49 and younger . Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 166 Stroke Elite Honor Roll designation focuses on improving the timeliness of intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV t -PA) administration to eligible patients. In addition, the SGH Rehabilitation Center is accredited by CARF (Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facil ities) for its stroke specialty program, which represents the highest level of accreditation that can be awarded to an organization. As the COVID -19 pandemic persisted through FY 2022, Sharp's syste mwide stroke program and SGH's Stroke Center brought virtual stroke education to the community. In partnership with Sharp's marketing team, the systemwide stroke program shared information about stroke and atrial fibrillation through Sharp's social media channels and more . Building off its successful implementation in FY 2021, this virtual community education had an expansive reach, connecting with more than 17,000 individuals in FY 2022. In addition, in FY 202 2 the program displayed billboards to educate c ommunity members about stroke recognition, in cluding BEFAST (balance, eyes, face, arm, speech, time) and conditions that can lead to stroke. In FY 2022 , in-person stroke education in the community resumed, with increased involvement by Sharp's systemwide stroke program staff in health fairs and com munity events focused on heart and brain health. In July, SGH's Stroke Center participated in the Silayan Filipina's Heart Smart Series: Stroke and Heart Attack Awareness event. Hosted at the Mission Valley Libr ary, SGH staff provided approximately 80 atte ndees with stroke education, flyers on BEFAST, and blood pressure screenings, as well as answered questions. In FY 2022, SGH's Stroke Center and the Progressive Care Unit for Acute Stroke participated in the Sha rp Women's Health Conference where they provi ded attendees with stroke education , screening of personal risk factors , risk modification strategies , and information about the signs and symptoms of stroke . SGH also provided conference attendees with blood pr essure and pulse checks. SGH continued its 1 7-year collaboration with the County of San Diego Emergency Medical Services (EMS) to provide data for the SDC stroke registry, where data is tracked to identify gaps and determine trends. SGH also continued to actively participate in the qu arterly San Diego County Stroke Consortium, a collaborative effort with other SDC hospitals to improve stroke care and discuss issues impacting stroke care in SDC. The San Diego County Stroke Consortium consists of 18 hospita ls \u2014 including SGH, Sharp Corona do Hospital and Healthcare Center , Sharp Chula Vista Medical Center , Sharp Memorial Hospital , Alvarado Hospital Medical Center, Kaiser San Diego Medical Center, Kaiser Zion Medical Center, Palomar Medical Center, Paradise Val ley Hospital, Scripps Memorial Hospital Encinitas, Scripps Memorial Hospital La Jolla, Scripps Mercy Hospital Chula Vista, Scripps Mercy Hospital San Diego, Temecula Valley Hospital, Tri -City Medical Center, University of California ( UC) San Diego Medical Center, and UC San Diego Medica l Center - La Jolla \u2014 all of which are San Diego County Stroke Receiving Centers and certified by the Joint Commission. In response to the COVID -19 pandemic, meetings continued to be held virtually in FY 2022. Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 167 Sharp's syste mwide stroke program continued to partner with the San Diego County Stroke Consortium to develop educational materials, including training videos, for AMR (American Medical Response) San Diego, a medical transportation company that assists with emergency a nd non -emergency transportation . In November, this included a video addressing the topics of new stroke procedures and guidelines, and how to assess a stroke patient at the scene. Further, Sharp's systemwide stroke program continues to participate in the d evelopment of EMS protocol updates. Sharp's systemwide stroke program also collaborated wi th San Diego County Stroke Consortium hospitals in FY 2022 to help alleviate community concerns related to obtaining health care during the COVID -19 pandemic. Using social media, the hospitals released a message encouraging San Diegans not to delay seeking care during the pandemic. Each message sent from Sharp reached 16,000 subscribers on Facebook, Instagram and other Sharp -associated social media outlets. FY 202 3 Plan SGH Stroke Center will do the following :157 Provide stroke education, screening and o utreach to community members in the east region via social media and in -person classes Provide education for individuals with identified stroke risk factors Provide stroke education and screenings at the Sharp Women's Health Conference Offer a stroke suppo rt group in conjunction with the hospital's Outpatient Rehabilitation Department Participate in the San Diego County Stroke Consortium Participate in annual EMS educ ation, with a focus on Large Vessel Occlusion, or blockages of the proximal intracranial anterior and posterior circulation , identification in the field Provide data to the SDC stroke registry Provide a community presentation on stroke education and preven tion featuring a Sharp -affiliated physician Identified Community Need: Heart and Vascular Disease Education and Screening Rationale references the findings of the SGH 2022 CHNA, HASD&IC 2022 CHNA or the most recent SDC community health statistics unless otherwise indicated. Rationale The HASD&IC and SGH 2022 CHNAs identified chronic health conditions, including CVD, as one of the priority health and social needs affecting the community members served by SGH. 157 Where app licable, the Sharp Grossmont Hospital ( SGH ) Stroke Center will perform these activities as COVID -19 public health and safety guidelines allow. Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 168 Data analysis in the SGH 2022 CHNA revealed a higher volume of hospital discharges due to CVD in communities facing greater socioeconomic challenges within SDC's east region, s uch as El Cajon and Spring Valley.158 Participants in the interviews conducted by community health workers and promotor es as part of the HASD&IC 2022 CHNA identified high blood pressure and heart disease and stroke as a major health concern among community members. HASD&IC community engagement participants identified numerous barriers to care for chronic conditions that have been exacerbated by the COVID -19 pandemic, including: fear of contracting COVID -19; social isolation; high prescription and insurance costs; insurance conflicts ; eligibility requirements for appropriate programs; and hardships related to housing . Further, unp redictability during the COVID -19 pandemic has ca used delays or disrupted access to routine and specialty care. This makes receiving comprehensive care even more challenging for people living with chronic health conditions. HASD&IC 2022 CHNA community enga gement participants also identified the following hospital discharge challenges and barriers for patients, including those with chronic conditions ; low health literacy and medication adherence ; lack of access to stable housing to facilitate healing and rec overy ; and long wait times to access the appropri ate level of care . Analysis of Sharp clinical data from FY 2016 to 2021 showed a 16% increase in acute myocardial infarction diagnoses among hospital inpatients, but a 10% decrease in heart failure diagnose s among hospital inpatients. In addition, the rat io of acute myocardial infarction deaths observed at Sharp hospitals in 2021 was 21% lower than expected when compared to 2016, while the ratio of heart failure deaths was 9% lower. In addition, according t o Sharp hospital data , 61.5% of COVID -19 inpatients admitted from March 2020 to March 2022 presented with hypertension, and individuals with hypertension were 2.5 times more likely to be admitted to the hospital than non -hypertensive COVID -19 patients. In addition, COVID -19 patients with hypertension were 42% more likely to require a stay in the intensive care unit (ICU). According to hospital data presented in the SGH 2022 CHNA, nearly all (89.8%) of seniors admitted to SGH in 2020 had a disease of the ci rculatory system, with nearly half (48.8%) diagnosed with essential hypertension and 35.9% with coronary atherosclerosis or another heart disease. In 2020, heart disease was the leading cause of death in SDC's east region.149,150 In 2020 , there were 904 deaths due to diseases of the heart in SDC's east region. The region's age -adjusted death rate due to heart disease was 147.9 per 100,000 population. This was higher than the age -adjusted death rate for SDC overall ( 122.5 deaths per 100,000 population). In 201 9, there were 1,116 hospitalizations for coronary heart disease ( CHD ) in SDC's east region. The age -adjusted rate of hospitalization for CHD was 191.8 per 100,00 0 population, which is higher than the age -adjusted rate for SDC overall (166.8 per 100,000 population).152 158 Dignity Health and IBM Watson Health CNI (2022). Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 169 In 201 9, there were 255 ED visits for CHD in SDC's east region. The age -adjusted rate of ED visits was 45.0 per 100,000 population, higher than the age -adjusted rate for SDC overall ( 37.2 per 100,000 population). According to 2021 CHIS data, 8.5% of adults living in SDC's east region indicated that they were ever diagnosed with heart disease, higher than S DC overall ( 6.7%).148 Data from the 2021 CHIS indicated that 32.5% of adults living in SDC's east region had ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure, higher tha n SDC overall ( 26.1%) and the state of Califo rnia (26.8%) .148 According to the CDC, heart disease (including CHD, hypertension and stroke) is the leading cause of death for both men and women, and kills approximately 697,000 people each year .159 Heart disea se is the leading cause of death for people of most racial/ethnic groups in the U.S. , including Black , American Indian, Alaska Native, Hispanic and white men. For women from the Pacific Islands , and Asian American, American Indian, Alaska Native, and Hispa nic women, heart disease is second only to cancer .159 In its 2022 Heart Disease and Stroke Statistical Update , the AHA reported that CHD was responsible for 12.6% of all deaths in the U.S. in 2019 , killing near ly 36 1,000 people. Death rates and ac tual numbers of deaths from CHD decreased significantly between 2009 and 2019 , but disease burden and risk factors remain high. According to blood pressure guidelines championed by the AHA and the American College of Cardiology, 47.3% of U.S. adults have h ypertension .160 According to the AHA, it may be possible to prevent heart disease, stroke and CVD by not smoking, engaging in daily physical activity, getting adequate sleep, maintaining a healthy diet and body weight an d controlling cholesterol, blood pressure and blood sugar .160 The CDC asserts that several health co nditions, along with lifestyle, age and family history , are risk factors that can increase an individual's ri sk for heart disease. About half of all Americans (47%) have at least one of three key risk factors for heart disease: high blood pressure, high ch olesterol and smoking .161 Objectives Provide heart and vascular education and screening services for the comm unity, with an emphasis on adults, women and seniors Share expertise in cardiovascular care with community health care professionals through participation in professional conferences a nd collaboratives Participate in programs to improve the care and outcom es of individuals with heart and vascular disease 159 CDC (2022), Heart Disease Facts .

Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 170 FY 202 2 Report of Activities In FY 202 2, SGH's congestive heart failure (CHF) nurse specialist and the Cardiac Rehabilitation Department provided education and support to patients and community members impacted by CHF. Due to the COVID -19 pandemic, educational programs were offered virtually in FY 2022 . SGH's free, virtual CHF class and support group was offered monthly and provided an average of five to 10 individuals per session with a supportive envi ronment to discuss various topics about living well with CHF. The SGH Cardiac Rehabilitation D epartment also shared a series of videos on exercis e and CHF to educate community members with CHF and their loved ones. During National Heart Month in February, an exercise physiologist from the Cardiac Rehabilitation Department provided a virtual educat ion class for seniors in collaboration with the SGH Senior Resource Center. Approximately 30 seniors received education on maintaining a healthy heart through exe rcise , steps one can take to start an exercise program, the benefits of exercise and exercise precautions . In March and May, a Sharp -affiliated cardiac electrophysiologist hosted a webinar titled Advanced Treatment Options for Atrial Fibrillation, which e ducated 50 attendees about the symptoms, diagnosis and surgical and non -surgical treatment opt ions for individuals living with atrial fibrillation. In May, a Sharp -affiliated interventional cardiologist offered a webinar titled Advances in Heart Valve Trea tment: Mitral Valve Regurgitation, educating nearly 30 attendees about mitral valve regurgitat ion symptoms, diagnosis and treatment. A Sharp -affiliated interventional cardiologist shared aortic heart valve disease information and advanced treatments to nea rly 10 attendees during a webinar in August. SGH's Cardiovascular Services and Cardiac Rehab ilitation Department traditionally participate in a variety of community events throughout the year ; however , due to the COVID -19 pandemic, these events were limited. SGH's Cardiovascular Services and Cardiac Rehabilitation Department participated in the Sharp Women's Health Conference . During the event, SGH's cardiac team provided cardiac education and resources as well as information about hospital services. In FY 2022, Sharp, including SGH, partnered with the AHA's signature women's movement, Go Red for Women, to help raise awareness and improve the lives of women by empowering them to take charge of their heart health. SGH shared heart - health information thr ough its Facebook page throughout the year. SGH also participated in the Go Red for Women Lunc heon in February at the US Grant San Diego hotel , where two registered nurses (RN) from SGH's Cardiovascular Services and Cardiac Rehabilitation Department provid ed free blood screenings and shared heart health -related resources, and a Sharp -affiliated car diologist presented on heart health. Nearly 400 community members attended the luncheon, which is committed to ending heart disease in women and raising awareness of the health conditions associated with Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 171 it. Further, SGH, including the Cardiac Rehabilitati on Department , participated in and provided funding for AHA's San Diego Heart & Stroke Walk. In October and April , SGH participated in the 1 9th and 20th semiann ual meetings of Southern California VOICe (Vascular Outcomes Improvement Collaborative), which included more than 30 regional vascular physicians, nurses, epidemiologists, scientists and research personnel at each event working together to collect and anal yze vascular data in an effort to improve patient care. SGH shared its expertise on patient ca re, the use of data processes to improve outcomes and compliance with clinical standards. The meetings were held virtually and at the Coronado Island Marriott Res ort & Spa. SGH continued to participate in programs to improve the care and outcomes of individuals with heart and vascular disease. To assist acutely ill patients in SDC, SGH provided data on STEMI (ST -elevation myocardial infarction or acute heart att ack) to the County of San Diego EMS and participated in the quarterly County of San Diego Cardiac Advisory Committee for STEMI. In response to the COVID -19 pandemic, committee meetings remained virtual in FY 202 2. Throughout FY 202 2, Sharp -affiliated ca rdiologists , a Sharp -affiliated cardiothoracic surgeon and staff from SGH's Car diac Training Center and Cardiac Rehabilitation Department shared heart -related information with sharp.com as well as local news outlets, including KUSI News , CBS News 8 - San D iego and 10News - ABC San Diego KGTV . Topics included new U.S. Preventive Servi ces Task Force guidelines on aspirin and heart attacks; a patient's path through a widowmaker heart attack, where blood stops flowing to the heart until a surgeon can insert a stent that allows blood to flow; Go Red for Women\u00ae and National Wear Red Day in February \u2014 raising awareness for heart disease and stroke; the Go Red for Women Luncheon ; differences in heart disease symptoms between men and women, heart disease risk factors and what to ask one's doctor about keeping the heart healthy. FY 202 3 Plan SGH will do the following :162 Provide a monthly CHF class and support group Provide a virtual cardiac health lecture for senior community members Offer health care professionals lectures from educational speakers on performance improvements in CHF and acu te myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular treatment options Provide data on STEMI to the County of San Diego EMS and participate in the County of San Diego Cardiac Advisory Com mittee 162 Where applicable, SGH will perform these activities as COVID -19 public health and safety guidelines allow Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 172 Identified Community Need: Diabetes Education, Prevention and Support Rationale references the findings of the SGH 2022 CHNA, HASD&IC 2022 CHNA or the most recent SDC community health statistics unless otherwise indicated. Rationale The HASD&IC and SGH 2022 CHNAs identified chronic conditions, including diabetes, as one of the priority health needs affecting the community members served by SGH . Data analysis in the SGH 2022 CHNA revealed a higher volume of hospital discharges due to Type 2 diabe tes in commu nities within SDC's east region facing greater socioeconomic challenges, such as El Cajon and Spring Valley .158 Participants in the interviews conducted by community health workers and promotor es as part of the HASD&IC 20 22 CHNA identified diabetes as a major health concern among community members. HASD&IC community engagement participants identified l ack of access to utilities and household appliances as a challenge to diabetes management due to the importance of proper medication storage and preparation of nutritious meals. An analysis of Sharp clinical data from FY 2016 to 2021 showed a 35% increase in diabetes diagnoses among hospital inpatients, demonstrating the impact of patients delaying care due to the COVID -19 pandemic. In addition, the ratio of diabetes deaths observed at Sharp hospitals in 2021 was 89% higher than expected when compared to 2016. Furthermore, more than half (58.3%) of SGH inpatients with a diabetes diagnosis in 2020 were sen iors. In addition, according to Sharp hospital data , 40% of COVID -19 inpatients admitted from March 2020 to March 2022 presented with diabetes , and individuals with diabetes were 2.1 times more likely to be admitted to the hospital than non -diabetic COVID -19 patients. In addition, COVID -19 patients with diabetes were 82% more likely to require a stay in the ICU. In 2020 , diabetes was the eighth leading cause of death in SDC's east region.149,150 In 201 9, there were 159 deaths due to diabetes in SDC's east region. The region's age-adjusted death rate due to diabetes was 27.7 per 100,000 population, higher than the overall SDC age -adjusted rate (20. 6 deaths per 100,00 0 population).152 In 201 9, there were 1,061 hospitalizations due to diabetes in SDC's east region. The age-adjusted rate of hospitalizations for diabetes was 200.8 per 100,000 population. This rate wa s the hig hest among all SDC regions and higher than the age -adjusted rate of hospitalization for SDC overall ( 137.2 per 100,000 population). In 201 9, there were 1, 100 diabetes -related ED visits in SDC's east region. The age - adjusted rate of diabetes -relate d ED visi ts was 211.6 per 100,000 population. This was the third highest rate among all SDC regions and was higher than the age - adjusted rate for SDC overall ( 169.1 per 100,000 population). According to 2021 CHIS data, 12.9% of adults living in SDC's east region in dicated that they had ever been diagnosed with diabetes, which was slightly higher than SDC overall ( 8.5%) and the state of California ( 10.8%). Diabetes rates among Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 173 seniors were particularly high, with 21.1% of east region adults ages 65 and older reportin g that they had ever been diagnosed with diabetes.148 According to 2021 CHIS data, 22.9% of residents in the east region had been told by their doctor that they have pre - or borderline diabetes, slightly higher than residents in SDC overall ( 16.6%).148 According to a repo rt from the American Diabetes Association (ADA) titled The Burden of Diabetes in California, approximately 10.5% of adults in California are diagnos ed with diabetes. In addition, 33.4% of adults have prediabetes.163 Data presented by the CDC indicates that, in 2021, diabetes prevalence in California was highest among non -Hispanic Black individuals (17.5%), followed by Hispanic individuals (13.3.%), non -Hispanic Asian individuals (11.5%), and non -Hispanic White individuals (9.2%).164 According t o the CDC, diabetes is the seventh leading cause of death in the U.S. In addition, the number of adults diagnosed with diabetes in the U.S. has more than doubled in the last 20 years as the U.S. population has aged and become more overweight .165 The CDC's 2 022 National Diabetes Statistics Report indicates that 89.8% of adults diagnosed with diabetes from 2015 to 2018 were overweight or obese, and 69.0% had high blood pr essure. Factors that may reduce the risk of diabetes complications include having a usual source for diabetes care; meeting recommended physical activity goals; managing or losing weight; managing A1C levels, blood pressure and cholesterol; and quitting sm oking .166 The CDC estimates that 37.3 million people in the U.S. had diabetes in 2019. Of those individuals, 23% met laboratory criteria for diabetes but were not aware they had the disease.166 According to the CDC, diabetes i ncreases the risk of heart disease and stroke and can lead to other serious complications, such as kidney failure, blindness and amputation of a toe, foot, or leg. People with diabetes spend more on health care, have fewer productive years and miss more wo rkdays compared to people who do not have diabetes .167 Objectives Provide diabetes education, prevention and support in the east region of SDC Collaborate with community organizations and projects to provide diabetes education to community members with barriers to health equity Participate in local and national conferences to share best practices in diabetes treatment and control with the broader health care community 163 American Diabetes Association (2021), The Burden of Diabetes in California. 164 CDC (2022), Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, 2021 . 165 CDC (2022), Diabetes Fast Facts . 166 CDC (2022), National Diabetes Statistics Report . 167 CDC National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Pr omotion (2022), Diabetes and Prediabetes . Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 174 FY 202 2 Report of Activities The SGH Diabetes Education Program is re cognized by the ADA for meeting national standards for excellence and quality in diabetes education , including blood sugar monitoring, medication and nutritional counseling as well as insulin pump and other device training. The program is led by certified diabetes care and education specialists, who provide individuals and their support systems with the skills nee ded to successfully manage various conditions, including prediabetes, gestational diabetes (diabetes developed during pregnancy), as well as Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. In FY 202 2, small group and one -on-one education options were offered in -person or onli ne, in both English and Spanish. In FY 20 22, the Sharp Diabetes Education Program offered diabetes education and support to approximately 650 attendees at the Sharp Women's Health Conference. This included diabetes risk assessments using the ADA's Diabetes Risk Test questionnaire as well as resources on topics including the different types of diabetes; diabetes prevention; signs, symptoms and c ompl ications of diabetes; the connection between diabetes and CVD; nutrition and reading food labels; exercise; medication; and diabetes self-management. A Sharp diabetes expert also provided education on the prevention and management of Type 2 diabetes, i ncluding helpful diets, physical activity and the power of lifestyle change . In January, the Sharp Diabetes Education Program provided a presentation about diabetes and making healthy food choices to seven community members at the Herrick Community Healt h Library. At the San Diego Crew Classic rowing event in March, a Sharp Diabetes Education Program nurse provided first aid in the Sharp medical tent and answered health -related questions for approximately 200 attendees . In addition, t he Sharp Diabetes Edu cation Program provided fundraising and team participation for the 2022 San Diego Heart & Stroke Walk in September. Although the Sharp Diabetes Education Program had anticipated participating in additional community events, conferences and educational pres entations throughout FY 202 2, many in-person activities were canceled or postponed due to the COVID -19 pandemic. The Sharp Diabetes Education Program is an affiliate of the California Diabetes and Pregnancy Program's Sweet Success Program, which provides comp rehensive technical support and education to medical personnel and community liaisons to promote improved outcomes for high -risk pregnant women with diabetes. As an affiliate, the Sharp Diabetes Education Program teaches underserved pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers with Type 1, Type 2 or gestational diabetes how to manage their blood sugar levels. In FY 2022 , the program collaborated with community clinics , including Family Health Centers of San Diego (FHCSD ), La Maestra, San Ysidro Health, Neig hborhood Healthcare, Borrego Health and San Diego Family Care to provide patients with education and resources to support a healthy pregnancy. Since the onset of the pandemic, the program has accommodated individual preferences by serving patients with vir tual, telephone and on -site options. Topics included gestational Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 175 diabetes statistics ; new diagnostic criteria ; treatment and management of blood glucose levels ; goals for blood sugar levels before and after a meal; insulin requirements ; self- care practices ; nutrition and meal planning ; exercise and weight management ; monitoring fetal movement ; and the risks and complications of uncontrolled diabetes. Clinic patients also received logbooks to track and manage their blood sugar levels. In addition, the Sharp Diab etes Education Program evaluated patients' management of their blood sugar levels and collaborated with community clinics' obstetrician /gynecologists (OB-GYN) to prevent complications . At SGH in FY 2022 , the Sharp Diabetes Education Program provided servic es and education to more than 1,000 underserved pregnant and breastfeeding women with diabetes. Throughout the year, the Sharp Diabetes Education Program continued to provide services and resources to meet the needs of culturally diverse populations with in SDC. For the east region, this included particular attention to the needs of new I raqi Chaldean immigrants . Educational resources included How to Live Healthy With Diabetes , What You Need to Know About Diabetes , All About Blood Glucose for People With T ype 2 Diabetes , All About Carbohydrate Counting , Getting the Very Best Care for Your Diabetes , All About Insulin Resistance , All About Physical Activity With Diabetes , Gestational Diabetes Mellitus Seven -Day Menu Plan , Food Groups , and Arabic language mate rials about pregnancy. Resources were provided in Arabic, Somali, Tagalog, Vietnamese and Spanish, and food diaries and logbooks were distributed for community members to track their blood sugar levels. Live interpreter services were available in more than 200 languages via the Stratus Video Interpreting iPad application, and the program f acilitated translation and other resources specifically addressing Chaldean cultural needs. Further, Sharp's certified diabetes care and education specialists received tra ining from the Sharp Equality Alliance to improve the delivery of inclusive and cultu rally competent care for diverse communities. In FY 2022, SGH continued to use post -discharge phone calls to help prevent hospital readmissions among patients identified t o be at high -risk. Through this effort, post -discharge calls were provided to 15 comm unity members in their preferred language to review next steps, including following up with a primary care physician (PCP) and discussing the plan of care. In November, the Sharp Diabetes Education Program hosted a diabetes conference for physicians, nur ses, pharmacists, laboratorians, clinical and managerial leaders and other community health professionals interested in optimizing inpatient diabetes care. The conference provided approximately 150 participants with specific tools and strategies for creating a hospital culture that supports and encourages emerging therapeutic trends in glycemic management. Topics included COVID -19 and how it highlights diabetes concerns ; the use of certain medicatio ns and continuous glucose monitoring in the inpatient setting; the effect of nutrition on glycemic management ; the importance of g lycemic targets ; and d iabetes from a behavioral perspective . In FY 202 2, the Sharp Diabetes Educati on Program continued to se rve as an insulin pump training center to support endocrinologists and PCP groups throughout SDC. Through this effort, the program trains community providers to use diabetes technology, including insulin pumps and blood glucose mo nitors, to improve patient care and Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 176 outcomes. Further, the Sharp Diabetes Education Program recently implemented an enhanced electronic medical record system to improve care coordination with more than 300 community endocrinologists and PCP groups. FY 2023 Plan The SGH and Sharp Diabetes Education Programs will do the following :168 Provide prediabetes and diabetes information to community members at various community venues in SDC's east region, as well as through virtual platforms Offer a webinar series on the role of nutri tion in preparation for pregnancy, including information about diabetes Explore collaborations to assist and educate community members experiencing food insecurity Explore collaboration with community organizations to provide diabetes ed ucation for communi ty members, including seniors and caregivers Explore future collaborations with community clinics to provide education and resources to their patients with diabetes Provide gestational diabetes services and resources to underserved pregn ant and breastfeeding women, both at SGH and community clinics Participate in Tour de Cure \u2014 the ADA's signature fundraising event to fight diabetes \u2014 as well as the San Diego Heart & Stroke Walk Maintain up -to-date resources about diabetes treatment and p reventio n to support community members with diabetes, particularly foreign language and culturally appropriate resources for diverse populations Participate in local and national conferences to share best practices in diabetes treatment and control with th e broade r health care community Conduct educational symposiums for health care professionals focused on improving outpatient and inpatient diabetes care Host a diabetes conference for health care professionals Explore collaborations with community organiz ations t hat focus on diabetes prevention and care Partner with community physicians to help them improve patient outcomes using technology, including insulin pumps and blood glucose monitors Participate in 2 -1-1's Community Information Exchange (CIE) pro gram to serve patients with barriers to health equity by connecting them to community services Offer free outpatient phone visits for patients recently discharged from SGH who are uninsured, newly diagnosed with diabetes and in need of additional assistanc e to prevent readmission during the COVID -19 pandemic 168 Where applicable, the SGH and Sharp Diabetes Education Program will perform these activities as COVID -19 public health and safety guidelines allow. Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 177 Identified Community Need: Health Education, Screening , Support and Resources for Aging Care & Support Rationale references the findings of the SGH 2022 CHNA, HASD&IC 2022 CHNA or the most recent SD C community health statistics unless otherwise indicated. Rationale The HASD&IC and SGH 2022 CHNAs identified issues that affect care and support during the aging process as a high priority health need affecting members of the communities served by SGH. Within this need, the following themes were identified: economic stabi lity and risk of homelessness; social isolation; access to health care; access to community resources and support; behavioral health; stigma; and other health and safety concerns. A primary theme across HASD&IC's community engagement activities was economic instability among seniors. Financial stability was identified as a significant barrier to aging at home with dignity , and seniors may experience health impacts related to the unafford ability of necess ary home modifications or equipment. HASD&IC s econdary data identified several factors that contribute to poverty among seniors : limited income , chronic health conditions , disability , and the loss of a significant other. L ow-income seniors may be depend ent on public programs like Medi -Cal and cash assistance (Supplemental Security Income) to make ends meet. The Institute for Public Health's ( IPH) Sharp Provider Survey conducted as part of the SGH 2022 CHNA identified increased isolation am ong seniors as one of the top clinical and social needs most seriously impacted by COVID -19 in the past year. Sharp Insight Community Survey respondents ages 65 and older reported experiencing a decrease in access to social support , healthy food, transpor tation and community resources as a result of COVID -19. Participants identified caregivers of adults or older adults as the leading population impacted by COVID in relation to increase d isolation in seniors/older adults, increased anxiety and depression, and decreased access to behavioral health care. Survey participants suggested the following strategies to address increased isolation among seniors/older adults : finding ways to allow v isitation during COVID -19; establishing or expanding home visiting and o ther follow -up services; expanding or resuming services for seniors ; offering more patient education and referrals; improving access to technology; and providing support for caregivers . According to hospital data presented in the SGH 2022 CHNA, seniors re presented 37.5% of all inpatient discharges and 16.3% of ED encounters at SGH in 2020. In addition, seniors represented 48.4% of inpatient discharges for unintentional injury at SGH, with fall -related injuries occurring in 38.4% of those discharges. Senio rs also represented 72.4% of inpatient discharges with an osteoarthritis diagnosis. Data analysis also found that over a third (37.9%) of seniors admitted to SGH had a behavioral healt h diagnosis, with 35.2% diagnosed with a depressive disorder and 26.9% w ith an anxiety and fear -related disorder. In 2020 , Alzheimer's disease was the sixth leading cause of death in SDC's east region for all age groups.149,150 Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 178 In 20 19, the top 10 leading causes of death among adults age s 65 and older in SDC's east region were (in rank order): diseases of the heart, cancer, cerebrovascular diseases (including stro ke), chronic lower respiratory diseases, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, accidents/unintentional injuries , essential hypertension and hypertensive renal disease , Parkinson's disease and flu/pneumonia. In 201 9, hospitalization rates among seniors in SDC's ea st region were higher than the east region's general population for all major causes, including cancer , hypertensive diseases, diseases of the heart , osteoarthritis, unintentional injuries, falls, stroke, diabetes and flu/pneumonia .152 The top three causes of ED utilization among S DC's east region residents age s 65 and older in 201 9 were falls, unintentional injuries and overall heart disease. In 2021, the top five needs fo r 2-1-1 clients age s 60 and older were (in rank order): housing, utilities, income support and employment, cons umer services, and health care.169 The CDC reports that three million older adults are treated in the ED for falls every year. One in five falls causes a serious injury, such as broken bones or a head injury, and each fall doubles the chance of falling agai n. Fall injuries may result in serious mobility issues and difficulty with everyday tasks or living independently.170 Between 2015 and 2030, the number of east region residents living with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias is projected to increase by 27.4% .171 According to the California Department of Aging, 11.0% of SDC residents age s 60 and older were low -income in 2021 , and 18.1% we re eligible for Medi -Cal. In addition, 17.1% of SDC seniors were identified as living alone .172 The Caregiving in the U .S. 2020 report estimates that 16.8% (41.8 million) of Americans care for an adult age 50 and older, an increase from 14.3% in 2015. Caregiving prevalence has increased among all racial/ethnic groups, educational levels, work statuses, genders and nearly a ll generations .173 The 2022 National Strategy to Support Family Caregivers report proposes five main goals to support family caregive rs: increase awareness and outreach; build partnerships and engagement with family caregivers; strengthen services and suppo rts; ensure financial and workplace security; and expand data, research, and evidence -based practices related to family caregiving.174 According to a report titled Burning the Candle at Both Ends: Sandwich Generation Caregiving in the U.S. , sandwich caregiv ers \u2014 those who provide unpaid care to an adult while also caring for children in their home \u2014 account for 28% of all caregivers . Sandwich caregivers often juggle work and caregiving responsibilities, and report high levels of emotional stress and physical or financial strain.175 Research published in Health Affairs indicates that lack of access to technology, low digital health litera cy and design barriers in patient portals and apps have 169 2-1-1 San Diego (2022), Data Dashboard . 170 CDC (2021), Facts About Falls . 171 County of San Diego HHSA, PHS, CHSU (2018), Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias in San Diego County . 172 California Department of Aging (CDA) (2022), CDA Population Demographic Projections for Intrastate Funding Formula . 173 National Alliance for Caregiving (NAC) (2020), Caregiving in the U.S. 2020 . 174 NAC (2022), 2022 National Strategy to Support Family Caregivers . 175 NAC (2019), Burning the Candle at Both Ends: Sandwich Generation Car egiving in the U.S . Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 179 disproportionately affected older adults during the COVID -19 pandemic, especially those in underserved communities .176 Objectives Provide senior -focused health education , resources, screening s and community outreach programs Produce and mail quarterly activity calendars to community members Provide daily telephone reassuran ce and safety check calls to isolated or homebound seniors and adults with disabilities in SDC's east region Serve as a resource for referral s to additional community support services for senior s in SDC's east region Provide education and community resourc es to caregivers Maintain and grow partnerships with community organizations to expand community outreach and p rovide both seniors and caregivers with updated information on available services and resources FY 202 2 Report of Activities The Sharp Senior R esource Centers meet the unique needs of seniors and their caregivers by connecting them to a variety of free and low -cost programs and services through email, phone and in -person consultations. The Sharp Senior Resource Centers' compassi onate staff and vo lunteers provide personalized support as well as clear, accurate information regarding health education and screenings, community referrals and caregiver resources. In FY 2022, the SGH Senior Resource Center developed and mailed activity calendars describi ng its programs and services to more than 6,700 households in SDC's east region. In addition, the SGH Senior Resource Center distributed nearly 2,800 Vials of Life \u2014 small vinyl sleeves that can be magnetically affixed onto a refrigerator to provide emerge ncy personnel with critical medical information for seniors and people with disabilities. Vials of Life were also distributed to cardiac, diabetic and stroke patients at the hospital during the COVID -19 pandemic. In addition, the SGH Seni or Resource Center collaborated with Meals on Wheels San Diego County to provide Vials of Life to every new member of the program in East County. In total , the SGH Senior Resource Center reached over 13,000 individuals through its community programs in FY 2022 . The SGH Se nior Resource Center provides Sharp Grossmont Checks In, a telephone reassurance and safety check program for isolated or homebound seniors and community members with disabilities living in SDC's east region. Through the program, SGH Seni or Resource Center staff and volunteers place computerized phone calls to participants daily at regularly scheduled times. If staff members do not connect with participants, a phone call is placed to family members or friends to ensure their safety. Since FY 2021, the progr am has also provided participants with medication reminders . Throughout the year, staff placed nearly 4,200 phone calls. 176 Fulmer, T., Reuben, D.

In March, SGH sponsored and participated in the Spring Into Healthy Living event at the McGrath Famil y YMCA in Rancho San Diego. The event featured 40 different exhibitors and presentations on various health and wellness topics such as nutrition and mental health aw areness, and offered health screenings including balance, BMI, hearing and stroke. During t he event, the SGH Senior Resource Center provided senior -focused resources and Vials of Life to more than 70 attendees. In May, the SGH Senior Resource Center also offered senior resources at the Sharp Women's Health Conference , where there were 650 attend ees. In honor of National Healthcare Decisions Day in April, Sharp's ACP department partnered with GHD to host a community presentation titled Health Care Decision Making 2022: Planting Now for the Journey Ahead. Representatives from SGH's Senior Resource Center, ACP and Palliative Care emphasized the importance of making one's health ca re wishes known ahead of time in the event of a medical emergency, when an individual may not have the mental or physical ability to dictate their care . The panel also disc ussed how to complete an advance health care directive (advance directive) and provi ded other health care decision -making resources. Held at GHD, the event offered ACP and resources to approximately 25 community members. In collaboration with Sharp Hospic eCare, the SGH Senior Resource Center hosted Sharp's Aging Conference: Experience th e Spectrum of Care. Held at the La Mesa Community Center in September, Sharp shared valuable aging resources with approximately 60 community members. The conference focused on the obstacles Sharp overcame as a health system during the pandemic and how Shar p is adapting to the progressive needs of seniors in the community. The event included resource tables, an Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 181 SGH RN keynote speaker, the opportunity to stretch with an exerci se specialist and an expert panel discussion, which included a question -and-answer session. The SGH Senior Resource Center offered a Caregiver Resource Awareness event in September, where 40 attendees learned about local resources for family caregivers, including community programs, organizations and places where unpaid individuals provi ding support for their loved ones can get help. Held at the Ronald Re agan Community Center in El Cajon, the event raised awareness about caregiving, dementia and more , and included a presentation on caregiving from a Sharp -affiliated family medicine physic ian. The SGH Senior Resource Center provided community members with several caregiver resources at the event . Also in September, the SGH Senior Resource Center sponsored and provided aging care and support resources during the Fall Health Fair Saturday e vent at Westfield Parkway Plaza. The annual event featured health -related community organizations, including providers from the health care, wellness, insurance and lifesty le industries. Nearly 60 attendees learned about preventative health care measures a nd ways to improve one's lifestyle for the future. The event offered free health screenings, interactive demonstrations, resources and more. In collaboration with GHD and SMH, SGH hosted a free fall prevention and balance screening event to help raise awareness during National Fall Prevention Week in September. Held at GHD, the event offered several lectures on fall prevention, safety, balance screenings, the risk factors and health concerns affecting balance , and how to prevent falls, both at hom e and on the move. Free individual wellness and balance screenings were also offered to more than 60 attendees. In addition, t he SGH Senior Resource Center and SMH shared Sharp off erings on fall prevention as well as a variety of resources. The SGH Senio r Resource Center continued to sponsor the Grossmont Mall Walkers, a free fitness program to increase physical activity, improve balance and strength and encourage a healthy lifest yle among community adults and seniors. Participants gathered weekly at Gros smont Center to walk around the mall and perform gentle exercises led by an instructor from the SGH Senior Resource Center. Nearly 50 community members participated in the Grossmon t Mall Walkers program each month in FY 2022. In addition, the SGH Senior Re source Center continued to connect Grossmont Mall Walkers to a virtual platform each week through December 2021, enabling participants to continue to socialize and exercise during the pandemic. To help keep these individuals informed and connected, the SGH Senior Resource Center created a weekly newsletter featuring a Sharp Health News (Sharp's online news center) article, a letter from the program leader and mind -stimulating games , including word search puzzles. The SGH Senior Resource Center also hosted a summer picnic for the Grossmont Mall Walkers in June, where they spent time connecting, barbequing, eating ice -cream, singing songs and playing trivia games. The SGH Senior Resou rce Center collaborated with the City of Santee Parks & Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 182 Recreation to offer Sharp Grossmont Moves in Santee, a free monthly exercise program open to participants age s 55 and older as well as their families. Held at a park in Santee, t hese outdoor classes a re designed for active seniors to accommodate a wide range of activity level s. Approximately 20 community members attend ed the program each month. The SGH Senior Resource Center offered helpful resources through its activity calendars to assist community members during the COVID -19 pandemic. This included information on COVID -19, meal services, County of San Diego AIS and other SDC programs, hotlines, transportation, grocery shopping and more. Further, seniors, caregivers, individuals experiencing or at r isk of homelessness, individuals with chronic illnesses and vulnerable adult s with limited access to care, including those without transportation, were notified and reminded about flu and COVID -19 vaccination events . This outreach was conducted via clinic sites, SharpCare Medical Group, sharp.com, activity calendars and paper and electronic newspaper notices. In FY 2022, the SGH Senior Resource Center continued to collaborate with Sharp Community Medical Group to provide an educational speaker series to fou r assisted living centers \u2014 Mount Miguel Covenant Village, La Vida Real, Lan tern Crest and Westmont of La Mesa. Topics included heart health, skin health, sleep, brain health, diabetes and more. Throughout the year, the SGH Senior Resource Center maintai ned active relationships with organizations that enhance professional networ king and provide quality programming for seniors in SDC's east region. Organizations included the ECSSP, ECAN, County of San Diego AIS Health Promotion Committee, County of San Die go AIS Advisory Board and St. Paul's PACE (Program of All -Inclusive Care for the Elderly). In response to the COVID -19 pandemic, most meetings occurred virtually in FY 2022. Since September 2020 , the SGH Senior Resource Center has partnered with the SGH geriatric ED program, which is accredited by the American College of Emergency Physicians to provide the highest standard of care for older adults. Through this partnership in FY 2022, the SGH Senior Resource Center reached out to ap proximately 450 seniors with community resources post -discharge \u2014 including transportation, placement services, caregiving and more \u2014 to reduce the chance of a hospital readmission or ED visit. The SGH Senior Resource Center also p rovided a follow -up telep hone call after 30 days to connect with seniors who were hospitalized and provide them with helpful resources. In FY 2022, t he SGH Senior Resource Center provided follow -up calls to approximately 200 community seniors. FY 202 3 Plan SGH Senior Resource C enter will do the follow ing:177 Provide resources and support to address relevant concerns of community seniors and caregivers through in -person and phone consultations 177 Where applicable, the SGH Senior Resource Center will perform these activities as COVID -19 public health and safety guidelines allow.

Rationale The HASD&IC and SGH 2022 CHNAs identified chronic health conditions, i ncluding cancer, as one of the top community needs affecting people served by SGH . Focus groups conducted as part of the HASD&IC 2022 CHNA described the following challenges related to accessing cancer care: delayed or disrupted access to cancer screening during the COVID -19 pandemic; financial stressors, including the cost of health insurance premiums and co -pays; stigma surrounding a cancer diagnosis ; and practical issues to facilitate healing and recovery, such as housing and transportation. In addition , undocumented community members with cancer were described as being at a severe disadvantage, as many lack the necessary Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 184 insurance coverage to enroll in programs and services that could provide financial, logistical and other supportive needs. Data analys is in the SGH 2022 CHNA revealed a higher volume of hospital discharges due to cancer in communities within SDC's east region facing greater socioeconomic challenges, such as El Cajon and Spring Valley .158 Participants in the interviews conducted by community heal th workers and promotor es as part of the HASD&IC 2022 CHNA identified cancer as a major health concern among community members. Analysis of Sharp patient data from FY 2016 to 2021 showed a significant decline in cancer screening volumes during the pandemic . Further analysis is needed to assess the impact of the pandemic on screening and oncology patient volumes. Participants in the IPH Sharp Provider Survey conducted as part of the SGH 2022 CHNA process reported that patients are more fearful \u2014 of accessing health care in general and of coming in for annual cancer screenings. In addition, due to the pandemic, respondents identified populations appropriate for cancer screenings as having incr eased fear re lated to using health care services. Sharp cancer patient navigators and clinical social workers who participated in focus groups noted that cancer patients may have limited access to specialty care because health care professionals are overwhelmed. Shar p work s with cancer specialists across the system to improve access within and among various practices. The most frequently observed cancers at SGH in 2021 were (in rank order): breast (13.1% of all cancer cases), lung ( 11.6%), colorectal ( 7.0%). In total, there were 1,250 new cases of cancer at SGH in 2021. According to 2021 Sharp oncology data, 63.5% of the 156 SGH cancer patients who received the cancer psychosocial distress screening were identified as at -risk for anxiety or depression, and were referred to internal or external resources, such as social workers or community cancer resources. Sharp 2021 oncology data identified the top 10 areas of concern for Sharp c ancer patients : health insurance or money worries; worrying about the future and what lies ahead; pain; exercising and being physically active; feeling too tired; worrying about family, children or friends; in work; s leep; making a trea tment decision; and feeling nervous. In 2020, cancer was the second leading cause of death in SDC's east region.149,150 There were 890 deaths due to cancer (all typ es) in SDC's east region in 2019. The region's age -adjusted rate of death due to cancer was 150.2 deaths per 100,000 population, which is higher than the overall SDC age -adjusted rate of 135.2 per 100,000 population. In 2019, the east region's age -adjuste d death rates were higher than the rates for SDC for the following cancers: bladder, brain, colorectal, female breast and reproductive, kidney, liver, lung and non -Hodgkin's lymphoma. In 2019, 17.8% of all cancer death s in SDC's east region were due to lun g cancer, 8.8% to female breast cancer, 8.5% to colorectal cancer, 7.0% to pancreatic cancer, 6.5% to prostate cancer and 6.4% to female reproductive cancer. 178 Cancers of the hematopoietic and reticuloendo thelial system include various malignancies that impact the blood and imm une system, such as Hodgkin's and non -Hodgkin's lymphoma, leukemia and myeloma. Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 185 The American Cancer Society (ACS) estimates that in 2022, th ere will be 189,220 new cancer cases d iagnosed and 60,970 cancer deaths in the state of California.179 According to findings from the ACS Cancer Facts & Figures 2022 report , older age and being female are the strongest risk factors for breast cancer. Potent ially modifiable factors associated wit h increased risk include weight gain after the age of 18 and/or being overweight or obese, menopausal hormone therapy, alcohol consumption and physical inactivity.180 The same report indicates that people with lower so cioeconomic status have higher cancer de ath rates than those with higher socioeconomic status, regardless of demographic factors such as race/ethnicity. Racial and ethnic disparities in the cancer burden largely reflect disproportionate poverty. Social ine qualities, including communication barri ers and provider/patient assumptions, can affect interactions between patients and physicians and contribute to miscommunication and/or delivery of substandard care.180 A recent study by the ACS found that at least 42% of newly diagnosed cancer cases in the U.S. \u2014 about 805, 600 cases in 2022 \u2014 are potentially avoidable. This includes the 19% of all cancers caused by tobacco use as well as the 18% caused by a combination of excess body weight, alcohol consumptio n, poor nutrition and physical inactivity.180 Studies have shown that patient navigators contribute to better access and continuity of care, which offers a promising approach to better care integration. In cancer care, navigators help patients move through the entire care continuum, from prevention to survivorship. Navigators typically identify individual needs and barriers to care, educating patients and communities, and linking patients with different care providers.181 According to the National Institutes of Health, clinical trials, a part of clinical research, are at the heart of all medical advances. Clinical trials explore new ways to prevent, detect or treat disease, and offer hope for many people as well as an opportunity to help researchers find better treatments for others in the future.182 Objectives Provide cancer education and support to patients and community members Provide cancer resources and education at community events Provide cancer patient na vigation and support services to the community Provide genetic testing and counseling Participate in cancer clinical trials, including screening and enrolling patients 179 American Cancer Society ( ACS) Cancer Statistics Center (2022), California at a Glance . 180 ACS (2022), Cancer Facts & Figures 2022 . 181 European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies (in partnership with the WHO ) (2022).

Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 186 FY 2022 Report of Activities The Cancer Centers of Sharp HealthCare (Cancer Centers of Sharp) include the David and Donna Long Center for Cancer Treatment at SGH (David and Donna Long Cancer Center), the Laurel Amtower Cancer Institute and Neuro -Oncology Center at SMH and the Douglas & Nancy Barnhart Cancer Center at SCVMC. The Cancer Ce nters of Sharp are accredited by the American College of Surgeons Commission on Cancer (CoC) as an Integrated Network Cancer Program (INCP), demonstrating Sharp's commitmen t to meeting rigorous standards and improving the quality of care for patients with cancer. In addition, the David and Donna Long Cancer Center received full accreditation by the National Accreditation Program for Breast Cancer in FY 2021 for providing the best possible care to patients with diseases of the breast. Also in FY 2021, the Ca ncer Centers of Sharp received APEx (Accreditation Program for Excellence) accreditation by the American Society for Radiation Oncology, in recognition of Sharp's dedicatio n to promoting effective communication and coordinated radiation oncology treatment, as well as engaging patients and their families as partners in care. Although several in -person health fairs and events were postponed or canceled in FY 2022, the Cancer Centers of Sharp, including the David and Donna Long Cancer Center, continued to pa rticipate in virtual events and webinars. This included the Sharp Women's Health Conference . During the event in May, the Cancer Centers of Sharp offered education on the proper breast -self exam technique and the importance of performing this exam monthly; information on cancer support services including nurse navigation, social work, nutrition, education and available classes; several cancer resources; as well as a br eakout session from Sharp registered dietitians (RD) focus ed on cancer and diet, including lifestyle changes to help reduce the risk of cancer or cancer recurrence. In FY 2022, the Cancer Centers of Sharp, including the David and Donna Long Cancer Center and Sharp outpatient oncology social workers, continued to provide a variety of free virtu al classes and support groups for more than 1,700 community members impacted by cancer. The support groups are intended to create safe places to explore patient exper iences living with cancer , receiving treatment, and beyond. This included two, twice -mont hly breast cancer support groups, one held during the day and another in the evening, which allowed women in all stages of breast cancer \u2014 from recent diagnosis to su rvivorship \u2014 to share experiences and coping strategies. A general cancer support group wa s offered twice monthly to address the educational and emotional needs of people living with any kind of cancer. This group provided encouragement and hope in a safe environment , as well as the opportunity to discuss experiences and coping tactics during a ny phase of treatment. The weekly Art and Chat support group offered patients with cancer, survivors and their loved ones a combination of conversation and relaxing d rawing methods to increase focus, creativity, self-confidence and personal well -being. The Man Cave support group for men with cancer provided a welcoming environment to explore important issues that can arise when coping with cancer, including work, relat ionships, family and overall control. Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 187 Although this group traditionally met monthly, in re sponse to community need during the COVID -19 pandemic, the group began meeting twice a month. In addition, the new virtual format enabled SGH to expand this group's r each to individuals living outside of SDC. Furthering its support for those with cancer, t he David and Donna Long Cancer Center continued to provide the Wall of Hope and Inspiration \u2014 a special art installation created in 2015 for patients and visitors to write words of wisdom, advice and encouragement. The Cancer Centers of Sharp also offere d monthly support groups for the following community members: individuals living with a brain tumor or brain cancer; care partners of individuals living with a brain tumor or brain cancer; adults who have a loved one with any type of cancer; young patients living with cancer at any stage; and patients and survivors of head and neck cancer. New in FY 2022, the Cancer Centers of Sharp offered two additional support group s \u2014 one in Spanish for patients with any type of cancer, and a group specifically targeted to cancer survivors, which explored the experiences of people who have finished their treatment but are still fac ing the day -to- day challenges of cancer survivorship , including fear of recurrence and long -term, life - altering side -effects. In addition, the Cancer Centers of Sharp offered a biweekly support group for individuals living with any type of advanced cancer. Over 620 attendees participated in one or more of t hese support groups throughout FY 2022. In partnership with the Cancer Centers of Sharp, the David and Donna Long Cancer Center continued to host free educational classes for patients and community members living with cancer. Through the monthly Lunch and Learn Cancer Education series, community members, patients and families were invited to hear local experts speak about a unique cancer -related topic each month, such as cancer and sexuality ; communicat ing with one's health care team ; communicati ng with loved ones ; how to prepare for the worst while hoping for the best ; humor and cancer ; care for the caregivers ; self-care; stress management ; the science of making healthy lifestyle changes ; self-talk; talking to children about cancer ; and cancer and aging. Over 15 classes were offered, reaching more than 390 individuals through virtual platforms . Additionally, the programs were recorded and shared with another 75 individuals who weren't able to attend the live webinar. Other educational classes offer ed by the Cancer Centers of Sharp included nutrition management and healthy eating before, during and after treatment; nutrition and healthy eating during and after breast cancer treatment; cancer and lymphedema \u2014 a condition where swelling occurs because of damage or blockage in the lymphatic system; and structured healing art activities to improve ov erall well-being. Since the classes are offered virtual ly, allowing individuals to participate in the comfort of their own homes, attendance increased compare d to pre -pandemic levels . Throughout the year, the David and Donna Long Cancer Center offered fre e virtual workshops for patients and community members . This included ACP workshops provided in collaboration with Sharp's ACP department . Led by Sharp HospiceCare team members with specialized training in ACP, t he webinars helped participants identify the ir personal health care choices, communicat e their wishe s to loved ones, and Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 188 develop their advance directive . In addition, the Cancer Centers of Sharp and the David and Donna Long Cancer Center offered four rotating monthly workshops for cancer patients an d their loved ones. The Relaxation and Quieting the Mind workshop helped patients with cancer and their loved ones manage the stress, anxiety and difficult emotions that may accompany a cancer diagnosis. The Chemo Brain Workshop: Improving Memory and Conce ntration addressed memory problems related to chemothera py and other cancer treatments. An additional workshop related to chemo brain was added over the summer, titled How to Help Someone with Chemo Brain - A Class for Loved Ones. Attended by 75 individual s, this program was offered as a result of hearing from patients that their loved ones should have more information on how to support them during their experience with cancer -related cognitive impairment. The Scanxiety: Managing the Fear of Cancer Recurren ce workshop helped patients understand and manag e anxiet y related to tests and scans. The Managing Sleep and Fatigue workshop assisted patients with cancer and their loved ones with fatigue and sleep issues both during and after treatment. The Cancer Cente rs of Sharp also offered a virtual Relaxation Skills wor kshop each week, where a clinician offered breathing and other relaxation exercises and well as guided meditations to reduce tension and stress in the body and mind. In total, more than 420 community members attended these classes and workshops in FY 2022 . In honor of Breast Cancer Awareness Month in October, the David and Donna Long Cancer Center promoted awareness through community outreach , provi ding coffee cup sleeves and information on the impor tance of breast cancer screening for anyone stopping by the SGH coffee cart. Also i n October, the Cancer Centers of Sharp offered a webinar titled Surviving Cancer: Thriving After a Diagnosis to more than 50 individuals. At th e webinar, a Sharp -affiliated physician discussed her personal journey with breast cancer, and Sharp oncology social workers and a dietitian presented on thriving after a cancer diagnosis, nutrition and exercise for survivors , and cancer -related cognitive impairment. Throughout FY 2 022, SGH helped raise community awareness of cancer through television interviews on CBS News 8 - San Diego, KUSI News and 10News - ABC San Diego KGTV. Hospital physicians from a variety of specialties, including oncology and pulmonology , as well as an onc ology social worker and breast cancer survivor, shared cancer information through these outlets. Topics included breast cancer risk factors and screening and Lung Cancer Awareness Month through advocacy via Crystal's Angels and the American Lung Associatio n (ALA). Numerous health -related articles were also shared through sharp.com, Sharp Health News and SGH's monthly e -newsletters. Further, in March, a video shared on sharp.com featured a n SGH -affiliated urologist who introduced Aquablation therapy \u2014 an surgical treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia (prostate gland enlargement). The video received over 6,000 views on YouTube. SGH's Burr Heart & Lung Clin ic provides early detection and treatment of pulmonary nodules, lung c ancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Beginning in Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 189 September, the clinic sponsored San Diego Community Connections with the ALA - San Diego. San Diego Community Connect ions, nicknamed \"Dinner with the Docs,\" is a series of free virtual in formation sessions that address helpful and timely topics related to various lung health issues. The sessions, hosted by a pulmonologist from UC San Diego Health and Tony Gwynn Jr. of th e San Diego Padres, feature expert guest speakers from across SDC. At three of the virtual information sessions, experts discussed Lung Cancer Screening During the Pandemic, Lung Cancer Screening and Lung Cancer Detection Evaluation. To help guide and su pport patients and their families before, during and after the course of cancer treatment, t he David and Donna Long Cancer Center team offers a licensed clinical social worker (LCSW), a dietitian, genetics counselors, a clinical trials nurse and cancer pat ient navigators, including a certified breast health navigator . The LC SW, a certified oncology social worker, offers psychosocial services (assessments, crisis intervention, counseling, bereavement, cognitive behavioral therapy and stress management), supp ort group leadership, and advocacy and resources for transportation, p alliative care and hospice, food and financial assistance. In FY 2022, the David and Donna Long Cancer Center also connected patient and family members to community services , such as the ACS, San Diego Brain Tumor Foundation, Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, Lung Cancer Alliance, Mama's Kitchen, 2 -1-1, Jewish Family Service of San Diego's senior adult programs, Safe Parking Program, and food pantry, as well as other food and financial assis tance programs. The LCSW served more than 520 patients and family memb ers in FY 2022, as well as provided an additional 240 community member consultations regarding support groups and other David and Donna Long Cancer Center services and community resource s. Due to the COVID -19 pandemic, many patients with cancer and their f amily members experienced increased isolation compounded by a shortage of available community support services. Consequently, the LCSW noted higher -than-normal distress levels in patient s and an increase in requests for assistance, both emotional and pract ical. In addition, the Cancer Centers of Sharp, including the David and Donna Long Cancer Center, partnered with ACS to coordinate transportation at no cost for patients receiving cancer treatment, as well as provid ing patients with essential lodging servi ces, as needed. The breast health navigator is an RN certified in breast health , who assists patients with breast cancer and their families with navigating the health care system. The breast health navigator offers support, guidance, education, as well a s financial assistance referrals and recommendations for community resources. Through collaboration with community clinics \u2014 including FHCSD, Neighborhood Healthcare and Borrego Health \u2014 the breast health navigator identifies patients who may financially b enefit from referrals to Medi -Cal or the Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Program (BCCTP). Offered through the California Department of Health Care Services, the BCCTP provides urgen tly needed cancer treatment coverage for unfunded or underfunded patie nts who do not qualify for Medi -Cal, but whose income may meet eligibility guidelines. Patients with psychosocial support needs are referred to the David and Donna Long Cancer Center 's LCSW or various local and national resources. In FY 2022, the breast he alth navigator provided navigation assistance to approximately 275 Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 190 patients with breast cancer, including many with late -stage diagnoses. Since 2014, a cancer patient navigator has bee n designated for patients with cancers other than breast, including pa tients with head and neck cancers, lung cancer and esophageal cancers as well as any cancer patient with complex care needs. The cancer patient navigator supports patients and their fami ly members through care coordination and connection to needed resource s, including transportation, translation needs, financial assistance, speech therapy, nutritional support, feeding tube support, social work services and more. In addition, the cancer pa tient navigator offers psychosocial support and education about the si de effects of radiation therapy. In FY 2022, the cancer patient navigator assisted approximately 125 patients and their families. The David and Donna Long Cancer Center's dietitian assists patients receiving radiation therapy or combined radiation and che motherapy who are at high risk for malnutrition. This most often includes patients with head and neck, esophageal, lung, pancreatic and pelvic cancers \u2014 including some cervical and rectal. The dietitian provided one -on-one nutrition assessments, education and follow -up to approximately 150 patients in FY 2022. In FY 2022, the Cancer Centers of Sharp launched a private Facebook group titled Sharp HealthCare Cancer Patient Community. This group was created for cancer patient s and their loved ones to foster a sense of community and connection as well as provide reliable information, thoughtful content, live discussions, and a quick and e asy way to view current program and service offerings. This Facebook page has more than 150 participants who are able to acce ss up -to-date and vetted information, as well as post about issues of concern related to themselves and others. Beginning in July 2021, the Cancer Centers of Sharp formed a taskforce to explore the development of a continuum of care for patients experien cing chemo brain, more formally known as cancer -related cognitive impairment. Building off the existing webinar for chemo brain, th e group created a patient flow, from diagnosis onward , developing educational materials, an additional webinar for loved ones , one -on-one assessment and treatment by a Sharp speech language pathologist, an eight -session class taught by the speech language pathologist and oncology social worker, and a mentor program for graduates. These two cohorts featured a total of 14 particip ants, who provided positive feedback on the experience and degree of support they received. This continuum of care is the first of its type in San Diego. From June to November 2021, Sharp's systemwide INCP participated on the ACS CoC's Plan-Do-Study -Act (PDSA ) clinical study titled Return to Cancer Screening. As a systemwide effort, Sharp participated in this clinical study to increase the pre -pandemic screening rates for both breast and colorectal cancers by 10% and reduce the backlog in screenings cause d by pa ndemic disruptions. Various departments implemented measures to bring patients in for screenings, which included social media campaigns, news stories, and personal outreach for booking appointments, mailings and reminders. Findings were reported in Februar y 2022: Sharp's breast cancer screening goal Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 191 reached 91% of the target and colorectal cancer screenings exceeded the goal, with 103% of target . Beginning in January, Sharp participated in a second PDSA clinical study with the CoC addressing smoking cessat ion as a means to improve patient cancer risk and treatment outcomes. This study reviewed whether all newly diagnosed cancer patients are being asked about their smoking status and offered cessation resources as appropriate . The initial data collect ion sug gested that Sharp providers are consistently asking this question during consultation appointments (99% of the time) but smoking cessation resources offered to patients varied and were inconsistent across the system. Sharp improved its process by cr eating a new, Sharp -branded patient resource to be shared with all cancer treatment providers. Final smoking cessation data will be collected and reported in February 2023. For more than 20 years, the Clinical Oncology Research (COR) Department at Sharp has cond ucted clinical trials to facilitate the discovery of new and improved treatments for cancer patients and to enhance scientific knowledge for the larger health and research communities. Sharp's COR program includes a balanced portfolio of industry - sponsored , investigator -initiated and National Cancer Institute (NCI) studies. These studies explore the efficacy and safety of novel cancer therapeutic agents or technologies to benefit the most common cancer types. NCI studies focus on optimizing the stand ard of care. Sharp's COR collaborates with 22 physician -investigators throughout SDC's south, east and central regions. This brings innovative treatments close to research participants' homes and minimizes the travel time for their care and study participa tion. In FY 2022, the COR pre -screened 400 patients for participation in oncology clinical trials. As a result, 33 patients consented to participate in cancer research studies. Clinical trials focused on multiple types of cancer, including , but not limi ted to , brain, breast, colon, head and neck, lung, lymphoma, pancreatic and prostate. Sharp is the only health care organization in SDC to be accredited by the Association for the Accreditation of Human Research Protection Programs, demonstrating Sharp's commitme nt to rigorous standards for ethics, quality and protection for research participants. FY 2023 Plan The David and Donna Long Cancer Center will do the following:162 Provide cancer education, resourc es and breast self -exam demonstrations at community health fairs and events, as well as through social media Provide free cancer support groups to community members Collaborate with the Cancer Centers of Sharp to provide v irtual workshops on various cance r wellness topics, including Spanish -language options Provide monthly workshops on managing scanxiety, relaxation, chemo brain and more Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 192 Host a free monthly Lunch and Learn educational series for patients with cancer, survivors and their loved ones Provid e ongoing personalized education, information, support and guidance to patients with cancer and their loved ones Connect individuals to c ommunity resources to help them manage their illness In collaboration with the Sharp ACP department , provide an ACP wo rkshop for patients and community members with cancer and their loved ones Screen and enroll patients with cancer in clinical trials Provide education on cancer and available treatments for health professionals Offer classes to address cognitive impairmen ts related to cancer and cancer treatments Virtually educate community members about lifestyle choices for reducing breast cancer risk Partner with community clinics to share best practices in the care of patients with cancer and to help patients establish medical services Offer additional webinars for patients with cancer and community members Collaborate with the ACS and ALA to raise cance r awareness and educate the community Provide access to the private Sharp HealthCare Cancer Patient Community Faceboo k group Offer two new support groups \u2014 one for cancer survivors and one for Spanish speaking patients Participate in and provide fundraising for events to support cancer research in SDC Implement a patient and family advisory counsel Identified Communit y Need: Maternal and Prenatal Care, and Women's and Postpartum Health Services and Education Rationale references the findings of the SGH 2022 CHNA, HASD&IC 2022 CHNA or the most recent SDC community health statistics unless otherwise indicated. Rationale The SGH 2022 CHNA identified maternal and prenatal care, including high -risk pregnancy, as one of the priority health and social needs affecting community members served by SGH. Within this need, the following themes were identified: declining fertility trends; matern al and infant health; infant mortality; high -risk pregnancy; and behavioral health. Participants in the IPH Sharp Provider Survey conducted as part of the SGH 2022 CHNA process identified pregnant women as one of the population of patients impacted by COVI D-19 in relation to increased anxiety and depression, and decreased access to behavioral health care . In addition, participants identified maternal and infant health with a focus on the Black community as an educational topic of particular in terest and imp ortance to employee professional development. Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 193 According to hospital data presented in the SGH 2022 CHNA, nearly three -quarters (73.9%) of women admitted for preterm labor in 2020 were enrolled in Medi -Cal, and 80.5% were ages 18 to 34 years. In addition, 40.0% of preterm babies were identified as Hispanic or Latino, and 54.0% were male. Hospital data analysis also identified disparities among some demographic groups in relation to pregnancy -related inpatient admissions. For example, Black or A frican American women accounted for 7.9% of all female inpatients at SGH, but 28.6% of admissions for high -risk pregnancy. Similarly, Hispanic or Latino women represented 26.7% of femal e inpatient discharges, but 44.4% of gestational diabetes inpatients. In 2020 , SDC's east region had 383 low birth weight (LBW )183 births, which accounted for 6.5% of total births for the region. In the same year, there were 67 very low birth weight (VLBW )184 births in the east region, or 1.1% of total births. In SDC overall, LBW births accounted for 6.7% of births while VLBW births accounted for 1.1% of all births.185 There were 522 preterm births in SDC's east region in 2020, representing 8.8% of all births in the region.185 In 2020, 5,115 live births received early prenatal care in SDC's east region, which translates to 86.4% of all live births in the region. This was lower than the percentage of live births receiving early prenatal care in SDC overall ( 88.8%), and the second lowest among all SDC regions.185 Proven strategies to increase the use of prenatal care include affordable health coverage, expedited health coverage for uninsured pregnant women, insurance coverage that includes hea lth education and risk counseling, outreach a nd assistance with health coverage enrollment and accessing affordable prenatal services, use of safety net health providers, culturally and linguistically appropriate prenatal services, home visits for high -risk pregnant women, coaching and support from t rained and certified doulas and community health workers, group care approaches to reduce costs and enhance care, and transportation assistance.186 In 2020 , California hospitals performed better than the national average in implementing various maternal care practices and policies to improve breastfeeding outcomes, including immediate postpartum care, rooming -in, feeding practices, discharge support and institutional management.187 According to Live Well San Diego's (LWSD ) San Diego County Report Card on Children and Families , 2021 , breastfeeding enhances immunity to disease, decreases the rate and severity of diarrhea and infections in children, is associated with healthy development and decreased risk of childhood obesity and reduces lifelong ri sks for chronic health problems. Mothers who breastfeed may have a reduced risk of some cancers, quicker postpartum recovery time, and less work missed due to child illness.186 According to 2021 CHIS data, 28.2% of women ages 18 to 64 years in SDC's east region were obese (BMI > 30), higher than SDC overall (20.3%).148 183 Low Birth Weight refers to birth weight less than 2,500 grams (approximately 5 pounds ( lbs.), 8 ounces). 184 Very Low Birth Weight refers to birth weight less than 1,500 grams (approximately 3 lbs., 5 ounces). 185 County of San Diego HHSA (2022), Materna l, Child, and Family Health Services Statistics . 186 The Children's Initiative (2022). Live Well San Diego Report Card on Children, Families, a nd Community, 2021. 187 CDC (2021), CDC Survey of Maternity Practices in Infant Nutrition and Care : California 2020 Report . Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 194 According to the CDC, being overweight increases the risk of pregnan cy complications, including preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, stillbirth and cesarean delivery. Obesity during pregnancy is also associated with increased use of health care and physician services, and longer hospital stays for delivery.188 Factors associa ted with preterm birth include maternal age, race, socioeconomic status, tobacco use, substance use, stress, prior preterm births, carrying more than one baby and infection.188 Although just 1 in 10 U.S. infan ts were born preterm in 2021, the year represented the highest rate reported in at least 14 years. The preterm birth rate rose by 4% between 2020 and 2021, and racial and ethnic differences in preterm birth rates continued to persist. The rate of preterm b irth among Black women ( 14.8%) in 2021 was about 50% higher than the rate among white or Hispanic women ( 9.5% and 10.2% respectively).189 According to the California Task Force on Status of Maternal Mental Health Care, depression and anxiety are the most com mon complication associated with pregnancy and childbirth. These disorders affect up to 1 in 5 mothers, or approximately 100,000 women in California each year, yet research suggests that most women remain undiagnosed and untreated.190 The National Center o n Substance Abuse and Child Welfare identified ways that states can address the effects of prenatal substance exposure, including: effective cross -system collaboration; addressing stigma and establishing trust among pregnant women with substance use disord ers (SUD) ; identifying existing practices that inhibit families from accessing services; and ensuring successful statewide implementation through op en and ongoing communication.191 Objectives Conduct outreach and education activities for women on a variety of topics, including prenatal care and parenting skills Demonstrate best practices in breastfeeding and maternity care, and provide education and support to help new mothers meet their person al breastfeeding goals Collaborate with community organizations to help raise awareness of women's health issues and services Provide critical prenatal services to low -income and underserved women in SDC's east region Participate in professional associatio ns and disseminate research related to women's services and pren atal health 188 CDC Division of Re productive Health, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (2022), Maternal Infant Health . 189 Martin, J.A., Hamilton, B.E., and Osterman, M.J.K.

Working Together to Address the Needs of Infants with Prenatal Substance Exposure, Their Families, and Caregivers . Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 195 FY 202 2 Report of Activities In FY 2022, Sharp Grossmont Hospital for Women & Newborns (SGHWN) (formerly the SGH Women's Health Center) provided education, outreach and support t o help meet the unique needs of women, mothers and newborns thro ughout SDC's east region. SGHWN includes the SGH Prenatal Clinic, which provides services and resources specifically to the hospital's underinsured patients. The SGH Prenatal Clinic offers comprehensive obstetric services, postpartum assessments and indivi dualized care plans to determine and address patients' strengths, risks, needs and goals. In FY 2022, SGHWN's free support groups helped women and families adapt to caring for their newborn. Offered twice per week, the breastfeeding support group provided a comfortable environment to assist mothers experiencing breastfeeding challenges, as well as an opportunity to ask questions and obtain support on their new journey. Facilitated by RN lactat ion consultants, the group served more than 120 attendees. The support group was held virtually throughout the year, as well as in -person beginning in July. SGHWN also provided breastfeeding support via telephone calls throughout the year. A weekly virtual postpartum, perinatal mood and anxiety disorder support group, led by a LCSW , supported more than 40 mothers and offered psychoeducation. Through the support group, mothers with babies up to 12 months of age who experienced symptoms of depression or anxiety shared their experiences, learned coping strategies and recei ved professional referrals. A variety of educati onal classes were provided to prepare mothers and families for their baby's arrival. Through the breastfeeding class, mothers -to-be learned about the advantages of breastfeeding and basic breastfeeding tips, such as positioning and the use of breast pumps. Designed for first -time parents, the Baby Care Basics class provided education on infant care, including car -seat safety, signs and symptoms of illness, infant nutrition and bathing, and hands -on practice w ith diapering, dressing and swaddling. Other offe rings by SGHWN in FY 2022 included classes on labor comfort measures and relaxation skills, childbirth preparation, preparation for going from the hospital to home with a baby. Due to COVID -19 health and saf ety guidelines, these classes were offered virtua lly. In addition, SGHWN offered women's health resources from pre -conception to post -menopaus e during the Sharp Women's Health Conference . Further , in February, May and June, SGH, including SGHWN, hosted thr ee virtual Planning for Pregnancy events that edu cated more than 50 attendees on preparing the body for pregnancy, having a baby later in life, reproductive planning, fertility schedules and challenges, and more. In October, SGHWN hosted its ninth Annual Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) Reunion. At t he Sesame Street -themed drive -thru event, NICU caregivers celebrated with 25 families whose babies were treated in intensive care. Many of these little ones were born premature or with other serious health c oncerns but went on to graduate from intensive ca re. Greeted with smiles and delicious treats, children showed off their costumes and received special attention from their favorite characters, including staff members who may have cared for them during thei r NICU stay . Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 196 SGHWN has sustained several process improvements to increase breastfeeding rates among new mothers and continues to explore and participate in opportunities to share these best practices with the broader health care community. Examples of pro cess improvements that have helped increase exclu sive breastfeeding rates include delaying infant baths past eight hours of age and encouraging ongoing skin to skin contact. Following the implementation of the 10 Steps to Successful Breastfeeding initiativ e in 2012, SGHWN has pursued various quality stra tegies to promote exclusive breastfeeding and breastmilk in the NICU. In addition, educational resources provided at community clinics and in the hospital's childbirth education classes have been updated to reflect best practices in breastfeeding for mothe rs and their families. NICU nurses also continued to encourage mothers to use a pump log to document and increase accountability of their 24 -hour breastmilk volumes. In addition, staff worked with mothers of NICU babies to incorporate early intervention st rategies that promote the establishment of a sufficient breastmilk supply in the weeks following a premature birth. SGHWN also continued to assist mothers of premature infants (28 to 34 weeks gestation) with tracking their breastmilk production in order to establish adequate breastmilk supply at two weeks postpartum. As a result of these comprehensive efforts, SGHWN increased the exclusive newborn breastfeeding rate at discharge (for all newborns) from 49% in 2011 to 55% in 2022. In addition, in 2015, the SGH Prenatal Clinic joined the Breastfeeding -Friendly Community Health Centers project (BFCHC) \u2014 an initiative of LWSD and funded through a grant from the First 5 Commission of San Diego. Out of six clinics participating in the BFCHC collaboration, the SG H Prenatal Clinic was selected as the pilot location to help establish Baby -Friendly USA guidelines around breastfeeding education and support during the prenatal period and after discharge, and to support other prenatal clinics in achieving Baby -Friendly USA standards. The pilot program ended in 2016, however SGH maintains its engagement in the BFCHC to ensure sustainability of the model. The SGH Prenatal Clinic offers a variety of prenatal support services for vulnerable pregnant women in the east region. Throughout FY 2022, SGH Prenatal Clinic midwives provided in -kind help at Neighborhood Healthcare in El Cajon to support the underserved population in SDC's east region. This included more than 1,000 hours of care for pregnant women, with midwife coverage five days per week. The SGH Prenatal Clinic also continued to participate in the California Department of Public Health ( CDPH ) Comprehen sive Perinatal Services Program to offer comprehensive prenatal clini cal and social services to low -income, low -literacy women with Medi -Cal benefits. To assist women in achieving the best outcome for their unique prenatal care journey, midwives and nurse practitioners provide prenatal care, with perinatologist and OB-GYN consultations immediately available as needed . Services included health education, nutritional guidance, psychosocial support, language translation services, Medi -Cal enrollment services a nd childbirth classes, which are provided by licensed RDs, counselors , certified lactation consultants, health educators and comprehensive perinatal health care workers. Women with a current diabetes diagnosis were referred Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 197 to the SGH Diabetes Education Program, while women with nutrition concerns were referred to an SGH RD or the SGH Diabetes Education Program. Women with elevated BMIs received education and glucometers to measure their blood sugar levels and prevent the development of gestational diabetes. Despite the COVID -19 pandemic, the SGH Prenatal Clinic continued to provide in -person services throughout the year while maintaining social distancing guidelines. SGHWN continued its partnership with Vista Hill ParentCare to assist women with substance use or psychosocial issues during pregnancy. The SGH Pre natal Clinic screened women for mood disorders, domestic violence, homelessness, trauma, legal problems, substance use, sexual abuse and challenges with acculturation for refugees and immigrants. If concerns were identified, a treatment plan was developed including follow-up from an SGH Prenatal Clinic social worker for the remainder of the pregnancy and up to 10 weeks postpartum. These approaches have been shown to reduce both LBW rates and health care costs for women and infants. SGHWN also provided women with referr als to a variety of community resources, including, but not limited to 2-1-1, San Diego Women, Infants , and Children (WIC) , and the County of San Diego Public Health Nursing. In FY 2022, SGHWN participated in and partnered with several commun ity organiza tions and advisory boards for maternal and child health, including College Area Pregnancy Services, East County Pregnancy Clinic, San Diego Adolescent Pregnancy and Parenting Program, California School -Age Families Education, WIC, 2 -1-1, Partne rship for Sm oke-Free Families, San Diego County Advisory Board, Beacon Council's Patient Safety Collaborative, ACNL, Perinatal Care Network, the local chapter of AWHONN, California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative, California Per inatal Quali ty Care Collaborative, American Association of Critical -Care Nurses (AACN ) - Clinical Scene Investigator Academy, and the County of San Diego Public Health Nursing Advisory Board. Due to the COVID -19 pandemic, several organizations met virtuall y. FY 202 3 Plan SGHWN will do the following:192 Provide free breastfeeding, postpartum and new parent support groups, including virtual sessions Provide parenting education classes, including virtual classes Participate in wellne ss events for women with a focus on l ifestyle tips to enhance overall health Share evidence -based maternity care practices through presentations at professional conferences Provide prenatal clinical and social services as well as education to low-income, low - literacy women through the SGH Pre natal Clinic 192 Where applicable, S harp Grossmont Hospital for Women & Newborns will perform these activiti es as COVID -19 public health and safety guidelines allow. Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 198 Provide a drive -thru NICU graduate reunion for former NICU patients and their family members Explore opportunities to pro vide diapers to low -income parents in SDC Identified Community Need: Health Education and Wellness Rationale references the findings of the SGH 2022 CHNA, HASD&IC 2022 CHNA or the most recent SDC community health statistics unless otherwise indicated. Rationale The HASD&IC and SGH 2022 CHNAs identified access to health care, aging care & support, behavioral health, child ren & youth well -being, chronic health conditions, community safety, and economic stability as the priority health and social needs affecting the community members served by SGH. HASD&IC's community engagement efforts described health literacy as a barrier in accessing health care. To help people understand basic health information, there is a need for more education on preventive health care, heal thy lifestyles and understanding the differences between sources of care (e.g., when to use urgent care v ersus the emergency room). Participants noted that health care settings should use simple, plain language forms to help people understand health inform ation. Also, according to the HASD&IC 2022 CHNA, the pandemic further exacerbated existing health literacy cha llenges, such as people not understanding their health insurance benefits, not knowing whom to call to access services and difficulty identifying where to get care. The majority (96%) of Sharp Insight Community Survey respondents did not participate in S harp's programs to connect individuals to support services or resources, which suggests that more can be done to promote community awareness abou t these services. Among those who did participate, programs accessed included: diabetes care and education prog rams (12%) , nutrition programs (6%) and weight management programs (6%). Data analysis in Sharp's 2022 CHNAs revealed a higher volume of hospita l discharges due to CVD and Type 2 diabetes communities facing greater socioeconomic challenges within SDC's ea st region, such as El Cajon and Spring Valley.151 In 2020, disease s of the heart were the leading cause of death in SDC's east region, followed by cancer and COVID -19.149,150 According to 2021 CHIS data, the self -reported obesity rate for adults age 18 and older in SDC's east region was 30. 2%, higher than the self -reported obesity rate for SDC overall ( 21.7%).148 In California, the self -reported obesity rate in 2020 was 30.3%. Prevalence of obesity decreased as education levels increased, highlighting the need for health education as a tool for reducing obesity rates.193 193 CDC (2022), Adult Obesity Prevalence Maps . Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 199 A study published in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly suggests that risks of COVID -19-related hospitalization, ICU admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, and death are higher with increasing BMI, particularly among adults under the age of 65.194 Accor ding to th e CDC, the leading causes of preventable death include obesity - related conditions, such as heart disease, stroke, Type 2 diabetes and some types of cancer.195 According to an article Social and Environmental Factors Influencing Obesity , obesity prevalence is significantly associated with sex, racial or ethnic identity, and socioeconomic status. Higher odds of obesity are attributed to multiple factors, including environments experi encing deprivation, disorder, or high crime; proliferation of high calorie, energy dense food options that are perceived as more affordable; and reductions in occupational and transportation -related physical activity .196 According to data from the San Diego Hunger Coalition, in 2019, approximately one - quarter of people in SDC were nutrition insecure \u2014 including 44% of Hispanic or Latino individuals. Due to the COVID -19 pandemic, the percent of SDC's population experiencing nutrition insecurity increased to a peak of 39% (1.3 million people) in April 2020, then leveled off to 30% (1 million people) in November 2020. As of June 2021, nutrition insecurity continued to affect nearly 1 in 3 SDC residents.145 In 2021, 28. 2% of east region residents living below 200% of the FPL reported enrollment in the CalFresh program.143 In 2021 , 27.3% of adults in SDC's east region reported that they would not get COVID -19 vaccine if available, higher than SDC overall ( 23.7%).143 As of September 2022, the percentage of population vaccinated against COVID -19 in SDC's east region was 71.2%. This was lower than SDC overall (83.2%).197 Recent data su ggests the COVID -19 vaccine 's effectiveness at preventing infection or severe illness wanes over time, especially for people ages 65 and older and those who are immunocompromised. The CDC recommends COVID -19 vaccines for everyone 6 months and older, and bo osters for everyone 5 years and older, if eligible. Data show that a n mRNA booster increases the immune response, which improves protection against getting a serious COVID -19 infection.198 According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, a significantly greater percentage (2.7%) of patients with a COVID -19 diag nosis experienced the onset of a new behavioral health condition following their diagnosis compared to those who tested negative (1.0%). The most commonly reported b ehavioral health concerns were anxiety and major depression. The odds of developing a menta l health condition after COVID -19 diagnosis were significantly higher among individuals with health -related social needs associated with childhood upbringing, educat ion, employment or housing.199 194 Kompaniyets L, Goodman AB, Belay B, et al.

More than 160 community members attended the virtual sessions. During Lung Cancer Awarene ss Month in November, SGH partnered with ALA - San Diego to raise awareness about the leading cause of cancer deaths in the U.S., lung cancer, and sa ve lives through lung cancer screening and early detection. As part of the partnership, SGH offered a varie ty of resources to help people lead a healthier life, as well as support programs to improve lung health and prevent lung disease. SGH's Burr Heart & Lung Clinic also sponsored and supported ALA's LUNG FORCE Walk, which helped raise awareness about pulmona ry health as well as funds to treat lung cancer, improve lung health and protect clean air for all. Two weeks p rior to the walk , SGH and ALA - San Di ego were on -site to help register participants. At the end of January, SGH participated in the walk at Libe rty Station and offered essential information about lung health to approximately 1,000 participants. At the walk, SGH's chief executive officer share d information about the Burr Heart & Lung Clinic and greeted participants as they arrived. SGH further supported the ALA - San Diego as Southern California's top professional athletes perform ed their off -field and off -court talents during Champions Unite . The one - of-a kind talent competition featured favorite athletes from various sports clubs to raise awaren ess about lung health; prevent lung disease; and support lung health for all, including ensuring racial health equity, overcoming COVID -19, helping y outh quit smoking and vaping, and ensuring cleaner, healthier air. The show was aired on Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 203 Spectrum SportsNet as well as on champions -unite.org in August. During the event, an expert from SGH's Burr Heart & Lung Clinic shared information about the importance of lung cancer screening. In response to the COVID -19 pandemic and community need, the SGH Family Resource Center (FRC) was quickly created to facilitate and improve conne ction and support between family members and their hospitalized loved ones during times of restricted hospital visitation. Located in an exterior room of the hospital, the SGH FRC offers information about visitor restrictions, delivers belongings to patien ts on behalf of their families (e.g., discharge clothing, hearing aids, cell phones, eyeglasses, etc.) and arranges video calls for patients and visitors to check in with one another. The SGH FRC's service s were expanded in FY 2020 to include the new Disch arge Center, a comforting and relaxing space for discharged patients to wait for their transportation home. Approximately 760 patients have spent over 330 hours in the Discharge Center. In FY 2022, more th an 1,840 individuals dropped off belongings for pat ients at the hospital with COVID -19. Further, the SGH FRC has responded to thousands of phone calls and walk -ins seeking information and support. SGH helped increase awareness about current news and tren ds impacting the health and safety of community mem bers through television, printed news, digital news and radio outlets. Television interviews were given to KUSI News, 10News - ABC San Diego KGTV , NBC 7 San Diego, CBS News 8 - San Diego and KPBS. Printed and online articles appeared in the San Diego Busin ess Journal , The San Diego Union - Tribune , The Coronado Times, The Alpine Sun , The Star News and The East County Californian. Team members across SGH shared information through these outlets, including , but not limited to , the hospital's affiliated physicia ns in various specialties and staff from Sharp HospiceCare, Spiritual Care and administration . Topics included : Living with Long Covid, Breast Cancer Awareness Month, guidelines for aspirin use to prevent CVD , Go Red for Women on National Wear Red Day, par tnership with the ALA, and the return of SGH's 11 th Hour Program, among others . Numerous health -related articles were also shared through Sharp Health News and SGH's monthly e -newsletters. Throughout FY 2 022, staff at SGH regularly led or attended various health boards, committees, and advisory or work groups. Community and professional groups included San Diego Chapter of the AACN , ACS, AHA, ALA, Angels Foster Family Network, Association of Fundraising Pr ofessionals - San Diego Chapter, CAHHS, CAHHS Committee on Volunteer Services and Directors' Coordinating Council, California Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics - San Diego District, CHA Workforce Committee, CHA SDADVS, California Society fo r Clinical Soci al Work Professionals, Cameron Family YMCA, Concorde Career College - San Diego Program Advisory Committee, County of San Diego EMCC, County Service Area - 69 Advisory Board, Emergency Nurses Association - San Diego Chapter, Grossmont Colleg e Occupational Therapy Assistant Advisory Board, GHD, Health Sciences High and Middle College (HSHMC) Board, HASD&IC, INCP, John A.

Several organizations held meetings virtually due to the COVID -19 pandemic. FY 202 2 Plan SGH will do the following :162 Provide health and wellness education and services to community members at a variety of community events and sites Provide health and wellness education through local news sources Identified Community Need: Prevention of Unintentio nal Injuries Rationale references the findings of the SGH 2022 CHNA, HASD&IC 2022 CHNA or the most recent SDC community health statistics unless otherwise indicated. Rationale The HASD&IC and SGH 2022 CHNAs identified community safety as one of the priority health an d social needs affecting community members served by SGH. The HASD&IC and SGH 2022 CHNAs identified the following themes related to community safety in SDC: racism; violence and coercion; implications for high -risk ital workforce safety. HASD&IC 2022 CHNA community engagement participants emphasized the importance of a safe environment in which to live, exercise, or play. Concerns related to living in an unsafe neighborhood, include access to safe outdoo r spaces, as well as exposure to racism and bullying. These challenges impact people of all ages, but are of particular concern for children. In addition, clinicians and community -based organizations shared concerns about an increas e in safety risks for ch ildren, inclu ding some that have been exacerbated by the COVID -19 pandemic. Virtual learning in schools created fewer opportunities for mandated reporters to identify incidents of domestic violence and neglect, and children who were seen at hospitals seeme d to have mor e serious injuries. In 2020 , accidents (unintentional injuries) were the fifth leading cause of death for SDC's east region.149,150 Unintentional inju ries are one of the leading causes of death for SDC residents of all ages, regardless of gender, race or region. Unintention al injuries include the following: motor vehicle accidents, falls, pedestrian -related, firearms, fire/burns, drowning, explosions, p oisoning (including drugs and alcohol, gas, cleaners and Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 205 caustic substances), choking/suffocation, cutting/piercing, exposur e to electrical current/radiation/fire/smoke, natural disasters and workplace injuries. There were 255 deaths due to unintentional injury in SDC's east region in 2020 . The region's age -adjusted death rate due to unintentional injury was 44.2 deaths per 100,000 population, the highest of all regions in SDC. In 2019, there were 4,926 hospitalizations related to unintentional injury in S DC's east region. The age -adjusted rate of hospitalizations was 895.4 per 100,000 population, which was the highest of all S DC regions and significantly higher than the county age -adjusted rate of 650.9 per 100,000 population.152 In 2019, there were 31,011 ED visits rela ted to unintentional injury in SDC's east region. The age -adjusted rate for the east region was 6,286.3 per 100,000 population, which was the second highest of all regions and above the SDC age - adjusted rate of 5,122.0 ED visits per 100,000 population. According to the County of San Diego Department of the Medical Examiner 's 2021 Annual Report Executive Summary , more than half of sudden and unexpected deaths in SDC were attributed to accidental ca uses, including poisoning, falls, traffic - or train -related injuries, drowning, asphyxiation or environmental exposure. The number of deaths attributed to accidental causes increased 22.2% from 2020 to 2021 .201 According to Childhood Unintentional Injuries i n San Diego County: A report to the community , the COVID -19 pandemic has led to changes in the types of injuries that were most often experienced by children and youth. With stay -at-home orders, families were con fined to their homes and unintentional injur ies in the home, like window falls, led to hospital izations in greater numbers than expected. As families also spent more time outside, hospitals experienced an increase in all-terrain vehicle crashes and an unexpected increase in drownings \u2014 primarily in backyard pools.202 CDPH and California Department of Health Care Access and Information (HCAI )203 injury data indicates that, in 2020, unintentional injuries caused more than 1,500 deaths, nearly 130,000 million ED visits, and more than 27,500 hospitalizations in SDC . 142,204 In 2020 , unintentional injury was the fourth leading cause of death across all age groups in the U.S., accounting for nearly 201,000 deaths. Unintentional injury was the leading cause of death in the U.S. for people ages 1 to 44, the third leading cause of death for ages 45 to 64, and the eighth leading cause of death for those over the age of 65 .205 In 2020, more than 170,200 uninten tional injury deaths in the U.S. were attributed to three causes : poisoning ( 43.5%), motor vehicle traffic accidents ( 20.3%) and falls (21.0%). According to the Report Card on Children, Families, and Community, 2021 , more children die or are seriously hurt from injuries than from all childhood diseases combined, and ch ildhood injuries can result in long -term disabilities. They can be 201 County of San Diego Department of the Medical Examiner (2022), 2021 Annual Report Executive Summary . 202 Rady Children's Hospital San Diego (2022), Childhood Unintentional Injuries in San Die go County: A report to the community. 203 Califo rnia's Department of Health Care Access and Information was formerly known as the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development . 204 CDPH (2022), CDPH Vital Statistics Death Stat istical Master Files . 205 CDC , National Centers for Injury Prevention and Control Web -based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System (2022) .

The groups at greatest risk of childho od injury include children under one year old or older youth as well as Native American and rural children .186 According to the CDC, traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of death and disability in the U.S., contributing to about 32% of all injury deaths. Those who survive TBI can face effect s lasting a few days to disabilities that last the rest of their lives. Preventing older adult falls, improving safe play in sports , reducing firearm - related injuries, and increasing motor vehicle safety can reduce TBI. Public h ealth approaches to injury p revention can reduce the rate of TBI and its long -term consequences .206 In addition, in 2019, the economic cost of injury in the U.S. was $4.2 trillion, including $327 billion in medical care, $69 billion in work loss and $3.8 tri llion in value of statistic al life and quality of life losses. Economic cost was highest among working - age adults, highlighting that injuries during the most productive part of people's lives result in a high societal cost .207 Traumatic injury is the leadin g cause of death among chi ldren, with many survivors enduring the consequences of brain and spinal cord injuries (SCI). The physical, emotional, psychological and learning problems that affect injured children, along with the associated costs, make reducin g traumatic injuries a hig h priority for health and safety advocates throughout the nation. Educational programs like ThinkFirst increase knowledge and awareness of the causes and risk factors of brain and SCI, injury prevention measures, and the use of sa fety habits at an early ag e.208 Objectives Provide the ThinkFirst injury prevention program to children, adolescents and young adults in SDC's east region Provide presentations and opportunities to Health and Science Pipeline Initiative (HASPI) and San Di ego County Office of Education (SDCOE) high school students around injury and violence prevention and health care career readiness FY 2022 Report of Activities ThinkFirst San Diego (ThinkFirst) \u2014 a program led by Sharp Rehabilitation Services \u2014 is a chap ter of the ThinkFirst National Injury Prevention Foundation, a nonprofit organization dedicated to preventing brain, spinal cord and other traumatic injuries through education, research and advocacy. ThinkFirst includes specialized health care professional s as well as individu als known as Voices for Injury Prevention (VIPs) who have personally experienced traumatic injuries. At Sharp, VIPs help educate local youth about injury prevention by using their personal stories and explaining how making safer choice s could have prevente d the lifelong effects of a traumatic injury. 206 CDC, National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (2022), Get the Facts About TBI. 207 CDC Morbidity and Mort ality Weekly Report (2021). Economic Cost of Injury \u2014United States, 2019 . 208 ThinkFirst National Injury Prevention Foundation (2022), ThinkFirst For Kids! Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 207 In FY 2022, Sharp's ThinkFirst program offered numerous educational opportunities for community students. However, due to the continued impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on school s, most act ivities were conducted virtually. In total, ThinkFirst's injury prevention education reached 620 students in SDC's east region in FY 2022. This included more than 400 students in grades nine through 12 who are part of the HASPI and SDCOE programs. HASPI i s a network of educators, community organizations and he alth care industry representatives who collaborate to increase awareness of health and medical career opportunities, improve science proficiency in schools and prepare students for future health care careers. SDCOE provides a variety of educational, admini strative and other support services for schools throughout SDC. This includes a college and career readiness program to help students explore the world of work and build the skills necessary for a suc cessful career. Through these partnerships, in FY 2022, Sharp's ThinkFirst program offered both virtual education and in-person presentations to east region schools. The programs consisted of one - to two - hour classes on various topics including the modes o f injury (e.g., automobile collisions, violence and inju ries tied to sports/recreation); disability awareness; the anatomy and physiology of the brain and spinal cord; and career opportunities in physical rehabilitation. Classes were enhanced by powerful t estimonies from Sharp' s VIPs. Virtual presentations incl uded lengthy question -and-answer segments to strengthen the feeling of connectedness between the students and the VIP speakers. Students had the opportunity to ask questions by unmuting themselves or typing their questions into the chat box. Despite the vi rtual format, students showed greater engagement and participation compared to previous in -person presentations. In May, ThinkFirst delivered an in -person assembly to 220 students at Avocado Elementa ry School focused on TBI, SCI, disability awareness and the permanence of particular injuries. In addition, students received education about safety in the school parking lot and on the playground . Following the presentation, students engaged in hands -on learning and disability education through exploration of a wheelchair accessible van. This activity helped demonstrate to the children that people are more alike than different, regardless of physical ability. FY 2023 Plan ThinkFirst will do the following :209 Provide presentations to high school students on injury prevention, including career paths in physical rehabilitation Provide and expand educational program offerings to schools and organizations, including but not limited to SDC's east region Partner with schools to assess the need and provision of virtual injury prevention education Increase community awareness of ThinkFirst through attendance and participation in community health fairs and events 209 Where applicable, ThinkFirst will perform these activitie s as COVID -19 public health and safety guidelines allow. Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 208 Expand beyond the scope of HASPI with the SDCOE's Col lege and Career Readiness Department to provide education within the east region communities Grow partnership with the SDCOE's College and Career Readiness Department through participation in conferences, round table events and collaborative projects Provide booster seat education to elementary school children and their parents As appropriate, explore opportunities to incorporate concussion education into school and community -based presentations As requested, provide education to health care professiona ls and college students interested in health care careers Identified Community Need: Health Professions Education and Training, and Collaboration with Local Schools to Promote Interest and Career Pathways in Health Care Rationale references the findings of the SGH 2022 CHNA, HASD&IC 2022 CHNA or the most recent SDC community health statistics unless otherwise indicated. Rationale The HASD&IC 2022 CHNA identified workforce shortages as a foundational challenge that greatly exacerbates the priority healt h and social needs (access to health care, aging care & supp ort, behavioral health, children & youth well -being, chronic health conditions, community safety and economic stability) affecting community members served by SGH. Workforce shortages were describ ed by HASD&IC 2022 CHNA community engagement participants as the number one priority for local health care providers. The pandemic has severely strained the existing health care workforce, and staffing shortages have exacerbated challenges in meeting the d emand for community services. All health care settings, incl uding behavioral health, were described as understaffed, and workforce shortages can adversely impact the patient experience. Further, the workforce shortage is creating a wider equity gap, with f ewer culturally competent and linguistically appropriate pro viders available to care for SDC's diverse communities. The IPH Sharp Provider and Sharp Human Resources surveys conducted as part of the SGH 2022 CHNA process identified several educational topic s of particular interest and importance to employee professional development, including: defining cultural humility and applying it to health care; the impact of implicit or unconscious bias on decisio n-making; maternal and infant health with a focus on th e Black community; and health disparities among various groups, including the Black, Asian, Latinx and immigrant communities. Nearly 90% of IPH Sharp Provider Survey participants reported that COVID -19 had at least a moderate impact in employees' desire to change careers or leave the workforce, which may create challenges in meeting the health care needs of the community. Of thes e, the majority (78%) reported that Sharp does not have programs or services available to address this issue. Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 209 The San Diego Workfo rce Partnership (SDWP) reported that, in 2021, there were 186,000 people employed in the health care sector in SDC, accounting for 13% of all jobs countywide .210 SDWP also cites research by the University of Washington Center for Women's Welfare that estima tes the basic needs of a single adult resident of SDC to cost $3,058.72 per month, requiring full -time employment at $17.65 a n hour. Of the 20 most common occupations in SDC's health care sector, there are 11 with training requirements less than or equal t o an associate degree that can provide new graduates with a living wage .210 Total employment in California is projected to grow 16% between 2020 and 2030 , reflecting an increase of 2.8 million jobs statewide o ver the decade. The educational services (private), health care and social assistance sector is expected to be one of the fastest -growing industries in California, with 19.0% growth anticipated .211 According to the U.S. Bureau of La bor Statistics' Employment Projections - 2021- 2031 report, employment in health care and social assistance is projected to add about 2.6 million jobs from 202 1 to 203 1 \u2014 the highest growth among all industry sectors. Factors that are expected to contribute to this growth include ri sing demand for the care of an aging baby -boom population, longer life expectancies and higher prevalence of chronic conditions.212 According to a report from the California Health Care Foundation (CHCF ) titled California Physician s: A Portrait of Practice , the supplies of physicians, physician assistants and three types of advanced practice nurses in California grew between 2016 and 2020, while the supply of clinical nurse specialists decreased. The increased supply of licensed phy sicians does not accurately reflect the availability of care, however \u2014 less than half of California's physicians provided care 40 or more hours per week .213 According to a report titled Health Workforce Strategies for California, studies conducted over the past four decades demonstra te that multi -component pipeline programs for high school, college and post -baccalaureate students underrepresented in the health professions positively impact a variety of outcomes with the potential to improve the diversity of the health care workforce .214 Although California has enacted various policies to increase both the size and the diversity of the health workforce, current public and private sector efforts have not been sufficient to alleviate existing shortages .214 The California Future Health Workforce Commission (CFHWC) has described several recent state budget and policy actions intended to address the significant health and economic impacts of the COVID -19 pandemic. This includes investments in the mental health workforce, particularly for those who work with children and youth; investments in physician residencies, with an emphasis on psychiatry; additional HCAI oversight for state -supported health workforce programs; expanding 210 San Diego Workforce Partnership (2021), Expanding Access to Healthcare Jobs in San Diego County: Healthcare Sec tor Overview . 211 California Employment Development Department ( EDD) (2022), Employment Projections . 212 U.S. Bur eau of Labor Statistics (2022), Employment Projections - 2021 -2031 . 213 California Health Care Foundation (CHCF) (2021), California Physicians, 2021: A Portrait of Pract ice. 214 CHCF (2021), Health Workforce Strategies for California: A review of the Evidence . Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 210 the scope of practice for nurse practitioners; and creating several new reimbursable provider types, such as community health workers.215 According to CFHWC key informant interviews with private sector health care leaders, California's workforce needs include increasing workforc e diversity; educating young Californians that futures in the health sector are appealing regardless of background, socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity, and gender; and partnering with schools and companies to remove barriers to continuing education and d evelop pipelines for jobs .216 A CHCF survey of frontline health care workers during COVID -19 reflects the sustained mental and emotional t oll of providing patient care during the pandemic. Six in 10 providers continue to feel overworked and burned out, whil e nearly half are frustrated by their job. Nearly three out of four nurses (72%) say they feel burned out from their work \u2014 higher than t he 61% reported among nurse practitioners and physician assistants, 57% among doctors, and 56% among behavioral health specialists .217 Objectives Collaborate with local middle and high schools to provide opportunities for students to explore health care professions Collaborate with colleges and universities to provide internships and other professional development or caree r pathway opportunities to students Offer professional development opportunities for community health professionals FY 2022 Report of Activities In FY 2022, SGH collaborated with local, state and national schools, colleges and universities to provide hos pital-based opportunities for students to explore and train for a variety of careers in health care. Although still significant, in FY 2022, student participation in these programs declined as a result of temporary interruptions to on -site learning caused by COVID -19. Despite these circumstances, throughout the academic year, SGH provided more than 840 students from colleges and universities throughout SDC with various placement and professional development opportunities. More than 640 nursing students spen t over 50,200 hours at SGH, including time spent both in clinical rotations and individual preceptor training, while more than 170 ancillary (non - nursing) students spent more than 53,700 hours on the SGH campus. In addition, 25 advanced practi ce providers spent over 3,100 hours on the SGH campus. Academic partners included Azusa Pacific University (APU), California State University San Marcos, EMSTA, Grossmont College, Palomar College, Pima Medi cal Institute, PLNU, San Diego Mesa College, San Diego State Un iversity ( SDSU ), SWC , UC San Diego, UC San Diego Extension, University of San Diego, University of Southern California, University of St. Augustine for Health Sciences , West Coast University Lo s Angeles and Western Governors University. 215 California Future Health Workforce Commission (CFHWC) (2022), January 2022 Update on Health Workforce Progress . 216 CFHWC (2020), Meeting the Demand for Health: Top Priorities, Challenges, and Proposed Actions for the Private Sector to Support the Workforce California Needs . 217 CHCF (2021), COVID -19 Tracking Poll, May 2021 Views from C alifornia Health Care Providers on the Front Lines . Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 211 In addition, the SGH Cancer Center provided internships to two SDSU medical physics residents and a dosimetrist (an analytical member of the radiation oncology team) . SGH's cardiac team spent more than 1,000 ho urs mentoring over 50 students from APU, SDSU, UC San Diego, Gr ossmont College and PLNU, including students interested in a career as a nurse, emergency medical technician or cardiovascular technologist. Further, SGH continued to partner with Midwestern Un iversity in Glendale, Arizona , to provide physician -led mentors hip opportunities for medical students, serving 23 students in FY 2022. SGH's Pharmacy Department provided more than 9,000 hours of supervision, training, lectures and support to pharmacy stud ents in FY 202 2. The hospital invited 40 advanced pharmacy practice students to participate in rotations and provided over 4,000 hours of training to two post -graduate year one Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm.D.) residents . The Pharmacy Department also accepted their first resident into the newly created post-graduate year two ICU Pharm.D. system residency program. SGH pharmac y staff also had the opportunity to serve the community during ongoing challenges associat ed with the pandemic and other infectious disease outbreaks. During the mpox outbreak , pharmacists assisted wit h administering vaccinations at a community vaccine clinic . Pharmacy residents also supported pharmacy staffing needs for patient surges in the ICU and o ther inpatient floors. Additionally, t he Sharp Diabetes Education Program provided education to seve ral students throughout FY 2022 . In September, the Sharp Diabetes Education Program provided virtual diabetes education on the different types of diabetes, diagnoses, current technology and medication, community resources for patients, patient education modalities and careers in diabetes to more than 20 dietetic student s at SDSU. The Sharp Diabetes Education Program also mentored two dietetic interns from the San Diego WIC Dietetic Internship program. The director of the Sharp Diabetes Education Program ser ved as a board member of the San Diego WIC Dietetic Internship pr ogram in FY 202 2 and provided a presentation on diabetes care, the role of the dietitian, the different types of diabetes, nutrition and meal planning, diabetes and technology and more to all six interns in the program. In September, the program director p articipated in a career panel discussing careers in dietetics, including outpatient diabetes care, to approximately 50 dietetics students at the California Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Career Fair at PLNU . During the panel's question -and-answer sessi on, attendees were able to ask questions about panelists' experiences in the field of dietetics . After a pause due to the COVID -19 pandemic, SGH resumed its participation in the HSHMC progra m and safely welcomed back students in September. More than 30 10 th to 12 th grade HSHMC students were on SGH's campus for approximately 440 hours. Students rotated through instructional pods in specialty areas, including but not limited to nursing; emergen cy services; maternal Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 212 FRC ; and operations. In collaboration with Cajon Valley Union School District, in May, SGH continued to introduce middle schoolers to a variety of possible health care careers during World of Work week \u2014 a K-12 curriculum that exposes students to both self - and ca reer exploration to help maximize future education and employment. During the event, SGH team members \u2014 a physical therapist and a pulmonary manage r \u2014 provided students with two live presentations via an online platform to support distance -learning needs. Presentations highlighted daily hospital operations; favorite and most challenging aspects of different jobs; required education and training; care er advice, including how students can immediately begin preparation for select hospital jobs ; and more. In addition, the presenters answered questions to help students discover career paths that align ed with their interests and strengths. SGH continued t o collaborate with the Grossmont Union High School District (GUHSD) in the Health care Exploration Summer Inst itute (HESI), providing high school students with a virtual learning experience where they can explore and gain exposure to health care careers in the hospital. Three eight -week internship programs were held in FY 2022. Each week, SGH health care professio nals met with approximately 40 students through a live, virtual platform to discuss their educa tional and career paths, as well as their roles and experiences at SGH. Topics included an introduction to SGH and hospital careers, ambulatory care, the element s and operations of the ED, infectious disease and prevention, laboratory, pharmacy, SGH's Comp rehensive Stroke Center, SGHWN and speech therapy. Upon completion of the program, students received high school credits for an elective course. In December, th e SGH Burr Heart & Lung Clinic and the ALA - San Diego collaborated to share lung health inform ation at the GUHSD Parent Awareness Night. Representatives shared tips on how parents can speak with their teens about smoking, as well as answer ed questions abo ut SGH's pulmonary services. SGH and ALA - San Diego also shared resources at the event. In add ition, SGH's behavioral health team provided teen mental health resources and answered questions at the event. In June, SGH joined Heartland Fire at their train ing facility in El Cajon for an event to raise awareness about men 's health issues . At the event, the San Diego County Board of Supervisors chair and a representative of the s upervisor in District 2 attended , along with other elected officials, and issued a proclamation declaring June to be Men 's Health Month in SDC . The event included activities that encouraged approximately 50 firefighters to take control of their health and maintain healthy habits. In addition, a Shar p-affiliated family medicine physicia n provided men's health education as well as connected with participants and answer ed questions. At the Planetree International Conference on Person -Centered Care in Anaheim, California, the SGH Manager of Volunteer S ervices shared a poster on Sharp Heal thCare's Community COVID -19 Vaccination Program and Superstation logistics. Held in May, the three -day conference focused on the topics of Restoring Ourselves; Rebuilding Trust & Engagement; and Creating a Healthier, Fa irer, More Caring World. Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 213 Attendees we re educated on the power of organizational culture to support compassionate care, dynamic teamwork, patient and family engagement, resilience during crisis and best practices that help care teams , across the continuum o f care , address the full range of pat ient and family needs and preferences. The conference also included educational sessions, keynote speakers, opportunities to connect with the Planetree community and much more. In addition, SGH, certified by Planetree for excellence in person -centered care , hosted nearly 25 hospital leaders from all over the world who attended the conference. SGH staff shared information about its Planetree designation and provided leaders with a tour of the hospital. In March, SGH hosted a tour for the chair of the San D iego County Board of Supervisors, who visited with front line health care workers and thank ed staff for their ongoing effort to care for the community throughout the pandemic. Also in FY 202 2, SGH provided a tour of the hospital to a staff-member from the Washington D.C. -based office of a local congressional representative. FY 202 3 Plan SGH will do the following:162 In collaboration with GUHSD, participate in HESI Participate in the HSHMC program Provide in ternship and professional development opportunities to college and university students throughou t SDC Collaborate with local universities to provide professional development lectures for students Provide internships to SDSU medical physics residents Provid e an internship module for exercise physiology and kinesiology students Offer HealthCare Towne, an outreach program and field trip to the SGH campus for middle and junior high school students Explore the reinstatement of the I Inspire program, a wee klong program that encourages high school students from underrepresented backgrounds to consider careers in health care Identified Community Need: Access to Health Care , Community and Social Support Rationale references the findings of the SGH 2022 CHNA, HASD& IC 2022 CHNA or the most recent SDC community health statistics unless otherwise indicated. Rationale The HASD&IC and SGH 2022 CHNAs identified access to health care and economic stability among the top community needs affecting members of the communiti es served by SGH, particularly underserved and underfunded patients who face inequities. Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 214 The HASD&IC and SGH 2022 CHNA s identified the following themes related to accessing health care in SDC : overall barriers to care; the impact of telehealth; health lite racy; transportation; health insurance and financial concerns; stigma; the needs of specific populations (LGBTQ+, people experiencing homelessness, individuals at the end of life, undocumented individuals, and parents or caregivers); the need for trauma -informed care; and workforce challenges. HASD&IC 2022 CHNA participants also described the following logistical challenges related to accessing health care: makin g primary care appointments or accessing their usual source of care; insurance restrictions and confusion; a need for referrals to access certain services or treatments; finding the right fit with a provider; and timeliness related to level of care, such a s locating after -hours urgent care. Nearly all (99%) IPH Sharp Provider Survey participants rep orted COVID -19 had a n impact on patients' access to transportation , which may result in decreased access to health care. Strategies to address this included inc reasing community awareness about shuttle access or Sharp Van Services and providing telehealth. According to the HASD&IC 2022 CHNA, financial concerns may deter patients from accessing health care. Financial assistance to help pay for medical bills was described as a frequent and significant need. Community members are not always aware of low or no -cost programs that may be available to help pay for services. According to the HASD&IC 2022 CHNA, t he lack of post -acute services has created long wait times for appropriate level s of care, especially following discharge from the hospital. Hospital staff are significantly challenged in finding timely follow -up care or a safe place to discharge people with compl ex behavioral health needs. These longstanding challenges became even worse during the pandemic. In addition, limited availability of long-term care beds was identified as the leading deficit in the post-acute care continuum . An analysis of ICD -10 (Interna tional Classification of Diseases - 10th Revision) codes indicates that, in FY 2022 , a total of 771 inpatients at SGH \u2014 a 35.4% decrease compared to FY 2021 . In addition, a total of 345 SGH inpatients had an ICD -10 diagnosis for pr oblems related to living alone in FY 2022 . In 2021, 11.0% of east region adults, teens and children reported having no usual source of health care. In addition, 18.8% of east region residents reported that they had not visited a doctor at all in the previous year .148 According to the San Diego Hunger Coalition, while nutrition insecurity has declined since 2021, high rates still remain due to long -standing economic disparities that were exacerbated by the COVID -19 pandemic . As of March 2022 , more than 1 in 4 San Diegans experienced nutrition insecurity, with disproportionate impacts noted among communitie s of color .145 As of September 2022 , the average unemployment rate in the east region cities of El Cajon, La Mesa, Lakeside, Lemon Grove, Santee and Spring Valley was 3.5%. This is the same as the national rat e, but higher than the rate for SDC overall ( 3.1%) and lower than the state of California (3.8%), during the same period.218 According to the San Diego Regional Task Force on Homelessness' 2022 Point -in- Time Count, there was a 3% increase in SDC's unsheltere d homeless population in 218 California EDD (2022), Labor Market Information . Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 215 from 2020 to 2022. In 2022 , 20% of SDC's homeless population resided in the east region.219 In 2020, 1 in 4 unsheltered SDC residents were adults ages 55 and over. Among the region's unsheltered seniors, 88% became homeless in SDC an d 43% reported experiencing homelessness for the first time in their lives.220 Nationwide, the population of individuals ages 65 and older experiencing homelessness is expected to nearly triple over the next decade \u2014 from 40,000 in 2020 to approximately 106,000 by 2030.221 According to findings from CHC F's 2022 California Health Policy Survey, half of Californians (49%) reported taking at least one action to delay, skip, or cut back on care in the past 12 mont hs because of concerns related to cost. Of those who delayed care due to cost, 47% reported that their health condition worsened.222 According to the same survey, more than 1 in 4 lower -income Californians (30%) reported that it was \"somewhat\" or \"very\" dif ficult to find a provider who took their insurance, c ompared to 12% of Californians with higher incomes .222 In addition, among Californians with lower incomes, 4 in 10 reported being very worried about affording unexpected medical bills (42%), out -of-pocket cost s (39%), rent or mortgage (41%), and transportation costs (40%).222 Objectives Connect vulnerable un- and under -insured patients to community resources and organizations that provide sliding scale223 post-acute medical appointments and reduced cost medication s Connect individuals experiencing SUD s to community treatment Provide transportation and medication assistance for individuals with financial barriers Provide vaccinations on -site and at various sites thro ughout SDC Collaborate with community organizations to provide services to people experiencing chronic homelessness Provide clothing and shoes to patients in need upon discharge from the hospital Through the CTI program, provide vulnerable, un - and under -funded patie nts with health coaching, support and resources to address health equity barriers and ensure a safe transition from hospital to home and continued health and safety FY 202 2 Report of Activities SGH provides supportive programs that address a variety of social determinants of health ( SDOH ) \u2014 the conditions under which people live, learn, work and play \u2014 impacting seniors and community members with health equity barriers , including access to health care , healthy food , transportation and other ba sic needs . 219 San Diego Regional Taskforce on Homelessness (2022), San Diego County WeAllCount Point -in-Time Count . 220 Serving Seniors (2021), Senior Homelessness: A Needs Assessment . 221 University of Pennsylvania (2019), The Emerging Crisis of Aged Homelessness: Could Housing Solutions Be Funded by Avoidance of Excess Shelter, Hospital, and Nursing Home Costs? 222 CHCF (2022), The 2022 CHCF California Health Policy Survey . 223 An income -based fee structure where individuals with fewer financial resources pay a lower fee. Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 216 In FY 202 2, SGH continued to facilitate post -acute care services for vulnerable patients, including individuals who experience homelessness or lack financial resources or insurance coverage. SGH also facilitated temporary stays in independent l iving facilities and referred individuals to community organizations to assist with food, safe shelter and transportation. Throughout the COVID -19 pandemic, SGH referred several COVID -19- positive patients to county -operated, temporary isolatio n hotels. Pat ients experiencing homelessness were referred to a shelter when appropriate. Through the Discharge with Dignity program, SGH Volunteer Services provides weather -appropriate clothing and shoes to patients in need, including those experiencing homelessness, patients transferring to skilled nursing facilities ( SNF) or patients who lack nearby friends or family upon discharge from the hospital. The majority of these supplies come from the hospital auxiliary's Thrift Korral, a resale boutique locat ed in downtow n La Mesa. In partnership with GHD , SGH hosted a community drive -thru clothing drive in October , which collected more than 4,500 articles of clothing and shoes for the hospital's patients in need. In FY 202 2, more than 7,200 articles of clothing and shoes were provided to units throughout the hospital, including the ED and Behavioral Health Services Department. In addition, SGH provides medically necessary DME to vulnerable, un - or under -insured patients upon discharge. In FY 2 022, this included standard wh eelchairs, front wheel walkers, canes , portable oxygen, oximeters (a device that measures blood oxygen levels ), pediatric nebulizers (a machine used to deliver asthma medicine deep inside the lungs) and cardiac life vests. New in FY 2022, S GH, along with all Sharp acute care hospitals, joined the Bridge Medication -Assisted Treatment (MAT) program, which serves ED patients with opioid use disorder and mental health concerns. The California Bridge Grant was awarded to SGH and Sh arp Memorial Hospital (SMH) , and in April 2022, the program was extended throughout the system. The goal is to better identify patients in need of MAT in Sharp EDs and to bridge their connection to treatment in the community. This program involves collabor ation among a variety of profe ssionals, including social workers, clinical informatics, ED nurses and Sharp -affiliated emergency medicine physicians. Sharp established assessment and referral pathways for those with opioid use disorders, as well as screene d patients for need and desire of MAT, with the ability to receive the first dose of suboxone in the ED, a prescription for up to 14 days, Narcan ( a life -saving medication that can reverse an overdose from opioids) , and an appointment with a community clinic for ongoing MAT. Sharp part nered with a community organization, Comprehensive Treatment Centers, for prioritized access to treatment upon discharge from the ED. In addition, SGH's ED began distributing Narcan, free of charge, to any reques ting community member. To assist individual s who lack financial resources, SGH provided more than $ 185,500 in free medication, transportation, lodging and financial assistance through its Project HELP funds. These funds assisted more than 1 0,900 individua ls in FY 202 2. Further, Sharp's Patient Acce ss Services (PAS) team provides robust services to assist with access to care and health insurance coverage for patients at all Sharp hospitals, Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 217 including SGH. Please refer to Secti on 1 (Overview): Patient Access to Care Prog rams for more information on these programs and services. Throughout the COVID -19 pandemic, Sharp has provided lifesaving vaccines to residents in convenient, safe and local se ttings. From May 2021 through June 2022 , Sharp , led by SGH, partnered with loc al schools, employers, churches, community events, multiple cruise lines , private organizations, San Diego Zoo , SeaWorld, as well as six events with National Night Out \u2014 a national community -building campaign that promotes police -community partnerships \u2014 to increase access to, and promote awareness of , COVID -19 vacc ines. Recognizing the challenges community members faced with scheduling and transportation, t he Sharp mobile vaccination team \u2014 a dedicated group of vaccinators, pharmacists and documentation experts \u2014 traveled by van t hroughout SDC , provid ing COVID -19 vaccines and information to the community as well as answering any questions. In total, Sharp administered 20,763 doses of t he COVID -19 vaccine at 187 mobile pop -up events in FY 2022 . In addition, SGH continued to provide community COVID -19 vaccinations at the SGH Care Clinic . In May 2021, SGH launched the Grossmont Homebound Vaccine program to help ensure health equity for pa tients with mobility challenges. Homebound patients were ident ified by Sharp health care professionals, as well as through a list generated by County of San Diego P ublic Health Services . Sharp contacted the patient or caregiver and scheduled a home visit a ppointment with a Sharp RN or licensed vocational nurse, who t raveled to the patient's home to administer the vaccines. Once vaccinated, patients were monitored for up to 30 minutes in case of adverse reactions. Since its inception , approximately 1,150 vac cines were administered through the homebound vaccination prog ram. From August 2022 through October 2022, Sharp, led by SGH, was the first health system in San Diego to host mpox vaccination events, which were open to all eligible, higher -risk individuals in the community at no cost. Sharp administered over 1,000 vaccines through these events. Beginning in 2014, SGH piloted the CTI program for its most vulnerable patient populat ions, including but not limited to un - and under -insured patients. As communi ty needs and vulnerabilities change (e.g., COVID -19), CTI adjusts its medical criteria and collaborates with other hospital departments and the community to meet those changing needs. The CTI program is modeled after the countywide Community -based Care Transitions Program (CCTP) established by CMS to serve the Medicare fee -for-service patient population at risk for readmission. CCTP concluded several years ago, but its success insp ired the development of SGH's CTI program. The CTI program uses a comprehen sive risk assessment tool to identify vulnerable patients, who are offered 30 days of coaching by an RN or medical social worker at no cost. The assessment tool evaluates patients for multiple factors including isolation, co - occurring health issues, food i nsecurity, behavioral health issues and other conditions that impact their health and safety. Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 218 The CTI program includes a collaborative team of SGH and other Sharp professionals, including nurses, pharmacists, case managers, social workers and disease spe cialists, as well as team members from community benefit, PAS, the SGH Senior Resource Center and others. CTI health coaches include an RN and a medical social worker who devote h undreds of hours directly to enrolled patients. The CTI health coaches also collaborate with disease specialists to ensure consistent communication with and instructions for patients regarding their care plans, and disease -specific (e.g., CHF, COPD and dia betes) tools to help them maintain their health. In addition, the CTI health coaches ensure that upon discharge, vulnerable patients connect with a PCP, as well as the community resources and support they need to safely transition home and remain safe and healthy in the community. Partnerships with community organizations connect t hese patients to critical social services post -discharge, and have included Feeding San Diego ( FSD), San Diego Food Bank (Food Bank ), 2-1-1, FHCSD, various churches and refugee an d other social support organizations. This outreach is critical to sustain th e health and well -being of patients who may face significant hardships and empower them to manage their care outside the hospital. Food insecurity is a key factor in the health s tatus of CTI patients. Since its inception, thousands of CTI patients have be en identified as food insecure and provided a direct referral to 2 -1-1. 2-1-1 then reaches out to CTI patients to connect them to resources , such as federal assistance food commodity programs (through the Food Bank), free food distribution sites throughout San Diego and assistance with CalFresh \u2014 federally known as SNAP \u2014 enrollment. In addition, t he CTI program works closely with SGH's PAS team to evaluate patients for CalFresh benefits prior to hospital discharge, which dramatically increased the likeliho od that patients completed their applications and received benefits. Further, with funding f rom the Grossmont Hospital Foundation, the CTI program provides medically tailored emergency food bags for CTI patients who lack sufficient food at home. The food bags include nutritious items selected with guidance from an SGH dietitian to address the uni que nutritional needs of CTI patients, ensuring their health until they are connected to food assistance. The food bags provide CTI patients with nonperishable, n utrient-dense foods during the first few days of discharge, when proper nutrition is critical. CTI health coaches provide food bags during their home visits and combine this delivery with a review of the patient's hospitalization and plan for self - manageme nt. Since inception, the CTI program has provided hundreds of food bags to CTI patients in SDC 's east region. A significant number of CTI patients live with diabetes and face challenge s with adhering to their care plan due to the cost of diabetes medicati on and equipment. To address this barrier, SGH's Transition of Care pharmacist orders and fills diabetes medication prescriptions and ensures they are provided to CTI patients upon discharge. In addition, CTI health coaches provide food -insecure CTI patien ts with diabetic -friendly, heart -healthy groceries, as well as educational materials and logs to document their blood -sugar levels. Further, the health coaches reinforce the education given by SGH Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 219 Diabetes Educators, who provide these patients with \"diabet es kits\" \u2014 including a limited supply of testing strips, lancets, glucose monitors and other n eeded supplies. These kits help CTI patients manage their health and remain safe until their insurance is activated. In addition, the CTI health coaches provide p atients with other supplies, including blood pressure cuffs, pill boxes, pill splitters and ca n openers \u2014 the latter being a key resource for patients experiencing homelessness. Year after year, the CTI program has demonstrated powerful metrics of improve d patient health and well -being, as well as reduced unnecessary health care utilization. To date, the CTI team has successfully enrolled nearly 4,200 individuals in the program. Among its most impressive metrics, the CTI program has dramatically reduced readmission rates for participants. Since the inception of the pr ogram, the overall readmission rate for CTI patients is 5.7%. In FY 202 2, the average readmission rate for CTI patients was 7.7%. These figures are a substantial decrease from the average readm ission rate of 25 -30% for those patients who qualify for CTI bu t who do not enroll in the program. The focus on both coordinated care management and health equity barriers contributes to the success of the CTI program. Beginning in FY 2019, SGH joined Sha rp's systemwide pilot partnership with 2 -1-1's CIE to better understand and address the health equity barriers that influence the health and well -being of their patients. SGH joined the CIE pilot partnership to provide more informed, holistic ca re to patie nts facing health equity challenges and to connect them directly to community resources to meet those needs. Nearly 130 CIE community partners \u2014 including health care organizations, the County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency , hous ing network s, food banks and other social service agencies \u2014 use an integrated technology platform to support proactive, holistic, person -centered care. Shared records enable CIE partners to evaluate an individual's SDOH needs and histor y of community serv ices utilization and to make direct referrals to critical, community -based resources. SGH case managers and social workers were trained on CIE to better serve patients in the acute care setting, including patients who experience homelessness, food insecurity and othe r hardships. Although d elays and obstacles to CIE implementation and adoption persisted due to the COVID -19 pandemic during Year 3 of the CIE pilot, utilization metrics were sustained after demonstrating growth between Years 1 and 2 . Community members acr oss SDC were assisted through the CIE , including East County residents in El Cajon, Lakeside and La Mesa . The top community referrals provided to patients through the CIE included utilities, food, housin g and economic support .

Community engagement helps people align the care they receive with their preferences, values and beliefs. \u2014 Suzi Johnson, Vice President of Advanced Illness, Palliative and Hospice Care Fiscal Year (FY) 2022 Community Benefit Program Highlights Sharp HospiceCare provides programs and services to all of Sharp HealthCare's (Sharp) hospital entities. However, Sharp HospiceCare is licensed under Sharp Grossmont Hospital (SGH) and, as such, the financial value of its community benefit programs and services are included in Section 6 of this report. The following descriptio n highlights various programs and services provided by Sharp HospiceCare to San Diego County (SDC) in FY 2022 in the following Senate Bill 697 community benefit categories: Other Benefits for Vulnerable Populations included education and support for seniors on advance care pla nning (ACP), advanced illness management (AIM) and other end -of-life topics , and the provision of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19) vaccines to homebound community members. Other Benefits for the Broader Community included a varie ty of end -of-life and AIM support for families, caregivers and veterans throughout SDC, such as education, support groups and outreach at community health fairs and events. In addition, Sharp HospiceCare staff actively participated in community boards, committees and civic organ izations, including the San Diego County Coalition for Improving End -of-Life Care (SDCCEOLC), Caregiver Coalition of San Diego (Caregiver Coalition), San Diego County Hospice Veteran Partnership (San Diego County HVP), California Hos pice and Palliative Car e Association (CHAPCA) , East County Senior Service Providers (ECSSP), California Health Care Foundation's (CHCF) Physician Orders for Life -Sustaining Treatment (POLST) eRegistry Implementation Committee, and San Diego County Medical Society (SDCMS) Bioethi cs Commission. See Appendix A for a list of Sharp's involvement in community organizations in FY 2022. The category also includes costs associated with community benefit planning and administration, including community health needs assessment (CHNA) development and participation. Health Research, Education and Training Programs included time devoted to education and training for community health care professionals and students. Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 224 Definition of Community Sharp HospiceCare is lo cated at 8881 Fletcher Parkway in La Mesa, ZIP code 91942. Sharp HospiceCare provides comprehensive en d-of-life hospice care, specialized palliative care and compassionate support to patients and families throughout SDC. See Appendix B for a map of community and region boundaries in SDC. For Sharp's 2022 CHNA process, the Dignity Health/IBM Watson Health Community Need Index (CNI) was used to identify communities within its service area that experience greater health inequitie s.227,228 The CNI uses demographic and economic statistics to provide a \"CNI score\" for every populated ZIP code in the U.S. CNI scores measure inequity on a scale ranging from very low health inequity to very high health inequity. This measurement is an avera ge de termined through an analysis of specific socioeconomic barriers to health care access, including education, income, culture/language, insurance and housing. As such, the CNI demonstrates the link between community need, access to care and preventable hospi talizations. According to the CNI, communities served by Sharp HospiceCare with especially high need include a number of communities in SDC's south, central and east regions.227 Figure 19 presents a map of the CNI findings across SDC. 227 Dignity Health and IBM Watson Health Community Need Index ( CNI) (2022). The Dignity Health and IBM Watson CNI was discontinued on January 31, 2023 . 228 According to the World Health Organization ( WHO ), health inequities are di fferences in health status or in the distribution of health resources between different population groups arising from the social conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work and age. These inequities have significant social and economic costs bot h to individuals and societies (WHO, 2018). Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 225 Figure 19: CNI Map \u2014 SDC229 Description of Community Health In 2022, there were 525,919 residents ages 65 and older in SDC, representing 15.8% of the population. Between 2022 and 2027, it is anticipa ted that SDC's senior population will grow by 14.1%.230 In 2020, 10.9% of the SDC population reported living below 100% of the federal poverty level (FPL). The county's unemployment rate was 5.9% and 5.1% of households received Supplemental Security Income.231 229 Truven Health Analytics, 2022; Insurance Coverage Estimates, 2022; Nielson Company, 2022; and CNI, 2022. 230 SpeedTrack\u00a9, Inc.; U .S.

Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 226 According to the San Diego Hunger Coalition, while nutrition insecurity232 has declined since 2021, high rates remain due to long -standing economic disparities that were exacerbated by the COVID -19 pandemic . As of March 2022, 28% of San Diegans experience d nutrition insecurity and 35% of children lived in nutrition -insecure households.233 In 2020, 7.1% of households in SDC received Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, while 16.7% of the population lived at or below 138% FPL and were e ligible for the program.231 Please refer to Table 33 for SNAP participation and eligibility in SDC.

Each Sharp acute care hospital, including Sha rp Chula Vista Medical Center (SCVMC), Sharp Coronado Hospital and Healthcare Center, SGH and SMH , completed 2022 Sharp's 2022 CHNA was significantly influenced by the collaborative Hospital Association of San Diego and I mperial Counties (HASD&IC) 2022 CHNA process and findings. Please refer to Section 3: Community Benefit Planning Process for a detailed description of Sharp's process and findings. Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 229 In addition, this year, each hospita l completed its most current implementation strategy \u2014 a description of programs designed to address the priority health needs identified in the 2022 CHNAs. The most recent CHNA and implementation strategies are available at http://www.sharp.com/about/community/health -needs -assessments.cfm . Through the Sharp 2022 CHNA process, the following priority health needs were identified for the communit ies served by Sharp HospiceCare (listed in alphabetical order): Access to Health Care Aging Care & Support Behavioral Health Children & Youth Well -being Chronic Health Conditions Community Safety Economic Stability The following pages detail Sharp HospiceCare programs, activities and services that specifically address these needs, either directly or indirectly. Please refer to Section 1 (Overview): Patient Access to Care Programs for additional entity and systemwide programs designed to address access to health care. Sharp HospiceCare's community programs and services feature a special focus on aging concerns, including provision of: End-of-life and AIM education for community members ACP education and outreach for community members, students and he alth care professionals Hospice and palliative care education and training programs for students and health care professionals Bereavement counseling and support For each priority community need identified above, subsequent pages include a summary of t he rationale and importance of the n eed, objective(s), FY 2022 Report of Activities conducted in support of the objective(s) and FY 2023 Plan. Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 230 Identified Community Need: End -of-Life and AIM Education for Community Members Rationale references the findings of Sharp's 2022 CHNAs, HASD&IC 2022 CHNA or the most recent SDC community health statistics unless otherwise indicated. Rationale The HASD&I C and Sharp 2022 CHNAs identified issues that affect care and support during the aging process as a prio rity health and social need affecting the community members served by Sharp. The HASD&IC and Sharp 2022 CHNAs identified the following themes related to aging care and support in SDC: economic stability and risk of homelessness; social isolation; access to health care; access to community resources and support; behavioral health; stigma; and other health and safety concerns. HASD&IC interviewees shared that it is difficult to find palliative care programs offering culturally diverse services, which can be particularly challenging for community members who are LGBTQ+ , veterans and people of color. Participants in the Institute for Public Health's ( IPH) Sharp Provider Survey conducted as part of Sharp's 2022 CHNAs identified caregivers of adults or older adul ts as the leading population of patients impacted by COVID -19 in relation to increased isolation in seniors/older adults, i ncreased anxiety and depression, and decreased access to behavioral health care. In 2019, the top 10 leading causes of death among ad ults ages 65 and older in SDC were (in rank order): diseases of the heart, cancer, Alzheimer's disease, cerebrovascular dis eases (including stroke), chronic lower respiratory diseases, diabetes, accidents/unintentional injuries, essential hypertension and hypertensive renal disease, Parkinson's disease, and influenza or pneumonia. In 2019, hospitalization rates among seniors i n SDC were higher than the general population due to coronary heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, nonfatal unintentional injuries (including falls), diabetes and cancer. In a 2019 survey on long -term and end -of-life care in Califo rnia, 65% of respondents reported that their loved ones would have preferred to die at home, while only 39% were able to do so.239 Approximately 1.72 million Medicare beneficiaries who died were enrolled in hospice care for one day or more in 2020, a 6.8% increase from 2019.240 The Caregiving in the U.S. 2020 report estimates that 16.8% (41.8 million) of Americans care for an adult age 50 and older, an increase from 14.3% in 2015. Caregiving prevalence has increased among all racial/ethnic groups, educationa l levels, work statuses, genders, and nearly all generations.241 While many caregivers rely on health care professionals (such as doctors , nurses or social workers) as a source of information about providing care (55%), very few 239 California Health Care Foundation ( CHCF ) (2020), Long -Term and End -of-Life Care in California: Is California Meeting the Need? 240 National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization (NHPCO) (2022), NHPCO Facts and Figures Report, 2022 Edi tion. 241 National Alliance for Caregiving (NAC) (2020), Caregiving in the U.S. 2020. Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 231 report having conversations about what they need to care for their recipient (29%) or to sup port their own well -being (13%).241 In 2020, caregivers reported that their care recipient had an average of 1.7 comorbid conditions, an increase f rom 1.5 conditions in 2015. This increase suggests that not only are more American adults taking on the role of unpaid caregiver, but t hey are doing so for adult recipients with increasingly complex medical or support needs.241 According to a report titled Burning the Candle at Both Ends: Sandwich Generation Caregiving in the U.S. , sandwich ca regivers \u2014 those who provide unpaid care to an adult while also caring for children in their home \u2014 account for 28% of all caregivers. Sandwich caregivers often juggle work and caregiving responsibilities, and report high levels of emotional stress and phy sical or financial strain.242 According to AARP's report, Home Alone Revisited , nearly one -third of caregivers (30.9%) take their family member home from the hospital without home health support. Almost half of family caregivers provide intense and complex c are, including performing medical/nursing tasks and manag ing multiple health conditions often accompanied by pain. In addition, nearly half of caregivers who perform medical/nursing tasks reported feeling down, depressed or hopeless, compared to a third of caregivers who do not perform those tasks.243 In 2021, 11.3 million caregivers of people with Alzheimer's disease or other dementias in the U.S. provided 16 billion hours of unpaid assistance \u2014 a contribution valued at $271.6 billion, of which California ca regivers account for approximately 10%. Further, as symptoms worsen, the care required by family members can result in increased caregiver stress and depression, new or exacerbated health problems and depleted income and finances.244 According to the Nationa l Institute on Aging, the four areas of end -of-life care include: providing physical comfort; managing mental and emotional needs; supporting spiritual needs; and providing support for practical tasks.245 According to a study on palliative care savings, adul t home -based palliative care programs reduced medical expenses by 16.7% during a calendar year compared with those who received usual care. Despite savings among members with commercial insurance and Medicare, those with Medicaid did not show savings.246 In 2020, 83.4% of U.S. hospitals with 50 or more beds had a palliative care program compared to 24.5% in 2000. Despite this growth, barriers in access to palliative care remain, including variability of palliative care programs by geography, hospital size and tax status, and limited staff and resources. The next phase of growth will require more palliative care in the community \u2014 in nursing homes, office practices and patients' homes.247 242 NAC (2019), Burning the Candle at Both Ends: Sandwich Generation Caregiving in the U.S. 243 AARP (2019 ), Home Alone Revisited: Family Caregivers Providing Complex Care. 244 Alzheimer's Association (2022), 2022 Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figures . 245 National Institute o n Aging (2021), Providing Care and Comfort at the End of Life . 246 Gordon, M.J., Le, T., Lee, E.W., & Gao, A.

In FY 2022, activities were conducted both in -person and virtually based on the most current COVID -19 safety guidelines and served nearly 1,000 members of the community. Team members shared information about hospice and palliative care with more than 200 individuals at community -sponsored health fairs and events. This included the Spring Into Healthy Living senior health fair a t the McGrat h Family YMCA in Rancho San Diego in March as well as the St . Paul's PACE ( Program of All -Inclusive Care for the Elderly ) El Cajon Fan Drive & Networking Event in June \u2014 an annual event that collects donated fan s to help seniors beat the summer heat. In addition, in October , Sharp HospiceCare partnered with the County of San Diego's Aging & Independence Services, the City of Chula Vista and other community organizations to host Life is A Song. Held at Norman Park Senior Center in Chula Vista, th e interactive event for seniors featured music therapy services from MusicWorx Inc. as well as community resource tables. Sharp HospiceCare also participated in Sharp -sponsored community events in FY 2022. During the annual Sharp Women's Health Conference in May, team members provided approximately 300 attendees with five -minute mind -clearing exercises, healing touch sessions, and information about hospice, palliative care and ACP. In September, Sharp HospiceCare shared info rmation and resources about hosp ice and palliative care at the Sharp HealthCare Aging Conference: Experience the Spectrum of Care at the La Mesa Community Center. Held in collaboration with the SGH Senior Resource Center, the free event provided approximat ely 100 community seniors and ca regivers with education and resources to support healthy aging, including exhibitor tables, a panel discussion and an exercise session. In addition, Sharp HospiceCare engaged 65 community members in presentations on underst anding hospice and palliative ca re. Presentations were provided to residents of Covenant Living at Mount Miguel in October as well as to members of San Diego Oasis \u2014 a continuing education program for older adults \u2014 in La Mesa in April. Further, Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 233 throughout the year Sharp HospiceCare staf f provided phone -based education to approximately 300 community members seeking general information about hospice and palliative care. Sharp HospiceCare supports the needs of military veterans and their families through collaboration with local and nation al organizations that advocate for quality end -of-life care for veterans; the provision of veteran -oriented community education and events; and participation in activities that honor veterans for their service. Sharp Hospic eCare is a member of the San Die go County HVP. Through the partnership, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) San Diego Health System and San Diego's community hospice organizations collaborate to promote quality care for veterans with a life -limiting illness and serve as a voice and resource for veterans and their families. Sharp HospiceCare is also a partner of We Honor Veterans (WHV) \u2014 a national program developed by the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization (NHPCO) in collaboration with the VA to empower hospice p rofessionals to meet the unique end - of-life needs of veterans and their families. As a WHV partner, hospice organizations can achieve up to five levels of commitment. Sharp HospiceCare has pursued and achieved WHV Partner Le vels I -IV. Through Level I, Shar p HospiceCare is equipped to provide veteran -centric education to staff, volunteers and community professionals, including training them to identify patients with military experience. Level II indicates that Sharp HospiceCar e has built the organizational c apacity needed to provide quality care for veterans and their families. At Level III, Sharp HospiceCare has developed and strengthened relationships with VA medical centers and other veteran organizations, and at Level IV, t he organization has achieved imp roved access to and quality of care for community veterans. Sharp HospiceCare participated in several veteran -oriented community events and recognition activities in FY 2022. I n March, team members provided planning support as well as event set -up and cle an-up efforts for the Vietnam War Veterans Day Welcome Home Ceremony at the Veterans Association of North County in Oceanside. Sharp HospiceCare also honored veterans through special pinning ceremonies, during which veterans received a WHV pin and a certif icate of appreciation for their service. In recognition of Veterans Day in November, volunteers provided pinning ceremonies for more than 60 Sharp HospiceCare patients. Sharp HospiceCare also participated in pinning ceremoni es for approximately 130 veteran s at locations throughout SDC in FY 2022, including St. Paul's Plaza retirement community in Chula Vista; the annual Veterans Day Dance in collaboration with County of San Diego Parks and Recreation; and Westmont of La Mesa senior living's Memorial Day cel ebration, for which Sharp HospiceCare also helped secure an event speaker and singer. In further support of Westmont of La Mesa senior living, in FY 2022 Sharp HospiceCare continued to sponsor the facility's Veterans Honor W all by arranging photography ser vices and framing veterans' photos. In March, Sharp HospiceCare team members added 12 veterans' photos to the honorary wall. Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 234 In FY 2022, Sharp HospiceCare continued to support Honor Flight San Diego \u2014 a nonprofit team of vo lunteers dedicated to escorting local veterans to Washington D.C. to visit and reflect at memorials dedicated to their service and sacrifice. In August, this included Honor Flight San Diego's annual Spirit of '45 celebration, which gathered approximately 2 00 World War II and Korean War v eterans at San Diego's Marina Village Conference Center to commemorate the official end to World War II. In September, this included participation in fundraising activities for Honor Flight San Diego during Force -Con 2022, a three -day military convention a nd art festival hosted by the San Diego Air and Space Museum. Sharp HospiceCare continued to provide a wig donation program in FY 2022. Through the program, Sharp HospiceCare receives new, unused wigs from manufacturers, wh ich are cleaned, styled and dona ted to individuals experiencing hair loss as a result of treatment for cancer or other illnesses. During private appointments, team members help community members select their wig and provide personalized fitting, styling an d maintenance instructions. Shar p HospiceCare donated 15 wigs to community members in FY 2022. Beginning in 2021, Sharp HospiceCare coordinated with 2 -1-1 San Diego to identify, register and provide COVID -19 vaccinations to homebound individuals in the community. Sharp HospiceCare serv ed more than 2,000 of SDC's most vulnerable residents through this effort, which ended in early 2022 . FY 2023 Plan Sharp HospiceCare will do the following:248 Collaborate with community organizations to provide end -of-life and AIM education and resources to community members Support the needs of military veterans and their families through the provision of education and resources and collaboration with local an d national organizations advocating for quality end -of-life care for veterans Maintain WHV Partn er Level IV to improve access to and quality of care for community veterans Provide a wig donation program for community members experiencing hair loss followin g treatment for cancer or other illnesses 248 Where applicable, Sharp HospiceCare will perfo rm these activities as COVID -19 public health and safety guidelines allow. Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 235 Identified Com munity Need: ACP Education and Ou treach to Community Members Rationale references the findings of Sharp's 2022 CHNAs, HASD&IC 2022 CHNA or the most recent SDC community health statistics unless otherwise indicated. Rationale The HASD&IC and Sharp 2022 CHNAs identified issues that affect care and support during the aging process as a priority health and social need affecting the community members served by Sharp. According to the Institute for Healthcare Improvement, respectful end -of-life care is concordant with patients' stated goals, values and preferences. Goal -concordant care is pursued through ACP, which strives to ensure that patients and surrogate medical decision maker s understand the diagnosis, prognosis and treatment options, and that health care professionals understand what m atters most to their patients. ACP also involves shared decision -making to ensure that health care professionals make care recommendations that are sensitive to what matters most to patients, and that patients and surrogates always have the opportunity to make informed care decisions.249 When properly conducted, the benefits of ACP include better quality of life, care that is more consistent with patient preferences, and improved bereavement outcomes for the family. Research indicates that people do not exper ience increased depression, anx iety or hopelessness as a result of such conversations. Even if attempts to engage patients in the ACP process do not always lead to specific decisions, they may be an important way of building trust and relationships among patients, families and health ca re professionals, and may also be helpful for making future decisions.250 Research suggests that rates of ACP are particularly low (20%) among racial/ethnic minority populations and those with limited health literacy. Dispariti es persist among LGBTQ+ commun ities, individuals experiencing homelessness and incarcerated populations. ACP can be complicated by lack of trust and negatively impacted by experiential racism in health care.251 Research suggests that the barriers family care givers faced during the COVID -19 pandemic limited their engagement with ACP. Challenges included: interruption of pre-established care plans that created limitations for future care planning; caregivers being forced to focus on the present during the pande mic; and lack of knowledge of the importance of ACP and being engaged in the decision -making process. Themes identified as enablers of ACP included providing specific education and tools to guide caregivers through the ACP process, with an emphasis on the 249 Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) (2019), How Do you Measure Respect? 250 IHI (2019), \"Conversation Ready\": A Framework for Improving End -of-Life Care (Second of Advance Care Planning Outcomes: What Do We Know and Where Do We Go?

This discordance resulted in patients receiving potentially unwa nted aggressive medical treatments, including CPR ( cardiopulmonary resuscitation ), surgery and intubation. Quality of communication between surrogates and health providers resulted in higher concordance with identified care preferences.253 Additional resear ch on end -of-life intensive care unit (ICU) utilization found that more than one -third of patients with treatment -limiting POLSTs received potentially unwanted intensive care near the end of life. Research on ICU patients and survivors suggests that patien ts receiving aggressive life -sustaining treatments experience a high burden of unr elieved physical symptoms and emotional distress.254 In a survey of physicians caring for older adults, 99% agreed that ACP discussions are important, but obstacles often ge t in the way. This includes concerns the conversation might be uncomfortable , not w anting the patient to lose hope , and uncertainty about what is culturally appropriate. Strategies to foster a meaningful, patient -first dialogue in which the person feels sa fe and supported include: giving the moment the space it deserves; considering the cultural context; and reflecting and recapping based on the patient's body language and tone of voice.255 Analysis of a web -based ACP platform shows a five -fold increase in t he completion of online advance health care directives (advance directives) since th e onset of the COVID -19 pandemic. Advance directives in the COVID -19 period were also completed in more depth compared to the pre -COVID -19 period, with users completing a g reater number of optional goal -setting modules on the website. Strict hospital visit ation restrictions may have increased the perceived importance of advance directives to communicate care preferences.256 Among ICU personnel, moral distress can result from the use of ongoing life -support for a patient who the team believed did not prefer th is course of care, but whose family requested it. Strategies recommended to reduce stress and allow meaningful action include improving the consistency of care plans and e ducating family members and ICU personnel about ACP and Mickens, M. (2021).

Through the program, the Sharp ACP department \u2014 consisting of Sharp HospiceCare team members with specialized training in ACP \u2014 empowers adults of any age and health status to explore and document their beliefs, values and goals as they relate to health care. The program consists of three stages. Stage one, community engagement, focuses on bringing awareness to healthy commun ity m embers about the importance of ACP. This stage includes basic education and resources, identification of an appropriate health care agent and completion of an advance directive. Stage two, disease -specific outreach, focuses on education for community membe rs with a progressive chronic illness, including decline in functional status, co -morbidities, potential for hospitalization and caregiver issues. With a goal of anticipating future needs as health declines, this stage focuses on developing a written plan that identifies goals of care and involves the health care agent and loved ones. The third stage, late -life illness outreach, targets those with a disease prognosis of one year or less. Under these circumstances, individuals must make specific or urge nt de cisions, and these decisions require conversion to medical orders that will guide the health care provider's actions and remain consistent with goals of care. The focus of this stage is to assist the individual or appointed health care agent with navi gatin g complex medical decisions related to immediate life -sustaining or prolonging measures. Such measures include completion of the POLST form, a medical order designed for individuals with advanced progressive or terminal illness that identifies the app ropriate informed substitute decision maker as well as describes preferences for care and treatment when important health care decisions must be made. Since 2014, Sharp has offered the Advance Health Care Directive: A Guide for Outlining Your Health Care Choic es. This form is publicly available on sharp.com in both English and Spanish and uses easy -to-read language to describe what an advance directive is, as well as how and why to complete one. The form allows individuals to put their health care wishes i nto w riting and appropriately sign the advance directive. With this witnessed signature, the advance directive becomes a legal document that identifies the 258 Nguyen, A.L., Davtya n, M., Taylor, J., Christensen, C., & Brown, B.

Additional contact information is provided for community members who are interested in speaking with a Sharp HospiceCare ACP team member. Further, through sharp.com, Sharp provides access to PREPARE for Your Care \u2014 a free online ACP platform from the Rege nts o f the University of California (UC) . PREPARE for Your Care provides community members with ACP resources in an easy -to-understand manner in both English and Spanish, including educational videos and a guided, step - by-step advance directive template. In FY 2022, Sharp 's ACP department provided free consultations to nearly 150 community members seeking guidance with identifying their personal goals of care and health care preferences, appointing an appropriate health care agent and completing an advance directive. Consultations took place in -person and by phone, as well as virtually to support social distancing during the COVID -19 pandemic. Further, in FY 2022, team members provided ACP and spiritual care support for seven palliative care patients in the comm unity. Appointments were provided at patients' homes at no cost in collaboration with an SGH -affiliated family medicine and palliative care doctor. Opportunities for community engagement and education continued to be impacted by the COVID -19 pandemic in FY 2022. Despite these challenges, Sharp's ACP department provided both in -person and virtual ACP presentations throughout the year, helping approximately 70 community members identify their personal health care choices, select a trusted and qualified subst itute health care decision maker, communicate their wishes to loved ones, and document their goals of care. In -person presentations were provided to members of the San Diego Death Talk Meetup group in November; the SGH Patient and Family Advisory Coun cil in December; the women's auxiliary at Alpine Community Church and residents of Casa de Ma\u00f1ana Retirement Center in May; and residents of Covenant Living at Mount Miguel in July. In addition, an ACP webinar was provided to the community in partnership w ith the Cancer Centers of Sharp in October, and as part of the Dr. William C. Herrick Community Health Care Library's Wellness Wednesday program in March. Sharp's ACP department also provided educational materials and resources to approximately 120 commu nity members at health fairs and events in collaboration with the Grossmont Healthcare District (GHD). In April, team members participated in Planting Now for the Journey Ahead at the GHD in honor of National Healthcare Decisions Day \u2014 a nationwide initiat ive to educate adults of all ages about the importance of ACP. The free event taught participants how to carefully select a substitute medical decision maker; understand and complete their advance directive; and ensure their wishes for care and treatment a re un derstood. That same month, Sharp's ACP department hosted a resource table at the GHD's Health Fair Saturday event at Grossmont Center. In September, the team joined the SGH Senior Resource Center, SGH Rehabilitation Services and SMH Trauma Services for the Fall Prevention & Balance Screening event at the GHD. Further, ACP information and resources were shared with approximately 375 attendees of Sharp -sponsored community events, Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 239 including the annual Sharp Women's Health Conference in May and the annual Sharp HealthCare Aging Conference in September. In FY 2022, Sharp's ACP department continued to participate in the state -wide initiative to create an electronic POLST registry (POLST eRegistry). When a paper POLST form is not readily available during an emerg ency, a patient's care may be hindered or conflict with their wishes. Funded by the CHCF and supported by the Coalition for Compassionate Care of California and California Emergency Medical Services Authority, the POLST eRegistry improves provider acc ess t o critical information through a cloud -based registry for completed POLST forms to be securely submitted and retrieved. In March 2017, Sharp became the first health care system in SDC to begin electronic uploads of patient POLST forms to the POLST eRe gistry. FY 2023 Plan Sharp HospiceCare will do the following:248 Provide free ACP consultations to community members Collaborate with community organizations to provide educational classes and events that ra ise community awareness of ACP Participate in community events to promote the importance of ACP in honor of Nation al Healthcare Decisions Day Provide information to community members regarding the End of Life Option Act (EOLOA) as requested Participate in the state -wide POLST eRegistry initiative Update Sharp's advance directive document to improve readability, enhan ce documentation of health care preferences, and increase online form use Identified Community Need: Health Professions and Student Educati on and Training Rationale references the findings of Sharp's 2022 CHNA, HASD&IC 2022 CHNA or the most recent SDC community health statistics unless otherwise indicated. Rationale The HASD&IC 2022 CHNA identified workforce shortages as a foundational challenge that greatly exacerbates the priority health and social needs (access to health care, aging care & support, behavioral health, children & youth well -being, chronic health conditions, community safety and economic stability) affecting community membe rs served by Sharp. Workforce shortages were described by HASD&IC 2022 CHNA community engagement partic ipants as the number one priority for local health care providers. The pandemic has severely strained the existing health care workforce, and staffing shortages have exacerbated challenges in meeting the demand for community services. All health care setti ngs, including behavioral health, were described as Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 240 understaffed, and workforce shortages can adversely impact the patient experience. Further, the workf orce shortage is creating a wider equity gap, with fewer culturally competent and linguistically approp riate providers available to care for SDC's diverse communities. Total employment in California is projected to grow 16% between 2020 and 2030, reflectin g an increase of 2.8 million jobs statewide over the decade. The educational services (private), health care and social assistance sector is expected to be one of the fastest -growing industries in California, with 19.0% growth anticipated.259 According to th e U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' Employment Projections - 2021 - 2031 report, employment in health car e and social assistance is projected to add about 2.6 million jobs from 2021 to 2031 \u2014 the highest growth among all industry sectors. Factors that are exp ected to contribute to this growth include rising demand for the care of an aging baby -boom population , longer life expectancies and higher prevalence of chronic conditions.260 According to a report titled Health Workforce Strategies for California, studies conducted over the past four decades demonstrate that multi -component pipeline programs for high scho ol, college and post -baccalaureate students underrepresented in the health professions positively impact a variety of outcomes with the potential to improv e the diversity of the health care workforce.261 Although California has enacted various policies to increase both the size and the diversity of the health workforce, current public and private sector efforts have not been sufficient to alleviate existing s hortages.261 The direct care workforce, which includes personal care aides, home health aides and nursing assistants, is expanding rapidly as the U.S. population grows older, people live longer with disabiliti es and chronic condition s, and the supply of potential family caregivers dwindles. The long -term care sector has expanded from 3 million workers in 2009 to almost 4.6 million in 2019 and is expected to add a further 1.3 million direct care jobs by 2028.262 The demand for geriatri cians is projected to increase 45% by 2025 with a projected national shortage of almost 27,000 geriatricians.263 In addition, almost half of U.S. physicians experience burnout, which has been connected to lower patient satisfaction, ov eruse of resources, higher costs of care, increased chance of prescribing the wrong medications, lower levels of empathy, and reduced patient outcome and safety.263 The American Academy of Hospice and Palliativ e Medicine notes that lack of provider training and knowledge of palliative care results in many patients with serious illness receiving painful or ineffective treatments that do not prolong or enhance their lives. Expanding hospice and palliative care tra ining opportunities can help ensure that clinicians across disciplines and specialties who care for people with serious illness are competent in \"basic palliative care,\" including communication skills, interprofessional collaboration and symptom manageme nt.264 259 California Employment Development Department (2022), Employment Projections . 260 U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (2022), Employment Projections - 2021 -2031 . 261 CHCF (2021) , Health Workforce Strategies for California: A review of the Evidence . 262 PHI (2021), Caring for the future: The Power an d Potential of America's Direct Care Workforce . 263 Flaherty, E. and Bartels, S.J.

Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 241 An analysis published in the journal Health Affairs estimates that there is currently one palliative care physician for every 808 eligible patients. To meet current demand for patient evaluation, each physician would need to perform 10 patient visits pe r day over 48 weeks per year. Assuming no policy chang es, by 2038, it is estimated that each physician would need to perform 23 patient visits per day to meet demand, highlighting the need to increase the use of interdisciplinary palliative care team membe rs in the assessment and management of patient and car egiver distress.265 Additional research published in Health Affairs suggests six vital strategies that can help improve the care and quality of life for all older Americans, including creating an adequate ly prepared workforce, strengthening the role of publ ic health, remediation of disparities and inequities, developing new approaches to care delivery, allocating resources to palliative and end -of-life care, and redesigning long -term services and supports.266 A study on the end -of-life priorities of terminall y ill older adults and their caregivers identified seven major themes: quality of life as a priority; maintaining a sense of control; how to manage putting life on hold during a loved one's life -limiting illness; challenges in navigating the health system; preference for remaining at home as long as possible; a need for open and honest discussions about death; and the importance of a consultative, patient -centered care approach by health professionals .267 Objectives Provide education and training opportunities around end -of-life care and ACP for students and interns Provide education and training to health care organizations to guide the development and implementation of AIM and other services for the aging community Maintain active relationships and leadership roles with local, state and national organizations FY 2022 Report of Activities In FY 2022, Sharp HospiceCare collaborated with local and state universities to provide student learning opportunities in the hos pice setting. During the year, three students \u2014 including a nursing, an advanced practice provider, and an ancillary student \u2014 received approximately 825 hours of mentorship from Sharp HospiceCare staff. Academic institution partners included Azu sa Pacific University (APU), UC San Diego and West Coast University Los Angeles. Sharp HospiceCare supports San Diego's current and future health care workforce through lectures to enhance understanding of hospice and palliative care. Throughout 265 Kamal, A. H., Wolf, S.

In addition, in April, the team provided a virtual presentati on on ACP and POLST to 15 Master of Social Work employees at Kaiser Permanente Hospice in Sacramento. In FY 2022, Sharp HospiceCare partnered with San Diego Coalition for Compassionate Care to provide monthly education and training on POLST to a pproximate ly 75 community health professionals and students. This included clinicians from local skilled nursing facilities, including Sharp facilities, as well as students from California State University San Marcos and San Diego State University (SDSU). These web -based seminars helped develop and enhance participants' skills for facilitating meaningful conversations with patients and families about their care goals. Between June and August, Sharp HospiceCare collaborated with a professor from SDSU and o ther ACP f acilitators in SDC to discuss and plan ways to effectively bring ACP education, resources and support to San Diego's Latinx community. As a member of the San Diego County HVP and WHV, Sharp HospiceCare supported the planning and delivery of a w ebinar series for community health professionals who work with veteran patients. Titled Trauma -Informed Care and Service -Connected Diseases, Illnesses and Conditions, the free series provided education regarding post - traumatic stress, moral injury, suicida l ideation, and how diseases, illnesses and conditions related to one's military service impact aging veterans and those receiving hospice care. Approximately 180 professionals from both local and out -of-state hospice and health care organizations particip ated in the training. Sharp HospiceCare provided support for the series in various ways, including technical support, event promotion, content development, securing presenters and more. Sharp HospiceCa re participated on several local, state and national c ommunity boards and committees dedicated to hospice, palliative and end -of-life care, ACP, and the needs of seniors. This included, but was not limited to, the Caregiver Coalition, ECSSP, San Diego Coun ty HVP, and SDCCEOLC. In ad dition, Sharp HospiceCare leadership continued to serve on the board of directors for CHAPCA \u2014 a California -based not -for-profit organization providing education and advocacy to improve access to qualit y end -of-life care. FY 2023 Plan Sharp HospiceCare will do the following:248 Provide lectures on hospice and palliative care to nursing, anci llary and medical students Provide students with an end -of-life learning environment Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 243 Provide education, training and o utreach to local, state and national organizations to support the development and implementation of specialized services to meet the needs of the aging population Provide education and outreach on ACP, POLST and EOLOA to local, state and national health ca re professionals Maintain active relationships and leadership roles with local and national organizations Identified Community Need: Ber eavement Counseling and Support Rationale references the findings of Sharp's 2022 CHNAs, HASD&IC 2022 CHNA or the most recent SDC community health statistics unless otherwise indicated. Rationale A study on the end -of-life priorities of terminally ill older adults and their caregivers identified seven major themes: quality of life as a priority; maintaining a sense of control; how to manage putting life on hold during a loved one's life -limiting illness; challenges in navigating the healt h system; preference for remaining at home as long as possible; a need for open and honest discussions about death; and the importance o f a consultative, patient -centered care approach by health professionals .268 Counseling or grief support for the patient and loved ones is an essential part of hospice care. After the patient's death, bereavement support is offered to families for at least o ne year. These services can take a variety of forms, including visits, written materials about grieving, phone or video calls, and support groups. Individual counseling may be offered by a hospice, or a hospice may make a referral to a community resource. Some hospices also provide bereavement services to the community at large, in addition to supporting patients and their families.269 According to the NHPCO, grief can happen when a death occurs or in response to other significant losses (e.g., divorce, job l oss, declining health or mobility, etc.). Experiencing grief is one of the ways that individuals heal and adjust to li fe after loss. Bereaved individuals may need additional support, particularly if they are unable to get on with the normal tasks of life o r are behaving in ways that might be harmful.270 A study on the predictors of complicated grief in caregivers of palliative care patients established a direct relationship between factors prior to bereavement and complicated grief. This included the intensit y of anticipated grief; previous mental and physical health of the caregiver; social support; quality of patien t care; communication at the end of life; preparation for death; spirituality; and sociodemographic factors.271 268 Lewis, E.T., Harrison, R., Hanly, L., et al.

OMEGA - Journal of Death and Dying, 0(0). https://doi.org/10.1177/00302228221133437 Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 244 In a study on how location at death influences caregiver well -being in bereavement, participants who reported some type of location incongruence demonstrated higher levels of distress, including more days of being physically and emotionally unwell and more intense bereavement symptoms. Cong ruence between a dying person's preferred and actual locations at death is considered good care. Discussing preferences about the place of end -stage care may not make location congruence possible, but it can foster shared understanding and support for care givers' sense of coherence and well -being in bereavement.272 Among those with serious medical conditions and th e elderly, the need for caregiving encompasses nearly 51 million Americans. Much of this demand is satisfied through uncompensated care. In 2021, t he direct economic impact of caregiving was estimated at nearly $44 billion through more than 650,000 jobs lo st and nearly 800,000 caregivers experiencing absenteeism issues at work. However, the indirect effect that deteriorating caregiver health has on e conomic outcomes is more substantial. The overall economic impact of caregiving across the direct and indirec t channels is estimated at $264 billion.273 In the development and aftermath of the COVID -19 pandemic, it is anticipated that worldwide, prolonged g rief will become a major public health concern. Recent studies indicate that between 47% and 71% of family c aregivers report grief while caring for a loved one and 20% experience complicated grief after death. Even though most persons have not had COVID -19, society has experienced a collective grief due to the efforts to contain the spread of the virus, as well as complexities associated with funeral and memorial services.274 Deaths due to COVID -19 are associated with risk factors which can lead to prolonge d grief disorder, post -traumatic stress and other poor bereavement outcomes among relatives. Risk factors i nclude dying in an ICU, severe breathlessness, patient isolation or restricted access, significant patient and family emotional distress, and disrupt ion to relatives ' social support networks.275 The same study recommends the following strategies for reducin g the risk of complicated grief during the COVID -19 pandemic: ACP; proactive, sensitive and regular communication with family members alongside accura te information provision; enabling family members to say goodbye in person where possible; supporting virt ual communication; providing excellent symptom management and emotional and spiritual support; and providing and/or signposting to bereavement service s.275 272 Waldrop, D. & McGinley, J.

Services include professional bereavement counseling for individuals and families as well as free community education, support groups and monthly newsletter mai lings. In FY 2022, activities were conducted either virtually or in -person based on the most current COVID -19 guidelines. In FY 2022, Sharp HospiceCare's licensed clinical therapists with specific training in grief and loss devoted 170 hours to bereavemen t counseling with individuals and families who lost loved ones. Sessions took place in the Sharp HospiceCare office, client homes and by phone, as well as virtually to support social distancing during the COVID -19 pandemic. Referrals to community counselor s, behavioral health services, bereavement support services and other community resources \u2014 including those related to COVID -19 \u2014 were also provided as needed. Sharp HospiceCare continued to provide the Healing After Loss virtual grief education group in FY 2022. Offered in both spring and fall, the eight -week series included the following sessions: Introduction to the Grief Process; Communicating with Family and Friends; Strategies for Coping with Grief; Mind -body Tools for Grief; Dea ling with Challengin g Emotions in Grief; Guilt, Regret and Forgiveness; Use of Ceremony and Ritual to Promote Healing; and Who Am I Now?/What Does Healing Look Like? In FY 2022, Sharp HospiceCare's Healing After Loss group served 22 members of the community. In addition, Shar p HospiceCare offered the eight -week Widows' and Widowers' counseling group four times throughout the year. Serving 26 community members in FY 2022, the group addressed the concerns of individuals who were grievi ng the loss of a spouse, including sharing e motional challenges and exchanging coping skills with others in similar circumstances. New in FY 2022, Sharp HospiceCare offered two, four -week in -person spiritual care groups. Provided in the spring, A Movemen t Toward Wholeness helped participants conne ct to their spirituality and how it both helps and hinders them; develop a tenderness toward and awareness of their soul; and explore the ways they might interact with spirituality along their grief journey. Held in the summer, A Movement Toward Forgivenes s supported peace and reconciliation between participants and those who have passed on, including how spirituality can help with forgiveness. Together, A Movement Toward Wholeness and A Movement Toward Forgivenes s served 12 individuals. Also new, Sharp Ho spiceCare provided two in -person, interactive workshops in FY 2022: Facilitating Closure and Helping Children Cope With Grief. Held over four Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 246 sessions during the summer, Facilitating Closure was specifically desi gned for the bereaved who have passed the on e-year anniversary of their loved one's death; have actively processed the depths of grief; and are moving into the phase of integrating the loss into their life and moving forward. Serving five participants, the group emphasized the positive aspects of he aling from grief and learning to live with the loved one as a memory. Provided in July, the single -session Helping Children Cope With Grief workshop was developed for adults whose children have experienced the de ath of a loved one. The psychoeducational gr oup discussed various components of childhood grief, including dimensions of grief response in children; factors that influence the grief of children; reconciling the needs of childhood mourning; and exploring th e special needs of grieving adolescents. The workshop supported four parents and included opportunities to share family experiences and ask questions. In October and March, a Sharp HospiceCare music therapist led a new, in -person Coping With Grief Through Music workshop. Designed for adults experie ncing loss and seeking gentle, supportive ways to navigate their grief, the classes taught five participants techniques for using music to be present, memorialize their loved one and express feelings in a non -judgmental setting. Further, Sharp HospiceCare supported more than 20 individuals grieving the loss of a loved one during the 2021 holiday season at its virtual Healing Through the Holidays event in November Sharp HospiceCare also continued to mail its month ly bereavement support newsletter, Healing T hrough Grief , to community members for 13 months following the loss of their loved one. Up to 1,700 newsletters were mailed each month during FY 2022.

Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 251 Figure 2 1: Percentage of Community Benefit by SB 697 Category Sharp Mary Birch Hospital for Women & Newborns \u2014 FY 202 2 Key highlights: Medical Care Services included uncompensated care for patients who were unable to pay for services and unreimbursed costs of public programs, such as Medi -Cal, Medicare and CHAMPVA/TRICARE.284 In FY 2020, the State of California and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services approved a Medi -Cal Hospital Fee Program for the time perio d of July 1, 2019, through December 31, 2021 , and in FY 2022 the same agencies approved another Medi -Cal Hospital Fee Program for the time period of January 1, 2022 through De cember 31, 2022. This resulted in recognition of net supplemental revenues for SM BHWN totaling $ 16.3 million in FY 2022. This reimbursement helped offset prior years' unreimbursed medical care services; however, the additional funds recorded in FY 2022 understate the true unreimbursed medical care services performed for the past fiscal year. Other Benefits for Vulnerable Populations included financial assistance for van transportation for patients to and from medical appointments, the Sharp Humanitarian S ervice Program and other assistance for vulnerable community members. 284 The Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs (CHAMPVA) is a health benefits program in which the Department of Veterans Affairs shares the cost of certain health care services and supplies with e ligible beneficiaries. TRICARE is a health care program of the U.S. Department of Defense Military Health System , which provides civilian health benefits for U.S Armed Forces military personnel, military retirees, and their dependents, including some membe rs of the Reserve Component.

SMBHWN staff actively participated in community boards, committee s and other civic organizations, such as the American Heart Association (AHA), The Doris A. Howell Foundation for Women's Health Research (Howell Foundation); Council of Women's and Infants' Specialty Hospitals (CWISH), Health Sciences High and Middle Coll ege (HSHMC), Perinatal Social Work Cluster, Pima Medical Institute, Southern California Association of Neonatal Nurses (SCANN) and YWCA San Diego County . See Appendix A for a list of Sharp' s involvement in community organizations in FY 2022. This category also includes costs associated with planning and operating community benefit programs, such as community health n eeds assessment (CHNA) development and participation . Health Research, Educ ation and Training Programs included time devoted to education and training for health care professionals, student and intern supervision, and generalizable health -related research projects that were made available to the broader health care community. Definition of Community SMBHWN is located at 3003 Health Center Drive in San Diego, ZIP code 92123. As a specialty hospital, SMBHWN serves all of San Diego County (SDC); however, the primary communities served by the hospital include the City of San Diego, Chula Vista, the east region and the north inland communities surrounding Rancho Bernardo. See Appendix B for a map of community and region boundari es. For Sharp Memorial Hospital's (SMH) 2022 CHNA process (which included the processes and findings addressing needs identified for communities served by SMBHWN) , the Dignity Healt h/IBM Watson Health Community Need Index (CNI) was used to identify commun ities within its service area that experience greater health inequities .285,286 The CNI uses demographic and economic statistics to provide a \"CNI score\" for every populated ZIP code in the U.S. CNI scores measure inequity on a scale ranging from very low heal th inequity to very high health inequity. This measurement is an average determined through an analysis of specific socio -economic barriers to health care access, including education, income, culture/language, insurance , and housing. As such, the CNI demon strates the link between community need, access to care and preventable hospitaliza tions. According to the CNI, communities served by SMBHWN with especially high need 285 Dignity Health and IBM Watson Health Community Need Index ( CNI) (2022). The Dignity Health and IBM Watson CNI was discontinued on January 31, 2023. 286 According to the World Health Organization ( WHO ), health inequities are dif ferences in health status or in the distribution of health resources between different population groups arising from the social conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work and age. These inequities have significant social and economic costs both to individuals and societies (W HO, 2018). Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 253 include a number of communities in SDC's south, central and east regions .285 Figure 22 presents a map of the CNI findings across SDC. Figure 22: CNI Map \u2014 SDC287 Description of Community Health In 2022 , there were 594,086 women ages 18 to 44 residing in SDC, representing 17.8% of the populati on.

Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 257 Community Benefit Planning Process In addition to the steps outlined in Section 3: Community Benefit Planning Process regarding community benefit planning, SMBHWN: Incorporates community priorities and community relations into its strategic plan and develops service line -specific goals Estima tes an annual budget for community programs and services based on commu nity needs, the previous years' experience and current funding levels Participates in programs and workgroups to review and implement services that improve the health status and emotio nal well -being of women and infants Priority Community Needs Addresse d in Community Benefit Report \u2014 SMH 2022 CHNA SMH completed SMH's 2022 CHNA was significantly influenced by the collaborative Hospital Associati on of San Diego and Imperial Counties (HASD&IC) 2022 CHNA process and findings. Please refer to Section 3: Community Benefit Planning Process for a detailed description of Sharp's CHNA process and findings. In accorda nce with federal regulations, the SMH 2022 CHNA also includes needs identified for communities served by SMBHWN, as the two hospitals share a license, and report all utilization and financial data as a single entity to the California Department of Health C are Access and Information. In addition, this year SMH updated its implementation strategy \u2014 a description of programs designed to address the priority health and social needs identified in the 2022 CHNA. Again, in alignment with federal regulations, the SMH implementation strategy includes programs and services provided by SMBHWN. Through the SMH 2022 CHNA, the following priority health and social needs were identified for the communities served by SMH and SMBHWN (listed in alphabetical order): Acces s to Health Care Aging Care & Support Behavioral Health Children & Youth Well -being Chronic Health Conditions Community Safety Economic Stability Maternal & Prenatal Health , including High -Risk Pregnancy Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 258 SMBHWN is a specialty hospital providing care for e xpectant mothers and newborns as well as women's services. Therefore, in alignment with these identified needs, the following pages detail programs that specifically address maternal and prenatal care, including high -risk pregnancy, along with associated p riority health and social need s. Please refer to Section 1 (Overview): Patient Access to Care Programs for additional entity and systemwide programs designed to address access to health care. As a specialty hospital, SMBH WN lacks the resources to comprehensively address the elements of community education and support for all identified needs. Consequently, the programs and services that address the other needs are provided through SMH. Please refer to Section 10 of this report for details on those programs. The community education and support elements of behavioral health (including substance use) are addressed through the programs and services provided thr ough Sharp Mesa Vista Hospital and Sharp McDonald Center, which are the major providers of behavioral health and substance use treatment services in SDC. Please refer to Section 11 of this report for details on those programs. For additional details on SMBHWN program s that specifically address the needs identified in the 2022 CHNA, please refer to SMH's implementation strategy . The most recent SMH CHNA and implementation strategy are available at http://www.sharp.com/about/community/health - needs -assessments.cfm . For each priority comm unity need identified above, subsequent pages include a summary of the rationale and importance of the need, objective(s), FY 2022 Report of Activities condu cted in support of the objective(s) and FY 2023 Plan. Identified Community Need: Maternal and Prenatal Care, Including High -Risk Pregnancy Rationale references the findings of the SMH 2022 CHNA, HASD&IC 2022 CHNA or the most recent SDC community health statistics unless otherwise indicated. Rationale The SMH 2022 CHNA identified maternal and prenatal care, including high -risk pregnancy, as one of the priority health and social needs affecting the community members served by SMH. Within this need, the f ollowing themes were identified: declini ng fertility trends; maternal and infant health; infant mortality; high -risk pregnancy; and behavioral health. Participants in the Institute for Public Health's ( IPH) Sharp Provider Survey conducted as part of the SM H 2022 CHNA process identified pregnant women as one of the population of patients impacted by COVID -19 in relation to increased anxiety and depression, and decreased access to behavioral health care. Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 259 In addition, participants identified maternal and infan t health with a focus on the Black commu nity as an educational topic of particular interest and importance to employee professional development. According to SMBHWN discharge data presented in the SMH 2022 CHNA, more than a third (34.8%) of women admitted for preterm labor in 2020 were enrolled in Medi -Cal, and 80.0% were ages 18 to 34 years. In addition, 36.0% of preterm babies were identified as Hispanic or Latino, and 55.0% were male. Among women enrolled in Medi -Cal who gave birth at SMBHWN in 2020, 60. 3% presented with a complication during childbirth. Within this group, the most common complications were obesity (31.6%), abnormalities in fetal heart rate and rhythm (28.2%) and anemia (23.1%). Hospital data analysis also identified disparities among som e demographic groups in relation to preg nancy -related inpatient admissions. For example, Asian or Pacific Islander women accounted for 14.9% of all female inpatients at SMBHWN, but 25.0% of gestational diabetes inpatients. In 2020, SDC had 2,493 LBW births , which accounted for 6.7% of all live b irths. In the same year, there were 403 VLBW births, or 1.1% of all births. When compared to all other racial groups, the proportions of LBW and VLBW births in SDC were highest among African American and black infant s, representing 10.9% and 3.4% of all bi rths, respectively. 295 In 2020, 119 infants in SDC died before their first birthday. The infant mortality rate was 3.2 infant deaths per 1,000 live births . There were 3,180 preterm births in SDC in 2020, represent ing 8.6% of all births countywide. In 2020, 32,891 live births received early prenatal care in SDC, which translates to 88.8% of all live births in the region. According to HP2030, prenatal care is most effect ive when it starts early and continues throug hout pregnancy. It can help prevent and address health problems in both mothers and babies. Interventions to increase access to health care can help more women get the prenatal care they need.303 Live Well San Die go's ( LWSD) Report Card on Children, Families, and Community, 2021 identified the following barriers to use of prenatal care: financial barriers, such as lack of health insurance; context of care, such as biased treatment from providers or low cultural com petence; acc ess issues, such as transportation, difficulty obtaining an appointment or inconvenient hours; and personal attitudes and behaviors, such as lack of understanding about the importance of prenatal care and ambivalence about a pregnancy.304 Proven strategies to increase the use of prenatal care include affordable health coverage, expedited health coverage for uninsured pregnant women, insurance coverage that includes health education and risk counseling, outreach and assistance with health coverage enrollment and accessing affordable prenatal services, use of safety net health providers, culturally and linguistically appropriate prenatal services, home visits for high -risk pregnant women, coaching and support 303 HP2030 (2022), Increase the proportion pregnant women who receive early and adequate prenatal care \u2014 MICH08 304 The Children's Initiative (2022), Live Well San Diego Report Card on Children, Families, and Community, 2021. Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 260 from trained and certified doulas and co mmunity hea lth workers, group care approaches to reduce costs and enhance care, and transportation assistance.304 According to the Mayo Clinic, sometimes a h igh-risk pregnancy is the result of a medical conditi on present before pregnancy. Risk factors include being older than 35; lifestyle choices such as smoking, drinking alcohol, and using illegal drugs; pregnancy complications; having a multiple pregnancy; and a history of pregnancy - related disorders , such as hypertension and giving birth prematurely.305 According to 2021 CHIS data, 20.3% of women ages 18 to 64 years in SDC were obese ( body mass index > 30), lower than the state of California overall (29.9%).294 According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , being overweight increases the risk of pregnancy complications, including preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, stillbirth and cesarean delivery. Obesity during pregnancy is also associated with incr eased use of health care and physician services, and longer hospital stays for delivery.306 Factors associated with preterm birth incl ude maternal age, race, socioeconomic status, tobacco use, substance use, stress, prior preterm births, carrying more than one baby, and infection.306 Although just 1 in 10 U.S. infants were born preterm in 2021, the year represented the highest rate reported in at least 14 years. The preterm birth rate rose by 4% between 2020 and 2 021, and racial and ethnic differences in preterm birth rates continued to persist. The rate of preterm birth among Black women (14.8%) in 2021 was about 50% higher than the rate among white or Hispanic women (9.5% and 10.2% respectively).307 According to Ma rch of Dimes data, the rate of preterm births in the state of California was 8.8% in 2020 \u2014 lower than the national average (10.1%). However, racial disparities have worsened in California, where the rate of average preterm births among Black women (12.3%) were highest from 2018 to 2020, followed by American Indian/ Alaska Native (11.7%), Hispanic (9.1%), Asian/Pacific Islander (8.3%) and White women (7.8%).308 Policy solutions and actions that can help address limited access to maternity care include expandin g Medicaid; raising parental income eligibility levels under Medicaid; extending the Medicaid postpartum coverage period, expanding access to midwifery and doula services; providing coverage for pregnancy and postpartum services; increasing inve stments in community social determinants of health ( SDOH ) to reduce disparities and improve health outcomes; and researching the causes of maternal death.309 Objectives Develop, coordinate and provide educational program s for the community on maternal and prenatal care topics, including preterm labor and births 305 Mayo Clinic (2022), High-risk pregnancy: Know what to expect . 306 Center s for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) Division of Reproductive Health ;National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (2022), Maternal Infant Health. 307 Martin, J.A., Hamilton, B.E., and Osterman, M.J.K.

In FY 2022, SMBHWN continued to offer all maternal and prenatal care classes online to ensure safe, ongoing educati on for expectant mothers and families during the COVID -19 pand emic. SMBHWN taught nearly 120 expectant parents about the warning signs of preterm labor and how to help prevent a premature birth through free, monthly Preterm Birth Prevention classes. In Fe bruary, May and August, SMBHWN hosted free Planning for Pregna ncy events, which provided pre -pregnancy education to more than 70 community members. Topics included preparing the body for pregnancy, having a baby later in life, reproductive planning, optimi zing conception, implications of COVID -19 for pregnancy, fertility challenges and treatments, and available support groups and classes at SMBHWN. SMBHWN also hosted several new free webinars addressing high -risk pregnancy in FY 2022. In November, a Prepar ing for Multiples: Pregnancy and Birth webinar shared educatio n with 12 attendees about the specifics of pregnancy and delivery of multiples. Additionally, a free Baby on the Way webinar provided nearly 230 attendees over seven sessions with education abou t SMBHWN classes and support groups, as well as the opportunit y to ask specialists questions regarding pregnancy and childbirth. Throughout the year, SMBHWN health experts provided interviews and articles to educate the community about important topics r elated to pregnancy, maternity and women's health. Information was shared through the hospital's Facebook page; Sharp Health News; and media outlets including San Diego Magazine , The San Diego Union - Tribune , CBS 8 San Diego, KPBS, KUSI, 10News - ABC San Di ego KGTV , NBC 7 San Diego and KOGO. Topics featured strengthen ing the pelvic floor, pregnancy at a later age, high -risk pregnancy, preeclampsia and pregnant women receiving the COVID -19 vaccine. SMBHWN also offered several low -cost prenatal classes in FY 2022. Classes focused on preparing for childbirth as well as b asic information about caring for a baby. Topics included how the body prepares for birth and delivery; hospital procedures; relaxation Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 262 and breathing techniques; medication choices; caesarean delivery; newborn characteristics and procedures; and basic infa nt care. Fees for these classes were waived specifically for pregnant teens to help improve their access to important prenatal education . Other low -cost prenatal classes covered the following topics: preparing families with dogs for life with a baby; basic infant sleep patterns and strategies to support the early months of parenting; labor comfort measures and relaxation skills to support the birthing experience; and the joys and challenges of parents expecting twins, triplets or more. In May, SMBHWN parti cipated in the annual Sharp Women's Health Conference. Team members answered attendees' questions on topics including pre - and postnatal health, hospital services, and visitation guidelines during COVID -19. In addition, SMBHWN provided year -round fundraisi ng support for the 2022 San Diego Heart & Stroke Walk. During the walk in September, team members hosted an informational booth with resources on cardiac disease for women. The Sharp Mary Birch NRI was launched in 2013 to discover new, leading -edge treatments and practices in newborn care and disseminate research findings to improve outcomes for at -risk newborns throughout the world . Led by a multidisciplinary team of physicians, nurses, respiratory therapists, researchers and data analysts, the NRI has participated in more than 60 clinical trials with over 3, 400 newborns enrolled. The NRI values the community's perspective in shaping the future of care provided in the neonatal intensive care unit ( NICU ). Through the NRI Parent Advisory Board, parents a nd grandparents of infants who have been in the NICU offer the NRI their unique points of view, including feedback on proposed and curre nt clinical trials to help ensure that other parents understand and feel comfortable participating in them. In addition, NRI Parent Advisory Board members may participate on Sharp's Institutional Review Board when a new trial involving babies is presented and may be involved in the decision to either approve, change or disapprove of a trial. The NRI has received funding s upport from personal donations as well as from various foundations and organizations, including Gerber Foundation, Thrasher Research Fun d, Little Giraffe Foundation, Alexander and Eva Nemeth Foundation, Cushman Foundation, the Kenneth T. and Eileen L. Norr is Foundation, the Samuel H. French III and Katherine Weaver French Fund, and the Chuck and Ernestina Kreutzkamp Foundation. In addition , the NRI has received four grants from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), including most recently in July 2018 to support its leadership of an international, multi -hospital (including Sharp Grossmont Hospital) study on umbilical cord milking and its benefits to the long -term health of infants who need resuscitation at birth. With completion expected in 2023, this is the largest and most comprehensive cord milking study with the potential to improve how babies are cared for worldwide. The NRI's medica l discoveries have been featured by multiple news networks and publications, including 10News - ABC San Diego KGTV , CNN, FOX 5 San Diego, NBC 7 San Diego, KPBS, The San Diego Union -Tribune, Del Mar Times , New Scientist , News Medical , Physicians Weekly, Res piratory Care, U.S. News and NIH. Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 263 In addition, the NRI works closely with SMBHWN's Nemeth NICU Follow -Up Clinic, which provides neurodevelopmental assessments, testing and referrals for early interventions to promote optimal growth and success for babies born preterm or with other conditions that place them at risk for developmental delay. The services and interventions pr ovided by the Nemeth NICU Follow -Up Clinic help validate the results of the NRI's innovative research studies. FY 2023 Plan SMB HWN will do the following:310 Provide free monthly virtual Preterm Birth Prevention classes Develop and provide free and low -cost prenatal classes for expectant mothers and families Provide prenatal classes both virtually and in -person Provide education to high-risk populations Provide fundraising support for March of Dimes Provide education and outreach at community health fair s and events Identify evidence -based best practices for newborn care through the NRI Identified Community Need: Mat ernal Care - Meeting the Needs of New Mothers and their Families Rationale references the findings of the SMH 2022 CHNA, HASD&IC 2022 CHN A or the most recent SDC community health statistics unless otherwise indicated. Rationale The SMH 2022 CHNA identified maternal and prenatal care, including high -risk pregnancy, as one of the priority health and social needs affecting the community memb ers served by SMH. Within this need, the following themes were identified: declining fertilit y trends; maternal and infant health; infant mortality; high -risk pregnancy; and behavioral health. In 2020, California hospitals performed better than the nationa l average in implementing various maternal care practices and policies to improve breastfeedi ng outcomes, including immediate postpartum care, rooming -in, feeding practices, discharge support, and institutional management.311 According to LWSD's San Diego Co unty Report Card on Children and Families , 2021 , breastfeeding enhances immunity to disease, decreases the rate and severity of diarrhea and infections in children, is associated with healthy development and decreased risk of childhood obesity, and reduces lifelong risks for chronic health 310 Where applicable, Sharp Mary Birch Hospital for Women & Newborns ( SMBHW N) will perform these activities as COVID -19 public health and safety guidelines allow. 311 CDC (2021), California 2020 Report, CDC Survey of Maternity Practices in Infant Nutrition and Care . Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 264 problems. Mothers who breastfeed may have a reduced risk of some cancers, quicker postpartum recovery time, and less work missed due to child illness.304 The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that babies be exclusively breastfed for approximately the first six months of life, followed by continued breastfeeding with complementary foods for one year or longer.312 According to a fact sheet titled Achieving Breastfeeding Eq uity in California, most mothers need support during their hospital stay to overcome common breastfeeding challenges. Mothers who experience supportive practices during their hospital stay are more likely to breastfeed exclusively than those who do not.313 Accordin g to the California Task Force on Status of Maternal Mental Health Care, depression and anxiety are the most common complications associated with pregnancy and childbirth. These disorders affect up to 1 in 5 mothers, or approximately 100,000 women i n Calif ornia each year, yet research suggests that most women remain undiagnosed and untreated.314 In 2017, the cost of untreated perinatal mood and anxiety disorders in California was estimated at $2.4 billion for all births. This includes costs incurred du e to m edical interventions, low -income health care, welfare payments, work absenteeism and lost productivity from the mom's pregnancy through the child's first five years of life.314 Research suggests that the most common risk factors for postpartum depression (PPD) are life stress, lack of social support, current or past abuse, prenatal depression and marital or partner dissatisfaction. Understanding risk factors for PPD informs healt h care providers and contri butes to the development of prevention and screening strategies for the most vulnerable women.315 Approximately 52% of U.S. pregnancy -related deaths occur postpartum, with 19% occurring between one and six days postpartum and 21% occurring between one and si x weeks postpartum.316 According to an issue brief comparing maternal mortality rates, the U.S. has the highest maternal mortality rate compared to 10 other high -income countries. This may be related to several factors: an underr epresentation in midwives in the maternity care workforce relative to obstetrician/gynecologists (OB -GYN); an overall shortage of maternity care providers (both OB -GYNs and midwives); the limited role of primary care in the health care system; and a lack o f comprehensive postpartum support.316 A 2018 committee opinion paper from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists titled Optimizing Postpartum Care recommends that physicians treat postpartum care as an ongoing and tailore d process between mother, provider and community resources, beginning within the first three weeks postpartum and 312 American Academy of Pediatrics (2022), American Academy of Pediatrics Calls for More Support for Breastfeeding Mo thers Within Updated Policy Recommendations . 313 California W omen Infants & Children Association and the U niversity of California Davis Human Lactation Center (2020), Achieving Breastfeeding Equity in C alifornia . 314 California Task Force on Maternal Mental Health Care (2019), Maternal Mental Health: State of the State Repo rt in California and Beyond, a Follow -up Report, December 2019 . 315 Hutchens, B.F. and Kearney, J.

This suggests that acute environmental stressors may be perceived as more stressful when one considers how it may affect pregnancy, childbirth, and parenting.318 Objectives Provide education and support to new mothers on the importance of breastfeeding Provide postpartum education and support to new mothers a nd their families Educate community members about maternal and child health topics and available hospital resources th rough news interviews and articles Support vulnerable patients and families through the provision of free diapers to those facing economi c hardships, and connections to community resources to address other barriers to health equity FY 2022 Report of Activities In FY 2022, SMBHWN continued to provide educational classes and support groups to address the needs of new mothers and families. M ost opportunities were provided virtually to ensure participant health and safety during the COVID -19 pandemic. SMBHWN served approximately 280 new moth ers through its free breastfeeding support group. Facilitated by an experienced lactation educator, th e group was offered three times per week to assist new parents with breastfeeding challenges. The breastfeeding support group was initially offered virtua lly in FY 2022 ; however , in August, relaxed pandemic restrictions allowed for two, in -person support g roups each week along with one virtual support group for mothers unable to attend the in -person sessions. Topics included latching, pumping breastmilk, ba by behavior and sleep issues. Parents were also referred to the hospital's New Beginnings Boutique (NBB) for additional breastfeeding resources. The hospital's weekly Baby and Me Time virtual support group helped new parents transition from giving birth to returning home with their newborn. The free group provided an opportunity to share the unique exper iences and responsibilities of parenthood, enhance knowledge and confidence as a new parent and develop new friendships. All parents from the community we re invited to participate in Baby and Me Time, which included a variety of first -time parents, includi ng those preparing to go back to work, military families, single parents and stay -at-home parents. The group also offered expecting parents insight into w hat parenthood might look like for them. Serving 317 American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (2018), Optimizing postpartum care .

SMBHWN provided specialized education and support during the year through free, virtual postpartum support groups led by a licensed clinical social worker . A weekly group prov ided emotional support to mothers in the community with babies ages newborn to 12 months who were dealing with feelings of anxiety or depression related to the challenges of new motherhood. Understanding that PPD and anxiety can also affect fathers, SMBHWN offered a monthly postpartum support group for couples. A range of topics were addressed during the groups, including feelings of isolation, parenting st ruggles, postpartum mood disorders, how to seek support, professional referrals and coping strategies. In addition, the impact of COVID -19 continued to be a central topic of discussion within the groups. Participants explored the unique challenges posed by the pandemic during an already difficult time, including how to safely reengage with friends, family and the community following isolation. To promote additional healthy coping methods, the support group leader connected participants to online community p lay groups and other virtual parent groups. Together, the hospital's postpartum support groups engaged nearly 430 parents in FY 2022. SMBHWN also offered a free class titled Pelvic Floor Wellness in Pregnancy, Birth and After Delivery to help promote suc cessful postpartum recovery. Facilitated by a physical therapist, the monthly class served over 170 co mmunity members. Additionally, SMBHWN staff devoted nearly 640 hours to daily Family Home Care classes that provided critical information and support to m ore than 2,900 new mothers and family members. Topics included car seat safety, sudden infant death sy ndrome, shaken baby syndrome, breastfeeding, jaundice and signs and symptoms of illness among mothers and babies. Free NICU CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscita tion) education was also provided in English and Spanish to approximately 470 family and friends of th e hospital's NICU babies. Additionally, SMBHWN provided webinars throughout the year to support new parents. In April, a webinar titled The Fourth Trimes ter: Navigating Your Postpartum Recovery provided education to approximately 50 attendees about naviga ting the early recovery process that occurs during the \"fourth trimester \" \u2014 the first three months after birth. Topics covered included postpartum body ch anges, tips to recognize symptoms of common postpartum conditions and strategies to support mental hea lth. In July, a Partner Bootcamp: How to Support Your Partner During Postpartum webinar, led by a Sharp social worker and licensed marriage and family the rapist, provided nearly 50 attendees with tools to support their significant other as they managed the early recovery process and navigated their new relationship as parents. In September, a Feeding Your Baby, Your Way webinar provided nearly 50 new and ex pecting parents with education about different feeding methods, what to expect in the first month postpartum and planning for transitioning back to work. Throughout the year, SMBHWN health experts provided interviews and articles to educate the community about important maternal and newborn health topics. Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 267 Information was shared through the hospital's Face book page; Sharp Health News; and media outlets including KOGO, 10News - ABC San Diego KGTV and New Scientist . Topics featured umbilical cord milking, strengthening the pelvic floor, grandparents caring for babies, the positive link between breastfeeding a nd women's heart health, the importance of newborn screenings, women's heart health and the shortage of baby formula. Scientific evidence sho ws that exclusive breastfeeding provides the healthiest start for a newborn's life, especially among very prematur e babies. However, exclusive breastfeeding is not possible for mothers who experience challenges with breastmilk supply and feeding. Pasteuriz ed donor human milk can make breastfeeding possible for these mothers. For more than 15 years, SMBHWN has served a s a donor breastmilk depot, regularly shipping donated breastmilk to the Mothers ' Milk Bank in San Jose, CA, where it is screened, pasteurized and distributed to community hospitals for infants whose mothers have an insufficient breastmilk supply. Since 20 15, SMBHWN has hosted an annual Donor Breastmilk Drive to help increase the supply of breastmilk for the Mothers ' Milk Bank. Although typicall y held in -person, the milk drive was conducted virtually in FY 2022 due to COVID -19. Held in celebration of Nation al Breastfeeding Month in August, the event collected approximately 23 gallons of breastmilk from 25 donors, who received special coolers in w hich to mail their donations to the Mothers ' Milk Bank. In June, SMBHWN partnered with Mothers ' Milk Bank to host a milk drive to help address the increased demand for breastmilk related to the national infant formula shortage. Over the past eight years, S MBHWN's milk drives have collected nearly 375 gallons of breastmilk from more than 240 donors to help feed prematu re infants and those with specialized health needs. SMBHWN expands its support for community mothers and families through the NBB . Located w ithin the hospital, the boutique provides easy access to needed supplies, such as nursing bras and breastfeeding p umps. The boutique's lactation educators are available to answer questions and provide breastfeeding resources and support to anyone who calls or visits the shop. Among its health education efforts, the lactation educators at the NBB have provided weighted feed assistance to families needing additional support with baby feedings through pre - and post -consumption weighing. In FY 2022, NBB staff d edicated nearly 2,000 hours in free breastfeeding education and support to community members. Further, in FY 2022, SMBHWN's NBB donated more than $4,900 in clothing, nursing bras and breastfeeding pumps to support nursing mothers served by San Diego Family Care's Linda Vista Health Care Center. SMBHWN continued to serve as a distributor for the San Diego Food Bank's (Food Bank) Diaper Bank Program. The program helps solve a critical challenge \u2014 namely, the expense of diapers, which are often required to enroll a child in daycare \u2014 for families facing economic hardship. Through the program, diapers are donated to the Food Bank, and participating distributors \u2014 including SMBHWN \u2014 retrieve the diapers to provide them to families in need. SMBHWN d istributed nearly 13,700 diapers to 147 patients in FY 2022 and has provided approximately 38,335 diapers since first joining the program in summer 2019. Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 268 Sharp's Patient Access Services team provides robust services to assist with access to care and healt h insurance coverage for patients at all Sharp hospitals, including patients of SMBHWN. Please refer to Section 1 (Overview): Patient Access to Care Programs for more information on these programs and services. Beginning in FY 2019, SMBHWN joined Sharp's systemwide pilot partnership with 2 -1-1 San Diego's (2 -1-1) Community Information Exchange (CIE ) to better understand and address the health equity barriers that influence the health and well -being of their patients. Research continues to underscore that SDOH \u2014 the conditions under which people live, learn, work and play \u2014 have a significant impact on a person's ability to access care and maintain health. SMBH WN joined the CIE pilot partnership to provide more informed, holistic care to patients with challenges to health equity, and to connect them directly to community resources to meet those needs. Approximately 130 CIE community partners \u2014 including health care organizations, the County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency, housing networks, food banks and other social service agencies \u2014 use an integrated technology platform to support pr oactive, holistic, person -centered care. Shared records enable CIE partners to evaluate an individual's SDOH needs and utilization history of community services and to make direct referrals to critical, community -based resources. SMBHWN case managers and s ocial workers were trained on CIE to better serve vulnerable p atients in the acute care setting, including those patients who experience homelessness, food insecurity and other hardships. Although delays and obstacles to CIE implementation and adoption pe rsisted due to the COVID -19 pandemic during Year 3 of the CIE pilot, utilization metrics were sustained after demonstrating growth between Years 1 and 2. Community members across SDC were assisted through the CIE including residents of Downtown, Mission Va lley, Southeast San Diego, Encanto, El Cajon, Lakeside, La Mes a, Otay Mesa, National City, Chula Vista, Carlsbad, Escondido and Oceanside. The top community referrals provided through the CIE included utilities, food, housing and economic support. Sharp teams continue to work closely with 2 -1-1 on the implementatio n and data integration plans for CIE, which includes evaluation of ongoing metrics, such as system utilization of CIE, referral tracking, case management efficiency, successful connection to com munity referrals and more. Data will be used to re -evaluate th e value and sustainability of CIE for Sharp upon completion of the pilot's fourth year. FY 2023 Plan SMBHWN will do the following:310 Offer f ree, virtual postpartum, breastfeeding, and new parent support groups Host a donor milk drive (either in -person or virtually, pending COVID -19 guidelines) to collect breast milk for the Mothers ' Milk Bank Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 269 Participate in the Food Bank's Diaper Bank Program to provide diapers to families facing economic hardship Participate in 2 -1-1's CIE program to connect patients who experience homelessness and other health equity barriers to critical community services Identified Community Need: Health Professions Educa tion and Training, and Collaboration with Local Schools to Promote Interest and Career Pathways in Health Care Rationale references the findings of the SMH 2022 CHNA, HASD&IC 2022 CHNA or the most community health statistics unl ess otherwise ind icated. Rationale The HASD&IC 2022 CHNA identified workforce shortages as a foundational challenge that greatly exacerbates the priority health and social needs (access to health care, aging care & support, behavioral health, children & youth well -being, chronic health conditions, community safety and economic stability) affecting community members served by SMH. Workforce shortages were described by HASD&IC 2022 CHNA community engagement participants as the number one priority for local health care provi ders. The pandemic has severely strained the existing health care workforce, and staffing shortages have exacerbated challenges in meeting the demand for community services. All health care settings, including behavioral health, were described as understaf fed, and workforce shortages can adversely impact the patient experience. Further, the workforce shortage is creating a wider equity gap, with fewer culturally competent and linguistically appropriate providers available to care for SDC's diverse communiti es. The IPH Sharp Provider and Sharp Human Resources surveys conducted as part of the SMH 2022 CHNA process identified several educational topics of particular interest and importance to employee professional development, includ ing: defining cultural humil ity and applying it to health care; the impact of implicit or unconscious bias on decision -making; maternal and infant health with a focus on the Black community; and health disparities among various groups, including the Black, Asian, Latinx and immigrant communities. Nearly 90% of IPH Sharp Provider Survey participants reported that COVID -19 had at least a moderate impact in employees' desire to change careers or leave the workforce, which may create challenges in meeting the h ealth care needs of the comm unity. Of these, the majority (78%) reported that Sharp does not have programs or services available to address this issue. The San Diego Workforce Partnership (SDWP) reported that, in 2021, there were 186,000 people employed in the health care sector in S DC, accounting for 13% of all jobs countywide.319 319 San Diego Workforce Partnership (2021), Expanding Access to Healthcare Jobs in San D iego County: Healthcare Sector Overview. Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 270 SDWP also cites research by the University of Washington Center for Women's Welfare that estimates the basic needs of a single adult resident of SDC to cost $3,058.72 per month, requiring full -time employmen t at $17.65 an hour. Of the 20 most common occupations in SDC's health care sector, there are 11 with training requirements less than or equal to an associate degree that can provide new graduates with a living wage.319 Total employment in California is projected to grow 16% between 2020 and 2030, reflecting an increase of 2.8 million jobs statewide over the decad e. The educational services (private), health care and social assistance sector is expected to be o ne of the fastest -growing industries in California, with 19.0% growth anticipated.320 According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' Employment Projections - 2021 - 2031 report, employment in health care and social assistance is projected to add about 2.6 m illion jobs from 2021 to 2031 \u2014 the highest growth among all industry sectors. Factors that are expected to contribute to this growth include rising demand for the care of an aging baby -boom population, longer life expectancies and higher prevalence of chr onic conditions.321 According to a report from the California Health Care Foundation (CHCF) titled California Physicians: A Portrait of Practice , the supplie s of physicians, physician assistants and three types of advanced practice nurses in California grew between 2016 and 2020, while the supply of clinical nurse specialists decreased. The increased supply of licensed physicians does not accurately reflect th e availability of care, however \u2014 less than half of California's physicians provided care 40 or more hours per week.322 According to a report titled Health Workforce Strategies for California, studies conducted over the past four decades demonstrate that mu lti-component pipeline programs for high school, college and post -baccalaureate students underrepresen ted in the health professions positively impact a variety of outcomes with the potential to improve the diversity of the health care workforce.323 Although California has enacted various policies to increase both the size and the diversity of the health wor kforce, current public and private sector efforts have not been sufficient to alleviate existing shortages.323 The California Future Health Workforce Commission (CFHWC) has described several recent state budge t and policy actions intended to address the significant health and economic impacts of the COVID -19 pandemic. This includes investments in the mental health workforce, particularly for those who work with children and youth; investments in phys ician resid encies, with an emphasis on psychiatry; additional California Department of Health Care Access and Information324 oversight for state -supported health workforce programs; expanding the scope of practice for nurse practitioners; and creating sever al new reimb ursable provider types, such as community health workers.325 320 Califor nia Employment Development Department (2022), Employment Projections . 321 U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (2022), Employment Projections - 2021 -2031 . 322 California Health Care Foundation (CHCF) (2021), California Physicians, 2021 : A Portrait of Practice . 323 CHCF (2021), Health Workforce Strategies for California: A review of the Evidence. 324 California's Depar tment of Health C are Access and Information was formerly known as the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development . 325 California Future Heal th Workforce Comm ission (CFHWC) (2022), January 2022 Update on Health Workforce Progress. Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 271 According to CFHWC key informant interviews with private sector health care leaders, California's workforce needs include increasing workforce diversity; educating young Californians t hat futures i n the health sector are appealing regardless of background, socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity, and gender; and partnering with schools and companies to remove barriers to continuing education and develop pipelines for jobs.326 A CHCF survey of frontline health care workers during COVID -19 reflects the sustained mental and emotional toll of providing patient care during the pandemic. Six in 10 providers continue to feel overworked and burned out, while nearly half are frustrated by their job. Nearly three out of four nurses (72%) say they feel burned out from their work \u2014 higher than the 61% reported among nurse practitioners and physician assistants, 57% among doctors, and 56% among behavioral health specialists.327 Objectives Collaborate with local school s, colleges and universities to provide opportunities for students to explore and train for a variety of health care professions Provide education and training for students interested in health care careers Provide obstetrical, gynecological and neonatal e ducation and training for health care professionals Identify and disseminate evidence -based best practices to improve outcomes of at - risk newborns through the NRI Participate in local and national organizations to share special ty expertise and enhance lear ning for the broader health care community FY 2022 Report of Activities In FY 2022, SMBHWN collaborated with local, state and national schools, colleges and universities to provide hospital -based opportunities for students to explore and train for a vari ety of careers in health care. Although still significant, in FY 2022, on -site student learning remained impacted by COVID -19. SMBHWN served as a training site for more than 130 nursing students and eight ancillary (non -nursing) students in FY 2022, who s pent over 11,800 hours on the hospital campus. Academic institution partners included California State University Dominguez Hills, Pima Medical Institute , Point Loma Nazarene University, San Diego State University, San Joaquin Valley College, Southwestern College, University of California San Diego Extension and University of San Diego. SMBHWN also partnered with Midwestern Un iversity in Glendale, Arizona , to provide physician -led mentorship opportunities for 11 medical students. In December, a SMBHWN staff member provided 36 freshman students at Clairemont High School with a presentation about nursing career opportunities and reasons to pursue a career in the field of nursing. 326 CFHWC (2020), Meeting the Demand fo r Health: Top Priorities, Challenges, and Proposed Actions for the Private Sec tor to Support the Workforce California Needs . 327 CHCF (2021), COVI D-19 Tracking Poll, May 2021 Views from Cal ifornia Health Care Providers on the Front Lines . Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 272 In FY 2022, SMBHWN resumed its participation in the HSHMC program, providing valuable health care experience, including job requirements and career ladder development, to ninth through 12 th grade studen ts. During the school year, 21 HSHMC students devoted nearly 980 hours to rotations with maternal infant services, the NICU and the t ransport team. In FY 2022, the NRI shared its expertise and groundbreaking research developments with the greater health and research communities. Virtual presentations were also provided to support socially distanced professional learning during COVID -19. Presentation topics included, but were not limited to, state -of-the-art delivery room resuscitation, technologies to opt imize delivery room resuscitation and concepts and controversies in umbilical cord management for newborn infants. Further , the NRI's research findings have been shared in several distinguished medical journals. In FY 2022, this included the American Journ al of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Clinics in Perinatology, American Academy of Pediatrics, NeoReviews, Pediatric Cardiology, Journal o f Perinatology , American Journal Perinatology BMJ of Maternal -Fetal & Neonatal Medicine , Seminars in Fetal and Neonatal Medicine and Journal of Pediatrics . The NRI also continued to offer a Bedside Ultrasound Training for Neonatologists course \u2014 a multi -week training that consists of hands -on, one -on-one training sessions and expert lectures on theoretic al and practical ultrasound techniques for neonatologists. Open to local, regional, national and international neonatologists, the course is one of only a few similar training programs in the country. SMBHWN team members also contributed their expertise to the broader health care community through participation in professional conferences and events. In September, SMBHWN participated in S harp's Annual Interprofessional Research & Innovations Conference. Held virtually in response to COVID -19, the event in vited community health care professionals to participate in podium and poster presentations intended to stimulate innovation in the pract ice setting, identify best practices, disseminate research, encourage interprofessional collaboration, and more. A SMBH WN neonatal clinical nurse specialist provided a panel presentation on recognizing and mitigating implicit bias as well as insight on SMB HWN's Project Aim, a quality improvement project to increase skin -to-skin contact among parents and their infants with the goal of decreasing disparities in care. In addition, in FY 2022, SMBHWN team members served on boards and committees for local and na tional organizations, including YWCA, SCANN, HSHMC, CWISH, AHA, Howell Foundation and the Perinatal Social Work Cluster .

Costs for patients paid through the Medicare program on a prospective basis also include payments to third parties related to the specific population. 329 Charity care and bad debt reflect the unreimb ursed costs of providing services to patients who lack the ability to pay for services at the time the services were rendered. 330 \"Vulnerable populations\" means any population that is exposed to medical or financial risk by virtue of being uninsured, underinsured, or elig ible for Medi -Cal, Medicare, California Children's Services Program, or county indigent programs. 331 Unreimbursed co sts may include an hourly rate for labor and benefits, plus costs for supplies, materials and other purch ased services. Any offsetting revenue (such as fees, grants or external donations) is deducted from the costs of providing service s. Unreimbursed costs were estimated by each department responsible for providing the program or service. Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 276 Figure 23: Percentage of Community Benefit by SB 697 Category Sharp Memorial Hospital \u2014 FY 2022 Key highlights: Medical Care Services included uncompensated care for patients who are unable to pay for services and unreimbursed costs of public programs, such as Medi -Cal, Medicare, CMS and CHAMPVA/TRIC ARE.332 In FY 2020, the State of California and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Ser vices approved a Medi -Cal Hospital Fee Program for the time period of July 1, 2019, through December 31, 2021 , and in FY 2022 the same agencies approved another Medi -Cal Hospital Fee Program for the time period of January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2022. This resulted in recognition of net supplemental revenues for SMH totaling $ 15.6 million in FY 2022. This reimbursement helped offset prior years' unreimbursed medical care services; however, the additional funds recorded in FY 2022 understate the true un reimbursed medical care services performed for the past fiscal year. 332 The Civilian Healt h and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs (CHAMPVA) is a health benefits program in which the Department of Veterans Affairs shares t he cost of certain health care services and supplies with eligible beneficiaries. TRICARE is a health car e program of the U.S. Department of Defense Military Health System , which provides civilian health benefits for U.S Armed Forces military personnel, mi litary retirees, and their dependents, including some members of the Reserve Component.

Other Benefits for the Broader Community included education and resources on a variety of health topics; participation in community health fairs and events; support groups; health screenings for blood pressure, body composition and musculoskeletal conditions; and community education and resources provided by the SMH Laurel Amtower C ancer Institute and Neuro -Oncology Amtower Cancer Institute) . In additio n, SMH donated meeting room space to community groups as well as collaborated with local schools to promote student interest and career pathways in health care. SMH staf f actively participated in community boards, committees and other civic organizations, including the Serra Mesa Planning Group Board, American College of Healthcare Executives, San Diego Chapter of the American Association of Critical -Care Nurses (AACN) , San Diego Black Nurses Association, San Diego National Association of Hispanic Nurses, E mergency Nurses Association - San Diego Chapter, Trauma Center Association of America Board of Directors, Association of Oncology Social Work, San Diego County Stroke Consortium, Adult Protective Services, Health Subcommittee for the San Diego Regional Hum an Trafficking and Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children (CSEC) Advisory Council , Serving Seniors, Community Center for the Blind and Visually Impaired, Caregiver C oalition of San Diego (Caregiver Coalition) and San Diego County Council on Aging (SDCCOA). See Appendix A for a listing of Sharp HealthCare's (Sharp) involvement in community organizations in FY 2022. The category also include s costs associated with community benefit planni ng and administration, including community health needs assessment (CHNA) development and participation. Health Research, Education and Training Programs included time devoted to education and training of he alth care professionals, student and intern supe rvision, and time devoted to generalizable health -related research projects that were made available to the broader health care community. Definition of Community SMH is located at 7901 Frost St. in San Die go, ZIP code 92123. SMH OPP is located at 3075 H ealth Center Drive in San Diego, ZIP code 92123. SMH serves all of San Diego County (SDC); however, the primary communities served by the hospital include the City of San Diego, Chula Vista, SDC's east regio n and the North Inland communities surrounding Rancho Bernardo. See Appendix B for a map of community and region boundaries in SDC. Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 278 For SMH's 2022 CHNA process, the Dignity Health/IBM Watson Health Community Need Index (CNI) w as used to identify communities within its service area that experience greater health inequities.333,334 The CNI uses demographic and economic statistics to provide a \"CNI score\" for every populated ZIP code in the U.S. CNI scores measure inequity on a scale ranging from very low health inequity to very high health inequity. This measurement is an average determined through an analysis of specific socioeconomic barriers to health care access, including education, income, culture/language, insurance, and housin g. As such, the CNI demonstrates the link between community need, acce ss to care and preventable hospitalizations. According to the CNI, communities served by SMH with especially high need include a number of communities in SDC's south, central and east regions.333 Figure 24 presents a map of the CNI findings across SDC. 333 Dignity Health and IBM Watson Health Community Need Index ( CNI) (2022). The Dignity Health and IBM Watson CNI was discontinued on January 31, 2023. 334 According to the World Health Organization ( WHO ), health inequities are differences in health status or in the distributi on of health resources between different population groups arising from the social conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work and age. These inequities have significant social and economic costs both to individuals and societies (WHO, 2018). Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 279 Figure 24: CNI Map \u2014 SDC335 Description of Community Health In 2022, there were 525,919 residents age s 65 and old er in SDC, representing 15.8% of the population. Between 2022 and 2027, it is anticipated that SDC's senior population will grow by 14.1%.336 In 2020, 10.9% of the SDC population reported living below 100% of the federal poverty level (FPL). The county's un employment rate was 5.9% and 5.1% of households received Supplemental Security Income.337 335 Truven Health Analytics, 2022; Insurance Coverage Estimates, 2022; Nielson Company, 2022; and CNI, 2022. 336 SpeedTrack\u00a9, Inc.; U.S. Census Bureau. 337 The County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency (HHSA), Public Health Services (PHS), Community Hea lth Statistics Unit (CHSU) , December 2022, U.S. Census Bureau, 2016 -2020 American Community Survey 5-year estimates. Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 280 According to the San Diego Hunger Coalition, while nutrition insecurity338 has declined since 2021, high rates remain due to long -standing economic dispari ties that were exacerbated by the c oronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID -19) pandemic . As of March 2022, 28% of San Diegans experienced nutrition insecurity and 35% of children lived in nutrition -insecure households.339 In 2020, 7.1% of households in SDC receive d Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, while 16.7% of the population lived at or below 138% FPL and were eligible for the program.337 Please refer to Table 47 for SNAP participation and eligibility in SD C.

Please refer to Section 3: Community Benefit Planning Process for a detailed description of Sharp's process and findings. In acco rdance with federal regulations, the SMH 2022 CHNA also includes needs identified for communities served by Sharp Mary Birch Hospital for Women & Newborns Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 283 (SMBHWN), as the two hospitals share a license and report all utilization and financial data as a sin gle entity to the California Department of Health Care Access and Information (HCAI).345 In addition, this year SMH updated its implementation strategy \u2014 a description of SMH programs designed to address the priority health and social needs identified in t he 2022 CHNA. Through the SMH 2022 CHNA, the following priority health and social needs were identified for the communities se rved by SMH (listed in alphabetical order): Access to Health Care Aging Care & Support Behavioral Health Children & Youth Well -being Chronic Health Conditions Community Safety Economic Stability Maternal & Prenatal Health , including High -Risk Pregnancy The following pages detail SMH programs, activities and services that specifically address these needs, either directly or indir ectly. Please refer to Section 1 (Overview): Patient Access to Care Program s for additional entity and systemwide programs designed to address access to health care. SMH does not have the resources to comprehensively addr ess the identified need of behavioral health (including substance use). Consequently, this identified need is addressed through the programs and services provided through Sharp Mesa Vista Hospital (SMV) and Sharp McDonald Center, which are the major provid ers of behavioral health and substance use treatment services in SDC. P lease refer to Section 11 of this report for details on those programs. SMH and SMV are conveniently located on the Sharp Metropolitan Medical Campus (SMMC) . The identified need of maternal a nd prenatal care, including high -risk pregnancy, is addressed at SMBHWN, a specialty hospital providing care for women, newborns and expectant mothers in SDC, also located on the SMMC campus. Please see Section 9 of this report for details on SMBHWN's services that address this identified community need. SMH addresses chronic health conditions by providing education and healthy lifestyle programs as part of care for cardiovascular disease (CVD ), cancer, diabetes, obesity and other health issues influenced by healthy weight and exercise. Sharp Rees -Stealy Medical Centers throughout SDC provide community members with structured weight manag ement and health education programs, such as smoking cess ation and stress 345 California's Department of Health Care Access and Information was formerly known as the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 284 management, long -term support for weight management and personalized weight -loss programs. For additional details on SMH programs that specifically address the needs identified in th e 2022 CHNA, please refer to SMH's implementation strateg y. The most recent CHNA and implementation strategy for SMH are available at http://www.sharp.com/about/community/he alth-needs -assessments.cfm . For each priority community need identified above, subsequent pages include a summary of the rationale and importance of the need, objective(s), FY 2022 Report of Activities conducted in suppo rt of the objective(s), and FY 2023 Plan. Identified Community Need: Diabetes Education, Prevention and Support Rationale references the findings of the SMH 2022 CHNA, HASD&IC 2022 CHNA or the most recent SDC community health statistics unless otherwise indicated. Rationale The HASD&IC and SMH 2022 CHNAs identified chronic conditions, includ ing diabetes, as one of the priority health needs affecting the community members served by SMH. Data analysis in the SMH 2022 CHNA revealed a higher volu me of hospital discharges due to Type 2 diabetes in communities within SDC facing greater socioeconom ic challenges.346 Participants in the interviews conducted by community health workers and promotor es as part of the HASD&IC 2022 CHNA identified diabetes as a major health concern among community members. HASD&IC community engagement participants identifie d lack of access to utilities and household appliances as a challenge to diabetes management due to the importance of proper medication storage and preparation of nutritious meals. Analysis of Sharp clinical data from FY 2016 to 2021 showed a 35% increase in diabetes diagnoses among hospital inpatients, demonstrating the impact of patients delaying care due to the COVID -19 pandemic. In addition, the ratio of diabetes deaths observed at Sharp hospitals in 2021 was 89% higher than expected when compared to 20 16. Furthermore, more than half (58.3%) of SMH inpatients with a diabetes diagnosis in 2020 were seniors. In addition, according to Sharp hospital data, 40% of COVID -19 inpatients admitted from March 2020 to March 2022 presented with diabetes, and individu als with diabetes were 2.1 times more likely to be admitted to the hospital than non -diabetic COVID -19 patients. In addition, COVID -19 patients with diabetes were 82% more likely to require a stay in the intensive care unit (ICU). In 2020, diabetes was th e eighth leading cause of death in SDC.343,344 In 2019, there were 760 deaths due to diabetes in SDC overall. The age -adjusted death rate due to diabetes was 20.6 per 100,000 population. 346 Dignity Health and IBM Watson Health CNI (2022). Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 285 In 2019, there were 4,854 hospitalizations due to diabetes in SDC. The age -adjusted rate of hospitalization was 137.2 per 100,000 population.347 In 2019, there were 5,905 diabetes -related emergency department ( ED) visits in SDC. The a ge-adjusted rate of diabetes -related ED visits was 169.1 per 100,000 population. According to 2021 CHIS data, 8.5% of adults living in SDC indicated that they had ever been diagnosed with diabetes, which was lower than the state of California (10.8%). Diab etes rates among seniors were particularly high, with 16.3% of SDC adults age s 65 and older reporting that they had ever been diagnosed with diabetes.342 According to 2021 CHIS data, 16.6% of SDC residents had been told by their doctor that they have pre - or borderline diabetes.342 According to a report from the American Diabetes Association (ADA) titled the Burden of Diabetes in California, approximately 10.5% of ad ults in California are diagnosed with diabetes. In addition, 33.4% of adults have prediabetes.348 Data presented by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC ) indicates that, in 2021, diabetes prevalence in California was highest among non -Hispanic Black individuals (17.5%), followed by Hispanic individuals (13.3.%), non -Hispanic Asian individuals (11.5%), and non -Hispanic White individuals (9.2%).349 According to the CDC, diabetes is the seventh leading cause of death in the U.S. In addition, the num ber of adults diagnosed with diabetes in the U.S. has more than doubled in the last 20 years as the U.S. population has aged and become more overweight.350 The CDC's 2022 National Diabetes Statistics Report indicates that 89.8% of adults diagnosed with diabe tes from 2015 to 2018 were overweight or obese, and 69.0% had high blood pressure. Factors that may reduce the risk of diabetes complications include having a usual source for diabetes care; meeting recommended physical activity goals; managing or losing w eight; managing A1C levels, blood pressure and cholesterol; and quitting smoking .351 The CDC estimates that 37.3 million people in the U.S. had diabetes in 2019. Of those individuals, 23% met laboratory criteria for diabetes but were not aware they had the d isease.351 According to the CDC, diabetes increases the risk of heart disease and stroke and can lead to other serious complications, such as kidney failure, blindness and amputation of a toe, foot, or leg. Peo ple with diabetes spend more on health care, have fewer productive years and miss more w orkdays compared to people who do not have diabetes.352 347 Count y of San Diego HHSA, PHS, CHSU (2021); U.S. Census Bureau, 201 5-2019 American Community Survey 5 -year estimates. 348 American Diabetes Association ( 2021) , The Burden of Diabetes in California. 349 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (2022), Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, 2021. 350 CDC (2022), Diabetes Fast Facts . 351 CDC (2022), National Diabetes Statistics Report . 352 CDC National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Pro motion (2022), Diabetes and Prediabetes .

The progr am is led by certified diabetes care and education specialists, who provide individuals and their support systems with the skills needed to successfully manage various conditions, inclu ding prediabetes, gestational diabetes (diabetes developed during pregn ancy), as well as Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. In FY 202 2, small group and one -on-one education options were offered in -person or online, in both English and Spanish. In FY 20 22, the Sh arp Diabetes Education Program offered diabetes education and support t o approximately 650 attendees at the Sharp Women's Health Conference. This included diabetes risk assessments using the ADA's Diabetes Risk Test questionnaire as well as resources on topics including the different types of diabetes; diabetes prevention; si gns, symptoms and complications of diabetes; the connection between diabetes and CVD; nutrition and reading food labels; exercise; medication; and diabetes self-management. A Sharp diab etes expert also provided education on the prevention and management of Type 2 diabetes, including helpful diets, physical activity and the power of lifestyle change . At the San Diego Crew Classic rowing event in March, a Sharp Diabetes Education Program n urse provided first aid in the Sharp medical tent and answered health -related questions for approximately 200 attendees In addition, t he Sharp Diabetes Education Program provided fundraising and team participation for the 2022 San Diego Heart & Stroke Walk in September. In addition, the SMH Diabetes Education Program assisted with food distribution at the San Diego First Church of the Nazarene in May and July , serving more than 250 community members. Although the Sharp Diabetes Education Program had anticip ated participating in additional community events, conferences and educ ational presentations throughout FY 202 2, many in-person activities were canceled or postponed due to the COVID -19 pandemic. The SMH Diabetes Education Program is actively involved wit h San Diego's renal health community. In FY 2022 , the program collaborated with the Balboa Institute of Transplantation and the Sharp Kidney and Pancreas Transplant Program to provide ongoing diabetes education and support to more than 200 community member s who are either anticipating or have undergone a kidney trans plant or have experienced kidney disease. Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 287 The Sharp Diabetes Education Program is an affiliate of the California Diabetes and Pregnancy Program's Sweet Success Program, which provides comprehen sive technical support and education to medical personnel and community liaisons to promote improved outcomes for high -risk pregnant women with diabetes. As an affiliate, the Sharp Diabetes Education Program teaches underserved pregnant women and breastfee ding mothers with Type 1, Type 2 or gestational diabetes how t o manage their blood sugar levels. In FY 2022 , the program collaborated with community clinics , including Family Health Centers of San Diego , La Maestra, San Ysidro Health, Neighborhood Healthca re, Borrego Health, and San Diego Family Care to provide patie nts with education and resources to support a healthy pregnancy. Since the onset of the pandemic, the program has accommodated individual preferences by serving patients with virtual, telephone and on -site options. Topics included gestational diabetes statistics ; new diagnostic criteria ; treatment and management of blood glucose levels ; goals for blood sugar levels before and after a meal ; insulin requirements ; self-care practices ; nutrition and meal planning ; exercise and weight management ; monitoring fetal movement ; and the risks and complications of uncontrolled diabetes. Clinic patients also received logbooks to track and manage their blood sugar levels. In addition, the Sharp Diabetes Educati on Program evaluated patients' management of their blood sugar levels and collaborated with community clinics' obstetrician/gynecologists to prevent complications. At SMH, the Sharp Diabetes Education Program provided services and education to nearly 1,140 underserved pregnant and breastfeeding women with diabetes. Throughout the year, the Sharp Diabetes Education Program continued to provide services and resources to meet the needs of culturally diverse populations within SDC. Educational resources inclu ded: How to Live Healthy With Diabetes; What You Need to Know About Diabetes; All About Blood Glucose for People With Type 2 Diabetes; All About Carbohydrate Counting; Getting the Very Best Care for Your Diabetes; All About Insulin Resistance; All About Ph ysical Activity With Diabetes; Gestational Diabetes Mellitus S even -Day Menu Plan; and Food Groups. Resources were provided in Arabic, Somali, Tagalog, Vietnamese and Spanish, and food diaries and logbooks were distributed to help community members track th eir blood sugar levels. Additionally, live interpreter service s were available in more than 200 languages via the Stratus Video Interpreting iPad application. Further, Sharp's certified diabetes care and education specialists received training from the Sha rp Equality Alliance to improve the delivery of inclusive and culturally competent care for diverse communities. In November, the Sharp Diabetes Education Program hosted a diabetes conference for physicians, nurses, pharmacists, laboratorians, clinical an d managerial leaders and other community health professionals interested in optimizing inpatient diabetes care. The conference provided approximately 150 participants with specific tools and strategies for creating a hospital culture that supports and enco urages emerging therapeutic trends in glycemic management. Topics included COVID -19 and how it highlights diabetes concerns ; the use of certain medications and continuous glucose Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 288 monitoring in the inpatient setting; the effect of nutrition on glycemic mana gement ; the importan ce of g lycemic targets ; and d iabetes from a behavioral perspective . In FY 202 2, the Sharp Diabetes Education Program continued to serve as an insulin pump training center to support endocrinologists and primary care physician (PCP) groups throughout SDC. Through this effort, the program trains community providers to use diabetes tec hnology, including insulin pumps and blood glucose monitors, to improve patient care and outcomes. Further, the Sharp Diabetes Education Program recently imp lemented an enhanced electronic medical record system to improve care coordination with more than 3 00 community endocrinologists and PCP groups. FY 202 3 Plan The SMH and Sharp Diabetes Education Programs will do the following:353 Provide prediabetes and d iabetes information to community members at various venues in SDC's central and north central regions, as well as through virtual platforms Offer a webinar series on the role of nutrition in preparation for pregnancy , including information about diabetes Explore collaborations to assist and educa te community members experiencing food insecurity Explore additional opportunities to provide community -based diabetes education Explore future collaborations with community clinics to provide education and resourc es to their patients with diabetes Provid e gestational diabetes services and resources to underserved pregnant and breastfeeding women, both at SMH and community clinics Participate in Tour de Cure \u2014 the ADA's signature fundraising event to fight diabetes \u2014 as well as the San Diego Heart & Stroke Walk Maintain up -to-date resources about diabetes treatment and prevention to support community members with diabetes , particularly foreign language and culturally appropriate resources for diverse populations Participate in local and national conferences to share best practices in diabetes treatment and control with the broader health care community Conduct educational symposiums for health care professionals focused on improving outpatient and inpatient diabetes c are Host a diabetes conference for health care professionals Explore collaboration with SMH's cardiac rehabilitation and cardiac transplant teams to offer quarterly diabetes education to community members Explore collaborations with community organization s that focus on diabetes preve ntion and care Partner with community physicians to help them improve patient outcomes using technology, including insulin pumps and blood glucose monitors 353 Where applicable, Sharp Memorial Hospital ( SMH ) and the Sharp Diabetes Education Program will perform these activit ies as COVID -19 (coronavirus disease 2019) public health and safety guidelines allow. Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 289 Participate in 2 -1-1 San Diego's (2 -1-1) Community Information Exchan ge (CIE) program to serve pati ents with barriers to health equity by connecting them to community services Identified Community Need: Education, Support and Screening for Stroke Rationale references the findings of the SMH 2022 CHNA, HASD&IC 2022 CHNA or the most recent SDC community health statistics unless otherwise indicated. Rationale The HASD&IC and SMH 2022 CHNAs identified chronic conditions (including CVD and cerebrovascular diseases/stroke) as a priority health need affecting community members se rved by SMH. Partici pants in community engagement activities conducted as part of the HASD&IC and SMH 2022 CHNAs identified numerous barriers to care for chronic conditions that have been exacerbated by the COVID -19 pandemic, including: fear of contracting COVID -19; social is olation; high prescription and insurance costs; insurance conflicts; eligibility requirements for appropriate programs; and hardships related to housing. Data analysis in Sharp's 2022 CHNAs revealed a higher volume of hospital dischar ges for CVD in commu nities within SDC facing greater socioeconomic challenges.346 Participants in the interviews conducted by community health workers and promotor es as part of the HASD&IC 2022 CHNA identified heart disease and stroke as a major health concern among community members. Analysis of Sharp clinical data from FY 2016 to 2021 showed a 15% increase in stroke diagnoses among hospital inpatients, demonstratin g the impact of patients delaying care due t o the COVID -19 pandemic. In addition, the ratio of stroke deaths observed at Sharp hospitals in 2021 was 9% higher than expected when compared to 2016. Further, unpredictability during the COVID -19 pandemic has caused delays or disrupted access to routine and specialty care. This makes receiving comprehensive care even more challenging for people living with chronic health conditions. HASD&IC 2022 CHNA community engagement participants also identified the follow ing hospital discharge challenges and barrie rs for patients, including those with chronic conditions ; low health literacy and medication adherence; lack of access to stable housing to facilitate healing and recovery; and long wait times to access the appro priate level of care. In 2020, cerebrovascu lar diseases including stroke were the fourth leading cause of death in SDC, accounting for 1,722 deaths.343,344 In 2019, there were 6,500 hospitalizations for str oke in SDC. The age -adjusted rate of hospitalizations for stroke was 177.5 per 100,000 population. In 2019, there were 2,828 stroke -related ED visits in SDC. The age -adjusted rate of ED visits was 76.7 per 100,000 population. Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 290 According to 2021 CHIS data, 26.1% of SDC residents had ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure, while 6.7% had borderline high blood pressure. In addition, 21.7% of SDC adults reported being obese.342 According to the CDC, more than 795,000 people in the U.S. have a stroke each year, and strokes are responsible for approximately 1 out of every 6 deaths from CVD .354 The Nati onal Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke reports that 25% of people who recover from their first stroke will have another stroke within five years.355 The CDC estimates that up to 80% of strokes are preventable through the recognition of early s igns/symptoms and the elimination of stroke risk factors. Behaviors that can mitigate the risk of stroke include ch oosing a healthy diet full of fruits and vegetables, maintaining a healthy weight, engaging in at least 2.5 hours of moderate -intensity aerob ic physical activity each week, refraining from or quitting smoking and limiting alcohol intake.356 Despite encourag ing data about declining stroke incidence, on a global level the aging population and accumulating risk factors contribute to an increasing lifetime risk of stroke.357 Objective Provide stroke education, support and screening services for the central regi on of SDC FY 202 2 Report of Activities SMH is certified by the Joint Commission and the American Heart Association ( AHA )/ American Stroke Association (ASA) as a Primary Stroke Center (re -certified in December 2021 ). The program is nationally recognized f or its outreach, education and thorough screening procedures, as well as documentation of its success rate. SMH is also a r ecipient of AHA/ASA's Get With The Guidelines\u00ae (GWTG) \u2014 Stroke Silver Plus Quality Achievement Award for excellence in stroke care, a s well as the Target: Stroke Elite Honor Roll designation. The AHA/ASA's GWTG is a national effort focused on ensuring the use of evidence -based therapies to improve outcomes for stroke patien ts. The AHA/ASA's Target: Stroke Elite Honor Roll designation fo cuses on improving the timeliness of intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV t -PA) administration to eligible patients. In addition, the SMH Rehabilitation Center is accredited by CARF (Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities) Interna tional for its stroke specialty program, which represents the highest level of accreditation that can be awarded to an organization. Although Sharp's systemwide stroke program and SMH's Strok e Program planned to participate in numerous screening and educa tional events in FY 202 2, events were either canceled or postponed due to the COVID -19 pandemic. Despite these 354 CDC (2022), Stroke Facts. 355 National I nstitute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (2022), Stroke. 356 CDC (2022), Men and Str oke. 357 American Heart Association (2022), U.S. stroke rate declining in adults 75 and older, yet rising in adults 49 and younger . Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 291 circumstances, efforts were made to bring virtual stroke education to the communi ty. In partnership with Sharp's marketing team, the systemwide s troke program shared information about stroke and atrial fibrillation through Sharp's social media channels and more . Building off its successful implementation in FY 2021, this virtual commun ity education had an expansive reach, connecting with more than 17,000 individuals in FY 2022. As of July 2022, stroke education in the community resumed with increased involvement by Sharp's systemwide stroke program staff in health fairs and community events focused on heart and brain health. In September, SMH's Stro ke Program and ED staff participated in a fall prevention and balance screening event at the Grossmont Healthcare District (GHD) , where they provided fall prevention education and resources for seniors to nearly 70 attendees. The SMH Rehabilitation Cente r continued to provide meeting space for Young Enthusiastic Stroke Survivors (YESS), a free monthly support group for survivors of stroke and head injuries and their loved ones, as well as professionals and educators. The group offered support, guest speak ers, adaptive exercise classes and opportunities to socialize. In FY 202 2, YESS reached approximately 200 attendees and connecte d with approximately 700 survivors, family members and health professionals through its mailing list. SMH continued its 1 7-year collaboration with the County of San Diego E mergency Medical Services (EMS ) to provide data for the SDC stroke registry, where data is tracked to identify gaps and determine trends. SMH also continued to actively participate in the quarterly San Diego Cou nty Stroke Consortium, a collaborative effort with other SDC hospitals to improve stroke care and discuss issues impacting strok e care in SDC. The San Diego County Stroke Consortium consists of 18 hospitals \u2014 including SMH, Sharp Coronado Hospital and Healt hcare Center , Vista Medical Center , Sharp Grossmont Hospital , Alvarado Hospital Medical Center, Kaiser San Diego Med ical Center, Kaiser Zion Medical Center, Palomar Medical Center, Paradise Valley Hospital, Scripps Memorial Hospital Encinitas, Scripps Memorial Hospital La Jolla, Scripps Mercy Hospital Chula Vista, Scripps Mercy Hospital San Diego, Temecula Valley Hospit al, Tri -City Medical Center, UC San Diego Medical Center, and UC San Diego Medical Center - La Jolla \u2014 all of which are San Dieg o County Stroke Receiving Centers and certified by the Joint Commission. In response to the COVID -19 pandemic, meetings continue d to be held virtually in FY 202 2. Sharp's systemwide stroke program continued to partner with the San Diego County Stroke Con sortium to develop educational materials, including training videos, for AMR (American Medical Response) San Diego, a medical tr ansportation company that assists with emergency and non -emergency transportation. In November, this included a video addressing the topics of new stroke procedures and guidelines, and how to assess a stroke patient at the scene. Further, Sharp's systemwide stroke program continues to participate in the development of EMS protocol updates. Sharp's systemwide stroke program also c ollaborated wi th San Diego County Stroke Consortium hospitals in FY 2022 to help alleviate community concerns related to Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 292 obtaining health care during the COVID -19 pandemic. Using social media, the hospitals released a message encouraging San Diegans not to delay seeking care during the pandemic. Each message sent from Sharp reached 16,000 subscribers on Facebook, Instagram and other Sharp -associated social media outlets. FY 202 3 Plan SMH Stroke Program will do the following:358 Provide stroke screening an d education a t events in SDC, including events for seniors and vulnerable adults Provide stroke education, screening and outreach to community members via social media and in person classes Provide a community presentation on stroke education and preventio n featuring a Sharp -affiliated physician Provide education for individuals with identified stroke risk factors Offer stroke support groups through the SMH Rehabilitation Center Participate in the San Diego County Stroke Consortium Participate in annual E MS education, with a focus on Large Vessel Occlusion, or blockages of the proximal intracranial anterior and posterior circulation, identification in the field Provide data to the SDC stroke registry Identified Community Need: Health Education, Screening , Support and Resources for Aging Care & Support Rationale references the findings of the SMH 2022 CHNA, HASD&IC 2022 CHNA or the most recent SDC community health statistics unless otherwise indicated. Rationale The HASD&IC and SMH 2022 CHNAs identified issues that affect care and support during the aging process as a priority health and social needs affecting the community members served by SMH. Within this need, the following themes were identified: economic stability and risk of homelessness; social is olation; access to health care; access to community resources and support; behavioral health; stigma; and other health and safety concerns. A primary theme across HASD&IC's community engagement activit ies was economic instability among seniors. Financial stability was identified as a significant barrier to aging at home with dignity, and seniors may experience health impacts related to the unaffordability of necessary home modifications or equipment. HASD&IC secondary data identified several factors that c ontribute to poverty among seniors: limited income; chronic health conditions; disability; and loss of a significant 358 Where applicable, the SMH Stroke Program will perform these activities as COVID -19 public health and safety gu idelines allow. Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 293 other. Low -income seniors may be dependent on public programs like Medi -Cal and cash assistance (Supplemental Security Income) to make ends meet. The Institute for Public Health's ( IPH) Sharp Provider Survey conducted as part of the SMH 2022 CHNA identified increased isolation among seniors as one of the top clinical and social needs most seriously impacted by COVID -19 in the past year. Sharp Insight Community Survey respondents ages 65 and older reported experiencing a decrease in access to social support, healthy food, transportation and community resources as a result of COVID -19. Participants identified caregivers of adults or older adul ts as the leading population impacted by COVID in relation to increased isolation in seniors/older adults, increased anxiety and depression, and decreased access to behavioral health care. Survey partic ipants suggested the following strategies to address i ncreased isolation among seniors/older adults: finding ways to allow visitation during COVID -19; establishing or expanding home visiting and other follow -up services; expanding or resuming services for seniors; offering more patient education and referrals ; improving access to technology; and providing support for caregivers. According to hospital data presented in the SMH 2022 CHNA, seniors represented 48.1% of all inpatient discharges and 22.3% of ED encounters at SMH in 2020. In addition, seniors repre sented 47.0% of inpatient discharges for unintentional injury at SMH, with fall -related injuries occurring in 47.3% of those discharges. Seniors also represented 68.6% of inpatient discharges with an os teoarthritis diagnosis. Data analysis also found that nearly a third (30.3%) of seniors admitted to SMH had a behavioral health diagnosis, with 40.8% diagnosed with a depressive disorder and 28.6% with an anxiety and fear -related disorder. In 2019, the top 10 leading causes of death among adults age s 65 and older in SDC were (in rank order): diseases of the heart, cancer, Alzheimer's disease, cerebrovascular diseases (including stroke), chronic lower respiratory diseases, diabetes, accidents/unintentiona l injuries, essential hypertension and hypertensive renal disease, Parkinson's disease, and influenza or pneumonia.343 In 2019, hospitalization rates among seniors were higher than the general population due to coronary heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pul monary disease, nonfatal unintentional injuries (including falls), cancer and arthritis.347 The top three causes of ED utilization among SDC residents ages 65 and older in 2019 were unintentional injuries, fall s and overall heart disease. In 2021, the top five need s for 2 -1-1 clients ages 60 and older were (in rank order): housing, utilities, income support and employment, consumer services, and health care.359 The CDC reports that three million older adults are t reated in the ED for falls every year. One in five fal ls causes a serious injury, such as broken bones or a head injury, and each fall doubles the chance of falling again. Fall injuries may result in serious mobility issues and difficulty with everyday tas ks or living independently.360 Assuming current trends continue, by 2030, nearly 115,000 SDC residents 55 years and older will be living with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias, representing a 36.5% increase from 2015.361 359 2-1-1 San Diego (2 -1-1) (2022), Data Dash board. 360 CDC (2021), Facts About Falls . 361 County of San Diego HHSA, PHS, CHSU (2018), Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias in San Diego County . Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 294 According to the California Dep artment of Aging, 11.0% of SDC residents age 60 and older were low -income in 2021, and 18.1% were eligible for Medi -Cal. In addition, 17.1% of SDC seniors were identified as living alone.362 The Caregiving in the U.S. 2020 report estimates that 16.8% (41.8 million) of Americans care for an adult age 50 and older, an increase from 14.3% in 2015. Caregiving prevalence has increased among all racial/ethnic groups, educational levels, work statuses, genders, and nearly all generations.363 The 2022 National Strate gy to Support Family Caregivers report pro poses five main goals to support family caregivers: increase awareness and outreach; build partnerships and engagement with family caregivers; strengthen services and supports; ensure financial and workplace securi ty; and expand data, research, and evidenc e-based practices related to family caregiving.364 According to a report titled Burning the Candle at Both Ends: Sandwich Generation Caregiving in the U.S. , sandwich caregivers \u2014 those who provide unpaid care to an adult while also caring for children in t heir home \u2014 account for 28% of all caregivers. Sandwich caregivers often juggle work and caregiving responsibilities, and report high levels of emotional stress and physical or financial strain.365 Research published in Health Affairs indicates that lack of access to technology, low digital health literacy, and design barriers in patient portals and apps have disproportionately affected older adults during the COVID -19 pandemic, especially those in underserved communit ies.366 Objectives Provide a variety of senior health education and screening programs Provide education and community resources to seniors and family caregivers Maintain and grow partnerships with community organizations to expand community outreach and provide seniors and caregivers with updated information on available services and resources FY 202 2 Report of Activities The Sharp Senior Resource Centers meet the unique needs of seniors and their caregivers by connecting them to a variety of free and l ow-cost programs and services through phone and in -person consultations. The Sharp Senior Resource Centers' compassionate s taff and volunteers provide personalized support and clear, accurate information regarding health education and screenings, community referrals and caregiver resources. In FY 2022, the SMH Senior Resource Center held two educational classes at the Point Loma Community Presbyterian Church in collaboration with other Sharp services and 362 California Department of Aging (CDA) (2022), 2022 CDA Population Demographic Projections for Intrastate Funding Formula . 363 National Alliance for Caregiving ( NAC ) (2020), in the U.S. 2020 . 364 NAC (2022), 2022 National Strategy to Support Family Caregivers . 365 NAC (2019), Burning the Candle at Both Ends: Sandwich Generation Caregiving in the U.S. 366 Fulmer, T., Reuben, D.

Topics included fall prevention and diabetes and nearly twenty atten dees participated in the classes. The SMH Senior Resource Center opted not to reinstate community health screenings in FY 2022 due to pandemic -related concerns. In FY 2022, the SMH Senior Resource Center provided informational handouts about local communi ty resources and refer red community members to these organizations as needed. Outreach was provided to various groups, including geriatric hospital inpatients , community members attending SMH Senior Resource Center community events and visitors of the Cush man Wellness Center Community Health Library . The SMH Senior Resource Center also provided the Cushman Wellness Center Community Heal th Library and the Point Loma Community Presbyterian Church with informational handouts to distribute to seniors and their caregivers about various community resources , including County of San Diego Aging and Independence Services (AIS) , San Diego Oasis, A lzheimer's San Diego, ElderHelp of San Diego, Jewish Family Services of San Diego (JFS) , County of San Diego Behavioral Health Services, Caregiver Coalition, County of S an Diego Adult Protective Services and the Southern Caregiver Resource Center. In Nove mber, the SMH Senior Resource Center donated 300 Vial of Life placards to Stone Ridge Estates senior living community in Warner Springs . Vials of Life are small vinyl sl eeves that can be magnetically affixed onto a refrigerator to provide emergency personn el with critical medical information for seniors and people with disabilities . The donation helped Stone Ridge Estates address challenges with verifying the identity of residents in need of medical care and who to call in an emergency. The Vials of Life are also available to community members through the Cushman Wellness Center Community Health Library as well as through offsite Sharp events focused on aging care and support . To keep the public informed about pertinent health news as well as upcoming commu nity education classes and support groups , the SMH Senior Resource Center produced and distributed a quarterly newsletter to San Diego households . The newsletter promotes the hours, location and resources of the Cushman Wellness Center Community Health Lib rary, available to all members of the public. Each quarter in FY 2022, the library mailed approximately 420 Wellness Connection newsletters and delivered over 270 electronically. The SMH Senior Resource Center has also supported efforts to increase techno logy literacy among the senior community. In FY 2021, the SMH Senior Resource Center distributed a technology survey that was completed by 50 senior community member s through the Cushman Wellness Center Community Health Library, SMH Senior Health Center an d the Gary and Mary West Senior Wellness Center in Downtown San Diego to guide future education and support for seniors as well as help them connect with one another virtually. In FY 2022, the Community Health Librarian & Senior Resource Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 296 Liaison at SMH con nected with staff at the San Diego Oasis Tech Tank to develop a strategy to support technology training for the senior community. Throughout the year, the SMH Senior Resource Center maintained active relationships with numerous community organizations, i ncluding Peninsula Shepherd Senior Center, Serving Seniors (including Potiker Family Senior Residence and Gary and Mary West Senior Wellness Center), Bayside Community Center, Westminster Manor (senior housing), JFS, Caregiver Coalition, County of San Dieg o AIS, Adult Protective Services, Southern Caregiver Resource Center, Alzheimer's San Diego, San Diego Community Action Network, SDC COA , National Active and Retired Federal Employees Association, Community Center for the Blind and Visually Impaired, Cabril lo Credit Union Supervisory Committee, Point Loma/Hervey Library, San Diego Square, St. Paul's PACE (Program of All -Inclusive Care f or the Elderly), St. Peter's by the Sea Lutheran Church, Downtown San Diego Silvercrest Residence and Health Insurance Couns eling & Advocacy Program. In FY 2022 , many organizations continued to meet virtually in response to the COVID -19 pandemic. FY 2023 Plan The SMH Senior Resource Center will do the following:367 Develop and support programs to meet the needs of older adult s (digital literacy, mental health, safety and equity) in partnership with local community organizations Provide information, resou rces and support to address concerns of community seniors and caregivers Provide community health information and resources t hrough educational programs Provide planning, coordination, and resources for Sharp's Health Education Lecture Series for older adults and their caregivers in Point Loma; seek additional funding to expand the series to other locations Produce and distribu te quarterly newsletters to S an Diego households, highlighting events of interest to seniors and family caregivers Provide Vials of Life to community seniors Participate in and coordinate community health events and conferences, including virtual events Participate in aging conferenc es for seniors Maintain active relationships with organizations that serve seniors in north coastal, north central, central and south regions Serve as a resource for senior health and well -being through various media sources Connect with a variety of commu nity partners to develop a strategy to support technology training for the senior community 367 Where applicable, the SMH Senior Resource Ce nter will perform these activities as COVID -19 public health and safety guidelines allow. Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 297 Identified Community Need: Health Education, Support and Wellness Rationale references the findings of the SMH 2022 CHNA, HASD&IC 2 022 CHNA or the most recent SDC community health statistics unless otherwise indicated. Rationale The HASD&IC and SMH 2022 CHNAs identified access to health care, aging care & support, behavioral health, children & youth well -being, chronic health condit ions, community safet y, and economic stability as the priority health and social needs affecting the community members served by SMH. In addition, maternal and prenatal care, including high -risk pregnancy, were identified in the SMH 2022 CHNA as priority h ealth needs. HASD&IC 's community engagement efforts described health literacy as a barrier in accessing health care. To help people understand basic health information, there is a need for more education on preventive health care, healthy lifestyles, and understanding the dif ferences between sources of care (e.g., when to use urgent care v ersus the emergency room). Participants noted that health care settings should use simple, plain language forms to help people understand health information. Also accord ing to the HASD&IC 20 22 CHNA, the pandemic further exacerbated existing health literacy challenges, such as people not understanding their health insurance benefits, not knowing whom to call to access services, and difficulty identifying where to get care. Data analysis in S harp's 2022 CHNAs revealed a higher volume of hospital discharges due to CVD and Type 2 diabetes in communities facing greater socioeconomic challenges throughout SDC.346 In 2020, cancer w as the leading cause of death in SDC, followed by diseases of the heart and COVID -19. 343,344 According to 2021 CHIS data, 26.1% of SDC residents had ever been diag nosed with high blood pressure, while 6.7% had borderline high blood pressure. In addition, 21.7% of SDC adults reported being obese.342 In California, th e self -reported obesity rate in 2021 was 27.6%. Prevalen ce of obesity decreases as education levels increase, highlighting the need for health education as a tool for reducing obesity rates.368 A study published in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly suggests that risks of COVID -19-related hospitalization, ICU, admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, and death are higher with increasing body mass index, particularly among adults under the age of 65.369 According to the CDC, the lea ding causes of preventable death include obesity - related conditions, such a s heart disease, stroke, Type 2 diabetes and some types of cancer.370 According to the article Social and Environmental Factors Influencing Obesity , obesity prevalence is significant ly associated with gender, racial or ethnic identity, 368 CDC (2022), Adult Obesity Prevalence Maps . 369 Kompaniyets L, Goodman AB, Belay B, et al. (2021 ), Body Mass Index and Risk for COVID -19-Related Hospitalization, Intensive Care Unit Admission, Invasive Mechanical Ventilation, and Death \u2014 United States, March -December 2020.

Higher odds of obesity are attributed to multiple factors, including environments experi encing deprivation, disorder, or high crime; proliferation of high calorie, energy -dense food options that are perceived as more affordable; and reductions in occup ational and transportation -related physical activity .371 In 2021, 29.5% of SDC residents living below 200% of the federal poverty line reported enrollment in the CalFresh program.342 According to the CDC, more th an 53 million people in the U.S. either already have osteoporosis or are at high risk due to low bone mass .372 Along with the financial costs, osteoporosis can reduce quality of life for many people who suffer from fractures. It can also affect the lives of family members and friends who serve as caregivers. Preventable risk factors for osteoporosis include smo king, alcohol consumption, and medication and vitamin intake.373 According to the National Institutes of Health ( NIH) National Library of Medicine, nearl y 9 out of 10 U.S. adults struggle with health literacy, which involves the information and services that people need to make well -informed health decisions. Limited health literacy is associated with poor health outcome s, including hospital stays and ED v isits; medication errors; difficulty managing chronic diseases; and skipping preventive services, such as flu vaccines.374 The NIH National Library of Medicine suggests the following strategies for improving heath literac y: ensuring that community members ca n easily access health information, providing plain language health materials in different languages, training health professionals about health literacy best practices, creating clearinghouses of health literacy inform ation for health professionals, and r eviewing health materials (like insurance forms and medication instructions) with community members to help make sure they understand the information.374 The NIH National Center for Complementary and Integrativ e Health describes integrative health as a way to bring conventional and complementary health care approaches together in a coordinated way. Integrative he alth also emphasizes multimodal interventions \u2014 combinations of various interventions such as convent ional medicine, lifestyle changes, physical rehabilitation, psychotherapy, and complementary health approaches \u2014 with an emphasis on treating the whole person.375 According to the Mayo Clinic, integrative medicine can help people with cancer, persistent pain , chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia and many other conditions to better manage their symptoms and improve their quality of life by reducing fatigue, pain and anxiety. Examples of common practices include acupuncture, animal -assisted therapy, aromatherapy, diet ary supplements, massage therapy, music therapy and meditation.376 371 Lee A., Cardel M., & Donahoo W.T.

Integrative medicine classes off ered in -person, virtual and recorded meeting options in FY 2022 and served approximately 30 participants. SMH als o connected with approximately 225 community members each month through its integrative medicine class email list. Support groups provided an outlet for community members to share their personal experiences and advice for coping with various challenges, i ncluding cancer, breastfeeding, postpartum mood disorders, and nutrition and support following bariatric surgery . Sharp Rehab also hosted free support groups, including groups for stroke survivors, individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI), and those recov ering from the physical or cognitive effects of a past COVID -19 diagnosis. The YESS support group focused on educating the community about str oke and the effects of stroke on young people and their families. The group offered guest speakers, adaptive exer cise classes, social meetings and support meetings. Serving not only stroke survivors, but also adults with head injuries, family members, prof essionals and educators, YESS reached approximately 200 participants in FY 2022, which included SMH's virtual sup port group meetings and virtual adaptive exercise classes. In addition, YESS connected with approximately 700 survivors, family members and hea lth Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 300 professionals through its mailing list. Offered monthly through Zoom, the Women's SCI support group served ap proximately 10 individuals each session in FY 2022 as well as an email network of 25 community members. Topics of discussion in FY 2022 include d pain management, advocating for oneself in the medical setting, weight management, and traveling in a wheelchai r, among others . A twice monthly, post -COVID -19 group supported community members living with residual health issues from a prior COVID -19 diagnosis, including pulmonary issues, balance/vestibular problems, cognitive challenges and pain. The group provide d members the oppo rtunity to share how they are doing as well as propose personal topics of interest to discuss. In FY 2022, discussions included but were not limited to COVID -19 and the five stages of grief, the importance of self -pacing as a recovery strategy, mindfulness , and the spoon theory \u2014 a metaphor to help individuals living with chronic pain express how health issues impact their ability to complete daily activities. The group served between three and seven attendees each session in FY 2022, and through a class su rvey, was reported by participants as enjoyable and of interest for continuation. In April, Sharp Rehab's neuropsychology and speech therapy teams launched a new Long -Haul COVID -19 Cognitive Skills class. The six -week, online series is de signed for individ uals with cognitive difficulties related to post -acute sequalae of COVID -19, commonly known as long -haul COVID -19. Participants learn about a variety of mental strategies and external aids to help manage problems with memory, attention, o rganization and ot her thinking skills. Although th is new series is provided for a fee, SMH waives the cost for community members who cannot afford to pay. In addition, in September Sharp Rehab joined Sharp Lends a Hand to sponsor They Will Surf Again, a s ignature event of the Life Rolls On Foundation \u2014 a nonprofit organization dedicated to improving the quality of life for people affected by SCI. During the event, Sharp Rehab team members helped more than 20 individuals who normally use wheelchairs to expe rience the thrill of surfing with the help of special equipment and volunteers. The OPP houses the Cushman Wellness Center Community Health Library, which provides access to a range of resources in various languages to help patients and community members locate reliable h ealth information. The library is led by a consumer health librarian with specialized training in community health as well as a store manager with expertise in health -related gifts, assistive devices and community health resources. In add ition to DVDs, CDs , books, pamphlets and access to the internet, the library provides an online collection of health and wellness eBooks, audio books and e - Magazines that can be accessed by community members both on and offsite. In addition, the library pu blishes and distri butes a quarterly newsletter to keep the public informed about pertinent health news and upcoming community education classes and support groups. Each quarter in FY 2022, the library mailed approximately 420 newsletters and delivered more than 270 electron ically. Community members can learn about the Cushman Wellness Center Community Health Library through sharp.com and Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 301 may contact the consumer health librarian by email, phone or through the library's webpage. The library also serves as an informational res ource for all Sharp entities. In May, SMH staff participated in the annual Sharp Women's Health Conference . Staff from a variety of hospital departments provided attendees with education and resources on a range of health and lifestyle t opics, including: available cancer support services at SMH; diabetes prevention, care and risk assessment; evaluation and recommendations for hand pain and discomfort; body composition screenings; chair massage and acupuncture; musculoskeletal screenings, walking and footwe ar assessments, and education on posture; and information on women's pelvic health, including screening questionnaires for pelvic health dysfunction. SMH provided a variety of community education and support for cardiovascular health in FY 2022. The hos pital hosted several free webinars throughout the year about heart - related health conditions, including four webinars on atrial fibrillation, two on heart failure treatment, and two on heart valve disease. During these events, SMH -affilia ted cardiovascular surgeons and other heart specialists discussed risk factors, symptoms, diagnosis, and the latest treatment options for these conditions, as well as provided question -and-answer sessions. SMH also raised awareness about cardiovascular health through Facebo ok during American Heart Month in February. As a local sponsor of the AHA 's signature women's movement, Go Red for Women, SMH posted information about the signs and symptoms of a heart attack; lifestyle changes to reduce the risk for hear t disease; the imp ortance of early detection of CVD to prevent maternal death, especially in Black women; the increased risk of women with a history of heart - related health issues develop ing dementia or issues with cognition or memory; and the increased li kelihood of Hispan ic women developing heart disease earlier than non - Hispanics. In addition, SMH provided coordination, support and related fundraising activities for the 2022 San Diego Heart & Stroke Walk. In FY 2022, SMH participated in opportunities t o promote community safety. In March, team members from the Prehospital EMS department hosted a first aid station at the two-day San Diego Crew Classic rowing event where they provi ded competitors and attendees with blood pressure checks and treatment for minor injuries. In May, trauma center staff participated in the California Highway Patrol's Every 15 Minutes program. The two -day event included a simulated drunk driving motor vehicle accident to raise awareness among students at Steele Canyon High School in Spring Valley about personal safety and how their choices affect the lives of others. SMH supported the event by supplying the hospital's helipad and emergency room to treat the st aged victims as well as by filming portions of the event and speaking to the students. In September, trauma center staff participated in the Fall Prevention & Balance Screening event at the GHD in collaboration with the SGH Senior Resource Center, SGH Reha bilitation Services and GHD. The free event provided fall prevention awa reness, exercise and movement demonstrations, a health fair, and a variety of other resources for approximately 70 community seniors. Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 302 In addition, SMH trauma center staff provided fr ee community trainings on STOP the Bleed, a national awareness campaign to train, equip and empower bystanders to assist in a bleeding emergency before professional help arrives. Trainings were held at the Lemon Grove Rod and Gun Club in July and at Standl ey Park in University City in September. Through these trainings in FY 2 022, 35 community members learned how to properly assess and control a hemorrhage (blood loss) and apply a tourniquet, as well as received STOP the Bleed certification upon successful course completion. In FY 2022, SMH shared education on a variety of he alth and wellness topics through the hospital's Facebook page and Sharp Health News. Topics included signs and symptoms of mild traumatic brain injury (TBI); the importance of getting quality sleep; the benefits of adaptive yoga for a range of disabilities ; facts about Paxlovid medication for the treatment of COVID -19; facts about tobacco products and the risk of lung cancer; and dietary tips to improve bone density and prevent osteopor osis. SMH also used its Facebook page to raise awareness of important he alth and social issues throughout the year, including mental health; traumatic injury prevention, including violence prevention and promoting peace in the community; diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging and support for the LGBTQ+ community; Juneteent h; organ transplantation; fall prevention; stroke; speech disorders; and various cancers including breast, colorectal, lung, brain, and oral, head and neck cancers. In addi tion, in FY 2022, SMH's health and wellness education was featured in se veral local media outlets including The San Diego Union -Tribune , CBS News 8, NBC - 7 San Diego , KUSI News, 10News - ABC San Diego KGTV and Fox 5 San Diego. In 2020, SMH created the SMH Family Resource Center (FRC) as part of its community response to the COVID -19 pandemic. Built as a massive tent structure outside of the ED, the hospital built the FRC immediately following the outbreak to help connect family members to their hospitalized loved ones during mandatory visitor restrictions. The FRC quickly ev olved into a place of support for the broader community, including individuals searching for family and friends at other hospitals and those seeking informati on about COVID -19 testing and treatment. The SMH FRC continues to support patients, visitors and c ommunity members with their COVID -19-related concerns, as well as provides general assistance and connection to other health and hospital resources as request ed. Since its launch in 2020, the SMH FRC has addressed the needs of tens of thousands of San Dieg ans. FY 2023 Plan SMH will do the following:377 Provide community education classes and support groups on a variety of topics , including health and socia l needs identified in the SMH 2022 CHNA Develop and distribute quarterly newsletters to inform the community of health education and screening opportunities 377 Where applicable, SMH will perform these activities as COVID -19 public health and safety guidelines allow. Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 303 Provide community health and wellness clinics (flu shots, blood pressure checks, memory screening) Provide free STOP the Bleed trainings to community members throughout SDC Provide coordination, s upport and fundraising activities for local nonprofit organizations Offer support to community members through the SMH FRC Identified Community Need: Cancer Education and Support, and Participation in Clinical Trials Rationale references the findings of the SMH 2022 CHNA, HASD&IC 2022 CHNA or the most recent SDC community health statistics unless otherwise indicated. Rationa le The HASD&IC and SMH 2022 CHNAs identified chronic health conditions, including cancer, as one of the priority health and social needs affecting the community members served by SMH. Focus groups conducted as part of the HASD&IC 2022 CHNA described the following challenges related to accessing cancer care: delayed or disrupted access to cancer screenin g during the COVID -19 pandemic ; financial stressors, including the cost of health insurance premiums and co -pays; stigma surrounding a cancer diagnosis; and practical issues to facilitate healing and recovery, such as housing and transportation. In additio n, undocumented community memb ers with cancer were described as being at a severe disadvantage, as many lack the necessary insurance coverage to enroll in programs and services that could provide financial, logistical and other supportive needs. Data analysis in the SMH 2022 CHNA revea led a higher volume of hospital discharges due to cancer in communities within SDC facing greater socioeconomic challenges.346 Participants in the interviews conducted by community health workers and promotor es as part of the HASD&IC 2022 CHNA identified cancer as a major health concern among community members. Analysis of Sharp patient data from FY 2016 to 2021 sho wed a significant decline in cancer screening volumes during the pandemic. Further analysis is nee ded to assess the impact of the pandemic on screening and oncology patient volumes. Participants in the IPH Sharp Provider Survey conducted as part of the SMH 2022 CHNA process reported that patients are more fearful \u2014 in general and of coming in for annua l cancer screenings. In addition, due to the pandemic, respondents identified populations appropriate for cancer screenings as having increased fear related t o using health care services. Sharp cancer patient navigators and clinical social workers who pa rticipated in focus groups noted that cancer patients may have limited access to specialty care because health care professionals are overwhelmed. Sharp works with cancer specialists across the system to improve access within and among various practices. Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 304 The most frequently observed cancers at SMH in 2021 were (in rank order): breast (18.1%), prostate colorectal cancer (5.1%). In total, there were 2,675 new cases of cancer at SMH in 2021. According to 2021 Sharp oncology data, 54.5% of the 1,127 SMH cancer patients who received the cancer psychosocial distress screening were identified as at -risk for anxiety or depression, and were referred to internal or external re sources, such as social workers or community cancer resources. Sharp 2021 oncology data identified the top 10 areas of concern for Sharp cancer patients : health insurance or money worries; worrying about the future and what lies ahead; pain; exercising an d being physically activ e; feeling too tired; worrying about family, children or friends; changes/disruptions in work; sleep; making a treatment decision; and feeling nervous. In 2020, cancer was the leading cause of death for SDC residents and was respo nsible for 20.1% of all deaths .343,344 There were 5,018 deaths due to cancer (all types) in SDC in 2019. The age -adjusted rate of death due to cancer was 135.2 deat hs per 100,000 population in SDC. In 2019, 16.9% of all cancer deaths in SDC were due to lung cancer, 8.6% to colorectal cancer, 7.9% to pancreatic cancer, 7.6% to female breast cancer, 7.1% to prostate cancer, 6.4% to female reproductive cancers, 6.4% to liver cancer, and 3.8% each to brain cancer and leukemia. The American Cancer Society (ACS) estimates that in 2022, there will be 189,220 new cance r cases diagnosed and 60,970 cancer deaths in the state of California.379 According to findings from the ACS Cancer Facts & Figures 2022 report , older age and being female are the strongest risk factors for breast cancer. Potentially modifiable factors asso ciated with increased risk include weight gain after the age of 18 and/or being overweight or obese, menopaus al hormone therapy, alcohol consumption and physical inactivity.380 The same report indicates that people with lower socioeconomic status have highe r cancer death rates than those with higher socioeconomic status, regardless of demographic factors such as ra ce/ethnicity. Racial and ethnic disparities in the cancer burden largely reflect disproportionate poverty. Social inequalities, including communic ation barriers and provider/patient assumptions, can affect interactions between patients and physicians and c ontribute to miscommunication and/or delivery of substandard care.380 A recent study by the ACS found that at least 42% of newly diagnosed cancer cases in the U.S. \u2014 about 805,600 cases in 2022 \u2014 are potential ly avoidable. This includes the 19% of all cancers caused by tobacco use as well as the 18% caused by a combination o f excess body weight, alcohol consumption, poor nutrition and physical inactivity. 380 Studie s have shown that patient navigators contribute to be tter access and continuity of care, which offers a promising approach to better care integration. In cancer care, navigators help patients to move through the entire care continuum, 378 Cancers of the hematopoietic and reticuloendo thelial system include various malignancies that impact the blood and immune system, such as Hodgki n's and non -Hodgkin's lymphoma, leukemia and myeloma (Sharp Cancer Registry, 2020). 379 American Cancer Society ( ACS) Cancer Statistics Center (2022), California at a Glance. 380 ACS (2022), Cancer Facts & Figures 2022 . Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 305 from prevention to su rvivorship. Navigators typically identify individual needs and barriers to care, educating patients and communities, and linking patients with different care providers.381 According to the NIH, clinical trials, a part of clinical research, are at the heart o f all medical advances. Clinical trials explore new ways to prevent, detect or treat disease, and offer hope for many people as well as an opportunity to help researchers find better treatments for others in the future.382 Objectives Provide cancer educati on and support groups to patients and community members Provide cancer resources and education at community events Provide cancer patient navigation and support services to the community Participate in cancer clinical trials, includin g screening and enroll ing patients FY 2022 Report of Activities The Cancer Centers of Sharp HealthCare (Cancer Centers of Sharp) include the Laurel Amtower Cancer Institute at SMH, the David and Donna Long Center for Cancer Treatment at SGH, and the Doug las & Nancy Barnhart C ancer Center at SCVMC. The Cancer Centers of Sharp are accredited by the American College of Surgeons Commission on Cancer (CoC) as an Integrated Network Cancer Program (INCP), demonstrating Sharp's commitment to meeting rigorous stan dards and improving th e quality of care for patients with cancer. In addition, the Cancer Centers of Sharp have received APEx (Accreditation Program for Excellence) accreditation by the American Society for Radiation Oncology, in recognition of Sharp's ded ication to promoting effective communication and coordinated radiation oncology treatment, as well as engaging patients and their families as partners in care. The Laurel Amtower Cancer Institute includes the Neuro -Oncology Center and the Breast Health C enter, with designated licensed clinical social worker s (LCSW ), nurse patient navigators, genetic counselors, dietitians and clinical trials specialists who support and guide patients with cancer and their families from the time of diagnosis through the co urse of treatment. In FY 2022, LCSWs, as well as two student interns, provided free psychosocial counseling and support as well as referrals to community organizations to approximately 1,980 patients and family members. Nurse navigators provided ongoing gu idance for approximate ly 1,600 patients and families impacted by all cancer diagnoses, including but not limited to breast, head and neck, lung, pancreas, colorectal, testicular, gynecological, and brain and spinal tumors. This included assistance with app ointment scheduling; e xplanation of procedures and test results; provision of educational resources and supportive services; assistance with financial resources; and referrals to multiple community agencies, including , but not limited to: San Diego Homecar e, Mama's Kitchen, Mea ls on Wheels San Diego County, Food 381 European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies (in partnership with the WHO ) (2022).

In addition, the Cancer Centers of Sharp, including the Laurel Amtower Cancer Institute , partnered with ACS t o coordinate transportation at no cost for patients receiving cancer treatment, as well as provide patients with essential lodging services, as needed. In FY 2022, the Cancer Centers of Sharp \u2014 including SMH's Laurel Amtower Cancer Institute \u2014 continued to provide a variety of free support groups, educational classes and workshops, reaching more than 1,700 community members impacted by cancer. Programs were provided virtually throughout the year in response to the ongoing COVID -19 pandemic. The virtual fo rmat enabled the Cancer Centers of Sharp to expand their reach beyond community members in SDC to individuals located throughout the world. Support groups provided a safe environment for individuals impacted by cancer to discuss their experience and learn coping strategies. Monthly groups were offered for friends and family members of patients with cancer; patients and survivors of head and neck cancer; individuals living with a brain tumor or brain cancer and their family and caregivers; individuals who h ave finished or are nearing completion of their cancer treatment; and young patients living with cancer (ages 20 through early 40s), including a group for those in cancer stages 0 -3, and a group for young patients with advanced cancer. Additional support g roups were available twice per month, including a general cancer support group for individuals with any diagnosis at any stage, men living with cancer at any stage, and individuals living with advanced cancer, as well as morning and evening groups for indi viduals in breast cancer stages 0 -3, whether recently diagnosed, or going through treatment and beyond. Further, the Cancer Centers of Sharp offered a weekly Art and Chat support group for patients living with cancer, survivors and their loved ones, which included a combination of conversation and relaxing drawing methods to increase focus, creativity, self -confidence and personal well-being. Educational classes and webinars addressed various aspects of a cancer diagnosis, including mental and emotional w ell-being, nutrition, and more. Monthly Cancer and the Arts classes gave community members an outlet to cope through creativity and art. The monthly New Cancer Diagnosis webinar supported individuals with coping, adjusting and growing through their new can cer experience. The Nutrition and Breast Cancer Class and Nutrition Class: Before, During and After Cancer Treatment reinforced healthy eating habits for those with cancer. Further, the monthly Lunch and Learn Cancer Education series invited community memb ers, patients and families to hear from health experts about unique cancer -related topics, including cancer and sexuality; Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 307 communicating with one's health care team; communicating with loved ones; preparing for the worst while hoping for the best; humor an d cancer; care for the caregivers; self - care; stress management; the science of making healthy lifestyle changes; self -talk; talking to children about cancer; and cancer and aging. Nearly 400 individuals attended the Lunch and Learn Cancer Education webina rs in FY 2022, while recorded versions were shared with an additional 75 community members who were unable to participate live. In addition, the Cancer Centers of Sharp continued to hold free monthly classes on lymphedema \u2014 a condition that causes swelling due to damage or blockage in the lymphatic system. Led by a certified lymphedema therapist, the classes taught individuals who were at high risk of developing lymphedema about risk factors, prevention strategies, signs and symptoms, and treatment options for the condition. Participants also received educational and community resources, including a guide to local medical vendors to purchase a compression garment to help manage their condition. The Cancer Centers of Sharp also hosted a variety of workshops for cancer patients and their loved ones in FY 2022 . The weekly Relaxation Skills workshop offered breathing and other relaxation exercises, as well as guided meditations, to help reduce tension and stress in the body and mind and promote a sense of peace and well -being. Four additional workshops rotated monthly throughout the year. The Relaxation and Quieting the Mind workshop helped patients with cancer and their loved ones manage stress, anxiety and difficult emotions related to a cancer diagnosis, whil e the Scanxiety: Managing the Fear of Cancer Recurrence workshop assisted patients in understanding and managing anxiety related to tests and scans. The Chemo Brain Workshop: Improving Memory and Concentration as well as How to Help Someone with Chemo Brain - A Class for Loved Ones helped address memory problems related to chemotherapy and other cancer treatments. Further, the Managing Sleep and Fatigue workshop assisted patients with cancer and their loved ones with fatigue and sleep issues both during and after treatment. In addition , in FY 2022 the Cancer Centers of Sharp partnered with Sharp's advance care planning (ACP) team to provide free ACP webinars for patients and community members. Led by Sharp HospiceCare team members with specialized training i n ACP , the webinars helped participants identify their personal health care choices, communicat e their wishes to loved ones, and develop their advance health care directive . In FY 2022, the Laurel Amtower Cancer Institute collaborated with the Cancer Cen ters of Sharp to host two free, specialized online events for community members, patients, families and caregivers impacted by cancer. In October, more than 50 individuals attended a webinar titled Surviving Cancer: Thriving After a Diagnosis. The event featured presentations by Sharp oncology social workers and a dietitian on topics including thriving after a cancer diagnosis, nutrition and exercise for survivors, and cancer -related cognitive impairment. In addition, a Sharp -affiliated physician shared about her personal journey with breast cancer. In April, approximately 60 community members participated in the annual Brain Tumor Worksh op. During the virtual event, Sharp's cancer team members discussed their various roles in working with patients with brai n tumors and what to expect during the care process, as well as answered Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 308 participants' questions about diagnosis and treatment. In fur ther support of community members impacted by a brain tumor diagnosis, in May, a Laurel Amtower Cancer Institute team memb er presented virtually to more than 20 members of the San Diego Brain Tumor Foundation's community support group. Topics included unde rstanding a brain tumor diagnosis, coping strategies and resources to support caregivers. In May, the Cancer Centers of S harp, including the Laurel Amtower Cancer Institute, participated in the annual Sharp Women's Health Conference . Team members shared a variety of information d uring the event, including how to properly perform a breast -self exam and the importance of perfo rming this exam monthly, as well as available cancer support services at Sharp such as educational classes, and nutrition, social work and nurse navigation services. Approximately 650 community members participated in the conference in FY 2022. In FY 2022 , the Cancer Centers of Sharp launched a private Facebook group titled Sharp HealthCare Cancer Patient Community. This group was creat ed for cancer patient s and their loved ones to create a sense of community and connection as well as provide reliable info rmation, thoughtful content, live discussions, and a quick and easy way to view current program and service offerings. This Facebook p age has more than 150 participants who are able to access up -to-date and vetted information, as well as post about issues of concern related to themselves and others. Beginning in July 2021, the Cancer Centers of Sharp formed a taskforce to explore the development of a continuum of care for patients experiencing chemo brain, more formally known as cancer -related cognitive i mpairment. Building off the existing webinar for chemo brain, the group created a patient flow, from diagnosis onward , developing educ ational materials, an additional webinar for loved ones, one -on-one assessment and treatment by a Sharp speech language pa thologist, an eight -session class taught by the speech language pathologist and oncology social worker, and a mentor program for gradu ates. These two cohorts featured a total of 14 participants, who provided positive feedback on the experience and degree o f support they received. This continuum of care is the first of its kind in San Diego. From June to November 2021, Sharp's systemwide INCP participated on the ACS CoC's Plan-Do-Study -Act (PDSA ) clinical study titled Return to Cancer Screening. As a syste mwide effort, Sharp participated in this clinical study to increase the pre -pandemic screening rates for both breast and colorectal cancers by 10% and reduce the backlog in screenings caused by pandemic disruptions. Various departments implemented measures to bring patients in for screenings, which included social media campaigns, news stories , and personal outreach for booking appointments, mailings and reminders. Findings were reported in February 2022: Sharp's breast cancer screening goal reached 91% of the target and colorectal cancer screenings exceeded the goal, with 103% of target . Beginning in January, Sharp participated in a second PDSA clinical study with the CoC addressing smoking cessation as a means to improve patient cancer risk and treatment Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 309 outcomes. This study reviewed whether all newly diagnosed cancer patients are being asked about their smoking status and offered cessation resources as appropriate . The initial data collection suggested that Sharp providers are consistently asking this question during consultation appointments (99% of the time) but smoking cessation resources offered to patients varied and were inconsistent across the system. Sharp improved its process by creating a new, Sharp -branded patient resource to be shared with all cancer treatment providers. Final smoking cessation data will be collected and reported i n February 2023. For more than 20 years, the Clinical Oncology Research (COR) Department at Sharp has conducted clinical trials to facilitate the discovery of new and improved treatments for cancer patients and to enhance scientific knowledge for the larg er health and research communities. Sharp's COR program includes a balanced portfolio of industry - sponsored, investigator -initiated and NCI studies. These studies expl ore the efficacy and safety of novel cancer therapeutic agents or technologies to benefit the most common cancer types. NCI studies focus on optimizing the standard of care. Sharp's COR collaborates with 22 physician -investigators throughout SDC's south, e ast and central regions. This brings innovative treatments close to research participants ' homes and minimizes the travel time for their care and study participation. In FY 2022, the COR pre -screened 400 patients for participation in oncology clinical trials. As a result, 33 patients consented to participate in cancer research studies. Clinic al trials focused on multiple types of cancer, including but not limited to brain, breast, colon, head and neck, lung, lymphoma, pancreatic and prostate. Sharp is the only health care organization in SDC to be accredited by the Association for the Accredit ation of Human Research Protection Programs, demonstrating Sharp's commitment to rigorous standards for ethics, quality and protection for research participants. FY 2023 Plan The Laurel Amtower Cancer Institute at SMH will do the following:377 Provide a variety of virtual cancer support groups for community members, patients, families a nd caregivers Provide virtual educat ion classes and workshops on topics including nutrition, lymphedema and emotional well -being for patients and community members impacted by cancer Offer classes to address cognitive impairments related to cancer and canc er treatments Collaborate with the C ancer Centers of Sharp to provide virtual workshops on various cancer wellness topics, including Spanish -language options Continue to educat e and raise awareness amon g community members and physician s about low-dose computed tomography (CT) lung cancer sc reenings and lung nodule management Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 310 Provide cancer education and resources at community health fairs and events as permitted by COVID -19 public health guidelines Through philanthropic support, provide transportation services for patients with cancer in ne ed of assistance to and from treatment appointments Conduct clinical trials to discover cancer treatments and inform the broader health and research community Seek funding to support the Laurel Amtower Cancer Institute Participate in and provide fundraisin g for events to support cancer research in San Diego Implement a patient and family advisory counsel Provide the private Sharp HealthCare Cancer Patient Community Facebook group Identified Community Need: Prevention of Unintentional Injuries Rationale r eferences the SMH CHNA, HASD&IC 2022 CHNA or the most recent SDC community health statistics unless otherwise indicated. Rationale The HASD&IC and SMH 2022 CHNAs identified community safety as among the priority health and social nee ds affecting community members served by SMH. The HASD&IC and SMH 2022 CHNAs identified the following themes related to community safety in SDC: racism; viole nce and coercion; implications for high -risk trafficking; and hospital workforc e safety. HASD&IC 2022 CHNA community engagement participants emphasized the importance of a safe environment in which to live, exercise, or play. Concerns related to living in an unsafe neighborhood include lack of access to safe outdoor spaces, as well a s exposure to racism and bullying. These challenges impact people of all ages, but are of particular concern for children. In addition, clinicians and communi ty-based organizations shared concerns about increasing safety risks for children, including some that have been exacerbated by the COVID -19 pandemic. Virtual learning in schools created fewer opportunities for mandated reporters to identify incidents of d omestic violence and neglect, and children who were seen at hospitals seemed to have more serious injuries. In 2020, accidents (unintentional injuries) were the sixth leading cause of death for SDC overall.343,344 Unintentional injuries are one of the leading c auses of death for SDC resident s of all ages, regardless of gender, race or region. Unintentional injuries include the following: motor vehicle accidents, falls, pedestrian -related, firearms, fire/burns, drowning, explosions, poisoning (including drugs and alcohol, gas, cleaners and caustic substances), choking/suffocation, cutting/piercing, exposure to electrical current/radiation/fire/smoke, natural disasters and workplace injuries. Between 2015 and 2019, more than 5,800 San Diegans died from injuries tha t were not self -inflicted. In 2020, there were 1,513 deaths due to unintentional injury in SDC , accounted for 6.2% of all deaths countywide . Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 311 In 2019, there were 23,310 hospitalizations related to unintentional injury in SDC. The age -adjusted rate of hospi talizations due to unintentional injury was 650.9 per 100,000 population.347 In 2019, there were 173,014 ED visits related to unintentional injury in SDC. The age-adjusted rate of ED visits due to unintentional injury was 5,122.0 per 100,000 population. According to the County of San Diego Department of the Medical Examiner's 2021 Annual Report Executive Summary , more than half of sudden and unexpected deaths in SDC we re attributed to accidental causes, includin g poisoning, falls, traffic or train related injuries, drowning, asphyxiation or environmental exposure. The number of deaths attributed to accidental causes increased 22.2% from 2020 to 2021.383 According to Childhood Unintentional Injuries in San Diego Cou nty: A report to the community , the COVID -19 pandemic has led to changes in the types of injuries that were most often experienced by children and youth. With stay -at-home orders, families were contained in thei r homes and unintentional injuries in the hom e, like window falls, led to hospitalizations in greater numbers than expected. As families spent more time outside, hospitals experienced an increase in all-terrain vehicle crashes and an unexpected increase in drownings \u2014 primarily in backyard pools.384 California Department of Public Health and HCAI injury data indicates that, in 2020, unintentional injuries caused more than 1,500 deaths, nearly 130,000 million ED visits, and more than 27,500 hospitalizations in SDC336,385 In 2020, unintentional injury was the fourth leading cause of death across all age groups in the U.S., accounting for nearly 201,000 deaths. Unintentional injury was the leading cause of death in the U.S. for people ages 1 to 44, the third leadi ng cause of death for ages 45 to 64, and the eighth leading cause of death for those over the age of 65.386 In 2020, more than 170,200 unintentional injury deaths in the U.S. were attributed to three causes: poisoning (43.5%), motor vehicle traffic acciden ts (20.3%) and falls (21.0%).386 According to the Report Card on Children, Families, and Community, 2021, more children die or become seriously hurt from injuries than from all childhood diseases combined, and childhood inj uries can result in long -term disabilities. They can be prevented by changing the environment, behaviors, products, social norms and policies. The groups at greatest risk of childhood injury include children under one year old or older youth as well as Nat ive American and rural children.387 According to the CDC, TBI is a major cause of death and disability in the U.S., contributing to about 32% of all injury deaths. Those who survive TBI can face effects lasting a few days to disabilities that l ast the rest of their lives.

Public health approaches to injury prevention can reduce the rate of TBI and it s long -term c onsequences.388 In addition, in 2019, the economic cost of injury in the U.S. was $4.2 trillion, including $327 billion in medical care, $69 billion in work loss and $3.8 trillion in value of statistical life and quality of life losses. Economic cost was hi ghest among working - age adults, highlighting that injuries during the most productive part of people's lives result in a high societal cost.389 Traumatic injury is the leading cause of death among children, with many survivors enduring the conse quences of brain and SCI. The physical, emotional, psychological and learning problems that affect injured children, along with the associated costs, make reducing traumatic injuries a high priority for health and safety advocates throughout the nation. Ed ucational p rograms like ThinkFirst increase knowledge and awareness of the causes and risk factors of brain and SCI, injury prevention measures, and the use of safety habits at an early age.390 Objectives Provide the ThinkFirst injury prevention program to children, adolescents and young adults throughout SDC Provide presentations and opportunities to San Diego County Office of Education (SDCOE) high school students around injury and violence prevention and health care career re adiness FY 2022 Report of Ac tivities ThinkFirst San Diego (ThinkFirst) \u2014 a program led by Sharp Rehab \u2014 is a chapter of the ThinkFirst National Injury Prevention Foundation, a nonprofit organization dedicated to preventing brain, spinal cord and other traumatic injuries through educ ation, research and advocacy. ThinkFirst includes specialized health care professionals known as Voices for Injury Prevention (VIPs) who have personally experienced traumatic injuries. At Sharp, VIPs help educate local youth about injury prevention by usin g their personal stories and explaining how making safer choices could have prevented the lifelong effects of a traumatic injury. SDCOE provides a variety of educational, administrative and other support services for schools throughout SDC. This includes a college and career readiness program to help students explore the world of work and build the skills nece ssary for a successful career. In partnership with SDCOE, in FY 2022, Sharp's ThinkFirst program provided injury prevention education to nearly 200 s tudents in grades nine through 12 from Montgomery, San Ysidro and San Diego high schools. Due to the contin ued impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on schools, all activities were conducted virtually. The programs consisted of one - to two -hour classes on topics including the modes of injury (e.g., automobile collisions, violence and injuries tied to sports/recreation); disability 388 CDC, National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (2022), Get the Facts About TBI . 389 CDC Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021).

These program s were enhanced by powerful testimonies from Sharp' s VIPs. Presentations included lengthy q uestion -and-answer segments to strengthen the feeling of connectedness between the students and the VIP speakers. Students had the opportunity to ask questions by un muting themselves or typing their questions into the chat box. Despite the virtual format, students showed greater engagement and participation compared to previous in -person presentations. FY 2023 Plan ThinkFirst will do the following:391 Provide present ations to high school students on injury prevention, including career paths in physical re habilitation Provide and expand educational program offerings to schools and organizations in SDC Partner with schools to assess the provision of virtual injury prev ention education Increase community awareness of ThinkFirst through attendance and participation at community health fairs and events Expand beyond the scope of the SDCOE's College and Career Readiness Department to provide and provide educational presenta tions to schools in North County, Coronado and South Bay Grow partnerships with the SDCOE's College and Career Readiness Department through participation in conferences, round table events and collaborative projects As appropriate, explore opportunities t o incorporate concussion education into school and communit y-based presentations As requested, provide education to health care professionals and college students interested in health care careers Identified Community Need: Health Professions Education and Training, and Collaboration with Local Schools to Promote Interest and Career Pathways in Health Care Rationale references the findings of the SMH 2022 CHNA, HASD&IC 2022 CHNA or the most recent SDC community health statistics unless otherwise indicate d. Rationale The HASD&IC 2022 CHNA identified workf orce shortages as a foundational challenge that greatly exacerbates the priority health and social needs (access to health care, aging care & support, behavioral health, children & youth well -being, chronic health conditions, community safety and economic stability) affecting community members served by SMH. 391 Where applicable, ThinkFirst will perform these activities as COVID -19 public health and safety guidelines allow. Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 314 Workforce shortages were described by HASD&IC 2022 CHNA community engagement participants as the number one priority for local health care providers . The pandemic has severely strained the existing heal th care workforce, and staffing shortages have exacerbated challenges in meeting the demand for community services. All health care settings, including behavioral health, were described as understaffed, and workforce shortages can adversely impact the pati ent experience. Further, the workforce shortage is creating a wider equity gap, with fewer culturally competent and linguistically appropriate providers available to care for SDC's diverse communities. The IPH Sharp Provider and Sharp Human Resources surve ys conducted as part of the SMH 2022 CHNA process identified several educational topics of particular interest and importance to employee professional development, including: defining cultural humility and applying it to health care; the impact of implicit or unconscious bias on decision -making; maternal and infant health with a focus on the Black community; and health disparities among various groups, including the Black, Asian, Latinx and immigrant com munities. Nearly 90% of IPH Sharp Provider Survey part icipants reported that COVID -19 had at least a moderate impact in employees' desire to change careers or leave the workforce, which may create challenges in meeting the health care needs of the communit y. Of these, the majority (78%) reported that Sharp does not have programs or services available to address this issue. The HASD&IC and SM H 2022 CHNAs identified the need for a trauma -informed approach to care and the importance of education, training and treating those they serve with dignity. Implem enting these approaches by recognizing trauma, strengthening resiliency, and avoiding re -traumatization can lead to more open communication, greater patient engagement, and better attention to patient needs. The San Diego Workforce Partnership (SDWP) repor ted that, in 2021, there were 186,000 people employed in the health care sector in SDC, accounting for 13% of all jobs countywide.392 SDWP also cites research by the University of Washington Center for Women's Welfare that estimates the basic needs of a si ngle adult resident of SDC to cost $3,058.72 per month, requiring full -time employment at $17.65 an hour. Of the 20 most common occupations in SDC's health care sector, there are 11 with training requirements le ss than or equal to an associate degree that can provide new graduates with a living wage.392 Total employment in California is projected to grow 16% between 2020 and 2030, reflecting an increase of 2.8 millio n jobs statewide over the decade. The educational services (private), health care and social assistance sector is expected to be one of the fastest -growing industries in California, with 19.0% growth anticipated.393 Accor ding to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Stat istics' Employment Projections - 2021 - 2031 report, employment in health care and social assistance is projected to add about 2.6 million jobs from 2021 to 2031 \u2014 the highest growth among all industry sectors. Factors th at are expected to contribute to this growth include rising demand 392 San Diego Workforce Partnership (2021), Expanding Access to Healthcare Jobs in San Diego County: Healthcare Sector Overview . 393 California Employment Developme nt Department ( EDD) (2022), Employment Projections . Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 315 for the care of an aging baby -boom population, longer life expectancies and higher prevalence of chronic conditions.394 According to a report from the California Health Care Foundation (CHCF ) titled California Physicians: A Port rait of Practice , the supplies of physicians, physician assistants and three types of advanced practice nurses in California grew between 2016 and 2020, while the supply of clinical nurse specialists decreased. The increased supply of licensed physicians d oes not accurately reflect the availability of care, however \u2014 less than half of California's physicians provided care 40 or more hours per week.395 According to a report titled Health Workforce Strategies for Californi a, studies conducted over the past four decades demonstrate that multi -component pipeline programs for high school, college and post -baccalaureate students underrepresented in the health professions positively impact a variety of outcomes with the potentia l to improve the diversity of the healt h care workforce.396 Although California has enacted various policies to increase both the size and the diversity of the health workforce, current public and private sector efforts have not been sufficient to alleviat e existing shortages.396 The California Future Health Workforce Commission (CFHWC) has described several recent state budget and policy actions intended to address the significant health and economic impacts of the COVID -19 pandemic. This includes i nvestments in the mental health workforce, particularly for those who work with children and youth; investments in phys ician residencies, with an emphasis on psychiatry; additional HCAI oversight for state -supported health workforce programs; expanding the scope of practice for nurse practitioners; and creating several new reimbursable provider types, such as community hea lth workers.397 According to CFHWC key informant interviews with private sector health care leaders, California's workforce needs include i ncreasing workforce diversity; educating young Californians that futures in the health sector are appealing regardless of background, socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity, and gender; and partnering with schools and companies to remove barriers to continui ng education and develop pipelines for jobs.398 A CHCF survey of frontline health care workers during COVID -19 reflect s the sustained mental and emotional toll of providing patient care during the pandemic. Six in 10 providers continue to feel overworked an d burned out, while nearly half are frustrated by their job. Nearly three out of four nurses (72%) say they feel burn ed out from their work \u2014 higher than the 61% reported among nurse practitioners and physician assistants, 57% among doctors and 56% among b ehavioral health specialists.399 394 U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (2022), Employment Projections - 2021 -2031 . 395 California Foundation ( CHCF (2021), California Physicians, 2021: A Portrait of . 396 CHCF (2021), Health Workforce Strategies for California: A review of the Evidence . 397 California Future Health Workfor ce Commission (CFHWC) (2022), January 2022 Up date on Health Workforce Progress . 398 CFHWC (2020), Meeting the Demand for Health: Top Priorities, Challenges, and Proposed Actions for the Private Sector to Support the Workforce California Needs . 399 CHCF (2021), COVID -19 Tracking Poll, May 2021 Views fro m California Health Care Providers on the Front Lines . Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 316 Objectives Collaborate with schools, colleges and universities to provide opportuni ties for students to explore and train for a variety of health care professions Collaborate with local schools to promote interest and provi de career pathways in health care Provide training for local, national and international health care professionals FY 2022 Report of Activities In FY 2022, SMH collaborated with local, state and national schools, colleges and universities to provide le arning opportunities for students to explore and train for careers in health care. Although pandemic -related interruptions to student placement continued in FY 2022, SMH and the OPP still offered valuable hospital -based training to 245 nursing students, 17 advanced practice provider students and more than 230 ancillary (non-nursing) students. These students spent more than 80,700 hours on the hospital campus in FY 2022. Program partners included American Career College, Azusa Pacific University, California State University San Marcos , EMSTA College, Grand Canyon University, Grossmont College, Grossmont Health Occupations Center , National University , Palomar College, Medical Institute, Point Loma Nazarene University ( PLNU ), San Diego Mesa College, San Di ego State University (SDSU ), San Joaquin Valley College, Southwestern College (SWC), University of California (UC) San Diego, UC San Diego Extension, University of San Diego, University of Southern California , University of St. Augustine for Health Science s and Western Governors University. In addition, SMH partnered with Midwestern University in Glendale, Arizona , to provide physician -led mentorship opportunities for 12 medical students. The Sharp Diabetes Education Program provided education to several s tudents throughout FY 202 2. In September, the Sharp Diabetes Education Program provided virtual diabetes education on the different types of diabetes, diagnoses, current technology and medication, community resources for patients, patient education modalit ies and careers in diabetes to more than 20 dietetic students at SDSU. The Sharp Diabetes Education Program also mentored two dietetic interns from the San Diego Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) Dietetic Internship program. The director of the Sharp Diab etes Edu cation Program served as a board member of the San Diego WIC Dietetic Internship program in FY 202 2 and provided a presentation on diabetes care, the role of the dietitian, the different types of diabetes, nutrition and meal planning, diabetes and technolo gy and more to all six interns in the program. Additionally, the Sharp Diabetes Education Program provided mentorship to a graduate nursing student intern at SMH. In September, the program director participated in a career panel discussing careers in diete tics, including outpatient diabetes care, to approximately 50 dietetics students at the California Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Career Fair at PLNU. During the panel's question -and-answer session, attendees were able to ask questions about panelists' experiences in the field of dietetics . Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 317 Through affiliations with EMSTA College, Palomar Community College, SWC and the San Diego Fire -Rescue Department's paramedic training program, SMH provided both clinical training and observation hours for 32 communi ty paramedic interns in FY 2022. Students completed more than 140 hours of clinical training primarily in the ED, with scheduled rotations in the trauma bay, catheterization lab, operating room, labor and delivery, and pulmonary services. SMH's ED staff co ntributed approximately 4,600 hours of clinical training and supervision to these students in FY 2022. In addition, SMH collaborated with County of San Diego EMS to provide two mobile intensive care nurse training programs. The extensive, six -week classroo m-based program trains registered nurses to operate hospital base station radio equipment and provide care in the pre - hospital setting. In FY 2022, SMH also provided educational opportunities to students in grades nine through twelve from Health S ciences High and Middle College (HSHMC). Through Sharp's partnership with HSHMC, students shadow health care providers in both patient and non -patient care environments to explore real -world applications of their school coursework. For two weeks in Septemb er, appr oximately 85 students shadowed SMH staff from various hospital teams, including but not limited to radiology, nursing, patient transport, and library services. In addition to providing education and training to community students, SMH team member s suppor ted the development of community health professionals. In April SMH trauma center staff provided a presentation titled Traumatic Hemorrhage and Bloodless Management - A Little Goes a Long Way to approximately 50 members of the San Diego Chapter of the AACN . Topics included accident prevention, risk mitigation, STOP the Bleed, rapid transport to care, blood transfusion and more. Sharp Rehab provided a free, online Mindful Self -Compassion course to 16 community and Sharp professionals in FY 2022. De signed b y professionals at the University of Texas and Harvard Medical School - Cambridge Health Alliance, Mindful Self - Compassion teaches mindfulness, self -kindness and self -compassion skills to help health professionals recognize difficult situations and respond with greater resilience. In 2018, the SMH assistant librarian created the Health Subcommittee for the San Diego Regional Human Trafficking and CSEC Advisory Council. This multidisciplinary group includ es physicians, nurses, mental health profess ionals, social workers, executives and community stakeholders . It was established to support health care systems in addressing human trafficking and supporting survivors through sharing best practices, protocol development and education. As part of this wo rk, in F Y 2022 the SMH assistant librarian provided education and training to community health care professionals on how to prope rly identif y and care for survivors of human trafficking. These efforts help address the findings of Sharp's triennial CHNAs an d suppor t the collaborative, countywide HASD&IC CHNA process. For the third year, in October the SMH assistant librarian served as a facilitator at the two-day Train -the-Trainer Academy presented by HEAL ( Health, Education, Advocacy, Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 318 Linkage ) Trafficking \u2014 an org anization that leads innovative health solutions to address human trafficking in communities worldwide. The program equipped more than 40 public health and health care educators with the knowledge and skills needed to train other health professiona ls in th eir communities to respond to human trafficking. In September, the SMH assistant librarian participated on a panel at the Trauma Informed Care Town Hall presented by the California Association for Nurse Practitioners Health Justice Committee. During the event, approximately 100 attendees learned about what trauma -informed care (TIC) is, why it matters, and how to apply it to support patients and providers. Also in September, the SMH assistant librarian shared a poster presentation with 100 comm unity health and research professionals during the 8 th Annual Sharp Interprofessional Research & Innovations Conference. The presentation taught participants how to use the PEARR (provide privacy, educate, ask, respect and respond) tool \u2014 an evidence -based framework for the assessment of trafficking and other forms of interpersonal violence \u2014 to reduce stigma and support patients who have been trafficked or experienced unsafe relationships. In FY 2022, the SMH assistant librarian supported community healt h providers through a TIC continuing education series, which was develop ed in collaboration with the Institute on Violence, Abuse and Trauma; Palomar Heath; and the Health Subcommittee for the San Diego Regional Human Trafficking and CSEC Advisory Council. Beginning in 2021, t he SMH assistant librarian provided planning support for the series, as well as education on topics including: the neurobiology of trauma (post- traumatic stress disorder ); principles of TIC; the PEARR tool; adverse childhood experience (ACE) scores ( a metric for the amount of toxic stress endured during childhood) ; and vicarious trauma (the effect a traumatized client has on frontline staff). By providing clinicians with the knowledge and skills to address the violence and exploitation impacting patients, the TIC continuing education series can improve both clinician and patient experiences. In addition, the series helps address the social determinants of health ( SDOH ) that contribute to human trafficking and similar exploitation (e.g., addiction and its potential contributions to poor health outcomes) and helps promote the dignity and autonomy of patients. Further, updating procedures and language to be trauma -informed as a universal precaution improves Sharp's efforts to implement perso n-centered care for all patients. In FY 2022, the TIC continuing education series served approximately 70 community health care professionals. As co -chair of the Health Subcommittee for the San Diego Regional Human Trafficking and CSEC Advisory Council, the SMH assistant librarian provided planning and support for the committee's monthly meetings, which covered a range of topics in FY 2022 including: non-fatal stra ngulation assessment, labor trafficking, teen dating violence, introduction to TIC, experiences of trafficking within LGBTQ+ communities, and the dangers of conspiracy thinking in anti -human trafficking work, as well as open forum discussions on topics of interest or concern. More than 150 community members attended the live meetings, some of which were recorded and shared on YouTube . More than 500 community members received meeting details, best practices and topic resources throughout the year. Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 319 The SMH assistant librarian engaged in a variety of other efforts throughout the year to promote best p ractice sharing in addressing human trafficking and supporting survivors. This included providing feedback to the San Diego County Board of Supervisors a nd HASD&IC on needs and gaps in addressing human trafficking in the San Diego community. In addition, the SMH assistant librarian collaborated with Your Safe Place: A Family Justice Center, Planned Parenthood, HASD&IC, and the Health Subcommittee for the S an Diego Human Trafficking & CSEC Advisory Council to support patients experiencing domestic violence a nd/or human trafficking. Efforts included creating a local hotline to the Safe Shelter Collaborative as well as developing personal items (e.g., lip balm ) that contain discreet safety information and resources for those in need. Further, in February, the S MH team member presented on a trauma -informed approach to human trafficking to 65 physician assistant and nursing students from PLNU. Further, SMH cont ributes to the expansion of scientific knowledge and medical advancements throughout the larger health and research communities through participation in clinical trials. In FY 2022, SMH provided orthopedic clinical trials to improve care and outcomes of pa tients with musculoskeletal disorders, including osteoarthritis, cartilage repair, hip dysplasia and bo ne injury, as well as bone regeneration treatment. FY 2023 Plan SMH will do the following:377 Provide professional development opportunities for health professions students and interns throughout SDC Collabor ate with HSHMC to provide opp ortunities for high school students to explore careers in health care Offer education and training programs for community health professionals Participate in oncology -related continuing education opportunities for community physicians and other health care professionals Provide continuing education lectures to community physicians, residents, interns and Navy personnel at the SMH Hip Preservation Center Participate on the Health Subcommittee for the San Diego Regional Human Trafficking and CSEC Advisory C ouncil to assist health care systems with addressing human trafficking and supporting survivors Collaborate with community partners to offer vaccines (e.g., Hepatitis A, Human Papillomavirus) to survivors of human trafficking Promote Sharp's continuing edu cation series on TIC to internal and external stakeholders In collaboration with HASD&IC, explore and implement protocols in regional health care systems to identify and support patients who have been trafficked Collaborate w ith HASD&IC to provide a cont inuing education event addressing human trafficking in health care settings Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 320 Explore opportunities to train survivors of human trafficking to teach best practices to health care systems Support plans of local stakeholders and o rganizations to create safe s paces for LGBTQ+ and other youth to learn about healthy relationships and boundaries Identified Community Need: Access to Health Care and Community and Social Support Rationale references the findings of the SMH 2022 CHNA, H ASD&IC 2022 CHNA or the most recent SDC community health statistics unless otherwise indicated. Rationale The HASD&IC and SMH 2022 CHNAs identified access to health care and economic stability among the priority health and social needs affecting the comm unity members served by SMH, particularly underserved and underfunded patients who face inequities. The HASD&IC and SMH 2022 CHNAs identified the following themes related to accessing health care in SDC: overall barriers to care; the impact of telehealth; health literacy; transpo rtation; health insurance and financial concerns; stigma; the needs of specific populations (LGBTQ+, people experiencing homelessness, individuals at the end of life, undocumented individuals, and parents or caregivers); the need fo r TIC; and workforce cha llenges. HASD&IC 2022 CHNA participants also described the following logistical challenges related to accessing health care: making primary care appointments or accessing their usual source of care; insurance restrictions and confu sion; a need for referra ls to access certain services or treatments; finding the right fit with a provider; and timeliness related to level of care, such as locating after -hours urgent care. Across HASD&IC's interviews and focus groups, there was a unive rsal acknowledgment that the COVID -19 pandemic caused widespread disruption to SDC's local health care system. Factors impacting the ability to access health care included postponed or canceled procedures, long wait times for appointments and the fear of C OVID -19 exposure. Near ly all (99%) IPH Sharp Provider Survey participants reported COVID -19 had an impact on patients' access to transportation, which may result in decreased access to health care. Strategies to address this included increasing community awareness about shuttle access or Sharp Van Services and providing telehealth. According to the HASD&IC 2022 CHNA, financial concerns may deter patients from accessing health care. Financial assistance to help pay for medical bills was described as a fre quent and significant ne ed.Community members are not always aware of low or no -cost programs that may be available to help pay for services. According to 2 -1-1's CIE 2021 Client Profile Report, the top five needs for 2 -1-1 clients ages 60 and older were (in rank order): housing , utilities, income support and employment, consumer services, and health care.400 400 2-1-1 Community Information Exchange (2021), Client Profile Report . Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 321 An analysis of ICD -10 (International Classification of Diseases - 10th Revision) codes indicates that, in FY 2022, a total of 757 inpatients at SMH experienced homelessness \u2014 a 42.4% decrease compared to FY 2021. In addition, a total of 352 SMH inpatients had an ICD -10 diagnosis for problems related to living alone in FY 202 2 - the highest among all Sharp hospitals. In 2021, 12.4% of SDC adults, teens and children reported hav ing no usual source of health care. In addition, 19.7% of SDC residents reported that they had not visited a doctor at all in the previous year. Accord ing to San Diego Association of Governments ' 2021 COVID -19 Impacts report, the top three ways Californian s reported spending their stimulus checks included food (22%), utilities (16%) and rent (14%).401 According to the San Diego Hunger Coalition, while nut rition insecurity has declined since 2021, high rates remain due to long -standing economic disparities tha t were exacerbated by the COVID -19 pandemic . As of March 2022, more than 1 in 4 San Diegans experienced nutrition insecurity, with disproportionate im pacts noted among communities of color.339 As of September 2 022, the overall unemployment rate in SDC was 3.1%, which was lower than both the unemployment rate for the state of California (3.8%) and the national rate (3.5%) during the same period.402 According to the San Diego Regional Task Force on Homelessness' 202 2 Point -in- Time Count, there was a 3% increase in SDC's unsheltered homeless population from 2020 to 2022. There were no fewer than 4,106 homeless individuals without shelter on a given night in 2022 compared to 3,971 in 2020. Of the 8,427 individuals expe riencing homelessness in SDC in 2022, about half (51.2%) received so me form of housing or services.403 In 2020, 1 in 4 unsheltered SDC residents were adults ages 55 and over. Among the region's unsheltered seniors, 88% became homeless in SDC and 43% reported experiencing homelessness for the first time in their lives.404 Nationwide, the population of individuals ages 65 and older experiencing homelessness is expected to nearly triple over the next decade \u2014 from 40,000 in 2020 to approximately 106,000 by 2030.405 According to findings from the CHCF 2022 California Health Polic y Survey, half of Californians (49%) reported taking at least one action to delay, skip, or cut back on care in the past 12 months because of concerns related to cost. Of those who delayed ca re due to cost, 47% reported that their health condition worsened .406 According to the same survey, more than 1 in 4 lower -income Californians (30%) reported that it was \"somewhat\" or \"very\" difficult to find a provider who took their insurance, compared to 12% of Californians with higher incomes.406 In addition, among Californians with lower incomes, 4 in 10 reported being very worried about affording unexpected medical bills (42%), out -of-pocket costs (39%), rent or mortgage (41%), and transportation costs (40%).406 401 San Diego Association of Governments (2021), The San D iego Economy: A Year in Review of COVID -19 Impacts . 402 California EDD (2022), Labor Market Information . 403 San Diego Regional Taskforce on Homelessness (2022), San Diego County WeAllCount Point -in-Time Count . 404 Serving Seniors (2021), Senior Homelessness: A N eeds Assessment . 405 University of Pennsylvania (2019), The Emerging Crisis of Aged Homelessness: Could Housing Solutions Be Funded by Avoidance of Ex cess Shelter, Hospital, and Nursing Home Costs? 406 CHCF (2022), The 2022 CHCF California Health Policy Survey . Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 322 Objectives Collaborate with community organizations to provide fo llow-up medical care, financial assistance, psychiatric and social services to indivi duals experiencing homelessness or who lack a safe home environment Collaborate with community partners to connect individuals experiencing homelessness, food insecurity o r other health equity barriers to community -based services Provide transportation and pharmaceutical assistance to individuals with financial barriers FY 2022 Report of Activities SMH provides post -acute care facilitation for vulnerable patients, includ ing individuals who experience homelessness or lack a safe home environment. Advocacy for safe discharge from the hospital is a top priority, regardless of funding. In FY 2022, SMH provided assessments for those at risk for psychiatric and developmental disorders and substance use issues, as well as referrals for housing, medication mana gement and supportive community services. SMH also assist ed high-risk, underserved patients with transportation home from the hospital as well as with connections to community resources for food, clothing and housing. In addition, SMH provide d new clothi ng items to patients without usable clothing at discharge, in cluding individuals experiencing homelessness, trauma patients from the ED and any other patient who lack ed clothing when leaving the hospital. SMH also has programs to provide uninsured patien ts with financial assistance for medication and medical equip ment. In FY 2022, SMMC provided more than $51,400 in free medications and transportation to individuals with financial barriers through its Project HELP program. SMH funded temporary housing and skilled nursing care for several patients in FY 2022 , includ ing individuals experiencing homelessness. Further , SMH assisted individuals who experience homelessness and test COVID positive by connecting them to the County of San Diego's Temporary Lodging Program for individuals affected by COVID -19 without a safe p lace to quarantine or isolate. In FY 2022, SMH supported community members experiencing food insecurity during the 2021 holiday season by collecting nearly 1,200 pounds of food for donation to the Food Bank. Throughout the year, SMH also served as a blood donation site for Sharp's systemwide blood drive to collect life -saving blood for those with medical needs. Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 323 Further, Sharp's Patient Access Services team provides robust services to assist w ith access to care and health insurance coverage for patients at all Sharp hospitals, including patients of SMH. Please refer to Section 1 (Overview): Patient Access to Care Programs for more information on these programs and services. Beginning in FY 2019, SMH joined Sharp's systemwide pilot partners hip with 2 -1-1's CIE to better understand and address the health equity barriers that influence the health and well -being of their patients. Research continues to underscore that SDOH have a significant impact on a person's ability to access care and maint ain health. SMH joined the CIE pilot partnership to provide more informed, holistic care to patients with challenges to health equity, and to connect them directly to community re sources to meet those needs. Approximately 130 CIE community partners \u2014 including health care organizations, the County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency , housing networks, food banks and other social service agencies \u2014 use an integrated techn ology platform to support proactive, holistic, person -centered care. Shared r ecords enable CIE partners to evaluate an individual's SDOH needs and utilization history of community services and to make direct referrals to critical, community -based resources . SMH case managers and social workers were trained on CIE to better serve pa tients in the acute care setting, including patients who experience homelessness, food insecurity and other hardships. Although delays and obstacles to CIE implementation and ado ption persisted due to the COVID -19 pandemic during Year 3 of the CIE pilot, utilization metrics were sustained after demonstrating growth between Years 1 and 2. Community members across SDC were assisted through the CIE including residents of Downtown San Diego, Mission Valley, Southeast San Diego, Encanto, El Cajon, Lakeside, La Mesa, Otay Mesa, National City, Chula Vista, Carlsbad, Escondido and Oceanside. The top community referrals provided to patients through the CIE included utilities, food, housing and economic support.

Costs f or patients paid through the Medicare program on a prospective basis also include payments to third parties related to the specific population. 410 Charity care and bad debt reflect the unreimbursed costs of providing services to patients without the ability to pay for services at the time the services were rendered. 411 \"Vulnerable populations\" means any population that is exposed to medical or financial risk by virtue of being uninsured, underinsured, or elig ible for Medi -Cal, Medicare, California Children's Services Program, or county indigent programs. 412 Unreimbursed costs may include an hourly rate for labor and benefits, plus costs for supp lies, materials and other purch ased services. Any offsetting revenue (such as fees, grants or external donations) is deducted from the costs of providing service s. Unreimbursed costs were estimated by each department responsible for providing the program o r service.

See Appendix B for a map of community and region boundaries in SDC. For SMV's and SMC's 2022 CHN A process, the Dignity Health/ IBM Watson Health Community Need Index (CNI) was used to identify communities within its service area that experience greater health inequities .414,415 The CNI uses demographic and economic statistics to provide a \"CNI score\" for every populated ZIP code in the U.S. CNI scores measure inequity on a scale ranging from very low health inequity to very high health inequity. This measurement is an average determined through an analysis of specific socioeconomic barriers to health care access, including education, income, culture/language, insurance , and housing. As such, the CNI demonstrates the link between community need, access to care and preventable hospitalizat ions. According to the CNI, communities served by SMV and SMC with es pecially high need include a number of communities in SDC's south, central and east regions .414 Figure 26 presents a map of the CNI findings across SDC. 414 Dignity He alth and IBM Watson Health Community Need Index ( CNI) (2022). The Dignity Health and IBM Watson CNI was discontinued on January 31, 2023. 415 According to the World Health Organization ( WHO ), health inequities are differences i n health status or in the distr ibution of health resources between different population groups arising from the social conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work and age. These inequities have significant social and economic costs both to indivi duals and societies (WHO, 2018) .

The most re cent CHNAs and implementation strategies for both SMV and SMC are available at http://www.sharp.com/about/community/health - needs-assessments.cfm . Through the SMV and SMC 20 22 CHNAs, the following priority health needs were identified for the communities served by SMV and SMC (listed in alphabetical order): Access to Health Care Aging Care & Support Behavioral Health Children & Youth Well -being Chronic Health Conditions Commu nity Safety Economic Stability SMV and SMC are specialty hospital facilities providing behavioral health and substance use programs and services. Therefore, in alignment with these identified needs, the following pages detail programs that specifically ad dress behavioral health and substance use needs, along with associated priority health and social needs. Please refer to Section 1 (Overvie w): Patient Access to Care Programs for additional entity and systemwide programs des igned to address access to health care. As specialty hospital facilities, SMV and SMC lack the resources to comprehensively address the elements of community education and support for all identified needs. The other identified health needs are addressed through programs and services provided by Sharp Mary Birch Hospital for Women & Newborns (SMBHWN) and Sharp Memorial Hospital (SMH). Please refer to Sections 9 and 10 (respectively) of this report for details on those programs. SMV, SMH and SMBHWN are all conveniently located on the Sharp Metropolitan Medical Campus .

For each priority community need identified above, subsequent pages include a summary of the rationale and importance of the need, obj ective(s), FY 202 2 Report of Activities conducted in support of the objective(s), and FY 202 3 Plan. Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 335 Identified Community Need: Behavioral Health and Substance Use Educa tion for the Community Rationale references the findings of the SMV and SMC 20 22 CHNAs, HASD&IC 20 22 CHNA or the most recent SDC community health statistics unless otherwise indicated. Rationale The HASD&IC, SMV and SMC 2022 CHNAs identified behavioral health as one of the priority health needs affecting community members in SDC. W ithin this need, the following themes were identified: increasing behavioral health needs and substance use; overall access to care; the impact of stigma; post -acute care conce rns; the needs of specific populations (dual diagnosis patients, LGBTQ+, people experiencing homelessness, veterans and military, Native American/tribal groups, refugees, and undocumented individuals); and workforce challenges. Data analysis in the SMV an d SMC 2022 CHNAs revealed a higher volume of behavioral health hospital discharg es in communities facing greater socioeconomic challenges throughout SDC.426 Participants in HASD&IC's interviews and focus groups universally acknowledged that the COVID -19 pan demic caused widespread disruption to community members' ability to access need ed behavioral health care. Pandemic -related factors that have contributed to increasing behavioral health needs include economic hardship, uncertainty, social isolation and lone liness, and loss of a loved one. HASD&IC community engagement participants ide ntified timely and appropriate behavioral health services, counseling or therapy, and psychiatry among the most difficult services to access. Identified barriers to accessing be havioral health care include workforce shortages; lack of availability of neede d resources; long wait times for appointments ; unaffordability of services; insurance issues; and lack of access to technology and transportation. More than two -thirds (70%) of HASD&IC 2022 CHNA online community survey respondents identified behavioral he alth as a top health need in the community. The 10 most important mental or behavioral health needs in the community (in ranked order) were noted to be: depression; access to he lp; anxiety; stress; drug use; disorders (SUD use; burnout or fatigue; opioid use (including Fentanyl); and suicide or suicidal thoughts. Community members with behavioral health disorders identified stigma as a pervasive issue imp acting their overall health, well -being and quality of life. This is a particular concern for people of color, LGBTQ+, people experiencing homelessness, undocumented immigrants, refugees and Native American or tribal communities. The HASD&IC, SMV and SMC 2 022 CHNAs identified the need for a trauma - informed approach to care and the importance of education, training and treating those they serve with dignity. Implementing trauma -informed approaches to care by recognizing trauma, strengthening resiliency, and avoiding re -traumatization can lead to more open communication, greater pati ent engagement and better attention to patient needs. 426 Dignity Hea lth and IBM Watson Health CNI (2022). Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 336 According to 2021 CHIS data, 17.7% of adults in SDC have ever seriously thought about committing suicide, a n increase of 3.1 p ercentage points compared to 2020 (14.6%).423 In 2019, there were 224 hospitalizations attributed to substance -related disorders in SDC. The age -adjusted rate of hospitalizations due to sub stance -related disord ers was 7.1 per 100,000 population.427 In 2019, the age -adjusted rate of ED visits for substance related disorders in SDC was 113.2 per 100,000 population. Age -adjusted rates of substance related disorder ED visits were higher among mal es, Black individuals and those ages 25 to 44 years in comparison among groups. In 2019, California's state mental health authority provided treatment to 108,669 adolescents ages 13 to 17, representing 16.3% of all individuals treated by the state and an 8 .2% decrease from 2018 .428 In 2020, 17.0% of U.S. adolescents experienced a major depressive episode and an estimated 41.6% received treatment for depression .428 Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration ( SAMHSA ) estim ates that, in 2020, approximately 17 million adults in the U.S. had co -occurring mental health and SUDs.428 According to HP2030, very few people with a n SUD access available, effective treatment. Lack of access to care and screening, as well as stigma, contribute t o this treatment gap. Promising strategies include developing best practices for screening in primary care settings and increasing provider capacity to prescribe medications for treating SUDs.429 During 2019, 13% of individuals age s 12 years and older repo rted that they had used illicit drugs while 1.9% misused prescription drugs in the past month.430 In 2020, the rate of suicide among California veterans was significantly higher compared to those who did not serve , but significantly lower than the rate among all veterans nationwide . Male s accounted for 96.6% of suicide deaths among California veterans.431 The suicide rate for veterans in the U.S. in 2020 was 57.3% greater than the rate among non -veterans.432 Approxim ately 8% of the population will develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD ) during their lifetime; however, these figures are higher among veterans and active -duty service members. Each year, approximately 11% to 20% of veterans of Operations Ira qi Freed om and Enduring Freedom and 12% of Gulf War veterans have PTSD, while it is estimated that 30% of Vietnam veterans have had PTSD in their lifetime.433 Organizational and provider -related barriers to veterans accessing high -quality mental health care includ e shortages in the behavioral health workforce, inadequate availability of appointments and variability in the use of evidence -based treatments 427 County of San Diego HHSA, PHS, CHSU (2021); U.S. Census Bureau, 201 5-2019 American Community Survey 5 -year estimates. 428 Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) (2021).

Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 337 tailored to veterans. Individual -level barriers include concern that admitting a mental health problem is a sign of weakness, skepticism about the effectiveness of treatment, concerns about the negative side effects of medication and fear of job or career repercussions from seeking behavioral health care.434 Research has shown suicide risk among veterans to be impact ed by multiple factors, including acute psychosocial stressors; low cholesterol; using opioid medications for pain control; insomnia; behavioral health conditions like anxiety disorder, bipolar disorder, depression, PTSD, and traumatic brain injury; and su bstance use , especially heavy binge drinking.435 Objectives Provide behavioral health and substance use education for patients, their loved ones and the community Support the behavioral health community through sponsorship of , and participation in, community events FY 202 2 Report of Activities In FY 2022 , SMV and SMC hosted virtual community education sessions and workshops to increase awareness of behavioral health and substance use issues. Education addressed a variety of t opics, including psychot herapy, substance use, life transitions, domestic violence and child and geriatric psychiatry. This included SMV's monthly virtual lecture series designed to educate participants about cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) \u2014 a research -based treatment approac h to mood disturbances and behavior problems that is used to treat depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, panic disorder, phobias, anger, relationship problems, grief and loss and other difficulties that bring people to therapy. Throughout the year, SMV' s Trauma and PTSD Recovery Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP) provided specialized services to active -duty service members, veterans, military families and the community. This program provided a safe environment for individuals to learn effective methods f or coping with and managing symptoms of PTSD, acute stress disorder and mood -related disruptions. SMV's Trauma and PTSD Recovery IOP continued to offer evidence -based therapies designed to address maladaptive coping strategies, assi st with recovery from co mplex post -traumatic stress and decrease mood instability. Team members also provided education and resources to reduce the stigma surrounding behavioral health issues in the military and civilian communities, as well as offered an expedited referral proce ss for IOP services to active -duty service members receiving treatment at Naval Medical Center San Diego. During FY 2022, SMV's Trauma and PTSD Recovery IOP supported approximately 200 veterans and community members who have been im pacted by trauma. 434 RAND Corporation (2019), Improving the Quality of Mental Health Care for Veterans: Lessons from RAND Research . 435 VA Office of Research & Development (2021), VA research on Su icide Prevention . Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 338 In FY 2022 , SMV and SMC provided behavioral health education, resources and presentations to the community through a variety of virtual and in -person educational events, health and wellness fairs, conferences and fundraisers. Throughou t the year, SMV clinicia ns participated in the YMCA of San Diego's Be Well webinar series, in which industry experts provided education on mindfulness and mental wellness. Webinar topics included mental well -being in the workplace, living with mental illne ss, the youth mental hea lth crisis and mental fitness. In May, SMV and SMC staff participated in the Sharp Women's Health Conference. SMV clinicians provided two breakout sessions, titled Mindful Stress Management and Improving Brain Health: Strategies f or Women of All Ages. SM V and SMC also hosted a mindful meditation room at the event, where over 200 attendees had the opportunity to relax on chairs and yoga mats while listening to a guided mindfulness session. In addition, clinicians from SMV and SMC pr ovided attendees with mo od screenings and behavioral health resources for leading a well -rounded, healthy life. SMV also sponsored and participated in events benefitting behavioral health organizations across SDC in FY 202 2. Virtual e vents included NAMI's 1 8th annual Color Ball and Inspiration Awards in October and the seventh annual Critical Issues in Child and Adolescent Mental Health Conference in March. In September, SMV sponsored the International Bipolar Foundation's 15 th annual Starry Night fundraiser. SMV also sponsored the Strut for Sobriety event in September benefitting A New PATH, a nonprofit organization focused on reducing stigma associated with addictive illness through education and compassionate support. In FY 2022 , SMV pro fessionals provided behavioral health education to the community through interviews with local news outlets, including 10News - San Diego KGTV , CBS News 8 San Diego , FOX 5 San Diego, NBC 7 San Diego, KUSI News, San Diego Magazine and KPBS. Information was also shared through Sharp Health News. Professionals offered expertise in various disciplines, including marriage and family therapy (MFT), licensed clinical social work, clinical programming, clinical psychology and clinical child psycholo gy. Interview topics included managing grief from losi ng a loved one to COVID -19; pandemic -related burnout in health care workers; the impact of the pandemic and social media on youth mental health; the implementation of Stress First Aid for health care wo rkers; the recent increase in suicides among female st udent athletes; handling uncomfortable holiday conversations; why holiday movies can improve your mood; the rise in depression and suicide among men; increasing alcohol - and opioid -related deaths during the pandemic; increased risk of hospitalization and death from COVID -19 among individuals with a psychiatric disorder; the dangers of fentanyl; psychological and emotional symptoms of burnout; taking care of mental health during the holiday season; the ne w National Suicide Prevention Hotline 988; an d managin g mental fatigue at the pandemic's two -year mark. In FY 202 2, SMV and SMC sponsored and participated in five walks to increase awareness and raise funds for behavioral health services, including NAMI Walks Your Way San Diego & Imperial Counties , Alzheimer' s San Diego's Walk4ALZ, American Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 339 Foundation for Suicide Prevention's Out of the Darkness Community Walk, Survivors of Suicide Loss' Walk in Remembrance with Hope and the American Heart Association's 2022 San Diego Heart & Stroke Walk . SMV continues to ma intain a Client Advisory Board, which obtains feedback from the hospital's outpatients, former patients and employees on how to improve programs, empower patients, promote advocacy and better serve the community. During FY 2022, members of the Client Advis ory Board continued to encourage community members, staff, current and former patients, friends and family to join their walking team \u2014 the Mighty Mesa Vista Movers \u2014 in the annual NAMIWalks Your Way San Diego & Imperial Counties event to raise awareness a nd reduce stigma around behavioral health. In FY 202 2, SMV continued to collaborate with CHIP and the Independent Living Association (ILA) to improve housing conditions for community members living wit h serious, persistent mental illness. Through this ini tiative, the ILA Work Team seeks to maintain quality standards and improve conditions for both independent living facilities (ILFs) and their residents. This includes linking residents with essential se rvices and health providers as well as reducing crime and unnecessary arrest rates. The ILA is an initiative of the CHIP Behavioral Health Work Team, in which SMV is an active participant, and the registry continues to expand to include new participating I LFs. In addition, SMV partnered with Community Researc h Foundation, PERT, ILA and the CHIP Behavioral Health Work Team to improve collaboration with patients in the community , promote recovery and decrease the stigma of mental illness and co - occurring subs tance use problems. FY 202 3 Plan SMV or SMC will do the following :436 Explore opportunities to support multicultural and vulnerable groups through community involvement and education Host and provide a variety of educational events and programs for community members Provide education on medication -assisted t reatment (MAT) to community members and behavioral health providers throughout SDC to address the opioid epidemic Serve as the med ia's go -to experts for information on behavioral health conditions and treatment Participate in community events to raise awar eness and funds for behavioral health services Participate in key behavioral health events and activities alongside patients Explore and expand collaborations with housing planning committees to provide better outcomes for community members living with me ntal illness and substance use issues 436 Where applicable, SMV and SMC will perform these activities as COVID -19 public health and safety guidelines allow. Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 340 Collaborate with CHIP and the ILA to maintain quality standards and improve housing conditio ns for ILFs and residents living with serious, persistent mental illness Identified Community Need: Behavioral Health and Su bstance Use Screenings and Community and Social Support Rationale references the findings of the SMV and SMC 20 22 CHNAs, HASD&IC 2 022 CHNA or the most recent SDC community health statistics unless otherwise indicated. Rationale The HASD&IC, SMV and SMC 2022 CHNAs identified behavioral health as one of the priority health needs affecting community members in SDC. Within this need, the following themes were identified: increasing behavioral health needs and substance use; overall access to care; the impact of stigma; post -acute care concerns; the needs of specific populations (dual diagnosis patients, LGBTQ+, people experiencing home lessness, veterans and military, Native American/Tribal groups, refugees, and undocumented individuals); and workforce challen ges. Participants in HASD&IC's interviews and focus groups universally acknowledged that the COVID -19 pandemic caused widespread disruption to community members' ability to access needed behavioral health care. Pandemic -related factors that have contribu ted to increasing behavioral health needs include economic hardship, uncertainty, social isolation and loneliness, and loss of a l oved one. HASD&IC community engagement participants identified timely and appropriate behavioral health services, counseling or therapy, and psychiatry among the most difficult services to access. Identified barriers to accessing behavioral health care include workforce shortages; lack of availability of needed resources; long wait times for appointments; unaffordability of ser vices; insurance issues; and lack of access to technology and transportation. More than two -thirds (70%) of HASD&IC 2022 CHNA on line community survey respondents identified behavioral health as a top health need in the community. The 10 most important me ntal or behavioral health needs in the community (in ranked order) were noted to be: depression; access to help; opioid use (including Fentanyl); and suicide or suicidal thoughts. In additi on, Institute for Public Health ( IPH) Sharp Provider Survey participants suggested the following strategies for addressing increas ed anxiety: increase follow - up calls and home visits; expand the availability of and access to behavioral health care services ; providing help for staff: patient education; and offering services in the patients' primary language. In general, data analysi s in the SMV and SMC 2022 CHNAs revealed a higher volume of behavioral health hospital discharges in communities facing greate r socioeconomic challenges throughout SDC.426 In 2019, there were 4,937 ED visits related to mood disorders in SDC. The age - adjusted rate of ED visits for mood disorders was 143.7 per 100,000 population. Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 341 There were 417 deaths due to self-inflicted injury (suicide) in SDC in 2019. The age - adjusted suicide rate was 12.1 per 100,000 population.427 According to 2021 CHIS data, 17.7 % of adults in SDC have ever seriously t hought about committing suicide, an increase of 3.1 percentage points compared to 2020 (14.6%).423 Among a dults served by California's public mental health system in 2021, 82.2% of those ages 18 to 20, 75.3% of those ages 21 to 64 and 93.5% of those age s 65 or older were not in the labor force.437 According to SAMHSA, 41.1 million Americans ages 12 or older (14 .9% of the population) needed substance use treatment in 2020, but only 1.4% of the population received t reatment at a specialty facility. California faces shortages in psychiatric beds at all three major levels of adult inpatient and residential care, inc luding acute care, subacute care and community residential services. From 2021 to 2026, the RAND corporat ion estimates a 1.2% growth in the need for psychiatric beds in SDC, which is lower than the estimated state average (1.7%). In 2021, the regional prev alence of Serious Psychological Distress in SDC was 1.8% below the state average.438 Further, hundreds of Californians in need of psychiatric beds are held in hospital EDs or county jails awaiting openings in inpatient care settings.438 According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , the COVID -19 pande mic has resulted in elevated levels of adverse mental health con ditions, substance use and suicidal ideation among U.S. adults. Data analysis indicates that, from August 2020 to February 2021, the percentage of adults with recent symptoms of an anxiety or a depressive disorder increased from 36.4% to 41.5%, and the percentage of those reporting an unmet behavioral health care need increased from 9.2% to 11.7%. Increases were largest among adults ages 18 to 29 years and those with less than a high school edu cation.439 The most recent California Health Care Foundation survey of California health care workers found that 9 out of 10 providers have seen an increase in patients experiencing anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation, stress -related disorders, or other mental health impacts during the COVID -19 pandemic, with 59% see ing a \"significant\" increase. In addition, two -thirds of providers say they have seen increased substance use among their patients, including nearly 1 in 3 (31%) who are seeing a \"significant\" increase.440 Objectives Provide behavioral health and substance use screenings to the community Provide community and social support for individuals impacted by behavioral health and substance use issues 437 SAMHSA (2022), 2021 Un iform Reporting System Output Tables . 438 The Rand Corporation , Adult Psychiatric Bed Capacity, Need, and Shortage Estimates in California \u20142021 . 439 (2021).

Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 342 FY 202 2 Report of Activities In FY 202 2, SMV and S MC provided several beha vioral health and substance use screening opportunities for the community on -site, virtually and in partnership with local organizations. Throughout the year, SMV 's psychiatric evaluation and intake teams provided approximately 15,200 free psychiatric eval uations and referrals for the community . Due to the ongoing COVID -19 pandemic, SMV continued to conduct the majority of these assessments via telemedicine. In addition, SMC offer ed free, hour- long substance use assessments, educatio nal materials and commun ity referral resources to more than 640 community members. The assessments were facilitated by a licensed mental health professional who provided individuals with recommendations for appropriate programs and levels of care. SMV rec ognized Mental Health Aw areness Month in May by providing a variety of behavioral health resources and events for Sharp team members and the community. SMV was the presenting sponsor at the San Diego Padres baseball team's Mental Health Awareness Night at Petco Park. The SMV Slug gers softball team was given the opportunity to throw the first pitch during the game, and several SMV team members hosted a resource table to provide attendees with education on mental well -being. An SMV clinician also provided a b ehavioral health resourc e table at Kearny High Educational Complex' s mental health fair. Throughout FY 2022, SMV collaborated with Sharp Coronado Hospital and Healthcare Center's (SCHHC) to provide an educational series at the John D. Spreckels Center and Bowling Green (Spreckels Center) in Coronado . In May, this included a relaxation session with a music therapist from SCHHC , which combin ed music with other stress reduction techniques , such as breathing and progressive muscle relaxation. In addition, in August, an SMC team member participated in an event at the County Administration Center to recognize International Overdose Awareness Day. Attendees had the opportunity to learn about and receive free boxes of overdose -reversing drugs, and to hear about th e impact of the opioid crisis from a variety of speakers. The Sharp representative spoke on behalf of those who have lost their lives to overdose and did not have family or friends present to represent them on this day. SMV also recognized Suicide Awaren ess Month in September with a variety of offerings, including virtual lectures, behavioral health screenings and community events. A clinician from SMV's Senior IOP (SIOP) provided a lecture and question -and-answer session titled The Intersection of Suicid e Risk and Substance Use, while an SMV clinical psychologist presented on Building Hope in the Face of Adversity. The audience for both lectures included Sharp team members, friends, family and community members interested in learning more about these topi cs. Further, throughout FY 2022, an SMV clinician continued to serve as the co -chair of CHIP's SPC \u2014 an inter -agency council committed to preventing suicide and its devastating consequences in SDC. Throughout FY 202 2, SMV offered virtual support groups f or community members with behavioral health challenges. A weekly Mood Disorders support group was available for Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 343 individuals, family and friends impacted by depression, bipolar disorder, PTSD or anxiety. The biweekly Dialec tical Behavioral Therapy (DBT) sup port group helped attendees develop coping skills to manage severe emotional reactions, intense anxiety, impulsivity, self -harm, suicidal thoughts and high -conflict relationships. The SMC Aftercare group also continued to meet virtually to help former pati ents problem -solve issues and make the necessary transitions to maintain a sober lifestyle following inpatient substance use treatment. In addition, SMV works with Sharp's Patient Access Services (PAS) team to connect patients to critical insurance and f inancial resources that help reduce economic barriers to behavioral health care. Sharp's PAS team provides robust services to assist with access to care and health insurance coverage for patients at all Sharp hospitals, including patients of SMV. Please re fer to Section 1 (Overview): Patient Access to Care Programs for more information on these programs and services. Beginning in FY 2019, SMV joined Sharp 's systemwide pilot partnership with 2-1-1 San Diego's ( 2-1-1) Commu nity Information Exchange (CIE) to better understand and address the health equity barriers that influence the health and well -being of their patients. Research continues to underscore tha t social determinants of health ( SDOH ) \u2014 the conditions under which people live, learn, work and play \u2014 have a significant impact on a person's ability to access care and maintain health. SMV joined the CIE pilot partnership to provide more informed, holis tic care to patients with challenges to health equity , and to connec t them directly to community resources to meet those needs. Approximately 130 CIE community partners \u2014 including health care organizations, the County of San Diego Health and Human Servic es Agency, housing networks, food banks and other social service age ncies \u2014 use an integrated technology platform to support proactive, holistic, person -centered care. Shared records enable CIE partners to evaluate an individual's SDOH needs and utilizatio n history of community services and to make direct referrals to crit ical, community -based resources. SMV case managers and social workers were trained on CIE to better serve vulnerable patients, including patients who experience economic instability, food insecurity, and other hardships. Although delays and obstacles to C IE implementation and adoption persisted due to the COVID -19 pandemic during Year 3 of the CIE pilot, utilization metrics were sustained after demonstrating growth between Years 1 and 2. Community members across SDC were assisted through the CIE including residents of Downtown, Mission Valley, Southeast San Diego, Encanto, El Cajon, Lakeside, La Mesa, Otay Mesa, National Vista, Carlsbad, Escondido and Oceanside. The top communit y referrals provided to patients through the CIE included utilities, food, housing and economic support. Sharp teams continue to work closely with 2 -1-1 on the implementation and data integration plans for CIE, which includes evaluation of ongoing metrics , such as system Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 344 utilization of CIE, referral tracking, case managem ent efficiency, successful connection to community referrals and more. Data will be used to re -evaluate the value and sustainability of CIE for Sharp upon completion of the pilot's fourth year. FY 202 3 Plan SMV or SMC will do the following:436 Provide free psychiatric assessments, substance use screenings and referrals for the community Participate in psychiatric rehabilitation programs and activities in the community Explore furt her opportunities to collabor ate with community organizations Increase engagement and collaboration with SPC to provide education on decreasing and preventing suicide in SDC Increase education, support and engagement related to the opioid epidemic, including community distribution of free opioid overdose prevention k its Host and facilitate various virtual support groups and provide free meeting space for community self -help groups Explore the reinstatement of weekly food donations to the San Diego Rescue Mission Participate in 2 -1-1's CIE program to serve patients who experience health equity barriers by connecting them to critical community services Identified Community Need: Improving Behavioral Health Outcomes for At-Risk Seniors Rationale references the fin dings of the SMV and SM C 20 22 CHNAs, HASD&IC 20 22 CHNA or the most recent SDC community health statistics unless otherwise indicated. Rationale The HASD&IC, SMV and SMC 2022 CHNA processes identified behavioral health and issues that affect care and support during the aging pr ocess among the priority health and social needs affecting community members in SDC. A primary theme across HASD&IC's CHNA interviews and focus groups was social and geographic isolation during the COVID -19 pandemic, which has r esulted in greater depressi on, anxiety and cognitive decline among seniors. Hospital clinicians who participated in HASD&IC's community engagement activities emphasized that it is increasingly difficult for seniors with behavioral health challenges to acc ess services due to the lac k of available resources. S killed nursing facilitie s have limited willingness and capacity to accept patients with behavioral health diagnoses and there are few placement options for dementia patients with behavioral health issue s. Older adults who struggl e to access needed services may use substances as a coping mechanism, and clinicians described recent increases in substance use among seniors, including alcohol, prescription drugs and illegal substances, such as methamphetamine . Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 345 The HASD&IC 2022 CHNA als o found that geriatric psychiatry resources are extremely limited and there is a high need for geropsychiatric care professionals to keep up with the expanding health care needs of the growing senior population. HASD&IC 2022 CHNA community engagement parti cipants described stigma as preventing many seniors from accessing critical programs and support. Older adults can be especially reluctant to seek help or admit they are experiencing behavioral health challenges, especially those in specific demographic gr oups such as Native American elders, seniors experiencing homelessness, and LGBTQ+ seniors. Respondents ages 65 and older in the Sharp Insight Community survey conducted during Sharp's 2022 CHNAs reported increased anxiety or de pression and decreased acce ss to in -person behavioral health care due to the pandemic. Analysis of hospital discharge data for SMV showed that one -third (33.3%) of seniors admitted to SMV in 2020 had a principal diagnosis that was classified as a mood dis order, while 22.7% of diagn oses were classified as an alcohol -related disorder, and 15% as dementia. In addition, while individuals identified as White represented 53.3% of all inpatient discharges at SMV, they accounted for 69% of discharges among seniors . Data analysis also found that the top three behavioral health diagnoses were suicidal ideations, alcohol dependence with withdrawal, and major depressive disorder (recurrent and severe). In addition, nearly a fifth (18.2%) of senior inpatients at SMV ha d a diagnosis related to Alzheimer's disease or dementia. In 2020, Alzheimer's disease was the fifth leading cause of death in SDC, fourth in the state of California, and seventh in the U.S.424,425 In 2019, adults age s 65 and older experienced the highest rates of hospitalization for Alzheimer's disease, mood disorders and schizophrenia when compared to all other age groups in SDC.427 Assuming curr ent trends continue, by 2030, nearly 115,000 SDC residents 55 years and older will be living with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, representing a 36.5% increase from 2015.441 The Alzheimer's Association projects that, by 2025, there will be approxi mately 840,000 Californians age 65 and older living with Alzheimer's disease, a 21.7% increase from 2020.442 In 2021, 9% of SDC adults over the age of 65 thought about committing suicide in the past year. In addition, 47.2% of SDC seniors who reported having mental/emotional or substance use issues sought help for those issues but did not receive treatment.423 In 2019, there were 700 ED visits for alcohol -related disorders among SDC seniors. The rate of alcohol -related ED visits was 148.0 per 100,000 population.427 The 2019 hospitalization rate for acute substance -related disorders was 8.7 per 100,000 among SDC residents over the age of 65. Nearly a quarter of adults a ges 65 and older are considered to be socially isolated. Social isolation can negatively impact physical and mental health in many ways, 441 County of San Diego HHSA, PHS , CHSU (2018), Alzheimer 's Disease and Related Dementias in Diego County . 442 Alzheimer's Association (2022), 2022 Alzheimer's Disease F acts and Figures . Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 346 including increased risk of premature death; significantly greater risk of dementia, heart disease and stroke; and high er rates of depression, anxiety and suicide.443 Social isolation presents a significant behavioral health concern among older adults experiencing homelessness. In 2020, almost half of surveyed older adults (45%) in SDC reported feeling lonely, isolated or c ut off from friends and family. Research indica tes that lack of access to technology, low digital health literacy, and design barriers in patient portals and apps have disproportionately affected older adults during the COVID -19 pandemic, especially those in underserved communities.444 According to the National Institute on Aging, social isolation and loneliness have been linked to a variety of physical and behavioral health conditions, including high blood pressure, heart disease, obesity, a weakened immune system, anxiety, depression, cognitive decline , Alzheimer's disease and even death. People who find themselves unexpectedly alone due to the death of a spouse or partner, separation from friends or family, retirement, loss of mobility, and lack of transpor tation are at particularly high risk.445 Objec tives Provide culturally competent outreach services to vulnerable seniors in communities with barriers to health equity Provide education and screenings to senior community members Collaborate with community o rganizations to address the behavioral health needs of seniors and other community members with health equity barriers FY 202 2 Report of Activities In FY 202 2, SMV clinicians collaborated with Serving Seniors to provide more than 700 hours of on-site clinical services to clients at the Gary and Ma ry West Senior Wellness Center. Seniors received a variety of early intervention services, including health assessments; referrals for prescriptions or medication adjustment; referrals or counseling to reduce th e risk of hospitalization or homelessness; an d behavioral health screenings, including Montreal Cognitive Assessments, which detect cognitive impairment. When appropriate, seniors also received crisis intervention and initiation of treatment at a higher le vel of care. In addition to these services , SMV continued to collaborate with Serving Seniors to provide behavioral health telemedicine to clients and to offer home -based outreach and services to seniors living at Potiker Family Senior Residence in East Vi llage and Potiker City Heights Residence. SMV also continued to collaborate with the Gary and Mary West Senior Wellness Center beyond the provision of clinical services. Both on -site and virtually, SMV provided free prevention and early intervention init iatives for vulnerable, culturally 443 CDC Division of Population Health, National Center for Chronic Disease Preventio n and Health Promotion (2021), Lone liness and Social Isolation Linked to Serious Health Conditions . 444 Fulmer, T., Reuben, D.B., Johnson, K.S.

Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 347 diverse se niors. Programs were designed to improve the utilization and effectiveness of behavioral health services and address barriers to accessing care, including stigma, isolation and lack of available services. Servic es were enhanced by case management as well a s free psychoeducation and support for staff, seniors and families . In addition , an SMV clinician led a weekly healthy aging support group focused on aging and behavioral health issues, including depression, anx iety and coping with loss. Held at the Gary and Mary West Senior Wellness Center, Potiker Family Senior Residence and Potiker City Heights Residence, the su pport group served nearly 510 community seniors in FY 202 2. Further, an SMV clinician hosted biweekl y virtual meetings with Serving Seniors staff to help support mental health and wellness in the workplace. Throughout the year, clinicians from SMV's SIOP provided community education and outreach to debunk the myths associated with older adulthood, such as \"depression is a normal part of aging' and 'growing old is characterized by loss and pain. \" At San Diego Oasis' Grossmont Life long Learning Center, c linicians delivered presentations on topics including tips to keep your brain healthy as you age and men tal health over the holidays. Also in FY 2022, SMV's SIOP partnered with SCHHC and the Spreckels Center to provide a series of pr esentations on mental and brain health for the Coronado community. Topics included understanding mental health for older adults ; self -care tips for caregivers; brain health during the aging process; and stress relief. Throughout the year, SMV's SIOP prov ided behavioral health resources and information about the hospital's senior services at virtual senior health fairs and commun ity events . In March, a clinician from SMV's SIOP presented on caring for one's mental health to approximately 15 attendees at th e Spring into Healthy Living event at McGrath Family YMCA in Spring Valley. At the Caregiver Coalition of San Diego's virtual L et's Talk About Mental Health conference in May, an SIOP clinician provided a lecture titled Care for the Caregiver to approximat ely 20 participants. In FY 202 2, SMV partnered with Alzheimer's San Diego to provide screenings, behavioral health education and resources to community members. In June, SMV sponsored Alzheimer's San Diego's virtual Date with a Cure event \u2014 a free, annua l event that brings together SDC's best and brightest Alzheimer's researchers and institutions to answer community members' que stions about dementia . An SMV clinician also participated in a panel discussion about recent advances in Alzheimer's treatment during the event , which was attended by approximately 400 community members . Throughout FY 2022 , SMV provided free memory scre enings \u2014 a wellness tool that identifies possible changes in memory and cognition \u2014 to approximately 225 community members who we re concerned about memory loss or interested in establishing a baseline to detect future changes. Screening locations included SMV's Clinical Research Center , the Alzheimer's San Diego office, Bay Terraces Community and Senior Center, Chula Vista Public Li brary, Consulate General of Mexico San Diego Office, Nestor Community Park, Scripps Ranch Library, San Ysidro Public Library, Coronado Library and Mission Valley YMCA . Additionally , SMV clinician s provided memory screenings, educational materials on Alzhei mer's research and information on Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 348 opportunities to enroll in clinical research studies to more than 800 community members at se veral community events, including the Sharp Women's Health Conference, the City of National City's Senior Saturday event, the Alo ha Run, Gente Bonita magazine's Healthy Living Expo 2022 and the Sharp Aging Conference. An SMV clinician also provided a webin ar to participants in the Emeritus Program at San Diego City College, which provides adults ages 55 and older with a variety of l earning and socialization opportunities. The webinar, which included information about SMV's research programs and memory scree ns, as well as general information about the importance of clinical trials, was shared with approximately 1,300 Emeritus Program enrollees. FY 202 3 Plan SMV will do the following:436 In collaboration with Se rving Seniors, provide outreach and education to seniors without stable housing Address the behavioral health needs of vulnerable, culturally diverse seniors Through SMV's SIOP , provide education and support to community members around senior behavioral he alth issues Collaborate with community organizations to address the behavioral health needs of SDC seniors and community members with barriers to health equity Identified Community Need: Behavioral Health and Substance Use Educat ion for Health Care Prof essionals and Students, and Collaboration with Local Schools to Promote Interest and Career Pathways in Behavioral Health Rationale references the findings of the SMV and SMC 20 22 CHNAs, HASD&IC 20 22 CHNA or the most recent SDC com munity health statistics unless otherwise indicated. Rationale The HASD&IC 2022 CHNA identified workforce shortages as a foundational challenge that greatly exacerbates the priority health and social needs (access to health care, aging care & support, be havioral health, childre n & youth well -being, chronic health conditions, community safety and economic stability) affecting community members served by SMV and SMC. Workforce shortages were described by HASD&IC 2022 CHNA community engagement participants a s the number one priorit y for local health care providers. The pandemic has severely strained the existing health care workforce, and staffing shortages have exacerbated challenges in meeting the demand for community services. All health care settings, inc luding behavioral health , were described as understaffed, and workforce shortages can adversely impact the patient experience. Further, the workforce shortage is creating a wider equity gap, with fewer culturally Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 349 competent and linguistically appropriate pr oviders available to car e for SDC's diverse communities. Nearly 90% of IPH Sharp Provider Survey participants reported that COVID -19 had at least a moderate impact in employees' desire to change careers or leave the workforce, which may create challenges in meeting the health car e needs of the community. Of these, the majority (78%) reported that Sharp does not have programs or services available to address this issue. According to a report titled Health Workforce Strategies for California, studies conducted over the past four dec ades demonstrate that multi -component pipeline programs for high school, college and post -baccalaureate students underrepresented in the health professions positively impact a variety of outcomes with the potential to im prove the diversity of the health ca re workforce.446 Although California has enacted various policies to increase both the size and the diversity of the health workforce, current public and private sector efforts have not been sufficient to alleviate exist ing shortages.446 From September 2021 to September 2022, the number of designated Mental Health Care Health Professional Shortage Areas (HPSA) in California increased 3.5%. The state's 598 Mental Health Care HPSAs represent approximately 13.1 mil lion residents. The Kaiser Family Foundation estimates that 674 new practitioners would need to be added to the behavioral health workforce to rem ove HPSA designation from all areas.447 The 2021 California Behavioral Health Workforce Assessment suggests seve ral recommendations to expand, elevate, enhance, and empower the behavioral health workforce in every California community. Recommendations inclu de supporting data-driven decision -making and policy; increasing racial, ethnicity, linguistic, and cultural di versity among behavioral health providers; increasing pay and benefits; addressing burnout and compassion fatigue; prioritizing support for unser ved, underserved, and inappropriately served communities; providing telehealth training and assistance; and inv esting in peer support programs.448 San Diego's regional behavioral health system currently employs approximately 17,000 professionals in 11 high priority occupations \u2014 roughly 8,000 workers less than the number needed to meet existing demand. Based on curre nt trends, the San Diego region will need to educate, train, attract, employ and retain an additional 18,500 professionals between 2022 and 2027 .449 Suggested strategies to address the behavioral health workforce shortage include investing in competitive com pensation; pursuing relief related to administrative requirements; building a regional workforce training fund; establishing regional workforce training centers of excellence; and continuing to listen to the voices of workers and students.449 In 2022, 43% of U.S. adults who say they needed substance use or mental health care in the past 12 months did not receive care, with the majority of these individuals reporting an impact on their life due to the lack of car e.

Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 350 receive treatment in the past 12 months, 26% of those who received substance use care and 23% of those who received mental health care reported reaching out to several different providers before finding one that was accepting new pat ients.450 According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment of social workers, including clinical and behavioral health social workers, is projected to grow 9% from 2021 to 2031, much faster than the average for all occupations. Employment of substance use, behavioral disorder and mental health counselors is anticipated to increase 22%. Demand for employment in these occupations is expected to increase as greater numbers of people seek treatment for mental illness and SUDs , and as insurance polici es provide greater coverage for addiction and behavioral health services.451 Additionally, substance use, behavioral disorder, and mental health counselors experienced an increase in demand due to behavioral health impacts related to the COVID -19 pandemic.451 As the criminal justice system increasingly recognizes treatment for SUDs as a cost - effective alternative to incarceration, use of substance use programs is likely to increase as states opt t o sentence offen ders experiencing drug and substance use issues to treatment and counseling services rather than jail.451 In a survey of 500 licens ed mental health providers, over 90% of respondents reported changes to their e mployment (e.g., furloughs) following the onset of the pandemic, and almost two -thirds made the decision to stop practicing entirely. Among those who continued practicing during the pandemic, 62% reported similar - to-increased caseloads, new patients seekin g services, and increased appointment frequency. Almost all (97%) providers used telemedicine, with about half (54%) providing services mostly -to-exclusively via telemedicine. 452 Objectives Collaborate with local schools to promote interest and provide career pathways in health care Collaborate with the behavioral health community \u2014 including other behavioral health educational institutions \u2014 to provide education and training for health care professionals FY 202 2 Report of Activities Throughout the ye ar, SMV participated in internship and clinical training programs for trainees and students in various health care disciplines, including psychology, clinical social work, social work administration, MFT, pharmacy, clinical chaplaincy, medicine and nursing .

Amid the ongoing COVID -19 pandemic , psychology and practicum (MFT and Master of Social Work (MSW)) students continued to perform a critical role in the provision of patient care at SMV. Students earned valuable hands -on experience while supporting SMV staff during this time of unprecedented behavioral health need. SMV also worked with its s tudent population to adjust learning expectations and opportunities as needed, including providing virtual education. Throughout FY 202 2, SMV provided clinical supervision and training for 26 psychology trainees, including 14 graduate students, eight docto ral interns and four behavioral health therapists, as well as 20 MFT, nine MSW and five Bachelor of Social Work (BSW) student interns. In FY 202 2, ancillary (non-nursing) students served nearly 53,000 hours on the SMV campus. In addition, nearl y 310 nursing students spent nearly 22,000 hours working clinical rotations of six - to eight - hour shifts in all inpatient units and several of the outpatient programs at SMV and SMC. SMV offers two clinical rotations in one day, including morning and even ing shifts , and nursing students are on campus seven days a week. Including time spent with groups and individual preceptors, nursing students served approximately 23,200 hours at SMV in FY 202 2. In FY 202 2, SMV received more than 200 applications for ei ght doctor al intern positions available through Sharp's yearlong, American Psychological Association accredited doctoral internship in clinical psychology. Interns completed three , four-month rotations that included experience in SMV's ient progr ams, including adult, senior , and child and adolescent behavioral health programs. Interns also rotated through SMC. The hospitals offered interns a unique opportunity to receive intensive training in psychological assessment and neuropsychologic al screeni ng. With this training, psychology doctoral students provided approximately 130 detailed psycho - diagnostic assessments throughout the year. In addition, psychology trainees provided more than 8,700 hours of group therapy and approximately 2,200 hours of in dividual therapy. Psychology trainees were also integrally involved in clinical staff training as well as program development and evaluation efforts throughout the hospital. SMV also continued to mentor behavioral health therapist trainees duri ng FY 202 2, allowing the hospital to provide clinical programming on its inpatient units seven days per week. At SMV and SMC, psychologists, licensed MFTs and licensed clinical social worker s provided thousands of hours of direct clinical supervision to trainees. SM V clinicians provided two hours of virtual lectures every week for psychology doctoral interns. These lectures were also open to trainees and staff throughout the hospital. Lectures included, but were not limited to: Acceptance and Commitment T herapy (ACT) with Older Adults ; Addressing Substance Use Disorders and Treatment ; Assessing Psychosis in Children and Adolescents; Art Therapy ; Assessment and Treatment of Behavioral Disturbance in Dementia; Assessment and Treatment of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder ; Assessment and Treatment of Self Injurious Behaviors ; Child Abuse and Tarasoff Reporting ; Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 352 Community Health Needs Assessment ; Culturally and Clinically Competent Work With Transgendered People ; Discharge Planning and Utilization Review ; Evaluatin g Complex Trauma in Children ; Evaluating Personality Disorders in Adolescents ; Giving and Receiving Feedback in a Professional Setting ; Integrating Music Therapy with CBT and ACT; Mindfulness and Self -Care ; Motivational Interview Training ; Psychological Treatment of F unctional Gastrointestinal Disorders ; Providing Trans -affirmative Care ; Rapid Case Conceptualization and Brief Intervention ; Recovery Model and Aging ; Sex and Aging ; Self-Compassion Interventions; Speaking up for Safety ; and Working with Interp reters . Throughout the year, SMV's Inpatient Social Services Department provided specialized learning opportunities for seven MSW and BSW students. These students attended 20 hours of orientation sessions to become familiar with inpatient psychiatric social servic es. During the first semester, students spent two months shadowing and being observed by their field instructors before having the opportunity to work more independently under supervision. Students attended case presentations, in -services, staff meetings, multidisciplinary treatment team meetings, staff huddles and other learning activities as part of their experience. Students were provided an in -depth, immersive and highly supportive experience working directly with patients, families or care partners, as well as community partners to collaborate and provide patient - centered care. By the end of their internship, each student completed over 500 hours of direct practice. MFT practicum trainees, along with MSW and BSW interns at SMV worked specifically with patients receiving outpatient care. These trainees were onboarded for two days prior to beginning the program and received weekly individual and group supervision from SMV clinicians. Students also attended quarterly training sessions on topics including s uicide risk assessments, trauma -informed care, navigating licensure processes and working affirmatively with the LGBTQ+ community. Students received instruction and hands -on experience in a variety of activities, such as group, individual and family therap y; conducting psychosocial and suicide risk assessments; conducting intake evaluations; creating and updating treatment plans; and training in electronic medical records and completing patient charts in adherence with Joint Commission standards. SMV and SMC provided continuing education and training for behavioral health care professionals and students in FY 2022. In October, a n SMV nurse participated in the Philippine Nurses Association of San Diego County 's (PNASD) virtual Fall Education Day. The nurse participated in a panel discussion titled Mental and Neurological Health: Nurses as Health Advocates, which reached approximately 100 event attendees. In March, this included a lecture on mental health and older adults, which an SIOP clinician delivered to 30 community health providers at Elderhelp San Diego. An SMV clinical psychologist also provided virtual lectures to college students at CSUSM, SDSU and PLNU, on topics such as how to select appropriate internship sites, CBT skills and other tools to use with patients, and how to treat eating disorders. Throughout FY 2022, SMV also provided behavioral health resources to approximately 260 social work and Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 353 behavioral health students at virtual internship fairs hosted by APU, CSUSM, National University , PLNU, SD SU and USD. In collaboration with SDSU, SMV clinicians shared knowledge and best practices with the larger health care community through the development of educational materials on behavioral health care and participation in clinical research. In FY 202 2, SMV continued to assist with the development of geriatric behavioral health and dementia care curricula for SDSU's Responsive Integrated Health Solutions, a County of San Diego Behavioral Health -contracted program within SDSU's Academy for Profess ional Ex cellence. In addition, a clinical psychologist from SMV published an article titled Enhancing Social Initiations Using Naturalistic Behavioral Intervention: Outcomes from a Randomized Controlled Trial for Children with Autism in the Journal of Auti sm & Dev elopmental Disorders , and an SMV clinician leader published an article titled Opioid Use Treatment and Recovery Services During Pregnancy in the Journal of the American Psychiatric Nurses Association . The Sharp Neurocognitive Research Center at SM V also c ontributes to the expansion of scientific knowledge and medical advancements throughout the larger health and research communities . In FY 202 2, SMV provided clinical trials to improve care and outcomes for patients experiencing Alzheimer's disease and othe r cognitive disorders . Throughout FY 2022, staff at SMV and SMC regularly led or attended various community and professional health boards, committees, and advisory and work groups, including A New PATH, Alzheimer's San Diego Community Advisory Council, Association for Ambulator y Behavioral Healthcare, Association of Black Psychologists - San Diego Chapter, Association for Contextual Behavioral Science - Aging in Context Special Interest Group, Live Well San Diego Check Your Mood Committee, CHIP Behavioral Health Work Team, CHIP ILA Work Team, CHIP SPC, CHIP SPC Media, Means Restriction and Higher Education Subcommittees , HASD&IC, JFS Behavioral Health PERT, PNASD , PLNU, San Diego County Older Adult Behavioral Health System of Care Council, north San Diego Coalition for Mental Health, San Diego Psychological Association Membership and Public Education Media Committees, and Special Needs Trust Foundation.

SRSMC is operated by Sharp Rees -Stealy Medical Group (SRSMG), one of the region's largest and most comprehensive medical groups. SRSM G is not required to develop a community benefit plan as part of Senate Bill 697, nor is S RSMG required to conduct a community health needs assessment (CHNA). However, as a division of Sharp HealthCare (Sharp), SRSMC engaged in a variety of activities that provided direct benefit to the San Diego community during FY 202 2, a selection of which are hig hlighted in this section. Key highlights: Other Benefits for Vulnerable Populations included shuttle transportation for patients to and from medical appointments; financial assistance for pharmaceutical costs; assistance for patients experiencing food in security; contribution of time to Feeding San Diego; the Sharp Humanitarian Service Program; and other assistance for vulnerable community members. Other Benefits for the Broader Community included education and resources on a variety of health topics; pa rticipation in community health fairs and events; support groups; health screenings for skin ca ncer; and community education and resources provided by Sharp Rees -Stealy Center for Health Management and Education. SRSMC and SRSMG staff actively participated in professional and community boards, committees and other civic organizations, including Amer ica's Physician Groups (APG) , Integrated Healthcare Association (IHA), North San Diego Business Chamber and Climate Action Campaign Public Health Advisory Counci l. See Appendix A for a listing of Sharp 's involvement in community organizations in FY 2022. The category also includes costs associated with community benefit planning and administration. Health Research, Education and Train ing Programs included time devoted to education and training of health care professionals, student and intern supervision, Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 358 and time devoted to generalizable health -related research projects that were made available to the broader health care community. Definition of Community For a map of SRSMC locations, visit https://www.sharp.com/locations/search/sharp - rees-stealy SRSMC serves all of San Diego County (SDC); however, the primary c ommunities served include the City of San Diego, Chula Vista, SDC's east region and the North Inland communities surrounding Rancho Bernardo. See Appendix B for a map of community and region boun daries in SDC. Description of C ommunity Health In 2022 , there were 525,919 residents age s 65 and older in SDC, representing 15. 8% of the population. Between 2022 and 2027 , it is anticipated that SDC's senior population will grow by 14.1%.453 In 2020 , 10.9% of the SDC population reported living below 100% of the federal poverty level (FPL). The county's unemployment rate was 5.9% and 5. 1% of households received Supplemental Security Income.454 According to the San Diego Hunger Coalition, while nutrition insecurity455 has declined since 2021, high rates remain due to long -standing economic disparities that were exacerbated by the COVID -19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic . As of March 2022, 28% of San Diegans experienced nutrition insecurity and 35% of children lived in nutrition -insecure ho useholds.456 In 2020 , 7.1% of households in SDC received Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, while 16.7% of the population lived at or below 138% FPL and were eligible for the program.454 Please refer to Table 58 for SNAP participation and eligibility in SDC. 453 SpeedTrack\u00a9, Inc. ; U.S. Census Bureau. 454 The County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency (HHSA), Public Health Servi ces (PHS), Community Healt h Statistics Unit (CHSU) , December 2022, U.S. Census Bureau, 2016 -2020 American Community Survey 5 -year estimates. 455 U.S. Department of Agriculture (2022), Food and Nu trition Security.

NCQA Population Health Program Accreditation helps organizations align their operations with industry best practices in population health management. In compliance with NCQA stand ards, SRSMG conducts a population health assessment annually to identify the characteristics and needs of its member population, including data on social determinants of health (SDOH) \u2014 the conditions under which people live, learn, work and play . The assessment findings are used to identify population changes and establish priorities for program support. The annual population assessment inform s guidelines and resource planning for program ming to address chronic health conditions and case management. Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 362 SRSMG's annual assessment also uses the Dignity Health/IBM Watson Health Community Needs Index (CNI) to identify communities of need within their p atient population. This is the same CNI tool used in Sharp's hospital -based CHNAs to identify communities with greater health inequities as determined through an analysis of specific barriers to health care access, including education, income, culture/lang uage, insurance and housing . The CNI demonstrates the link between community need, access to care and preventa ble hospitalizations. SRSMG's most recent population health assessment462 identified the following characteristics and health needs for its patient population: Nearly half (47. 5%) of SRSMG patients reside in communities of highest need in SDC . Further, 56.9% of patients with diabetes, 51.9% of patients with hypertension and 58.9% of patients who had a stroke reside in these communities. Among SRSMG 's senior patients, 4 2.4% have multiple (two or more) chronic health conditions. Patients identified as Hispanic or Latino accounted for 2 1% of SRSMG patients in 2022, but represented 3 1% of patients with diabetes and 2 9% of stroke patients . Among SRSMG pa tients with a behavioral health encounter in 2022, the top three diagnosis catego ries were anxiety or stress disorders , substance use disorders , and mood disorders . SRSMG's Population Health Department promotes resources and community programs to patients residing in those communities (ZIP codes) of higher need . Patients residing in ZIP codes of highest need are sent an outreach letter containing information about available community resources to address a broad range of issues , including food, financial, housing and other types of socioeconomic assistance . Patients in these communities are also provided with the department's contact information should they require further as sistance in accessing community resources. Please refer to Section 1 (Overview): Patient Access to Care Programs for additional entity and systemwide programs designed to address access to health care. Identified Community Need: Health Education, Support and Wellness Rationale references the findings of the Sharp 20 22 CHNAs, Hospital Association of San Diego and Imperial Counties 20 22 CHNA or the most recent San Diego County (SDC) community health statistics unless otherwise indicated. Rationale The Hospital Association of San Diego and Imperial Countie s (HASD&IC ) and Sharp 2022 CHNAs identified access to health care, aging care & support, behavioral health, children & youth well -being, chronic health conditions, community safety, and economic stability as the top community needs affecting people served by SRSMC . 462 Sharp Rees-Stealy Medical Group published its most recent population health assessment on February 3, 202 3. This assessment covers the period from December 1, 202 1 through November 30, 202 2. Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 363 HASD&IC's community engagement efforts described health literacy as a barrier in accessing health care. To help people understand basic health information, there is a need for more education on preventive health care, healthy lifestyles, and unde rstanding the differences between sources of care (e.g., when to use urgent care v ersus the emergency room). Participants noted that health care settings should use simple, plain language forms to help people understand health information. Also, according to the HASD&IC 2022 CHNA, the pandemic further exacerbated existing health literacy challenges, such as people not understanding their health insurance benefits, not knowing whom to call to access services, and difficulty identifying where to ge t care. The majority (96%) of Sharp Insight Community Survey respondents did not participate in Sharp's programs to connect individuals to support services or resources, which suggests that more can be done to promote community awareness about these serv ices. Amon g those who did participate, programs accessed included: diabetes care and education programs (12%) , nutrition programs (6%) and weight management programs (6%). Data analysis in Sharp's 2022 CHNAs revealed a higher volume of hospital discharges due to ca rdiovascular disease and Type 2 diabetes in communities facing greater socioeconomic challenges throughout SDC.463 In 2020, diseases of the heart were the second leading cause of death for SDC.460,461 According to 2021 CHIS data, 26.1% of SDC residents had ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure, while 6.7% had borderline high blood pressure. In addition, 21.7% of SDC adults reported being obese .459 In California, the self -reported obesity rate in 2021 was 27.6%. Prevalence of obesity decreased as education levels increased, highlighting the need for health education as a tool for reducing obesity rates .464 A study pub lished in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 's (CDC ) Morbidity and Mortality Weekly suggests that risks of COVID -19-related hospitalizatio n, intensive care unit admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, and death are higher with increasing body mass index , particularly among adults under the age of 65.465 According to the CDC, the leading causes of preventable death include obesity - related conditions, such as heart disease, stroke, Type 2 diabetes and some types of cancer .466 According to the art icle Social and Environmental Factors Influencing Obesity , obes ity prevalence is significantly associated with sex, racial or ethnic identity, and socioeconomic status. Higher odds of obesity are attributed to multiple factors, including environments exper iencing deprivation, disorder, or high crime; proliferation of high calorie, energy dense food options that are perceived as more 463 Dignity Health and IBM Watson Health Community Need Index (2022). 464 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (2022), Adult Obesity Prevalence Maps . 465 Kompaniyets L, Goodman AB, Belay B, et al.

Due to the COVID -19 pandemic, the percent of SDC's population experiencing nutrition insecurity increased to a p eak of 39% (1.3 million people) in April 2020, then leveled of f to 30% (1 million people) in November 2020. As of June 2021, nutrition insecurity continued to affect nearly 1 in 3 SDC residents.468 As of September 2022, more than 1 in 4 SDC residents (83.2% ) is vaccinated against COVID -19.469 Recent data suggests the COVID -19 vaccine's effectiveness at preventing infection or severe illness wanes over time, especially for people ages 65 and older and those who are immunocompromised. The CDC recommends COVID -19 vaccines for everyone ages 6 months and older, and boosters for everyone 5 years and older, if eligible. Data show that an mRNA booster increases the immune response, which improves protection against getting a serious COVID -19 infection.470 In 2021, 29.5 % of SDC residents living below 200% of the FPL reported enrollment in the CalFresh program. 459 In 2021, the self -reported smoking rate in SDC was 6.1%.459 Accordi ng to the CDC, quitting smoking improves health status and enhances quality of life; reduces the risk of premature death; reduces the ri sk of many adverse health effects and chronic conditions; has specific benefits for people diagnosed with coronary heart disease or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; benefits pregnant women and their fetuses and babies; and reduces financial burdens o n people who smoke, health care systems, and society .471 According to the American Journal of Lifestyle Management, culin ary medicine is an emerging discipline which aims to positively affect public health by improving eating behaviors through integrating nutritional science with food preparation. The intention is to help create positive behavior change by not just providing knowledge, but by teaching specific skills that may aid in creating lasting change. Culinary medicine uses an evidence -based approach that includes simple nutrition education and instruction in nutritious cooking skills, including shopping, meal planning and preparation, and food storage.472 Objectives Host community education classes addressing chronic conditions and other identified health needs as well as wellness and disease prevention Provide health education , screenings and resources at community -sponsored health fairs and events 467 Lee A., Cardel M., & Donahoo W.T.

FY 202 3 Plan SRSMC will do the following:473 Provide education for community members on a variety of health topics , with a focus on lifestyle medicine, wellness and disease prevention Provide health education, screenings and first -aid services at community events 473 Where applicable, S harp Rees-Stealy Medical Centers will perform these activities as COVID -19 (coronavirus disease 2019) public health and safety guidelines allow. Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 368 Identified Com munity Need: Health Professions Education and Training, and Collaboration with Local Schools to Promote Interest and Career Pathways in Health Care Rationale references the findings of the Sharp 20 22 CHNAs, HASD&IC 2022 CHNA or the most recent SDC communit y health statistics unless otherwise indicated. Rationale The HASD&IC 2022 CHNA identified workforce shortages as a foundational challenge that greatly exacerbates the priority health needs (access to health care, aging care & support, behavior al health , children & youth well -being, chronic health conditions, community safety and economic stability) affecting members of the communities served by SMH. Workforce shortages were described by HASD&IC 2022 CHNA community engagement participants as the number o ne priority for local health care providers. The pandemic has severely strained the existing health care workforce, and staffing shortages have exacerbated challenges in meeting the demand for community services. All health care settings, includin g behavio ral health, were described as understaffed, and workforce shortages can adversely impact the patient experience. Further, the workforce shortage is creating a wider equity gap, with fewer culturally competent and linguistically appropriate provide rs availa ble to care for SDC's diverse communities. The Institute for Public Health's ( IPH) Sharp Provider and Sharp Human Resources surveys conducted as part of the SMH 2022 CHNA process identified several educational topics of particular interest and imp ortance t o employee professional development, including: defining cultural humility and applying it to health care; the impact of implicit or unconscious bias on decision -making; maternal and infant health with a focus on the Black community; and health di sparities among various groups, including the Black, Asian, Latinx and immigrant communities. Nearly 90% of IPH Sharp Provider Survey participants reported that COVID -19 had at least a moderate impact in employees' desire to change careers or leave the workforce, w hich may create challenges in meeting the health care needs of the community. Of these, the majority (78%) reported that Sharp does not have programs or services available to address this issue. The San Diego Workforce Partnership (SDWP) reported that, in 2021, there were 186,000 people employed in the health care sector in SDC, accounting for 13% of all jobs countywide.474 SDWP also cites research by the University of Washington Center for Women's Welfare that estimates the basic needs of a single adult res ident of SDC to cost $3,058.72 per month, requiring full -time employment at $17.65 an hour. Of the 20 most common occupations in SDC's health care sector, there are 11 with training requirements less than or equal to an associate degree that can provide ne w graduates with a living wage.474 474 San Diego Workforce Partnership (2021), Expanding Access to Healthcare Jobs in San D iego County: Healthcare Sector Overview . Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 369 Total employment in California is projected to grow 16% between 2020 and 2030, reflecting an increase of 2.8 million jobs statewide over the decade. The educational services (private), healt h care and social assistance sector is expected to be one of the fastest -growing industries in California, with 19.0% growth anticipated.475 According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' Employment Projections - 2021 - 2031 report, employme nt in health ca re and social assistance is projected to add about 2.6 million jobs from 2021 to 2031 \u2014 the highest growth among all industry sectors. Factors that are expected to contribute to this growth include rising demand for the care of an aging baby -boom populatio n, longer life expectancies and higher prevalence of chronic conditions.476 According to a report from the California Health Care Foundation (CHCF) titled California Physicians: A Portrait of Practice , the supplies of physicians, physician assistants and th ree types of advanced practice nurses in California grew between 2016 and 2020, while the supply of clinical nurse specialists decreased. The increased supply of licensed physicians does not accurately reflect the availability of care, howeve r \u2014 less than half of California's physicians provided care 40 or more hours per week.477 According to a report titled Health Workforce Strategies for California, studies conducted over the past four decades demonstrate that multi -component pipeline programs for high school, college and post -baccalaureate students underrepresented in the health professions positively impact a variety of outcomes with the potential to improve the diversity of the health care workforce.478 Although California has enacted various policies to increase both the size and the diversity of the health workforce, current public and private sector efforts have not been sufficient to alleviate existing shortages.478 The California Future Healt h Workforce Commission (CFHWC) has described several recent state budget and policy actions intended to address the significant health and economic impacts of the COVID -19 pandemic. This includes investments in the mental health workforce, particularly for those who work with children and youth; investments in physician residencies, with an emphasis on psychiatry; additional California Department of Health Care Acce ss and Information479 oversight for state -supported health workforce programs; expanding the sc ope of practice for nurse practitioners; and creating several new reimbursable provider types, such as community health workers.480 According to CFHWC key informant interviews with private sector health care leaders, California's workforce needs include incr easing workforce diversity; educating young Californians that futures in the health sector are appealing regardless of background, socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity, and gender; and partnering with schools and companies to remove barriers to continuing education and develop pipelines for jobs.481 475 California Employment Development Department ( EDD) (2022), Employment Projections . 476 U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (2022), Employment Projections - 2021 -2031 . 477 California Health Care Foundation (CHCF) (2021), California Physician s, 2021: A Portrait of Practice . 478 CHCF (2021), Health Workforce Strategies for California: A review of the Evidence . 479 California's Department of H ealth Care Access and Information was formerly known as the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development . 480 California Future Health Workfor ce Commission (CFHWC) (2022), 2022 Update on Health Progress . 481 CFHWC (2020), Meeting the De mand for Health: Top Priorities, Challenges, and Proposed Actions for the Priv ate Sector to Support the Workforce California Needs . Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 370 A CHCF survey of frontline health care workers during COVID -19 reflects the sustained mental and emotional t oll of providing patient care during the pandemic. Six in 10 providers continue to feel overworked and b urned out, while nearly half are frustrated by their job. Nearly three out of four nurses (72%) say they feel burned out from their work \u2014 higher than t he 61% reported among nurse practitioners and physician assistants, 57% among doctors, and 56% among beh avioral health specialists.482 Objectives In collaboration with local schools, colleges and universities offer opportunities for students to explore an d train for a vast array of health care professions Collaborate with local schools to promote interest an d provide career pathways in health care Provide training for local and national health care professionals FY 202 2 Report of Activities In FY 202 2, SRSMC collaborated with local, state and national schools, colleges and universities to provide opportun ities for students to explore and train for a variety of careers in health care. SRSMC offered various placement and professional development opportun ities for students and interns throughout SDC. More than 100 nursing students, approximately 50 advanced practice provider students and nearly 100 ancillary (non -nursing) students from a variety of colleges and universities spent nearly 44,000 hours at SRSMC locations. Program partners included American Career College, Azusa Pacific University, Concorde Caree r College, California State University Sa n Marcos , Grand Canyon University, Grossmont College, Grossmont Health Occupations Center, Mesa College, MiraCosta College, Palomar Community College, Phlebotomy Training Academy, Pima Medical Institute, Samuel Merr itt University, San Diego State Universit y, Southern New Hampshire University, Southwestern College, Touro University, University of Massachusetts (UMass) Global ( formerly Brandman University), United States University, University of San Diego , Western Gov ernors University and Yale University. In FY 202 2, SRSMC served as the primary training location within the Sharp system for 52 advanced practice provider students, including individuals studying to become nurse practitioners and physician assistants. St udents represented a variety of specialti es, including dermatology , ear, nose and throat ( ENT), family medicine, medicine, OB-GYN, ophthalmology, palliative care , pediatrics , podiatry, pulmonary medicine and urgent care. Training was provided at s everal SRSMC facilities, including Carmel Valley, Del Mar, Genesee, La Mesa, Otay Ranch, Rancho Bernardo, San Diego, Santee, Scripps Ranch and Sorrento Mesa. Students specializing in urgent care also 482 CHCF (202 1), COVID -19 Tracking Poll, May 2021 Views f rom California Health Care Providers on the Front Lines . Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 371 had the opportunity to shadow physicians in all five Sha rp Rees -Stealy Urgent Care Centers. Also in FY 2022, SRSMC's Population Health Department provided hands -on training for a student intern from Southern New Hampshire University 's Master of Public Health practicum program. The intern worked directly with community health workers on a variety of tasks, including community outreach, distributing blood pressure cuffs and setting up patient appointments. Following a two -year hiatus due to the COVID -19 pandemic, in FY 2022, SRSMC welcomed back students from Health Sciences High and Middle Colleg e (HSHMC). This program prepares students in grades nine through 12 for future careers in health care through a combination of classroom learning and on -location job shadowing at various Sharp locations. In FY 2022, 20 HSHMC students spent time on campus a t SRSMC La Mesa, Santee and Genesee , where they rotated through departments including primary care, radiology, physical therapy and OB -GYN . Students spent time observing staff and assisted with tasks such as patient w ayfinding and clerical work . SRSMC shared knowledge and best practices with the larger professional health care community through the development of educational materials on patient care delivery. SRSMC leadership contributed an article titled Learning f rom the Pandemic: Virtual Care Takes Root in the Fall/Winter 2021 edition of The Journal of America's Physician Groups. In addition, SRSMG physicians from a variety of specialties participated in clinical research studies which were published in medical jo urnals throughout FY 2022, including Journal of Rheumatology , International Journal of Surgical Pathology , Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy , American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine , American Journal of Case Reports , Antibiotics , Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine , Journal of Infectious Diseases , Frontiers in Neurology , Pediatric Dermatology and Infection Control and Epidemiology. FY 202 3 Plan SRSMC will do the following:473 Provide profess ional development opportunities for health professions students and interns throughout SDC Provide one student from UMass Global's Department of Social Work Field Division with an internship focused on maternal child health and postpartum depression screen ing Collaborate with HSHMC to provide opportunities for high school students to explore careers in health care Share clinical research and best practices with the larger heal th care community Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 372 Identified Community Need: Access to Health Care and Communi ty and Social Support Rationale references the findings of the Sharp 2022 CHNA s, HASD&IC 20 22 CHNA or the most recent SDC community health statistics unless otherwise indicated. Rationale The HASD&IC and Sharp 2022 CHNAs identified access to health care and economic stability among the top community needs affecting people served by SRSMC , particularly underserved and underfunded patients who face inequities. The HASD&IC and SRSMC 2022 CHNAs identified the following themes related to accessing health care in SDC: overall barriers to care; the impact of telehealth; health literacy; transporta tion; health insurance and financial concerns; stigma; the needs of specific populations (LGBTQ+, people experiencing homelessness, individuals at the end of life, undoc umented individuals, and parents or caregivers); the need for trauma -informed care; and workforce challenges. HASD&IC 2022 CHNA participants also described the following logistical challenges related to accessing health care: making primary care appointme nts or accessing their usual source of care; insurance restrictions and confusion; a need for referrals to access certain services or treatments; finding the right fit with a provider; and timeliness related to level of care, such as locating after -hours u rgent care. Across HASD&IC's interviews and focus groups, there was a universal acknowledgment that the COVID -19 pandemic caused widespread disruption to SDC's local health care system. Factors impacting the ability to access health care included postpon ed or canceled procedures, long wait times for appointments and the fear of COVID -19 exposure. Nearly all (99%) IPH Sharp Provider Survey participants reported COVID -19 had an impact on patients' access to transportation, which may result in decreased ac cess to health care. Strategies to address this included increasing comm unity awareness about shuttle access or Sharp Van Services and providing telehealth. According to the HASD&IC 2022 CHNA, financial concerns may deter patients from accessing health ca re. Financial assistance to help pay for medical bills was described as a frequent and significant need.Community members are not always aware of low or no -cost programs that may be available to help pay for services. According to 2 -1-1 San Diego's (2 -1-1) Community Information Exchange (CIE) 2021 Client Profile Report, the top five needs for 2 -1-1 clients ages 60 and older were (in rank order): housing, utilities, income support and employment, consumer services and health care.483 In 2021 , 12.4% of SDC ad ults, teens and children reported having no usual source of health care . In addition, 19.7% of SDC residents reported that they had not visited a doctor at all in the previous year .459 According to San Diego Association of Governments ' 2021 COVID -19 Impacts report, the top three ways Californians reported spending their stimulus checks included food (22%), utilities (16%) and rent (14%) .484 483 2-1-1 San Diego Communit y Information Exchange (2021), Client Profile Report . 484 San Diego Association of Governments (2021), The San Diego Economy: A Year in Review of COVID -19 Impacts . Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 373 According to the San Diego Hunger Coalition, while nutrition insecurity has declined since 2021, high rates remain due to long -standing economic disparities that were exacerbated by the COVID -19 pandemic . As of March 2022 , more than 1 in 4 San Diegans experienced nutrition insecurity, with disproportionate impacts noted among communities of color .456 As of September 2022, the overall unemployment rate in SDC was 3.1%, which was lower than both the unemployment rate for the state of California (3.8%) and the national rate (3.5%) during the same period.485 According to the San Diego Regional Task Force on Homelessness' 2022 Point -in- Time Count, there was a 3% increase in SDC's unsheltered homeless population from 2020 to 2022. There were no fewer than 4,106 homeless individuals without shelter on a given night in 2022 compared to 3,971 in 2020. Of the 8,427 individuals experiencing homelessness in SDC in 2022, about half (51.2%) received some form of housing or services.486 In 2020, 1 in 4 unsheltered SDC residents were adults ages 55 and ove r. Among the region's unsheltered seniors, 88% became homeless in SDC and 43% reported experiencing homelessness for the first time in their lives.487 Nationwide, the population of individuals ages 65 and older experiencing homelessness is expected to nearly triple over the next decade \u2014 from 40,000 in 2020 to approximately 106,000 by 2030.488 According to findings from CHCF 's 2022 California Health Policy Survey, half of Californians (49%) reported taking at least one action to delay, skip, or cut back on care in the past 12 months because of concerns related to cost. Of those who delayed care due to cost, 47% reported that th eir health condition worsened.489 According to the same survey, more than 1 in 4 lower -income Californians (30%) reported that it was \"so mewhat\" or \"very\" difficult to find a provider who took their insurance, compared to 12% of Californians with higher in comes.489 In addition, among Californians with lower incomes, 4 in 10 reported being very worried about affording unexpected medical bills (42%), out-of-pocket costs (39%), rent or mortgage (41%) and transportation costs (40%).489 Objectives Collaborate with community partners to connect individua ls experiencing homelessness, food insecurity and other health equity barriers to community -based services Assist economic ally disadvantaged individuals through transportation and pharmaceutical assistance 485 California EDD (2022), Labor Market Information . 486 San Diego Regional Taskforce on Homelessness (2022), San Diego County WeAllCount Point -in-Time Count . 487 Serving Seniors (2021), Senior Homelessness: A Needs Assessment . 488 University of Pennsylvania (2019), The Emerging Crisis of Aged Homelessness: Could Housing Solutions Be Funded by Avoidance of Excess Shelter, Hospital , and Nursing Home Costs? 489 CHCF (2022), The 2022 CHCF California Health Policy Survey . Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 374 FY 202 2 Report of Activities In FY 202 2, SRSM C provided programs and services to help improve care coordination and access to health care for underserved or economically disadvantaged patients. Throughout the year, SRSMC provided transportation assistance to ensure that patients were able to a ttend their medical appointments. SRSMC's free shuttle service connected a variety of clinic locations and related services (e.g., imaging) along four routes. Patient services representatives helped patients schedule appointments that coincided with shuttl e rout es, enabling individuals to arrive at their doctor's office safely and on time. In FY 202 2, more than 2,450 individuals were served by SRSMC's shuttle service. The cost of prescription medication can be unaffordable for economically disadvantaged patient s, particularly those experiencing unemployment or other challenges associated with the COVID -19 pandemic. In FY 202 2, SRSMC continued to use funding from the Sharp HealthCare Foundation to provide resources to patients with medication -related financ ial bu rdens during the pandemic. The effort included SRSMC pharmacy staff from all eight locations, as well as the Clinical Pharmacy Services (CPS ) team. CPS pharmacists reviewed patient referrals and evaluated them for urgency, alternative therapies and q ualifi cation for various financial assistance programs. If alternative programs or longer -term solutions were not available, they coordinated with the SRSMC pharmacy team to provide the patient with their medications at no out -of-pocket cost. Since its inc eption in 2020, this program has covered more than $2 98,000 worth of prescription medication copays for over 680 patients. SRSMC also u sed Sharp HealthCare F oundation assistance in FY 202 2 to provide blood pressure cuffs to underserved patients with hyper tensio n. SRSMC pharmacy staff, the CPS department and the Population Health Department collaborated throughout the year to identify patients in need of regular blood pressure monitoring who would benefit from having a blood pressure cuff at home to help re port a ccurate measurements. Team members from the Population Health Department identified appropriate patients and referred them to CPS to receive an affordable blood pressure cuff through SRSMC pharmacies. Qualifying patients received these blood pressure cuffs at no cost. Since its inception in 2021, nearly 840 SRSMC patients have received assistance through this initiative. According to the W orld Health Organization , in the first year of the pandemic, global prevalence of a nxiety and depression increased by 2 5%, creating additional strain on the availability of mental health services. Recognizing that patients were experiencing delays in receiving timely behavioral health care, the Population Health Department collaborated w ith Agile Health to create a text me ssaging program to support individuals with anxiety or depression as they contemplate or wait for therapy. Launched in May and funded by the Sharp HealthCare Foundation , this program is designed to support the experience of changing moods and feelings of a nxiety . It offers inspiring and motivating techniques and helpful information on starting therapy and choosing the right Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 375 personalized treatment plan. The interactive program helps connect individuals enrolled with SRSMC care specialists or medical social w orker case managers to address their questions or concerns. In total, this program reached nearly 160 individuals in FY 2022. Beginning in FY 2019, SRSMC joined Sharp's systemwide pilot partnership with 2 -1-1's CIE to better understand and address the hea lth equity barriers that influence the health and well -being of their patients. Research continues to underscore that SDOH have a significant impact on a person's ability to access care and maintain health. SRSMC joined the CIE pilot partnership to provide more informed, holistic care to patients with challenges to health equity needs, and to connect them directly to community resources to meet those needs. Approximately 130 CIE community partners \u2014 including health car e organizations, the County of San Di ego H ealth and Human Services Agency , housing networks, food banks and other social service agencies \u2014 use an integrated technology platform to support proactive, holistic, person -centered care. Shared records enable CI E partners to evaluate an individual' s SDOH needs and utilization history of community services and to make direct referrals to critical, community -based resources. SRSMC case managers and social workers were trained on CIE to better serve vulnerable patie nts in the outpatient care setting, i ncluding those patients who experience homelessness, food insecurity and other hardships. Although delays and obstacles to CIE implementation and adoption persisted due to the COVID -19 pandemic during Year 3 of the pil ot, utilization metrics were sustaine d after demonstrating growth between Year s 1 and 2 . Community members across SDC were assisted through the CIE, including residents of Downtown, Mission Valley, Southeast San Diego, Encanto, El Cajon, Lakeside, La Mesa, Otay Mesa, National City, Chula Vista, Carlsbad, Escondido and Oceanside. The top community referrals provided through the CIE included utilities, food, housing and economic support. Sharp teams continue to work closely with 2 -1-1 on the implementation a nd data integration plans for CIE, wh ich includes evaluation of ongoing metrics, such as system utilization of CIE, referral tracking, case management efficiency, successful connection to community referrals and more.

There is no greater privilege than serving our community and Sharp Health Plan is proud to do our part as a good neighbor . \u2014 Stephen Chin, Manager of Account Management and Community Relations, Sharp Health Plan Sharp Health Plan (SHP) is located at 8520 Tech Way, Suite 200 in San Diego, ZIP code 92123. SHP is not required to develop a community benefit plan as part of Senate Bill 697 (SB 697), nor is SHP required to conduct a community health needs assessment (CH NA). However, SHP partnered with and provided support to a variety of organizations in the San Diego community during fiscal year (FY) 202 2, a selection of which are highlighted in this section. SHP services include health plans for both large and small em ployers, individual family plans and Medicare. FY 202 2 Community Benefit Program Highlights SHP provided a total of $126,677 in community benefit in FY 202 2.

Rationale The Hospital Association of San Diego and Imperial Counties ( HASD&IC ) and Sharp 2022 CHNAs identified access to health care, aging care & support, behavio ral health, children & youth well -being, chroni c health conditions, community safety, and economic stability among the priority health and social needs affecting the community members served by SHP. The HASD&IC 2022 CHNA offered recommendations for addres sing priority health needs by helping patients connect to and navigate available services to help improve their health and well -being. These recommendations fell into four categories: navigation and support, culturally appropriate care, workforce development and community collaboration. According to U SD's 2022 State of Nonprofits and Philanthropy Annual Report, there were nearly 12,500 registe red nonprofits in San Diego County ( SDC ) in 2022. Nearly three -quarters of human services and health nonprofits reported increased demand for their services, attr ibuted to inflation, influx of immigrants and refugees, and fallout from the COVID -19 (coronav irus disease 2019) pandemic. Among nonprofits who experienced an increase in demand for services, just 15% reported being able to adequately meet that demand, ind icating that there is substantial unmet need in the community.492 The same report notes that Sa n Diegans continually express high levels of confidence in nonprofits to act on the public's behalf, provide high-quality services, act ethically and promote posit ive social change. Public confidence drives engagement in the nonprofit sector.492 According to the Center for Effective Philanthropy, most U.S. nonprofit leaders report that their foundations are working diff erently now compared to early 2020 , by streamlining processes to reduce the burden on grantees and providing more unrestricted support. Additionally, many are modifying their practices due to rising consideration of racial equity. However, nearly half of l eaders say that their boards are the biggest barrier to their fo undation's ability to advance racial equity.493 In a report titled Causes Count , the California Association of Nonprofits explains that California's nonprofits bring in more than $40 billion each year from out -of-state sources and are responsible for 1 i n every 14 California jobs. Statewide, nonprofits employ over 1.2 million people, accounting for 7% of all California employment.494 According to the American Hospital Association's Center for He alth Innovation, health care providers, public health agencies and community -based organizations need to effectively coordinate their efforts together to create meaningful movement 492 University of San Diego (2022). 2022 State of Nonprofits and Philanthropy Annual Report : State of Nonprofits in San Diego . 493 The Center for Effective Philanthropy (2022), In Their Own Words: Funders Share Stories of Change.

Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 380 toward healthy communities. Each partner should have defined roles and responsibilities within the collaborative, to help address power i mbalances with decision -making processes as well as help each partner focus on their strengths to best contribute to the effort.495 According to the National Council of Nonprofits, nonprofits are perfectly positioned to maximize public benefits with their deep knowledge of community needs, reach, and existing relationships, particularly in low -income and underserved or hard -to-reach populations. Nonprofits provide vital services and are a key part of the economy, employing more than 12.5 million peopl e before the COVID -19 pandemic. However, resources declined for nonprofits, resulting in the loss of more than 1.6 million jobs during the first three months of the pandemic. For communities and local economies to recover, governments need to invest in the work of nonprofits.496 Approximately 8% of the population will develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD ) during their lifetime; however, these figures are higher among veterans and active -duty serv ice members. Each year, approximately 11% to 20% of ve terans of Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom and 12% of Gulf War veterans have PTSD , while it is estimated that 30% of Vietnam veterans have had PTSD in their lifetime.497 Integrative medicine can help people with behavioral health conditions, cancer, persistent pain, chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia and many other conditions to better manage their symptoms and improve their quality of life by reducing fatigue, pain and anxiety. Examples of common practices include acu puncture, animal -assisted therapy, aromatherapy, dietary supplements, hydrotherapy, massage therapy, music therapy and meditation .498,499 Among SDC's 3. 3 million residents, over a million people face nutrition insecurity and are unable to provide three nutr itious meals a day for themselves or their households.500 While nutrition insecurity has declined since 2021, high rates remain due to long - standing economic disparities that were exacerbated by the COVID -19 pandemic . As of March 2022 , more than 1 in 4 San Diegans experienced nutrition insecurity, with disproportionate impacts noted among communities of color .501 Objectives Participate in community -sponsored events Support nonprofit community organizations that address identified communi ty nee ds through financial donations, board service and other contributions 495 American Hospital Association Center for Health Innovation (2022), The Partnership for Public Health . 496 National Council of Nonprofits (2022), Strengthening State and Local Economies in Partnerships with Nonprofits: Principles, Recommendations, and Models for Investing Co ronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds . 497 U.S. Department of Veterans A ffairs (2022), How Common is PTSD in Veterans? 498 Mayo Clinic (2022), Integrative Medicine and Health . 499 Cleveland Clinic (2022), Hydrotherapy . 500 San Diego Food Bank (2022), Hunger Fact Sheet 202 2. 501 San Diego Hunger Coalition (2022), March 2022 Data Release: Nutriti on Insec urity Remains Above Pre -pandemic Levels and Impacts Communities of Color Most. Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 381 FY 202 2 Report of Activities SHP supports San Diego's community organizations through a variety of activities, including participation in and coordination of community -sponsore d events , service on community boards and committees , and financial support and fundraising for health and social causes.

SHP supported students at Vista Magnet Middle School by providing over 300 reusable grocery bags to students and their families in need at no cost. In October, SHP's chief medical officer presented information about COVID -19, including virus details and the importance of vaccines, to approximately 100 employees at the San Diego Zoo. In addition, SHP collaborated with SGH to offer flu and COVID -19 vaccines to more than 300 San Diego Zoo and San Diego Safari Park staff in January. In September, SHP provided a resource table with information about its services and resources at the City of San Diego's 2022 Employee Appreciation Event at Crown Point Park. More than 1 in 4 (28%) San Diegans experience nutrition insec urity, and to address this ongoing need, the San Diego hunger relief sector provides food assistance equal to over 33 million meals each month. In FY 2022, SHP continued to financially support organizations that assist San Diegans experiencing food insecur ity, including the Food Bank. In April, SHP s ponsored the Food Bank's annual Chefs, Cork & Craft Gala, which featured live musical entertainment, silent and live auctions, hors d'oeuvres and a chef - prepared dinner for guests to enjoy outdoors. SHP also pro vided a year -end donation to Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 382 support the Food Bank's hunger -relief response programs. In addition, SHP continued its financial support of the San Diego Food System Alliance, a diverse and inclusive network of leaders in SDC committed to building a food sys tem that works for everyone. To go beyond the need for temporary assistance, the Food System Alliance established a San Diego County Food Vision 2030 \u2014 a shared vision, plan, and movement to transform SDC's food system over the next 10 years toward a more equitable and resilient future, changing the way food is grown, moved, shared and perceived . SHP sponsored the organization's Annual Gathering for San Diego County Food Vision 2030 in September. Held at the California Center for the Arts in Escondido, the event featured inspirational speakers, intera ctive sessions, open space for dialogue, networking and local food options. UPAC provides health and human services to improve the well -being of underserved diverse populations through its 15 SDC locations. In FY 2022, UPAC reached over 34,000 individuals , providing direct services to more than 8,400 underserved community members. SHP has been a proud supporter of UPAC for several years. In May, SHP sponsored UPAC's first annual Taste of Culture event, designed to bridge cross -cultural understanding, conne ct partners and friends with its mission and raise funds for vital programs and services, while offering a unique tasting experience from different cultures in the City Heights neighborhood. The event also highl ighted the continued success of UPAC's Neighb orhood Enterprise Center, which provides the City Heights community with impactful programs to nurture innovation, build neighborhood self - sufficiency and celebrate diversity. The center hires from within the co mmunity, and includes an affordable caf\u00e9, tec hnology center, print shop and a safe gathering space for community members, as well as serves as an emergency food distribution site and community resource center. In addition, the center's staff trains and men tors local youth. SHP continued to collabora te with The Nonprofit Institute at USD, which recently celebrated its 20 th anniversary and provides training, education and research to support and strengthen the nonprofit sector and philanthropy throughout the San Diego region. In FY 2022, SHP continued to serve as a member of the advisory board, providing guidance for strategic direction and community impact, as well as programming, marketing, and fundraising efforts. SHP contributed financially to the organiz ation's Nonprofit Governance Symposium, an an nual event that gathers nonprofit leaders who envision the future of governance and share best practices to build stronger organizations and communities. At the event, SHP assisted in selecting two annual award winners, including ABASD, who are recognized for and promote excellence in governance in SDC's nonprofit sector . Representing the interests of more than 30,000 Asian -owned businesses countywide, ABASD is dedicated to building sustainable communities by pr oviding educational workshops, technical assi stance, business mentorship, and access to capital to minority -owned small and disadvantaged businesses, entrepreneurs and start -up organizations. ABASD is one of the region's largest ethnic business association s, a County of San Diego Live Well Partner an d is part of America's Small Business Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 383 Development Center network, which provides low to no -cost advising and consulting services to entrepreneurs and small businesses. ABASD partners with the County of San Diego Black Chamber of Commerce and San Diego Coun ty Hispanic Chamber of Commerce through the Strategic Alliance San Diego Ethnic Chambers of Commerce, which represents the interests of tens of thousands of local businesses in SDC.

Healing Wave Aquatics provides aquatic bodywork therapies for military veterans, active -duty personnel, and caregivers living with the debilitating impacts of post- traumatic stress. In FY 2022, Healing Wave Aquatics opened its new facility in San Diego, which is the first of its kind in the nation, to provide a therapeutic warm -water program. Patients receive eight one -on-one sessions of warm -water aquatic ther apy with a skilled aquatic practitioner, which includes light stretching, massage and movement, offering a state of relaxation and a calm space. The organization is a unique therapeutic resource for San Diego's military community and for others who may ben efit from its services. In FY 2022, SHP support ed Healing Wave Aquatics' goal of establishing its own facility by donating to its capital campaign. In addition, since 2019, SHP has been a part of Sharp's systemwide pilot partnership with 2 -1-1 San Diego's (2-1-1) CIE to better understand and address the health equity barriers that influence the health and well -being of their patients. Research continues to underscore that social determinants of health (SDOH ) have a significant impact on a person's ability to access care and maintain health. SHP joined the CIE pilot partnership in order to provide more informed, holistic care to patients with challenges to health equity, and to connect them directly to community resources to meet those needs. Approximately 130 CIE community partners \u2014 including health care organizations, the County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency, housing networks, food banks and other social service agencies \u2014 use an integrated technology platform to support proactive, holisti c, person -centered care. Shared records enable CIE partners to evaluate an individual's SDOH needs and utilization history of community services and to make direct referrals to critical, community -based resources. SHP team members were trained on CIE to be tter serve patients in the acute care setting, including patients who experience homelessness, food insecurity and other hardships. Although delays and obstacles to CIE implementation and adoption persisted due to the COVID -19 pandemic during Year 3 of th e CIE pilot, utilization metrics were sustained after demonstrating growth between Years 1 and 2. Community members across SDC Sharp HealthCare Community Ben efit Plan and Report Page 384 were assisted through the CIE , including residents of Downtown San Diego, Mission Valley, Southeast San Diego, Encanto, El Cajon, Lakeside, La Mesa, Otay Mesa, National City, Chula Vista, Carlsbad, Escondido and Oceanside. The top community referrals provided to patients through the CIE included utilities, food, housing and economic support. Sharp teams continue to work closely wi th 2-1-1 on the implementation and data integration plans for CIE, which includes evaluation of ongoing metrics, such as system utilization of CIE, referral tracking, case management efficiency, successful connection to community referrals and more. Data w ill be used to re -evaluate the value and sustainability of CIE for Sharp upon completion of the pilot's fourth year. FY 2023 Plan SHP will do the following: Provide health information and education at community -sponsored events to address identified healt h needs for San Diegans Provide coordination, financial support and fundraising activities for local nonprofit organizations \u2014 particularly organizations that support vulnerable communities throughout SDC Serve on various community boards that support th e health and well -being of the community Participate in 2 -1-1's CIE program to connect members who experience health equity barriers to critical community services Appendices Appendix A Sharp HealthCare Involvement in Community Organizations Community boards, committees and civic organizations where Sharp HealthCare executive leadership and staff participated on the organization's behalf.
