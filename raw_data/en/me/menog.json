The Natio nal Genomic Test Directory is set out in a separate excel document available at the following location: https://www.england.nhs.uk/publication/national -genomic -test-directories/ This eligibility criteria document supplements the National Genomic Test Directory by setting out which patients should be considered for testing under that indication, and the requesting specialties is a list of the clinical specialties who would be expected to request the test. To develop the National Genomic Test Directory and testing criteria, NHS England convened an expert panel for rare disease. The panels brought together clinicians, scientists, health economists, policy experts, public representatives and patient organisations. The panel developed a methodology to reflect the changing technology and consider the optimal testing for a clinical condition, rather than a specific gene , to ensure the NHS is receiving the best value from genomic tests across all clinical indications. The NHS standard contract stipulates that only tests in the National Genomic Test Directory are commissioned and paid for by the NHS and that they must be delivered by a Genomic Laboratory Hub (or their sub -contractors), to the standards set in the service specification. As part of the future delivery model, each Trust will be mapped to a single Genomic Laboratory Hub for the provision of testing. During 20 20/2021 the Genomic Laboratory Hubs will continue to mobilise the new service, including establishing the capability and capacity to deliver the genomic testing identified in the National Genomic Test Directory. Where testing was not previously available, providers should liaise with their local Genomic Laboratory Hub to confirm the date from which they will be able to requisition new tests. If you have any questions about the genomic testing available in your area, please contact your local Genomic Laboratory Hub. More information about the Genomic Labo ratory Hubs can be found here: https://www.england.nhs.uk/genomics/genomic -laboratory -hubs/ 3 Date October 2021 v2 Document overview Clinical Indications The following elements are presented for each clinical indication: Clinical Indication Name : name of the clinical indication, preceded by unique clinical indication code. Testing Criteria : description of the patients who should receive the test. Where a clinical indicat ion has multiple individual test items and testing is expected to be performed in a specific order, this is specified. Details of commonly overlapping clinical indications are also provided. Overlapping Indications : pointers to other clinical indications with overlapping presentations or genomic targets. Where in Pathway : guidance as to where the genetic test should usually sit in the patient pathway, particularly with respect to other diagnostic investigations Requesting Specialties : specialties that will be routinely permitted to request the test Requesting specialties have been nationally agreed as appropriate specialties for referrals for testing. The list of requesting specialties is not designed to operate at a very specific level or to limit test requests to just those clinical specialities listed, as pathways will differ across the country, e.g. a specialist with the job title 'paediatric craniofacial surgeon' would potentially be grouped within 'Surgery' or 'Paediatrics'. If GLHs receive test reque sts from clinicians whose role doesn't fall neatly within a single requesting specialty, or whose clinical specialty is not listed for that clinical indication, the GLH can process that test if it is appropriate as per their agreed local pathways and the e ligibility criteria for the clinical indication is being met . Specialist Service Group : specialist service group that covers the clinical indication. The options are: Screening Associated Tests The associated tests contain information about the tests which routinely constitute the target for the clinical indication . It is expected that all tests listed under a particular clinical indication will be routinely performed, unless there is clear clinical rationale not to do so. Where a test has no t been undertaken this must be clearly communicated to the requesting clinician. Information provided includes : Optimal Family Structure : optimal family structure for testing if relevant relatives are available. The options are: Singleton; Trio; Singleton or Trio; Parents only; and Other 4 Date October 2021 v2 Scope : the type of variation to be detected. The options are: Small variant detection; Copy number variant detection to genomewide resolution; Copy number variant detection to exon level resolution; Short tan dem repeat analysis; defect detection; and Other Target Type : the type of target at which the variants need to be detected. The options are: Genomewide; Panel of genes or loci; Single gene(s); and Single interval 5 Date October 2021 v2 Target Name : names of the gene(s), interval(s) or panels at which the variant type should be detected Test Method : test method to be used. The options are: WGS; WES; Large panel; Medium England has sought feedback regarding the wording of the following components of the testing criteria and scope: 'Testing Criteria' including the 'Key Locus' components of the Sco pe' section This document incorporates the feedback received; subsequent changes to the Test Directory are managed through NHS England's evaluation process. Test Ordering Clinicians wishing to request genomic tests can do so by; Requesting the clinical indication ( name and unique code of the clinical indication) , in instances where the clinical indication to be tested is known If the clinician is aware that some of the constituent tests which are offered as part of the clinical indication are not needed, they can specify to the lab which constituent tests are required and which aren't Clinicians should follow local process to request genomic tests. All referrals for tes ting will be triaged by the local Genomic Laboratory Hub to ensure the most appropriate test is performed. In instances where test ing is requested by the clinical indication, the Genomic Laboratory Hub will review the test request and relevant clinical inf ormation and select the most appropriate constituent test(s) to facilitate the test request. Testing should be targeted at those where a genetic or genomic diagnosis will guide management for the proband or family. 6 Date October 2021 v2 Content Part I.

In most autosomal recessive conditions, cascade testing of wider family members and unrelated partners is NOT indicated. Clinicians wishing to request a test under this indication should check with their GLH whether the test is feasible prior to offering t esting to patients. Testing is not usually indicated in this context because the test results have a minimal impact on the risk of health problems in pregnancies beyond the parents and siblings of the affected individual: 1. For most genes, interpreting the results of population risk carrier testing is complex, and the proportion of detected variants which can be confidently used for reproductive purposes is low 2. Carrier testing at population risk is not able to rule out an unrelated partner being a ca rrier of the condition, only reduce the likelihood 3. The carrier frequency of most autosomal recessive conditions is low, such that the marginal gain from genetic testing of an unrelated partner has limited impact on the prenatal decision -making process However, there are circumstances in which the chance of a baby being affected is more substantial, and carrier testing is possible. Testing is mo re likely to be considered appropriate where the following criteria are met: 1. Presence of a homozygous or compound heterozygous genotype in a baby would have a sufficiently predictable effect to permit reproductive choices to be made; for example, carrier testing for haemochromatosis or alpha -1-antitrypsin deficiency is NOT appropri ate as it is not possible to predict from the genotype whether an affected baby will ever develop medical problems 2. The associated gene is well -understood and does not contain a high level of novel, benign variation, such that it is likely to be possible t o interpret variants found on full gene testing in individuals at population risk; in this context only likely pathogenic or pathogenic variants according to the ACGS / ACMG classification will be reported PLUS one of the following: 1. The carrier frequency o f the condition is higher than 1 in 70 (in the relevant population(s) for the patient to be tested) 2. The couple are consanguineous (second cousins or closer); where this is the only criterion that is met, testing will be limited to the known familial varian t. In exceptional circumstances and after discussion with the home GLH, testing may be considered appropriate in situations where the gene is suitable for testing and there are known pathogenic variant(s), that can be tested for, that account for the maj ority of cases in the relevant population(s) for the patient to be tested; in this context, the test will primarily target the pathogenic variants that account for the majority of cases in the relevant population(s). NOTE: The following specific clinical i ndications should be used instead for the relevant disorders: R181 Congenital adrenal hyperplasia carrier testing R361 Haemoglobinopathy trait or carrier testing R362 Carrier testing for sickle cell disease R252 SMA carrier testing at populatio n risk for partners of known carriers R105 MCADD - Medium -chain Date October 2021 v2 Table 1. Example autosomal recessive conditions with a carrier frequency higher than 1 in 70 in these example populations, which would be covered by this clinical indication.
