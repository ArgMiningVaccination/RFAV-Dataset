The conference featured nine highly accomplished speakers and panelists discussing academic career options and providing advice for graduate students, postdocs, and biomedical engineers and scientists. Attendees learned how to best position themselves for success in obtaining jobs in academic institutions, how to overcome obstacles and challenges, and gain important lab management skills. The event included breakout and panel sessions with options to learn about career building skills, negotiation tactics for faculty positions, or transitioning into academic careers from different job sectors. Following the sessions, a networking reception offered the opportunity for attendees to learn more about academic career choices by interacting with panelists in an informal setting.
