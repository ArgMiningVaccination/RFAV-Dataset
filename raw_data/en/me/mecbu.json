Some are volunteers; others are paid for their efforts. But all exemplify the University's mission to provide education, research and service both at home and abroad. As you read about the contributions these men and women have made to their communities, please keep in mind that your work, too, reflects on UAlbany - and that we are also very proud of all you do. - University at Albany Interim President George M.

Zimpher Chancellor School of Business Site Is Dedicated Faculty, students and staff gathered last fall near the Grand Entry Plaza on the uptown campus to dedicate the site of UAlbany's new School of Business building. Plans call for construction of a technologically advanced facility that will enhance academic and student programs, and promote the school as the premier business school in the Northeast. The architectural firm Perkins+Will has been selected to design the building. An effort to raise private support for construction has already realized $2.7 million. The State University of New York Board of Trustees has appointed Nancy L. Zimpher SUNY's 12th chancellor, effective June 1. Zimpher, the first woman to hold that posi - tion, joins SUNY from the University of Cincinnati, where she has served as president since October 2003. During her tenure, UC increased enrollment; finalized a 15-year, $1.7 billion capital effort; and launched a $1 billion fundraising campaign. Zimpher succeeds former Chancellor and U.S. Navy Vice Admiral John R. Ryan, who left in May 2007 to become president of the Center for Creative Leadership in Greensboro, N.C. Ryan served as interim president at the University at Albany from 2004 to 2005. SSW Works to Improve Services to Children UAlbany's School of Social Welfare is working to address recruiting shortfalls and high turnover in the child-welfare system workforce. Dean Katharine Briar-Lawson and Social Work Education Consortium Director Mary McCarthy head the National Child Welfare Workforce Institute (NCWWI), established with a $16.5 million U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Children's Bureau grant. The initiative, which will support leadership development in public, private and tribal child-welfare sys - tems, partners UAlbany with the universities of Denver, Iowa, Michigan State, Michigan, North Carolina and Southern Maine; Fordham University; and the National Indian Child Welfare Association. Through the New York State Child Welfare Workforce Initiative (CWWI), Associate Professor Nancy Claiborne and Assistant Research Professor Catherine Lawrence are seeking to improve safety, permanency and well-being out - comes for youngsters and families by exploring workforce needs in voluntary agencies that contract with the child- welfare system. Claiborne and Lawrence have received a $2.5 million Children's Bureau grant to support the five-year project. Mark Schmidt Joe Putrock SPRING 2009 3Fulbright Scholars Travel to China, Namibia Fulbright Program support made it possible for two UAlbany scholars to travel overseas for study and research this spring. Associate Professor David Yun Dai of the Department of Educational and Counseling Psychology was in China through March to conduct teacher surveys on inquiry-based learning in that country, in conjunction with its educational reform efforts. Dai, who joined the University faculty in 2001, teaches courses related to instruction, learning, motivation and cognition. David Jones, a doctoral student in the Department of History, is interviewing citizens who participated in Namibia's liberation struggle, which culminated with its independence from South African rule in 1990. During his 10 months there, Jones is receiving some basic instruction in Oshiwambo, several closely related languages spoken by the majority of Namibians. Straussman Is NAPA Fellow Jeffrey Straussman, dean of UAlbany's Rockefeller College of Public Affairs and Policy since 2006, has been elected a Fellow of the National Academy of Public Administration (NAPA). Cited by NAPA for his sustained and outstanding contribution to the field of public administration through public service and scholarship, Straussman is internationally recognized as a researcher, teacher, writer and consultant in such fields as public management, government budgeting and finance, and political economy. New Program in Law Is Announced Beginning next fall, students will simultaneously be able to pursue law and graduate-level business degrees, thanks to a new program announced by UAlbany's School of Business and Albany Law School. The J.D./M.B.A. program, which allows for completion of coursework within four years, rather than the more traditional five, will prepare students for careers in commercial and investment banking, government regulation, business policy analysis and management consulting.

Supported by a $1 million grant from the National Science Foundation, the Center for Achievement, Retention and Student Success, or CARSS, was designed to \"curb defec - tions to non-STEM fields of our science and math majors,\" said center director and Associate Professor of Organic Chemistry Rabi Musah. She worked with colleagues and co-principle investigators Hua Shi and Denise McKeon of the Department of Biological Sciences to establish the center, which will offer tutoring, mentoring and career counseling services for STEM majors, as well as financial incentives. CARSS builds upon three successful UAlbany programs: Collegiate Science Technology Entry Program (C-STEP), Project Excel and Science Research in the High School. A Bright Idea Promotes Energy $aving$ If energy costs are putting the squeeze on you, just follow UAlbany's example: reduce building temperatures to 65 degrees; set lighting to lower levels, if possible; and switch off appliances and other electrical equipment not in use. During the intersession - Dec. 20, 2008, through Jan. 15, 2009 - the University saved more than $266,000 by employing those simple measures. That reduction, which exceeded the original goal of $250,000, represented a 19-percent decrease in utility costs from the same period a year earlier. The third annual Fall Energy Campaign, which promoted the conservation of energy use in campus resi - dence halls and apartments from Sept. 3 through Nov. 9, realized another $14,000 in savings. Announcement of the savings was made at a February lecture featuring environmental activist Denis Hayes, who coordinated the first Earth Day 39 years ago. National Grid, the lecture's co-sponsor, also donated $5,000 to UAlbany's Change-A-Light Campaign, launched last fall by the University's Office of Environmental Sustainability to encourage replacement of incandescent lightbulbs with compact fluorescent bulbs.Alumna Donates Sculpture The sculpture Nike II , by Maria Hall, B.A.'74, M.A.'79, has been installed in the plaza fronting the Life Sciences Research Building on UAlbany's uptown campus. The stainless steel sculpture, named for the Greek goddess of strength, speed and victory, is a dynamic play of strong, simple forms in space. Hall, who generously donated the work to The University Fine Art Collections, has exhibited in more than 40 group and eight one-person exhibitions at such venues as Skidmore College; the Empire State Plaza; Munson-Williams-Proctor School of Art Gallery in Utica, N.Y.; and Adelphi University, Garden City, N.Y .

The Massrys' donation is the first major gift to the Richard Bailey Memorial Fund , which will be established with the proceeds of the Class of 2009 gift. UAlbany seniors are focusing their fundraising effort on the scholarship as a tribute to their late classmate. Bailey, a 22-year-old sociology major and criminal justice minor from Wantagh, N.Y., passed away in October following a shooting in downtown Albany. His parents, James and Lisa Bailey, and his sister Katie traveled to campus in December to receive his undergraduate degree at winter commencement. Mark Schmidt Michael J Ficeto/Hearst Magazines Last December, at the height of the holiday season, alumni at Deloitte and the Deloitte Foundation gave UAlbany's School of Business another reason to celebrate: a $525,000 commitment earmarked for school, faculty research and student support. The funding will establish the Deloitte Foundation Endowment and the Accounting Chair Deloitte Foundation Opportunity Fund . Faculty research will be funded through the endowment, as will setup and maintenance of state-of-the-art teaching facili - ties at the new School of Business building. Through the Opportunity Fund , the Department of Accounting chair will be able to support faculty research, student participation in symposiums and competitions, and other enhancements to the academic experience. To date, the commitment is the largest private gift desig - nated for support of the new school, which will feature technologically advanced classrooms and meeting spaces; space for student and career services; student reception areas; and additional workspace for graduate students. Completion of the building is anticipated by 2013. you could give to one single organization devoted to strengthening our communities, cultivating the arts, promoting child welfare, and educating the leaders of tomorrow?

The fund will benefit teachers who are enrolled in the school's graduate program, and who provide direct services to students in the Albany, Schenectady, Troy and Cohoes school districts. Hillside House Contribution Will Benefit Graduate Students A scholarship fund established by one of New York's first community-based residence programs for the developmentally disabled honors the program founder's commitment to education. Hillside House of Coeymans, N.Y., donated $250,000 to endow The Dr. Frank J. Filippone '41, '48 - Hillside House Scholarship . Filippone, who earned bachelor's and master's degrees in education, served in New York school districts as a teacher and administrator prior to founding Hillside House in 1975. For his contributions to the field of education, the University recognized him as a distinguished alumnus in 1994. Filippone passed away in 2002. The scholarship fund will assist graduate students enrolled in the School of Education, the College of Arts and Sciences' Department of Psychology, or the School of Social Welfare. Recipients must demonstrate academic achievement, financial need, and an interest in helping people who are developmentally disabled. Museum Exhibition Program Receives Grant from Warhol Foundation A two-year, $60,000 grant from The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts will support the University Art Museum's exhibition program. In announcing the grant, Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs Susan D. Phillips, congratulated Museum Director Janet Riker and her colleagues.

By the 20th century, reunion was fixed at the end of the school year, and coincided with both Senior Week and Commencement. The festivities often included skits performed by both students and graduates. The photo to the right, for instance, shows the Class of 1911, at its fifth reunion in 1916, performing a skit as Henry Ford's Peace Ship. With the move to the uptown campus in 1966, the graduating classes became too large to hold an Alumni Reunion at the same time Commencement was scheduled, and reunion was moved back to June. In this installment of \"Ask Geoff,\" I thought it might be nice to look back - and ahead - at some favorite UAlbany traditions, such as Alumni Reunion/Homecoming. These musicians, pictured in the 1955 Pedagogue, provided some of the entertainment at Homecoming 1954.Photo gift of Ester Woodward '11,Alumni Memorabilia Collection SPRING 2009 9 The first Homecoming was held a little over 100 years after the first Alumni Reunion. Homecoming began very informally, on Oct. 31, 1953, when the Class of 1954 seniors invited graduates of the classes of 1951-53 to return to campus for a soccer game, punch party and dance. Unfortunately, no photos of that event have been found. (If you have one, I'd appreciate your sharing it with me.) In 1953, soccer was in its first season as an intercolle - giate sport, and it would be the big fall sport until the introduction of football in 1970. By 1954, Homecoming had also acquired musical accompaniment, as you can see from the photo at the bottom of the opposite page. Within the next few years, Homecoming would feature parades, floats (at right, note the award-winning 1958 Beta Zeta Sputnik-era float from the 1959 Pedagogue ), and Campus Queen contests. The Campus Queen contests disappeared in the 1970s, and Homecoming activities centered on the University's new football team. Alumni Reunion continued in June, with the unfortunate effect that it became disconnected from any contact with current students. But, after the reunion in June 2007, the decision was made to combine Homecoming and Alumni Reunion during Homecoming Weekend each fall. That back-to-the-future move revived the old tradition of holding Alumni Reunions when students were on campus so that graduates from five, 10, 15, 20 and 25 years prior could enjoy special Homecoming/Reunion events that would include future alumni, as well.

By Carol Olechowski As a professional basketball player in Europe, former Great Dane and UAlbany \"cover guy\" Jamar Wilson, B.A.'06 , is very well. After graduation, he signed with Belgacom Liege, a Belgian team that, halfway through the 2008-09 season, was \"unde - feated in the European Cup.\" Wilson likes Belgium: \"The food is great, the weather isn't too much different from New York, and I am getting a chance to experience another culture.\" He lives in the French-speaking part of the country, \"so I have been pushing myself to learn as much French as possible. French 101 and 102 from freshman year is coming in handy.\" When he isn't practic - ing his language skills, Wilson enjoys his time on the court. He and his teammates play not only in Belgium, but all over Europe, \"including the Netherlands, Germany, Spain, Poland, France and Latvia.\" We recently caught up with Professor Emerita Sophia Lubensky , who retired in 2007. The former Department of Languages, Literatures and Cultures (LLC) faculty member - \"being one of those for whom the wide, wide world is divided into Manhattan and the rest\" - now resides in New York City, \"within walking distance of Lincoln Center and Carnegie Hall.\" For the past three years, Lubensky has remained close to home, but this spring, she plans a trip to Russia. Editor's Note: Beginning with this issue of UAlbany, you can catch up with friends, former classmates, and active and retired faculty in \"Where Are They Now?\" Brian Lillis, B.S.'08 , Wilson's former teammate, now lives in Chicago. A financial analyst at Allstate Insurance Company's home office, he runs the financial forecasting/planning and weekly and monthly reporting for the firm's Marketing Technology Organization; \"I analyze all the numbers around the organization and make recommendations.\" Since joining Allstate, Lillis has found his UAlbany business degree \"very beneficial. I am able to directly relate many of the proj- ects I completed at the University to real-life examples. My classes provided me the education I needed to get into and live in the business world.\" Lillis still enjoys playing basketball; he's joined \"a couple of leagues with friends in Chicago.\" He feels at home there: \"I'm glad I got used to the cold weather in Albany, because it's just as cold here.\" Mark McCarty Helping Han ds They're medical professionals, experts on autism and schoolteachers. They're volunteers, giving their time and talent to aid their neighbors - children, the elderly, the poor and others in need - through service to community agencies and civic organizations. They're University at Albany alumni, students and faculty, and they gladly lend a hand whenever and wherever it's needed. In this issue of UAlbany , we're proud to profile a few of these thousands of dedicated women and men who help to make life better for others, both at home and abroad. In future editions, we'll continue to highlight the contributions of graduates, students and faculty members who - through their exemplary service to others - connect the University with the wider world.UALBANY MAGAZINE 14 For nearly 40 years, UAlbany students have been helping others through the Community and Public Service Program (CPSP), a School of Social Welfare pro - gram open to all students and majors across campus. Now, the program, which began in 1970 as the Community Service Project, is expanding and embracing another progressive initiative: service learning. \"We're trying to make service learning more prevalent here,\" said CPSP Director Loretta Pyles, author of the book Progressive Community Organizing: A Critical Approach for a Globalizing World (2009, Routledge). Through a survey con - ducted with community partners, CPSP is brokering community needs in relation to faculty strengths. \"We're encouraging faculty to incorporate it into their courses by helping them find agencies, getting them to think about community needs, and exploring how these opportunities might fit into their own research and teaching interests.\" Pyles was hired by the School of Social Welfare in July 2008 to bring more aca - demic rigor to student service endeavors and enhance CPSP's ability to support faculty service-learning activities across disciplines. A request for proposals (RFP) focused on community-based research and service learning opportunities for Honors Program faculty; partnerships with the Institute for Teaching, Learning and Academic Leadership (ITLAL) and the Office of Undergraduate Education; and collaborations with the Capital Region Network of Universities and New York Campus Compact will aid Pyles in \"taking CPSP to new heights.\" Annually, CPSP participants donate more than 40,000 hours to organizations on and off campus. In return for volunteering 60 to 100 hours a semester and writing a paper about the experience, each student receives academic credit; a maximum of three CPSP courses may be taken for credit. The opportunities available through the program also \"help students choose majors, build their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and choose careers,\" Pyles noted. Kelly Morrone, manager of Volunteer Services at Albany Medical Center, enjoys working with CPSP participants. \"We have students who might start out doing [volunteer work] for credit, and they may do all of it with us. Then, when they're done with credit classes, a few will still stay with us.\" The Albany Police Athletic League (PAL) offers homework assistance, nutritious snacks, and extracurricular activities at 17 sites throughout the city. But \"we would - n't be able to offer the number of activi - ties that we provide without student par - ticipation. We're a not for profit,\" said director Leonard Ricchiuti. He also prais - es UAlbany students for being positive role models to the youngsters who partic - ipate in PAL, one of about 300 communi - ty organizations that benefit from CPSP. School of Social Welfare Ph.D. student Sherri Stevens, M.S.W.'07, has worked in the CPSP office for two years and assists students in selecting volunteer assign - ments. \"Some know exactly where they want to go\"; for others, \"we get a feel for the kind of environment they're comfort - able in, and we guide them to agencies. Some students want to be on campus, which is equally important. Student labor helps some of the organizations run.\" For his first CPSP course, African Student Association President Nana Y. Banful photographed activities sponsored by his organization. This semester, he is student coordinator for the Campus Leaders Round Table, a group that dis - cusses UAlbany's role in community change, forges new alliances and creates action plans for community engagement. \"I believe in serving the community,\" said Banful, a political science major set to graduate in 2010. As a volunteer with Seal a Smile, a Healthy Capital District Initiative (HCDI) free dental-care program, senior and campus Pre-Dental Club President Mariam Sharifipour connects with local elementary-school students. The California native has also expanded CPSP's outreach beyond the Capital Region: She received credit for a recent trip she arranged on her own, to provide free dental care to residents of a village in Mexico. \"It was such an amazing, rewarding experience,\" remembered Sharifipour, a biology major and dental hygienist who plans to be a dentist. \"We worked 10-hour days, and there were still lines wrapped around the building. On our last day there, [the villagers] were so grateful for our services that they had a big feast for us.\" For more information about CPSP, please visit www.albany.edu/cpsp.

Tyrone G. Bristol, M.D., F.A.A.P., M.P.H.'07 Chos en by His Prof es sion By Carol Olechowski UALBANY MAGAZINE 16 SPRING 2009 17 Tyrone G. Bristol didn't choose his career. \"Pediatrics chose me,\" he maintains. His profession, the Guyana native notes, represents his \"best opportunity to impact on the health of those in the earliest stage of the life cycle. It affords great rapport with children and adolescents, and with parents and caregivers to protect the health of their children.\" Bristol immigrated to the United States at age 14, settling with his family in Brooklyn, N.Y. After earning a B.A. in biology at Cornell and an M.D. at Albany Medical College, he completed post-graduate training at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. He subsequently enrolled at UAlbany's School of Public Health to earn an M.P.H. with a concentration in health policy and man - agement; \"I knew public health was an integral part of how I wanted to practice medicine.\" Bristol attended classes part time while treating patients at Albany Medical Center and at Whitney M. Young Jr. Health Center. Until 2008, he continued his affiliation with the medical center and taught at Albany Medical College, rising to the rank of associate professor of pediatrics. Last December, Bristol began a new assignment: chief medical officer at Shanghai United Family Hospitals and Clinics. \"I was ready to explore other opportunities in healthcare, including international health; I also wanted to use my M.P.H. in a larger administrative role.\" The position offered other benefits, too. \"The opportunity to experience a new culture is very exciting. And with China's commitment to enhancing its healthcare services, it's an ideal time for me to be here and contribute as much as I can.\" Bristol has a four-year contract, \"but I hope to be here longer. It takes a long time to see your impact on healthcare.\" His clinical interests include child and adolescent over - weight and obesity, and childhood lead poisoning. In his new position, \"I'd like to develop our hospital's adoles - cent medicine program and see what opportunities exist for expanding care to China's teens, as well. As in most places, everyone understands that babies need care, but sometimes we forget about the teens and their healthcare needs. There is also a growing obesity problem in China, so I will be exploring that. I think one of the biggest areas to impact is preventative healthcare. As in many other areas of the world, people focus on acute illnesses, but the challenge is helping them embrace preventative care with regular checkups, immunizations, screenings, and so on.\" Bristol is grateful to his \"amazing\" teachers, colleagues, students and families \"for their guidance and support\" over the years. With regard to his M.P.H., he adds, \"It's wonderful to be using all the skills I learned at the School of Public Health in this opportunity as a leader in an international healthcare organization.\" He anticipates that some of his greatest challenges will stem from \"learning how to deliver care to patients from all over the world; work with an international staff with different languages, cultures and beliefs; and adjust to the realities of practicing healthcare in a country with differ - ent standards than I am accustomed to.\" But he welcomes those challenges. \"It is an opportunity for me to learn and also to be creative in delivering healthcare while try - ing to enhance standards, if I can.\" Opposite page: Pediatrician Tyrone G.

A member of the UAlbany psychology department faculty, she became CARD director in 2002. Under her leadership, CARD has evolved \"from primarily research to training, education and consultation. We're very actively involved with the community,\" says Christodulu, who also works with 10 full- and part-time employees, eight under - graduates and five graduate students to coordinate programs for \"a statewide network\" of centers affiliated with other uni - versities. \"We use only evidence-based approaches. Often, peo - ple in the autism field are selling hope and hype. We are unique because we know that what we offer works.\" Workshops, seminars, training, and local and statewide confer - ences are tailored for parents and teachers. In the schools, basic awareness training involves everyone, including special educa - tors, bus drivers and librarians. The more advanced \"train the trainer\" approach focuses on \"helping teachers, administrators and other professionals to better meet the education - al needs of students with autism. We target areas like improving behavior, instruction and social development,\" notes Christodulu. For families, \"we have educational seminars. We're having one this spring on social develop - ment; parents will come, ask questions and get some educational informa - tion. For kids ages 7-12, we've had programs that combine information and support with recreational activities.\" Youngsters often want to know \"if autism is conta - gious, or if a medicine will make it go away.\" Brothers and sisters learn the answers to those questions, get to know other siblings who share their experience, and discuss \"strategies for support and coping.\" Recreational activities, such as Halloween parties, barbeques, and outings to amusement parks and museums, also bring families together. Columbia-Greene Community College President James Campion, M.S.'79, C.G.S.'05, and his wife, Donna Lynk, learned about CARD several years ago after their two younger children, Robert Joshua, now 10, and Elena, 9, were diagnosed with autism. The parents have attended programs explaining \"what autism is and the various kinds of interventions available, and the biological piece to autism.\" They also learned such techniques as \"telling Robert Joshua ahead of time when I'm starting the snowblower or when there's going to be a fire drill\" to avoid problems that might trigger an \"uncomfortable reaction,\" says Campion. The children's 11-year-old sister, Florentina, has also partici - pated in CARD programs, meeting other youngsters with autistic siblings. \"They have a chance to talk, and she knows she has resources,\" Campion notes. CARD has given the family \"a better understanding of autism and of the options available to us in the area, and we've been able to make some good choices. CARD does a great job. It's been a real benefit for us.\" Red Flags Autism usually manifests itself in the first few years of a child's life, according to CARD Director Kristin Christodulu. Some red flags that may indicate a child is at risk for an autism spectrum disorder and in need of immediate evaluation include: inability to make eye contact; or to wave, point, reach or show lack of interest in activities with other people making repetitive motions with objects failure to respond when addressed by name CARD: Helping Families Affected by Autism For more information, please visit www.albany.edu/psy/autism.By Carol Olechowski CARD has benefited James Campion and Donna Lynk, and their children, Elena, Robert Joshua and Florentina.

Christopher Zach Gary Gold '70 UALBANY MAGAZINE 20 Family, health and people helping people\" are the three most important things in life, according to Jordan S. Josephson. Living by that conviction, the board-certified sinus and nasal specialist has built a thriving practice, treating patients from around the world and affording them the same \"personal touch\" he would ensure his own family. An expert on CAID (Chronic Airway-Digestive Inflammatory Disease, which includes sinus problems; allergies, asthma; snor - ing; sleep apnea; and gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD), Josephson likens himself to \"a country doctor in the big city.\" At the New York Nasal and Sinus Center on East 77 Street in Manhattan, he sees patients from around the world. Josephson is also an attending physician at Lenox Hill Hospital; Manhattan Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital; and St. Luke's- Roosevelt Hospital. He is an educator, lecturing and teaching surgeons internationally his technique of functional endoscopic sinus surgery and nasal reconstruction; and a researcher whose work has appeared in more than 40 peer-reviewed journals. A former member of the National Institutes of Health's consulting staff, Josephson received an NIH award for dedication and service, and was similarly recognized by the American Academy of Otolaryngology. New York Magazine named him one of its \"Best Doctors 2004\" as one of 13 innova - tors in medicine, and he has placed numerous times among \"America's Top Doctors\" as compiled by healthcare and research information company Castle Connolly Medical Ltd. In 2006, Josephson wrote Sinus Relief Now (www.sinusre - liefnow.com) to help readers \"really understand their problems.\" The book \"puts the patient on the same page with the physician so that the patient can receive the right comprehensive treat - ment.\" Josephson believes that both Eastern alternative and Western traditional medicines, which are explored in Sinus Relief Now , \"have something to offer people who suffer from sinus disease, allergies, asthma\" and the other CAID-related diseases. Many of these sufferers \"are miserable and are told that they are normal, or that they should live with their prob - lems,\" said the author. \"But no one should have to suffer, as there are solutions\" - ranging from medicines to surgery - \"to help these patients feel better.\" A \"staggering\" 120 million people in the United States alone suffer from these diseases, but, Josephson warns, the figure is rising, owing to \"air pollution and global warming.\" Josephson also carries his message to the masses \"through as many avenues as possible,\" including television (\"Regis \"Fox News,\" \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" and \"Today,\" to name just a few) and radio (appearances on \"hundreds of pro - grams,\" including with Dr. Mehmet Oz, host of Winfrey's Sirius XM broadcast \"Oprah & Friends\"). In addition, he is often quoted in such publications as The New York Times , Allure , Parenting Magazine , Redbook , Men's Health , and the Medical Herald . Recently named the leading consultant on sinus and allergies for WebMD (www.webmd.com), he plans \"various projects\" with the Internet site, including \"a huge no-smoking campaign.\" No matter which means Josephson uses to assist others, he acknowledges that the greatest reward comes in healing the sick. He recalled the time that Oz referred to him a former \"Oprah\" guest - a man who'd suffered a nasal injury as a teenager and who subsequently suffered from snoring, sleep apnea and an inability to breathe through his nose. Josephson performed a thorough examination and discovered, in the patient's mouth, a small cancer that even a CT scan had not detected. He removed the cancer, fixed the breathing and sleep apnea, and the patient is now healthy. Josephson attributes that happy ending to thoroughness and luck. \"A physician needs a good mind, good hands and a good heart,\" he noted, \"and I am lucky that God gave me all of those. Saving this man's life was a very humbling experience. I really love what I do.\" Jordan S.

Jessica Wynne UALBANY MAGAZINE 22 For UAlbany alumnus William Thomas, being named Maryland's 2009 Teacher of the Year has its perks: a new computer, $9,000 in cash and a new $25,000 Saturn Aura. But the biggest reward will be meeting President Barack Obama in April, when Thomas is hon - ored at the White House for his achievement. The 33-year-old Thomas, who earned a teaching B.A. in history from UAlbany, will be thinking about what he'll say when we he meets the presi - dent. Undoubtedly, he'll leave with a story to tell his stu - dents - and another way to make teaching government \"relevant.\" \"It's important to reach stu - dents on their level to bring them to a higher plane,\" said Thomas, who teaches at Dr. Henry A. Wise Jr. High School in Upper Marlboro, Md. In his own life, Thomas has relied on encouraging influences. He grew up in the small town of Ellenville, N.Y., where his parents, Eunice and George Thomas, instilled in him the importance of educa - tion and inspired his path to teaching. While pursuing his degree at UAlbany, he thrived, learning about diverse cultures in history and social studies classes. He enjoyed the University's diverse atmosphere and the student body, and was also challenged by the high expec - tations of his professors. Today, Thomas does the same for his high school stu - dents. \"I want all of the students to believe that I will not give up on them, that I will push them until they succeed,\" he said. In doing so, Thomas has become a role model, particu - larly to African-American stu - dents - a responsibility he rel - ishes. He dresses in a shirt and tie every day, putting into practice the high standards that he preaches in his class - room. His skills and dedica - tion to his students have brought Thomas several offers to become an adminis - trator in the Maryland school system. But he is unwilling to give up his life's calling: teaching. In fact, it's a family calling: His wife, Nicole Thomas, who earned a teaching B.A. in 1996 and an M.S. in reading in 1998, is a 10th-grade English teacher at the same school. Married in 1999, they met at UAlbany, where they shared an interest in the gospel choir and a passion for teaching. Both were finalists for Prince George's County Teacher of the Year. William Thomas garnered that honor, then bested seven candidates from other counties for the statewide award. Still, he maintains he's not the best teacher - either in the state or in his house. \"My wife is the better teacher,\" Thomas admitted with a laugh. \"It's not even close.\" William Thomas, B.A.'97 Presidential Praise By Gina Muscato \"I want all of the students to believe that I will not give up on them, that I will push them until they succeed.\" William Thomas teaches a class at Dr. Henry A. Wise Jr. High School in Upper Marlboro, Md. Brenda Ahearn SPRING 2009 23 For Rebecca Whiteley, joining the Peace Corps fulfilled a longtime dream. \"I always enjoyed volunteer work and helping others. I was torn about what to do after college: grad school, the Peace Corps or the 'real world' of jobs.\" Department of Political Science faculty members Scott Barclay and Thomas Walker \"told me grad school is not to be taken lightly - that you should go only if you are certain what you want to do, which I was not. They also told me that I had the skills and experience necessary for the Peace Corps. Their advice was a real help.\" Now 24, Whiteley majored in political science with a concentration in inter - national relations and graduated with honors. A very active volunteer, she was a member of Students at Albany Against Cancer (SAAC), serving as the group's vice president for a year; and was involved with the University's Relay for Life, Cornerstone Campus Ministries, and the Capital Region's Big Brothers/Big Sisters program. Senior year, she interned with the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants (USCRI) in Albany. That experience motivated her to start a Preferred Refugees Program to help resettle Burmese and Afghan refugees in the Capital Region. To join the Peace Corps, Whiteley completed a lengthy questionnaire, submitted three references, interviewed, and underwent medical and dental screenings. (The application process is described online at www.peacecorps.gov.) She then received \"an invitation\" to serve in the Nisporeni region of Moldova. Whiteley arrived in September 2007 to begin 27 months of service. \"Groups of volunteers were placed in villages with families, and had daily language and technical training for the first 10 weeks.\" As a community and organizational development volunteer, Whiteley helps \"to assess community needs and assist vil - lagers in solving problems.\" She works with two English- optional after-school clubs; \"there is currently no English teacher at the school, but the kids are very anxious to learn!\" In addition, she organizes other extracurricular Rebecca Whiteley, B.S.'07 A Lifelong Dream Realized By Carol Olechowski Rebecca Whiteley, a volunteer with the Peace Corps, works with young people and their families in Moldova. UALBANY MAGAZINE 24 activities, such as a summertime project where she \"helped the kids paint a map of the world at the local youth center\"; a fundraising effort to support the acquisition of Romanian-language books for the school library; and a mentor - ing club. A series of \"planning your future seminars,\" which will instruct children in \"setting up a family budget, planning a career, writing a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and so on,\" is also on the agenda. Each Peace Corps volunteer accrues 48 days of vacation during the service period. Whiteley has traveled to Ukraine, Romania and the Czech Republic, \"and I have more trips planned. I consider Moldova my home now. It can be hard to come back to my village, where there is no gas or running water, and there are dirt roads and farmland, after traveling somewhere full of malls, restaurants and Internet caf\u00e9s. It's a different world, but I appreciate that I am experienc - ing it so fully.\" Next November, Whiteley will return home to Phillipsburg, N.J., with her Moldovan fianc\u00e9, Costel Sarivan. She hopes to work for a non-profit in the U.S. Whiteley observed: \"The Peace Corps has a saying that your service will be 'the toughest job you will ever love,' and I think that is very true. It is a life-changing experience to be able to live and work in another country and completely immerse yourself in that culture, and to help people - abroad or at home. It is a serious commitment, but it is worth it.\" Whiteley and her fianc\u00e9, Costel Sarivan, model Moldovan costumes at a festival. The couple, who met in Moldova, Sarivan's native land, will relo - cate to the United States later this year. UAlbany's School of Public Health (SPH) and the Peace Corps have joined forces to intro - duce the Masters International (MI) Program, which will offer students a Peace Corps experience to complement their master's of public health studies. \"There are 40-some accredited schools of Public Health across the country, and probably eight of them offer the Masters International Program,\" said Center for Global Health Director and Clinical Associate Professor Carol Whittaker, who oversaw the application process that made the rare opportunity possible. SPH Dean Philip C. Nasca is \"extremely pleased to have our school selected as a partner in the MI Program. We join a small and very select group of schools of Public Health offering this unique opportunity for students to prac - tice public health in an interna - tional setting while working towards the M.P.H. degree.\" For the program, students apply to both the Peace Corps and the School of Public Health. About six are expected to enroll this year; they will take two online classes this summer to work toward the degree requirements. After spend - ing the Fall 2009 and Spring 2010 semesters on campus, the students will begin the Peace Corps com - ponent of their studies, which includes three months of language and cultural sensitivity training, and two years of volunteer work. During a final semester at UAlbany, they \"can mentor other students who have expressed an interest in the program,\" Whittaker said. Given the practice-focused schol - arship the longtime partnership between SPH and the New York State Department of Health engenders, UAlbany students will be well prepared for their Peace Corps experience, Whittaker observed. SPH is \"so different from what we call the 'ivory tower' schools of public health. We com - bine academics with practice.\" - Amy Halloran, B.A.'90 SPH and MI: Combining Academics with Practice After graduating from the New York State College for Teachers, Paul T. Reagan taught English and social studies to seventh and eighth graders in the St. Lawrence Central School District in upstate New York. But \"a thirst to see the rest of the world\" led him to volunteer for the Peace Corps. Reagan was assigned to Ethiopia. There, he taught English as a Second Language and social studies to about 200 students, and also conducted adult-education cours - es. The Ethiopians impressed him; \"most lived in poverty, but they didn't live as if they had hardships. They were hard working, good natured, fun loving - and skepti - cal about outsiders.\" Reagan embraced his work, grateful for \"the ability to see cul - tures I might never have experienced. I took away from the Peace Corps and Ethiopia many friendships.\" In the decades since, the licensed clinical social worker (LCSW-R) has continued a lifelong commitment to service. In the mid-1960s, through the first Peace Corps training program at the University at Albany, Reagan prepared students for service in India. At the Dutchess County Department of Mental Hygiene in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., he worked with severely and persistently mentally ill adults and with the methadone maintenance treatment program, retiring several years ago. Reagan has also trained volunteers for VISTA (Volunteers in Service to America); aided migrant worker families, the poor and the unemployed in western and southern New York; and done needs assessments for community-action agencies in Vermont and New Hampshire. He ran for the New York State Senate in the 41st District, hoping to \"make a difference,\" but lost to the incumbent. However, Reagan did realize another \"lifetime ambition\": completing his M.S.W. studies. At age 71, Reagan is still helping others. Now a volunteer supervi - sor with the American Red Cross' Disaster Services Human Resources System, he offered assistance at the scene of the Continental Connection Flight 3407 crash near Buffalo, N.Y., last February. Reagan encourages UAlbany students, alumni, faculty and staff to consider volunteering for the American Red Cross, the Peace Corps and other not-for-profit organizations.

UALBANY MAGAZINE 26 THE FUTURE IS NOW! Is now a good time to explore a new career? Launch a business? Return to school? Some University at Albany alumni, faculty and staff experts say there's never been a better time - so long as you remember that opportunity, networking and passion are all keys to a brighter future. If you're exploring the job market, Marie R. Rabideau, associate director of Career Services ( www.albany.edu/cdc ), recommends that you: Revise your r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Career Services staff will be happy to critique it and offer suggestions for strengthening it, such as including more \"industry buzzwords\" and/or tailoring it to the specific kind of position you are applying for. We work very actively with our alumni to provide services that range from career counseling and coaching to r\u00e9sum\u00e9 writing to job search. Noah Simon, the primary contact for alumni, can be reached via e-mail at nsimon@uamail.albany.edu. By registering with Career Services via our Web site, you will gain access to our job database and other valuable resources. Refresh and improve your interviewing skills. Career Services staff offer mock (practice) interviews with valuable feedback. As the saying goes, \"practice makes perfect.\" Explore all career options, including possible relocation. Skills are transferrable and can be applied across many disciplines. Keep in mind that some areas of our country have been impacted to a lesser extent than others during this recession; do your research and find out which states' labor markets are healthier than others. Also, research what sectors are still hiring. The federal government and healthcare are great examples.Visit http://www.makingthedifference.org to see opportunities available with the federal government. Finally, network! Phone or e-mail your family, friends and acquaintances, and let them know that you are looking for a new position. Getting a lead, as well as a good word, from these sources can make a real difference. Pass your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 on so they can forward it to their contacts. Reach out to the career center at the nearest college or university, and ask about their reciprocation agreement with your alma mater . While the offerings through that agreement will not likely encompass the full array of services available to that institution's native students, they will allow you access to some key tools through which to conduct a directed job search. 1 2 43www.nyssbdc.org www.albany.edu/cdc If you're thinking about consulting, or starting your own business, William Brigham, director of UAlbany's Small Business Development Center (www.nyssbdc.org), suggests that you: Consider self-employment. Skills acquired on the job often convert to a successful small business enterprise. With corporations downsizing professional staff to increase the bottom line, a high demand for management consultants exists. Another alternative is starting or acquiring your lifetime-dream business. Whether it's a home-based, online, retail, wholesale, manufacturing or service busi - ness, you need a solid, objective business plan. Use such resources as the Small Business Development Center, which offers business assistance, or your state's Self-Employment Assistance Program, which allows unemployed entrepreneurs to collect benefits while starting a business. Get the economic gloom and doom out of your head. Recessions are relatively short lived. All trade does not stop during a downturn, and many large companies are dropping smaller customers to concentrate on high-volume customers. This is one of many market niches that recessionary periods create. Assess your situation. A third-party review by your accountant or a friend, col - league, consultant or business advisor can identify financial or operational problems, and afford time to reverse downward trends. Small businesses can be agile and creative in initiating change, reacting quickly to cut costs, entering new markets, adjusting the marketing mix and so on. A Band-Aid now could prevent trauma later . 1 2 3SPRING 2009 27 Paul Stewart, B.A.'74, manager of Training and Technical Assistance for the Capital District Community Loan Fund, Inc. ( www.cdclf.org ), shares these tips: Do the business plan! Not doing one increases the chances of failure. A business plan is a road map that explains how you plan to organize the business and shows how you addressed such issues as who your principal competition is, how your business differs, who your customers are and how you will manage funds. Have a good idea of the resources, skills and added outreach your business needs, and look for inexpensive ways to address them. One example: An article in a local newspaper is a good advertisement for a business. And it's free. Familiarize yourself with changes in technology. The Internet can help you. More and more businesses are utilizing e-mail to contact and retain customers. Blogging will tell the world about your business, and share the latest news about your products or services. Facebook, MySpace and other social-networking sites can also attract customers and stimulate sales.Donald S. Siegel, dean of the School of Business ( www.albany.edu/business ), notes that the economic downturn is \"the ideal time for would-be entrepre - neurs, especially those who have suffi- cient financial capital. Perhaps that is why so many great firms - GE; Hewlett Packard; Disney; Microsoft; and more recently, Method, RF Micro Devices, and Clif Bar - were launched during recessions and depressions.\" As a would-be entrepreneur, you should: Focus on the customer. For example, many organizations are desperately trying to reduce costs, which can present opportunities for entrepreneurial firms. Provide unique value. That is how you will increase market share. Even when the economy is sour, people will purchase what they need and will be looking for greater value, which large firms may not be able to provide, since they have downsized. Be willing to devote your life to the new enterprise. Otherwise, you are likely to fail. This tip is independent of the business cycle, but passion is critical.If you're considering a return to school, Robert Bangert-Drowns, acting dean of UAlbany's School of Education ( www.albany.edu/educa - tion ), recommends that you: Consider contacting faculty who teach in the area that interests you. Deans or department chairs can answer your questions about the program, areas of faculty expertise and the career options in the field, and compare those with your own goals, experiences and accomplishments. Go to school with an open mind. Students often come to higher education with expectations about what they want from it, and while it's great to have clear goals, they sometimes get in the way of learning. Pay attention to the many opportunities that will enrich you in ways you hadn't expected. Sometimes, pursuing a degree will awaken you to a hidden talent or a new interest. Leave your ego at the door. Take grades, even bad ones, as opportunities to learn, not state - ments about you as a person. Enjoy yourself. You may feel out of place at first, but it won't be long until you feel you've found your place in a course or a department.1 2 31 2 31 2 3 www.cdclf.org www.albany.edu/business www.albany.edu/education UALBANY MAGAZINE 28 A note from your class councilor: What a privilege it has been for us to have been the Class of 1935! What a journey through time we have experienced since first we entered State 78 years ago. How sharp some memo - ries are of our student days during the Great Depression; how dim have pictures become of even momentous events since we graduated. We have seen World War II, the Korean War and Vietnam. We have lived through an uneasy truce during the Cold War, and then have seen the unbe - lievable changes since the collapse of communism in Russia. The world econ - omy has become intertwined as never before and now we hear once more the dreaded word DEPRESSION. We hope that with new awareness more modern solutions will prevent repetition of a cat - aclysmic cycle. What brings on this ten - dency to philosophize?

For many years, he and Edna always carried the '35 banner in the processions on cam - pus. We shall miss him greatly.

Baker holds a unique distinc - tion in University at Albany history: His affiliation with the institution and its predecessor, the New York State College for Teachers (NYSCT), spans more than seven decades. Born in 1910, Baker attended Defiance College in Ohio. Two years later, he transferred to NYSCT, where he majored in social studies. After earning an M.A. in political science from Columbia University and a Ph.D. from Johns Hopkins, Baker returned to NYSCT and joined the Department of Social Studies. His interest and expertise in American government and politics earned Baker the abiding respect of students who enrolled in his courses, which included American Government , American Parties and Politics , Constitutional Law , and State and Local Government in New York . A member of Phi Beta Kappa and such professional organizations as the Social Science Research Council, he also wrote The National Bituminous Coal Commission Administration of the Bituminous Coal Act in 1941. Baker taught at NYSCT from 1939 until his retirement in 1968. His only times away from the college during his 30-year career, Baker notes, were \"two-year interruptions for military service during World War II and for academic study.\" After retirement, he spent several months traveling the world. Recognizing that financial assistance is essential for students, particularly today, Baker established a bequest at UAlbany to support the Ralph H. and Dora W . Baker Scholarship Fund in Political Science . Named for the professor emeritus and his beloved wife, the for - mer Dora Williamson, to whom he was married for nearly 74 years until her passing in 2008, the scholarship will benefit full-time undergraduates majoring in political science.

A social studies major who minored in mathematics and German, he participated in intramural football, basketball, volleyball and wrestling; joined the Kappa Beta fraternity; and wrote for the State College News . (His columns were often critical of school spirit - and of some faculty, as well.) During his senior year, Milk served as the News' sports editor. In addition to trying his hand at journalism and sports, the Long Island native took an interest in campus politics. He ran for freshman class president but lost, placing third out of four candidates. After graduation, Milk served in the military during the Korean War and later worked as an investment banker in New York. In the 1970s, he headed to San Francisco, where he ran unsuccessfully for the Board of Supervisors three times before being elected in 1977, the first openly gay public official to win election in California. At San Francisco City Hall in November 1978, Milk was assassinated, along with Mayor George Moscone. Their former colleague, ex-Supervisor Dan White, who had resigned from the board and was subsequently denied reappointment by Moscone, confessed to the crime. Convicted only of voluntary manslaughter, White served just five years' prison time. He committed suicide a few years later. \"Milk\" chronicled the political rise of Harvey Milk, along with details of his personal life and his activism on behalf of gays. The film earned star Sean Penn an Academy Award for Best Actor, as well as a Screen Actors Guild award for best performance by a male lead in a movie and a Golden Globe nomination for lead actor in a drama. \"Milk\" also received an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay.

She has fond childhood memories of visiting old-fashioned ice cream parlors with her family in her native Queens, N.Y. As an undergraduate psychology and sociology major at UAlbany, she worked at a local ice cream shop to earn money for school, learning the business in the process. When Riddell and her husband, Voorheesville High School science teacher Ken Young, B.S. '88, M.S.'92, went on vacation, she would take along a 300-page guide, The Very Best Ice Cream and Where to Find It. So when she discovered a vacant building on Delaware Avenue in Albany in 2007, she took that as a sign that the time was right to go into business. It was: The shop - one of only 20 outlets of the Boston-based Emack & Bolio's, and the chain's first upstate New York venue - opened right at the start of a four-day heat wave in June 2008. Crowds flocked there to sample ice cream and fresh-squeezed lemonade in the big outdoor garden. Last winter, customers warmed themselves by the fireplace, listening to soothing music from a jukebox as they sipped mouth-watering cocoa, caf\u00e9 mocha, espresso macchiato and chai. Of course, the \"really fabulous\" gourmet ice cream, \"invented and made by Emack & Bolio's founder Bob Rook,\" is a year-round draw. Such unique flavors as Deep Purple Cow, Peanut Butter Oreo, Caramel Moose Prints and Cake Batter are staples; others, including Albany EGG Cream and Nipper's Doggie Sundae, were inspired by Capital Region landmarks. (Riddell's own favorite is Serious Chocolate Addiction.) Emack & Bolio's is located in one of Riddell and Young's favorite neighborhoods. As UAlbany students, Young, who majored in atmospheric science and earned a master's in science educa - tion, and Riddell, a former Voorheesville High counselor who also holds both a master's and a certificate of advanced study in counseling psy - chology, socialized downtown with friends. \"I remember digging out cars on Ontario and Quail streets, near the Alumni Quad dorms, where we lived,\" said Riddell, a former Voorheesville counselor who appreciates the \"very affordable, high-quality education\" UAlbany provided. The couple \"went camping the University's Outing Club; on campus, Riddell \"loved studying by the fountain in the spring.\" She still keeps in touch with her friends from University days. Most of them live in the Albany area: \"Nobody wanted to go home! We all just ended up staying.\" Now residents of Slingerlands, Riddell and Young have two children, Ben, 12, and Abby, 9. Riddell admitted: \"I can't wait to put them to work! They're still too young, but it's been fun for them to watch the shop come together.\" - Anna Lempereur Anna Lempereur is a junior journalism major from Levittown, N.Y.

The Woodstock, N.Y., native enrolled at UAlbany because the University \"had, and has, a great political science department. UAlbany provides a great opportunity to get ahead in any career you choose.\" Brenowitz, who also minored in Judaic studies, had considered journalism as a career, \"as well as something along the lines of working with a political think tank.\" He now works for the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS) in Tel Aviv and is studying for a master's in Middle Eastern studies at Tel Aviv University. Brenowitz didn't participate in sports at UAlbany, but he'd played \"in wooden-bat leagues in Queens and The Bronx,\" and joined an intramural league after moving to Israel. When he heard that a professional league was forming there, \"I began to train, get in shape and focus on at least being offered a spot.\" Selected for the league, he played catcher. The Israel Baseball League has six teams, including the Blue Sox. Players hail from Israel and several other nations, including the United States, the Dominican Republic, Japan, Canada and Australia. Summertime - baseball season in Israel - \"can be very, very hot, about 100 degrees-plus.\" The Blue Sox overcame the heat, however, and won the league's 2008 World Series. Brenowitz is proud of the teamwork that con - tributed to the victory, which \"came at the end of a seven- week season. We played six games a week; it was very rigor- ous. The absolute best part was my teammates. We had a very unique team - something that came together naturally. We worked together, helped one another and functioned as if we had been playing together all of our lives. No ego, no machismo, no arrogance. Just baseball and genuine teamwork,\" he recalls. Although unsure of his plans after he finishes school, Brenowitz is \"certain that I will play baseball wherever I may be. I look up to my father; he is 63 and can throw better than most guys I know. He travels to Florida once a year to play in an over-60 league. For us, baseball is a way of life.\" - Carol Olechowski SPRING 2009 41 Alumni News and Notes Wealth Manager magazine's annual \"Top Dogs\" report has ranked John Lapann 's company, Federal Street Advisors, as No. 1 among independent wealth management firms.

Bright and engaged, the undergraduates come to my English class ready to speak their minds. A few of them are just brilliant. Oh, and the campus here at Georgetown, where I am on leave from the University at Albany, is picture per - fect: a genteel mix of new and old brick. A grassy quad sits in front of an elegant old building with towers and spires and charcoal grey stone. But as I stroll past that building return - ing to my office after my noon-hour seminar, I picture some of the earnest faces of the students who have passed through my UAlbany classrooms. That's when it hits me: I miss UAlbany. I miss the students I love so much. I miss the very public-ness of the university where I carved my identity as a teacher. For so many UAlbany students I've had the privilege of teaching - many of whom are in the Educational Opportunities Program - the state uni - versity was their only affordable option. Without SUNY, their educational loss would be immense. The students here at Georgetown, by contrast, have the great luxury of choice. If they hadn't gone to Georgetown, they would probably be at some other private university where the brick and grass and stone mix with plenty of academic opportunity. It's not that Georgetown isn't incredible, because it is. But so is UAlbany. It is a fine school that has made an extraordi - nary difference in so many thousands of lives - including my own. A whole new world opened up to me after I earned my Ph.D. in 1996. My daughter, a transfer who studied Latin and Caribbean Studies - which she adored - proudly earned her diploma in May 2008. When I did my doctoral work at UAlbany, I already had a B.A. from Brown University and a master's from the University of California at Berkeley. I was well acquainted with public and private education. What I found at UAlbany were some of the most inspira - tional teachers I'd ever had, wonderful role models as I began my own teaching career in 1998. I am very grateful to have this sabbatical experience here in Washington, D.C., especially at this pivotal time in our nation's history. But something has become very clear to me since moving here in January: I am incredibly proud to be a teacher at a public university. My heart and soul are deeply embedded in the vitally important enterprise that is public education. The Last Word By Claudia Ricci, Ph.D.'96 Claudia Ricci, a faculty member with UAlbany's journalism program and the Educational Opportunity Program (EOP), was formerly a staff writer for The Wall Street Journal and an award-winning reporter for the Chicago Sun- Times . Her first novel, Dreaming Maples , was published in 2002. She is pictured here with her daughter - and fellow UAlbany alumna - Lindsay Kirsch, B.A.'08. UAlbany world up to me.\" Juliette Zivic and her husband, Jerry, know a good thing when they see it. That's why they decided to establish a Charitable Gift Annuity (CGA) through The University at Albany Foundation. Through the CGA, the Zivics - who also have a bequest intention with the University - are supporting a scholarship fund. \"Students will benefit,\" Juliette says. \"The University will benefit. And we are getting a nice income - better than the market could provide. It gives us pleasure to think we are helping somebody who is trying to get ahead. Everybody wins.\" UAlbany \"has been very good to me,\" adds Juliette, who credits the late Distinguished Service Professor of English M.E. Grenander with helping her to polish her expository writing skills. Those skills later proved \"incred - ibly useful\" in Juliette's work at Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory in New York, and then at Public Service of New Hampshire and Nortel Networks. The Zivics are pleased with their decision to fund a CGA. Says Juliette: \"There are very few things in life where everybody wins, so that appealed to us. My husband and I really enjoy the idea of being able to give back a little bit.\" Juliette Zivic, B.A.'72, and Jerry Zivic Gkvk g Bacn Charitable Gift Annuities Many people are now seeking a safe harbor - a place that will protect their money and afford them a reasonable return. A Charitable Gift Annuity with The University at Albany Foundation will allow you to: Make a contribution to The Foundation and receive a fixed income for one or two lives, either immediately or at a future date, with the payments partially tax free. Receive an income-tax deduc - tion on a portion of the gift. Direct how the proceeds will eventually be used: for scholar - ships or awards, research or library support, or a host of other educational priorities. The income you receive for life will be a constant amount, based on your age and the date you establish the Gift Annuity. It's a good way to attain a safe harbor - and do some good!
