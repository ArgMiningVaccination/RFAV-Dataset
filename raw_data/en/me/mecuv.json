Zun, MD Professor Emergency Medicine Chicago Medical School Chair Emergency Medicine Mount Sinai Hospital Chicago, Illinois Preface We wrote this book because we remember our own experiences as medical students and junior residents working in the emergency department (ED). The ED is a unique environment that requires knowledge and skills often not covered in medical or physician assistant school. In this book, we attempt to create a resource for the medical student, physician assis\u00ad tant, nurse practitioner, and junior-level resident to use to get a grasp on the issues and scope of problems that they will confront while working in the ED. The book's length and format are designed to allow the student and practitioner to begin to digest the broad range of topics inherent to emergency medicine (EM). Each chapter begins with a section on Key Points, followed by an Introduction, Clinical Presentation (History and Physical Examinat ion), Diagnostic Studies, Medical Decision Making, Treatment, and Disposition. Whenever possible, we tried to give practical information regarding drug dosing, medical decision-making thought processes, treatment plans, and dispositions that will actually allow you to function more com\u00ad fortably in the clinical environment. The diagnostic algorithms are a unique feature that attempt to simplify the problem and point the clinician in the right direction. The book has 19 sections and 98 chapters that cover the entire contents of the EM clerkship curriculum (Acad Emerg Med. 201 0; 17:638-643). The authors are all practicing emergency physicians and EM educators from through\u00ad out the country. For medical student clerkship directors, we believe that this text is the perfect book for the student to pick up and digest during a 4-week rotation. In summary, we hope this book will enhance the emergency medicine experience of all its users. xvi Scott C. Sherman, MD Joseph M. Weber, MD Michael Schindlbeck, MD Rahul Patwari, MD Acknowledgments We have many people to thank in helping us bring this project to fruition. First and foremost, this text would have never made it to print without the support and encouragement of our McGraw-Hill editor, Anne Sydor. Anne is a friend as much as an editor. She took a chance on us and for that we will always be grateful. One of Anne's many gifts has been providing us with such great editorial support in the form of Sarah M. Granlund. She has been the quarterback of this project from the onset, and without her planning and attention to detail, we would not be here today. We would also like to acknowledge our project manager, Charu Khanna, for her attention to detail during page proofs and willingness to go the extra mile. We also want to thank our \"bosses;' Jeff Schaider and Steve Bowman. Jeff is a constant source of enthusiasm for the aca\u00ad demic project in whatever form makes his faculty happy. He is a mentor, role model, and friend to us all. Steve, our residency director, also deserves so much credit. He shoulders the burden of one of the largest residencies in the country in a way that allows his assistants to pursue the true pleasures of the academic job in emergency medicine. Thank you both. Estella Bravo, Ethel Lee, Mishelle Taylor, Deloris Johnson, and Hilda Nino also deserve a load of credit for the support they provide in the offices. Estella has been the dream clerkship coordinator, managing 24 students per month with grace and deter\u00ad mination. She sets the bar high and makes our students feel comfortable during their time with us. For those who consider becoming a clerkship director one day, the most important consideration is making sure you have someone like Estella at the reins of the coordinator position. Several groups of people also deserve high praise. Our authors have turned in an outstanding product, making the job of editing so much easier. We have tried to assemble an \"all-star\" group of contributors, and based on what came back to us, we were not disappointed. We all benefit from the hard work and expertise of our authors after \"too many years to count\" spent working in emergency departments and educating eager learners in the field. We also want to acknowledge our students and residents. You folks are the driving force behind all of our efforts. You inspire, test, and humble us on a daily basis. Lastly, and most importantly, we would like to thank our patients. We learn what our patients teach us, and so any learning we have accom\u00ad plished over the years is attributed to them. They are the true educators of emergency medicine, and we owe them a debt of gratitude. xvii This page intentionally left blank Incision and Drainage David E. Manthey, MD Key Points Incision and drainage is the procedure of choice for subcutaneous abscesses. Antibiotics are not necessary unless there is associated cellulitis. INDICATIONS Incision and drainage (I&D) is the definitive treatment for any subcutaneous abscess. Abscesses should be drained if larger than 5 mm and accessible to percutaneous inci\u00ad sion. Antibiotics alone are not adequate treatment of an abscess. In fact, skin abscesses without surrounding cel\u00ad lulitis, once drained, do not require any further treatment with antibiotics. Abscesses can be diagnosed by physical examination based on swelling, pain, redness, and fluctuance (Figure 1-1). Some abscesses will spontaneously drain, leaving little diag\u00ad nostic doubt. Bedside ultrasound may aid in diagnosis by identifying a hypoechoic area of fluid just under the skin. Needle aspiration may also be employed to prove the pres\u00ad ence of pus. Abscesses are often denoted by various names depend\u00ad ing on their location and/or structure involved. The treat\u00ad ment remains the same. Paronychia and eponychia form around the nail (Figure 1-2). Felons occur with infection of the volar pad of the finger and require a specific approach for drainage. Bartholin gland abscesses occur in the paired glands that provide moisture to the vestibule of the vaginal mucosa. When the opening becomes occluded, either an abscess or a cyst can develop. After I&D, a Word catheter is placed to insure continued drainage of the gland. Removal or marsupialization of the gland may be required to pre\u00ad vent recurrence. 1 Abscesses should be probed with curved hemostats to break up loculations and identify deeper tracks. Local anesthesia may be difficult and require additional field block, parenteral analgesics, or sedation. Hidradenitis suppurativa the apocrine glands in the axilla, inguinal area, or both. Multiple abscesses can form and eventually lead to draining fistulous tracts that require surgical management. I&D of these abscesses is frequently necessary and performed in the emergency department. Incision and drainage may also be used to treat infected pilonidal or sebaceous cysts. Further treatment by a .A. Figure 1-1. A subcutaneous abscess in an intravenous drug user. CHAPTER 1 Figure 1-2. Paronychia. surgeon will often include removing the capsule to prevent recurrence. Perirectal abscesses include superficial abscesses (ie, perianal), which can be drained by emergency physicians, and deeper abscesses (ie, ischiorectal, intersphincteric, supralevat or), which require operative surgical drainage. Perianal abscesses present as tender, fluctuant masses pal\u00ad pated around the anal verge. Deeper abscesses often pres\u00ad ent with rectal pain, pain with defecation, rectal and buttock erythema and tenderness, and systemic symptoms ( ie, fever, lethargy). CONTRAINDICATIONS Cellulitis without evidence of underlying abscess should not be incised. Pulsatile masses that may be infected pseu\u00ad doaneuryms should not be incised. Extremely large or deep abscesses should be considered for drainage under anesthesia. As a result of transient bac\u00ad teremia, those patients at risk for endocarditis owing to an artificial or abnormal heart valve should be given appro\u00ad priate perioperative antibiotics. Abscesses of the palms, soles, nasolabial fold, breasts, finger pads (felons), face, and deeper perirectal region can be associated with complications. Consider consultation with the appropriate surgical subspecialty. EQUIPMENT Povidone-iodine solution or chlorhexidine solution to cleanse the skin Anesthetic 1 o/o inject local guard or 18-gauge angiocatheter (without needle) 30-mL syringe irrigation Sterile water or normal saline for Gloves, gown, and facemask with shield (universal precautio ns) Gauze and tape PROCEDURE Discuss the risks and benefits of the procedure with the patient before obtaining consent. Verify abscess location with ultrasound if necessary. Wash your hands and wear gloves, gown, and a face shield, as many abscesses are under pressure. Position the patient and lighting to allow for the best visualization and access to the abscess. Prepare the area with povidone-iodine solution or chlorhexidine. Utilizing a 27-gauge needle, inject the anesthetic just under the dermis parallel to the surface of the skin. Blanching of the tissue will occur as the anesthetic spreads out through the skin. Cover the entire area to be incised. Avoid injecting lidocaine into the abscess cavity. This may increase the pressure in the cavity causing more pain. For larger abscesses, local field blocks, parenteral analgesics, and/or procedural sedation may be necessary. If it is unclear whether an abscess exists, attempt aspira\u00ad tion of pus with a syringe and an 18-or 20-gauge needle. If confirmed, use an 11-blade scalpel to make a single inci\u00ad sion in the skin. The incision should be at the point of maximal fluctuance oriented in the long axis of the abscess. In general, the incision should extend two thirds of the diameter of the abscess cavity (except when draining Bartholin gland abscesses, for which only an incision 0.5-1 em should be made). Attempt to incise parallel to existing skin tension lines to promote cosmetic results. Use gentle and steady pressure around the abscess to express pus from the cavity. Insert a curved hemostat to break loculations by working in a clockwise fashion around the entire abscess cavity. This will also help identify any deeper tracks. If desired, obtain a culture of the wound at this time. Consider gentle irrigation of the wound until the fluid returning is clear. Pack the wound with enough iodoform gauze to keep the sides of the abscess from touching. This will allow for further drainage. Cover the wound with gauze. When treating a Bartholin gland abscess, a small cath\u00ad eter (Word catheter) is placed in the opening instead of iodoform. The catheter should remain in place for several weeks to allow for the development of a fistula for contin\u00ad ued drainage. INCISION AND DRAINAGE The patient is instructed to follow up in 48 hours to have the packing removed. If pus is no longer present and symptoms are resolving, the wound is allowed to heal by secondary intention. COMPLICATIONS Scarring from the abscess and incision will occur. Numbness from cutaneous nerve injury may occur. Seeding of the blood with bacteria may transiently occur. SUGGESTED READING Fitch MT, Manthey DE, McGinnis HD, et al. Abscess incision and drainage.

Kitamura, MD John Sarka, MD Key Points Arterial puncture for blood gas analysis is a common procedure performed in the emergency department (ED). Blood obtained from the radial artery can be used to quickly provide quantitative information on the INDICATIONS The primary indication for obtaining an arterial blood sample is for the assessment of the partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide and accurate assessment of arterial pH. Secondarily, arterial blood can be analyzed for carboxyhemoglobin, methemoglobin, and basic elec\u00ad trolytes depending on the capabilities of the laboratory. Under certain circumstances it may be necessary to obtain a sample of arterial blood for other routine labo\u00ad ratory tests, such as in patients who are obese or have a history of intravenous drug abuse, in whom the radial artery is palpable, but venous access is difficult or may be delayed. CONTRAINDICATIONS There are few absolute contraindications for arterial punc\u00ad ture for blood gas analysis. Trauma, infection, or abnor\u00ad malities of the overlying skin such as a burn are contraindications because of concern for infection or fur\u00ad ther damage to the vascular structures. Patients with known coagulopathies, taking anticoagulants, or who may require thrombolytic agents should be approached with caution because of the increased risk of bleeding, hema\u00ad toma formation, or rarely, compartment syndrome. Finally, a known history of insufficient blood flow through the 4 patient's acid-base status and carboxyhemoglobin , methemog lobin, and electrolyte levels. Arterial puncture is a useful way to obtain blood for analysis when traditional phlebotomy is limited or dif\u00ad ficult on the basis of patient characteristics. palmar arch or previous surgery to the radial or ulnar arteries should also be considered a contraindication. The Allen test, described later, has been used as a way to deter\u00ad mine adequacy of collateral circulation, however, its neces\u00ad sity has been questioned. EQUIPMENT Many commercially prepared kits for arterial puncture are available, and if a commercial kit is not available, then equipment is easily found in most EDs. The following equipment is typically used to perform the procedure (Figure 2-1). Required Equipment Alcohol, chlorhexidine, or iodine 23-to 25-gauge needle Syringe cap Appropriate personal protective equipment Gauze or other dressing Suggested Equipment Anesthetic (eg, lidocaine) Ultrasound or Doppler (if the artery is difficult to palpate) ARTERIAL BLOOD GAS Figure 2-1. Equipment used for an arterial puncture. Rolled towel or kidney basin (to stabilize and extend the wrist) Ice (for specimen process times> 10 minutes) Local anesthesia is not strictly required for the procedure; however, studies have shown that pain, as well as the number of attempts required to obtain a sample, are reduced when appropriate anesthesia is provided. Traditionally, 1% lidocaine is used, avoiding epinephrine because of concern for vasospasm. Recent studies have suggested that jet-injected 2% lidocaine also provides reasonable anesthesia. PROCEDURE Before selecting an appropr iate wrist, the Allen test may be used to assess collateral circulati on. Manually occlude the radial and ulnar arteries using your fingers. Ask the patient to clench the fist to increase venous drainage from the hand for approximately 30 seconds. Ask the patient to open the hand, which should be noticeably pale. At this point, release only the ulnar artery. Rapid return of color signifies adequa te collateral flow. Although the necessity of the test for arterial puncture is questioned, common sense dictates that if collateral flow in one wrist is noticea bly decreased compared with the other, the wrist with better collateral flow should be accessed. In the absence of good collateral flow in both wrists, the necessity of the procedure should be weighed against the remote risk of serious vascular injury and distal extremity ischemia. The radial artery is easily palpated in a majority of patients. It runs down the radial aspect of the forearm, generally located between the styloid process of the radius and the flexor carpi radialis tendon at the .A. Figure 2-2. Position of the forearm for puncture of the radial artery. A kidney basin or rolled towel may be helpful to hold the patient's wrist in this position. proximal crease of the wrist. The patient's wrist should be extended to bring the artery to a more superficial position. A kidney basin or rolled towel as well as tape may be helpful to hold the patient's wrist in this posi \u00ad tion (Figure 2-2). The skin overlying the artery should be cleaned. The skin and immediate sub cutaneous tissue should then be appropriately anesthetized. The authors recommend massaging the area or letting it rest for 1-2 minutes for the anesthetic to take comp lete effect. This time may be used to prepare your other equipment. After locating the impulse of the artery with the non\u00ad dominate hand, take the syringe and needle in your domi\u00ad nate hand and slowly advance the needle toward the impulse at a 30- to 45-degree angle proximally toward the patient. If the impulse is difficult to detect, an ultrasound or Doppler may be helpful to locate the artery (Figure 2-3). Some practitioners use a direct 90-degree angle to the skin, but this is largely a matter of preference. When the artery is accessed, blood will passively fill the syringe. It should not be necessary to draw back on the syringe. Pulsatile or bright red blood signals the correct vessel has been accessed; however, this may not be apparent in the criti\u00ad cally ill patient. If blood is not obtained, withdraw the needle to just below the skin and reattempt the procedure after slight adjustments have been made. Do not move the needle in an arc deep in the skin, as this risks damage to the vascular structures. After blood is collected, the needle should be removed and disposed of appropria tely. Remove air from the syringe and place the syringe cap, ensuring that blood contacts the cap. Maintain pressure over the arterial site for approxi\u00ad mately 5 minutes to prevent development of a hematoma, and dress the wound appropria tely.

Kysia, MD Key Points The ability to access the central venous circulation is an imperative skill for emergency physicians and is often needed for life-saving measures. The central venous circulation can be accessed both above and below the diaphragm. The site should be INDICATIONS The most common reason for placement of a central venous catheter in the emergency department (ED) is for resuscitation of the critically ill medical or trauma patient. Medical patients may require central access for large vol\u00ad ume fluid resuscitation, central venous pressure monitor\u00ad ing, IV pressors or other medicatio ns caustic to the peripheral hypertonic saline, total paren\u00ad teral nutrition ), transvenous pacing, or emergent dialysis. Trauma patients most often require central access for large-volume resuscitation with both fluids and blood. Central access is also used in ED patients with difficult peripheral IV access. CONTRAINDICATIONS Central access should not be attempted when peripheral access is obtainable and no other indication is present. Central access should be avoided at sites with overlying cellulitis or other anatomic abnormalities such as extensive trauma that may cause distorted anatomic landmarks. Known coagulop athy is an absolute contraindication to subclavian vein cannulation (noncompressible site) and a relative contraindication for internal jugular and femoral cannulation. Finally, patients must be able to cooperate during the procedure by remaining still. An uncooperative 8 chosen based on reason for access as well as body habitus and pattern of injury for trauma patients. Although the overall complication rate for central line placement is low for experienced providers, serious complications may occur. patient is a relative contraindication that may require seda\u00ad tion before the procedure. EQUIPMENT Most of the equipment needed to perform central venous cannulation can be found in commer cially available central line kits (Figure 3-1). Kits dilator, central line, and silk suture on a cutting needle. There are multiple types of central lines. In general, 1 of 2 types is used in the ED (Figure 3-2). A triple-lumen cath\u00ad eter is used for patients who require multiple different medication drips or when there is difficulty obtaining peripheral venous access. A sheath introducer (Cordis) cath\u00ad eter is shorter and wider and is used for introducing trans\u00ad venous pacers, Swan-Ganz catheters, and for rapid infusion of fluid and blood products in the hypotensive patient. These larger catheters can achieve flow rates up to 1 L/min. PROCEDURE The procedure including risks and benefits should be completely explained to the pa tient or their representa\u00ad tive. Informed consent should be obtained unless the CENTRAL VENOUS ACCESS Figure 3-1. Triple lumen kit. procedure is performed emergently. First locate the appropr iate anatomical landmarks for the chosen site (see later). Next, apply povidone-iodine to the area of needle insertion followed by the sterile dra pe. Then .A. Figure 3-2. From left to right: A. sheath introducer kit (Cordis) with dilator. B. Triple lumen catheter. C. triple lumen dilator. anesthetize the area of needle insertion with lidocaine. Once the preparation is complete, Seldinger technique should be followed in a stepwise fashion to complete the procedure . ..... Seldinger Technique 1. Use a large-bore needle with syringe to cannulate the vein. There should be free flow of dark nonpulsatile blood into the syringe with traction on plunger (Figure 3-3A). 2. Thread the guidewire through the needle until 3-5 em of the guidewire remains (Figure 3-3B). If resistance is met, withdraw the wire and confirm that the needle is in the vessel. Attempt to rethread the wire. 3. When the guidewire is in place, remove the needle (Figure 3-3C). Never let go of the guidewire during any part of the procedure because it can migrate fully into the vessel. 4. Using a #11 blade scalpel, make a superficial stab inci\u00ad sion in the skin at the site that the guidewire enters (Figure 3-3D). 5. Pass the dilator over the wire and thread into the vessel (Figure 3-3E). (For the Cordis catheter, the dilator and catheter are inserted together.) 6. Remove the dilator and thread the triple lumen over the wire, backing out the wire until it protrudes 2-3 em out of the brown port. 7. Holding the free wire with one hand, thread the line into the vein (Figure 3-3F). 8. Remove the wire and confirm placement with aspira\u00ad tion of blood (Figure 3-3G). Secure the catheter in place with suture. Internal jugular vein cannulation can be achieved by multiple approaches. The central approach is described here (Figure 3-4). Position the patient supine and in slight Trendelenburg position, with the head rotated 75 degrees to the opposite side. Palpate the triangle formed by the 2 heads of the sternocleidoma stoid muscle. Palpate the carotid artery pulse within this triangle. The vein is lateral to the artery in this location and is widest just below the level of the cricoid cartilage. Insert the needle at the apex of the triangle, aiming toward the ipsi\u00ad lateral nipple with 30 degrees of angulation. The vein should be entered within 2-3 em of needle advancement. If unsuccessful, withdraw slowly, as the vessel, if punc\u00ad tured, may have been compressed during advancement and will be pulled open on withdrawal. Do not palpate the carotid pulse while attempting to cannulate the inter\u00ad nal jugular vein. The slight compression that results can compress the vein, making it more difficult to access. Cannulation of the right internal jugular is preferred over the left because of the straight line into the right atrium CHAPTER 3 Figure 3-3. The Seldinger technique.

Lange, 1981.) and the presence of the thoracic duct and a higher pleural dome on the left side. The subclavian vein can also be cannulated by multiple approaches. The infraclavicular approach is described here (Figure 3-5). Position the patient supine and in slight Trendelenburg position. Place a rolled sheet or towel between the patient's scapulas to allow the shoulders to fall backward and flatten the clavicles. Insert the needle 1 em inferior to the clavicle, at the junction of the middle and medial thirds. Direct the needle under the clavicle and toward the suprasternal notch, with the needle parallel to the chest wall. The vein should be entered within 4 em of needle advancement. The femoral vein has a single approach. Palpate the femoral artery 2 em below the inguinal crease. The vein is usually 1 em medial to the artery at this location. Insert the needle at a 45-degree angle to the skin, medial to the femoral pulse, in a cephalad direction. In the pulseless patient, palpate the anterior superior iliac spine and the pubic tubercle. Draw an imaginary line connect\u00ad ing these 2 points. If this line is divided into thirds, the vein will be located where the medial and middle thirds intersect (Figure 3-6). Figure 3-5.

Oldeg, MD Key Points Procedural sedation is the administration of analgesic and sedative agents to induce a depressed level of consciousness so that a medical procedure can be per\u00ad formed without patient movement or memory. INDICATIONS Procedural sedation is a clinical technique that creates a decreased level of awareness, but allows maintenance of protective airway reflexes and adequate spontaneous venti\u00ad lation. The goals of procedural sedation are to provide analgesia, amnesia, and anxiolysis during a potentially painful or frightening procedure. Pharmacologic agents used in procedural sedation are of 3 general clas ses: seda\u00ad tives, analgesics, and dissociative agents. The use of such medications in the emergency setting is common and has been shown to be safe. Before the procedure, the physician should assess the patient for systemic disease and for a potential difficult airway. The patient's fitness for sedation can be quantified using the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classification sys\u00ad tem (Table 4-1). The risk of a complication from emer\u00ad gency department (ED) procedural sedation and analgesia in ASA class I and II patients is low, usually <So/o. Examples of clinical scenarios appropriate for procedural sedation include painful or anxiety-provoking situations such as joint or fracture reduction, lumbar puncture, pediatric radiologic studies, incision and drainage, or cardiover sion. CONTRAINDICATIONS Contraindications include ASA class III/IV, altered mental status, hemodynamic instability, known medication allergy, and lack of equipment or qualified personnel. Oral 13 Procedural sedation should maintain cardiorespiratory function without requiring advanced airway adjuncts. Preprocedure patient assessment and proper selection of pharmacologic agents are the keys to patient safety. Table 4-1. The American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification. I.

ASA Physical Status Classification System. http:/ jwww.asahq.org intake within 3 hours is a relative contraindication. Higher risk cases may be more safely performed with anesthesia consultation or in the operating room. EQUIPMENT Patients should be closely monitored to recognize any change in vital signs and avert complications, most notably respiratory depression. Continuous pulse oximetry, cardiac monitor, and end-tidal C02 capnography (if available) should be applied. Intravenous (IV) access, an oxygen source and delivery method (eg, nasal canula), suction, airway management equipment (ie, bag-valve-mask, supraglottic airway, laryngoscope, endotracheal tube), CHAPTER 4 resuscitation cart, and reversal drugs should be readily available. Personnel should be skilled in airway manage\u00ad ment and patient monitoring and recovery. PROCEDURE Appropriate preprocedure history includes allergies to or adverse effects from anesthetic agents, medical conditions, and time of last oral intake. Physical exam should include a thorough airway assessment to predict difficulty with bag-valve-mask ventilation or endotracheal intubation. Consider the presence of dentures, neck mobility, obes ity, and Mallampati scale (Figure 4-1). Sedation in the emer\u00ad gency department should generally be limited to ASA class I and II patients. A fasting period of 3 hours is recom\u00ad mended; however, studies have shown that a shorter period does not increase the incidence of aspiration. The urgency of the procedure often dictates acceptable preprocedure fasting period. Obtain informed consent and document the conversation in the record. Many institutions have a standardized procedural sedation record for recording consent as well as pertinent history and physical. Appropriate personnel to perform the procedure, administer medications, and monitor the patient should assemble at the bedside. The medications are administered and titrated to effect. Medication selection is guided by the type of procedure being performed (Table 4-2). Using a combina tion of a sedative/analgesic (eg, midazolam/ fentanyl) generally gives consistent clinical results. Other commonly used regimens include ketamine alone or with atropine (0.01 mg/kg IV or IM) for pediatric cases, propofol plus an analgesic (fentanyl ), or midazolam plus an analgesic. The physician should perform the procedure as a nurse or other physician monitors the patient. After completion of the procedure, the patient should be monitored until mental status returns to baseline. Discharge criteria include stable vital signs, return to baseline mental status, Class I Class II Class Ill Class IV Figure 4-1. Mallampati classification. (Reprinted with permission from Vissers RJ.

COMPLICATIONS Respiratory depression is the most common adverse reaction. Close observation of the patient's pulse oximetry and respiratory effort can alert the physician to potential airway compromise. Support respirations by positioning the airway and providing bag-valve-mask ventilations if needed. Recent data have supported the use of continuous end-tidal C02 monitoring to recognize hypoventilation before hypoxia is seen on pulse oximetry. If respiratory depression persists, consider administration of a reversal agent (Table 4-3). Nausea and vomiting is another possible side effect. Prevent aspiration and ensure the airway is clear by turning the patient, suctioning, and supporting respiratio ns. Inadequate amnesia or analgesia can make a procedure more difficult; conversely, prolonged sedation can occur with repeated doses of sedative agents. Careful Seconds 30 min Can precipitate withdrawal in chronic users medication titration and monitoring for effect can avoid these complicat ions.

Lumbar Puncture Pilar Guerrero, MD Key Points Knowledge of anatomical landmarks and proper sterile technique are important when performing a lumbar puncture (LP). Absolute contraindications to LP are skin infection over puncture site and a brain mass causing increased in tra\u00ad cranial pressure. INDICATIONS Lumbar puncture (LP) is performed in the emergency department (ED) primarily to diagnose central nervous system (CNS) infections (ie, meningitis ) and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). It may also be performed to relieve cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure and to confirm the diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (pseudo\u00ad tumor cerebri). Other indications include the diagnosis of demyelinating or inflammatory CNS processes and carci\u00ad nomatous/m etastatic disease. CONTRAINDICATIONS Absolute contraindications for performing a LP include infected skin over the puncture site, increased intracranial pressure (ICP) from any space-occupying lesion (mass, abscess), and trauma or mass to A non\u00ad contrast head computed tomography ( CT) scan should be performed to rule out an intracranial mass before per\u00ad forming an LP in the following clinical situations: altered mental status, focal neurologic deficits, signs of increased ICP (papilledema), immunocompromise, age >60 years, or recent seizure. Relative contraindications include patients who have bleeding diathesis or coagulopa thy (Table 5-1). 16 Herniation is the most serious complication of a LP, whereas post-LP headache is most common.

EQUIPMENT Most EDs have a commercially available LP kit, which con\u00ad tains a 20-gauge spinal needle, 22-and 25-gauge needles for lidocaine administration, 4 collection tubes, stopcock LUMBAR PUNCTURE .A. Figure 5-1. Lumbar puncture kit. and manometer with extension tubing, sterile drapes, skin\u00ad cleansing sponges, and lidocaine (Figure 5-1). Smaller spinal needles may be used (22, 25 gauge) and may decrease the incidence of post-LP headache; however, a 22 or larger gauge needle must be used to determine an accurate opening pressure. Other required supplies include additional 1% lidocaine without epinephrine, povidone\u00ad iodine (Betadine), and sterile gloves. PROCEDURE Lumbar puncture is an invasive procedure. Always perform a neurologic examination before LP. Explain the proce\u00ad dure, risks and benefits, and potential complications and obtain written consent. Level of iliac crests Assemble all equipment and have it within easy reach. Position the patient in a lateral decubitus position with hips and knees flexed and the upper back arched. This will allow better opening of the interlaminar spaces. Make sure the patient's shoulders, back, and hips are per\u00ad pendicular to the stretcher. Alternatively, the patient may be in a sitting position, leaning forward and resting their arms on a tray stand. The latter may work well for patients who are obese, have degenera tive joint disease, or have problems breathing. However, an accurate opening pressures can only be obtained with the patient in the lateral decubitus position. Next, identify your landmarks by palpating the top of the posterior superior iliac crests, moving your fingers medially, as if drawing an imaginary line toward the spine. This should be at the L4 interspace level. Palpate the spi\u00ad nous processes and identify the 13-14 and the 14-15 interspace. Either of these spaces can be used for the pro\u00ad cedure (Figure 5-2). Open the sterile tray and pour Betadine into the empty receptacle in the kit. Put on the sterile gloves . Draw up your lidocaine and place the collection tubes in sequential order (numbers are written on the tubes, #1-4). Connect the manometer to the stopcock. Clean the area with Betadine-soaked handheld sponges in a circular motion, from the site of planned puncture outward. Include a spinal level above and below 14. Allow the area to completely dry. Place the unfenestrated drape on the patient's bed and the fenestrated drape (with the opening) over the procedure site. Palpate landmarks again. Using the 25-gauge needle, raise a skin wheal of lidocaine over the interspace. Then, use a 20-or 22-gauge needle to anesthetize the deeper subcutaneous tissue along the approximate line that the spinal needle will pass. Aspirate before injecting to make sure you are avoiding intravas\u00ad cular administra tion. Identify your landmarks again by palpating the inter\u00ad spinous space with your nondominant hand.

Anatomy of the lumbar spinal interspaces for LP. (Reprinted with permission from Ladde JG. Chapter 169. Central Nervous System Procedures and Devices. In: Tintinalli JE, Stapczynski JS, GO, eds. Tintinolli's Emergency Medicine: A Comprehensive Study Guide. 7th ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, 2011.) needle parallel to the stretcher, slowly insert in the mid\u00ad line aiming 10 degrees cephalad. The needle will cross 3 ligaments (supraspinous, interspinous, and the strong elastic ligamentum flavum) before entering the dura and subarachnoid space (Figure 5-3). You may feel a \"pop\" as you transverse the ligamentum flavum. The bevel of the needle should be pointed to the patient's side (left or right) to prevent it from cutting the longitudinally ori\u00ad ented fibers of the dura. Theoretically, this will reduce the risk of persistent CSF leak and subsequent post-LP head\u00ad ache. After inserting the needle 4-5 em or after feeling a \"pop;' remove the stylet and look for the efflux of CSF at the base of your needle. If no fluid returns, replace the stylet and advance or withdraw the needle and recheck. You may have to withdraw the needle to the subcutane\u00ad ous tissue and redirect it more cephalad. The depth of insertion before getting into the subarachnoid space depends on the size of the patient. Never advance or remove the needle without the stylet in place to avoid it from becoming obstructed. When the subarachnoid space is entered and CSF begins to flow, assess the opening pressure. Attach the manometer to the needle and direct the lever of the 3-way stopcock away from the needle to create a communica\u00ad tion between the needle and glass column. At the point when fluid stops flowing into the manometer, the pres\u00ad sure is recorded. Normal opening pressure is between 7-18 cmHp. Deposit the CSF from the manometer into tube #1 and disconnect the manometer. In adults, pro\u00ad ceed to collect 1-2 mL of CSF per tube. More tubes may be needed for additional tests or special situations (VDRL, viral titer, Cryptococcus antigen, etc). When the fluid has been collected in all 4 tubes, the needle is removed with the stylet in place. This too has been shown to reduce the incidence of post-LP headache. The theo\u00ad retical explanation for this effect is that the stylet pushes back any pia mater that may be sticking out from the hole made in the dura. Any tissue in the dura puncture can act to keep the hole from closing and result in a persistent CSF leak. Tubes #1 and 4 should be sent for cell counts with dif\u00ad ferential. Tube #2 is sent for protein and glucose. Tube #3 should be sent for culture and Gram stain. Patients with an obese body habitus or with degenerative joints may present a challenge when performing an LP. Fluoroscopy (per\u00ad formed by a radiologist) or the use of ultrasound may aid in identifying the anatomical landmarks, making it possi\u00ad ble to perform the procedure. COMPLICATIONS A \"traumatic\" LP (from injury to the dura or arachnoid vessels) is a common occurrence, with more than 50o/o of all LP procedures having from 1 to 50 red blood cells (RBCs) in the CSF. The incidence of traumatic LP may be minimized by proper patient and needle positioning. The best method to differentiate a traumatic LP from an SAH is noting that the number of RBCs significantly decrease from tube #1 to tube #4 in a traumatic LP. Tube #4 should have close to zero RBCs. The presence of xanthochromia indicates a SAH. Spinal hematomas subdural, and subarach \u00ad noid) are rare complications ofLP, which are more likely to occur in patients with coagulation disorders. Correcting coagulation disorders (eg, Factor for a hemophiliac) is required before LP is performed. Herniation can occur when CSF is removed from a patient with increased ICP from a mass, emphasizing the importance of performing a head CT if a mass lesion is suspected. Post-LP headaches are the most common complica\u00ad tion of LP and are thought to be from continued CSF leakage through the dura at the puncture site. A post-LP headache is observed in 20-?0o/o of patients and is more common in young adults. Post-LP headaches are usually fronto-occipital and may have associated nausea, vomit\u00ad ing, and tinnitus. In most cases, the headache begins within 24-48 hours of the LP and is usually postural (worse in the upright position or with valsalva maneu\u00ad vers). Post-LP headaches usually last 1-2 days, but occa\u00ad sionally can persist up to 14 days. Treatment consists of IV fluids, caffeine (IV or oral), antiemetics, analgesics, barbiturates, diphenhydramine, and ergots. Headaches lasting >24 hours may be alleviated by an epidural blood patch performed by an anesthesiologist. If the headache does not have a postural component, lasts more than 1 week, or recurs after initially resolving, consider the LUMBAR PUNCTURE possibility of a subdural hematoma. Subdural hemato\u00ad mas are due to tearing of bridging veins from decreased CSF volume. Patients may also complain of mild backache after an LP. This is common from trauma of the spinal needle and is usually self-limited, resolving in a few days. Other poten \u00ad tial complications include iatrogenic infection caused by improper sterile technique, a contaminated field, or con\u00ad taminated needle. Infectious complications include celluli\u00ad tis, skin abscess, epidural or spinal abscess, discitis, or VanBendegom J. Lumbar puncture. In: Reichman EF, Simon RR.

New York, NY: McGraw- Hill, 2011:1178-1180. Miles S. Ellenby, Repair Jeffrey N. Siegelman , MD Key Points The timing of wound closure is determined by balancing the risk of infection with the likelihood of scarring. Identify and remove foreign bodies before wound closure. INDICATIONS Any wound deeper than a superficial abrasion should be considered for closure to improve the cosmetic result, pre\u00ad serve viable tissue, and restore tensile strength. This can be accomplished with sutures, tissue adhesive, or staples. Tissue adhesive may be indicated for hemostatic wounds in low tension areas that are at low risk for infection. Staples are appropriate for relatively linear lacerations located on the extremities, trunk, or scalp. CONTRAINDICATIONS The decision about whether and when to repair a lacera\u00ad tion is based on many factors, which can be divided broadly into host and wound factors. Host factors include age (elderly patients have 3-4 times higher rate of infection and slower wound healing), malnutrition, and immuno \u00ad comprornise ( eg, diabetes mellitus). Wound factors include timing, location, mechanism, and contamination. Bacterial counts begin to increase 3-6 hours post-injury, and every attempt is made to achieve primary wound closure as expeditiously as possible. However, there is no evidenced\u00ad based definitive time by which wounds must be closed. Wounds of the face and scalp rarely become infected (1-2%) because the face and scalp have an excellent blood supply; such wounds may be closed safely 24 hours or more after injury. Infection rates of upper ( 4o/o) and lower (7%) extremity wounds are higher, and many practitioners 20 Evert wound edges for better aesthetic outcomes. Wound irrigation and debridement prevent wound infections. use 6-12 hours as a guideline for closing these wounds. Lacerations sustained by a blunt, crushing force produce more local tissue damage and therefore have a higher rate of infection than lacerations caused by a sharp instrument (ie, knife). A puncture wound also has a high rate of infec\u00ad tion because bacteria are driven into the tissue and are difficult to remove. Visible contamination within a wound doubles the likelihood of infection. Bite wounds ( eg, dog, cat, human) have a very high rate of infection owing to bacterial colonization within the mouth. Generally, bite wounds are not closed primarily unless the wound is gap\u00ad ing or in a cosmetically sensitive area (eg, face). Staples and tissue adhesive should not be used on deep wounds that would require multiple layered closure. Tissue adhesives should not be used near mucosal surfaces, within the scalp, or over joints (without immobilizat ion), and care must be taken when used near the eyes. EQUIPMENT When preparing the wound for closure, the following are needed: povidone- iodine solution, local anesthetic ( 27-gauge needle, and a syringe. Irrigation is typically per\u00ad formed with normal saline or sterile water, a 60-mL syringe, and an irrigation shield or 18-gauge angiocatheter; however, some authors have argued that tap water iss uffi.\u00ad cient for uncomplicated wounds. Similarly, sterile gloves are typically used, although one study did not show LACERATION REPAIR Figure 6-1. Suture instruments. From left to right: needle driver, tissue forceps (pick-ups), and scissors. a decreased infection rate when sterile gloves were used compared with clean gloves in the repair of clean wounds less than 6 hours old. Instruments needed include a needle driver, tissue forceps (pick-ups), and scissors (Figure 6-1). Use the smallest monofilament suture available that will adequately appose the ends of the laceration, because thin\u00ad ner suture causes less scarring. Usually 4-0 (largest, for torso and extremities) to 6-0 (smallest, for face) will suf\u00ad fice. Antibacterial ointment, gauze, and tape are needed for aftercare. PROCEDURE Timing Wound healing occurs by primary, secondary, or tertiary intention. Primary intention is the most common method of repair and involves the approximation of wound edges soon after the injury with the use of sutures, staples, tape, or tissue adhesive. In secondary intention, the wound is cleaned but left open and allowed to heal spontaneou sly. This method is used when the risk of infection after primary closure is high. Tertiary intention (delayed primary closure) decreases infection rate in highly contaminated wounds. It is performed by cleaning and debriding contaminated wounds acutely, then suturing the wound after 3-5 days. Wound Preparation First, ensure adequate lighting and hemostasis to allow for a complete evaluation. A thorough neurovascular examina\u00ad tion is required for all wounds before administration of local anesthesia. Tendon function must also be assessed, when appropriate. Wound exploration may detect foreign bodies and diagnose injuries to deeper structures. If the depth of the wound is not easily appreciated and a foreign body is suspected (ie, patient fell on broken glass), then a plain radiograph is recommended. Glass fragments >2 mm are almost universally visualized on plain radiographs. Plastic and wood foreign bodies are not radiopaque and may require further imaging (computed tomography scan, ultrasound, or magnetic resonance imaging). Lacerations through hair-covered surfaces require fur\u00ad ther preparation before proceeding with repair. Clipping hair to 1-2 mm (but not shaving) or applying antibacterial ointment to part hair away from wound edges will allow better visualization during wound closure and decrease risk of infection. Do not remove hair from eyebrows or the hairline, as this can lead to impaired or abnormal regrowth. The edges of the wound are prepped with povidone\u00ad iodine solution. Care should be taken not to get the solution in the wound itself, as this inhibits healing. Draw up 1 o/o lidocaine into a syringe and prepare to infiltrate using a 25- or 27-gauge needle. Pain of injection can be reduced by buffering the lidocaine with bicarbonate. To do this, mix 1 mL of sodium bicarbonate with 9 mL of 1 o/o lidocaine; this solution must be used promptly. Lidocaine is infiltrated within the wound edges and around the entire wound (field block). In contaminated wounds, puncture the skin around the laceration (theoretical lower risk of infection); in clean wounds, puncture the wound edge within the wound itself (decreases pain of injection). Remember, the maximum dose of lidocaine without epinephrine is 4 mg!kg. This equates to 280 mg in a 70-kg (154 lb) man or 28 mL of 1 o/o lidocaine (10 mgfmL). Lidocaine with epinephrine has a maximum dose of 7 mg!kg. Other advantages of adding epinephrine include decreased bleeding and increased dura\u00ad tion of anesthetic. Traditional teaching dictates that caution should be used with epinephrine in end-arterial fields (eg, fingers, toes) for patients with vascular injury or a history of vascular disease; however, little evidence exists supporting this practice. Wound irrigation and debridement of devitalized tis\u00ad sues are the two most important ways to decrease the incidence of wound infection. When irrigating a wound, use a commercially available shield to avoid accidental exposure to the health care worker and create the required pressure to decrease bacterial counts. If unavailable, an 18-gauge angiocatheter with a 60-mL syringe can be used. Irrigation with a saline bag or bottle with holes punched into the top does not create enough pressure to adequately reduce bacterial counts. The amount of saline required to irrigate a wound is not known, but a basic guideline is to use 50-100 mL for each 1 em oflaceration. Wound Closure A few principles should be considered when placing simple interrupted sutures (Figure 6-2). Clamp the needle driver CHAPTER 6 ---- - Figure 6-2. Simple interrupted suture. in the middle of the needle. Grasping the end of the needle will damage the cutting edge and make suturing more difficult. Insert the needle at 90 degrees to help evert the tissue. Eversion permits more rapid epitheliali\u00ad zation than inversion and avoids a scar that is depressed after contraction. The tissue forceps are used to lift up the skin on one side of the laceration. Grasping the tissue too tightly (especially when using forceps with teeth) may damage the tissue and should be avoided. Instead use the teeth or a skin hook to lift the subcutaneous tissues. When the needle is inserted, maintain the same depth as the other side. Use 4-5 instrument ties to secure the knot. Avoid pulling the wound edges too tightly (indicated by blanching) because this may strangula te the wound edges, reducing blood supply. Begin in the middle of the wound, and then bisect the resulting segments with sub\u00ad sequent sutures until the wound is sufficiently approxi\u00ad mated. As a rule, the distance from the needle insertion to the wound edge should be the same on both sides, as well as the same depth. The distance between stitches should also be equal. On the face, this will be 1-3 mm and can be farther apart elsewhere. . Vertical and horizontal mattress sutures both pro\u00advtde excellent wound eversion and help to better approximate wound edges that are under tension and difficult to pull together (Figures 6-3 and 6-4). Vertical mattress sutures are especially useful in lacerations in which there is minimal subcutaneous tissue for deep sutures such as the hands or over joints. In addition, these sutures will help stop bleeding from a scalp lacera\u00ad tion. The disadvantage of these sutures is that they may strangulate the tissues. Figure 6-3. Vertical mattress. Deep sutures are indicated in wounds with multiple layers of tissue to close ( eg, full thickness lip lacerations) and to minimize tension on superficial skin for gaping wounds. Deep sutures should be placed with absorbable suture material. To get the knot to the depth of the wound, make the first pass of the needle from the deep portion of the wound to the superficial portion (Figure 6-5). Avoid infection by placing only enough deep sutures to effectively bring the wound edges together and cut the suture as close to the knot as possible. Staples are placed by first everting the edges of the wound and then firing the automatic stapler with the same principles of spacing as above. Tissue adhesive is applied using 4-5 layers on a hemo\u00ad static, cleaned, dry wound, which the provider approxi\u00ad mates while applying the adhesive. Avoid getting the adhesive into the wound itself. Wound tape may be applied to the wound before placing the adhesive to provide improved approximation. \\ \\ \\ .A. Figure 6-4. Horizontal mattress. \\ \\ \\ LACERATION REPAIR Figure 6-5. Deep dermal stitch. On the first pass, the needle enters at the depth of the wound so that the knot will end up at the bottom of the wound. ..... Wound Aftercare Topical antibiotic ointments provide a moist environment that assists epithelization and reduces the rate of infection. They should not be used after the use of tissue adhesive. Prophylactic oral antibiotics are recommended for heavily contaminated wounds, significant animal or human bites, areas prone to infection (mouth, plantar aspect of the foot), open fractures, tendon or joint involvement, immu\u00ad nocompromised patients, a prosthetic heart valve, or deep puncture wounds. In patients with full childhood immunizations, tetanus toxoid, given with diphtheria toxoid (Td 0.5 mL adminis\u00ad tered intramuscularly [IM) ), is administered after a minor, clean wound if the last booster was > 10 years ago. In all other wounds (contaminated, puncture, crush), tetanus toxoid is given if the last booster was >5 years ago. Tetanus immune globulin (TIG) 3,000-5,000U IM and around the wound is administered to patients with a history of <3 immunizations and a contaminated wound. Apply a topical ointment ( eg, bacitracin) and then a sterile dressing. The dressing may be removed in 24 hours and the wound can be gendy cleansed with soap and water, using caution to blot the sutures dry. Suture removal is recommended in 3-5 days for face and neck; 7-10 days for upper extremity, chest, legs, and scalp; and 10-14 days for hand, back, buttocks, foot, and overlying joints. COMPLICATIONS Complications may include infection and scarring. Despite all efforts to reduce the risk of infection, this complication can still occur. The patient should be instructed to return at the first signs of infection (ie, fever, purulent drainage, or erythema). Patients with high-risk wounds should be asked to return to their physician or the emergency depart\u00ad ment within 24-48 hours to have the wound reexamined by a physician. Patients should also be instructed that a scar will form with healing. Scarring is more significant after deeper wounds, or those that do not run parallel to natural skin lines, and when absorbable sutures are used. There are insufficient data to recommend routine use of topical healing creams such as vitamin E, aloe vera, or other commercially available products . SUGGESTED READING Desai S, Stone SC, Carter WA.

Needle and Tube Thoracostomy Ann Buchanan , MD Key Points Do not confuse a pulmonary bleb or bullae for a pneumothorax. The neurovascul ar bundle runs inferior to each rib. Always enter the thoracic cavity over the rib, never under. INDICATIONS Needle thoracostomy is indicated for emergent decom\u00ad pression of suspected tension pneumothorax. Tube thora\u00ad cotomy is indicated after needle thoracostom y, for simple pneumothorax, traumatic hemothorax, or large pleural effusions with evidence of respiratory compromise. CONTRAINDICATIONS A pneumothorax on chest x-ray may be confused with a pul\u00ad monary bleb or bullae. Bullae and blebs are large gas-filled spaces with thin walls where pulmonary parenchyma has been destroyed, therefore greatly increasing alveolar size and mimicking pneumothorax. These are frequently located in the lung apices and are often seen in patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. It is essential to con\u00ad firm the presence of a pneumothorax before placement of a thoracostomy tube. See Chapter 24 for further clinical sce\u00ad narios in which tube thoracostomy can be substituted for less invasive or conservative management of pneumothoraces. EQUIPMENT Needle thoracostomy requires a 12-to 16-gauge angiocathe\u00ad ter, 3 to 4.5 inches in length, and a 5-10 mL syringe. Tube thoracostomy requires a 36-to 40-F tube for hemothorax in adults or 20-to 24-F tube in children. For a simple pneumo\u00ad thorax, an 18-to 28-F tube in adults or 14-to 16-F tube in children is sufficient Additional supplies required for tube thoracostomy placement include povidone- iodine (Betadine) 24 Never advance or replace a tube that has migrated out of the chest.

Diagram of tube thoracostomy and 3-bottle suction apparatus. Bottle A is connected to the thoracostomy tube and collects pleural drainage for inspection and volume measurement. Bottle B acts as a simple valve to prevent collapse of the lung if tubing distal to this point is open to atmospheric pressure. Pulmonary air leak can be detected by escape of bubbles from the submerged tube. Bottle C is a system to regulate the negative pressure delivered to the pleural space. Wall suction should be regulated to maintain continuous vigorous bubbling from the middle open tube in bottle C. The resulting negative pressure in em H20 is equal to the difference in the height of the fluid levels in bottles B and C. The commercial Pleur-Evac system works in a similar manner. One end is attached to the chest tube and the other to wall suction. Each chamber of the Pleur-Evac is filled with sterile water to the level noted in the manufacturer's instructions.

CHAPTER 7 solution, sterile drapes, sterile gloves, 20 mL of 1 o/o lidocaine with epinephrine, scalpel with #10 blade, large curved and straight clamps, a needle driver, 2-0 silk suture, and a com\u00ad mercial or 3-bottle suction apparatus. PROCEDURE Needle thoracostomy is accomplished by cleansing the skin in the upper chest and inserting the catheter over needle into the second intercostal space (just over the third rib) at the midclavicular line. Tension pneumothorax is con\u00ad firmed with a sudden rush of air followed by improvement in the patient's vital signs. Tube thoracostomy placement should follow this procedure. Tube thoracostomy is performed by first positioning the patient with the arm of the affected side above the patient's head and securing it with a soft restraint. The chest wall is prepared with povidone-iodine solution and a sterile field in the area of the fourth intercostal space (below the fourth rib) at the mid to anterior axillary line. The skin is then anesthetized with lidocaine, followed by anesthesia of the deeper structures tunneling above the fifth rib. Next, inject the intercostal muscles of the fourth to fifth intercostal space, extending into the parietal pleura. Addition ally, procedural sedation or intercostal nerve blocks may be used. After adequate anesthesia, a 2-to 3-cm incision is made at the fifth rib between the mid and ante\u00ad rior axillary lines (Figure 7-1A). Using a large curved clamp, tunnel up through the soft tissues over the fifth rib to the fourth to fifth intercostal space. Then, using the same clamp, puncture through the intercostal muscles, using care not to enter the pleural space too deeply (Figure 7-1B). Open the jaws of the clamp to widen the hole in the intercostal muscles. Insert a gloved finger through the tract into the pleural cavity, using the curved clamp as a guide, and then remove the clamp. Using your finger, ensure there are no lung adhesions (Figure 7-1 C). Using your finger or the curved clamp, insert the chest tube into the thorax, directing the tube posterior and superior, ensuring that all the evacuation holes of the tube are within the thorax (Figure 7-lD). The tube is then attached to a suction device (Figure 7-2). Secure the tube by placing a simple interrupted suture inferior to the tub e. After tying a knot, the remaining suture should be wrapped around the tube several times and a second knot tied. The skin above the tube should then be closed with simple interrupted sutures. Cover the wound with Vaseline gauze and a bandage. A postprocedure chest x-ray should be ordered to check tube position and confirm lung reexpansion (Figure 7-3). COMPLICATIONS The most common complication of needle thoracostomy is failure to decompress. The patient's body habitus should dictate the size of the catheter over needle being used. If a .A. Figure 7-3. Chest x-ray showing the proper position of a chest tube in the right lung. 3-cm catheter over needle fails to reach the pleural space, the procedure should be immedia tely repeated with a 4.5-cm catheter over needle. Infection remains a serious complica tion of tube tho\u00ad racostom y for patients with chest trauma, with incidences ranging from 2o/o to 25%. Thus strict sterile technique should always be followed. Tubes should never be advanced back into the thoracic cavity if they have migrated out. A new tube should be placed. Bleeding can also complica te tube thoracostom y. It may occur from superficial venules or arterioles at the incision site or from iatrogenic injury to the lung or abdominal orga ns. Incorrect tube placement may cause kinking, subcutane\u00ad ous placement, or evacuation holes remaining outside the thoracic cavity, which results in either a nondraining tube or one with a persistent air leak. Reexpansion pulmonary edema, a rare but life-threatening complicat ion, is more common when the lung has been completely collapsed for several days. Avoid this complication by placing the tube to water seal after insertion if the lung has been col\u00ad lapsed for a prolonged period. This allows for a more gradual reexpansion.

Introduction Bailitz, MD Basem F. Khishfe, MD Key Points use of ultrasound by emergenc y physicians has grown significantly in the last decade. Emergent applications include the setting of trauma, abdominal aortic aneurysm, ectopic pregnancy, gall bladder, and kidney and as an aid to procedures (eg, intravenous access). INDICATIONS Emergency ultrasound (EUS) is preformed by emergency physicians at the patient's bedside to rapidly answer an increasing number of focused diagnostic questions, safely guide invasive procedures, and monitor the response to treatment. The 2008 American College of Emergency Physicians ultrasound guidelines describe the history and training process for the now 11 core EUS applications. EUS is most commonly used to evaluate and manage patients with the following clinical presentations: Abdominal and chest trawna. The Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) exam evaluates for blood in the pericardial, pleural, and peritoneal compartments in a rapid, reproducible, portable, and noninvasive approach. The extended FAST exam evaluates for evidence of pneumothorax. Ectopic pregnan cy. Abdominal/pelvic pain or vaginal bleeding are common presentations in the first trimester. An intrauterine pregnancy on EUS effectively rules out an ectopic pregnancy in the majority of patients. Abdominal aortic aneurysm. EUS can quickly rule out abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in patients presenting with nonspecific abdominal or low back pain, avoiding the need for a computed tomography 27 The 2008 American College of Emergency Physicians ultrasound guidelines describe the history and training process for the now 11 core applications of emergency ultrasound. (CT) scan. At the other end of the clinical spectrwn, in a hypotensive patient with abdominal or back pain, EUS may rapidly rule in the diagnosis of AAA, facilitating life-saving transp ort to the operating room instead of threatening decompensation during CT. Acute cholecystitis. Physical examination and laboratory findings are often nonspecific in acute cholecystitis. EUS often helps rule in or out the diagnosis, prompting faster intervention or disposition. Renal colic. In the uncomplicated patient with flank pain and hematuria, mild to moderate hydronephrosis often further supports the diagnosis of nephrolithiasis without the need for additional imaging. Procedural applications. Use of ultrasound to aid in performing procedures includes placement of peripheral and central lines, abscess and foreign body localization, interspace visualization for lumbar puncture, and US guidance of pericardiocentesis, thoracentesis, and paracentesis. CONTRAINDICATIONS Relative contraindications to EUS include patient factors such as obesity and excessive bowel gas, as well as physician inexperience. If the specific clinical question is not CHAPTER 8 answered or unexpected findings are encountered, then always proceed to the next test. EUS is another advanced diagnostic and procedural tool, but is not always a replace\u00ad ment for more definitive testing. EQUIPMENT US is analogous to a submarine's sonar system. Sound waves are emitted by the US probe, travel through tissue, are reflected off structures, and then return to the probe. Travel time is translated by the computer into depth within the body. Strength of returning echoes is translated into brightness or intensity of the structure on the display. Sound is a series of repeating pressure waves. Audible sound is in 16-20,000 cycle/sec or Hz range, whereas diag\u00ad nostic US uses waves in the 2-12 MHz range (mil\u00ad lion cycles/ sec). Probes send out and receive information via the piezo\u00ad electric or the pressure-e lectricity effect. The probe relies on a complex, delicate, and expensive arrangement of crystals. These crystals convert electrical energy to mechanical energy in the form of sound waves. Returning sound waves are translated back into electricity by the probe. Probe mainte\u00ad nance is of utmost importance; a probe must never be used if cracked or otherwise significantly damaged. Frequency. The higher the frequency of sound waves emitted by the probe, the greater the tissue resolution, but the lower the depth of penetration. Different types of probes exist for different clinical questions. Low-frequency probes (2-5 MHz) are used in thoracic and abdominal imaging to visualize deeper structures. High-frequency probes (8--10 MHz) are used in procedural applications, such as central line placement and nerve blocks, to visualize more superficial structures with more detailed resolution. Echogenic ity. Images are described in terms of echo\u00ad genicity. Dense bone is highly reflective, appearing bright or hyperechogenic. Less dense organ parenchyma appears grainy or echogenic. Fluid-filled structures or acute bleed\u00ad ing do not reflect, appearing black or anechogenic. Air has an irregular reflective surface and appears as bright scatter with dirty posterior shadows. Orientation. A marker on the US probe corresponds to an indicator on the screen. By accepted standard in emer\u00ad gency medicine and radiology, the indicator is always on the physician's left side of the screen. In the sagittal (longitudi\u00ad nal) anatomic plane, the probe marker is pointed at the patient's head, resulting in the head being displayed toward the left side of the screen and the feet toward the right (Figure 8-lA). In the coronal (transverse) anatomic plane, the probe marker is pointed at the patient's right, resulting in the patient's right side being displayed on the left side of the screen, similar to viewing aCT scan image (Figure 8-1B). Modes. The most commonly used mode is the bright\u00ad ness (B) mode on the US machine. Other modes include the motion (M) mode, often used to measure the fetal heartbeat, as well as the Doppler and color flow modes to measure blood flow. A 8 .A Figure 8-1. A. Longitudinal probe orientation. The probe marker points to the head of the patient. B. Transverse probe orientation. The probe marker points to the right of the patient. PROCEDURE The basic FAST examination consists of multiple ultrasound views of the abdomen and lower thorax. The patient should be in the supine position with the physician and machine on the patient's right side of the bed. Subxiphoid view. The probe is placed in the subxiphoid area with the marker in the transverse anatomic plane aimed at the patient's left scapula. Blood between the visceral and pleural pericardial layers will appear anechogenic (Figure 8-2). INTRODUCTION TO ULTRASONOGRAPHY Figure 8-2. Subxiphoid view showing a pericardia! effusion. Right upper quadrant (RUQ) view. The probe is placed in the midaxillary line in the ninth to 12th interspace with the marker to the patient's head in the coronal plane. Examine for blood in the right hemitho rax, the hepatorenal fossae (Morison's pouch), and the inferior paracolic gutter. Morison 's pouch is the most dependent portion of the abdomen above the pelvis and therefore the most common site to visualize large amounts of free intraperitoneal fluid (ie, blood) (Figure 8-3). Left upper quadrant (LUQ) view. The probe is placed in the posterior axillary line in the eighth to 11th interspace with the marker to the patient's head in the coronal plane.

Beck, DO Key Points Emergency medical services (EMS) is the extension of emergency medical care into the prehospital setting. The u.s. EMS Systems Act of 1973 established key elements for EMS systems to receive funding. INTRODUCTION Emergency medical services (EMS) is the medical specialty that involves the delivery of prehospital care. The use of the term \"EMS\" may refer solely to the prehospi tal element of care or be part of an integrated system, including the main care provider, such as a hospital. Federal funding for emergency medical services came with the U.S. EMS Systems Act of 1973, which established 15 key elements that must be addressed by systems to receive funding. The elements are used here as an outline for discussion. ..... Manpower The workforce providing prehospital care varies largely based on population density. Urban areas typically have paid providers serving through government agencies or as public safety officers in large public venues (airports, amusement parks, etc). Volunteers are more commonly found in suburban, rural, and wilderness areas. ..... Training The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) National Standard Curriculum for prehospital care providers his\u00ad torically outlined EMT\u00ad basic, EMT-intermediate, and EMT-paramedic. Currently, In 2012, the American Board of Medical Specialties approved EMS as a subspecialt y. these levels are being transitioned to 4 nationally standard\u00ad ized levels of certification: emergency medical responder (EMR), emergency medical technician (EMT), advanced EMT (AEMT), and paramedic. Each level of training infers a specific role, skill set, and knowledge base (Table 9-1). EMS provider training at all levels emphasizes airway, breathing, and circulation (ABCs) and provider scene safety as priorities in patient care. Although significant efforts have been made to standardize education and certi\u00ad fication throughout the United States, variability exists from state to state in scope of practice and specific medica\u00ad tion usage by each level of prehospital provider . ..... Communications/ Access to Care In the early 1970s, \"9-1-1\" became the now ubiquitous common point of access to emergenc y services. Call cen\u00ad ters are typically staffed by trained dispatchers who prac\u00ad tice priority dispatch ing. Their job is to gather sufficient information to triage and allocate the most appropriate resources for a given response. It is becoming increasing ly common for dispatchers to provide pre-arrival instructions to the caller, such as how to perform layperson CPR. ..... Transportation Transport vehicles vary in equipment based on the intended response model and provider scope of practice. 30 EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES Table 9-1. Prehospital care providers. Certification Level Description Emergency medical responder (EMR} The first responders to arrive on scene, they are trained to perform immediate lifesaving care with limited resources until additional EMS responders arrive. Their skill set includes CPR, spinal immobilization, oxy\u00ad gen administration, hemorrhage control, and use of an automated external defibrillator (AED}. Emergency medical technician (EMT) This is the basic level of training necessary for ambulance operations. EMTs' skill set includes that of the EMR, with the addition of transport operations and the assistance of patients in taking some of their own prescription medications, such as metered-dose inhalers or nitroglycerine tablets. They may also provide several medications including oral glucose, aspirin, albuterol, and epinephrine for anaphylaxis. Advanced emergency medical technician (AEMT} Under medical direction, the AEMT may initiate intravenous or intraosseous access, perform manual defi\u00ad brillation, interpret electrocardiograms, and admin ister an expanded range of medications. Paramedic Traditionally the highest prehospital level of training with the broadest scope of practice. Their expanded skill set includes endotracheal intubation, cricothyrotomy, needle thoracostomy. Drug administration includes vasoactive agents, benzodiazepi nes, and opiates for pain control. They are also trained to per\u00ad form higher level ECG analysis and to provide antiarrhythmic therapy with medications, electrical car dia\u00ad version, manual defibrillation, and transcutaneous pacing. Critical care paramedic This is a provider level that reflects additional training, knowledge, and scope of practice that is needed for initiating or maintaining advanced level intervention during transport. Critical care paramedics often have training in chest tube placement and manageme nt, balloon pump management, neonatal care, central venous catheters, arterial lines, and hemodynamic monitoring. Additional medications including neuromuscular blockers and sedation agents are commonly used at this level of care . Basic life support (BLS) ground units have automated external defibrillators (AED) and supplies necessary for basic wound care and airway management, including oxygen, bag- valve-masks, suction equipment, and oral and nasal airways. Advanced life support (ALS) units have equipment necessary for a paramedic's scope of practice, including equipment for IV access, medications, and a cardiac monitor/defibrilla tor for rhythm analysis and intervention. Some systems have uniquely equipped critical care transport units that are designed to accommodate patients with cont inuous IV infusions, ventilato rs, or other specialized medical equipment such as intra-aortic balloon pumps or neonatal incubators. Air medical transport comprises both fixed-wing (airplane) and rotary-wing (helicopter) vehicles. General indications for air medical transport are outlined in Table 9-2. Table 9-2. Relative indications for air medical transport. Distance by ground to the closest appropriate medical facility is too great for safe and timely transport. A delay during ground transport would likely worsen the patient's clinical condition. Specialized care is not available from local ground response agencies. An area is inaccessible to ground traffic. The use of local ground resources would leave an area temporarily without adequate resources. .,..._ Facilities/Critical Care Units In general, prehospital patients are transported to the clos\u00ad est appropriate medical facility. There are some situations in which a patient's preference may dictate hospital desti\u00ad nation. One issue that has emerged as a product of hospital overcrowding is ambulance diversion, where ambulances may need to bypass the closest appropriate facility to trans\u00ad port to another center that has capacity. Another factor in hospital destination is availability of specialty care for time-critical diagnoses. Examples of field triage and trans\u00ad port for time-critical illnesses include designated \"trauma centers;' facilities with surgical teams and operating rooms on centers;' centers;' with cardiac catheterization laboratories and therapeutic hypothermia resources readily available for patients with acute coronary syndromes or cardiac arrest. Obstetrical, pediatric, and burn centers are recognized in some regions as specially designated receiving facilities. .,..._ Public Safety Agencies Prehospital responses are often coordinated efforts between police, fire, and EMS personnel. Various paradigms for the division of labor within a given municipality exist. Some of the more common EMS structures include fire-based, third-service, private, and hospital-based. Fire-based ambulances are staffed and operated by the local fire department, whereas in third-service systems, EMS are separate from both police and fire departments. Private ambulance companies may provide nonurgent transports CHAPTER 9 or may operate under contract with local governments to supplement or provide all emergency care for a munici\u00ad pality. Lastly, hospital-based ambulances have crews of hospital-employed personnel dispatched on ambulances owned by the hospital. ..... Consumer Participation/Public Information and Education An important aspect of most EMS operations is commu\u00ad nity service, ranging from public relations expositions to educational initiatives like CPR training. It is also common for public representatives to participate in the oversight and decision making that takes place within a public EMS organization. EMS is often described as existing at the intersection of public safety and public health; EMS data and personne l are a critical link in public health infrastruc \u00ad ture and preventative interventions. ..... Patient Transfer One of the primary purposes of EMS is to deliver patients to the care that they need. In many cases, this involves transport from the scene of an injury or medical event to a receiving hospital, but it may also involve the transport of a patient from one medical facility to another. A key legis\u00ad lative mandate set forth in the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) is that an appropriate medical screening exam must be performed to identify emergent medical conditions that must be stabi\u00ad lized before a patient can be considered for transfer to another facility. Receiving hospitals must explicitly accept a transfer before a patient is transported. ..... Coordinated Patient Record Keeping Te method of charting varies from one system to another, W1th many systems now implementing an electronic medi\u00ad cal record. A significant barrier to prehospital research is the tremendous variation that exists in charting methods, data definitions, and reporting requirements. There is also difficulty linking prehospital data to hospital or outcomes data. ..... Review and Evaluation The care rendered by prehospital providers is overseen by a physician medical director. Day-to-day operations generally function using either \"standing orders\" (offline medical control-protocols developed to guide patient care) or online medical control (real-time telephone/radio commu\u00ad nication with hospital personnel to answer clinical questions or to receive orders). Protocols undergo periodic review for updates based on changing system needs and current sci\u00ad ence. Proactive systems have robust continuous quality Table 9-3. The \"Simple Triage and Rapid Treatment\" (START) system. Green (minor) Yellow (delayed) Red (immediate) Black (deceased) Care may be delayed (eg, non-limb\u00ad threatening extremity trauma) Will require urgent care (eg, hemorrhage with signs of adequate perfusion) Requires immediate care for life-threatening injury (eg, severe hemorrhage or airway compromise) Either dead or mortally wounded, such that dedication of any additional resources is unlikely to alter outcome improvement processes, by which EMS data are used to identify areas of the system in need of improvement . ..... Disaster Plan/Preparedness Emergency response plans exist at local, state, and national levels. Key features include provisions for interagency communication and agreements regarding the optimal allocation of limited resources when a system's capacity is exceeded-a situation referred to as a mass casualty inci\u00ad dent. In these situations, the \"Simple Triage and Rapid Treatment\" (START) algorithm is a commonly employed triage protocol used to assess severity of injury and to assign transport prior ity. Providers assign 1 of 4 colors to victims during an initial assessment focused on the ABCs (Table 9-3). ..... Mutual Aid Agreements among neighboring municipalities or EMS services are common to bolster the capacity of a given agency's emergency response system. Interagency commu\u00ad nication and equipment interopera bility are potential challenges that need to be addressed in establishing such relationships.

Washington, DC: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 2007. Cardiopulmonary Arrest Katherine M. Hiller, MD Key Points Cardiac disease is the most common cause of nontrau\u00ad matic death in the United States. There are more than 300,000 sudden cardiac deaths (SCD) each year in the United States. The survival rate of INTRODUCTION Cardiopulmonary arrest is defined by unconsciousness, apnea, and pulselessness. Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is associated with an underlying history of coronary artery disease (CAD), but an acute thrombotic event is causal in only 20-40% of cardiac arrests. Twenty-five percent of cardiac arrests may have a non cardiac origin ( eg, pulmo - nary embolus, respiratory arrest, drowning, overdose). The most common initial rhythm is ventricular fibrillation (VF), found in approximately 30% of patients. Asystole and pulseless electrical activity (PEA) are the next most common presenting rhythms. The risk of SCD is 4 times higher in patients with coronary artery disease risk factors and 6-10 times higher in patients with known heart disease. Structural heart disease ( eg, cardiomyop athy, of cases of SCD. Another 10% of SCD cases occur in patients with no structural heart disease or CAD. These cases are thought to originate from Brugada syndrome, commotio cordis, prolonged QT syndrome, and familial ventricular tachycardia (VT), which all cause dysrhythmias leading to SCD. Other risk factors associated with an increased risk of SCD include smoking, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, 33 sco is dependent on the length of time without a pulse, the underlying cardiac rhythm, and comorbidities. Early and uninterrupted chest compressions and early defibrillation are the keys to successful resuscitation. dyslipidernia, and a family history of cardiac disease. Moderate alcohol consumption (1-2 drinks per day) is considered protective, whereas heavy alcohol consumption (>6 drinks per day) is a risk factor for SCD. Despite advances in the field of cardiac resuscitation, the survival rate of out-of-hospital SCD is estimated to be 3-8%. Survival to discharge in out-of-hospital SCD is largely determined by the presenting rhythm. Patients with VF are 15 times more likely to survive to discharge than patients in asystole (34% vs 0-2%). CLINICAL PRESENTATION History Obtain history from paramedics, bystanders, or any avail\u00ad able family members. Inquire about medications, past medical history, allergies, trauma, and events leading up to SCD. Physical Examination Do not halt treatment (including chest compressions and bag-valve-mask ventilation) to perform a complete physi\u00ad cal exam. If the patient has an endotracheal tube in place, verify position by using end-tidal C02 capnography or capnometry. DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES Laboratory CHAPTER 10 If the patient has a return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), order a complete blood count, electrolytes, renal function, and myocardial markers (ie, troponin ). Coagulation studies, an arterial blood gas, and a lactate may also be useful. Imaging If the patient has a ROSC, obtain a chest x-ray to evaluate endotracheal tube placement and an electrocardiogram to evaluate for cardiac ischemia. PROCEDU RES Pericardiocentesis is indicated if there is a suspicion of cardiac tamponade in the setting of PEA. Bedside ultra\u00ad sound can be useful if tamponade is suspected. A long spinal needle is inserted s ubxiphoid into the pericardia! sac aimed toward the left shoulder. Pull back on a 60-mL syringe while advancing the needle until blood is obtained. A needle thoracostomy is indicated if there is a s uspi\u00ad cion of tension pneumothorax in the setting of PEA. Insert an 18-gauge needle into the second intercostals space in the midclavicular line. A needle thoracostomy must always be followed by a tube thoracostom y in patients with ROSC. MEDICAL DECISION MAKING The differential diagnosis for SCD is broad. Management of SCD depends on the presenting rhythm; however, every patient should receive continuous high-quality uninter\u00ad compressions. Defibrillate VF/pulseless VT. Administer epinephrine for asystole and PEA. Attempt to correct reversible causes of PEA, the H's, and T's (Table 10-1). Once ROSC occurs, initiate postresuscitative care, including therapeutic hypothermia, which improves neurologic outcome. Table 10-1. The H's and pneumothorax Thrombosis (pulmonary, cardiac) TREATMENT If there is a clear, written, advanced directive signed by the patient or medical power of attorney stating that resuscita\u00ad tive efforts should not be instituted, or if the resuscitation would be futile because of clear signs of irreversible death (decapitation, rigor mortis), resuscitative efforts should not be initiated or continued. The resuscitative team must orchestrate simultaneous assessment and management of patients in cardiopul mo\u00ad nary arrest. 1. Defibrillation. Indicated for patients in VF or pulseless VT. The rate of successful defibrillation when attempted within 1 minute of VT is >90o/o, but falls lOo/o with each subsequent minute. 2. Chest compressions. The carotid pulse is the most reli\u00ad able in low-flow states. If no pulse is detected, chest compressions should be initiated. Survival is greatly increased when chest compressions are performed properly (depth 1.5-2 inches, > 1 00/min) and greatly decreased when there are delays or interruptions in chest compres sions. Chest compressions should be performed continuously and should not be interrupted for ventilation. A brief rhythm check should be under\u00ad taken after every 2 minutes of chest compres sions. When defibrillation is indicated, compressions should be continued while the manual defibrillator or AED is charging. Chest compressions should only be briefly halted ( < 10 seconds) to deliver the shock and irnmedi\u00ad ately resumed after delivery. 3. Airway. The most common airway obstruction in the unconscious patient is the tongue falling back against the posterior pharynx. This can be managed immedi\u00ad ately with a jaw thrust or chin lift maneuver. Bag-valve\u00ad mask ventilation should then be used until enough providers are available to allow continued compres \u00ad sions and defibrillation while advanced airway adjuncts are assembled. Endotracheal intubation is the definitive airway management technique used for patients in car\u00ad diac arrest. Attempts at intubation should be brief so as not to hinder delivery of high-quality continuous chest compressions. 4. Pharmacologic therapy. a. Vasopressors. The current recommended dose of epinephrine is 1 mg initially, with repeated doses every 3-5 minutes. \"High-dose\" epinephrine con\u00ad fers no benefit and may be harmful. When there is no IV access, epinephrine can be given in the endotrachea l tube at a dose 2-2.5 times the IV dose. Alternati vely, vasopressin 40 units IV may be given once. b. Antidysrhythrnics. Amiodarone, 300 mg IV push, repeated as a second dose of 150 mg IV push may be useful for defibrillation refractory VT /VF. Magnesium, 2 g IV, may be useful in patients with torsade de points. CARDIOPULMONARY ARREST Patient unresponsiv e Assess airway, breathing, circulation No pulse Initiate chest compressions, while attaching monitor or defibrillator Admit for hypothermia and post\u00ad resuscitative care Asystole/PEA 2 Minute cycles of CPR intubate, IV access epinephrine 1 mg IV every 3-5 minutes Consider treating reversible causes (H's and T's) Figure Cardiac ventricular pulseless electrical activity. CHAPTER 10 5. Postresuscitation care. All patients who remain comatose with an ROSC should receive therapeutic hypothermia (33\u00b0C for 24 hours, then rewarm over 24 hours). DISPOSITION ..... Admission All patients with ROSC should be admitted to the intensive care unit or cardiac care unit for postresusci tative care as well as management of underlying conditions leading to the arrest. If CAD/acute coronary syndrome is the pre\u00ad sumed cause of SCD, all therapies, especially percutaneous coronary intervention, should be considered.

Schwab, MD Key Points Rapid-sequ ence intubation (RSI) is the preferred method for endotracheal tube placement in the emergency department. The decision to intubate should always be made on clinical grounds. Time permitting, assess for factors predictive of a difficult airway before RSI. INTRODUCTION Successful airway management depends on the prompt recognition of an inadequate airway, the identification of risk factors that may impair successful bag-valve-mask (BVM) ventilation or endotracheal tube (ETT) placement, and the use of an appropriate technique to properly secure the airway. The decision to intubate is a clinical one and should be based on the presence of any 1 of 3 major condi\u00ad tions: an inability to successfully protect one's airway against aspiration/occlusion, an inability to successfully oxygenate the blood (hypoxemia), or an inability to suc\u00ad cessfully clear the respiratory byproducts of cellular metabolism (hyperca pnia). Additional indications includ\u00ad ing the desire to decrease the work of breathing (sepsis), the need for therapeutic hyperventilation (increased intra\u00ad cranial pressure [ICP]), and the need to obtain diagnostic imaging in noncooper ative individuals (altered mental status) should be taken into account on a patient-by\u00ad patient basis. Techniques for the management of unstable airways range from basic shifts in patient positioning to invasive surgical intervention. Standard basic life support recom\u00ad mendations such as the head-tilt chin-lift maneuver may open a previously occluded airway. Oropharyngeal and nasal airway adjuncts are both simple to use and highly 37 General criteria for endotracheal intubation include a failure to protect the airway, a failure to adequately oxygenate, and a failure to expire accumulating cor Pursue alternative techniques (eg, cricothyrotomy) in patients when the initial airway intervention has failed and the patient cannot be adequately ventilated. effective in this setting, but are unfortunately often under\u00ad utilized. Failure to respond to these measures warrants the placement of an ETT. Rapid-sequence intubation (RSI) combines the careful use of pretreatment interventions with the administration of induction and paralytic agents to cre\u00ad ate the ideal environment for ETT placement and is the preferred method in the emergency department (ED). A patient who cannot be intubated within 3 attempts is considered a failed airway. This scenario occurs in -3-5% of all cases. Numerous alternative devices including laryn\u00ad geal mask airways (LMA), introducer bougies, and fiber\u00ad optic instruments have been developed to facilitate airway management in these situations. That said, these methods are not failsafe, and roughly 0.6% of patients will require a surgical airway. Emergent cricothyrotomy is the preferred surgical technique for most ED patients. CLINICAL PRESENTATION .... History The need for immediate airway intervention in emergency situations always supersedes the need for a comprehensive history and physical exam. Time permitting, perform a rapid airway assessment to identify any risk factors predic\u00ad tive of a difficult airway, inquire about any current CHAPTER 11 medication use and known drug allergies, and try to ascer\u00ad tain the immediate events leading up to ED presentation. Risk factors predictive of a difficult airway include those that impair adequate BVM ventilation and those that preclude successful placement of an ETT. Examples of the former include patients with facial trauma and distorted anatomy, obese patients with excessive cervical soft tissue, and asthmatic patents with excessively high airway resis\u00ad tances. Examples of the latter include patients with a his\u00ad tory of degenerative changes of the spine that limit cervical mobility ( eg, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis), patients with underlying head and neck cancers that dis\u00ad tort the normal cervical anatomy, and those with excessive swelling of the airway and surrounding tissues (eg, angioedem a). ..... Physical Examination Rapidly examine the airways of all critically ill patients. Always consider the presence of concurrent cervical spine injury in victims of trauma and immobilize as appropriate. Carefully examine the face, noting any signs of significant facial trauma and the presence of a beard, both of which frequently impair adequate BVM ventilation. Inspect the oropharynx, noting the presence of dentures; the size of the teeth and presence of a significant overbite; visibility of the soft palate, uvula, and tonsillar pillars (ie, Mallampati classificat ion); and the presence of significant airway swell\u00ad ing. The pooling of blood or secretions in the oropharynx indicates an inability to properly protect the airway. A good adage to remember when assessing the airway is the 3-3-2 rule. The inability to open the mouth 3 finger breaths, a distance from the tip of the chin to the base of the neck less than 3 finger breaths, or a distance between the mandibu\u00ad lar floor and the prominence of the thyroid cartilage of less than 2 finger breaths all predict more difficult ETT place\u00ad ment. Assess the range of motion of the cervical spine, provided there is no concern for occult injury. DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES ..... Laboratory Although abnormalities on either blood gas analysis (hyper\u00ad capnia) or pulse oximetry (hypoxemia) may be indicative of an inadequate airway, normal values on either of these stud\u00ad ies should not justify the delay of definitive intervention in the appropriate clinical scenario. Progressive abnormalities on serial testing (increasing PaC02, decreasing Pa02) in patients who are clinically decompensating indicates the need for airway intervention. ..... Imaging Imaging studies should not be used to predict the need for airway intervention. Obtain a chest x-ray (CXR) in all patients after intubation to confirm proper ETT placement. The tip of the ETT should be visualized approximately 2 em above the carina. Deeper insertion results in place\u00ad ment into the right mainstem bronchus. MEDICAL DECISION MAKING Consider all rapidly reversible causes of airway compromise (eg, hypoglycemia, opioid overdose) before pursuing endo\u00ad tracheal intubation. Proper intervention may transform a comatose patient with a rather tenuous airway into an awake coherent individual with adequate airway protection. Identify patients who are likely to present a difficult airway and those who require specialized approaches ( eg, head trauma precautions, hypotension, cervical spine injury) and proceed accordingly (Figure 11-1). PROCEDU RES ..... Bag-Valve-Mask Ventilation Proper BVM ventilation requires an open airway and an airtight seal between the mask and the patient's face. Use the head-tilt chin-lift technique (jaw-thrust maneuver in trauma victims) to open the airway and insert oropharyn \u00ad geal or nasal adjuncts as necessary to maintain patency. Avoid the use of oral adjuncts in patients with intact gag reflexes and nasal adjuncts in patients with significant mid-face trauma. With proper technique and a high-flow oxygen source, this method can provide an Fi02 of approximately 90% (Figure 11-2). ..... Rapid-Sequence source (eg, nonrebreather [NRB] mask) for several minutes as time permits before RSI. Avoid positive pressure ventilation (eg, BVM) to prevent insufflation of the stomach, which can increase the patient's risk for aspiration. Use this time to prepare and check your equipment. Ensure adequate N access and proper function of the suction device. Remove patient dentures, significant loose teeth, and any oral debris. Choose the appropriate size ETT. Tube sizes range in diam\u00ad eter from 2.5-9 mm. A size 7.5-or 8.0-mm tube is appro\u00ad priate for most adult female and male patients respectively. Inflate the balloon to check for leaks and insert a stylet. Uncuffed ETTs have been historically preferred in patients younger than 8 years of age as the narrowest portion of their airways lies inferior to the vocal cords at the level of the cricoid ring. That said, most practitioners now prefer cuffed ETTs for all patients. To determine the appropriate size of the ETT in pediatric patients, either use the formula Size= (Age/4) + 4 for uncuffed tubes or (Age/4) + 3 for the cuffed variety, or use a tube that is equal in diameter to the child's fifth finger . Check the light on your laryngoscope blade to ensure that it works. Laryngoscope blades range in size from 0-4 and come in 2 major varieties. The Macintosh blade is curved in shape and meant to indirectly lift the epiglottis away from the vocal cords. It is also designed with a special AIRWAY MANAGEMENT Airway management indicated: Failure to oxygenate, ventilate, or protect the airway Rapid airway evaluation to identify findings indicative of a difficult airway Difficult airway predicted No difficult airway predicted Modified approach including: \"Awake look\" intubation Difficult airway laryngeal mask airways; RSI, rapid-seque nce intubation. ridge meant to sweep the tongue to the side during insertion to improve visualization of the vocal cords. The Miller blade is straight in appearance and meant to directly lift the Figure 11-2. Proper method of BVM ventilation. epiglottis away from the vocal cords. It is of particular ben\u00ad efit in patients with very anterior airways and those with a large \"floppy\" epiglottis. A size 3 or 4 Macintosh blade is appropriate for most adult ED patients (Figure 11-3). Certain clinical scenarios warrant unique modifica \u00ad tions to standard RSI to attenuate the adverse physiologic responses to endotracheal intubation. Pretreat head injury patients with lidocaine (1.5 mg/kg) dose blocker eg, mg/kg) to limit the potential spike in ICP that may accompany ETT placement. Pretreat most pediatric patients with an anticholinergic agent ( pine 0.02 mg/kg) to prevent reflex bradycardia. Pretreat patients in whom rapid elevations in either blood pressure or heart rate would be catastrophic (eg, aortic dissection) with an opioid analgesic ( eg, fentanyl 3 meg/kg) to limit excessive catecholamine surges. Of note, the clinical utility of many of these pretreatment regimens has recently come under considerable debate. Outside of the pretreatment agents listed previously, the remaining RSI medications can be divided into either CHAPTER 11 Figure 11-3. Equipment needed for orotracheal intubation in an adult. From left to right, laryngoscope handle attached to Macintosh 3 blade, Macintosh 4 blade, Miller 4 blade, end-tidal C02 detector, 1 0-ml syringe, and endotracheal tube with stylet. induction agents or paralyzing agents. Induction agents are designed to elicit extremely rapid sedation to facilitate ETT placement. A variety of medications are available, includ\u00ad ing etomidate (0.3 these, etomidate is used most frequently in the ED because of its rapid onset and offset and relative hemodynamic neutral\u00ad ity. Avoid the use of benzodiazepines and propofol in hypotensive patients and ketamine in patients with paten\u00ad tial traumatic brain injury. Paralytic agents can be divided into depolarizing and nondepolarizing categories. Succinylcholine (1.5 mg/kg) is the lone agent in the depolarizing class and the most com\u00ad monly used paralytic for RSI because of its rapid onset and short duration of activity. Most patients achieve relaxation within 1 minute, complete paralysis by the 2-to 3-minute mark, and a return of motor function within 10 minutes. Avoid succinylcholine in patients with known hyperkale\u00ad mia and those with pathologica lly denervated tissues (eg, spinal cord injuries, itate life-threat\u00ad ening ventricular dysrhyth mias. Given for most nondepolarizing agents (eg, atracu\u00ad rium), their use is generally avoided in RSI. Certain patients predicted to have difficult airways may benefit from intubation via the use of lower than normal doses of induction agents without concurrent paralytics. Also known as the \"awake look;' this limits the all too real potential for creating the scenario of a paralyzed and, therefore, not breathing patient who cannot be intubated. Finally, apneic patients or those in cardiac arrest are not Anterior Vocal cords .6. Figure 11-4. Laryngoscopic view. (Reproduc ed with permission from Kempe CH, Silver HK, O'Brien 0, (editors): Current Pediatric Diagnosis Er Treatment. 4th ed. lange, 1976.) candidates for RSI. Their condition does not allow time for either preoxygenation or pretreatment, and being uncon\u00ad scious, they do not require RSI medications to facilitate ETT placement. Temporize these patients with BVM venti\u00ad lation pending their emergent intubation. To visualize the vocal cords, hold the laryngoscope in the left hand and carefully insert the blade into the oro\u00ad pharynx directed downward along the tongue and into the throat. Gentle upward traction should lift the epiglottis from tl1e larynx and reveal the vocal cords (Figure 11-4). Concurrent external laryngeal manipulation may shift the patient's vocal cords into better view. Keep in mind that pediatric airways are typically more anterior than those of adults and that their relatively large tongues and floppy epiglottis often necessitate the use of a Miller blade. Insert the ETT and maintain visualization until the bal\u00ad loon has clearly passed the vocal cords. Advance the ETT until the depth (at the teeth) is at 3 times the diameter of the tube. Keep in mind this is only an estimate, and all patients require a postprocedural CXR to document the depth of ETT placement. Proper insertion can be inlmediately con\u00ad firnled at the bedside by auscultating for Synlffi etric bilateral breath sounds and via the use of color-change capnography. Gentle downward pressure applied to the cricoid carti\u00ad lage (Sellick's maneuver) at the onset of induction and paralysis has been historically advocated to limit the poten\u00ad tial for aspiration. A growing body of literature has begun to question the utility of this maneuver as it not only fails to prevent aspiration but can limit adequate visualization of the vocal cords and impair successful insertion of the ETT. If cricoid pressure is applied, release inlmediately if the patient begins to vomit to prevent secondary esophageal rupture. Difficult Airway Adjuncts Multiple devices have been designed to assist with the management of difficult airways. Laryngeal mask airways AIRWAY MANAGEMENT Figure 11-5. Schematic demonstrating use of bougie. (LMA) conform to the natural curvature of the orophar\u00ad ynx and are designed for blind insertion into the supra\u00ad glottic region. Proper insertion creates an airtight seal over the larynx, allowing for mechanical ventilation. LMA insertion does not prevent aspiration, though, and is not considered a definitive airway. Introducer bougies are very useful in patients whose vocal cords cannot be adequately visualized. They are essentially long flexible rubber sty lets with a distal curve at their tip, which, when blindly inserted along the inferior margin of the epiglottis, will naturally angle upward into the larynx and through the vocal cords. Successful endotra\u00ad cheal placement can be detected as the tip of the bougie skips along the tracheal rings. The ETT is then inserted blindly over the bougie and into the airway (Figure 11-5). Cricothyrotomy is performed by making a percutane\u00ad ous incision in the cricothyroid membrane through which a tracheostomy or small ETT can be placed (Figure 11-6). This can be a life-saving intervention in the crashing patient when less invasive techniques to secure the airway have failed. Common indications include massive facial trauma and angioedema. Cricothyrotomy is contraindi \u00ad cated in children <8 years of age and should be replaced with needle cricothyrotomy.

Smith, MD Nihja 0. Gordon, MD Key Points Do not wait for hypotension to diagnose shock. Early identification and initiation of aggressive therapy can significantly improve patient survival. INTRODUCTION More than 1 million patients present to U.S. emergency departments annually with shock, and despite continued advances in critical care, mortality rates remain very high. Shock occurs when the circulatory system is no longer able to deliver enough 02 and vital nutrients to adequately meet the metabolic demands of the patient. Although initially reversible, prolonged hypoperfusion will eventually result in cellular hypoxia and the derangement of critical bio\u00ad chemical processes. From a clinical standpoint, shock can be divided into the following subtypes: hypovolemic , car\u00ad diogenic, obstructi ve, and distributive. Hypovolemic shock results from an inadequate circulating blood volume owing to either profound dehydration or significant hem\u00ad orrhage. Traumatic hypovolemia is the most common type of shock encountered in patients <40 years of age. Cardiogenic shock occurs when the heart is unable to pro\u00ad vide adequate forward blood flow secondary to impaired pump function or significant dysrhythmia. Myocardial infarction is the leading cause of cardiogenic shock and typically occurs once -40% of the myocardium is dysfunc\u00ad tional. Obstructive shock results from an extracardiac blockage of adequate venous return of blood to the heart ( eg, pericardia! tension pneumothorax, and massive pulmonary embolism [PE)). Finally, distributive shock occurs secondary to an uncontrolled loss of vascular tone (eg, sepsis, anaphylaxis, neurogenic shock, and adrenal 42 Initiate early goal-directed therapy in patients with septic shock. Early revascularization is key to improving outcome in patients with cardiogenic shock. crisis). Neurogenic shock most commonly occurs in trauma patients with high cervical cord injuries and a secondary loss of sympathetic tone and should always be considered a diagnosis of exclusion. Classically these patients will present with hypotension and a paradoxical bradycardia. Suspect septic shock in elderly, irnmunocom\u00ad promised, and debilitated patients who are toxic appearing despite only vague symptoms. The prognosis for patients with cardiogenic and septic shock remains grave, with mortality rates between 30% and 90%. The pathophysiology of shock can be divided into 3 basic categories: a systemic autonomic response, end\u00ad organ cellular hypoxia, and the secretion of proinflamma\u00ad tory mediators. The autonomic system initially responds to widespread tissue hypoperfusion by globally increasing the overall cardiac output. As tissue perfusion continues to decline, the body shunts circulating blood away from less vital structures including the skin, muscles, kidneys, and splanchnic beds. Reflexively, the kidneys activate the renin-angiotensin axis, prompting the release of various vasoactive substances, with the net effect to preserve per\u00ad fusion to the most critical organs, namely the brain and the heart. When the preceding response is inadequate despite maximal tissue 02 extraction, cellular hypoxia forces a con\u00ad version from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism. By nature, anaerobic metabolism cannot produce enough adenosine triphosphate to maintain regular cellular function. Tissue lactate accumulates, resulting in systemic acidosis, and eventually this breakdown in cellular metabolism leads to widespread tissue death. Injured and dying cells prompt the production and secretion of harmful inflammatory mediators, resulting in the development of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome, defined by the presence of fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, and leukocyto sis. CLINICAL PRESENTATION History Vague complaints such as fatigue and malaise may be the only presenting symptoms, especially in elderly patients. Friends, family, and emergency medical service personnel will be vital in obtaining a history in patients with altered mental status. The past medical history including a list of active medications might reveal risk factors such as immu\u00ad nosuppression, underlying cardiac disease, and potential allergic reactions. Physical Examination Although hypotension and tachycardia are the cardinal features of shock, many patients will presents with normal vital signs owing to physiologic compensation. Because of the unmet metabolic demands of the central nervous sys\u00ad tern, altered mental status is not uncommon. Jugular venous distention, cardiac murmurs, and pulmonary rales often accompany cardiogenic shock. A careful skin exami\u00ad nation can be invaluable, as patients in distributive shock frequently exhibit warm hyperemic extremities, whereas those in cardiogenic, hypovolemic, and obstructive shock will present with cool mottled extremities secondary to profound systemic vasoconstriction. Furthermore, abnor\u00ad mal findings such as diffuse urticaria, pronounced ery\u00ad thema, or widespread purpura may help identify the type and source of shock. The abdominal exam should focus on careful palpation and looking for signs of peritonitis or a pulsatile mass. Measure urine output, as low volumes indi\u00ad cate an absolute or relative volume deficiency and may help guide resuscitation. DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES Laboratory No single laboratory test is diagnostic of shock. Complete blood count testing may reveal an elevated, normal, or low white blood cell (WBC) count. No matter the abso\u00ad lute WBC count, a >10% Comprehen sive metabolic panel anal\u00ad ysis will assess both kidney and liver function and acid\u00ad base status. An elevated anion gap may indicate underlying lactic acidosis, uremia, or toxic ingestion. Blood gas analysis is useful to determine the serum pH, lactate level, and base deficit. Serum lactate is a highly sensitive marker for tissue hypoperfusion and predictive of overall SHOCK mortality in septic shock. Lactate levels >4 rnmol!L are significant and indicate ongoing cellular hypoxia. Other tests useful in the appropriate clinical scenario include cardiac markers, urinalyses, coagulation profiles, toxico\u00ad logic screens, and pregnanc y testing. Obtain blood and urine cultures (and possibly cerebrospinal fluid) if sepsis is a concern. Imaging No single radiologic test is diagnostic of shock. Chest x-ray may reveal evidence of an infiltrate (sepsis), enlarged cardiac silhouette (cardiac tamponade), subdia\u00ad phragmatic free or pneumothorax. Bedside ultrasound can guide the work-up, treatment, and disposition of patients in shock in multiple clinical situations including sepsis, blunt abdomina l trauma, pregnancy, abdominal aortic Furthermore, ultrasonographic guide appropriate fluid resuscitation. Computed tomography imaging has become the modality of choice for diagnosing PE, aortic dissection, and intra-abdomina l pathology . PROCEDURES Endotrachea l intubation may be required in patients with profound shock to reduce the work of breathing and sys\u00ad temic metabolic demands. Central venous line placement can expedite fluid or blood product infusion, vasopres\u00ad sor administration, and central venous pressure (CVP) analysis. MEDICAL DECISION MAKING Once shock is recognized, rapidly attempt to identify both the subtype and inciting factor to determine the approp ri\u00ad ate therapy (Table 12-1). Time is truly of the essence in these patients, and any delay will significantly impact patient outcome. Concurrent ly address the patient airway, breathing, and circulation (ABCs) and stabilize all severely ill patients. Use the ancillary laboratory and imaging stud\u00ad ies mentioned previously to guide the diagnosis and treat\u00ad ment (Figure 12-1). Table 12-1. SHOCK: differential diagnosis.

Figure 12-1. Shock diagnostic algorithm. ACLS, advanc ed cardiac PE, pulmonary embolism; PTX, pneumothorax. TREATMENT The goal of treatment is 2-fold, namely to restore normal cellular function and reverse the inciting factor. Place all patients on supplemental 02 and consider early mechanical ventilation in those with markedly elevated metabolic demands, as hyperactive respiratory muscles can steal away up to 50% of normal cerebral blood flow. Place a minimum of 2 large-bore peripheral N lines in all patients and con \u00ad sider central line placement in those who will require mul\u00ad tiple infusions, vasopressor support, or CVP monitoring. Administer boluses normal saline to replenish an absolute or relative vascular depletion. Transfuse red blood cells as needed to augment circulating 02 delivery. Initiate vasopres\u00ad sor support in patients who either fail to respond or have a contraindication ( eg, cardiogenic shock) to repeated fluid boluses. Place a Foley catheter to accurately measure urine output. The management of specific types of shock is dis\u00ad cussed next. Hypovolemic Shock Restore adequate tissue perfusion by rapidly expanding the intravascular volume. Infuse several liters of normal saline followed by several units of packed red blood cells in hem\u00ad orrhagic patients who fail to respond. Patients with simple dehydration will improve rapidly. Of note, avoid overly aggressive volume expansion in trauma patients, as this may trigger recurrent hemorrhage at previously clotted sites. Titrate therapy in these patients to a goal mean arte\u00ad rial pressure (MAP) of 60 mmHg and restoration of nor\u00ad mal mental status. Distributive Shock Sepsis Begin early goal-directed therapy in all patients with septic shock. Monitor the CVP to guide fluid resuscitation in these patients. Begin treatment by aggressively bolusing several liters of normal saline to achieve a goal CVP between 8 and 12 mmHg. Initiate vasopressor support with a norepineph\u00ad rine infusion in patients who remain hypotensive and titrate to a goal MAP >65 mmHg. Start broad-spectrum antibiotics targeted at the proposed source and pursues ur\u00ad gical drainage/debridement when indicated. Neurogenic Shock Address all other potential causes of shock first, as neuro\u00ad genic shock is a diagnosis of exclusion. Aggressively expand the circulating blood volume by bolusing several liters of normal saline. Initiate a dopamin e infusion for vasopressor support in all patients who fail to respond. Use small doses ofN atropine (eg, 0.5 mg) to treat symptomatic bradycar\u00ad dia refractive to the previously mentioned measures. Anaphylaxis Anaphylactic shock can be rapidly fatal and requires immediate treatment. Administer normal saline boluses, N antihistamines, and N corticosteroids to all intramuscular epinephrine (1:1,000 solution) in 0.3- to 0.5-mg doses as needed to maintain systemic perfusion . In patients refractive to the preceding, administer 0.3-to 0.5-mg doses of N epinephrine (1:10,000 solution) over a 2- to 3-minute duration. Actively search for and remove any ongoing allergen exposure ( eg, retained soft tissue bee stinger). SHOCK Obstructive Shock Cardiac Tamponade Administer 1-2 L of normal saline followed by emergent bedside pericardiocentesis. Perform an emergency department thoracotomy in patients with penetrating thoracic trauma who fail to respond. Pulmonary Embolism Administer small boluses of normal saline (250-500 mL) followed by vasopressor support in unstable patients. Fibrinolysis is the treatment of choice for massive PE pre\u00ad <90 despite supplemental 02), or cardiac arrest. Tension Pneumothorax Administer 1-2 L of normal saline while performing emergent needle thoracostom y followed by chest tube placement. Cardiogenic Shock The goal of treatment is to improve cardiac output while at the same time reducing myocardial workload. Administer IV fluids judiciously to avoid undesired eleva\u00ad in edema. vasopressor support patients who remain hypotensive despite IV fluids . First\u00ad line therapy is often a combination of dopamine and dobutamine (as dobutamine monotherapywill exacerbate hypotensi on), with norepinephrine reserved for patients who fail to respond. Of note, all of the aforementio ned modalities are temporizing measures pending definitive revascularization (ie, percutaneous coronary intervention or fibrinolysis ).

A rapid electrocardiogram and chest x-ray will help distin\u00ad guish between multiple emergent causes of chest pain. INTRODUCTION Chest pain is one of the most common presenting com\u00ad plaints in the emergency department (ED). As several fatal onditions present with chest pain, it is imperative to rap\u00ad Idly and thoroughly evaluate these patients to distinguish between emergent and nonemergent causes. Approach chest pain with a broad differential diagnosis and utilize your history, physical exam, and ancillary testing to narrow down the etiology. The pathophysiology of chest pain will vary tremen\u00ad dously depending on the specific etiology. Regardless of the source, pain sensation ultimately occurs owing to stimulation of either visceral or somatic nerve fibers. Somatic nerve fibers innervate the skin and parietal pleura. Patients will typically complain of a pain that is sharp in nature and easily localized. Potential etiologies include pulmonary embolism, pneumothora x, musculo skeletal injury, herpes zoster infection, pneumonia, and pleurisy. Conversely, visceral nerve pain is often vague in quality, poorly localized, and will frequently radiate to nearby structures. Patients may deny the actual sensation of\"pain\" and rather describe their condition as a heaviness, pres\u00ad sure, or simple discomfort. Potential etiologies include acute coronary syndrome (ACS), aortic dissection, gastro\u00ad esophageal reflux, and pericarditis. 46 The exclusion of life-threatening sources of chest pain should be the emergency physician's chief diagnostic concern. CLINICAL PRESENTATION History A detailed history is essential when evaluating patients with chest pain, as no single element in isolation is sensi\u00ad tive or specific enough to determine either the etiology or the severity of the complaint. Ascertain the character of the pain to help determine a somatic or visceral source. For example, a sharp and stabbing pain is less likely in patients with ACS, but rather common in patients with pulmona ry embolism. Identify the exact location of the pain and whether there is any associated radiation. Prototypical ischemic chest pain presents either just beneath the ster\u00ad num or on the left side and radiates to either the left arm or jaw, whereas a mid-thoracic \"tearing type\" pain radiat\u00ad ing straight through to the back is classically associated with aortic dissection. Determine the severity and duration of the pain. A mild, sharp pain lasting only seconds in duration is rarely associated with a serious pathology, whereas pain lasting greater than 10 minutes may suggest a more serious etiology. Recurrent pain that lasts for many hours or days per episode is unlikely to be cardiac. In patients with a known history of heart disease, ascer\u00ad tain whether or not their symptoms mirror prior presenta \u00ad tions. Patients with pain that is either similar to or more severe than a previous myocardial infarction (MI) have a markedly increased likelihood of ACS. Identify exacerbat\u00ad ing or relieving factors, as this can quickly impact manage \u00ad ment. Patients with potential cardiac presentations frequently complain of pain that is worse with exertion and improved with rest. Pain that is worse with cough or deep inspiration (pleuritic pain) is typically associated with either pleurisy, a musculo skeletal etiology, or pulmo\u00ad nary embolism. Epigastric pain that is worse with meals usually signifies a gastrointestinal etiology. Pain that is aggravated by emotional stress may point to an underlying psychiatric etiology. Finally, inquire about any associated symptoms. For example, nausea and diaphoresis have been associated with a higher likelihood for ACS. Unfortunately, the long-term risk factors for underlying heart disease (high cholesterol, smoking, hyperten sion, dia\u00ad betes, family history) have not been shown to help in the differentiation of acute chest pain patients in the ED. None\u00ad theless, this history should be taken. A history of an underly\u00ad ing hypercoagulable state ( eg, pregnancy, malignancy) should alert you to a possible pulmonary embolism (PE), whereas a history of an underlying connective tissue disorder ( eg, Marfan syndrome) should prompt an evaluation for aortic dissection. Ask about any illicit drug habits, as cocaine use has been associated with accelerated atherosclerosis, acute MI, and aortic dissection. Physical Examination Note the general appearance of the patient. Those with ACS or other serious etiologies may be clutching their chest and frequently appear anxious, pale, and diaphoretic. This \"sick vs not sick\" mentality will guide the rapidity of your examination. As with all emergency patients, assess the vital signs and ensure adequate airway, breathing, and circulation (ABCs). Note abnormal vital signs to help guide your differential diagnosis. A detailed examination of the heart, lungs, abdomen, extremities, and neurologic systems will ensure that no emergent causes of chest pain are overlooked. Listed next are some emergent presenta \u00ad tions matched with potential physical exam findings. ACS. Vital signs will vary widely depending on the re\u00ad gion of ischemia or infarction. For example, an inferior wall MI may present with bradycardia and hypotension owing to increased vagal tone. Murmurs and abnormal heart sounds such as an S3 or S4 may be present. Inspira\u00ad tory crackles on 1 ung exam are consistent with secondary pulmonary edema. Tension pneumothorax. Look for the classic signs of decreased breath sounds, tracheal deviation, and res pi\u00ad ratory distress. Consider spontaneous pneumothorax in young, thin patients with an acute onset of chest pain and shortness of breath. Pericardia! tamponade. Although usually limited to patients in extremis, patients may exhibit the classic signs of Beck's triad (hypotension, diminished heart CHEST PAIN sounds, distension). Pulsus para\u00ad doxus > 10 mmHg has shown a high sensitivity but low specificity for tamponade, as any condition causing in\u00ad creased intrathoracic pressure may demonstrate this. Pulmonary embolism. Dyspnea is the most common complaint of patients with PE. They may also describe a pleuritic-type chest pain, especially those with segmental PEs that cause secondary infarction of the parietal pleura. Patients with significantly large (massive or submassive) PE are generally ill-appearing and hemodynamically un\u00ad stable owing to the sudden severe increase in pulmonary vascular resistance. A detailed examination of the heart and lungs may reveal rales, gallops, or a prominent P2. Lower extremity exam may reveal unilateral swelling con\u00ad sistent with a deep venous thrombosis. Aortic dissection. The pain is often most severe at onset and typically extends above and below the diaphragm. These patients are often hypertensive and may have a pulse deficit in either the radial and/or femoral arteries. A marked discrepancy in blood pressure compared be\u00ad tween each arm (>20 mmHg) is highly suggestive. DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES Perform an electrocardiogram (ECG) within 10 minutes of presentation for all patients who complain of chest pain or have signs and symptoms concerning for ACS. Obtain cardiac markers including a troponin assay\u00b1 CK-MB analysis in all patients with suspected ACS. D-dimer can aid the evaluation of low-risk patients in whom PE is a diagnostic possibility. CXR should be ordered on most patients in the ED with chest pain. Posteroanterior and lateral views are ideal, but a portable anteroposterior view is sufficient for patients who require continuous cardiac monitoring. Acute aortic dissec\u00ad tion may present with a widened mediastinum or abnormal aortic contour. Pneumothoraces and a left-sided pleural effusion (owing to the relative thinness of the left esophageal wall) is seen with esophageal rupture (Boerhaave syndrome). Newer generation CT angiography is the modality embolism and aortic dissec\u00ad tion and may have an evolving role in the evaluation of patients with potential coronary artery disease. Transthoracic echo is often readily available and clini\u00ad cally useful to evaluate physiolo gy, ventricular hypokinesis in patients with ACS, and right ventricular strain in patients with massive PE. A bedside transesophageal echo is very sensitive for diagnosing acute aortic dissection in patients who are not candidates for CT angiogra phy. MEDICAL DECISION MAKING A detailed history and physical exam in combination with an ECG and/or chest radiograph may provide sufficient evidence to exclude a myriad of emergent conditio ns. CHAPTER 13 Patient presenting with chest pain Rapidly address ABC's, IV access, supplemental 02 and cardiac monitor Immediate ECG and CXR Absent breath sounds with shock Pain radiates to the back with wide mediastinum on CXR ECG with CXR Hypotension, JVD, muffled heart tones .&. Figure 13-1. Chest pain diagnostic algorithm. BMP, basic metabolic panel; distention. When this is not adequate, a thoughtful use of laboratory studies combined with the pretest probability of disease will guide decision making (Figure 13-1). TREATMENT Acute Coronary Syndrome Provide supplemental 0 2, administer a loading dose aspirin (162-365 mg), and begin sublingual nitroglycerin (0.4 mg every 5 minutes) on all ACS patients without known contrain\u00ad dications therapy will differ by institution and cardiolo\u00ad gist. Of note, the preceding interventions are often only temporizing measures, as early revascularization is definitive, especially in those patients presenting with an ST -elevation MI. Aortic Dissection Patients with an aortic dissection require an immediate and aggressive reduction in both heart rate and blood pres\u00ad sure. The goal of treatment is to maintain a heart rate <60 bpm and systolic blood pressure <100 mmHg. There are multiple medication options for this purpose, and often concurrent infusions are required to meet the pre \u00ad ceding targets. When utilizing dual therapy, it is of utmost importance to control the heart rate before dropping the blood pressure to avoid a \"reflex tachycardia\" and conse\u00ad quent expansion of the underlying dissection. Pulmonary Embolism Treatment will vary based on the hemodynamic impact of the embolism. Anticoagulate stable patients with either cular-weight or unfractionated Hemo\u00ad dynamic use of thrombolytic therapy. ..... Boerhaave Syndrome Esophageal rupture is uncommon and classically presents with the sudden onset of chest pain after vomiting. Initiate broad-sp ectrum antibiotic coverage while arranging for definitive surgical repair. ..... Pneumothorax Place all patients with a pneumothorax on supplemental 02 via a nonrebreather mask. Those with a tension pneumo \u00ad thorax require immediate needle decompression followed by chest tube thoracostomy. Simple pneumothoraces can be treated with tube thoracostomy or simple observation. ..... Pericardia! Tamponade The recognition of tamponade is much easier in the age of bedside ultrasonog raphy. Perform immediate pericardio \u00ad centesis in unstable patients arranging for an opera\u00ad tive pericardia! window via cardiothoracic surgery. DISPOSITION ...,_Admission Admit all patients with concerning presentations to a monitored bed. The following chapters discuss the CHEST PAIN disposition of patients with specific conditions m greater detail. ..... Discharge Many patients with chest pain can be discharged with close primary care follow-up and a list of strict indications for reevaluati on. Take care to exclude emergent causes and discharge only those cases with a clear nonemergent etiol\u00ad ogy (eg, chest wall pain, zoster, dyspepsia). If clinical doubt exists, it is certainly prudent to err on the side of caution and admit for inpatient observation. SUGGESTED READING Anderson JL, Adams CD, Antman EM, et al.

Acute Coronary Syndromes Christopher Ross, MD Key Points Consider acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in the initial assessment of all patients presenting with chest pain and/or difficulty breathing. Atypical presentations are common, especially in women, the elderly, and diabetics. Obtain an emergent electrocardiogram in all patients with concern for ACS to rapidly identify INTRODUCTION Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) encompasses a spectrum of disease that includes unstable angina (UA), non\u00ad (STEM!). The distinction between the 3 is based on historical factors, electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis, and cardiac biomarker measurements. ACS is the leading cause of mortality in the industrialized world and accounts for more than 25o/o of all deaths in the United States. More than 5 million patients per year present to U.S. emergency departments with symptoms concerni ng for ACS, although fewer than lOo/o will be diagnosed with acute myocardial infarctions (AMI). That said, between 2o/o and 4o/o of all patients with ACS are initially misdiagn osed and improperly discharged from the ED, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality and accounting for the leading source of malpractice payouts in the United States. The pathophysiology of myocardial ischemia can be broken down into a simple imbalance in the supply and demand of coronary perfusion. Atherosclerosis is respon\u00ad sible for almost all cases of ACS. This insidious process begins with the deposition of fatty streaks in the coronary 50 ST-segment elevation myocardial infarctions (STEM I). Patients with STEMI require immediate reperfusion therapy with either thromboly tics or percutaneous coronary intervention to salvage the maximum amount of viable myocardium. arteries of adolescent patients and progresses by early adulthood to the formation of organized fibro-fatty plaques. As plaques enlarge throughout adulthood, they progressi vely limit coronary blood flow and may eventu\u00ad ally induce the development of anginal symptoms with exertion. In time, plaques can rupture, causing secondary intraluminal thrombus formation and a sudden reduction in coronary perfusion (ie, AMI). UA is a clinical diagn osis that has no pathognomonic ECG findings or confirmatory elevations in cardiac bio\u00ad markers. Patients with classic anginal symptoms that are either new, accelerating in frequency or severity, or that occur without exertion are considered to have UA. UA and NSTEMI are very similar from a pathophysiologic stand\u00ad point with the latter being distinguished by the presence of elevated cardiac biomarkers. Both conditions arise from the non-complete occlusion of coronary blood flow with the secondary development of ischemia and infarction, respectively. Complete occlusions of the coronary arteries typically result in transmural infarctions of the myocar\u00ad dium with associated ST segment elevation (STEM!) on the ECG and increased biomarker levels. Of note, the mor\u00ad tality rates of patients with NSTEMI and STEM! are tical at the 6-month follow-up point. ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROMES It is very important to understand the basic anatomy of the coronary arteries to identify concerning ECG patterns and predict clinical complications. The left coronary artery (ie, left mainstem artery) arises from the aortic root and branches almost immedia tely into the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and left circumflex artery (LCX). The LAD runs down the anterior aspect of the heart and provides the main blood supply to the anterior left ventri\u00ad de and ventricular septum, whereas the LCX runs in the atrioventricular (AV) sulcus between the left atrium and left ventricle and provides blood to the lateral and poste\u00ad rior regions of the heart. The right coronary artery (RCA) also arises directly from the aortic root. It runs in the AV sulcus between the right atrium and right ventricle and provides blood to the right side of the heart and inferior portion of the left ventricle. The sinoatrial node is perfused by the RCA, whereas the AV node is perfused by a combi\u00ad nation of the RCA and LAD in most patients. Risk factors predictive of underlying coronary artery dis\u00ad ease (CAD) have been identified and include age >40 years, male patients or postmenopausal females, hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, smoking, family history of CAD, truncal obesity, and a sedentary lifestyle. It is impor\u00ad tant to remember that these risk factors are based on large demographic analyses and cannot be used to predict the presence or absence of CAD in a given patient. Approx\u00ad imately half of all patients presenting with ACS have no identifiable risk factors outside of age and sex. CLINICAL PRESENTATION History A thorough history is the most sensitive tool for the detec\u00ad tion of ACS, and an experienced clinician will always be wary of its variable presentation. Chest pain is the most common presenting complaint. Myocardial ischemia is classically described as pressure-like or squeezing sensation located in the retrosternal area or left side of the chest. Inquire about the quality, duration, frequency, and in ten\u00ad sity of the pain. Determine whether there is radiation of pain, associated symptoms, and provoking and palliating factors. Symptoms commonly associated with myocardial ischemia include nausea, diaphoresis, shortness of breath, and palpitatio ns. Anginal pain can radiate in almost any direction depending on the individual patient and the affected region of the heart, but radiation to the shoulder, arm, neck, and jaw is most common. It should be noted that the intensity of pain is not predictive of the overall severity of the myocardial insult, and even minimal symp\u00ad toms can correlate with significant mortality. Up to a third of patients with ACS will present with symptoms other than chest pain. Also known as \"anginal equivalents;' these presentations further complicate the accurate diagnosis of ACS. Possible complaints include dyspnea, vomiting, altered mental status, abdominal pain, and syncope. Patients at an increased risk of atypical pre\u00ad sentations include the elderly, women, diabetics, polysub\u00ad stance abusers, psychiatric patients, and nonwhite minorities. These patients have a near 4-fold increase in mortality owing to inherent delays in their diagnosis, treat\u00ad ment, and disposition. Always obtain a detailed social his\u00ad tory and inquire about any recent and chronic substance abuse. Habitual tobacco use has been proven to be an independent risk factor for CAD, whereas cocaine use can not only induce significant coronary spasm in the acute setting, but also accelerate the atherosclerotic process when chronically abused. Physical Examination There are no physical findings specific for ACS, and the exam is frequently normal. Obtain a complete set of vital signs and closely monitor unstable patients. Bradycardia is common with inferior wall ischemia owing to an increase in vagal tone, whereas tachycardia may represent compen\u00ad sation for a reduction in stroke volume. Concurrent hyper\u00ad tension increases the myocardial 02 demand and may exacerbate the underlying ischemia, whereas acute cardio\u00ad genic shock has an extremely poor prognosis. Carefully auscultate the heart for any abnormal sounds. Acute changes in ventricular compliance may result in an S3, S4, or paradoxically split S2. The presence of a new systolic murmur may signify either papillary muscle septal infarction with secondary perforation. Look for signs of acute congestive heart failure (CHF), jugular venous distension, hepatojugular reflux, and inspi\u00ad ratory crackles. Perform a rectal exam to look for evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding, and document a thorough neurologic exam in patients who may require treatment with anticoagulant or thrombolytic medications. DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES Electrocardiogram Obtain a 12-lead ECG immediately on presentation for patients with symptoms concerning for ACS. The emer\u00ad gent identification of a STEM! ensures that definitive therapy can be arranged as quickly as possible to limit further myocardial loss. The use of prehospital ECG analy\u00ad sis has further reduced any delays in appropriate therapy. Keep in mind that a single ECG provides only an isolated snapshot of myocardial electrical activity, and as such, any changes in clinical status should prompt repeat testing. In addition, fewer than half of all AMis are of the STEM! variety, and ECG interpretation may be completely normal in the setting of NSTEMI or UA. ST-segment elevations suggest the presence of an acute transmural infarction, whereas ST-segment depressions suggest active myocardial ischemia. The morpholog y of the ST-segment elevations CHAPTER 14 Table 14-1. Anatomical regions of the heart by ECG analysis. Anatomic occluded Ischemic Reciprocal Location Artery Leads Leads Anterior wall LAD V2, V3, V4 II, Ill, V1, RCA V4R is typically straight or convex upward (\"tomb\u00ad stone\") in appearance, whereas concave ST- segment eleva\u00ad tions generally indicate a more benign (left y, benign early repolarization, peri\u00ad carditis). Concerning ST-segment changes with ACS, whether elevations or depressions, should be seen in a distinct anatomical region with corresponding reciprocal changes (Table 14-1). Additional findings concerning for cardiac ischemia include inverted and hyperacute T-waves (wide-based asymmetric high-amplitude T-waves). Q waves indicative of myocardial necrosis generally appear late in the course of patients with ACS and cannot be relied on in the acute decision-making process. The ECG analysis for ACS should always occur in a stan\u00ad dard fashion based on the anatomic distribution of the coro\u00ad nary arteries (Figures 14-1 and 14-2). Of particular interest, inferior wall AMis generally represent occlusion of the RCA. ST-segment elevation that is more pronounced in lead III versus lead II is a subtle clue for involvement of the right ventricle (RV). Obtain a right-sided ECG (lead V4r, analo\u00ad gous to lead V 4 but placed on the right side of the sternum) in these patients to better evaluate the RV, and use nitroglyc\u00ad erin very carefully to avoid precipitating hemodynamic col\u00ad lapse. Furthermore, as the posterior descending arteries (PDA) of most patients arise directly from the RCA, acute occlu\u00ad sion of the RCA should raise concern for a concurrent pos\u00ad terior wall infarction. Findings on the ECG suggestive of wall infarction include an ST-segment depressions upright T-waves Figure 14-1. wall myocardial infarction. This patient had a 100% occlusion of the left anterior descending artery . .AFigure 14-2. Inferior wall myocardial infarction. Note the ST segment elevations in leads II, Ill, and aVF. Elevation in lead Ill is more pronounced than lead II, suggesting right ventricular wall involvement. ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROMES in leads V1-V4. Obtain a posterior ECG (leads V8 and V9) in these patients. Observe patients closely for the development of any form of irritability, dysrhythmia, conduction delay, or heart block (See Chapter 15 for further details). High\u00ad degree AV block (second or third degree) is present in 6% of patients with AMI. The incidence is higher in patients with inferior wall infarctions (lSo/o) owing to the second\u00ad ary increase in vagal tone or ischemia of the AV node. Anterior wall infarctions can also produce AV blocks as a result of ischemia of either the bundle of His or bilateral bundle branches, resulting in a wide QRS complex brady\u00ad dysrhythmia. The presence of a new left bundle branch block in the appropriate clinical context should be consid\u00ad ered and treated analogous to a STEMI. ..... Laboratory Injury to myocardial tissue results in the release of unique cardiac enzymes into the vascular space, which can be readily measured via serum analysis. Keep in mind that patients with ECG findings consistent with STEMI do not require confirmatory testing with serum markers but rather warrant immediate reperfusion therapy. That said, serum markers are very useful in patients with nondiag\u00ad nostic ECGs to diagnose the presence of a NSTEMl. Of note, there is no single cardiac marker analysis that has sufficient accuracy to reliably identify or exclude AMI within the first 6 hours of symptoms onset. Furthermore, elevations can and do occur secondary to non-ACS-related conditions, including myocarditis, decompensated CHF, and acute pulmona ry embolism. The usual laboratory studies used for the diagnosis of AMI are the troponins (both T and I subtypes). Troponin (Tn) levels are the most specific marker for myocardial necrosis and have become the gold standard for diagnosis. Elevated levels can be detected within 3 hours of injury, peak at 12 hours, and remain elevated for a period of 3-10 days. The degree of myocardial damage and mortality is correlated with the degree of troponin elevation. Creatinine kinase is found in all forms of muscle tissue, but the MB subunit is far more specific for myocardial injury. CK-MB elevations can usually be detected within 4-6 hours after symptom onset, peak at 24 hours, and typically return to normal within 2-3 days. Myoglobin assays are also in common use for the evaluation of AMI. Although attractive in theory as significant elevations can be detected within 1-2 hours of symptom onset, a poor specificity limits the clinical utility of serum myoglo\u00ad bin analysis. ..... Imaging Obtain an emergent chest x-ray in all patients who pres\u00ad ent with a chief complaint of chest pain or shortness of breath. That said, there are no radiographic findings specific for the diagnosis of ACS, and its role in this set\u00ad ting is primarily for excluding alternative diagnoses. Acute CHF secondary to ACS may present with classic radiographic fmdings. MEDICAL DECISION MAKING Order an ECG immedia tely on presentation to identify patients with STEMI, as they require immediate and aggressive reperfusion. Patients with cardiogenic shock, acutely decompensa ted CHF, ventricular dysrhythmias, and severe symptoms refractive to aggressive medical therapy also typically warrant emergent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). In patients with nondiag\u00ad nostic ECGs, proceed with cardiac marker testing. Patients with elevated cardiac markers should be treated as having a NSTEMI. Those whose initial set of cardiac markers are negative require serial ECG and biomarker testing. These patients should be stratified to identify those who are at high risk for adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Concerning factors that may identify high-risk patients include patients 65 years of age, the presence of at least 3 risk factors for CAD, known prior coronary stenosis of 50%, ST-segment deviations on ECG, elevated cardiac markers, the use of aspirin within the prior 7 days, and at least 2 anginal episodes within the past 24 hours. Further treat\u00ad ment should be dictated by the patient's category of risk (Figure 14-3). TREATMENT The proper management of ACS demands rapid and aggressive care. These patients require treatment in an area with ready access to resuscitation equipment includ\u00ad ing advanced airways and defibrillators. Address the patient's airway and circulatory status and place the patient on the cardiac monitor. Obtain N access and administer supplemental oxygen to maintain an SpO 2 94%. The immediate goals of therapy are to limit the supply-demand mismatch by improving coronary perfu\u00ad sion while reducing myocardial oxygen demand. Further treatment is dictated by condition into either STEMI or UA/NSTEMI pathways. ..... Nitroglycerin Nitroglycerin is widely used in patients with ACS and provides benefit via several different actions. It decreases myocardial oxygen demand by reducing the ventricular preload, improves myocardial perfusion by dilating the coronary vascular bed, and exhibits some mild antiplate \u00ad let properties. Start with sublingual doses of 0.4 mg in a disintegrating tablet or spray. This can be repeated every 3-5 minutes as necessary for refractive pain provided that the patient maintains a systolic blood pressure > 100 mmHg. Chest pain that persists after 3-5 doses warrants the initiation of IV therapy. Start an infusion at 10-20 meg/ min and rapidly titrate upward in 10-20 ments to achieve adequate pain control.

ACS, acute coronary syndrome; AMI, infarction; infusion and administer IV fluid boluses to any patients with signs of secondary hypotension. Patients with infarctions that involve the right ventricle are par\u00ad ticularly prone to hypotension given their preload depen\u00ad dent condition. Morphine Administer IV morphine to all patients with persistent pain despite treatment with nitroglycerin. Morphine reduces myocardial 02 demand by decreasing vascular tone (preload) ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROMES and limiting the catecholamine surge that typically accom\u00ad panies ACS. Avoid the use of morphine in hypotensive patients. Antiplatelet Therapy Begin immediate treatment with aspirin (ASA) in all patients with presentations concerning for ACS. Give 2:162 mg of a non-enteric-coated version. The first dose should be crushed or chewed to improve absorption and more quickly reach therapeutic blood levels. Aspirin alone reduces mortality by 23o/o in STEM! patients. Minor con\u00ad traindications (remote history of peptic ulcer disease, vague allergy, etc) should not preclude its use. Clopidogrel, prasugrel, and ticagrelor all function to inhibit platelet activation via blockade of the adenosine diphosphate (ADP) receptors and therefore work in har\u00ad mony with aspirin therapy. Clopidogrel has been the most extensively researched of the 3 and, therefore, is the most commonly used. A loading dose of 600 mg is recommended for patients with STEM! undergoing emergent PCI, whereas a 300-mg load is recommended for patients undergoing reperfusion with thrombolytics and those with UNNSTEMI. No loading dose is recommended in patients older than 75 years because of a concern for increased bleeding compli\u00ad cations. Both prasugrel and ticagrelor produce a more intense platelet inhibition, but do so at the expense of an increase in major bleeding complications. Although there is a legitimate concern for excessive bleeding in patients given AD P-receptor antagonists who subsequently undergo coro\u00ad nary artery bypass grafting (CABG), the definite benefit of platelet inhibition in patients with ACS far outweighs the potential concern for bleeding in the very low number of patients who actually require emergent CABG. Glycoprotein lib/Ilia inhibitors represent the third class of antiplatelet medications and function by inhibiting plate\u00ad let aggregation via blockade of the surface binding sites for activated fibrin. There are currently 3 available agents in this class (abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban ), and their use in patients with ACS has been extensively researched. These agents have been associated with an increase in major bleed\u00ad ing complications, and current guidelines recommend their use only for patients with ACS undergoing PCI. Anticoagu lation known contraindicat ions. LMWH ( enoxaparin) is generally preferred given its more predictable weight\u00ad based onset of activity, reduced tendency for immune\u00ad mediated thrombocytopenia, and lack of requirement for laboratory monitoring. That said, the longer half-life and lack of easy reversibility of LMWH is problematic in patients for whom invasive interventions are planned. UFH is typically recommended for patients undergoing PCI, whereas LMWH is preferred for patients with UA/ NSTEMI who are not undergoing emergent reperfusion. Fondaparinux and bivalirudin (a direct thrombin inhibitor) are two of the newer anticoagulant agents a vail\u00ad able for the management of patients with ACS and will likely have an expanding role in the near future. Both have been shown to be equally effective with fewer bleeding complications as compared with standard treatment with UFH or LMWH in select patient anti-ischemic, and antihypertensive properties. They reduce myocardial 0 2 demand via decreasing the heart rate, cardiac afterload, and ventricular contractilit y. Current guidelines recom\u00ad mend the initiation of treatment in all ACS patients with no contraindications (decompensated CHF, hypotension, heart blocks, and reactive airway disease). Metoprolol can be given in 5-mg N doses every 5 minutes for a total of 3 doses or as a single 50-mg oral dose if N treatment is not required. Reperfusion Therapy Patients with STEM! require immediate reperfusion therapy with either PCI or thrombolys is. The American College of Cardiology guidelines recommend a duration of no more than 90 minutes between patient presenta\u00ad tion and balloon inflation in those undergoing PCI and a duration of no more than 30 minutes between presenta\u00ad tion and treatment in those undergo ing thrombol ysis. PCI is the preferred modality owing to a decreased risk of bleeding complica tions, lower incidence of recurrent ischemia and infarction, and improved rates of surviv\u00ad ability. For patients with UA or NSTEM I, an early inva\u00ad sive approach (within 24-48 hours) utilizing PCI reduces the risk of death, AMI, and recurrent ACS. Thromb olysis is not recommended for patients with either UA or NSTEMI. DISPOSITION Admission Admit all patients with suspected ACS to a monitored bed for serial ECG testing and cardiac marker analysis. High\u00ad risk patients including those with elevated cardiac markers, ischemic ECG changes, and refractive symptoms warrant admission to a critical care setting for early PCI. STEM! patients require admission to a critical care setting after appropriate reperfusion therapy (PCI or thrombolysi s). Discharge Patients at a very low risk for ACS (young healthy patient, atypical history, normal ECG, and negative serial cardiac markers) who remain symptom free during an emergency department observation period of several hours can be safely discharged home with early stress testing arranged in the outpatient setting.

New York, NY: McGraw-Hill, 2011, pp. 367-385. Congestive Heart Failure Tarlan Hedayati, MD Negean Afifi, DO Key Points A normal ejection fraction does not exclude congestive heart failure (CHF), as CHF can occur secondary to either systolic or diastolic dysfunction. Nitroglycerin is the initial treatment of choice because it reduces both preload and afterload and rapidly improves patient symptoms. INTRODUCTION Congestive heart failure ( CHF) is the leading cause of hospital\u00ad izations in the United States in patients older than 65 years. Once symptomatic, up to 35% of patients will die within 2 years of the diagnosis, and more than 60% will succumb within 6 years. The annual costs of treatment are more than $27 billion and will only increase given the aging population. Heart failure occurs when the myocardium is unable to provide sufficient cardiac output to meet the metabolic demands of the body. As the myocardium can no longer keep up with the return of venous blood, pulmonary and systemic vascular congestion occurs. Common causes of CHF include myocardial infarction, valvulopathies, cardio\u00ad myopathies, and chronic uncontrolled hypertension. Based on the underlying pathophysiolo gy, heart failure can be divided into systolic and diastolic s ubtypes. Systolic heart failure develops when a direct myocardial injury impairs normal cardiac contractility causing a secondary decline in ejection fraction (eg, myocardial infarction). Diastolic heart failure develops when impaired cardiac compliance limits ventricular filling (preload) causing a consequent drop in overall cardiac output ( eg, left ventricu\u00ad lar hypertroph y). In acute decompensated CHF, the global decrease in cardiac output forces a compensatory increase in systemic 57 Consider acute coronary syndrome as the primary precipitant of CHF. CHF associated with cardiogenic shock maintains a very high mortality rate despite appropriate medical management. vascular resistance (SVR) to maintain vital organ perfu\u00ad sion. This increase in SVR is actually counterpro ductive and causes a further reduction in cardiac output as the already compromised myocardium now faces an ever higher afterload. The downward spiral continues as myo\u00ad cardial oxygen demand increases because of the increased ventricular workload, resulting in further compromi se of the myocardium. Consequent elevations in left atrial and ventricular pressures eventually beget pulmonary edema and respiratory distress. Decompensa ted CHF is common ly precipitated by acute coronary syndrome (ACS), rapid atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure, or medication and dietary noncompli\u00ad ance. Other important precipitants to consider are pulmo\u00ad nary embolus, uncontrolled hypertension, profound anemia, thyroid dysfunction, and states of increased meta\u00ad bolic demand such as infection. Cardiotoxic drugs includ\u00ad ing alcohol, cocaine, and some chemotherapeutic agents should also be considered. CLINICAL PRESENTATION History Patients most commonly present with shortness of breath with exertion or at rest with severe exacerbat ions. CHAPTER 15 Orthopnea, or dyspnea while lying flat, is common as a result of the redistribution of fluid from the lower extremities to the central circulation when the legs are elevated. The increase in central circulation produces a higher pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and secondary pulmona ry edema. Attempt to quantify the severity of the orthopnea by asking on how many pillows the patient sleeps and note any changes from baseline. Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea occurs when sleeping patients awake suddenly with marked shortness of breath with the need to sit up and hang the legs over the side of the bed or go to a window for air. In certain patients, pulmonary congestion presents rather occultly with a persistent mild nocturnal cough as the only symptom. Patients may complain of peripheral edema, but this is neither sensitive nor specific for CHF and should prompt an investigation for alternative etiologies. Right upper quadrant pain may occur in patients with hepatic conges\u00ad tion and can be confused with biliary colic. Always obtain a detailed review of systems to try to identify any possible precipitants of CHF. Specifica lly, ask patients about antecedent or ongoing chest pain, palpita\u00ad tions, recent illnesses or infections, and medication or dietary changes or noncom pliance. Physical Examination Quickly evaluate patient stability with a careful assessment of vital signs and a focused physical exam. Check the respi\u00ad ratory rate, obtain a pulse oximetry, look for accessory muscle use, and determine whether the patient can speak in complete sentences to assess the severity of respiratory distress. Decreased stroke volume and impaired cardiac output may manifest as tachycardia, a narrowed pulse pressure, or marked peripheral vasoconstriction. Recognize hypotension and/or signs of hypoperfusion immediately and treat as cardiogenic shock. After the initial assessment, focus on signs of total body volume overload. Patients with left ventricular failure typi\u00ad cally present with pulmonary signs, including inspiratory crackles, a persistent cough, or a \"cardiac wheeze.\" Patients with right ventricular failure show signs of gestion. edema, jugular jugular venous pressure with deep palpation of the right upper quadrant) (Figure 15-1). Auscultate the heart for murmurs or gallops. Although often difficult to appreciate in the emergency department (ED), an S3 gallop is highly specific for decompensated heart failure. DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES Laboratory Obtain a complete blood count to look for signs of anemia and a serum chemistry to evaluate renal function and rule out any electrolyte abnormalities (eg, hyperkalemia) that .A. Figure 15-1. Jugular venous distention. may lead to cardiac irritability and impaired function. Order cardiac enzymes to rule out ACS as the precipitating event, although patients in decompensated CHF may exhibit mild elevations in the absence of ACS because of the excessive strain placed on the myocardium. Regardless of etiology, patients in CHF with elevated cardiac enzymes have a worse prognosis. Check thyroid function tests if either hypothyroidism or thyrotoxi cosis is thought to be the source of heart failure. Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) is released from the ven\u00ad tricular myocytes in the presence of ventricular wall disten\u00ad tion. Measurement of serum BNP is especially helpful in differentiating CHF from underlying pulmonary conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or pneumonia. Levels <100 ng/dL have a high negative pre\u00ad dictive value, whereas those >400 ng/dL are consistent with decompensated CHF. Levels between 100 and 400 ng!dL are neither sensitive nor specific for CHF and may be indicative of pulmona ry embolism, cor pulmona le, cirrho\u00ad sis, or renal failure. Remember that heart failure is a clinical diagnosis, and BNP measurement is most helpful in clini\u00ad cally indeterminate cases. Electrocardiogram Obtain an emergent electrocardiogram (ECG) on all patients with suspected CHF to look for evidence of new or old myocardial injury, as well any precipitating arrhythm ias. Signs of atrial or ventricular hypertrophy may also be seen. Imaging Obtain a chest x-ray ( CXR) in all patients. Findings consis\u00ad at the lung peripher y), and vascu\u00ad lar cephalization (Figure 15-2).

New York: McGraw-Hill, 2008.) pneumothorax, or malignan cy. Importantly, a normal CXR does not exclude CHF, as radiographic findings can lag the onset of clinical symptoms by up to 6 hours. Echocardiography is often performed on an inpatient basis to assess ventricular size and function and rule out underlying valvular disease. Emergency practitioners skilled in ultrasonography may use bedside echocardiogra\u00ad phy to assess global cardiac function in the critically ill or clinically indeterminate cases. MEDICAL DECISION MAKING Rapidly address any signs of respiratory distress. Mildly symp\u00ad tomatic patients require supplemental oxygen, whereas patients in moderate to severe respiratory distress often require some form of ventilatory assistance. After respiratory stabilization, address the patient's hemodynamic status. A hypotensive patient with signs of shock requires vasopressor/ inotropic support, whereas a hypertensive patient will benefit from vasodilator and diuretic therapy. The differential diag\u00ad nosis of CHF is broad and includes many of its precipitants such as ACS, cardiac dysrhythmias, pulmonary embolus, and valvular disease. Bronchospastic disease and chronic pulmo\u00ad nary conditions (eg, COPD) may be difficult to distinguish from acute CHF. A good history combined with ancillary studies, including a BNP or CXR, may help with diagnosis (Figure 15-3). TREATMENT The goals of treatment include symptom management, hemodynamic stabilization, and reversal of precipitating factors. Place all dyspneic and hypoxic patients on supplemental oxygen via a nonrebreather mask and rap\u00ad idly escalate to noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) (eg, bilevel positive airway pressure ) in patients who fail to respond. When initiated early, NIPPV will reduce the need for endotracheal tube placement and mechanical ventilation in patients with decompensated CHF. The higher intrathoracic pressure improves oxygen\u00ad additional alveoli and car\u00ad thereby curtailing further pulmonary edema. Contraindications to NIPPV include patients who are at risk for aspiration, unable or too confused to cooperate, or those with significant facial trauma. Endotracheally intu\u00ad bate and initiate mechanical ventilation in patients who do not qualify for or fail NIPPV. Patients with hypotension and/or signs of systemic hypoperfusion are by definition in cardiogenic shock and require immediate hemodynamic support. Initiate a dobu\u00ad tamine infusion for inotropic (cardiac pump) support, but beware of worsening hypotension because of its vasodila\u00ad tory properties. Most patients will require concurrent dopamine or norepinephrine infusions to maintain an adequate blood pressure. Aggressively seek the precipitat\u00ad ing factor, keeping in mind that acute myocardial infarction is the most likely culprit. Obtain early cardiology consulta\u00ad tion to facilitate emergent bedside echocardiography and admission to an intensive care unit/critical care unit setting for further management. The majority of patients in acute CHF present with marked hypertension. In these patients, vasodilators are the initial therapy of choice. Nitroglycerin is the preferred agent as it rapidly decreases the ventricular preload and at higher doses reduces the cardiac afterload, thereby improv\u00ad ing overall cardiac output. Start with sublingual doses of CXR, chest ECG, unit; IV, intravenous; PND, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. 0.4 mg every 5 minutes. Severe exacerbations warrant IV nitroglycerin infusions. Start at a rate between 20 and 50 meg/min and rapidly increase in increments of 20-40 meg/min every 5-10 minutes. Titrate the infusion to symptomatic relief or systemic hypotensio n. Consider nitroprusside in patients who don't adequately respond, as it is a more potent arterial vasodilator. It is important to ask any patient requiring vasodilator therapy about the current use of phosphodiesterase-S inhibitors (eg, sildenafil, used in erectile dysfunction and pulmonary hyperten sion), as the combination of agents may lead to life-threatening drops in systemic blood pressure. Avoid overaggressive vasodilation in patients with conditions. Initiate IV loop diuretics (eg, furosemide) in all patients with signs of volume overload. Furosemide is not only a potent diuretic but also an effective venodila\u00ad tor, often producing symptomatic improvement long before the onset of diuresis. Start the dosing at 40 mg IV in patients naive to the drug, whereas those who take the agent chronically should have their home dose doubled. Evaluate patients who fail to diurese within 30 minutes for any evidence of urinary obstruction and re-dose as necessary. Bumetanide, torsemide, and ethacrynic acid are alternative loop diuretics, with ethacrynic acid being the agent of choice in patients with a history of severe sulfa allergy.

Of note, both of these agents are contraindicated in patients with acute decompensation. Oral furosemide is typically used for symptomatic relief, but no mortality benefits have ever been demonstrated. cases require an inpatient work-up including echocardiogra\u00ad phy and medication titration.

Rapidly distinguish between stable versus unstable presentatio ns, as unstable patients require immediate intervention. INTRODUCTION The recognition of dysrhythmia is an essential skill for all emergency physicians, as patients presenting with dys\u00ad rhythmias are relatively common and have the potential for rapid hemodynamic deteriora tion. Clinically, dys\u00ad rhythmias are classified as stable or unstable based on the presence or absence of adequate end-organ perfusion (ie, systemic hypotension, cardiac ischemia, pulmonary edema, or mental status changes). Dysrhythrnias are fur\u00ad ther divided by their rate into rate [HR] <60) additional subset of dysrhythmia, atrioventricular blocks, can present with any HR and represent a malfunc\u00ad tion in electrical conduction between the sinoatrial (SA) node, atrioventricular (AV) node, and bilateral ventricles. A thorough understanding of the origins of normal car\u00ad diac rhythm and electrical conduction is essential to prop\u00ad erly comprehend cardiac dysrhythmia. Normal cardiac conduction originates in the SA node and conducts through the atria to the AV node. In the majority of patients, the AV node is the only site where electrical signals can transmit between the atria and ventricles and therefore functions as the ultimate \"gatekeeper\" to the ventricles. Impulses then travel sequentially from the AV node to the bundle of His, the right and left bundle branches, the Purkinje fibers, and ultimately the ventricular myocardium. 63 Order a 12-lead electrocardiogram on stable patients and address potential etiologies, including acute coronary syndrome , electrolyte abnormal ities, toxic ingestions, and medication side effects. The normal electrocardiogram (ECG) waveform con \u00ad tains a P wave, QRS complex, and T wave. The P wave rep\u00ad resents atrial depolarization. It is immediately followed by the PR interval, which normally lasts between 120 and 200 msec in duration. The QRS complex represents ventricular depolarization and is normally <100 msec in duration. Delays in intraventricular conduction result in a widened (> 100 msec) QRS complex. The ST segment represents the plateau of ventricular depolarization and is normally iso\u00ad electric in appearance. Finally, the T wave represents ven\u00ad tricular repolarization. Of note, the segment extending from the end of a T wave to the beginning of the next P wave, known as the TP segment, should be used as the isoelectric baseline when performing any type of ECG analysis. Bradydysrhythrnias occur either because of depressed sinus node activity or inhibited electrical signal conduction. These are common in patients with structural heart damage, excessive vagal tone, taking certain cardioactive medications, or with specific electrolyte abnormalities (eg, hyperkalemia). Tachydysrhythmias occur because of enhanced automaticity from either the SA node or an ectopic focus and can originate from both atrial and ventricular sources. Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) occurs when re-entry loops are present in the AV node or accessory conduction pathways. Rhythms with a wide QRS complex represent ventric\u00ad ular depolarization that occurs outside of the normal CHAPTER 16 Table 16-1. PIRATES: Causes of atrial fibrillation.

Cardiac dysrhythmias vary by etiology, severity, and treatment. Atrial fibrillation (AF), for example, is com\u00ad mon and has multiple causes (Table 16-1). Although occasiona lly symptomatic and/or requiring emergent interven tion, many patients are typically unaware when they are in AF. Asymptomatic bradycardia is also a very common rhythm, especially in young, athletic patients. It can be a normal fmding in some people or result from medication use at therapeutic levels. Other bradydys\u00ad rhythmias, such as third-degree heart block, always elicit emergent concern . Tachydys rhythmias vary in a similar manner, from an isolated asympto matic atrial tachycardia to an emergently life-threatening ventricular fibrillati on, the initial dysrhythmia for the majority of patients in cardiac arrest. There are several important questions that need to be answered when attempting to identify a pathologic rhythm. First, determine the hemodynamic stability of the patient. Look for any signs of hypoperfusion, including systemic hypotension, cardiac chest pain, pronounc ed diaphoresis, altered mental status (AMS), or congestive heart failure. Second, quantify the rate of the dysrhythmia and classify as normal, slow, or fast. Third, identify the morphology of the rhythm (eg, narrow vs wide complex QRS). Next, deter\u00ad mine whether the observed dysrhythmia is irregular or regular in cadence. Finally, assess for any evidence of an AV conduction block. AV blocks are divided into first, second, and third degrees based on the PR interval and the cardiac rhythm. Narrow rhythms: Hyperkalemia, third-degree (complete) heart block CLINICAL PRESENTATION History Unstable patients may be too altered to offer any mean\u00ad ingful history. Employ any available friends, family, and emergenc y medical service personal for possible critical details. Unstable patients require immedia te intervention, and time should not be wasted on an excessively detailed history. In stable patients, ask about any previous epi\u00ad sodes, current medications, illicit drug use, and the tim\u00ad ing of symptom onset. Inquire about a history of any underlyi ng structural anomalies (eg, Wolf-Parkinson\u00ad White syndrome [WPW]), as this will help guide therapy (Figure 16-1). Finally, ascertain about past medical history. Although sinus bradycardia is a common finding in healthy adults, older patients with underlying coronary artery disease (CAD) and slow heart rates often have a pathologic source for their bradydysrhyth mia ( eg, inferior wall isch\u00ad emia, electrolyte abnormalities, or pharmacologic side effects). Similarly, although sinus tachycardia often accompanies conditions with increased sympathetic tone (eg, exercise, fever, cocaine use), older patients with a history of CAD, valvulop athy, or underlying pulmo\u00ad nary disease often have a pathologic source for their tachydysrhy thmia. Physical Examination Evaluate the patient's hemodynamic stability. Always note the triage vital signs and repeat frequent ly. Carefully pal\u00ad pate peripheral pulses to determine whether they corre\u00ad spond with the dysrhythmia displayed on the cardiac monitor. Assess for signs of end-organ hypoperfusion, including detailed cardiovascular (weak peripheral pulses), pulmonary (rales), and neurologic (AMS) examinations. Check for additional findings that may help identify the source of the dysrhyth mia. Patients with thyrotoxi cosis may have a goiter, peripheral tremor, and ocular proptosis. Discovering a dialysis catheter or palpable AV fistula should prompt concern for hyperkalemia. A sternotomy scar should prompt concern for either acute coronary syn\u00ad drome (ACS) or valvular disease as the precipitating source. DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES Electrocardiogram The initial evaluation of all patients with suspected dys\u00ad rhythmia includes continuous cardiac monitoring and an immediate 12-lead ECG unless patient instability necessi\u00ad tates either immediate cardioversion or electrical pacing. Measure the rate, determine whether the rhythm is regular or irregular (may need an additional rhythm strip), and classify the QRS complex as narrow (normal) or wide (>100 msec).

Note the short PR interval and slurred upstroke of the QRS complex (delta wave) due to abnormal atrioventricular signal conduction through the Bundle of Kent. Laboratory Obtain a complete blood count to exclude anemia and a metabolic panel to rule out electrolyte anomalies as the source of the dysrhythmia. Check cardiac enzymes when underlying cardiac ischemia is suspected and a serum digoxin level in any patient taking it. Consider a d-dimer and thyroid function tests in select patients with tachycar\u00ad dia at risk for either pulmonary embolism (PE) or thyroid disease, respectively. Imaging Imaging studies should include a chest x-ray looking for signs of congestive heart failure or valvulop athy. MEDICAL DECISION MAKING The evaluation of dysrhythmia is very algorithmic. Rapidly assess the hemodynamic stability of the patient and inter\u00ad vene in unstable patients. In stable patients, obtain a 12-lead ECG with or without rhythm strip to identify the rhythm. Treatments will vary depending on the rhythm and inciting event and range from vagal maneuvers to antidysrhythmic medications to DC electricity ( defibrilla\u00ad tion, cardiovers ion, or cardiac pacing) (Figure 16-2). Bradydysrhythmias In stable patients, examine the rhythm to ensure that a P wave precedes each QRS complex and that the PRinter\u00ad val remains constant throughout. A slow regular rhythm with a constant PR interval is either sinus bradycardia or sinus bradycardia with a first-degree AV block (PR interval >200 msec) and requires no urgent intervention. Search for and address any predisposing conditio ns. Bradycardic rhythms that feature more P waves than QRS complexes typically represent second- or third-degree AV blocks. Second-degree AV block is divided in Mobitz types I (Wenckebach) and II. Type I presents with a PR interval that progressi vely elongates until an impulse is not con\u00ad ducted to the ventricles, resulting in a dropped QRS on the ECG. A progressi vely decreasing interval between consecu\u00ad tive R waves is classic for this dysrhythmia. In second\u00ad degree AV block type II, although the PR interval remains constant, occasional P waves will not be conducted to the ventricles, resulting in a dropped QRS. Type II is more CHAPTER 16 Figure 16-2. Dysrhythmia diagnostic algorithm. serious than type I and typically represents a conduction blockade distal to the AV node. Complete disruption of signal conduction between the atria (P waves) and ventri\u00ad cles (QRS complexes) represents third-degree or complete heart block. The P waves and QRS complexes march inde\u00ad pendently of one another with no consistency between the two. The QRS complexes are referred to as escape beats and can be either narrow (junctional) or wide (ventricular) depending on their site of origin (Figure 16-3). Two additional bradycardias warrant mention. Junctional bradycardia is a slow regular rhythm with a narrow QRS complex and absent or abnormal P waves owing to its origin within the AV node. As this condition typically occurs because of medication side effects (eg, beta-blockers ), carefully elicit a medical history to help identify the etiology. Idioventricular rhythms (ventricular escape rhythms) originate in the ven\u00ad tricles and appear as regular wide QRS complex rhythms at a rate of 20-40 bpm with no discernible P waves. ..... Tachydysrhy thmias In stable patients, assess for the regularity of the rhythm and distinguish between a supraventricular (narrow QRS) versus ventricular etiology (QRS > 100 msec) (Figure 16-4). A rhythm that is fast, narrow, and regular is typically either sinus tachycardia, atrial flutter, or SVT. Slowing the heart DYSRHYTHMIAS A 8 16-3. Second-degree AV type I; B. Second-degree AV block (Mobitz type II). C. Third-degree AV block. (Reproduced with permission from Tintinalli JE, Kelen GO, Stapczynski JS. Emergency Medicine: A Comprehensive Study Guide. 6th ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, 2004.) rate with vagal maneuvers or adenosine aids in identifying the underlying rhythm and may treat SVT. Although appropriate concern should arise when using aden osine in patients with either known or ECG findings concerning for pre-excitation ( eg, WPW), it is generally saf e provided that the QRS complexes are narrow. Of note, SVT with aber\u00ad rancy (conduction through an accessory pathway or bun\u00ad dle branch block) is typically difficult to distinguish from VT. Always assume VT until proven otherwise, especially in elderly patients with underlying cardiac disease. Sinus tachycardia will appear with a P wave preceding each QRS and regular R-R intervals. Sinus tachycardia is often secondary to noncardiac issues, including pain, fever, anxiety, PE, illicit drug use (cocaine), alcohol withdrawal, thyrotoxico \u00ad sis, volume depletion, and anemia. Focus on identifying and treating the underlying cause of the tachycardia. SVT can be subdivided into AV nodal and atrioventricular re-entry tachycar\u00ad dias depending on the anatomy of the re-entry circuit. AVNRT has a re-entry loop contained within the AV node itself, whereas AVRT requires the presence of an accessory pathway ( eg, WPW) to complete the re-entry loop. With AVRT, signals that travel downward through the AV node and re-enter the atria through the accessory path\u00ad way (orthodromic) will exhibit narrow QRS complexes. The reverse situation is known as antidromic conduction and will exhibit wide QRS complexes. Wide QRS com\u00ad plexes are also present in patients with underlying bundle branch blocks (SVT with aberranc y). Regardless of SVT subtype, discernible P waves preceding the QRS complexes will be absent and the R-R intervals will be regular. Atrial flutter has a classic \"saw tooth\" appearance from the multiple flutter waves that precede the QRS complexes. The R-R intervals are usually regular unless there is vari\u00ad able conduction through the AV node. The most common presenting rate is -150 bpm and occurs when the flutter waves are conducted through the AV node in a 2:1 ratio. In addition to atrial flutter with a variable block, atrial fibrillation (AF) and multifocal atrial tachycardia (MAT) represent the irregular narrow QRS complex tachycardias. AF can be identified by irregular R-R intervals without discernible P waves. Although MAT is often confused with AF, the distinction is critical, as the treatment varies mark\u00ad edly. MAT will have varying P wave morphologies and irregular P-R and R-R intervals, but unlike AF, P waves will precede each QRS. MAT is most common in patients with underlying pulmonary disease, and as there is no specific cardiac treatment. Focus on addressing the underlying lung patholog y. Wide complex tachycardias typically require more emergent intervention than their narrow complex coun\u00ad terparts and are often encountered in the unstable or \"cod\u00ad ing\" patient. Besides the aforementioned SVT with aberrancy, VT and ventricular fibrillation (VF) are the remaining possibilities. VT presents with a rate > 120 bpm, QRS intervals > 120 msec, and no discernible P waves. Torsade de pointes is a unique subset of polymorphic VT that features a beat to beat variation in QRS morphol\u00ad ogy with a progressive twist in QRS axis. This condition usually arises from abnormal ventricular repolarization. TREATMENT Address patient airway, breathing, and circulation (ABCs), provide supplemental 02, ensure adequate peripheral N access, and initiate continuous cardiac monitoring. Tailor A I.

Treat those who are unstable with IV doses of atropine (0.5-1.0 mg) and epinephrine (0.3-0.5 mg over 2-3 minutes) if refractive. Initiate transcutaneous pacing and consider placement of an introducer catheter into the internal jugular or subclavian vein for transvenous pacing in all patients who fail to respond. Catecholamine infusions (eg, dopamine) may be necessary to maintain an adequate HR and blood pressure. Whereas second- degree AV block Mobitz type I typically requires no specific treatment, Mobitz type II and third-degree heart block require emergent intervention. Place transcutaneous pacer pads on the chest and initiate pacing in those that become unstable. To do so, set your defibrillator to the pacing mode with a rate of -80 bpm and gradually increase the voltage until a normal ventricu\u00ad lar rate is captured. Most patients will require IV analgesia and sedation while pacing. When transcutaneous pacing DYSRHYTHMIAS fails, the placement of a temporary transvenous pacer will be necessary. Obtain emergent cardiology consulta\u00ad tion in all Mobitz type II and third-degree patients, as most will require intensive care/critical care unit admis\u00ad sion and definitive pacemaker placement. Treat both junctional bradycardia and idioventricular rhythms analogous to other bradyrhythmias if symptom\u00ad atic. Accelerated idioventricular rhythms (rates >40 bpm) often accompany myocardial infarction and reperfusion and are typically well tolerated by the patient. Avoid treat\u00ad ment with typical antidysrhythmics and aggressively search for the inciting event. Tachydysrhy thmias Tachydysrhythmias vary widely with regard to etiology, severity, and treatment. Proper identification is essential to ensure appropriate intervention. Rapidly determine patient stability, as unstable patients require immediate electrical cardioversion or defibrillation. For cardioversion, ensure that the defibrillator is set to the SYNC mode before deliv\u00ad ering the shock to avoid precipitating VF. Defibrillate patients in pulseless VT and VF in the unsynchronized (default) mode. Treat AF and atrial flutter similarly by controlling the ventricular response and evaluating for the source of the tachycardia. Useful agents for slowing AV nodal conduc\u00ad tion include Diltiazem is an excellent first-line agent in the emergency department (ED) and can be given as an initial bolus of 0.25 mg/kg bolus followed by an infusion of 5-15 mg/hr. Carefully monitor for signs of hypotension and administer a sec\u00ad ond bolus (0.35 mg/kg) in 15 minutes as necessary for adequate rate control. Additional agents used to treat AF with a rapid ventricular rate include procainamide and amiodarone. Treat SVT with vagal maneuvers such as massage, ice-water immersion of the face, and patient-induced Valsalva are sometimes successful. If unsuccessful, administer escalating doses of IV adenosine in doses of 6 mg, and then 12 mg. Administer the medication rapidly, followed by a saline flush, as ade\u00ad nosine is quickly cleared from the circulation. Clinically, VT can present as a stable perfusing rhythm, a hemodynamically unstable patient, or a patient in cardiac arrest. Treat such patients with antiarrh Treatment of torsade de pointes should focus on removing the inciting agent and narrowing the QT inter\u00ad val. IV magnesium sulfate (2 g slow IV push) is the first\u00ad line agent for treatment. VF is never a stable rhythm. The rhythm tracing will demonstrate no discernible P waves or QRS complexes. This rhythm requires immediate defibrillation as it very quickly deteriorates. DISPOSITION Admission Admit all patients with dysrhythmia accompanied by signs of end-organ hypoperfusion or cardiac ischemia to an inten\u00ad sive care setting. Patients at risk for recurrent dysrhythmia or in need of medication titration should be admitted to a monitored setting. Discharge Patients with known AVNRT who are successfully treated in the ED or patients with AF/atrial flutter and adequate rate control can be safely discharged provided they remain asymptomatic and have access to appropriate follow up.

Wald, DO Key Points Always consider aortic dissection in patients presenting with the acute onset of chest or thoracic back pain. Initiate a rapid reduction in heart rate and blood pres\u00ad sure in all patients with a high clinical suspicion for aor\u00ad tic dissection before obtaining confirmatory diagnostic imaging. INTRODUCTION Acute aortic dissection is a rare but potentially life-threatening condition. Although the true incidence is unknown, it is estimated that there are between 6,000 and 10,000 new cases annually in the United States. Aortic dissection is more prevalent in men and in patients with advanced age, with approximately 75% occurring in patients between 40 and 70 years of age. Younger patients with aortic dissec\u00ad tion usually have a history of an underlying connective tissue disease. Of note, about half of all aortic dissections in women under the age of 40 years occur in the third tri\u00ad mester or early postpartum period. Risk factors for acute aortic dissection include chronic hypertension, a bicuspid aortic value, coarctation of the aorta, or inherited such as Ehlers-Danlos and Marfan syndromes. Vascular inflamma\u00ad tory cell arteritis or Takayasu arte\u00ad ritis are additional risk factors for dissectio n. Aortic dissection results from a tear in the intimal layer of the vessel wall. Common inciting factors include the chronic conditions listed previousl y, as well as illicit drug use or blunt thoracic trauma. High-pressu re pulsatile blood will travel through this tear into the media layer of the aorta, thereby separating the intima from the adventi\u00ad tia. This creates a false lumen for aortic blood flow that can 70 Stanford type A (proximal) dissections typically require surgical intervention, whereas Stanford type B (distal) dissections are managed medical ly. Complications of acute dissection include myocardial infarction, cardiac tamponade, aortic valve insufficiency, stroke, renal extend distally (antegrade ), proximally (retrograde ), or in both directions. Rarely, the false lumen will rupture through the adventitia, resulting in immediate hemody\u00ad namic collapse. The majority just distal to arteriosum (20%). The Stanford classification system divides aortic dissections clinically into types A and B. Type A dissections involve the ascending aorta, whereas type B dissections involve only the distal aorta (origin of the intimal tear is distal to the left subclavian artery) (Figure 17-1). CLINICAL PRESENTATION ..... History The classic presentation of an acute thoracic aortic dissec\u00ad tion is that of a 55-to 65-year-old male with chronic hyper\u00ad tension who develops a sudden onset of severe sharp or tearing chest pain radiating to the intrascapular area. Keep in mind that this is a fairly rare condition that often presents in an atypical manner. When obtaining the history, identify relevant risk factors and inquire about the quality, radiation, and intensity at onset of the pain. Type A dissections present most commonly with anterior chest pain (71 %) and less commonly with either back ( 47%) or abdominal pain (21 o/o ). AORTIC DISSECTION Figure 17-1. Stanford classification of aortic dissections A. Type A. B. Type B. (Reproduced with permission from Brunicardi FC, Andersen D, Billiar T, et al. Schwart z's Principles of Surgery. 8th ed. New York: McGraw-Hill Education, 2005.) Additional presenting complaints include syncope (13%) and stroke-like symptoms (6%). Type B dissections present most often with acute back (64%) and chest (63%) pain with increasing rates of abdominal pain (43%). Atypical presentations include patients with intermittent symptoms, pleuritic or positional pain, and isolated syncope. Painless aortic dissections have also been reported. Corresponding visceral symptoms including diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting, and pallor are often present. ...,.. Physical Examination The physical examination should initially focus on the general appearance of the patient and an assessment of his or her vital signs. Patients with acute dissections are in all 4 extremities and measure the blood pressure in both arms, taking note of any discrepancies. The presenting blood pressure cannot be used to either diagnose or exclude this condition, as roughly half of patients will have an elevated blood pressure, whereas an equal proportion will be either normotensi ve or hypoten \u00ad sive. Although a small percentage of the normal popula\u00ad tion will exhibit a blood pressure differential between the upper extremities, a blood pressure differential 20 mmHg in this clinical context should be considered highly suspi\u00ad cious. That said, the absence of a blood pressure differen\u00ad tial does not exclude aortic dissection. The cardiac examination should focus on any abnormal heart sounds. Consider pericardia! tamponade in patients with distant heart tones and associated hypotension, jugu\u00ad lar venous distention, and tachycardia. The presence of a diastolic murmur suggests secondary aortic regurgitation. Perform a focused neurologic examination, looking for signs of hemiplegia or paraplegia. Some of the more rare clinical findings associated with aortic dissection include Horner' s syndrome, superior vena cava syndrome, arterial occlusion limb nerve palsies, and bilateral testicu\u00ad lar tendern ess. It is important to realize that many of the classic physical examination findings are frequently absent, and therefore the history of present illness is often more significant than the physical exam. Always maintain a high index of suspicion for aortic dissection in the patient pre\u00ad senting with an acute coronary syndrome associated with neurologic or vascular signs and symptoms. DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES ...... Laboratory There are no laboratory studies that can reliably rule out the diagnosis of acute aortic dissectio n. A screening d-dimer assay has been shown to be highly sensitive (94-99%), but it should not be used in isolation to rule out acute dissection. Other laboratory studies (complete blood count, basic metabolic profile, troponin I, etc.) are often used to exclude or confirm an alternative diagnosis or complication of aortic dissectio n. ...,.. Electrocardiogram The electrocardiogram (ECG) has no primary role in the diagnosis of acute aortic dissection. It is often normal ( 31 o/o) or may show nonspecific abnormalities such ventricular hypertrophy (26%). As proximal aortic dissec\u00ad tions can frequently involve the coronary arteries (right > left), the ECG can be useful for detecting secondary cardiac ischemia. ..... Imaging Plain chest radiography is the most common initial imag\u00ad ing test. Approximately 80-90% of patients with aortic dissection will have an abnormal chest radiograph. An abnormal aortic contour (71 o/o) and widened mediastinum (64%) are the most commonly encountered findings. Additional findings include a left-sided pleural effusion or apical cap, a widened space (>5 mm) between the external vessel wall and calcified intima (egg-shell sign), rightward deviation of the trachea or a nasogastric tube, and down\u00ad ward deviation of theleft mainstem bronchus (Figure 17-2). Comparison with a prior chest radiograph is often useful. Of note, the classic radiographic findings are not reliably present, and a normal chest x-ray (OCR) cannot be used to rule out acute aortic dissection. Reliably excluding or confirming the presence of acute aortic dissection requires one or more advanced imaging techniques. Computed tomography (CT) angiography is the most commonly employed modality. Newer generation helical CT imaging is readily available in most emergency departments (EDs) and is both highly sensitive ( 100%) and specific (98%) for dissection. Furthermore, it can CHAPTER 17 Figure 17-2. Chest radiograph of a 7 4-year-old female with an aortic dissection. Note the widened mediastinum and rightward tracheal deviation. clearly delineate the vascular anatomy to distinguish between ascending and descending pathology and can identify potential alternative diagnoses for the patient's presentation (Figure 17-3 and 17-4). The limitations of CT angiography include the need to transfer the patient out of the acute care setting, exposure to ionizing radiation, and the administration of radiocontrast media. Bedside echocardiogra phy is a reasonable alternative for patients deemed too unstable for CT. Although relatively easy and quick to perform, transthoracic echocardiography is only 59.3% sensitive for the detection of acute dissection. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), however, is 98% Figure 17-3. Computed tomography of the patient from Figure 17-2. Note the intimal flap in the descending aorta consistent with a Stanford type B dissection. Figure 17-4. Coronal computed tomography angiogram of a 49-year-old male with a Stanford type A aortic dissection. sensitive for dissection. Furthermore, TEE can identify con\u00ad current pericardia! effusion and valvular pathology. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is also a highly sensitive modality for diagnosing acute aortic dissectio n. However, the variable availability of MRI combined with the prolonged time required outside of the ED severely limits its utility in this context. MEDICAL DECISION MAKING In cases of a suspected aortic dissection, an accurate patient history will likely provide the most valuable infor\u00ad mation to guide your work up. Always consider alterna\u00ad tive life-threatening conditions in your differential diagnoses, pulmo\u00ad nary embolism, abdominal aortic aneurysm, and tension pneumothorax. Use the patient's description of the pain, a history of relevant risk factors, and the results of rapid bedside imaging techniques (eg, portable CXR, bedside ultrasound) to drive the formation of your differential diagnosis. Rapidly determine patient stability, as this will dictate how urgently consulting physicians should be called to the bedside and whether the patient will be able to leave the department for advanced diagnostic imaging (Figure 17-5). TREATMENT The initial management of acute aortic dissection should focus on a rapid reduction in heart rate and blood pressure to decrease the shear forces on the aorta wall and limit further propagation of the false lumen. Numerous medica\u00ad tions are available for this purpose, and regardless of the specific agent(s) employed, the target heart rate is <60 bpm and target systolic blood pressure is 90-120 mmHg. Ensure AORTIC DISSECTION Clinical presentation concerning for acute dissection (sudden onset chest, back, or abdominal pain) Evaluate risk factors, focused H&P (BP differential?), CXR and ECG Figure and physical examination; HR, heart rate. adequate pain control with the use of opiates to limit excessive sympathetic stimulation. Initiate treatment in all patients with a high clinical suspicion before a confirmatory diagnosis is made. Beta-blockers are generally considered the first- line therapy for acute dissection given their ability to reduce both blood pressure and heart rate. Because of its short duration of action and rapid onset, esmolol is an excellent first-line agent. Start with a loading dose of 500 meg/kg given over 1 minute followed by a continuous infusion at 50 meg/kg/min. If the desired ventricular response has not been achieved within 5 minutes, repeat the loading dose and increase the infusion to 100 meg/kg/min. If the desired ventricular response has not been achieved within another CHAPTER 17 5 minute span, give a third and final loading dose of 500 meg/kg and increase the infusion up to a max rate of 200 meg/kg/min. Patients frequently remain hypertensive despite achiev\u00ad ing the ideal heart rate. In such situations, begin a continuous infusion of an arterial vasodilator such rdipine or clevidipine are acceptable. Regardless of which medication is used, never initiate vasodilator therapy until the heart rate is adequately suppressed with beta-blockers to avoid reflex tachycardia and propagation of the dissection. As an alternative, labetalol is a reasonable single agent due to its selective a1 and nonselective beta-blocking prop\u00ad erties. Give an initial dose of 10-20 mg as a slow N bolus over 2 minutes. If the desired blood pressure and heart rate are not achieved within 10 minutes, administer escalating doses (ie, 20 mg, 40 mg, 80 mg, 160 mg) at 10-minute intervals to a cumulative maximum dose of 300 mg. Labetalol can also be given as a continuous infusion. Start the infusion at 0.5 mg/min and increase by 0.5 mg/min every 15 minutes to a max dose of 2.0 mg/min as necessary. If necessary, additional boluses of N labetalol can be given while concurrently titrating the infusion to more rapidly achieve the goal heart rate and blood pressure. Stanford type A dissections require prompt cardiothoracic consulta\u00ad tion for operative repair, whereas type B dissections are typically managed medically. DISPOSITION Admission All patients with an acute aortic dissection require hospital admission to an intensive care unit setting. Discharge A patient in whom aortic dissection has been ruled out should be discharged only when there was an initial low clinical suspicion and all other concerning etiologies for the presenting complaints have been excluded. Patients with known chronic aortic dissections can be safely dis\u00ad charged provided their blood pressure is adequately con\u00ad trolled and their presenting complaint is unrelated to the underlying dissection. At times subspecia lty consultation may be necessary to assist with disposition. SUGGESTED READING Klompas M. Does this patient have an acute Diagnostic challenges and 29:789-800. Hypertensive Emergencies Erik K. Nordquist, MD Key Points Hypertension is a very common finding in emergency department patients. Evidence of acute end-organ dysfunction in the setting of hypertension is rare but requires emergent diagnosis and treatment. Depend on the history and physical to guide the clinical evaluation of patients with severe hypertension. INTRODUCTION Hypertension affects up to 30% of the total adult popula\u00ad tion and is one of the most common medical conditions in the United States. Of these individuals, nearly 75% have inadequately controlled blood pressure (BP) (beyond nor\u00ad motensive limits of 140/90 mmH g), and only half are tak\u00ad ing their medications correctly as prescribed. That said, fewer than 1% of all patients with hypertension will ever develop a hypertensive emergen cy. Patients presenting with a systolic BP :?: 180 mmHg or a diastolic BP :?:llO mmHg are classified as having severe hypertension. Evaluating a patient with severe hyperten\u00ad sion should focus on the rapid distinction between hyper\u00ad tensive emergenc y or hypertensive urgency, as the treatment and disposition differ dramatica lly. Hypertensive emergency is defined as an acute elevation in BP (:?:180/llO mmHg) associated with active end-organ damage, specifi\u00ad cally ongoing injury to the brain, heart, aorta, kidneys, and/or eyes. Hypertensive urgency is less clearly defined, but can be thought of as a severe elevation in blood pres\u00ad sure without evidence of acute end-organ dysfunction. The suggested mechanism behind hypertensive emer\u00ad gency requires a sudden increase in systemic vascular 75 Emergent blood pressure control is contraindicated in asymptomati cally hypertensive patients without evidence of end-organ dysfunction. resistance due to an unregulated surge in circulating vaso\u00ad constrictors. This spike in BP causes undo stress on the vascular wall with consequent endothelial injury. The injured endothelium produces pathologic increases in vas\u00ad cular permeability, activation of the platelets and coagula\u00ad tion cascade, and the localized deposition of intraluminal fibrin. Secondary fibrinoid necrosis of the arteriolar end\u00ad organ circulation results in significant tissue hypoperfu\u00ad sion and consequent organ system dysfunction. Most individuals presenting with hypertensive emer\u00ad gency will carry a previous diagnosis of hypertension. When determining the goals for BP treatment, it is important to understand the effects of longstanding hypertension on the cerebral circulation. Chronic hypertension forces a shift in cerebral autoregulation, allowing patients to tolerate signifi\u00ad cant elevations in blood pressure without any signs of cere\u00ad bral end-organ damage. Conseque ntly, the overaggressive reduction of systemic BP in this setting, even if only decreased to normotensi ve limits, may lead to secondary hypoperfusion and ischemia of the central nervous system (CNS). Always remember that treating blood pressure based on numbers alone, without considering the clinical context, can be altogether quite harmful for the patient. CLINICAL PRESENTATION History CHAPTER 18 Patients with severe hypertension require a rapid evalua\u00ad tion for evidence of end-organ damage. Start with a focused history and comprehensi ve review of systems, inquiring about the presence of chest pain, back pain, shortness of breath, hematuria or decreased urine output, and neurologic complaints including numbness, weak\u00ad ness, headache, confusion, and visual disturbances. A more detailed history related to specific diagnoses follows. Hypertensive encephalopath y. Patients with hyperten\u00ad sive encephalop athy present with neurologic complaints including altered mental status, severe headache, seizures, vomiting, and visual disturbances. The mental status changes range from drowsiness to confusion to outright coma. Intracranial hemorrhage. Patients with intracranial hemorrhage present with severe headache (often sudden onset), focal neurologic deficits, and/or altered mental status. Acute pulmonary edema. Patients with flash pulmo\u00ad nary edema present with acute shortness of breath. Variable associated symptoms include orthopnea, hemoptysis, and chest pain or pressure. Acute coronary syndrome. Patients with acute coro\u00ad nary syndrome usually present with chest pain, although subtle signs of congestive heart failure may be the only presenting complaint. Aortic dissection. Patients with aortic dissection pres\u00ad ent with severe chest and/or back pain, often of a tearing quality. Associated symptoms include neurologic deficits, syncope, and abdominal pain, as well as constitutional symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, or diaphoresis. Acute renal failure. Patients with acute renal failure often present with relatively subtle symptoms. A earful history will often elicit hematuria, oliguria, or anuria. Patients may also present with swelling of the lower extremities or shortness of breath due to significant fluid retention. Physical Examination Begin by verifying that the elevated BP reading was obtained with a cuff appropria tely sized for the patient. Cuffs that are too small will lead to spuriously high BP readings. The width of the cuff bladder (inflatable por\u00ad tion of the cuff) should equal approximately 40% of the arm circumference. The length of the cuff bladder should equal -80% of the arm circumference. Perform a detailed physical exam, focusing on the neurologic, cardiac, pul\u00ad monary, and abdominal examinations. A more detailed description of expected fmdings related to specific diag\u00ad noses follows. Hypertensive encephalopat hy. Check for any signs of altered mental status. Of note, this can present as only a subtle confusion.

Careful funduscopic examination may reveal reti\u00ad nal hemorrhages and papilledema. Intracranial hemorrhage.

Patients will often be dia\u00ad phoretic and may have evidence of heart failure on exam. Aortic dissection. A blood pressure differential of >20 mmHg between arms or a new aortic insufficiency mur\u00ad mur suggests the presence of an aortic dissection. Acute renal failure. Physical exam may reveal evidence of fluid overload but is often rather unremarkable. DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES Electrocardiogram Perform an electrocardiogram with any suspicion for acute cardiac ischemia. Laboratory Laboratory studies are most useful to identify end-organ injury. Obtain a urinalysis (specifically looking for hema\u00ad turia or proteinuria) and serum blood urea nitrogen and creatinine to evaluate for acute kidney injury. Check a urine pregnancy test on all females of reproductive age to rule out evolving eclampsia. Order cardiac enzymes in patients complaining of chest pain, back pain, or shortness of breath. Imaging Obtain a head computed tomography (CT), intracranial hem\u00ad orrhage in patients presenting with altered mental status, papilledema, focal neurologic deficits, or seizure. Order a chest x-ray (CXR) to look for signs of flash pulmonary edema or aortic dissection in patients with chest pain, back pain, or shortness of breath. Pursue CT angiography of the chest and abdomen in patients with suspicion of aortic dissection. MEDICAL DECISION MAKING Rapidly evaluate all patients with severe hypertension for the presence of hypertensive emergency (hypertensive encephalop athy, intracranial hemorrhage, coronary syndrome, aortic dissection, and HYPERTENSIVE EMERGENCIES Severe hypertension (BP > 180/110) History and physical exam, re-measure BP Gradual normalization of BP over 24-48 hours with oral anti-hypertensives Figure 18-1.

This is accomplished with the use of easily titratable IV medications (Table 18-2). Always tailor your choice of agent to its mechanism of action to ensure the optimal management of individual hypertensive emergencies (Table 18-3). Aortic dissection is the exception to this rule and requires a rapid reduction in systolic BP to < 100 mmHg and heart rate to <60 bpm. Regarding the treatment of intracranial hemorrhage, ideal BP goals remain controver\u00ad sial. A cautious reduction of systolic BP <200 mmHg or diastolic BP < 110 mmHg is recommended, and immediate consultation with a neurosurgeon is advised. Immediate aggressive BP reduction is contraindicated in hypertensi ve urgency, as overzealous treatment can lead to secondary cerebral hypoperfusion and CNS ischemia. Gradually reduce the BP to normotensive limits over a period of 24-48 hours with the use of oral antihypertensive medicines. DISPOSITION .....

In: Emergency Medicine: Study York, NY: McGraw-H ill, 2011, pp. and management Chest. 2007;131:1949. Syncope Trevor J. Lewis, MD Key Points Place all patients with syncope on a cardiac monitor, obtain a STAT bedside glucose level, and check continu\u00ad ous pulse oximetry. Obtain a detailed history of the events surrounding the episode, including pertinent data from any available bystanders such as family and emergency medical service personnel. INTRODUCTION Syncope is defined as a transient loss of consciousness with an inability to maintain postural tone. The event is classi\u00ad cally followed by a spontaneous recovery to normal menta\u00ad tion. Between 12% and 48% of the U.S. population will experience a syncopal episode at some point in their life\u00ad time. It is the presenting complaint in 1-3% of emergency department (ED) visits and accounts for 1-6% of hospital admissions. The etiology of syncope encompasses a wide variety of disorders ranging from the benign to the acutely life-threatening. Often the cause of syncope remains elu\u00ad sive within the ED. That said, a careful history and physical exam combined with the appropriate ancillary testing will help identify high-risk individuals who require hospital admission for further work-up and management. Syncope occurs secondary to impaired blood flow to either the reticular activating system or the bilateral cere\u00ad bral hemispheres. Potential etiologies include transient systemic hypotension central nervous system (CNS) hypoperfusion (eg, The reduction in uncon\u00ad sciousness and a loss of postural tone. A reflexive sympa\u00ad thetic response combined with the recumbent positioning of the patient results in restored cerebral perfusion and a 80 All patients with a syncopal episode require an electro\u00ad cardiogram. Admit all patients with risk factors for a cardiac etiology or alternative life-threatening conditions. return to a normal level of consciousnes s. Patients who experience the sensation of nearly \"passing out\" without an overt loss of consciousness are termed near-syncope or presyncope. From a clinical standpoint, both near-syncope and syncope are approached in the same manner. For clinical purposes, syncope is classified by etiology. Examples include neural mediated (reflex), orthostatic, cerebrovascular, and cardiac. Neurally mediated (reflex) syncope. Also referred to as \"vasovagal syncope;' this occurs because of an excessive parasympathetic output in response to a stressful event. The resulting combination of bradycardia and vasodilation reduces the overall cardiac output and thereby inhibits adequate cerebral perfusion. Prodromal symptoms are common and include subjective feelings such as dizziness, warmth, or lightheadedness. Certain situations involving increased vagal tone such as forceful coughing, micturi\u00ad tion, and defecation can also initiate this reflex. Orthostatic syncope. This occurs because of transient arterial hypotension after a positional change to either sitting upright or standing. The underlying mechanism depends on either significant volume depletion (bleeding, dehydration) or intrinsic autonomic dysfunction. Elderly patients tend to be the most prone to autonomic dysfunction secondary to blunted sympathetic responses and medication side effects. Cerebrovascular syncope. Cerebrovascular disorders are rarely the cause of syncope. That said, loss of conscious\u00ad ness can occur after a subarachnoid hemorrhage when the intracranial pressure rises suddenly and the cerebral perfu\u00ad sion is transiently lowered. Patients typically have a pro\u00ad longed post-event recovery, which helps to differentiate cerebrovascular syncope from alternative etiologies. Cardiac syncope. This occurs when either structural heart defects or cardiac dysrhythmias transiently impair cardiac output. These events frequently occur without warning, which helps to distinguish cardiac syncope from alternative etiologies. In cases of structural heart disease, the syncopal event typically occurs during or immediately following exercise. Classic examples include hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and aortic stenosis. Very rarely, pulmonary embolism (PE) can pres\u00ad ent as isolated syncope. Of note, cardiac syncope tends to have the worst prognosis, with 1-year mortality rates of 18-33%. CLINICAL PRESENTATION ...... History A comprehensive history is critical and may identify the etiology in up to 40% of cases. It is very important to clarify all of the events immedia tely preceding, during, and after the episode. Interview all family members and emer\u00ad gency medical service personnel present during the event. Inquire about any concerning prodromal symptoms including headache (ie, subarachnoid abdominal aortic aneurysm [AAA] or ectopic pregnanc y). Obtain a detailed past medical history and review all cur\u00ad rent medications. Patients with significant cardiac histories are at higher risk of arrhythmia, whereas elderly patients on multiple medications are predisposed to orthostatic syncope. Antecedent dizziness, nausea, and dia phoresis or symptoms occurring after moving from a recumbent or sitting to upright position suggest a benign vasovagal or orthostatic episode respectively. Syncope that occurs either suddenly without prodrome or with physical exer\u00ad tion suggests arrhythmia or structural heart disease (aor\u00ad tic stenosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopath y). A prolonged recovery period after syncope indicates a cerebrovascular etiology (stroke, seizure, SAH), as classically all patients should regain consciousness within several seconds of the event. ...... Physical Examination Always obtain triage vital signs and repeat when abnormal. Obtain blood pressure (BP) measurements in both arms, looking for unequal pressures suggestive of aortic dissec\u00ad tion. Consider orthostatic vitals, comparing recumbent SYNCOPE and standing vital signs. Significant BP findings include a drop in systolic BP by :2:20 mmHg or an absolute value ::;90 mmHg when standing. Orthostasis suggests volume deple\u00ad tion or medication side effects. The cardiovascular exam should include a detailed auscultation of the heart, listen\u00ad ing for arrhythmias or any murmurs suggestive of underly\u00ad ing structural heart disease. A detailed neurologic exam should identify any focal neurologic deficits. Perform a rectal exam with stool guaiac analysis to assess for gastro\u00ad intestinal ( GI) blood loss. DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES ...... Laboratory Routine laboratory evaluation is useful only when indi\u00ad cated by the history and physical exam. Obtain a rapid bedside glucose in all patients with an altered sensorium. Beside urine pregnancy testing is important for all females of reproduc tive age. Check a complete blood count in all patients with a history of bleeding or a positive stool guaiac. Order a basic metabolic panel with any concern for cardiac dysrhythmia secondary to significant electrolyte abnormalities. Finally, check cardiac markers in patients with antecedent chest pain or shortness of breath. ...... Electrocardiogram Although the yield is relatively low ( <5%) for discerning the source of a syncopal event, obtain an electrocardio\u00ad gram (ECG) in all patients to rapidly identify any emergent life threats. Concerning abnormalities on ECG include the following: 1. Signs of ischemia or strain (Q waves, T wave, and ST-segment changes, right bundle branch block) 2. Signs of conduction anomalies (prolonged QRS or QT intervals, atrioventricular blocks, sinus pauses/a rrest) 3. of cardiomyop athy (left ventricular hypertrophy with Imaging Routine computed tomography ( CT) imaging of the head is not warranted unless directed by the history and physical. Indications include signs and symptoms sugges\u00ad tive of a cerebrovascular etiology such as an antecedent headache, focal neurologic deficits on physical exam, or a prolonged recovery phase after the syncopal event. Chest radiographs may be helpful to evaluate for signs of car\u00ad diomegaly, aortic dissection, or congestive heart failure (CHF). Indications include syncope that occurs without prodrome or is preceded by chest pain or shortness of breath. CHAPTER 19 - J J J ,.., * 1--\"\" t' ,1 _,, II I,\\ vi i- I . r v ... j Ll v r- r I ,....

MEDICAL DECISION MAKING Manage all syncopal patients in a standardized stepwise fashion. Start with a broad differential focusing on life\u00ad threaten ing causes of syncope. Review the patient's ini\u00ad tial vital signs and obtain a bedside capillary glucose. Obtain a STAT ECG and place the patient on the cardiac monitor. Take a careful and detailed history including any bystander accounts. Review the patient's past medi\u00ad cal history and note all current medica tions. Focus the physical exam on the cardiovascular and neurologic sys\u00ad tems. Tailor any ensuing laboratory and imaging studies to abnorma lities discovered during the history and physical exam. After excluding any acute life threats, focus on the more benign causes, keeping in mind that often times the exact etiology is not identified in the ED (Figure 19-2). TREATMENT Rapidly determine hemodynamic stability and initially focus on supportive care. Obtain IV access, start supple \u00ad mental oxygen in hypoxic or dyspneic patients, and initi\u00ad ate continuous cardiac monitoring. Check a bedside glucose and give supplemental dextrose as indicated. The remainder of treatment should focus on the inciting event. Cardiac syncope.

Dyspnea Shari Schabowski, MD Chuang-yuan Lin, MD Key Points Determine whether an immediate life threat is present. Answer 3 key questions when approaching patients in moderate to severe respiratory distress. Diagnose causes of dyspnea by using a structured step\u00ad by-step anatomic approach. INTRODUCTION Dyspnea, from the patient's perspective, is known as \"shortness of breath.\" This is a sensation of breathlessness or \"air hunger\" manifested by signs of difficult or labored breathing, often owing to a physiologic aberration. Tachypnea is rapid breathing. Dyspnea may or may not involve tachypnea. Hyperventilation is ventilation that exceeds metabolic demands, such as can be caused by a psychological stressor (eg, anxiety attack). From the physician's perspective, dyspnea is caused by impaired oxygen delivery to tissues. This can begin at the mechanica l level, with any possible cause of airway obstruction, and can end at the cellular level, with any chemical inability to offload oxygen to tissues. If time permits, a systematic walk-through from airway to tissue can help elucidate the more difficult diagnoses. However, treatment for life-threatening severe respiratory distress must be initiated during, or even before, the diagnostic work-up. CLINICAL PRESENTATION Start your initial assessment of the severity of the presenta \u00ad tion with these 3 questions: 1. Does the patient need to be intubated immediatel y? 84 Do not hesitate. Initiate treatment in cases of respiratory distress immediately, even if the diagnostic work-up is incomplete. This may be demonstrated by the patient's: a. Failure to oxygenate b. Failure to ventilate c. Failure to protect the airway If \"yes\" to any of the above, intubate immedia tely. If the patient cannot oxygenate, there will be anoxic injury, espe\u00ad cially brain injury, within seconds to minutes. The inability to perform the act of breathing (failure to ventilate) leads to carbon dioxide buildup, and the ensuing acidosis can lead to cardiac dysfunction. Finally, if the patient cannot maintain an open airway (due to brain injury, mechanical occlusion, etc.), there will be threat to both oxygenation and ventilation, warranting immediate intubation. 2. Is the respiratory distress rapidly reversible? Recognizing and promptly intervening on the rapidly reversible causes of severe respiratory distress can prevent the need for intubation. Delays in therapy may cause the patient to quickly decompensate. Some of these reversible causes (and their solutions) are as follows: Hypoxia (administer epinephrine/ antihistamine) 3. Can he run? Imagine the patient had to run for his or her life (in many ways, this is what the patient is doing). How long could the patient go before he or she collapsed? What is the patient's physiologic reserve? For example, is the patient young and healthy or elderly with comorbidities? Consider all of the following in this assessment: airway, chest walUmusc ulature, diaphrag \u00ad matic excursion, posture, age, body mass index, car\u00ad diopulmonary status, and baseline exercise tolerance. The decision to intubate or to wait is based on the patient's ability to maintain the work of breathing. If the patient is stable, set time limits and reassess response to therapy frequently. If the patient has poor reserve or already has respiratory fatigue, it may be wiser to intubate electively rather than during a crash\u00ad ing situation. ..... History Relevant questions to answer during history taking include the following: What makes the dyspnea worse? Is it exer\u00ad tional? Is it positional? When does the dyspnea occur? Has the patient felt this dyspnea, or similar dyspnea, before? What are the circumstances surrounding the dyspnea? What is the patient's medical condition; any predisposi \u00ad tions toward dyspnea? While asking those questions, con\u00ad sider the following factors. Positional dyspnea. In an upright position, fluid is dependent and aeration is maximized at the apices. The upright tripod position is the optimal position for effective respirations: The diaphragm is able to reach full excursion; there is no restriction of chest wall movement; the airway is maximally patent. A history of dyspnea when lying down suggests congestive heart failure ( CHF) or pericardia! compro \u00ad mised, any increase in cardiac work and oxygen demand will exacerbate the problem. This applies to every cause of dyspnea, from primary pulmonary disease to cardiac dis\u00ad ease to anemia. Determine whether there are recent changes to how easily a patient starts feeling dyspneic. Be especially concerned if there is new dyspnea at rest. Transient dyspnea. If defined events of dyspnea are described that resolve without intervention, this sug\u00ad gests a reversible or transient cause (ie, dysrhyth mia, pulmonary embolism [PE], perceived dyspnea with panic attacks ). Recurrent dyspnea. The past predicts the future. \"The last time I had these symptoms it was my \". Fill in the blank: asthma, PE, CHF, dysrhythmia. Past medical history. A baseline pulmonary disease, car\u00ad diac disease, history of bleeding, or bleeding disorder may manifest unexpectedly as a patient complaint of dyspnea. Exposures. Several exposures can provoke dyspnea, including cleaning products, angiotensin -converting enzyme inhibitors, allergens, irritants, carbon monoxide. DYSPNEA In these cases, there is a temporal relationship between exposure and onset of dyspnea. Activities of daily living. Baseline exercise tolerance is important historic information that helps you to judge the severity of the acute process in addition to providing infor\u00ad mation regarding cardiac status. Ask about whether the patient can do day-to-day chores. A patient who reports trouble changing clothes or doing dishes tells much about their baseline-and how quickly they may decompensate in the emergency department. ..... Physical Examination A patient's visual appearance reveals much about their degree of respiratory distress. This assessment can be done concur rently with the history. Patients sit in the tripod position (hands on knees with chest propped forward, neck extended) to open their airways while in severe dis\u00ad tress. Look for retractions, intercostal tugging, or even paradoxical breathing (sucking in the abdomen when breathing), which indicates mechanical breathing insuffi\u00ad ciency. Patients in extremis can look groggy or lethargic due to respiratory fatigue/collapse. Next guide your physical exam by mentally walking down the anatom y required for oxygenation and ventilation. The radiographic studies mentioned in this section are adjuncts meant to confirm the findings on your physical exam. Upper airway. Dyspnea caused by partial upper airway obstruction is typically associated with sonorous respira\u00ad tions if it originates in the oropharynx (ie, the tongue), or stridor and voice change if anatomically related to the tra\u00ad chea or vocal cords. Causes of dyspnea in the upper airway are typically visible on exam or by nasopharyngeal scope. Use radiographs or a contrast computed tomography (CT) of the neck to evaluate soft tissue swellings near the pharynx. Bronchi. When dyspnea is caused by bronchial pathology-wh foreign body, inflammat ion, infection, or bronchospa sm-it is typically associa ted with wheezing (most commo nly expirato ry, but may be inspira tory, or Chest x-ray (CXR) may reveal bronchial cuffing. Alveolar. Alveoli function by maximizing contact between air pockets and capillary beds. Dyspnea occurs if alveoli are filled with fluid (ie, blood, pus, or water), collapsed (ie, atelec\u00ad tasis), or destroyed (eg, emphyse ma). Alveolar pathology is typically associated with crackles or rales on exam and CXR will show \"socked in\" solid consolidations. Interstitial space. Fluid or inflammation in the int er\u00ad stitial space inhibits oxygen transfer to blood cells. This unusual and potentially illusive cause of dyspnea will manifest with dry crackles on exam and be seen on CXR as a \"hazy but spongy\" density. Diaphragm. The diaphragm is responsible for active inspiration. If the diaphragm is restricted (ie, increased intra-abdomina l pressur e from mass, pregnan cy, or CHAPTER 20 ascites or paresis/p aralysis of the musculature ), full tidal volume may not be achieved. On the physical exam, gross asymmetric chest wall expansion or abdominal disten\u00ad tion/ascites can be clues of diaphragmatic dysfunction or impairment. Look for asymmetric diaphragm atic excur\u00ad sion on a good inspiratory CXR. Chest wall. Chest wall expansion is important for unimpeded respiration. Any disorder that restricts wall motion may cause dyspnea (ie, paresis/paralysis, neuro\u00ad muscular junction or muscular dysfunction, pain from contusion or rib fractures). Do not underestimate splint\u00ad ing from chest wall pain-even from apparently minor injuries. Inspection of the chest wall during respiration will help you to assess this aspect of breathing. Use CXR to look for rib fractures and/or pulmonary contusion (haziness at site of trauma). Pleural space. The pleural space is a potential space present to facilitate movement of the lungs within the chest wall. If the space is filled with fluid (ie, effusion, pus, blood) or air, dyspnea can occur. If the pleural space is occupied, it will typically cause decreased breath sounds on the effected side. Fluid causes decreased resonance, whereas air causes increased resonance. Abnormalities will typically be seen on CXR; the addition of a lateral decubitus radiograph of the chest may be helpful. Look for extra-lucent edges that indicate a pneumothorax and lenticula r, dependent, or meniscal opacifications consistent with an effusion. Cardiac. The heart pumps deoxygenated blood to the lungs and oxygenated blood to the tissues. Any impairment of pump function (ie, ischemia, dysrhythmia, valvular dysfunction, septal defects, pericardial fluid) can cause dyspnea. Do not hesitate to initiate relevant cardiac work\u00ad ups when a patient presents with dyspnea. On the physical exam, assess for cardiac murmurs, gallops, and rhythm aberrations. These are important clues to expand the dif\u00ad ferential to cardiac problems. Hemoglobin. There must be enough healthy red blood cells to carry the oxygen to the tissues (ie, no significant anemia), and the hemoglobin must be unadulterated so that oxygen can bind in the lungs and release at the tissues (ie, no CO or CN poisoning). A lack or impairment of hemoglobin can also manifest as dyspnea. Consider a stool guaiac exam if there is any clinical or historical signs of anemia (eg, pallor, cachexia). Replete with a blood transfu\u00ad sion as necessary. Blood volume. Adequate circulating volume is neces\u00ad sary to deliver red blood cells to the lungs and then distrib\u00ad ute them throughout the body. Determine the volume status by assessing vital signs, pulses, mucus membranes, skin turgor, amount of secretions, etc. Blood vessels. Blood must be able to flow freely to all parts of the lungs to pick up oxygen. APE may obstruct blood flow to lung tissue and effect gas exchange, result\u00ad ing in dyspnea. Unfortunately, the physical exam may not reliably assist with this diagnosis, although wheezing may occur. Be espec ially suspicious if there are signs of unilateral leg swelling. Entertain the thought of pulmo\u00ad nary embolism in any patient who is short of breath, especially if the cause of dyspnea is unclear. DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES Diagnostic studies will vary based on the clinical presenta \u00ad tion and physical exam. Laboratory Pulse oximetry is a rapid, noninvasive test that is useful to screen for hypoxia. An >98% predicts is important because an Sa02 of 90% is at the precipitous edge of the oxygen dissociation curve; the patient may drop from 90% to 70% far quicker than from 95% to 90%. An arterial blood gas is the only way to directly measure the Pa02 and the pCO r The pCO 2 is useful in the management of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, or sleep apnea. The complete blood count can help in assessing whether anemia is a cause of dyspnea. A metabolic panel can elucidate the patient's renal status as well as give further information about the patient's acid-base status (bicarbon\u00ad ate). Blood cultures are important in cases of pneumonia. Remember to obtain before starting antibiotics. Electrocardiogram ECG is useful to assess for cardiac ischemia, arrhythmias, and even pericarditis or pericardial effusion. Imaging CXR help to assess the bronchial tree, alveoli, and interstitium. It is also useful for evaluating bony structures, the mediastinum, heart silhouette, and even aberrations of the pleural space. Chest CT can be useful to assess mass lesions, consolidat ions, effusions/e xudates or pulmonary emboli. Soft tissue plain radiograph or CT of the neck can be used in stable patients to determine the presence of epiglottitis, foreign body, or neck abscesses. MEDICAL DECISION MAKING As stated previously, the first goal of a dyspnea work-up is to determine whether the patient is in extreme respira\u00ad tory distress. If the patient is unable to oxygenate, venti\u00ad late, or preserve the airway, the patient must be intubated immediately (question 1). Next, if the patient has signs of a reversible cause of dyspnea, such as asthma, CHF, anaphyla xis, or tension pneumothorax, initiate treat\u00ad ment as soon as possible (question 2). Finally, once the patient is stable, begin the diagnostic work-up (question 3, begin walking down respiratory system anatomically) (Figure 20-1).

Think of monitors as a therapeutic intervention; being aware of the patient's airway and gas exchange status is just as important as intervening. Supplemental 02 can come in multiple forms. Nasal can\u00ad nula can accommodate 2-6 L/min of 0 2 comfortably. This can increase Fi02 by 2-4% for each liter increase. A nome\u00ad breather mask (NBM) can and should go up to 15 L/min of flow; any less leads to drawing back environmental air through the mask, defeating the purpose. NBM cans upply up to 60-70% Fi02 at Fi02 with 15 L/min of flow. Proper 2-handed technique is highly recommended with BMV use when there is an assistant available. Endotracheal intubation is performed if respiratory arrest is imminent. DISPOSITION Admission Patients who are intubated, unstable, or have the potential to become unstable should be admitted to the intensive care unit. Patients who were initially unstable but improved after therapy may be observed on a telemetry unit. .A. Figure 20-2. Patient with nonrebreather mask.

Respiratory distress. In: Emergency Medicine: Study ed. New York, NY: McGraw- Hill, 2011, pp. 465--473. Asthma Matthew C. Tews, DO Key Points Patients with severe asthma exacerbations may have such severe restriction of airflow that they do not exhibit wheezing on examination. Beta-2 agonists are the mainstay of treatment for acute asthma exacerbations. Corticosteroids should be given to patients who do not respond initially to beta-2 agonists and in those with moderate to severe exacerbat ions. INTRODUCTION Asthma is a chronic disorder of the airways that is associated with inflammation, bronchial hyperreact ivity, and intermit\u00ad tent airflow obstruction. The most common chronic disease in childhood, it is also common in the adult population. Presentations of acute asthma account for more than 2 mil\u00ad lion emergency department (ED) visits annually. The causes are multifacto rial, but the pathophysiology is characterized by the release of inflammatory cell mediators that lead to airway smooth muscle constriction, pulmonary vasculature leakage, and mucous gland secretion. Asthma is characterized by progressi ve shortness of breath, variable airflow obstruction, and wheezing. Symp\u00ad toms fluctuate over time, and patients with worsening symptoms due to a trigger are considered to have an \"exac\u00ad erbation\" and require prompt treatment to reverse the airflow obstruction. CLINICAL PRESENTATION An acute asthma presentation is due to a decrease in expi\u00ad ratory airflow and is characterized by progressi ve symp\u00ad toms of shortness of breath, a nonproductive cough, and 89 Peak expiratory flow rate and forced expiratory volume in 1 second are objective measures of the severity of a patient's asthma exacerbation and should be followed serially to measure improvement. wheezing in all lung fields. Symptoms may develop over a period of hours, days, or weeks, but often there is an acute worsening that prompts the patient to seek medical care. The most common trigger of acute asthma is an upper respiratory tract infection, but other factors may lead to sudden worsening of symptoms (Table 21-1). ..... History Obtaining a thorough history may not be possible in an acute asthma exacerbati on. A focused history should be obtained in parallel with initiation of therapy to reverse Table 21-1. Acute asthma triggers. Environmental allergens Exercise-induced Gastroesophageal reflux disease Tobacco smoke Occupational exposures Inhaled irritants Stress-induced Environmental changes (weather) Air pollutants CHAPTER 21 Table 21-2.

Once the patient has improved and is able to provide more history, an attempt should be made to characterize the triggering event, rapidity of symptom onset, and the severity of the exacerbation, which will help guide further treatment and disposition. Characterization of the severity of the patient's underlyi ng asthma may help predict mortality (Table 21-2). Attempting to define the patient's underlying long\u00ad term asthma control does not aid in the management of an acute exacerbation, but will be important to understand when prescribing outpatient therapeutic regimen and follow-up. Patients should be asked about the frequency and duration of their current asthma symptoms and recent beta-agonist usage. Numerous medical conditions can present in a similar fashion to asthma, including pulmonary embolism (PE), pneumonia, congestive heart failure (CHF), acute myocar\u00ad dial infarction (AMI), or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The initial history should focus on dif\u00ad ferentiating asthma from other life-threatening causes of shortness of breath and wheezing. ...... Physical Examination Patients may present with a wide spectrum of severity, from an increase in coughing to obvious respiratory dis\u00ad tress with tachypnea and accessory muscle use. Mental status should be assessed initially because alterations in consciousness may affect the patient's ability to protect their airway. A diminished level of consciousness is an indicator of impending respiratory arrest. The neck should be palpated for tracheal deviation and crepitus, as might occur with spontaneous pneumothorax. The lung exam is variable and demonstrates prolonged expiration with wheezing. However, the severity of the airflow obstruction cannot be gauged by the loudness of the wheezing. The patient who is audibly wheezing may still have good air movement on auscultation, whereas the quiet sounding chest with little air movement is a sign of severe disease because there is not enough airflow to pro\u00ad duce a wheeze. Percussion of the thorax reveals hyper\u00ad resonance due to air trapping. Evaluation of extremity edema will help differentiate asthma from other causes of difficulty breathing. DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES The use of diagnostic studies is limited in the evaluation of a patient with an asthma exacerbation. However, certain diagnostic modalities may be indicated, depending on the clinical situation. ...... Laboratory An arterial blood gas (ABG) may demonstrate an increased pC02 level, indicating ventilatory failure and need for admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). However, the patient's clinical condition is more important than an ABG to predict outcome or the need for intubation. Electrolytes and renal function may be helpful if the patient has comor\u00ad bidities that make metabolic derangements more likely. An elevated white blood cell count may aid in the diagnosis of concomitant pulmonary infection. ..... Imaging Hyperinflation of the lungs is seen in moderate to severe exacerbations and may be reflected on the chest x-ray ( CXR) as an increased anterior-posterior diameter and flattening of the diaphragm muscles. A CXR should be considered in patients not responding to treatment, those with fevers, and those requiring hospitalization or intubation. About 15% of these patients have unsuspected pneumonia, CHF, pneumothorax, or pneumom ediastinum. ...... Electrocardiogram The electrocardiogram (ECG) is not routinely useful and often demonstrates sinus tachycardia. In severe asthma exacerbati ons, a right ventricular strain pattern that nor\u00ad malizes with improvement of airflow may be seen. Dysrhythmias and ischemia may occur in older patients with coexistent heart disease. PROCEDU RES ...... Peak Expiratory Flow Rate Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and peak expi\u00ad ratory flow rate (PEFR) are objective measurements of the degree of airway obstruction that can be performed at the bedside (Figures 21-1 and 21-2). These aid the physician in monitoring the progression of treatment and determination of patient disposition. Predicted values for FEV1 and PEFR are based on the patient's age, sex, and height and compared with a standardized chart or by using the percent of the patient's personal best peak flow. PEFRs <25% predicted indicate a life-threatening exacerbation and require aggressive management. The severity of asthma can be determined by the percentage PEFR and categorized as mild ( > 40-69% will guide further ther\u00ad apy. PEFR values at 1 hour from presentation and beyond are useful to determine need for hospitalization. Either FEV1 or PEFR can be used in acute exacerbations. Figure 21-1. FEV1 meter. Nebulizer The compone nts of a nebulizer treatment include the mouthpiece, medication reservoir, 02 tubing, and \"accor\u00ad dion\" extension tube. The albuterol is placed within the reservoir, and the components are fastened together. The extension tube provides a reservoir of \"trapped\" 0 2 and nebulized albuterol that can be inhaled with each breath. The 02 tubing is hooked up to the green wall 02 port and turned to 6 L/min because the yellow wall port only deliv\u00ad ers air (21% Fi02). The patient holds the nebulizer during the treatment (Figure 21-3). If the patient is unable to hold the treatment, a facemask is used instead. MEDICAL DECISION MAKING The diagnosis of an asthma exacerbation in the ED is relatively straightforward. Any patient who has a history of asthma and presents with wheezin g, cough, and dys\u00ad pnea likely has asthma as the underlying cause. However, there are several situations in which wheezing may not be asthma. Anaphylaxis may present with wheezing, but the patient will often have urticaria and sometimes gastroin\u00ad testinal symptoms. CHF may present with \"cardiac wheezing;' but the patient will often have \"wet\" lungs sounds with rales in the bases, an enlarged heart on CXR, peripheral edema, and jugular venous distention. CHF ASTHMA Figure 21-2. Peak flow meter. can have many underlying causes, but often these indi\u00ad viduals will have underlying heart disease and other comorbidities. The presence of wheezing is common in COPD, but unless the patient has a history of a1-antitrypsin deficienc y, this type of presentation is found in patients with smoking history and who are ..A.Figure 21-3.

Asthma diagnostic algorithm. CHF, congestive heart unit; PE, pulmonar y embolism. typically over the age of 40 years. Patients with pneumo\u00ad nia may have underlying wheezing, but typically have a fever and an infiltrate of CXR. Other diagnoses such as foreign body aspiration, PE, and upper airway obstruc\u00ad tion should also be considered. Stridor is an indicator of upper airway swelling and should be differentiated from wheezing in the lung fields. Once the diagnosis of asthma has been made, the treat\u00ad ment decisions are based on the severity of illness (Figure 21-4). Mild exacerbations can be treated with beta-1 agonists and other supporting medications, and the patient can be dis\u00ad charged. Moderate disease may require further treatments with beta-2 agonists, and the disposition will depend on the response to treatment. Severe presentations will require aggressive management with serial or continuous beta-agonist treatments and can require other medications such as magne\u00ad sium and epinephrine. TREATMENT Patients who present with difficulty breathing should have oxygen applied via nasal cannula or facemask and titrated to keep the level of oxygenation >94%. Cardiac monitoring and IV access should be used in moderate to severe asth\u00ad matics. In conjunction with these, beta-2 agonist therapy should be instituted as the first-line therapy. Patients who are started on beta-2 agonists will still receive oxygen though the nebulized treatment. There are several other therapies that should be considered during an exacerba\u00ad tion, depending on the severity. All medications discussed here are safe to use during pregnancy except epinephrine, which is associated with congenital malformations and premature labor. Beta Agonists. Albuterol is the most commonly used beta-2 agonist agent and is considered first-line by increasing cyclic adenosine monophos phate and relaxing airway smooth muscles. Its onset of action is <5 minutes. The nebulized form consists of albuterol 2.5 mg in 3 mL of saline given every 20 min\u00ad utes x 3, or as a continuous nebulizer for severe asthmatics using albuterol 10 mg over a period of 1 hour. A metered dose inhaler (MDI) delivers albuterol using 2 puffs with a spacer every 20-30 minutes and requires active participa\u00ad tion. A spacer is a chamber that keeps the nebulized drug in suspension to allow a more reliable delivery of the bea agonist to the lungs. Bronchodilation from MDI beta-2 agonists is equivalent to that achieved by nebulization. Parenteral beta agonists include terbutaline 0.25 mg or epinephrine 0.3 mg subcutaneously and can be useful in a life-threatening exacerbation. Avoid in patients with a his\u00ad tory of ischemic heart disease. Corticosteroids. Steroids suppress inflammation, increase the responsiveness ofbeta-2 adrenergic receptors in the airway smooth muscle, and decrease the recruit\u00ad ment and activation of inflamma tory cells. They are indi\u00ad cated in moderate to severe exacerbati ons, patients who fail to respond to initial beta-2 agonist therapy, patients who are on chronic steroids, and for patients who meet the criteria for hospitalization. The clinical effect of corti\u00ad costeroids is not seen immediately, as the peak effect occurs within 6 to 12 hours. Oral or IV routes may be used as both have equal bioavailability. Prednisone 60 mg orally or methylprednisolone (Solu-Medrol) 125 mg IV are equivalent doses. Aerosolized corticosteroids are impor\u00ad tant in chronic treatment and prevention of relapse in asthmatic patients, but they do not play a role in the treat\u00ad ment of acute exacerbati ons. Anticholinergic agents. Ipratropium bromide 0.5 mg via nebulizer can be used in conjunction with beta-2 ago\u00ad nist therapy for moderate to severe bronchodilation. The onset of action is 20 minutes, with a peak effect within 1-6 hours. Other treatments. Magnesium sulfate (MgSO 4) 2 g N over 20 minutes is given for severe asthma exacerbations and works by causing relaxation of smooth muscle. Antibiotics should be given for evidence of pneumonia. Methylxanthines (Theophylline) is not recommen ded in the emergency setting. Heliox is a helium-oxygen (80:20 or 70:30) mixture that has a lower density compared with room air, which allows it to travel through narrow air pas\u00ad sages in a more laminar fashion instead of causing turbu\u00ad lence. This allows increased delivery of oxygen or bronchodilator medications to the alveoli, thereby decreas\u00ad ing the work of breathing. ASTHMA Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) may be used in patients with significant work of breathing and early fatigue. Although its use in COPD and CHF patients has been well established, the use of NPPV in acute asthma needs further evidence to determine the optimal recommenda tions. Intubation with mechanical ventilation may be required for severe acute asthma due to fatigue, persistent hypoxia, worsening hypercarbia, or altered mentation. Ketarnine (2 mg/kg) should be used as the induction agent because it causes bronchodilation. The goal is to maintain adequate oxygenation until the patient responds to therapies and mechanical ventilation can be withdrawn. However, dur\u00ad ing mechanical ventilation patients can develop high lung pressures because they are unable to expire a full breathe. This can lead to barotrauma, pneumothorax, or hypoten\u00ad sion. Several strategies can be used to prevent these com\u00ad plications. Using the largest endotracheal tube possible will decrease airway resistance, and ventilator settings should be set to allow for increases in the expiration time to pre\u00ad vent air trapping. This is done by using a low respiratory rate (permissive hypercarbia) and low tidal volumes (5-7 mL!kg). However, if all other therapies fail, intuba\u00ad tion is necessary. DISPOSITION Admission The decision to admit is based on the combination of patient symptoms, physical examination findings, responses to treatment, 02 saturation, PEFR/FE V1 mea\u00ad surements, and the patient's social limitations to medical care. ICU admission should be considered in patients with severe exacerbations and poor response to treatment judged by altered mentation or continued respiratory dis\u00ad tress. Patients who require continuous albuterol, noninva\u00ad sive ventilation, or intubation sho uld be admitted to the ICU. Floor admission is considered for patients with con\u00ad tinued symptoms and a PEFR/FEV 1 that remains <70% of predicted despite treatment. Discharge It is acceptable to discharge patients without respiratory distress or hypoxia, who have good aeration and dimin\u00ad ished wheezing, with a sustained response after the final albuterol treatment. The goal of the FEV1 or PEFR should be >70% predicted before discharge. Discharged patients should be sent home with an inhaler and spacer and should be instructed on their proper use. Proper technique for use of the MDI is to remove the cap and shake; exhale completely; place mouth on end of spacer; depress inhaler so that 1 puff is delivered into the spacer; start inspiration of medicine from spacer; continue slow, deep inspiration; hold breath 5-10 seconds; and wait 20 second s between each puff. CHAPTER 21 A steroid burst should also be used in patients who had a moderate to severe exacerbation, but who improved enough to go home. This includes a 5-to 10-day course of prednisone at 40-60 mg per day to keep the inflamma\u00ad tory effects of asthma under control. Patients should also have peak flow meters with instructions on a home asthma action plan detailing when to return to the ED based on their symptoms and PEFR. In addition, patients should be given instructions to avoid asthma triggers ( eg, smoking) and be provided with appropr iate follow-up READING Emergency Medicine: ed.

Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease David H. Rosenbaum, MD Key Points Respiratory infections are responsible for most acute exacerbati ons of chronic obstructiv e pulmonary disease (COPD). Beta-adrenergic agonists and anticholinergic drugs remain the primary bronchodilators and are most effec\u00ad tive when used together. Steroids should be given to nearly all patients present\u00ad ing to the emergency department (ED) with COPD INTRODUCTION Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is defined as an illness characterized by irreversible, progressive air\u00ad way obstruction that is associated with inflammatory pul\u00ad monary changes. It is extraordinarily common, and patients with exacerbations of COPD will continue to inundate emergency departments (EDs) in search of respi\u00ad ratory relief. In the United States, COPD is the fourth most common cause of death. The use of the term COPD encompasses patients with chronic bronchitis and emphysema, as well as those patients with asthma who have a component of irreversible airflow obstruct ion. Airflow obstruction is the end result of a process that begins with particulate air pollution exposure (usually from tobacco smoke). Particula te exposure initiates a cascade of events, including airway inflammation and narrowing of the small airways, as well as airway destruction and remodeling in the setting of diminished repair mechanisms and fibrosis, resulting in fixed airflow obstruction and air trapping. Although there are clearly pathophysiologic differences between these groups, their evaluation and treatment is largely the same. 95 exacerbations, and ongoing therapy should be pre\u00ad scribed for those patients who are discharged. Antibiotics are an important adjunct to therapy, although their use should be guided by the patient's signs and symptoms. Noninvasive ventilation is a critical component of therapy that is best used early in the ED course to avoid the need for intubation. A COPD exacerbation is an event characterized by a worsening of the patient's respiratory symptoms beyond the normal day-to-day variation. Typically, this involves one or all of the following: worsening dyspnea, increased sputum as well as a change in the character of sputum, and an increase in the frequency and severity of cough. CLINICAL PRESENTATION ..... History The critical aspects of the history in evaluating patients with dyspnea due to a presumed COPD exacerbation are to establish the patient's baseline function, assess the sever\u00ad ity of the exacerbation, determine a cause, and rule out disorders that may mimic a COPD exacerbati on. Most patients experiencing a COPD exacerbation present with complaints of increased dyspnea in the setting of a recent onset respiratory infection (ie, upper respiratory infec\u00ad tion). As a result, they may complain of a productive or sometimes a nonproductive cough that differs from their baseline cough, rhinorrhea and nasal congestion, and fevers and chills, as well as the constitutional symptoms that frequently accompany systemic illness. Most such CHAPTER 22 patients are chronically ill and often quite frail, so the key to determining the severity of the exacerbation is establish\u00ad ing their baseline health. To do this, it helps to ascertain their oxygen use, their current treatment regimen, their level of function and ability to perform activities of daily living, the frequency of hospitalizations and the timing of their most recent hospitalization, their history of mechan\u00ad ical ventilation, and any comorbid illnesses ( eg, ischemic heart disease and congestive heart failure [CHFJ). Patients who present with symptoms that seem to develop over a long period of time may actually have underlying CHF, whereas patients with abrupt onset symp\u00ad toms may have a pneumothorax (from a ruptured bleb) or a pulmonary embolus (PE). Although acute coronary syn\u00ad drome should also be considered among patients present\u00ad ing with dyspnea, chest tightness is a common complaint among patients with relatively uncomplicated COPD or asthma exacerbations. One helpful historical detail is to discern whether chest tightness is a common feature of past COPD exacerb ations. Physical Examination Patients with COPD exacerbations frequently present with tachypnea, tachycardia, and hypoxia. Because the majority of patients have an underlying respiratory infection, they may also have a fever. Most of what the clinician needs to make a quick assessment can be gathered from vital signs and a quick glance at the patient on entering the room. Patients with severe exacerbations may be sitting upright or leaning forward in the \"tripod\" position with both of their hands planted on their knees. Such patients may be confused and diaphoretic, unable to converse comfortably, and use accessory muscles in the neck and chest wall to help them breathe. Cyanosis is an ominous, but uncommon finding. Patients with less severe exacerbations speak in complete sentences, and the chest exam reveals diffusely diminished breath sounds with wheezing or a prolonged expiratory phase. Patients with emphysema pathology are often thin and frail appearing with a barrel chest. Some patients with prolonged COPD will have evidence of right heart failure including jugular venous distension and lower extremity edema. Finally, although bedside spirometry in the form of a peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) assessment is more use\u00ad ful in asthma, it can be a helpful adjunct to the physical exam of COPD patients because several patients with COPD have a reversible component to their disease. In patients with a known baseline, an easy comparison can be made to deter\u00ad mine the severity of airflow obstruction. Most patients do not recall past PEFR values, but a PEFR <200 L/min suggests a significant component of airflow obstruction. DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES Laboratory Given that patients with COPD often have several comor\u00ad bidities, routine laboratory studies including a complete blood count, electrolytes, and an assessment of renal func\u00ad tion should be ordered in most patients. Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) appears to be tailor made to help differenti\u00ad ate patients with COPD from those with CHF. BNP levels less than 100 pg/mL have a very high negative predictive value for CHF, whereas most patients with CHF have levels >400 pg/mL. However, many patients have values that fall somewhere in between, and discordance between BNP values and patient symptoms occurs often enough that single measurements need to be interpreted carefully. If available, the patient's prior records should be sought out to compare current and past values to determine trends and to establish a baseline. Furthermore, some patients may have a mixture of presenting problems contributing to their dyspnea, so an elevated BNP does not exclude a con\u00ad comitant COPD exacerbation. Cardiac markers such as troponin are frequently ordered, but usually unnecessa ry. Because patients with severe COPD exacerbations often suffer from hypoxia and tachycardia, myocardial oxygen demand is increased, and many patients will have small troponin elevations owing to \"demand ischemia.\" In these patients, serial troponin mea\u00ad surements should be used to help exclude an acute coro\u00ad nary syndrome. D-dimer levels may also be useful in patients with a presumed COPD exacerbation to help exclude PE. Given their comorbidities (CHF, a low flow state), sedentary life\u00ad style, history of smoking, and increased risk for an under\u00ad lying malignan cy, many patients with COPD are at increased risk for PE. Because d-dimer levels are also likely to be falsely elevated in this population, it is wise to limit d-dimer testing to those patients in whom there is a rea\u00ad sonable clinical suspicion of PE (abrupt onset, unilateral leg swelling). Finally, arterial blood gases (ABG) have long been part of the routine evaluation of patients with severe COPD exacerbat ions. ABGs provide (PaCOz), and overall acid-base status (pH). Blood gas readings in patients with significant COPD exacerbations will reveal a primary respiratory aci\u00ad dosis, with elevated C02 levels (>40 mmHg) resulting in a decreased pH ( <7.30). Imaging The chest x-ray (OCR) primarily helps to diagnose pneu\u00ad monia and to exclude alternative conditions such as CHF, a pneumothorax, or significant atelectasis or lobar col\u00ad lapse. The classic findings are hyperinflation and bullous changes (Figure 22-1). Vascular markings and heart size are often decreased in patients with emphysema pathology and increased in patients with chronic bronchitis. Electrocardiogram As with the CXR, electrocardiograms are primarily useful to exclude alternative diagnoses, such as cardiac ischemia. In patients with pulmonary hypertension, peaked P waves CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE F Figure 22-1. Chest radiograph of a patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. in lead II may be present (p puhnonale ), reflecting right atrial enlargement, whereas other patients may have signs of right ventricular hypertrophy (largeR wave in v1 and v2 with prominent S waves in v5 and v6), a right bundle branch block, or right axis deviation. Multifocal atrial tachycardia (MAT) is the classic arrhythmia associated with COPD patients. MAT is an irregularly irregular rhythm, like atrial fibrillation (AF), but there are P waves of differing morphologies before every QRS complex, and it tends to be slower than AF. MEDICAL DECISION MAKING The fundamental challenge in evaluating patients with a presumed COPD exacerbation is to exclude alternative diagnoses that may mimic COPD, such as pneumonia, CHF, PE, pneumothorax, or an acute coronary syndrome. In concert with a CXR, the history and physical is ordinar\u00ad ily sufficient to establish the diagnosis and initiate treat\u00ad ment. Some patients may require more extensive testing, including BNP or d-dimer levels, as well as cardiac mark\u00ad ers. However, most patients present with a self-diagnosis, and there is little ambiguity to the underlying process (Figure 22-2). TREATMENT Patients should receive an IV line, monitor, and oxygen. If a patient appears clinically unstable, with significant tachypnea, accessory muscle use, diaphoresis, and hypoxia, then he or she should be intubated using rapid sequence intubation. In such cases, there is no indication for delaying intubation to obtain a blood gas or CXR or to do any other diagnostic studies. In somewhat more stable patients, a trial of bilevel posi\u00ad tive airway pressure (BPAP) is appropriate. BPAP (often referred to as BiPap, which is a brand name of a specific ventilator) is particularly useful because it actually assists in ventilating patients by delivering a higher inspiratory posi\u00ad tive airway pressure (IPAP) in concert with a lower expira\u00ad tory positive airway pressure (EPAP). The pressure difference between these numbers is what drives ventilation. Typical initial settings are 10/5 (IPAP =10, EPAP = 5). BPAP is most effective when used early in the ED course as a means to avoid intubation, as opposed to being deployed on the verge of intubation as a \"rescue therapY:' However, the only abso\u00ad lute contraindications to its use are respiratory arrest, inabil\u00ad ity to fit the mask, and patient noncompliance. When used appropriately, BPAP use in patients with COPD exacerba\u00ad tions has been shown to decrease intubation, mortality, hospital length of stay, and number of days patients spend in intensive care unit settings. Most patients presenting with a COPD exacerbation do not present in extremis but with moderate to severe respi\u00ad ratory distress and hypoxia. Hypoxemia is the critical life threat in this group of patients and should never be left untreated. Although it's true that PaC02 levels rise in COPD patients to whom oxygen is administered, only a very small fraction of patients experience enough of a rise to cause CNS depression and a depressed respiratory effort (called \"C02 narcosis\" ). However, oxygen should be lim\u00ad ited to only what is needed, with a target saturation (Sa02) of 90-94% (Pa02 of 60-65 mmHg). Venturi masks provide a convenient means of titrating oxygen delivery more accurately. Despite the prevalence of COPD, there are few evi\u00ad dence-based guidelines regarding pharmacologic therapy. However, the conventional triad of short-acting broncho\u00ad dilators, steroids, and antibiotics remains unchanged. In COPD patients, beta-adrenergic agonists (albuterol 2.5 mg in 3 mL of saline) are used in concert with anticholinergic agents (ipratropium bromide 0.5 mg in 3 mL saline) via a nebulizer. Steroids should be given to all patients presenting to the ED with a COPD exacerbat ion. Although steroids are not as effective in COPD patients as in patients with asthma, steroids reduce treatment failures and obstructive symp\u00ad toms, as well as hospital length of stay with an uncertain effect on mortality. In the ED, methylprednisolone is the preferred parenteral agent (Solu-Medrol 125 mg IV), although patients with mild exacerbations can be given 80 mg of prednisone orally. All patients should receive a prescription for 40-60 mg of prednisone to be taken daily for at least 1 week after discharge. Steroid prescriptions do not need to be tapered when prescribed for less than 3 weeks. CHAPTER 22 Suspected COPD exacerbation CXR positive airway pressure; CXR, chest x-ray; ECG, electrocardiogram; ICU, intensive care unit. Antibiotics are frequently given to patients with COPD exacerbations and are indicated for patients with signs of infection such as fever and an increase in sputum produc\u00ad tion or a change in sputum purulence or color. Because most COPD exacerbations are caused by respiratory infec\u00ad tions, most patients receive antibiotics. Although only a subset of patients have bacterial infections, it is effectively impossible to differentiate these patients clinically. Admitted patients should be given ceftriaxone or a respira\u00ad tory tluoroquinolone such as levotloxacin. Discharged patients are candidates for azithromycin (or other macro\u00ad lides), doxycycline, or levotloxacin. DISPOSITION ..... Admission Patients with COPD have very little reserve capacity, are slow to recover from exacerbations, and often have multi\u00ad ple comorbidities. As a result, most patients presenting to CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE the ED with a COPD exacerbation should be admitted to the hospital, including all patients presenting with a respi\u00ad ratory acidosis. ..... Discharge Patients with mild symptoms that respond rapidly to minima l therapy may be amenable to discharge. In such cases, it is helpful to incorpora te the patient into the decision-making process, as they often have a sense of whether they can safely manage their disease as an outpatient.

Tudor, MD Key Points Focus on diagnosing pneumonia early. Identify risk factors that influence treatment decisions (eg, antibiotic choice and disposition). Blood cultures and empiric antibiotics should be started in the emergency department for patients admitted with pneumonia. INTRODUCTION Pneumonia is the sixth leading cause of death and the lead\u00ad ing cause of death from an infectious disease in the United States. The annual incidence of communi ty-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in the United States is 4 million cases, and it results in about 1 million hospitalizations. Most deaths occur in the elderly or immunocomprornised. Pneumonia is an infection of the pulmonary alveoli caused by aspiration, inhalation, or hematogenous seeding of pathogens. An inflammatory response in the alveoli leads to sputum production and a cough, although atypical organisms may produce other fmdings such as mental status changes or wealcness. Pneumonia can be divided into 4 categories based on where it is acquired. CAP occurs in patients who have not been recently in a nursing home or hospitalized. Hospital\u00ad acquired pneumonia (HAP) occurs more than 2 days after hospital admissio n. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) occurs 2-3 days after endotracheal intubation. Health care-associated pneumonia (HCAP) occurs within 90 days of a 2-day hospital stay; in a nursing home resident; within 30 days of receiving N antibiotics, chemo\u00ad therapy, or wound care, or after a hospital or hemodialysis clinic visit; or in any patient in contact with a multidrug\u00ad resistant pathogen. Tuberculosis should be considered for patients with human immunodeficiency virus or other significant risk factors to avoid further spread. In about half of cases of pneumonia, the etiology will not be determined. In those whose cause can deter\u00ad S. pneumoni ae account for about 17%. HCAP may also be due to other agents, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterobacter species. In patients with diminished mental status, aspiration of a foreign substance (eg, gastric con\u00ad tents) into the lungs leads to a pneumonitis and a polymi\u00ad crobial infection. Determining risk factors, such as comorbidities, alcohol abuse, and the patient's environ\u00ad ment, can help guide therapies and disposition decisions. CLINICAL PRESENTATION History In most adults and adolescents, the diagnosis of pneumo\u00ad nia can be made by history and physical examination alone. Patients will typically complain of a cough produc\u00ad tive of purulent sputum, fevers, shortness of breath, 100 fatigue, and pleuritic chest pain. Patients at the extremes of age (children and the elderly) and immunocompromised patients often present with atypical symptoms. In many cases, they present with mental status changes or deteriora\u00ad tion of baseline function alone. Be sure to ask about risk factors for pulmonary tuber\u00ad culosis (TB) (history of TB, exposure to TB, persistent weight loss, night sweats, hemoptysis, incarceration, human immuno deficiency virus [HIV]/acquired immune deficiency syndrome [AIDS], homelessness, alcohol abuse, immigration from a high-risk area) . ..... Physical Examination Vital sign changes can include tachycardia, hypotension, increased respiratory rate, or decreased pulse oximetry. These can be late findings and may not be present. On examination, patients may have coarse rales or rhonchi in the involved seg\u00ad ments. Other evidence of pulmonary consolidation includes decreased breath sounds, dullness to percussion, egophon y, and tactile fremitus. Test for egophony by asking the patient to say \"ee\" while you are auscultating. Normally, a muffled long E sound is heard. When \"ee\" is heard as \"ay;' egophony is present and indicates an underlying consolidation. Tactile fremitus refers to an increase in the palpable vibration trans\u00ad mitted through the bronchopulmonary system to the chest wall when a patient speaks. Increased tactile fremitus suggests an underlying consolidation. DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES ..... Laboratory In ambulatory, mildly symptomatic patients who are other\u00ad wise healthy, no testing may be indicated. The diagnosis of pneumonia is often clinical, but laboratory studies may aid in the diagnosis or treatment decisions. There is often an elevated white blood cell count in patients with bacterial pneumonia. Obtain a chemistry panel in ill-appearing patients to rule out metabolic derangements. For patients who are hospitalized with pneumonia, obtain blood cultures before initiating antibiotics (if possible). Do not delay anti\u00ad biotics for critically ill patients. More than 25o/o of hospital\u00ad ized patients with pneumonia have bacteremia. Sputum Gram stain and cultures are rarely obtained in the emer\u00ad gency department (ED), but can help determine the bacte\u00ad rial pathogen and narrow specific antimicrobial therapy. ..... Imaging Chest x-ray (CXR) may demonstrate evidence of pneumo\u00ad nia, but cannot be relied on to completely exclude pneumo\u00ad nia (especially in immunocompromised patients). Typical findings on CXR include lobar consolidation, segmental subsegmental infiltrates, or is with anaerobic, aerobic gram-negative bacilli, and mycobacterial or fungal infections (Figure 23-2). Radiologic findings are nonspecific for PNEUMONIA .A Figure 23-1. Chest radiograph showing pneumonia in the right middle lobe. .A Figure 23-2. Chest radiograph of a patient with tuberculosis.

Also, radiographic signs of pneumonia can persist well after clinical resolution. MEDICAL DECISION MAKING The differential diagnosis of patients with a cough and CXR abnormality includes pulmona ry embolism, conges\u00ad tive heart failure, lung cancer, connective tissue disorders, CHAPTER 23 Clinical suspicion of pneumonia pneumoni a Consider discharge to home Search for alternative diagnosis or treat for pneumonia presumptively, based on clinical findings Figure 23-3. Pneumonia diagnostic algorithm. CXR, chest x-ray. granulomatous disease, fungal infections, and chemical or hypersensitivity pneumonitis. The radiographic signs of pneumonia vary, so it is difficult to predict the causative organisms by the radiographic appearance alone. The clinical presentation, in conjunction with CXR findings, will aid in treatment decisions (Figure 23-3). TREATMENT Start with supplemental oxygen by nasal cannula or face mask if the patient is short of breath or hypoxic. For patients with severe respiratory distress or shock, mechan\u00ad ical ventilation can decrease the work of breathing and can be lifesaving. Empiric antibiotics can be started based on the likely pathogens and overall clinical picture. Timely administ ra\u00ad tion of antibiotics ( <6 hours from presentation) is associ\u00ad ated with improved outcomes for patients requiring hospital admission. The antibiotic recommendations listed are representative of recommended treatments, but are not comprehensive (Table 23-1). Other antibiotic regimens may also be effective, and the clinician should consider local resistance patterns and allergies. Consider whether or not your patient requires measures to prevent transmission of disease. These include droplet and airborne precautions. When the pathogen has not been identified, err on the side of caution and apply the precau\u00ad tion based on the suspected pathogen. These measures PNEUMONIA Table 23-1. Recommended antibiotic regimens to treat pneumonia. Outpatients age <60 years and otherwise Consider azithromycin (500 mg PO for 1 day, then 250 mg PO for 4 days) or levofloxacin (750 mg healthy PO daily for 14 days) or doxycycline (100 mg PO bid for 14 days) Outpatients age >60 years or with comorbidities (without HCAP} Consider amoxicillin\u00b7clavulanate (2 g PO bid for 14 days) plus azithromycin or levofloxacin (750 mg PO daily for 14 days) Admitted with CAP Third-generation cephalosporin (ceftriaxone 1 g IV daily) and a macrolide (azithromycin 500 mg IV daily} Aspiration pneumonia Clindamycin (600 mg IV every 8 hours) or ampicillin\u00b7sulbactam (3 g IV every 12 hours) or moxifloxacin ( 400 mg IV daily) HAP, HCAP, or neutropenia beta\u00b7lactam (eg, Zosyn 4.5 g 6 hours}, an anti\u00b7MRSA antibiotic (vancomycin 15 mg/kg IV every 12 hours) and a fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin 750 mg IV every 8 hours) HIV/AIDS suspected of PCP pneumonia Add trimethopri m/sulfamethoxazole (5 mg/kg of the trimethoprim component IV every 8 hours) and prednisone 40 mg PO 30 minutes before antibiotics when the p02 is <70 mmHg AIDS, acquired Pneumo cystis corinii pneumonia. should be performed early in the ED visit (preferably from triage) and continue when the patient is admitted. ...... Droplet Precautions Droplets are particles >5 microns that travel in the air but only remain floating for a very limited time. Transmission occurs usually within 3 feet of the patient. Common pathogens transmitted by the droplet route include respi\u00ad ratory viruses influenza, parainfluenza, and adenovi\u00ad rus), Bordetella pertussis, Neisseria meningitides (in the 24 hours of treatmen t), Mycoplasma pneumoni ae, rubella, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). In addition to standard precautions, healthcare work\u00ad ers should wear a mask when working within 6 feet of the patient. Respirator masks and air handling systems are not necessary. The door to the patient's room doesn't have to be closed (as transmission is limited to 3 feet), but doing so can help remind health care workers they are entering a room with droplet precautions. If a single patient room is not available, the patient should be more than 3 feet away from other patients and a curtain drawn between them. ...... Airborne Precautions Airborne droplets are <5 microns and can remain sus\u00ad pended in the air for extended periods of time. Human to human transmission usually occurs via inhalation. The most common pathogen transmitted via the airborne route is TB. Other common pathogens include measles, varicella (until lesions are crusted over), disseminated herpes, and SARS (though predomina ntly transmitted via droplet). Health care workers should place patients in airborne infection isolation rooms (AIIR). These are negative pres\u00ad sure rooms with a minimum of 6-12 air changes per hour and a door that can be closed. When entering the room, health care workers need to wear respirator masks for which the efficacy of the seal formed is evaluated. These N-95 respirator masks remove 95% of droplets. Once the patient vacates the room, the room will need to be open for 1 hour for enough air exchanges to occur to remove any offending organism. DISPOSITION ...... Admission There are several clinical guidelines (Pneumonia Severity Index or CURB-65) to help risk-stratify patients and aid in the disposition. These guidelines consider risk factors asso\u00ad ciated with increased morbidity and mortality. Risk factors include elderly or nursing home residents, the presence of com or bid disease (congestive heart failure, cancer, liver disease, stroke, chronic renal disease), altered mental sta\u00ad tus, respiratory rate >30 these risk factors and clinical guidelines should be considered in deciding to admit a patient, other factors such as the social situation, ability to follow-up, and other medical conditions may also play a role in the decision to admit the patient. Consider infection control measures, as outlined previousl y, on all admitted patients. ...... Discharge Patients without a complicated course or risk factors and who have a good social situation may be discharged home with appropriate follow-up.

Ann Emerg Med. 2009;54:704-731. Pneumothorax Michelle Sergei, MD Brian Krieger, MD Key Points Tension pneumothorax is a clinical diagnosis that should be considered in any patient with shock and respiratory distress. Treatment should not be delayed for rad iologic confirmation. Appropriate treatment of a tension pneumothorax is a needle thoracostomy, followed by tube thoracostomy. INTRODUCTION Pneumothorax is an accumulation of air within the pleural space. Spontaneous pneumothorax is acquired in the absence of trauma. A primary spontaneous pneumothorax is found in patients without underlying pulmonary pathol\u00ad ogy. A secondary spontaneous pneumothorax is found in patients with underlying lung disease and damage to the alveolar-pleural barrier (most commonly seen with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD] or asthma). Spontaneous primary pneumothoraces have the greatest incidence of occurrence in young adults. They are more common in males than females (6:1), greater height-weight ratios, and smokers. Smoking is the most important modifiable risk factor, with a lifetime risk of 12% compared with 0.1 o/o in nonsmo kers. Spontaneous secondary pneumothoraces are most common in patients older than 40 years with COPD. Recurrence rates range from 30-45%. The parietal pleura lines the thoracic cavity and closely adheres to the visceral pleura, which surrounds the lungs. The potential area between these 2 layers is known as the pleural space. If air accumulates within this potential space, the pressure causes the thoracic cavity to expand and the lung to collapse, creating a pneumothorax. Unless a pneumothorax is spontaneous , small ( <20%), minimally symptomatic, and primary, definitive treatment is tube thoracostomy . Secondary spontaneous pneumothoraces are the result of a damaged alveolar-pleural barrier or underlying lung problems that cause an increase in intrabronchial pres\u00ad sures. Tension pneumothoraces occur when air enters the pleural space on inspiration but cannot escape on expira\u00ad tion (known as ball-valve effect). There is progressive accumulation of air in the pleural space, resulting in col\u00ad lapse of the affected lung and shift of the mediastinal structures to the opposite side. This ultimately causes compression of the contralateral lung, impairment of venous return, decreased cardiac output, and signs of car\u00ad diovascular collapse requiring immediate intervention with a needle thoracostomy. CLINICAL PRESENTATION History Symptoms can vary, but are predicated on the pneumotho \u00ad rax size, rate of formation, and cardiorespiratory reserve. A typical history includes a sudden onset of ipsilateral pleu\u00ad ritic chest pain and/or dyspnea with a nonprod uctive cough. Patients, however, range from clinically silent to agitated, restless, altered mental status, and/or cardiac arrest if severe respiratory compromise is present. 105 CHAPTER 24 ..... Physical Examination The physical examination can range from unremarkable to a patient in shock. Vital signs typically include a mild tachycardia and tachypnea, although only 5% of patients have a respiratory rate greater than 24. Findings on the lung examination may be subtle if there is a small pneumo\u00ad thorax. Decreased breath sounds occur in 85%, whereas hyperresonance to percussion occurs in less than 33%. Patients with tension pneumothorax present in extremis with hypotension, cyanosis, severe respiratory distress, and tracheal deviation to the contralateral side. DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES ..... Laboratory Laboratory studies do not assist in making the diagnosis of pneumothorax, but may be helpful in evaluating other causes of the patient's symptoms. .... Imaging A standard inspiratory posteroanterior chest x-ray (CXR) is obtained initially. The edge of the collapsed lung runs parallel to the chest wall, and lung markings cannot be identified beyond that border (Figure 24-1). The size of the pneumothorax can be roughly estimated as a percentage with each centimeter equal to approximately 10% decreased lung volume. Pneumothoraces > 2 em are considered large. If a pneumot horax is not seen on the film, but still highly suspected, an expiratory , lateral, and/or decubitus film may help. The intrapulmonary pressure is decreased during expiration, causing decreased lung volumes and a relative increase in the size of the pneumothorax. Computed Figure 24-1. Complete pneumothorax of the left lung. tomography (CT) has higher sensitivity for the detection of pneumothoraces, especially in the supine patient. CT also has high specificity in differentiating bullae from pneumot horaces. Patients with pneumothoraces identified solely on a CT, however, uncommonly require treatment. Ultrasonography is another modality to detect a pneumo\u00ad thorax that capitalizes on changes in artifact when com\u00ad paring normal lung with collapsed lung. The utility of ultrasound, however, is vastly tied to the ability of the operator. PROCEDURES Needle decompression is performed if a tension pneumo\u00ad thorax is suspected. Using a long 14-or 16-gauge angio\u00ad catheter, puncture the second intercostal space at the mid-clavicular line on the affected side. A gush of air will be heard, as the hemodynamics improve. Ultimately, a tube thoracostomy must be placed. Tube thoracostomy is dis\u00ad cussed in detail in Chapter 7. Complications include re-expansion pulmonary edema, extrapleural placement, intraparenchym al placement, empyema, and penetration of solid organs. MEDICAL DECISION MAKING Suspicion for a pneumothorax begins with the history and physical examination. If a pneumothorax is suspected, the vital signs are critical in the medical decision making. Stable vital signs allow time for chest radiographs, con\u00ad firming the diagnosis. Pneumothorax with hypotension equates to a tension pneumothorax requiring needle tho\u00ad racostomy followed immediately by tube thoracostomy (Figure 24-2). TREATMENT Oxygen is a mainstay of treatment. Reabsorption, normally occurring at a rate of 1-2% per day, is hastened with 02 (3-4 L/min increases the rate 4-fold). Tube thoracostomy is indicated in patients with secondary spontaneous pneu\u00ad mothoraces; those greater than 20% in size or expanding pneumothoraces; bilateral or tension pneumothoraces; those associated with significant symptoms; or in patients requiring posi tive pressure ventilation or air transport. Small ( <20%) pneumothoraces can be observed and the patient can be discharged if there is no progression seen on a CXR repeated after 6 hours. Failure rates, defined by the eventual need for tube thoracostom y, with observa\u00ad tion alone are as high as 40%. Catheter aspiration reduces a moderate to large pneu\u00ad mothorax to a small one that will resolve on its own. A CXR is needed immediately after aspiration and again 6 hours later to verify successful aspiration and to ensure that there is no reaccumulation of air. Catheter aspiration decreases length of stay without affecting mortality or complications.

A trend toward discharging patients after insertion of a small-bore catheter with a small 1-way valve attached (ie, Heimlich valve) has emerged. After consul\u00ad tation with a specialist (cardiothoracic surgeon or pill\u00ad monologi st), discharge is either completed after an observation period or immediately with a next-day follow-up appointment. DISPOSITION Admission If a chest tube is inserted, patients are admitted to the hos\u00ad pital. The chest tube must be attached to a water seal and vacuum device (Pleur-Evac). Patient with small (<20%) traumatic pneumothoraces that are managed conserva \u00ad tively are usually admitted for observation. Discharge If the pneumothorax is small ( <20%) and patients are healthy, reliable, and minimally symptomatic, they may be observed. A second CXR 6 hours later should be performed to ensure that there has been no change in the size of the pneumothor ax before discharge. Close follow\u00ad up with a specialist should be arranged. Patients must avoid air travel until the pneumot horax shows complete resolution. SUGGESTED READING Humphries Emergency Medicine: Study ed. New York, NY: McGraw\u00ad Hill, 2011, pp. 500-504.

Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2011;1:CD004479. Pulmonary Embolism Harsh Sule, MD Key Points Consider pulmonary embolism (PE) in patients with complaints of dyspnea, chest pain, hemoptysis, or syncope. Dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, or tachypnea is present in 92% of patients with PE. INTRODUCTION Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a potentially life-threatening condition associated with a partial or complete obstruc\u00ad tion of the pulmonary artery caused by a thrombus that b.reaks off from a peripheral vein, migrates via the right s1de of the heart, and lodges in the pulmonary artery circulati on. About 90% of emboli originate from venous thrombi in the lower extremities and pelvis. The presence of emboli in the pulmonary vasculature blocks normal blood flow to the lung and increases pulmonary resis\u00ad tance. This, in turn, increases pulmonary artery pressure and right ventricular pressure. When greater than 50% of the vasculature is occluded, the patient experiences sig\u00ad nificant pulmona ry hypertension and acute cor pulmo\u00ad nale. Undetected, this leads to long-term morbidity and death. PE is the third most common cause of death from cardiovascular disease, with approximately 650,000 cases of PE occurring per year in the United States. The diagnosis is frequently missed, with 30% of cases diag\u00ad nosed antemortem. Massive PE occurs in only 5% of cases, but has an associated mortality rate of 40%. Overall, mortality is 3-10% if treated and 15-30% if untreated. If PE is considered in the differential, use clinical deci\u00ad sion rules (PERC, Wells, Geneva) to help guide decisions regarding the patient work-up. Consider thrombolytics in hemodynamic ally unstable patients with confirmed PE. CLINICAL PRESENTATION History The classic triad of chest pain, dyspnea, and hemoptysis is present in fewer than 20% of patients. Dyspnea is the most common symptom associated with PE, occurring in up to 80% of confirmed cases, with 67% experiencing rapid onset of shortness of breath. Pleuritic chest pain is present in 52% of patients, but substernal chest pain is present in <20%. Other symptoms include fainting, cough, palpita\u00ad tions, hemoptysis, and calf/thigh pain or swelling. Risk factors for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and PE are inherited or acquired and continue to follow Virchow's triad described in 1856: venous stasis (eg, bed rest >48 hours, long-distance auto recent hospitalizatio n), ( eg, malignan C deficienc y), and vascular injury (eg, trauma, recent surgery, central lines, IV drug use). Ninety-four percent of all patients with PE have one or more risk factors. Physical Examination Tachypnea ( 20/min) is one of the most sensitive clinical findings, with a prevalence of 70% in PE confirmed cases. 108 PULMONARY EMBOLISM Tachycardia (100/min) has a prevalence of 26%. Pulse oximetry is frequently normal in patients with a PE and cannot be used to exclude the diagnosis. Lung examination may be clear or may reveal rales, whereas extremity exami\u00ad nation is useful only if signs of a DVT are present. Rectal examination for blood is useful to assess bleeding risk if anticoagulation becomes necessary. DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES ...... Laboratory Although many patients with PE are hypoxic (PaO 2 < 80 mmHg), this is not universally true. The A-a gradient can be used as an indirect measure of ventilation\u00ad perfusion V/Q abnormalities, although 15% of patients with PE have a normal A-a gradient. D-dimer is a fibrin degradation product that circulates in a patient with a dissolving fibrin thrombus. It is found in the serum within 1 hour and stops circulating after 7 days. Multiple d-dimer tests exist with varying sensitivi\u00ad ties and specificities, but a negative d-dimer test (enzyme\u00ad linked immunos orbent assay or turbidimetric) in patients with a low pretest probability implies a risk for PE of less than 1%. Troponin and brain natriuretic peptide have been stud\u00ad ied in the context of PE, and at this time their value may be limited to risk stratification only. ...... Electrocardiogram An electrocardiogram (ECG) is useful to rule out a primary cardiac etiology and is neither specific nor sensitive for PE. Approximately 30% of patients with PE have a normal ECG. Sinus tachycardia is present in up to 36% of patients with PE. The classic S1Q3T3 combination of findings (S wave in lead I, Q wave in lead III, and T wave inversion in lead III) is present in <20% of patient with confirmed PE. Right-sided heart strain seen as T-wave inversions in the anterior leads (v1-v4) may be present in massive PE. ..... Imaging A chest x-ray (OCR) is useful in evaluating other causes of the symptoms. In PE, CXR is nonspec ific and nondiagnos\u00ad tic, with a normal radiograph reported in up to 24% of patients. Common abnormalities seen in patients with PE include atelectasis, parenchymal abnormalities, (sensitivity 22% and specificity 82%). Westermarck's sign is dilatation of pulmonary vessels proximal to the PE with collapse of distal vessels 12% and specificity 97%). Chest CT angiography ( CTA) is the accepted diagnostic modality of choice (Figure 25-1). It is rapid and sensitive for detecting proximal PEs. The clinical outcome after a negative CTA is favorable, and the likelihood for subsequent .6. Figure 25-1. Computed tomography angiography with pulmonary embolism. thromboembolic events is extremely low. CTA is also use\u00ad ful to identify alternate diagnoses. V/Q lung scan results are interpreted as normal, low, intermediate, or high probability for PE. A normal scan effectively rules out PE with a negative predictive value of 97%. However, this test is infrequently used today except when specific contraindications to a CTA exist. Although previously favored for pregnant patients, guidelines now typically recommend CTA in pregnant patients too . Lower extremity duplex ultrasound may be used to diagnose DVT in a patient with a high clinical suspicion of PE and a negative CTA. MEDICAL DECISION MAKING The diagnosis of PE can be elusive, and with growing con\u00ad cerns of excessive testing and resultant radiation, the clini\u00ad cian must determine not only how to work up the patient, but also which patients need to be worked up. Although experience and clinical gestalt may reproduce the output of some decision rules, it is felt that the use of clinical predic\u00ad tion rules is warranted. The Pulmona ry Embolism Rule-Out Criteria (PERC rule) was prospectively derived and validated to identify very low-risk patients who do not require diagnostic test\u00ad ing (Table 25-1). When there is a low clinical gestalt for PE and all 8 criteria are met (with no contrain dications for use of the rule ), then patients are determined to be very low risk for PE with a 45-day incidence of venous thromboembolism or death of less than 2%. In these patients, no further work-up for PE is recommended. If the PERC rule does not apply, a patient's pretest probability for PE should be calculated using 1 of 2 rules (Geneva or Wells) that utilize findings from the history and physical examination (Box 25-1 and Table 25-2). The results risk-stratify the patient into two groups-PE unlikely or PE likely. Both simplified revised Geneva and CHAPTER 25 Table 25-1. The Pulmonary Embolism Rule Out Criteria (PERC) for excluding PE without testing. Age <50 years Pulse <1 00 bpm Pulse oximetry >94% No unilateral leg swelling No hemoptysis No recent surgery /trauma No oral hormone use No prior venous thromboembolism If there is a low clinical gestalt pretest probability for PE AND all 8 criteria are fulfilled, sensitivit y is 97.4%. PERC rule may not be applied if concurrent beta-blocker use, transient tachycardia, thrombophilia, strong family history of thrombosis , patient with an amputation, massively obese (leg swelling cannot be reliably assessed), or baseline hypoxemia (<95% long-term).

Clinical criteria to prevent unnecessary diagnostic testing in emergency department patients with suspected pulmo\u00ad nary embolism. }ouranal of thrombosi s and haemostasis. 2004;2(8 ):1247-55. Wells rules have been shown to be comparable. In patients with an \"unlikely\" pretest probability of PE, a d-dimer should be ordered. If the d-dimer is negative, no further testing is required. If the d-dimer is positive, the clinician proceeds to chest CTA to adequately exclude PE. In Box 25-1. Geneva Score (Revised and Simplified). The Geneva score is predictive for PE.

Derivation of a simple clinical model to categorize patient's probability of pul\u00ad monary embolism: increasing the PE, CTA is obtained (Figure 25-2). TREATMENT Oxygen should be administered as needed. Endotracheal intubation may be necessary for cases of refractory hypoxia. Vasopressors such as norepinephrine (10 meg/min) are indicated in patients with hypotension. Large IV fluid boluses should be avoided. Fluids can exacerbate already elevated right ventricular pressures, leading to further compromise of left ventricular outflow and shock. Anticoagulation is the mainstay of treatment and pre\u00ad vents additional thrombi from forming, but does not dis\u00ad solve existing clot. Endogenous fibrinolysis and clot resolution typically occurs over weeks to months, but may be incomplete. Short-term therapy with unfractionated heparin (5,000 unit or 80 IU/kg or fondaparinux is used as a bridge to long-term therapy with a vitamin K antagonist such as war\u00ad farin. The target international normalized ratio for warfarin administration is 2.0-3.0. Length of treatment may be lim\u00ad ited to 3 months if a clear precipitant (transient or reversible) is identified, but otherwise long-term treatment is recom\u00ad mended as long as the benefits outweigh the risks. Newer medications such as direct thrombin inhibitors are promising alternatives to warfarin, but are still being studied. An infe\u00ad rior vena cava filter is to anticoagulation ( eg, active gastrointestinal bleeding) therapy. PULMONARY EMBOLISM Suspect PE: dyspnea, pleuritic cated in hemodynamically unstable patients with con\u00ad firmed PE, when the benefits of treatment outweigh the risks of life-threatening bleeding complications (13% risk of major hemorrhag e). DISPOSITION ..... Admission Recent studies seem to indicate that it may be possible to manage patients with confirmed PE and low-risk findings as outpatients. However, pending further data, the current standard remains admission for all patients with newly diagnosed PE. Patients with refractory hypoxia or cardio\u00ad vascular dysfunction should be admitted to an intensive care setting. ..... Discharge Patients with a clear alternative diagnosis may be dis\u00ad charged based on the severity and appropriate manage\u00ad ment of the alternate diagnosis.

Gordon, MD Key Points A primary survey should be conducted to rapidly screen for vascular catastrophes, abdominal sepsis, or perforated viscus. Appendicitis should always be on the differential diag\u00ad nosis for acute abdominal pain. Females of childbearing age with abdominal pain are pre\u00ad sumed to have an ectopic pregnancy until proven otherwise. INTRODUCTION Abdominal pain is a common presenting complaint and represents up to 10% of all emergency department (ED) visits. Although the etiology of abdominal pain frequently goes undiagn osed, the role of the emergency phy sician is to first identify and treat any immedia te life-or organ\u00ad threatening conditions. Imminent causes of abdominal pain that need to be promptly diagnosed are those driven by a vascular event, infectious process, or perforated vis\u00ad cous Other disease pro\u00ad cesses may not pose an immediate threat to the patient but should be diagnosed before discharge, as delays in treat\u00ad ment can result in patient morbidity ( eg, appendicitis, pelvic inflammatory disease). Abdominal pain can be classified as visceral, parietal, or referred in origin. Depending on the disease process, pain may begin as visceral and become parietal, as in the stretching and subsequent rupture of a hollow viscus. Visceral pain occurs with the stretching of nerve fibers in the walls of hollow organs or the capsules of solid organs. The location of pain is not well localized, but often has an embryologic basis that aids in determining the diagnosis. Epigastric pain occurs in patients with stretching of fore\u00ad gut organs (stomach to duodenum, including biliary tree Older and immunocompromised patients may have an atypical presentation of disease. The white blood cell count is an unreliable predictor of disease and should not be used in isolation to confirm or exclude a critical diagnosis. and pancreas ). Periumbilical pain represents pathology of midgut organs (distal duodenum to transverse colon). Suprapubic pain is due to problems of the hindgut organs (distal transverse colon, rectum, and urogenital tract). Parietal pain is due to irritation of the parietal peritoneum. The patient is more readily able to localize the pain ( eg, left lower quadrant pain in diverticul itis), but when the entire peritoneal cavity is involved, the pain is diffuse. Referred pain is defined as pain experienced at a site distant from its source. Its anatomic basis lies in afferent nerves from dif\u00ad ferent locations sharing the same spinal cord segment. Abdominal pain may be referred from organs above the diaphragm (eg, myocardial infarction causing epigastric pain). Alternatively, abdominal pathology may refer pain to sites above the diaphragm (eg, splenic rupture causing shoulder pain). Older and immunocompromised patients warrant spe\u00ad cial consideration as higher risk groups. Older patients have a greater incidence of vascular catastrophes and surgi\u00ad cal disease, with as high as 40% of patients older than 65 years requiring operative intervention (Table 26-1). Compared with younger counterparts, older patients are more likely to have atypical presentations, have nonspecific symptoms, and present later in the disease course. In addi\u00ad tion to being vulnerable to opportunistic pathogens, irnmunocompromised patients may not develop peritoneal 112 ACUTE ABDOMI NAL PAIN Table 26-1.

For both these popula\u00ad tions, a low threshold must be maintained to pursue criti\u00ad cal diagnoses. CLINICAL PRESENTATION ..... History A thoughtful history is important in obtaining an accu\u00ad rate diagnosis, but some specific historical elements can lead to the rapid development of a targeted differential. While keeping in mind that patients may have an atypi\u00ad cal presentation of disease, the location of the pain, the nature of the pain at onset, and how the pain behaves since onset can help efficiently discrimi nate between dif\u00ad ferent diagnostic considerations (Figure 26-1). Pain that is sudden and severe at onset is often associated with the rupture of a blood vessel or hollow viscus ( eg, ruptured AAA, perforated peptic ulcer), In contrast, inflamma tory conditions tend to have a more insidious onset, as is seen with appendicitis. Pain whose progression is colicky in nature is suggestive of peristaltic activity in the setting of an obstructed lumen ( eg, ureteral, biliary, intestinal colic). The manner in which the pain radiates can suggest a specific disease. Pain radiating to the back is often seen with pancreatitis. Pain radiating to the right infrascapular region is associated with biliary tract disorders. Pain that radiates to the groin may indicate a ruptured aortic aneu\u00ad rysm or nephrolithiasis. Associated symptoms involving the gastrointestinal, genitourin ary, and cardiopulmonary systems should be obtained. The clinician, however, must keep a broad dif\u00ad ferential as the same symptom can be seen across many disease processes. Nausea and vomiting are nonspecific symptoms, although it is worthwhile noting the temporal relationship between them. Surgical causes of abdominal pain classically present with pain preceding vomiting, whereas the reverse is often seen with medical etiologies. The clinician must be cautious in using diarrhea as conclu\u00ad sive evidence of gastroenteritis, as it can also be seen with appendicitis, diverticulitis, and partial small bowel o bstruc\u00ad such suggestive of a urinary tract infection; however, they can also be caused by appendicitis or pelvic abscess. Hematuria should raise concern for nephrolithiasis or a malignancy in the genitourinary tract. Vaginal bleeding and discharge are important to elicit in assessing for ecto\u00ad pic pregnancy and pelvic inflammatory disease. As pneu\u00ad monia, pulmonary embolism, and acute coronary syndrome can all present with abdominal pain, the pres\u00ad ence of cough, chest pain, and shortness of breath should be ascertained. A thorough past medical/surgical history, medications, allergies, and social history should also be obtained. The existence of known coronary artery or cerebrovascular disease should raise suspicion for vascular disease of the abdomen. Corticosteroids and immunosu ppressants should alert the clinician that the patient may not present with typical symptoms or exam findings. Knowledge of anticoagulants is critical in constructing the differential diagnosis as well as making sure reversal is not needed before any operative intervention. Heavy alcohol use raises the possibility of hepatitis or pancreatitis. ..... Physical Examination Vital signs should be readily noted, with tachycardia and/ or hypotension raising immediate concern for the presence of shock. Hemodynamic instability, in conjunction with fever and warm skin, points toward septic shock; the pres\u00ad ence of cold and clammy skin suggests hypovolemic shock. The general appearance of the patient can provide important diagnostic informat ion. The inability to lie still or find a position of comfort is seen with ureteral colic, ovarian torsion, and mesenteric ischemia. Patients with peritonitis-whose pain is worsened with movement\u00ad prefer to lie still. A thorough abdominal examination should be per\u00ad formed, starting with visual inspection, followed by aus\u00ad cultation, and then palpation. Inspection may reveal abdominal distention or surgical scars from surgeries not initially volunteered by the patient. The presence of hyper\u00ad active high-pitched bowel sounds may signify a small bowel obstruction. Palpation should begin with a non\u00ad tender location followed by the tender quadrants. One should look for the presence of guarding (contraction of the abdominal wall musculature) as well as facial grimac\u00ad ing. Rebound tenderness lacks sensitivity or specificity as a finding of peritonitis. A more specific marker is \"cough pain.\" The patient is asked to cough, and the examiner looks for signs of pain such as flinching, grimacing, or CHAPTER 26 Right Upper Quadrant Left Upper Quadrant Epigastric l mesenteric ischemia Right mesenteric ischemia Peritonitis Sickle cell crisis Diabetic ketoacidosis Black widow spider bite AAA = abdominal aortic aneurysm; ACS = acute coronary syndrome; IBD = inflamma tory bowel disease; Causes of abdominal pain based on location. grabbing the abdomen. Children can be asked to jump up and down as an indirect means of inciting peritoneal irri\u00ad tation. In addition to signs of peritonitis, the physician should examine for the presence of a pulsatile mass consis\u00ad tent with an aortic aneurysm. A pelvic exam should be performed in women with lower or undifferentiated abdominal pain to help sepa\u00ad rate a pelvic from abdominal source. Cervical motion tenderness can be found with appendicitis, but the pres\u00ad ence of a cervical mucopuru lent discharge supports the diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease. A genitourinary exam (GU) in males should be performed to evaluate for testicular disease, prostatitis, and hernias. Adolescents with testicular torsion may only complain of abdominal pain making a systematic GU exam paramount to timely diagnosis. DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES ...... Laboratory Complete blood count. Although leukocytosis may alert the physician that the patient is sicker than initially perceived, the white blood cell count (WBC) must be used with caution. A normal WBC does not exclude serious infection, and an elevated WBC can be seen in many benign conditions. Overall, the WBC is a poor predictor of disease and should not replace clinical judgment. Electrolytes and glucose. It is important to correct any electrolyte derangement that can occur in the setting of fluid losses from excessive vomiting or diarrhea. Conversely, electrolyte or glucose derangement may be the cause of abdominal pain, as seen in hypercalcemia and diabetic ketoacidosis. Blood urea nitrogen and creatinine. Renal function tests should be obtained in patients for whom there is con\u00ad cern for dehydration or severe sepsis. They are also neces\u00ad sary before intravenous contrast is given for a computed tomography (CT) scan to prevent patients with renal insufficiency incurring contrast nephropat hy. Urinalysis. A urinary tract infection the presence of leukocyte esterase, nitrates, pyuria, and bacteria. Careful interpretation of this test is necessary, as inflamma tory processes ( eg, appendicitis, diverticulitis) near the ureter may produce pyuria in the absence of a UTI. ACUTE ABDOMINAL PAIN Pregnancy test. All females of childbearing age should be tested for pregnanc y. This is routinely accomplished through qualitative testing of the urine. If positive, this is followed by a quantitative serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin level in conjunction with pelvic ultrasound to exclude an ectopic pregnanc y. Liver function tests (LFTs). LFT abnormalities can be seen in both hepatic and biliary tract disorders. A hepatic picture involves increases in aspartate aminotransf erase (AST) and alanine aminotransf erase (ALT) greater than alkaline phosphatase (ALP). An obstructive (cholestatic) picture is seen when the increase in ALP is greater than that of AST/ ALT, along with the presence of hyperbilirubinemia. Marked transaminitis (> 1,000 IU/L) is typically only seen in toxin/drug-induced hepatitis, acute viral hepatitis, or ischemic hepatitis (shock liver). Lipase. A value 2 times normal is 94% sensitive and 95% specific for pancreatitis. An elevated lipase in con\u00ad junction with cholestatic LFT abnormalities should raise concern for gallstone pancreatitis. Coagulation tests. Patients on warfarin should have their international normalized ratio checked for both diag\u00ad nostic and treatment purposes. Being subtherapeutic in the setting of atrial fibrillation could raise concern for mesenteric ischemia. Supra-therapeutic levels can raise suspicion for hemorrhagic diseases such as a rectus sheath hematoma. Patients on warfarin going to the operating room may require reversal beforehand. Type and screen (T&S). T&S should be obtained in patients presenting with hemorrhage or going to the oper\u00ad ating room. It is also necessary in determining the Rh sta\u00ad tus of females being evaluated for ectopic pregnancy. ..... Electrocardiogram An electrocardiogram should be obtained as an initial screening tool in patients with unexplained epigastric pain or older patients with poorly localized pain. Cardiac mark\u00ad ers can be ordered for additional risk stratification. ..... Imaging Plain radiographs offer little diagnostic value in evaluating nonspecific abdominal pain, but can serve as an initial imaging study for perforated viscus, small bowel obstruc\u00ad tion, volvulus, or foreign bodies. Radiographs offer the advantage of being quick and portable, but owing to their poor sensitivity, cannot be used to definitively rule out disease. Upright chest x-ray can be used to screen for free air under the diaphragm (Figure 26-2). When a patient is unable to sit upright, a lateral decubitus may alternatively be used. Ultrasound plays a central role in evaluating patients for disorders of the biliary tract, reproductive system, or abdominal aorta. It is the primary radiologic modality in gonadal torsion, abscess. In children Figure 26-2. Radiograph showing free air under the diaphragm in a patient with a perforated viscus. pregnant women, it can serve as the initial imaging study of choice in evaluating for appendicitis. In hemodynamically unstable patients, bedside ultrasound enables the emer\u00ad gency physician to rapidly assess for the presence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm, intrauterine pregnan cy, hemorrhage. Computed tomography (CT) is widely employed in the diagnosis of abdominal diseases including infections (appendicitis, diverticulitis, abscess), vascular viscus, and nephrolithiasis. It is the radiologic study of choice when imaging is being pursued for undif\u00ad ferentiated abdominal pain. Its use is limited by contrast nephrop athy, contrast allergies, and exposure to ionizing radiation. The use of contrast agents is dictated by the study indication. Noncontrasted CT is obtained when con\u00ad firming nephrolithiasis. IV contrast is utilized in investi\u00ad gating neoplastic, infectious, and inflamma tory diseases. IV contrast areas of high blood flow ( eg, appendicitis ). IV contrast is furthermore utilized in detecting vascular lesions such as intimal flaps (aortic dissection), occlusion (mesenteric ischemia ), and leak\u00ad age (AAA). Oral contrast allows for visualization of the bowel lumen. Variation in opinion exists over its use. Conditions in which it can facilitate diagnosis include bowel perforation, fistulas, and partial bowel obstruc\u00ad tion. Both abscesses and loops of bowel appear as fluid\u00ad filled structures on CT, so oral contrast will help discrimina te between them, as only bowel should fill with contrast. MEDICAL DECISION MAKING A primary survey guided by vital signs, general appear\u00ad ance, and a focused abdominal exam should be con\u00ad ducted to screen for a life-or organ-threatening disease CHAPTER 26 Vital signs General appearance Focused abdominal exam ''The clinical presentation of gonadal torsion-particularly ovarian - is variable and can be subtle.

If not found, a second\u00ad ary search should begin for disease states requirin g identification before discharge (critical diagnoses). Certain diagnoses should be automatically considered in different age groups: AAA in the older adult, testicular torsion in the adolescent male, and ectopic pregnancy in females of reproduct ive age. As the most common surgi\u00ad cal disease of the abdomen, appendicitis should always be placed on the differential diagnosis regardless of age (Figure 26-3). TREATMENT Resuscitation should be initiated in patients with hemody \u00ad namic instability without delay. Volume repletion should begin with rapid infusion of isotonic crystalloid. In the setting of massive hemorrhage, emergency release blood (type O) can be transfused until typed and crossed blood is available. In septic shock, a vasopressor should be employed for persistent hypotension (mean arterial pres\u00ad sure [MAP) <65) after volume status has been optimized or during volume resuscitation in the setting of severe hemodynamic compromise (MAP <40-50 mmHg). Antibiotics should be promptly administered in patients with abdominal sepsis, peritonitis, or perforated viscus. Specific diseases requiring antibiotic treatment include appendicitis, cholecystitis, diverticulitis, pyelone\u00ad phritis, and pelvic inflammatory disease. Pain control can be tailored to the suspected disease process. When gastritis/peptic ulcer disease (PUD) is sus\u00ad viscous lidocaine, and Donnatal) may provide relief. Ketorolac is useful in the setting of biliary colic and neph\u00ad rolithiasis, but should be avoided in patients with PUD or chronic kidney disease. Multiple randomized studies have shown that narcotic pain medications do not interfere with diagnostic ability. These agents should not be withheld in patients with significant pain. Consultation with the appropriate surgical service should be emergently obtained for hemodynamic instabil\u00ad ity, suspected rup\u00ad tured ectopic, acute mesenteric occlusion), or abdominal ACUTE ABDOMINAL PAIN rigidity (ie, perforation). For patients with severe sepsis secondary to an intra-abdominal abscess or obstruction of the biliary tract, consultation with interventional radiology can be pursued for percutaneous drainage. DISPOSITION ..... Admission Patients found to have a surgical disease, abdominal sepsis, or intractable pain or vomiting regardless of the etiology should be admitted to the hospital. ..... Discharge Patients with resolution of symptoms without suspicion of serious underlying pathology may be discharged. Follow-up with a primary physician should be ensured, and the patient should be instructed to return if there is progression of symptoms. Patients with acute abdominal pain of unclear etiology who are discharged should be instructed to be re-examined within 12-24 hours by a health care provider if still having active pain.

Emerg Med Clin North Am. 2011;29:429-448. Appendicitis Anitha E. Mathew, MD Key Points The absence of leukocytosis or the presence of diarrhea does not rule out appendicitis. Appendicitis is a clinical diagnosis, with imaging aiding in atypical presentations or cases of diagnostic uncertainty. INTRODUCTION The lifetime risk of developing acute appendicitis in the United States is 12% for males and 25% for females. Appendicitis is caused by luminal obstruction of the appen\u00ad dix, typically by a fecalith, and less frequently by lymphatic tissue, gallstones, tumors, or parasites. Continued luminal secretion results in increased intraluminal pressure and vas\u00ad cular insufficienc y, leading to bacterial proliferation, inflam\u00ad mation, and ultimately perforation. CLINICAL PRESENTATION History One half of patients present to the emergency department within 24 hours of symptom onset, and another one third present within the following 24 hours. Early on, patients complain of general malaise, indigestion, anorexia, or bowel irregularit y. The presence of diarrhea should not be used to exclude appendicitis. The classic patient presenta \u00ad tion begins with periumbilical abdominal pain followed by nausea, with or without emesis, and low-grade fever, after which the pain migrates to the right lower quadrant (RLQ) (Table 27-1). Atypical presentations of appendicitis are common. Perforation often results in sudden resolution of pain and should be suspected in patients who present more than 48 hours after symptom onset. Rapid diagnosis and early surgical intervention help to avoid complications associated with rupture. Intravenous antibiotics should be administered if perfo\u00ad ration is likely or has occurred. Table 27-1. Frequency of historical features of appendicitis. Feature Frequency Abdominal pain 100% Anorexia 92% Nausea 78% Vomiting 54% Migration of pain 50% Fever 20% Diarrhea 15% Physical Examination Patients should receive a complete physical examina\u00ad tion, including a pelvic exam for any women of child\u00ad bearing age. Vague periumbilica l abdominal tenderness is observed early in the disease and then migrates to the McBurney point, located one-third of the distance between the right anterior superior iliac spine and the umbilicus. Rebound tenderness and involuntary guard\u00ad ing suggest peritonitis. Rovsing sign, or pain in the RLQ with palpation of the left lower quadrant (LLQ), can 118 also be present. The psoas sign is elicited if abdominal pain is produced with extension of the right leg at the hip while the patient lies on the left side. The obturator test elicits pain with internal and external rotation of the hip. Perforation should be suspected in patients with generalized tenderness, rigidity, or a palpable mass in the RLQ. Up to one third of patients have atyp ical presenta\u00ad tions of acute appendicitis, often owing to anatomic variations. A retrocecal appendix can produce right flank or pelvic pain, whereas malrotation of the colon results in appendicea l transposition with LUQ pain. Although pregnant women with appendicitis most com\u00ad monly complain of RLQ pain, they can have RUQ ten\u00ad derness owing to gravid uterine displacement of the abdominal organs. DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES ...... Laboratory Individuals with acute appendicitis commonl y have a mild leukocytosis with a left shift, but a normal white blood cell count (WBC) is not uncommon. An elevated WBC and/or C-reactive protein can have a combined sensitivity up to 98%, and normal values of both make appendicitis very unlikely. Although hematuria or ster\u00ad ile pyuria can be present in acute appendicitis, isolated microscopic hematuria may support a diagnosis of renal colic, and pyuria can suggest pyelonephritis. A negative pregnanc y test should be documented in females of childbearing age to rule out ectopic or het\u00ad erotopic pregnancy. ..... Imaging Early surgical consultation should be obtained before imaging in straightforward cases of suspected appendi\u00ad citis (ie, male with classic presentation and onset of pain <48 hours). Plain radiography is not helpful. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) should be obtained in non\u00ad pregnant females and males for whom the diagnosis is unclear. CT has a sensitivity of >94% and a positive predictive value of >95%. Many centers recommend CT imaging with both IV and oral contrast, although non\u00ad contrast CT imaging is increasin gly being used. Typical findings include a dilated appendix >6 mm with a thick\u00ad ened wall, periappendic eal stranding, and visualization of an appendicolith or abscess (Figure 2 7-1). Luminal obstruction may be relieved with perforation, leading to disappearance of imaging hallmarks and difficulty visu\u00ad alizing the appendix. Patients with abdominal pain for >48 hours usually require a CT scan to diagnose abscess formation that is treated with percutaneous drainage rather than surgery.

MEDICAL DECISION MAKING Acute appendicitis is largely a clinical diagnosis and should be considered in any patient with atraumatic right-sided abdomina l, periumbilical, or flank pain who has not had an appendectomy. The differential diagnosis of such a patient is broad and includes diverticulitis, vol\u00ad vulus, colitis, ileitis, bowel hematoma, and psoas abscess (Figure Patients with acute appendicitis typically require appen\u00ad dectomy, so surgical consult should be obtained promptly. Patients should be kept NPO (nothing by mouth) to avoid operative delays and be given IV hydration, antiemetics, and analgesics, including narcotics, as needed. Periopera tive antibiotics should be given once the diagnosis has been made or if the patient exhibits signs of peritonitis. Appropriate choices should include broad coverage of aerobic and anaerobic gram-negative organisms, such as ciprofloxacin and metronidazole.

Pittman- Waller VA, Myers JG, Stewart RM, et al. Appendicitis: why so complicated? Analysis Acute Cholecystitis Casey Glass, MD Key Points Biliary colic frequently presents with epigastric or right upper quadrant pain that resolves in a few hours and is not associated with fever or leukocytosis. Acute cholecystitis cannot be established or excluded based on history and examination alone. INTRODUCTION Acute cholecystitis can be a challenging diagnosis because the spectrum of disease ranges from biliary colic, a self\u00ad limited condition, to emphysematous cholecystitis or gall\u00ad bladder perforation with sepsis. Addition ally, no single historical feature, exam finding, or test result is adequate to exclude the disease in its early stages. When a gallstone moves into the gallbladder neck, cystic duct, or common bile duct, it causes obstruction. Obstruc \u00ad tion in turn causes an increase in luminal pressure in the gallbladder or common bile duct. In biliary colic, the obstruction is intermittent, and symptoms resolve when the blockage is relieved. If obstruction is persistent, there is a resulting increase in mucosal inflammation and irrita\u00ad tion. Ultimately this leads to ischemia of the gallbladder wall and bacterial invasion. Biliary colic is pain due to transient gallbladder neck blockage with a gallstone. Acute cholecystitis is inflaruma\u00ad tion of the gallbladder due to persistent obstruction from gallstones and is sometimes associated with infection. Acalculous cholecystitis accounts for 2-15% of cases of acute cholecystitis and occurs in the absence of gallstones. Acalculous cholecystitis is believed to be secondary to gall\u00ad bladder ischemia and is more common in diabetics, the elderly, and the critically ill and carries a higher mortality rate. Emphysematous cholecystitis is acute cholecystitis 121 Antibiotics should be administered early in ill-appearing patients when acute cholecystitis is suspected. with superinfection by gas-forming bacteria and has a more severe course and poorer prognosis. When gallstones become lodged in the common bile duct, the condition is referred to as choledocholithiasis. Choledocholithiasis is associated with ascending cholangitis and pancreatitis. Gallstones are present in 10--15% of the population in the United States, but only 10--20% of persons with asymp\u00ad tomatic stones will develop complications over a 20-year period, and only 1-3% will develop acute cholecystitis each year. When patients do develop acute cholecystitis, the mor\u00ad tality rate is approxima tely emphysematous cholecystitis is approximately 20%. CLINICAL PRESENTATION ..... History Patients with biliary colic present with acute onset of con\u00ad stant crampy pain in the right upper quadrant or epigas\u00ad trium that may radiate to the back. Pain persisting for more than 6 hours is unusual and should raise concern for early cholecystitis. Nausea and vomiting are present to varying degrees, and fever is usually absent. Acute cholecystitis presents in much the same way as biliary colic, but symptoms are persistent and localize to the right upper quadrant. The pain may radiate to the right or left shoulder owing to irritation of the diaphragm. Fever CHAPTER 28 Table 28-1.

No historical or exam finding is adequately sensitive or specific to exclude or confirm the diagnosis of cholecystitis (Table 28-1). The history should focus on previous epi\u00ad sodes of similar symptoms and previous surgery. Patients may describe exacerbations of pain related to food or late at night. Although uncomm on, patients who have had a cholecystectomy can retain stones in the common bile duct after surgery or develop them later. It is important to ask about respiratory or cardiac symptoms to help exclude a thoracic cause for the pain. Family history of gallstones, female sex, parity, rapid weight loss, and hemolytic disor\u00ad ders are several important risk factors for gallstones . ..... Physical Examination The physical examination should focus on excluding other abdominal or thoracic causes of pain and determining the degree of pain in the right upper quadrant. In biliary colic, tenderness on examination may be mild. The Murphy sign is the most specific physical exam finding for cholecystitis and is described as the patient halting inspiration when the examiner is palpating deeply in the right upper quadrant. The examiner should also assess for costovertebral angle tenderness and right lower quadrant tenderness. DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES ..... Laboratory Studies It is hard to discriminate biliary colic from early cholecys\u00ad titis, and laboratory evaluation is almost always indicated. A complete blood count ( CBC) may help in determining the presence of infection, especially because fever may be absent. However, the CBC may be normal in acute cholecystitis. Liver function tests may help identify biliary obstruction or hepatic inflammation. Serum lipase is help\u00ad ful when there is a concern for choledocholithiasis and associated gallstone pancreatitis. .... Imaging Ultrasound evaluation of the gallbladder and common bile duct remains the best test for identifying cholecystitis. The sensitivity ( 88-94%) and specificity ( 80-90%) vary depending on what criteria are used to establish the diag\u00ad nosis. On ultrasound examination, gallstones appear as hyperechoic intraluminal structures, and larger stones will cast an ultrasound shadow (Figure 28-1 ). Findings suggestive of cholecystitis include gallbladder wall thickness greater than 3-5 mm and pericholecystic fluid. A common bile duct diameter greater than S-8 mm is abnormal. The sonographic Murphy sign is positive when maximal pain is produced with transducer pressure over the gallbladder. When combined with the presence of gallstones, the sono\u00ad graphic Murphy sign has a positive predictive value of 92%. The sonographic Murphy sign can be masked by Figure 28-1. Short axis view of the gallbladder demonstrating a gallbladder neck stone (large arrow) and gallbladder wall thickening (small arrows). \u00a9 casey Glass, MD. ACUTE CHOLECYSTITIS Figure 28-2.

Abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan is helpful when other diagnoses are also being considered. CT scan\u00ad ning is less sensitive for acute cholecystitis than ultrasound ( 50-90%), but is as sensitive for choledocholithiasis and can identify complications such as perforation or abscess for\u00ad mation. CT findings include wall tic and biliary tree dilation (Figure 28-2). Notably, only 20% of gallstones are radio-opaque, which limits the utility of CT in early cases of cholecystitis or for patients with biliary colic. MEDICAL DECISION MAKING The patient with classic symptoms of biliary colic or acute cholecystitis is easy to identify, but many patients present with atypical symptoms (Figure 28-3). It is important to consider other conditions that may masquerade as gall\u00ad bladder pain. This may include pyelonephritis of the right kidney or retrocecal appendicitis. Right lower lobe pneu\u00ad monia can also present with right upper quadrant pain and vomiting. Patients with choledocholithiasis are often misdiagn osed as having pancreatitis or gastritis. In elderly patients or those with coronary disease, it is important to consider the possibility of an inferior myocardial infarc\u00ad tion. Patients who appear septic or with peritoneal signs may have perforation or ascending cholangitis. Other gas\u00ad trointestinal (GI) conditions such as pancreatitis, peptic ulcer disease, or hepatitis should also be considered. lab tests, IV fluids, pain meds Reevaluate the patient Consider alternate diagnoses If suspicion remains high, consider abdominal CT scan and/or admission. .A Figure 28-3. CT, computed tomography; IV, intravenous; RUQ, right upper quadrant. CHAPTER 28 TREATMENT All patients are likely to need pain control. Morphine (0.1 mglkg) Nor hydromorphone (0.0125 mgj kg N) are common choices. Antiemetics are also helpful, with common regimens being ondansetron 4-8 mg IV, pro\u00ad rly, or metoclo \u00ad prarnide 10 mg N. If vomiting has been prolonged, then fluid resuscitation at 10-20 mL/kg is indicated, unless there is a concern for volume overload (history of congestive heart failure, end-stage renal disease). Patients should be made NPO (nothing by mouth) until it is clear they will not need surgery. Surgical consultation is necessary when the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis is established. Cholecystectomy is usu\u00ad ally performed within 48-72 hours. If testing is equivocal, then admission for further work-up is appropriate. Consultation with a GI specialist is necessary for choledo\u00ad cholithiasis to facilitate timely endoscopic retrograde chol\u00ad angiopancreatography and sphincterotom y. There is no clear role for antibiotics in uncomplicated cholecystitis. If there are signs of infection (leukocytosis, fever), then antimicrobial coverage with a second-generation cephalosporin or quinolone with metronidazole is appro\u00ad priate. If the patient presents with sepsis or is at risk to develop sepsis (elderly, immune system compromise, high\u00ad risk presentation such as ascending cholangitis, emphyse\u00ad matous cholecysti tis), then broad-sp ectrum antibiotics should be started promptly. The antibiotic regimen should cover both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. Antibiotic choices include piperacillin-tazobactam 3.375 g N and vancomycin 1 g N, or in penicillin allergic patients, ciprofloxacin 400 mg N, metronidazole 500 mg N, and vancomycin 1 g N. DISPOSITION Admission Patients with acute cholecystitis should be admitted to a surgical service. Patients with sepsis or severe disease should be admitted to an intensive care unit setting. Admission should also be strongly considered for patients with persistent symptoms but without definitive evidence of acute cholecystitis, as testing can be normal early in the course of the disease. Discharge Patients with biliary colic can be discharged home if their pain has resolved, testing is normal, and they can tolerate oral fluids. They should be told to return for persistent symptoms, more severe pain, or fever. Outpatient follow up should include referral to a general surgeon. SUGGESTED READING Atilla R, Oktay C.

The most common misdiagno sis is renal colic. AM must be considered in any elderly patient with back, flank, or groin pain. INTRODUCTION Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is an increase in the diameter of the aorta of more than 50%, or an infrarenal aortic diameter greater than 3 em. The etiology and patho\u00ad genesis of AAA is unclear, although atherosclerosis, connec\u00ad tive tissue disorders, genetic factors, and smoking have all been implicated. A family of enzymes known as matrix metalloproteinases may be largely responsible for the inflam\u00ad matory destruction of elastin and collagen fibers in the medial and adventitial layers of the aortic wall that can ulti - mately lead to AAA formation, enlargement, and rupture. The rate of expansion and risk of rupture are related to tension on the wall of the aneurysm, which in turn is related to the diameter of the aneurysm and to the under\u00ad lying pressure. Rupture of aneurysms smaller than 4 em is rare, whereas the annual risk of rupture for aneurysms larger than 8 em has been estimated at 30-50%. AAA causes 15,000 deaths in the United States a year. It is a common cause of sudden death and is responsible for 1-2% of all deaths in men older than 65 years. The overall mortality rate of a patient with a ruptured AAA is 90%, and 50% of patients with ruptured AAA do not survive to reach the hospital. In patients who arrive at the hospital, the mor\u00ad tality rate improves to 60%. The mortality rate for elective open operative repair is 2-7%; recent advances in endovascu\u00ad lar technique have mitigated early morbidity and mortality. Suspected ruptured AAA requires emergent consulta\u00ad tion, with the goal of immediate open or endovascular repair. Patients with incidentally discovered AAAs must be referred for surveillance or elective repair. The incidence of AAA begins to increase in men older than 55 years. By age 80 years, 5% of men have an AAA, and 5% of women age 90 years have AAA. There is an increased incidence in smokers, whites, and those with a family history of AAA. First-degree relatives of patients with AAA have up to an 8-fold increase in the chance of developing AAA. CLINICAL PRESENTATION ..... History The emergency department (ED) presentation of AAA is var\u00ad ied, with symptoms due to expansion and rupture, distal thromboembolic complications, local mass effects, or erosion into adjacent structures. Most AAAs are asymptomatic and discovered incidentally while evaluating patients for unrelated conditions. These patients require little more than referral. At the other end of the spectrum, AAA rupture can constitute one of the most acutely life-threatening emergencies in medicine. The classic triad of abdominal/back pain, hypotension, and a pulsatile abdominal mass is present in substantially less than one half of patients with a ruptured AAA. The vast majority of patients with ruptured AAA will have pain, typically in the abdomen, back, flank, or groin, depending on the extent and direction of rupture. Rarely, patients with rupture can present with syncope alone or with nonspecific symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhea, or dizziness. 125 CHAPTER 29 ..... Physical Examination Patients with ruptured AAA may present with evidence of hemorrhagic shock: hypotension, tachycardia, and exam findings of poor perfusion. However, the patient may be normotensive or even hypertensive. Transient hypotension may also occur and can be erroneously attributed to a vaso\u00ad vagal etiology. Abdominal examination may detect a pulsa\u00ad tile mass, but this can be difficult with small aneurysms or obese patients and is subject to significant interobserver variability. Absence of a pulsatile mass on exam does not exclude the diagnosis of AAA . Lower extremity pulses should be assessed, as lower limb ischemia is present in 5% of cases. DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES ..... Laboratory Any patient with a possible ruptured AAA should have blood sent for type and crossmatch, although often uncrossma tched blood will be required emergently. Anemia can be seen in ruptured AAA , with hematocrit less than 38 in 40% of patients. D-dimer assays have been investigated as a possible screen for patients deemed to be at low risk for AAA , but their use for this indication has not yet been validated. .... Imaging Ultrasound has a sensitivity approaching 100% and can be obtained at the bedside even in unstable patients. In addi\u00ad tion to the aneurysm, ultrasound may reveal intraperito \u00ad neal free fluid in cases of rupture. However, because many AAAs rupture into the retroperitoneum, ultrasound is insensitive in detecting this complication, and a lack of free fluid should not be reassuring. Ultrasound can also be limited by obesity and by overlying bowel gas. A .&.Figure 29-1. CT scan showing a ruptured AAA. This AAA is rupturing into the peritoneal cavity (arrow). The majority of ruptured AAAs are retroperitoneal (70%). Abdominal computed tomography (CT) is preoperative is better at detecting suprarenal aneurysms, and shows retroperitoneal bleeding not visible on ultrasound. CT can also reveal alternative etiologies for abdominal pain and can be considered a first-line diagnos\u00ad tic modality in stable patients (Figure 29-1) . PROCEDU RES Bedside ultrasound allows for rapid detection of an aortic aneurysm. Place the abdominal probe in the epigastric area in the transverse plane (Figure 29-2). The aorta is located ante\u00ad rior and just to the left of the vertebral bodies. Move the probe inferiorly until the aorta bifurcates at the umbilicus. Next, rotate the probe 90 degrees to obtain a longitudinal view. 8 Figure 29-2. Ultrasound of an AAA. A. Transverse position of probe. 8. Transverse view of AAA. ABDOMINAL l/back/flank/ groin pain abdominal mass Suspect ruptured AAA .A. Figure 29-3. AAA diagnostic algorithm. MEDICAL DECISION MAKING AAA must be ruled out in any elderly patient who presents with abdominal, back, flank, or groin pain. Hemod y\u00ad namically stable patients can be evaluated with CT, whereas unstable patients are better assessed with a bedside ultra\u00ad sound (Figure 29-3). Other emergent causes of abdominal, back, and flank pain should be considered and evaluated concurrently. Consider ruptured AAA in elderly patients \"found down\" or with otherwise unexplained hypotension. Any patient with abdominal pain and previous repair of AAA, either open or endovascular, merits consultation with the patient's surgeon. TREATMENT Patients with ruptured AAA require immediate treatment in the ED with 2large-bore (16-gauge) IV lines in the ante\u00ad cubital veins or a large-bore (SF) central line and subse\u00ad quent resuscitation with IV crystalloid and uncrossmatched blood. The ideal goal blood pressure is not known, and many practitioners will allow relative hypotension pending definitive operative repair. A vascular surgeon should be consulted immedia tely, and the patient should be taken to the operating room or angiography suite as soon as possi\u00ad ble to repair the AAA. Unruptured, symptomatic AAAs require evaluation by a vascular surgeon. These patients may benefit from early elective repair, depending on the size of the aneurysm. Patients with incidentally discovered asymptomatic aneu\u00ad rysms should be referred for surveillance or elective repair. Consider smoking cessation counseling, beta\u00ad blockers, antihyperlipid agents, and low-dose aspirin, as appropriate. CT or ultrasound DISPOSITION ..... Admission All patients with symptomatic AAAs should be admitted for observation, further investigati on, or surgery, in con\u00ad sultation with a vascular surgeon. If vascular surgery consultation is not available, consider transfer. Both open and endovascular outcomes are superior in centers that perform a high volume of AAA repair. Ruptured AAA mandates immediate surgery or endovascular repair if the patient is to have any reasonable chance of survival. ..... Discharge Patients with an asymptomatic AAA (i.e., incidental find\u00ad ing) and an alternate benign cause for their symptoms may be discharged after follow-up with a vascular surgeon has been arranged and appropriate risk factor modification has been initiated.

Gastrointestinal Bleeding jeffery A. Baker, MD Key Points Aggressive resuscitative measures (intravenous access, crystalloid bolus, and blood products) are necessary in unstable patients with gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. A negative nasogastric lavage does not completely exclude an upper Gl bleed. A brisk upper Gl bleed should be considered in the differential of patients who present with hematochezia. INTRODUCTION Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding accounts for 5% of admis\u00ad sions from the emergency department (ED). An interven\u00ad tion is required to stop ongoing hemorrhage in 10% of patients. Bleeding can occur anywhere along the GI tract and can be grossly divided into upper and lower sources. Upper GI bleeding is defined as occurring proximal to the ligament of Treitz (the suspensory ligament of the duode\u00ad num). Lower GI bleeding is defined as occurring distal to the ligament of Treitz. Upper GI bleeding is 4-8 times more common than lower GI bleeding. It is not always possible to clinically distinguish between upper and lower GI bleeding in the ED, but appearance of the gastric contents and stool can provide clues to the source of the hemorrhage. Hematemesis is the vomiting of blood and indicates an upper GI bleed. \"Coffee ground\" emesis suggests that the blood has partially digested and that bleed\u00ad ing is either slow or has stopped. A nasogastric (NG) tube aspirate positive for blood also indicates an upper GI source of bleeding. NG lavage can be negative in 25% of patients with an upper GI source of bleeding because the nasogastric tube does not reliably pass the pylorus. Melena is black, tarry stool that reflects the presence of blood in the GI tract for more than 8 hours. At least Octreotide should be administered in patients with liver disease and significant upper Gl bleeding, even when the diagnosis of esophageal varices has not been confirmed. Emergent endoscopy should be arranged when active upper Gl bleeding is present. 300 mL of blood must be present to produce melena. Melena is 4 times more likely to be from an upper GI source of bleeding and almost always reflects bleeding proximal to the right side of the colon. Hematochezia is bright red or maroon-colored blood per rectum. It is 6 times more likely to be from a lower GI source. An excep\u00ad tion is a rapid upper GI source of bleeding. Hematochezia is present in 10% of upper GI bleeds. The three most common causes of upper GI bleeding are peptic ulcer disease, gastritis, and varices (Table 30-1). Lower GI bleeding may be due to multiple causes, but Table 30-1. Causes of upper Gl bleeding. Cause Peptic ulcer (duodenal 2/3) Erosive gastritis and gastric) Mallory-Weiss tear Other GASTROINTESTINAL of lower Gl bleeding. Cause Diverticulosis Inflammatory bowel pseudome mbranous CLINICAL PRESENTATION ..... History In cases, patients will report hematemesis, coffee\u00ad ground emesis, hematochezia, or melena. The duration and frequency of these symptoms should be elicited. For hematemesis, it is important to determine whether blood was present initially or appeared after several episodes of vomiting. The latter history suggests a Mallory-Weiss tear. A history compatible with cirrhosis (chronic alcohol use, hepatitis, IV drug use) suggests varices. These patients may also have a coagulop athy, making control of hemor\u00ad rhage more difficult. When bleeding has been slow but chronic, the patient may present with lightheade dness, fatigue, chest pain, or shortness of breath owing to anemia without any knowledge of GI bleeding. Patients with pep\u00ad tic ulcer disease may report epigastric abdominal pain related to eating. Agents that increase the risk of peptic ulcer disease include nonsteroidal anti-inflamma tory drugs (NSAIDs), aspirin, and cigarettes. Elderly patients with acute hemorrhage may initially present with syncope or near-syncope. ..... Physical Examination Vital signs should be obtained immediately. When abnor\u00ad malities are present, treatment is frequently necessary before obtaining a thorough history. Tachycardia and hypotension indicate hypovolemic shock and require immediate resuscitation. Cool, pale, and clammy skin is evidence of anemia or shock. The abdomen should be thoroughly examined, noting areas of tenderness or peri to\u00ad nitis. Rectal examination should be performed with Hemoccult testing. The presence of hemorrhoids should be documented. They may or may not be the source of lower GI bleeding. Examination should also elicit any evi\u00ad dence of the stigmata or DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES ..... Laboratory Complete blood count, electrolytes, renal function, and coagulation studies should be obtained. It is important to remember that a normal hemoglobin value does not rule out a massive acute hemorrhage. Compensatory hemodi\u00ad lution may not occur for 2-3 hours. Blood bank should be contacted for immediate type and screen. Blood products should be ordered for patients with unstable vital signs or significant blood loss. Upper GI bleeding may elevate blood urea nitrogen because of the digestion and absorp\u00ad tion of hemoglobin . .... Imaging Upright chest x-ray is indicated in patients with suspicion of perforation or aspiration. The presence of free air under the diaphragm is diagnostic of perforation and is a surgical emergenc y. Routine imaging otherwise offers little clinical value in GI bleeding . ..... Electrocardiogram An electrocardiogram should be obtained on patients with risk factors for coronary artery disease, patient with known heart disease, or patients with symptoms concerning for coronary ischemia. Silent ischemia can occur as a result of decreased oxygen delivery related to blood loss. PROCEDU RES Nasogastric aspiration should be performed on patients suspected of having an upper GI bleed. Aspirate appearing like gross blood or \"coffee grounds\" is evidence of an upper GI source. The stomach may then be lavaged with 200-300 mL saline to see if the aspirate clears. Note that false negatives may occur with bleeding distal to the pylorus, and false positives may occur from nasal trauma. NG aspiration is an especially uncomfortable and anxiety-provoking proce\u00ad dure for the patient, and the use of topical anesthetic is advised. Although NG aspiration in GI bleeding is rou\u00ad tinely performed, it will only yield a useful diagnostic result in a minority of cases. MEDICAL DECISION MAKING The exact location of GI bleeding is usually not determined in the initial ED evaluation. Examination of any emesis, stool, or NG aspirate may help to determine the general location of the hemorrhage and direct further diagnostic and treatment strategies (Figure 30-1). TREATMENT Patients with active GI bleeding should be placed on a car\u00ad diac monitor with supplemental oxygen. Large peripheral IV catheters should be inserted in unstable patients. If these Suspected Gl bleeding Hematemesis/ positive NG aspirate No Hematochezia/ negative NG No Melena Yes Yes Yes CHAPTER 30 Upper Gl bleeding Probable lower Gl bleeding Probable upper Gl algorithm. nasogastric. lines cannot be inserted, a large-bore (SF) central line should be placed to maximize vohune resuscitation. N fluid bolus of 1-2 L of normal saline should be administered. If the patient remains unstable after the fluid bolus, administra\u00ad tion of packed red blood cells (RBCs) is indicated. Uncross\u00ad matched type 0 blood is ordered for patients with unstable vital signs and significant blood loss. If a coagulopathy is suspected, fresh-frozen plasma is also ordered. For upper GI bleeding, histarnine-2 antagonists are fre\u00ad quently administered, although they have not been shown to be of any benefit in the acute setting. Proton pump inhibitors decrease the rate of re-bleeding. Pantoprazole 80 mg N bolus followed by 5 mg!hr infusion is recommended. Octreotide is beneficial in decreasing the rate of bleeding, the incidence of rebleeding, and mortality by decreasing portal hypertension. It is particularly useful in variceal bleeding, but may also reduce bleeding from nonvariceal sources. Administer a 50-meg N bolus followed by 50 mcg!hr N drip. Emergent endoscopy is indicated for patients with fresh blood in the NG aspirate and hematochezia from an upper GI source. Patients with liver disease also benefit from early endoscopic intervention. Surgical intervention may be required in patients with uncontrolled hemorrhage, perforation, or patients with liver disease and portal hypertension. In the setting of a suspected lower GI source of bleeding, consult gastroenterology and surgical services early in unsta\u00ad ble patients. Diagnostic and therapeutic options include angiograph y, technetium-labeled RBC scan, colonoscop y, or surgical intervention for partial colectom y. Angiography allows for localization and arterial embolization, whereas a technetium-labeled RBC scan localizes the bleeding site only. In emergent cases, colonoscopy misses the diagnosis in 40% of cases because of poor bowel preparation. When the site of bleeding is identified during colonosco py, it may allow for therapeutic interventions to stop bleeding, but is unsuccess\u00ad ful in 20% of cases. Surgical intervention is required in cases of massive lower GI bleeding when other therapies fail. DISPOSITION Admission Upper GI bleed. Most patients with an upper GI bleed require admission. Admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) setting should be strongly considered for patients with unstable vital signs, age > 75 years, persistent bleeding that does not clear with NG lavage, presence of coagulop a\u00ad thy or severe anemia (hematocrit <20%), evidence of portal hypertension, or unstable comorbid conditions. Lower GI bleed. Most patients with lower GI bleeding will require admission. ICU admission is appropriate for unstable patients. Mortality is higher in elderly patients with comorbidities, and these features should prompt con\u00ad sideration for admission to an intensive care setting. Discharge Upper GI bleed. Discharge with close follow-up can be arranged for reliable patients who meet all of the following criteria: age <65 years, no comorbidities including coagulopa\u00ad thy, no significant liver disease, normal vital signs, negative NG lavage and no melena, and a hemoglobin > 10 grnldL. Recent clinical scoring systems (Glasgow- Blatchford bleeding score) may help predict which patients can be safely dis\u00ad charged from the ED without endoscopy. Lower GI bleed. Young stable patients with normal hemoglobin, no active bleeding, evidence of hemorrhoids or fissures as a possible source, and no evidence of portal hypertension, coagulop athy, or other significant comor\u00ad bidities may be discharged with close follow-up.

Schaye, MD Colleen N. Hickey, MD Key Points Intestinal obstruction presents with acute abdominal pain, abdominal distension, and vomiting. Abdominal radiographs can demonstrate obstruction, but computed tomography is more sensitive. INTRODUCTION Intestinal obstruction refers to failure of intestinal contents to pass through the bowel lumen. Mechanical obstruction refers to physical blockage of luminal contents. This occurs in either small bowel (80% of cases) or large bowel (20% of cases). The most common cause of mechanical obstruc\u00ad tion is adhesions from prior abdominal surgery (SOo/o), followed malignancy (20%), (10%), inflamma\u00ad tory bowel disease (So/o), and volvulus Intestinal obstructions can be either partial or com\u00ad plete. Partial obstructions are often managed nonopera \u00ad tively. Complete obstructions carry more risk of morbidity and can result in strangulation. As bowel contents are prevented from forward flow, increased secretions result in overdisten tion, which causes bowel wall edema and reduced lymphatic and venous outflow. This is referred to as strangulation and can progress to bowel ischemia, necrosis, perforation, and peritonitis. Up to 40% of small bowel obstructions become strangulated, most commonly from volvulus, adhesions, and hernias. A closed-loop obstruction occurs when there is mechanical blockage both proximal and distal to a bowel segment. This results in very high risk of strangulation because bowel contents are prevented from both forward and retrograde flow. Small bowel obstructions represent lSo/o of hospital admissions for acute abdominal pain. Approximately 131 Intestinal obstruction is treated with intravenous fluids, nasogastric suctioning, antiemetics, narcotic pain medi\u00ad cations, and antibiotics in select cases. Strangulation is a complication of obstruction that can lead to bowel ischemia, peritonitis, and sepsis. 300,000 operations are performed every year in the United States for obstruction. Mortality rate overall is approxi\u00ad mately So/o, whereas the mortality rate from strangulated obstructions approaches 30%. In contrast to mechanical obstruct ion, functional obstruction (eg, adynamic ileus ) occurs when intestinal contents fail to pass because of disturbances in gut motility. It most commonly occurs immedia tely after surgery, but can also be seen in inflammatory conditions, electrolyte abnormalities, and from certain medications (namely, narcotics ). Unless noted otherwise, the remainder of this chapter refers to mechanical obstruction. CLINICAL PRESENTATION .... History The most common initial complaint is intermittent colicky abdominal pain. If the obstruction is proximal, the patient may also complain of nausea and vomiting. More distal obstructions can result in delayed onset of vomiting. Although obstipation (lack of flatus and bowel move\u00ad ments) can suggest an obstruction, the presence of flatus or bowel movements should not be used as evidence that an obstruction has not occurred, as these can be seen early in the course of even complete obstructions. The patient his\u00ad tory should include questions about prior surgeries, history CHAPTER 31 of hernias, and history of obstruction in the past, as prior intestinal obstructions have up to SOo/o recurrence rate. Physical Examination Vital signs may be normal or abnormal. Fever, tachycardia, and hypotension are ominous signs and may suggest peri\u00ad tonitis or sepsis. Patients will usually appear uncomfort \u00ad able regardless of their position. Physical exam is significant for a distended, diffusely tender abdomen, tympany to percussion, and hyperactive bowel sounds. If strangulation has occurred there may be peritonitis on exam. Patients should be examined for evidence of prior abdominal sur\u00ad geries (eg, incision scars) and examined for hernias. DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES Laboratory Electrolyte abnormalities such as hypokalemia and acid- base disturbances can occur due to vomiting. Third spac- A ing of fluid and dehydration from vomiting may cause elevated blood urea nitrogen or creatinine. Intestinal isch\u00ad emia can cause an anion gap metabolic acidosis with an elevated lactic acid. Leukocytosis may be present on a complete blood count and also suggests ischemia or peri\u00ad tonitis. Consideration should be given to checking liver function studies, amylase, lipase, and urinalysis to evaluate for other etiologies of the patient's symptoms. Imaging Radiographs are 50-66% sensitive in diagnosing an intesti\u00ad nal obstruction. An \"obstructive series\" classically consists of 3 radiographs: upright chest film, supine abdominal film, and upright abdominal film. A lateral decubitus x-ray may also be included. The upright chest film is used to evaluate for evidence of perforation (free air under the diaphragm). The upright abdominal film will show dilated loops of bowel (>3 em), air-fluid levels (layering of intestinal contents ), and absence of air in the rectum (Figure 31-1A). The \"string of pearls\" sign is a series of small pockets of gas in a row. It represents a predominance of fluid in the bowel lumen with small amounts of air trapped between the valvulae conniventes of the bowel. In adynamic ileus, radiographs will demonstrate dilation of the bowel without air-fluid levels. An abdominal CT scan is much more sensitive than radiographs (92-100% sensitive) (Figure 31-lB). CT also has the advantage of being able to determine the location of obstruction, as well as bowel wall edema, and findings suggestive of bowel ischemia. A CT scan may also show the cause of the obstruction (eg, hernia, malignanc y). If no cause is identified, adhesions may be the etiology. In patients with fever, localized abdominal pain, or abnormal vital signs, a CT scan should be the initial study of choice owing to its greater sensitivity and the need for timely diagnosis. B Figure 31-1. A. Upright abdominal radiograph of small bowel obstruction. Note the multiple air-fluid levels and the \"string of pearls\" sign (arrow). B. Abdominal CT scan demonstrating bowel obstruction. PROCEDURES Most intestinal obstructions benefit from decompres\u00ad sion with a nasogastric (NG) tube. Placement of an NG tube is uncomf ortable for the patient and should be carried out in the following manner to decrease pain and anxiety: 1. Sit the patient upright with the head of the stretcher at 90\u00b0. Determine which nostril is less congested by having the patient blow the nose on both sides. Inject viscous lidocaine into the nostril or alternatively spray benzo\u00ad caine into the nostril and mouth. INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION Clinical suspicion of bowel obstruction IVF, NGT, admit, surgical consultation High clinical suspicion: obtain CT scan Low clinical suspicion: search for alternate the NG tube straight back until the tip is at the posterior pharynx, and then pause. Give the patient a glass of water with a straw. Instruct the patient that as they begin to swallow the water, you will insert the tube. 3. Insert the tube as the patient swallows. The tube is inserted to approximately 30-40 em. Coughing after placement suggests inadvertent placement in the lung. 4. Check the location of the tube by inserting 60 mL of air and listening over the stomach for gurgling. Aspiration of stomach contents will also indicate that the tube is in the proper location. An abdominal radiograph should be used to confirm the correct location. 5. Tape the tube securely to the nose. Place the tube to low intermittent suction (LIS). MEDICAL DECISION MAKING Diagnosis of intestinal obstruction relies on careful patient history, physical exam, and interpretation of imaging stud\u00ad ies (Figure 31-2). Obstruction should be considered in any patient with a history of prior surgeries, as adhesions are the leading cause. Do not rule out obstruction based on the presence of flatus or bowel movements or the lack of vom\u00ad iting, as these findings may develop later. If clinical suspi\u00ad cion is high enough, consider starting with a CT scan instead of radiographs. If the patient appears acutely ill, begin with resuscitation and consult a surgeon immedi\u00ad ately even if imaging studies have not been completed. TREATMENT Establish intravenous (IV) access promptly and begin administration of fluids. An initial bolus of 1-2 L of 0.9 normal saline is appropriate, but some patients may require more aggressive fluid resuscitation to replace third\u00ad spaced volume loss. Antiemetics should be given (ondan\u00ad setron 4 mg IV, prochlorperazine 10 mg IV, promethazine 25 mg IV). Consider narcotic pain medications (morphine 4 mg IV, hydromorphone 0.5 mg IV) and repeat as needed. An NG tube should be inserted once the diagnosis of obstruction has been made and should be placed to low CHAPTER 31 intermittent suction (LIS). This results in decompression of the bowel lumen, provides symptomatic relief, and may avoid the need for surgery. Broad-sp ectrum antibiotics that cover be given in the presence of fever, peritonitis, or evidence of strangulation. Surgical consultation should be obtained in case the patient requires surgical interven\u00ad tion. For patients with adynamic ileus, treatment involves cessation of any narcotic medications and initiation of motility agents (eg, metoclopramide ). DISPOSITION ..... Admission All patients with intestinal obstruction require admission, either to a surgical service or a medicine service with a surgeon on consult. Most patients can be admitted to floor units. Intensive care unit admission is indicated for patients with unstable vital signs (tachycardia, hypotension) or sepsis. Urgent surgery is required in patients with peri toni\u00ad tis, perforation, or strangulation. ..... Discharge None. SUGGESTED READING Diaz JJ Jr, Bokhari F, Mowery NT.

Kraemer, MD Key Points The classic presentation of mesenteric ischemia is acute abdominal pain that is \"out of proportion\" to exam. The majority of patients with mesenteric ischemia have an embolus due to atrial fibrillation. INTRODUCTION Acute mesenteric ischemia is a syndrome characterized by inadequate blood flow to the mesentery with resultant hypoxemia of the tissue. Over time, the hypoxemia results in tissue break down with loss of bowel integrity. The incidence of mesenteric ischemia is reported to be 0.1 o/o of hospitalized patients, and this number is thought to be increasing as the average age of the population increases. The mortality is more than 60%. Delay in diag\u00ad nosis is common, but with reports that early intervention increases survival rate, it is important to always have this diagnosis in the differential for elderly patients presenting with abdominal pain. Four etiologies of mesenteric ischemia are described, and each has different risk factors and variation in presen\u00ad tation. The most common cause of mesenteric ischemia (SO%), usually owing Arterial thrombosis at the narrowing of mesenteric arteries in patients with atherosclerosis is responsible for 20% of acute presentations. These patients frequently have other forms of atherosclerosis such as coronary artery disease. Mesenteric venous thrombosis, which may be associated with peripheral deep vein thrombosis, accounts for 5-lOo/o of presentations. Nonocclusi ve mesenteric ischemia is seen in up to 20-25% of presentations. It is due to low flow states typically seen in shock syndromes. It occurs most Morbidity and mortality remains very high despite advances in care, and survival is dependent on early recognition and treatment. Obtain early surgical consultation if mesenteric ischemia is suspected. common ly in hospitalized patients and is difficult to diagnose. The mesenteric vessel affected is responsible for the presenting symptoms and area of injury. The superior mesenteric artery (SMA) is the most common ly involved site because of the sharp takeoff of this vessel from the aorta. Approxim ately 80% of mesenteric blood flow supplies the bowel mucosa, making it the most sensitive to ischemia. CLINICAL PRESENTATION ...... History Symptoms are nonspecific and common to many condi\u00ad tions. Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea are frequently seen. Any patient older than 50 years with risk factors ( eg, atrial fibrillation) who experiences acute onset abdominal pain lasting >2 hours should be suspected of having acute mesenteric ischemia. Pain out of proportion to the physical examination is very concerning for mesen\u00ad teric ischemia. Late findings include peritonitis ( eg, pain with movemen t), fever, weakness, and altered mental status. Patients with chronic mesenteric ischemia will give a history of \"abdominal angina'' or pain after eating. This is due to narrowing of the mesenteric artery usually associated 135 CHAPTER 32 with chronic atherosclerosis. With eating there is increased demand for blood flow, causing a relative ischemia until demand is lowered. These patients go on to have throm\u00ad botic occlusion of their narrowed vessels, presenting then with the common acute symptoms . ...... Physical Examination Early physical findings may be nonexistent or nonspe\u00ad cific. A patient complaining of extreme pain who has an essentially normal abdomina l exam (especially no pain on palpation) should prompt consideration of mesen\u00ad teric ischemia. If not diagnosed at this stage, the ischemia progresses to necrosis and perforation. The physical examination will then reveal abdominal distension and peritonitis. Hemoccult positive stools are found in only 25% of cases. DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES ...... Laboratory Lab testing is usually nonspecific and therefore of little help ruling in or excluding the diagnosis. The white blood cell count is frequently high, but this is nonspecific. There is a lack of consensus on the role of lactic acid. It has 100% sensitivity if there is bowel infarction; however, it may be normal early. If elevated at presentati on, it pre\u00ad dicts a higher morbidity and mortality and should prompt an aggressive search for ischemia. An electrocardiogram should be performed to diagnose atrial fibrillation . ..... Imaging The classic reported finding on plain radiographs is \"thumb-printing;' representing bowel wall thickening and edema. However, this is a mid to late finding and is seen in only 40% of patients. Nonspecific findings such as ileus are seen in up to 60% of (CT) much more sensitive and frequently shows bowel edema, lack of arterial flow, or venous thrombus with ischemia. It has become the imaging study of choice in suspected acute mesenteric ischemia (Figure 32-lB). MEDICAL DECISION MAKING Any patient who is part of the \"at risk\" population who presents with moderate to severe abdominal pain should be considered at risk for mesenteric ischemia (Figure 32-2). A lactic acid level should be obtained as soon as possible and the stool should be tested for blood. Involve your sur\u00ad gical consultant early. If the diagnosis is in question, a CT angiogram should be performed. B .A. Figure 32-1. A. Portal venous air, a late finding of mesenteric ischemia, is seen in this patient (arrows). B. Pneumatosis intestinalis demonstrated in a loop of bowel on CT scan (arrow). TREATMENT In the emergency department, aggressive fluid therapy to correct hypotension and hypovolemia is instituted. Central venous access and monitoring may be necessary. Administer broad-spectrum antibiotics in the setting of suspected perforation.

Early surgical consultation has been shown to improve outcomes even in patients ultimately treated nonsurgically. Patients with ischemia due to nonocclusive disease or venous thrombosis are not amenable to surgery, but surgery may be necessary to remove necrotic bowel. There are several nonsurgical management options involving angiography. Infusion of papaverine into the SMA for vasodilation has been reported to improve survival rate. Venous thrombosis is treated with anticoagulation. DISPOSITION All patients with mesenteric ischemia need rapid surgical consult and admission. SUGGESTED READINGS DJ, Heys SD, Brittenden J.

Fever should not be confused with hypertherm ia. Temperatures higher than 41 oc (1 05.8\u00b0F) are almost always due to hyperthermia and not fever. Be thoughtful in your evaluation of fever to avoid misdiagnosing a serious bacterial illness as \"just another viral syndrome.\" INTRODUCTION The human body temperature is controlled within a nar\u00ad row range between 36 and 37.8 \u00b0C (96.8 -100.4\u00b0F). Fever is defined as a core temperature >38\u00b0 C (100.4 \u00b0F) in infants and >38.3\u00b0C (100.9\u00b0F) in adults. It is the result of the body resetting the temperature control center, the hypothala\u00ad mus, in response to infection. Endogenous ( cytokines) and exogenous (bacterial (PGE2) in the hypothalamus. PGE2 raises the hypothalamic temperature set point. The body then generates and conserves heat to reach this new hypothalamic set point, thereby raising the body tempera\u00ad ture. Fever is sustained as long as the levels of pyrogens and PGE2 are elevated. Cyclooxygenase inhibitors decrease fever by blocking the production of PGE2. Fever is one of the most common presenting com\u00ad plaints in the emergency department (ED). It accounts for So/o of adult visits, 15o/o of elderly visits and 40o/o of pediat\u00ad ric visits to the ED. The most important thing to recognize about fever is that it is a symptom, not a disease, and it represents an underlying problem that must be evaluated and treated. The most common sites of infection vary based on age and immune system status. In the elderly and immunosuppressed, respiratory, genitourin ary, and bacterial Provide empiric antib iotics early for moderate to severely ill patients with a possible infectious etiology. Give directed antibiotic treatment in the emergency department to patients with serious focal bacterial infections. skin infections predominate. In younger patients the cause offever is often self-limited and benign (eg, upper respira\u00ad tory infection), but serious focal bacterial infections (eg, meningit is) requiring antibiotics, diagnostic procedures, and admission, must be detected. CLINICAL PRESENTATION History The differential diagnosis for fever is quite broad, but in 85o/o of cases the cause is identified by a thorough history and physical examination. Important historical information includes the onset, magnitude, duration, pattern, any associ\u00ad ated symptoms, travel within the past year, chronic illnesses, recent medication changes, recent hospitalizations, chemo\u00ad therapy, radiothera py, or the presence of indwelling vascular access devices or artificial heart valves. The age and overall health of the patient must be taken into account when tak\u00ad ing the history and making medical decisions. Physical Examination The site of temperature recording should be noted, as rec\u00ad tal temperatures are more accurate and usually 1 oc higher than oral temperatures. Rectal temperature should be 138 Table 33-1. Physical examination in fever. General Neurologic Ear, nose, and throat Chest Abdomen Skin Cachexia or other signs of chronic illness Perform a brief mental status examination. In the elderly, AMS may be the only sign of an occult infection. Examine the tympanic membranes and pharynx for evidence of otitis media or exudative phar\u00ad yngitis. Assess the enlarge\u00ad ment, and meningismus. Auscultate rhonchi), suggesting endo\u00ad carditis, or the rub of pericarditis. Palpate for signs of focal or generalized perito\u00ad nitis. Check for costovertebral angle tender\u00ad ness. Perform a genitourinary examination in males and a pelvic examination in females with abdominal pain. Disrobe the patient and examine for rashes (petechiae of meningococcemia) or focal infection Uoint inflammation, cellulitis, infected ulcers, or abscess). taken in infants, children, and adults with significant tachypnea, tachycardia, or altered mental status (AMS). Heart rate (HR) and respiratory rate (RR) increase as fever rises. An increase in temperature of 1 \u00b0C results in an increase in HR by approximately 10 bpm. The RR may also increase 2-4 breaths/minute per degree Celsius. The elderly and immunosuppressed patients may not mount a febrile response despite serious infection. In most patients, the examination is directed by the patient's symptoms (Table 33-1). Patients with significant alterations in mental status, respiratory distress, and car\u00ad diovascular instability require rapid assessment and stabi\u00ad lization. Once the patient has been stabilized, assess for infectious causes that may be a threat to life ( eg, toxic shock, septic shock, meningitis, peritonitis ). DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES ..... Laboratory In children and the elderly, the highest yield laboratory test will be the urinalysis. It is highly accurate for urinary tract infection . In most cases, a complete blood count (CBC) will be sent to look for an elevated white blood cell (WBC) count, but this test lacks specificity and sensitivity. The WBC count can be normal in cases of severe infection or falsely elevated when no infection is present. The most helpful compone nt of the CBC is the neutrophil count, as it can provide a measure of response to infection or deter\u00ad mine whether a patient is neutropenic and unable to mount a response to infection ( eg, immunocompromised chemotherapy patient ). Gram stains, blood, urine, and FEVER wound cultures can be obtained in the ED. Although not helpful in the ED management of the patient, these studies direct targeted antibiotic therapy in the future. ..... Imaging The chest x-ray is helpful in patients with suspected pneumo\u00ad nia, but may be difficult to interpret in the dehydrated patient or those with underlying pulmonary or cardiovascular disor\u00ad ders. For patients with abdominal pain, a computed tomog\u00ad raphy ( CT) scan of the abdomen can to evaluate for appendicitis, diverticulitis, cholecystitis, and intra-abdominal abscess. A head CT should be performed for patients with focal neurologic findings, seizures, AMS, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/a cquired immune deficiency syndrome or signs of increased intracranial pressure. The administration of antibiotics should not be delayed in patients with suspected meningitis awaiting CT scan results. PROCEDU RES For patients with altered mental status or meningismus, a lumbar puncture should be performed to evaluate the cerebrospinal fluid for infectious causes (see Chapter 5). MEDICAL DECISION MAKING The differential diagnosis for fever is extensive, and the cause can be infectious or noninfecti ous. The majority of causes of fever are infectious (Table 33-2). Noninfectious causes include pulmonary embolism, intracranial syndrome/ serotonin syndrome, malignant hyperthermia, thyroid Table 33-2. Differential diagnosis of infectious causes of fever. Neurologic Respiratory /ear, nose, and throat Cardiovascular Gastrointestinal Genitourinary Skin and soft tissue Blood borne Meningitis, immunode\u00ad ficiency virus, malaria CHAPTER 33 History & physical exam Obvious source: appropriate antibiotics, antipyretics, hydration No source: CBC, blood, urine, wound, indwelling line, CSF cultures as indicated, UA, CXR, empiric antibiotics, admission Figure 33-1. Fever diagnostic algorithm. AMS, altered mental status; CBC, spinal UA, urinalysis. storm, transfusion reaction, malignan cy, autoimmune dis\u00ad orders, or drug fever. Use the history and physical examination to make deci\u00ad sions about testing and treatment. If the patient is stable and there is an obvious source of infection, antipyretics should be given and antibiotics when appropriate. In the hemody\u00ad namically unstable patient, intravenous fluid resuscitation should be initiated along with monitoring, respiratory sup\u00ad port, and antipyretics (see Chapter 34). Empiric antibiotic treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics should be started immediately in the ED for unstable patients if an obvious source cannot be found (Figure 33-1). TREATMENT Antipyretics (eg, acetaminophen or ibuprofen) are adminis\u00ad tered to increase patient comfort and reduce the metabolic demand. Patients who are stable can be treated with hydra\u00ad tion and appropriate antibiotics. Patients with signs and symptoms of shock ( eg, AMS, hypotension, tachycardia) require monitoring and aggressive fluid resuscitation. Patients with signs of respiratory compromise or airway obstruction may require intubation. In critically ill or immunocompromised patients, administer antibiotic ther\u00ad apy early. If there is no known source of infection, adminis\u00ad ter broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy to cover aerobic (gram-positive and gram-negative) and anaerobic organ\u00ad isms. The choice of antibiotic is based on the most likely cause of the fever as well as patient considerations such as neutropenia. Antibiotic dosing may be altered in patients with renal insufficiency or in patients with specific condi\u00ad tions (eg, bacterial meningitis ). immunocompromised neonate), have or have serious comorbidities ( eg, pneumonia and congestive heart failure) should be admitted to the hospital for further stabilization and treatment. Admission may also be warranted in patients with no obvious source of infection, but signs of serious illness. ..... Discharge Young healthy patients without comorbidities or serious focal infections can usually be discharged home with close follow-up. FEVER SUGGESTED READING Bentley DW.

Engineer, MD Key Points Identification of the septic patient is the important first step. All other critical actions are missed if this does not occur. Lactate measurement is critical to determining sepsis severity, response to therapy, and prognosis. INTRODUCTION Sepsis is now defined as \"infection plus systemic mani \u00ad festations of infection\" (Table 34-1). Systemic inflamma\u00ad tory response syndrome is no longer a strict criteria. There are 3 sepsis syndromes (stages): uncomplica ted sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock. Sepsis becomes severe sepsis when there is tissue hypoperfusion or organ dysfunction (Table 34-2). Septic shock is defined as a systolic blood pressure (SBP) <90 mmHg or 40 mmHg below one's baseline blood pressure, despite two 20-to 30-mL/kg boluses. Sepsis affects 751,000 patients per year, with an annual mortality that exceeds that of AIDS and breast cancer and approaches that of myocardial infarction. The lungs, abdomen, and urinary tract are the most frequent source of infection, but sepsis can come from anywhere in the body. In approximately 20% of cases, the etiology cannot be determined. Risk factors for the development of sepsis syndromes are extremes of age, immunosup \u00ad pression (chemotherapy, organ transplan tation, steroid use, HIV, etc.), severe comorbid disease, exposure to multiple drug-resistant organisms, vascular catheters and other indwelling devices, intravenous (IV) drug abuse, trauma, and burns. Early administration of appropriate antimicrobials and early goal-directed therapy are the mainstays of treatment. Resuscitation of the critically ill septic patient should occur concurrent or before diagnostic evaluation. CLINICAL PRESENTATION ..... History Any patient presenting with an infectious syndrome should be considered for potential sepsis. Those at the extremes of age or the immunosuppressed may not mount a fever. Other patients may have defervescenced before triage vital signs. High clinical suspicion will be required in properly identify\u00ad ing these patients. Furthermore, patients with reduced physiologic reserve are at risk for rapid clinical deterioration. History should elicit the source of infection. Straight\u00ad forward complaints include cough, purulent phlegm, headache with stiff neck, dysuria, or rashes. More subtle cues include fluctuating mentation suggesting delirium; rigors suggest influenza, pneumonia, and biliary sepsis; and fevers shortly after administration of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) suggest central line infection. ..... Physical Examination As with all potentially unstable patients, airway, breathing, and circulation (ABCs) should be assessed on arrival. Vital signs should be assessed next, remembering that lack of fever does not exclude infectious etiology. Tachycardia may be a response to fever, or it may represent a physiologic 142 Table 34-1.

(That's 4-6 L for a 100-kg patient!) Patients, family members, and electronic medical records can be useful in determining baseline blood pressures. A detailed physical exam starts with general appear\u00ad ance, head and neck, respirato ry, cardiovascular, abdominal, genitourin ary, integument, and neurologic exam. Particular attention should be paid to mental status. Delirium is char\u00ad acterized by inattention, altered level of consciousness, and change in cognition. These symptoms tend to fluctuate over periods of time. DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES The purpose of diagnostic studies is to (1) determine the presence and etiology of sepsis and (2) assess the severity and response to therapy. A patient with focal symptom\u00ad atology (fever, cough, purulent sputum) may need only focused evaluation (chest x-ray). The discussion that fol\u00ad lows assumes the presentation is more nebulous. ..... Laboratory A typical diagnostic work-up for the presence and etiology of sepsis involves assessment for leukocytosis or leukope\u00ad nia (complete blood count), two blood cultures, and uri\u00ad nalysis. Blood cultures should be performed before administration of antimicrobials, with at least one from a peripheral site. Each vascular access device should have one blood culture drawn. Other laboratory assessments, such as wound cultures, synovial fluid, peritoneal fluid, and CHAPTER 34 cerebrospinal fluid, should be obtained when clinical sus\u00ad picion indicates. Because severe sepsis is defined by organ failure, look for evidence of acute kidney injury, shock liver (elevated bilirubin ), Pa02 measurement compared with Fi02 may be useful in determining the presence of acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Patients with sepsis should undergo risk stratification. This begins with initial lactate assessment with levels >4 mmol!L diagnostic for severe sepsis. Although arterial and venous samples are nearly equivalent, lactate is ideally measured at the bedside. In the time it takes for blood to travel to the lab, blood cells undergo anaerobic metabo\u00ad lism, causing false elevations. Repeat measurement should occur after treatment or after 6 hours. Clearance of lactate (delta lactate) of 10% or greater indicates a significant reduction in mortality, whereas no change may signify a 60% mortality. ..... Imaging Chest radiographs are typically included for most septic patients when the presentation is concerning or the etiol\u00ad ogy is uncertain. Targeted imaging should be considered based on clinical presentation ( eg, computed tomography scan of the abdomen/pelvis in the febrile patient with abdominal pain and recent surgery for Crohn disease to assess for potential abscess). PROCEDURES Targeted diagnostic procedures should be considered when indicated, such as lumbar puncture for suspected meningi\u00ad tis or arthrocentesis for suspected septic joint. Invasive central monitoring such as central line placement, arterial line, and urinary catheterization is indicated when there is evidence of acute end- organ fail\u00ad ure, lactate 4 mmol/L, or shock. MEDICAL DECISION MAKING The initial step is to determine who is at risk for infection. Next, determine the sepsis severity through clinical assess\u00ad ment, point of care lactate, laboratory assessment for end\u00ad organ injury, and blood pressure response to fluid resuscitation. Patients with uncomplicated sepsis should have investigation to determine the infectious source and be treated with antimicrobials and fluids. Patients with severe sepsis and septic shock should receive early aggressive resuscitation, including early anti\u00ad microbial therapy and early goal-directed therapy (EGDT). Resuscitation should occur concurrent to the diagnostic evaluation, not after it (Figure 34-1). TREATMENT Antibiotics should be administered as early as possible, preferably within 1 hour of recognition of septic shock. Cultures should be obtained before antibiotics, but should not delay their administration when plausible. Every hour delay decreases survival by 7.5% in the hypotensive patient. Initial empiric choice of antibiotics should be against likely pathogens. This can generally be determined by identifying the target organ of infection (eg, lung), setting that the infection was acquired (eg, nursing home), and bacterial susceptibilities within your hospital (the local antibiogram is often available on hospital's internal website). Patients with severe sepsis or septic shock with a lactate >4 mmol/L or hypotension unresp onsive to fluids should receive a bundle of therapies referred to as EGDT. These patients should have a central line and Foley catheter placed for monitoring. An arterial line may also be neces\u00ad sary to accurately measure blood pressure. The goals of this approach include optimizing preload, afterload, and central venous oxygen saturation (Scv02) in a stepwise approach. Preload is addressed with fluid resuscitation in the form of 1,000 mL crystalloid boluses administered over 30 minutes and repeated as necessary to achieve a central venous pressure of 8-12 mmHg. Once achieved, afterload is treated with vasopressors (norepi\u00ad nephrine or dopamine) to raise the mean arterial pressure to65 mmHg. Scv02 is a measurement of oxygen saturation in blood returning to the superior vena cava. When low, either the body is delivering inadequate oxygen or the tissues need to extract a large amount to correct their oxygen debt. The goal is to achieve a Scv02 70%. Oxygen delivery (D02) can be augmented by administering additional oxygen (maximize the pulse oximetry) , increasing oxygen carrying capacity with blood transfusions to a hematocrit of 30%, and increasing oxygen delivery by \"whipping\" the heart with dobutarnine for greater inotropy. If that is unsuccess\u00ad ful, then oxygen utilization (V02) can be reduced by sedating, paralyzing, and intubating the patient. A decrease in post-treatment lactate by 10% has been shown to be equivalent to achieving a Scv02 70%, utilizing the same treatment algorithm. There are conflicting data on the benefits of steroids in septic shock. Hydrocortisone may be considered in adult patients who are vasopressor refractory or who are steroid dependent. Lastly, source control involves removal of the nidus of infection when possible ( eg, removal of infected central lines or drainage of abscesses). DISPOSITION .....

Figure 34-1. Sepsis diagnostic algorithm. CHAPTER 34 hypotension requiring vasopressors, or respiratory fail\u00ad ure requiring ventilato ry support should be admitted to an intensive care unit. Other patients may be admitted to general medical floor or step down, dep ending on the nursing ratios and capabilities of that particular unit. Discharge A minority of sepsis patients may be discharged. Typically, these are young, healthy patients without tissue hypoperfu\u00ad sion or end-organ failure who have normalized their vital signs and have self-limited infections or infections that are rapidly responsive to antimicrobial therapy. Viral pharyngitis, strep throat, and pyelonephritis are examples of infections that often may enable the patient to be discharged to home. SUGGESTED READING Booker E.

Fitch, MD Key Points The classic triad of meningitis includes fever, neck stiff\u00ad ness, and altered mental status. However, all 3 of these are present less than half of patients with bacterial meningitis. Patients who are very young, very old, or immuno\u00ad compromised may present with atypical signs and symptoms. Empiric antibio tics should not be delayed while waiting for a computed tomography (CT) scan before a lumbar INTRODUCTION Bacterial meningitis and viral encepha litis are life\u00ad threatening causes of infection and inflammation within the central nervous system (CNS). In the early stages of illness the diagnosis can be very challenging, and evalua\u00ad tion is focused on identifying patients who require urgent diagnostic testing and treatment. Until antibiotics became available at the beginning of the 20th century, bacterial meningitis was nearly 100% fatal. Morbidity and mortality still remain high even with appro\u00ad priate treatment. Meningitis affects patients of all ages, but those at the extremes of age or immunosuppressed are at increased risk. Accurate diagnosis, timely administration of antibiotics, and other adjunctive therapies (eg, dexametha\u00ad sone) are important for patients with suspected bacterial disease. Meningitis is an inflammatory process of the mem\u00ad branes that surround the brain and spinal cord. The most common causative agents of bacterial meningitis are commonly infects patients (>50 years old), infants puncture (LP) if meningitis is a likely diagnosis. When a CT scan is necessary, draw blood cultures and administer steroids and appropriate antibiotics before the LP. Consider the diagnosis of herpes simplex virus encepha\u00ad litis in patients with focal neurologic findings or altered mental status and add intravenous acyclovir to the empiric antimicrobial regimen. ( <3 months old), and immunoc ompromised or pregnant individuals. These pathogens often invade the host through the upper airway by infecting the mucosa and bloodstream and ultimately cross the blood-brain barrier, entering the CNS. CNS inoculation can also occur after trauma, surgery, or a contiguous infection such as sinusitis or otitis media. Changes in epidemiology have mirrored vaccination practices in children and adults against Haemophilus influ\u00ad enzae, S. pneumoni ae, and N. meningitidis. Routine child\u00ad hood vaccination against H. influenza type b has helped decrease this pathogen as a cause of meningitis. Use of the pneumoco ccal vaccine in adults may be reducing the rate of S. pneumoniae disease. Given the success of routine childhood vaccination programs, over the past 25 years, the median age of a patient diagnosed with meningitis has risen from 15 months to 42 years of age. Aseptic meningitis is due to inflammation from other causes such as drugs, rheumatologic conditions, or non\u00ad bacterial infections. Most cases are caused by viral (the most common overall causes of meningitis) or mycobacte\u00ad rial infections. Of the viral etiologies, enteroviruses and echoviruses are the most common, but herpes simplex virus (HSV) is an important pathogen. 147 CHAPTER 35 Encephalitis is an infection of the brain parenchyma causing inflammation within the CNS. Viral pathogens include HSV, which is the most treatable cause of encepha\u00ad litis. In the acute care setting, it can be difficult to distin\u00ad guish encephalitis from severe cases of bacterial meningitis, as patients' signs and symptoms may be similar. CLINICAL PRESENTATION .... History The classic triad of meningitis includes fever, neck stiff\u00ad ness, and altered mental status, but all of these are present together in less than half of adult patients with bacterial meningitis. Patients may also experience seizure. Many of the symptoms are nonspecific, such as headache, nausea and vomiting, and neck pain, making accurate diagnosis challenging. Patients at the extremes of age and those who are immunocompromised can be further difficult to diag\u00ad nose, as they can have more subtle presentations or even lack fever. Infants may present with only irritabilit y, leth\u00ad argy, poor feeding, rash, or a bulging fontanelle. Seizures may be present in up to one third of pediatric patients with bacterial meningitis. Geriatric patients can often present with confusion or altered mental status. The clini\u00ad cal presentation of patients with encephalitis can be simi\u00ad lar to patients with meningitis, including fever, headache, or stiff neck, but the diagnosis of encephalitis is character\u00ad ized by the presence of altered mental status or neurologic symptoms. .... Physical Examination Although not all patients with meningitis will have fever, it is a common physical finding. Classically described men\u00ad ingeal findings include nuchal rigidity (severe neck stiff\u00ad ness due to meningeal irritation), Kernig sign (flexing the hip and extending the knee to elicit pain in the back and the legs) and Brudzinski sign (passive flexion of the neck elicits flexion of the hips). However, these findings cannot be relied on exclusively, as they have relatively poor sensi\u00ad tivities. Neck stiffness may only be present 30% of the time in patients with meningitis. Petechiae and purpura are classically associated with meningococcal meningitis; how\u00ad ever, these skin findings can be present with other bacterial causes or may be absent. Altered mental status and focal neurologic findings should raise concern for encephalitis as a possible diagnosis. DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES .... Laboratory Evaluation of the CSF is most critical. Initial CSF labora\u00ad tory studies include cell count and differential, protein and glucose levels, and a Gram stain and bacterial culture. Other CSF studies to consider may include HSV or entero\u00ad virus polymerase chain reaction, bacterial antigen testing, or specialized fungal testing. Additional CSF studies may be ordered for immunocompromised patients. Other studies include a complete blood count, serum glucose and electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen and creati\u00ad nine, and C-reactive protein. Most laboratory studies are nonspecific for meningitis or encephalitis, although a blood culture drawn before empiric antibiotics when meningitis is likely can be helpful to identify bacterial pathogens. .... Imaging and Procedures A prompt lumbar puncture (LP) is the preferred diagnostic procedure in patients with suspected bacterial meningitis or encephalitis. A computed tomography scan of the brain before LP should be considered under the following circum\u00ad stances: altered mental status, new-onset seizures, an immu\u00ad nocompromised state, focal neurologic signs, or papilledema. Neuroimaging is intended to identify patients with possible contraindications to LP such as an occult mass from infec\u00ad tion, brain tumor, or signs of brain shift or herniation. MEDICAL DECISION MAKING The initial history and physical exam are important for guid\u00ad ing diagnostic decisions and initiating emergent therapy when indicated for patients with suspected bacterial meningitis or encephalitis. Elevated numbers of white blood cells in the CSF obtained by LP are diagnostic for meningitis or encephalitis, although it can be a challenge to determine whether the cause is more likely bacterial or nonbacterial in etiology. CSF findings suggestive of bacterial meningitis include the following: Positive Gram stain with identified organism Glucose <40 mgldL or ratio of opening pressure of CSF during LP (pres\u00ad sure reading must be obtained with patient in the lateral decubitus position) See Table 35-1 for classically described CSF findings in bacterial, viral, and fungal meningitis. Although these Table 35-1. Classically described CSF findings in bacterial, viral, and fungal meningitis.

CSF studies for patients with encephalitis will lead to similarly abnormal results, with increased numbers of white blood cells in the CSF, generally with a lymphocytic predomi\u00ad nance. Results may also reveal increased numbers of red blood cells in the CSF owing to neuronal cell death leading to edema, hemorrhage, and necrosis when encephalitis is present. TREATMENT For patients with suspected bacterial meningitis, empiric IV antibiotic therapy and admission to the hospital is recom\u00ad mended (Table 35-2). Recommendations for pediatric patients are based on patient age. For neonates less than 1 month, empiric IV therapy includes ampicillin and cefo\u00ad taxirne (alternative is ampicillin and gentamici n). Children 1 to 3 months should be given ampicillin and cefotaxirne, Table 35-2. Recommended empiric therapy for adults with suspected bacterial meningitis.''' Patient Age IV Empiric Therapy* Adults <SO years Ceftriaxone cefotaxime and vancomycin 2:50 years Ceftriaxone or cefotaxime and vancomycin and ampicillin Readers should consult local infectious disease specialists for recommended empiric antibiotic therapy in your local region. ''Remember to add acyclovir in cases of possible HSV encephalitis. CHAPTER 35 and for those older than 3 months, empiric therapy includes ampicillin or ceftriaxone, and vancomycin. Patients with severe disease may require intensive care unit level care depending on the clinical circumstances. The role of adjunctive dexameth asone for patients with bacterial meningitis remains somewhat uncertain, as recent work has questioned the value of this treatment that had previously been strongly recommended to reduce mortality and poor neurologic outcomes. For patients in high-income countries, there may be benefit to treatment with IV dexamethasone that is initiated before or at the same time as antibiotic treatment. In patients with suspected bacterial meningitis who need a CT scan of the brain before LP, blood cultures should be drawn and empiric antimicrobial therapy admin\u00ad istered before CT to avoid additional delays to beginning treatment. The treatment for most cases of encephalitis is support\u00ad ive care. HSV encephalitis is the only cause of this disease with a specific treatment: N acyclovir. DISPOSITION .... Admission Patients who are diagnosed with bacterial meningitis or viral encephalitis should be admitted to the hospital for monitoring, N antimicrobial agents, and other adjunctive therapies. There may be clinical ambiguity regarding dispo\u00ad sition for patients who are clinically well appearing but have mildly elevated white blood cell levels in the CSF suggestive of aseptic meningitis. One option for such patients may include hospital admission for observation with or without empiric antibiotic therapy, pending CSF culture results. ..... Discharge In some circumstances, patients with suspected viral men\u00ad ingitis may be appropriate for outpatient management with close follow-up and strict return precautions. When considering discharge home for outpatient management of presumed viral meningitis, it is important to assess the patient's support system, reliability, availability of close follow-up, and mechanisms for contacting the patient if CSF culture results are unexpectedly positive.

Deiorio, MD Key Points Most cases of cellulitis can be safely managed as outpatien ts with oral antibiotics, elevation, and recheck in 24-48 hours. All abscesses require drainage. Most patients can be safely discharged without antibiotics, but do need a recheck in 48 hours. Patients who are systemically ill or immune compromised require intravenous (IV) antibiotics, laboratory and imaging studies, and admission. INTRODUCTION Soft tissue infections represent a common complaint in the emergency department (ED). The term \"soft tissue infection'' refers to an infection of the skin and underlying tissue. It is the emergency physician's objective to distinguish superficial infections (cellulitis, erysipelas, or abscess) from deep infec\u00ad tions. If deep infections, such as necrotizing fasciitis, are not emergently diagnosed, they can cause significant morbidity and mortality. Cellulitis is a progressive bacterial infection of the der\u00ad mis and subcutaneous fat that is associated with leukocytic infiltration and capillary dilation (seen as erythema). It is caused by bacterial invasion of the skin, most often by Staphylococcus aureus, -hemolytic strepto coccus, and gram-negative Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is quickly becoming a common infecting agent in many community-acquired cases of cellulitis and abscesses. Erysipelas is a skin infection that involves the lymphatic drainage system. Primarily, it is caused by invasion of the skin by Staphylococcus pyogenes in areas with impaired 151 Patients with pain out of proportion to physical exam find\u00ad ings, crepitus, or rapidly spreading erythema may have a life-threatening necrotizing infection requiring aggressive work-up, broad-spectrum IV antibiotics, and immediate surgical consultation for operative debridement. lymphatic drainage. It is common in infants, children, and older adults. It is usually found on the lower extremities (70%) or face (20%). The characteristic presentation is painful erythematous raised lesions, which may look like an orange peel. Red streaking representing inflammation of the underlying lymphatics may also be present. Abscesses are localized pyogenic infections that can occur in any part of the body. Approximately 2% of all adult visits to the ED are for the treatment of cutaneous abscesses. Bacteria that normally colonize the skin are often the cause, with S. aureus being the most common organism involved. Mixed infections (aerobes and anaer\u00ad obes) usually occur in the perineal areas. Necrotizing infections are life and limb-threatening infections that involve the skin, subcutaneous tissue, fascia, and muscle. They usually occur in the setting of skin trauma, surgical procedures, decubitus ulcers, and immune compro\u00ad mise. These deadly infections are caused by a mixture of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in most cases. Commonly isolated bacteria include S. aureus, S. pyogenes (ie, \"flesh\u00ad eating bacteria\" \"gas gangrene\" ). CLINICAL PRESENTATION History CHAPTER 36 Ask about the time course and presence of systemic symptoms. Rapidly progressive infections with systemic symptoms require aggressive care in the ED. Patients should be asked about trauma (including bites, scratches, and possible foreign bodies), as it is the most common risk factor for developing a soft tissue infection. Other risk factors include obesity, malnu\u00ad trition, immune compromise, intravenous (N) drug use, vascular or lymphatic insufficien cy, surgical procedures, and decubitus ulcers. The past medical history can be relevant, as anything that depresses the immune system ( eg, steroids, diabetes, immunosuppr essive drugs, elderly) predisposes the patient to soft tissue infections and may mask the severity of illness. Also, the status of tetanus immunization and previous antibiotic allergies should be ascertained. Physical Examination Vitals signs provide rapid clues to the severity of infection. Tachycardia and hypotension may indicate sepsis. Fever is not reliable, as it occurs in <10% of patients with simple cellulitis or abscess. ( D ..&. Figure 36-1. A. Cellulitis of the left leg. B. Lymphangitis of the arm in a patient with a hand infection. C. Necrotizing fasciitis of the lower extremity. This patient required amputation of the leg to treat his infection. Courtesy of Kevin jones, MD. D. Fournier's gangrene extending up the back of a patient. The skin examination is crucial, and it is important to completely undress the patient to examine the involved body part. Assess the involved area for erythema, warmth, edema, and tenderness (Figure 36-lA). Lack of tenderness helps differentiate infections from other causes of skin SOFT TISSUE INFECTIONS erythema and warmth, such as venous stasis. Evidence of lymphatic spread in the form of red lines tracking proximally from the wound, called lymphangitis, further suggests an infectious etiology (Figure 36-lB). Focal areas of fluctuance and induration may indicate abscess formation. Marking the extent of erythema on the patient with a pen will allow for comparison on repeat examinations. Rapid extension is concerning for a necrotizing infection (Figures 36-lC and D). Crepitus suggests gas formation in the tissues and is a sign of a more serious necrotizing infec\u00ad tion. It is important to remember that necrotizing soft tis\u00ad sue infections often present with severe pain but may have few findings on physical exam. The absence of crepitus does not rule out a deep space infection. Distal pulses should be examined to assess for arterial insufficiency. DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES ...... Laboratory The diagnosis of simple cellulitis, erysipelas, or an abscess is clinical. Basic laboratory studies, such as a complete blood count or basic metabolic panel, are of little benefit. However, they should be considered if there is a suspicion of necrotizing infection, immune compromise, a history suggestive of hyperglycemia/metabolic abnormalities, or systemic symptoms. A C-reactive protein may also be use\u00ad ful when considering a necrotizing infection, as it will be significantly elevated. Gram stain and wound culture should be obtained in patients with suspected MRSA abscess and necrotizing infections, as it will guide future antibiotic therapy. Routine blood cultures add little to the diagnosis and treatment of soft tissue infections . ..... Imaging Ultrasound is becoming more frequently utilized in the ED for the diagnosis of cutaneous abscesses. It is fast, readily available at the bedside, and can easily localize an abscess for incision and drainage (Figure 36-2A). Ultrasound is also more sensitive than plain radiographs for soft tissue A B ( Figure 36-2. A. Ultrasound of a cutaneous abscess. The abscess cavity is hypoechoic with mixed internal echogenicit y.

CT scan in a patient with necrotizing fasciitis of the abdominal wall (arrow). air. Plain radiographs are helpful to evaluate for traumatic injury, osteomyelitis, and the presence of gas formation (Figure 36-2B). However, radiographs are insensitive for small amounts of air. Computed tomography scan remains the most sensitive for soft tissue air, deep space abscesses, and foreign bodies (Figure 36-2C). CHAPTER 36 PROCEDU RES For a description of abscess incision and drainage, see Chapter 1. MEDICAL DECISION MAKING Most of the time, a good history and physical examination are all that is needed to make the diagnosis of a soft tissue infection . A patient with cellulitis will likely present with a history of an injury to the skin who then develops superfi\u00ad cial erythema, warmth, swelling, and pain. A thorough history and physical will allow differentiation of cellulitis from other diagnoses such as thrombophlebitis, viral and drug exanthems, dermatitis, allergic reactions, insect bites, lymphedema, or fungal infections. Sometimes a cutaneous abscess can be present along with superficial cellulitis. In these cases, bedside ultrasound becomes useful in determining whether a pus collection has developed underneath the skin. The differential diagnosis for abscess includes cutaneous cysts, t urnors, foreign body granu\u00ad vascular malformations (especially in the axilla and groin). Knowing of an abscess (erythema, in dura\u00ad tion, fluctuance, and a focal area of pain) becomes important, as only an abscess will have all of those features. If a necrotizing infection (presence of pain out of pro\u00ad portion to exam, crepitus, bullae formation, skin slough\u00ad ing, or systemic toxicity) is suspected, it becomes vital that an urgent CT scan is ordered to assess for gas and the extent of infectious involvement. A necrotizing infection requires prompt identification, consultation, and treat\u00ad ment (Figure 36-3). History & physical exam Cellulitis: superficial erythema, warmth, swelling, pain Systemic symptoms , immunocomprom ise, extensive involvement No: DC with PO antibiotics, elevate and recheck in 24-48 hr Yes: Lab studies, consider imaging, and admit for IV antibiotics Abscess: focal area of pain, redness, fluctuance, and induration No: All get I&D in ED: wound cultures if suspected MRSA or necrotizing infection Systemic symptoms , immunocomprom ise, extensive involvement Yes: DC with packing removal in 24-48 hr Lab studies, imaging, and admit for IV antibiotics Figure 36-3. Soft tissue infections diagnostic algorithm. DC, discharge; ED, I&D, incision and drainage; IV, intravenous; MRSA, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. SOFT TISSUE INFECTIONS TREATMENT Cellulitis is treated with antibiotics. If there is systemic toxicity, immune compromise, or involvement of high-risk areas (hands, face, perineum, or circumferential extremity) the patient should receive IV antibiotics and admission. If none of the above is present, the patient can be discharged with oral antibiotics (7-to 10-day course) and instructions to be rechecked in 2 days. Incision and drainage (I&D) is the treatment of choice for an abscess, most of which do not require antibiotics after I&D. The abscess should be packed and a recheck scheduled in 1-2 days. Indications for the addition of anti\u00ad biotics include systemic symptoms, extensive surrounding cellulitis, or immune compromise. Treatment of a necrotizing infection involves prompt fluid resuscitation and N antibiotics. Consultation with a general surgeon should be performed for emergent debridement to stop the advancement of the infection . Empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage should be initiated. Piperacillin/tawbactam with vancomycin and ciprofloxacin is the initial treatment of choice, as it covers mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria that are often involved. Vancomycin is being used because high rates of MRSA resistance to clindamycin have been found. However, clindamycin is often added to the preceding regimen, as it has been shown to have bacterial toxin sup\u00ad pressive properties. DISPOSITION ..... Admission Patients with cellulitis or abscesses should be admitted if there is an extensive area of involvement or if they are systemically ill, have significant comorbid illness, or are immune- compromised. All patients with necrotizing infections should be admitted to an intensive care unit for broad-sp ectrum antibiotic therapy after surgical debridement. ..... Discharge Patients with cellulitis or a drained abscess with limited area of involvement, no or minimal systemic symptoms, and no significant comorbidities may be discharged.

Human Immunodeficiency Virus Sorabh Khandelwal, MD john Davis, MD Key Points A high index of suspicion is needed for the initial diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), particularly in the context of atypical presenting symptoms. Consider acute HIV in the patient who presents with a mononucleo sis-like infection, but with negative monospot testing. CD4 T-cell count is correlated with risk for opportunistic infection. INTRODUCTION Human immuno deficiency virus (HIV) is a cytopathic retrovirus that attacks the CD4 T-lympho cytes in the immune system. Acquired immuno deficiency syndrome (AIDS) occurs when HIV-induced loss of CD4 cells and the resulting immunosuppression permit infection from opportunistic pathogens. AIDS is def med as a CD4 count <200/j..lL, a CD4 percentage cytomegalovirus (CMV), among others. In the United States, approximately 1.2 million persons are infected with HIV, with up to 50,000 new cases every year. The estimated prevalence of HN-positive patients seen in urban emergency departments (EDs) may be as high as 11.4%. Up to 20% of all HN-positive persons in the United States are unaware of their HN status. Risk factors for HN acquisition include sexual activ\u00ad ity, injection drug use, blood transfusion (particularly before screening of the donor pool commenced in 1985), All patients with HIV and respiratory complaints, espe\u00ad cially those with CD4 <200 cells/I-ll should be placed in negative pressure/airborne isolation until the diagnosis of tuberculosis can be excluded. With appropriate care and proper managemen t, people living with HIV can live a normal lifespan. intrapartum/neonatal exposure to a mother with HIV, and occupational exposure (break of skin with contarni \u00ad nated sharps or Acute retroviral syndrome (ARS) occurs in approxi\u00ad mately 50% of acutely infected patients, approximately 2-4 weeks after exposure to HN, and may clinically mani\u00ad fest as a flu-like or mononucl eosis-like illness. Regardless of the presence or absence of ARS, most patients have a high viral load (> 106 copies/cm 3) during this period, and nega\u00ad tive serologic tests. Seroconversion typically occurs 2-6 weeks (though sometimes up to 6 months) after exposure. An immune response to the virus is then generated, and the viral load falls to a setpoint with a relatively stable CD4 count. This leads to a period of clinical latency (usually 2-10 years) during which CD4 T-cells are continually destroyed and regenerated, and viral replication continues. Ultimately, immune control is ineffective, and the CD4 count falls, leading to increased susceptibility to opportu\u00ad nistic (as well as other) infection. Some CD4 cutoffs are associated with increased risk of certain infections <200 with clinician should be aware that infec\u00ad tions may occur at a higher than anticipated CD4 levels. 156 HUMAN IMMUNODEFICI ENCY VIRUS CLINICAL PRESENTATION History All patients presenting to the ED with complaints of infec\u00ad tions should be asked about their HN status, if they have been tested, and about pertinent risk factors. Patients with unknown HN status, significant risk factors, and symp\u00ad toms consistent with an opportunistic infection should be assumed to be immunosuppressed. Patients with known HN should be asked about their latest CD4 count, viral load, medications (including prophyla xis), and history of any opportunistic infections or recent hospitalizations. Patients with counts >500/!!L are at lower risk for oppor\u00ad tunistic infections. Some aspects of the history are particularly important for specific, symptomatic presentations in those who are infected with HIV. Fever. Pulmonary and CNS infections are the chief causes of fever, but infections at these sites may occasion \u00ad ally present without localizing symptoms. Respiratory complaints. Any pulmonary complaint should raise suspicion fur pneumonia or TB. Patients should be asked about prior episodes of PCP or TB. They should also be questioned about the use of prophylactic medications (eg, trimethoprim-su lfamethoxazole) for PCP. The presence of oral candidiasis patient with shortness of breath sug\u00ad gests PCP. Neurologic complaints. New or worsening headache with CD4 count <200/!!L suggests central nervous system ( CNS) meningi \u00ad tis) visual loss occurs with CMV retinitis. Gastrointestinal complaints. Difficulty swallowing occurs with candidal esophagitis, and failure to improve with fluconazole (Ditlucan) suggests CMV or herpes esophagitis. Acute diarrhea may be caused by bacteria ( eg, Salmonell a), whereas chronic diarrhea may Pancreatitis and kidney stones most often occur as a result of antiretroviral therapy. Physical Examination A comprehensive physical examination may not only help provide a general picture of the overall health of the patient, it can also help identify the source for any acute presenting complaint. Some key systems to examine include: Vital signs. History of fever at home requires a work\u00ad up, even if the patient is afebrile in the ED. Tachypnea and hypoxia suggest PCP. General appearance. Assess for respiratory distress. Wasting, dehydration, and parietal hair loss are common in patients with advanced AIDS. Head and neck. Assess visual acuity and perform funduscopic examination for possible CMV retinitis (\"ketchup and mayo\" retinal findings). Perform oral examination for Figure 37\u00b71. Photograph showing patient with oral candidiasis. candidiasis (thrush) and oral hairy leukoplakia (Figure 37-1). Assess for lymphadenopathy or meningismus. Pulmonary. Auscultate for rales, rhonchi, or wheezes; however, many patients with PCP will have normal breath sounds. Cardiovascular. Listen for new murmurs, suggesting endocarditis, especially in the N drug user. Gastrointestinal. Examine for evidence of peritonitis, pancreatitis, or hepatobiliary disease, which may occur sec\u00ad ondary to acute infection or antiretroviral medications. Neurologic. Assess mental status and any focal deficits (present in up to 60o/o of patients with toxoplasmosis, though absent in many cases of cryptococcal meningit is). Skin. Examine for Kaposi sarcoma, cellulitis, abscesses, evidence of disseminated infection (endocarditis, fungal disease, dMAC), or drug reactions. DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES Laboratory Complete Blood Count. Use the absolute lymphocyte count as a correlation for the CD4 count. If the CD4 count is unknown, an absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) can be used to predict the CD4 count. The ALC is equal to the total white blood cell count multiplied by the percentage of lym\u00ad phocytes. An ALC of< 1,000/!!L predicts a CD4 An ALC >2,000/!!L predicts a CD4 count >200/!!L. CHAPTER 37 Chemistr y. Useful in patients with prolonged diarrhea, dehydration, or wasting to assess glucose level, electrolytes, and renal function. Can be helpful in patients presenting with abdominal pain to check for lactic acido sis. Liver profile, lipase, lactate dehydrogenase. abdominal pain and jaundice. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is also useful in patients with suspected PCP. Elevation > 220 IU /L in patients with shortness of breath suggests PCP (94% sensitive), and a normal LDH level suggests an alterna\u00ad tive diagnosis. Blood cultures. In patients with a fever without a source and for suspected serious bacterial (including mycobacterial ), viral, or fungal infections. Urine. Obtain a urinalysis and urine culture in all febrile patients without a source. Many AIDS patients have urinary tract infections without localizing symptoms. The urinary histoplasma antigen can be useful in detecting dis\u00ad seminated histoplasmosis. StooL Check for leukocytes, (including microsporidia, Cryptosporidium , Isospora, and Cyclospora) in patients with diarrhea or bloody stools. Some causes of diarrhea may require biopsy for diagnosis. Blood gas. An arterial blood gas should be performed for patients with pulmonary complaints. Patients with PCP and an elevated A-a gradient (>35 mmHg) or low Pa02 ( room air) are candidates for adjunc\u00ad tive steroid therapy. Viral load. Rarely used emergently to establish risk of opportunistic infection. .... Imaging Chest x-ray. All HN-positive patients with pulmonary symptoms or fever without a source.

In patients with new headache or fever, especially in patients with CD4 count <200/mL. CT before lwnbar puncture (LP) is recommended in all patients with HIV to rule out mass lesion and increased intracranial pressure. Check opening pressure (particularly important for cryptococcal meningitis ). Routine studies (cell count with differential, total protein, glucose) should be sent. Additional cerebrospinal fluid studies performed in HIV patients include India ink (Cryptococcus ), viral and fungal VDRL for neurosyphilis. MEDICAL DECISION MAKING The medical decision- making process is especially depen\u00ad dent on the presenting symptoms in a patient with HIV. Fever. Although fever in the HIV-positive patient with preserved CD4 count (>500) may be benign, the likeli\u00ad hood that fever represents opportunistic infection goes up markedly with lower CD4 count and should be treated as such. Fever alone in the immunocompromised patient is sufficient grounds for admission/observ ation. Differential diagnosis includes pneumonia (PCP, bacterial ), histoplas \u00ad mosis (especially for those living in, or recently traveling to, the Ohio/Mississippi river valley areas), toxoplasmosis (disseminated or encephalit is), Respiratory symptoms. Most standard prognosis/deci\u00ad sion algorithms do not apply to the immunocompromised. Therefore, admission and empiric treatment are appropri\u00ad ate for the HIV-positive patient with low CD4 count and possible pnewnonia. special note, patients with HIV, cough, and fevers are at risk for pulmonary TB. They should be masked and placed in a respiratory isolation room directly from triage. Up to 12% of HIV-infected patients with TB may have a normal chest x-ray. Neurologic symptoms. Neurologic symptoms in the HIV-positive patient, particularly with low CD4 count, should be treated as a medical emergenc y. The evalua\u00ad tion is as above, and empiric treatment, when war\u00ad ranted, should not be delayed. Differential diagnosis includes meningitis, bacte\u00ad drug reactions. Gastrointestinal symptoms. Diarrhea is the most com\u00ad mon gastrointestinal (GI) complaint in the HIV-positive population, and this may be due to many factors, including acute retroviral therapy (ART) or opportunistic infection (OI), in addition to usual causes of diarrhea in the non\u00ad HIV-infected population. Many GI complaints can be managed successfully without requiring admission, although certain diagnoses ( eg, pancreatitis, lactic acidosis) merit close monitoring, usually in an inpatient setting. Differential diagnosis is dependent on the particular GI symptom (s) and includes esophagitis (candida, Figure 37-4 for a diagnostic algorithm for a patient with HIV presenting with fever, respiratory, or neurologic complaints. TREATMENT The treatment and management of HIV itself is rarely an emergenc y. Data have shown that initiation of ART earlier in the course of HIV infection benefits both those with OI (eg, TB), and those without OI. Current Department of Health and Hwnan Services guidelines recommend treat\u00ad ment for all persons diagnosed with HIV. However, given the complexities associated with initiation of an antiretro \u00ad viral regimen, the decision about what to start should be made in conjunction with an expert in the management ofHIV. Fever (Undifferentiated) Well-appearing patients with CD4 counts >500/J.LL without an obvious source of infection do not need specific antimi\u00ad crobial therapy and are treated as an immunocompetent CHAPTER 37 Admission Consider discharge depending on clinical picture LP (cryptococcus, meningitis), consider MRI Antimicrobial therapy if CT/MRI scan or LP positive Likely admission Figure 37-4. Human appear ill and have CD4 counts <200/jlL should be treated with broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage (piperacillin-tazobactam plus arninoglycoside, consider addition of vancomycin when concerned for methicillin\u00ad resistant Staphylococcus aureus as etiologic agent). Pulmonary Complaints Patients with suspected PCP should be treated with trimethoprim-su lfamethoxazo le. If is >35 mmHg, adjunctive steroids should be given (usually a prednisone taper). Because PCP is often indis\u00ad levofloxacin, moxifloxacin) should be added. All patients should be isolated until TB has been ruled out. CNS Complaints Patients with CT /MRI findings consistent with toxoplasmo\u00ad sis and mass effect from the CNS lesion require neurosurgi\u00ad cal consultation and steroids (dexamethasone 10 intravenously [IV]). Cryptococcal meningitis is treated amphotericin B (often with 5-fluorocytosine) after con\u00ad sultation with an infectious disease specialist. Suspected bacterial meningitis should be treated immedia tely (see Chapter 35) and not delayed for imaging or LP. Retinal lesions consistent with possible CMV retinitis should be treated with ganciclovir (IV) in conjunction with consulta\u00ad tion with an ophthalmologist and infectious disease special\u00ad ist. There is currently no effective treatment for PML, although immune reconstitution can help slow or halt pro\u00ad gression of the disease. HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENC Y VIRUS ..... Gl Complaints Suspected candida} esophagitis should be treated with oral fluconazole. Failure to improve suggests drug-resistant Candida, CMY, or herpes as the cause.

HIV risk is 0.3%. Postexposure prophylactic medications Microper forations in gloves can allow contamination of the 162 BLOOD AND BODY FLUID EXPOSURE hands. Infection can also occur when removing gloves. Hence hand washing is recommended after removing gloves. Sharp instrwnents should always be disposed of in proper sharps bins and blood and body fluid contaminated objects in proper biohazard bags. CLINICAL PRESENTATION History An exposure consists of a break in the skin by a sharp object (eg, a needle or scalpel) or contact with mucous mem\u00ad branes or non-intact skin by blood or other body fluids. If a needle is involved, determine whether it was a \"less severe\" (solid bore, superficial scratch) or \"more severe\" (large bore hollow needle, deep puncture, visible blood on the device, or the needle was used in the source patient's artery or vein) exposure. For mucous membrane or percutaneous expo\u00ad sures of non-intact skin, the volwne and duration of exposure should be noted. Determine information about the source individual (unless this is not possible or prohib\u00ad ited), specifically their HBV, HCV, and HIV infectivity. Lastly, docwnent the patient's tetanus status. Physical Examination Examine the patient's skin for any breaks or visible blood. Make sure that the patient has cleaned the area. If not, immedia tely cleanse the area with copious soap and water. Small wounds can be cleaned with an antiseptic such as an alcohol-based hand hygiene agent (alcohol is virucidal to HIY, HBV, and HCV). Mucosal surfaces and eyes should be flushed with saline or water. There is no evidence that squeezing blood out of the wound reduces the risk of transmission. DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES If it is unknown whether the source patient is infected with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or HIV, then the source patient's blood should be tested after obtaining consent. This will require contacting personnel in the location where the patient is located (eg, operating room). In some regions, consent for such testing is not required. All source patients should be tested for HBsAg, HCV, and HIY, unless they are known to be infectious. Obtaining a rapid HIV test of the source patient's blood is valuable in making decisions about whether to start postexposure prophylaxis from the ED. The exposed patient's blood may be collected in the ED or the employee health clinic. Many EDs will have a spe\u00ad cific protocol to follow regarding what laboratory tests should be drawn on the exposed health care worker. For the person exposed to HBV, perform hepatitis surface antigen testing. If this is positive, then the individual has been vaccinated and is a known responder; no further treatment is required. For the person exposed to a HCV-pos itive source, base\u00ad line testing for anti-HCV and alanine aminotransf erase (ALT) actmty is performed, with repeat testing at 4-6 months. If earlier detection is desired, testing for HCV RNA can be performed at 4-6 months. For the person exposed to HIY, HIV-antibody testing should be per\u00ad formed for at least 6 months postexposure (at 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 6 months). Extended HIV follow-up (for 12 months) is recommended for health care professionals who become infected with HCV after exposure to a source co-infected with HIV and HCV. MEDICAL DECISION MAKING The decision to initiate treatment is determined by assess\u00ad ment of the risk of the exposure and the infectivity of the source patient (Figure 38-1). Low-risk injuries are defined by a solid needle, superficial appearance, and a low risk source, such as a patient with an HIV viral load <1,500 copies/mL. High-risk injuries include those involv\u00ad ing a hollow bore needle with presence of visible blood on the device or exposure from a needle that was in an artery or vein of the source patient. TREATMENT In addition to cleaning the wound if it has not already been done, the most important treatment decision for the ED is determining whether or not to give postexposure prophy\u00ad laxis for HIV. Postexposure prophylaxis should be initi\u00ad ated as soon as possible, with the goal being to start treatment within 1-2 hours after exposure. Two nucleosides are recommended for low-risk expo\u00ad sures. Truvada (TDF plus FTC; 1 tablet daily) For higher risk exposures, a boosted protease inhibitor is added: Kaletra (2 tablets twice daily; 200 mg lopinavir/50 mg ritonavir in each tablet) These medications can be difficult to tolerate given their side effect profile (headache, asthenia, and gastroin\u00ad testinal intolerance ). In addition to the dose administered in the ED, the patient will require continued therapy for 1 month. For potential HBV exposures, the health care worker's vaccination status should first be determined. If the exposed person is unvaccinated, treatment with hepatitis B immu\u00ad noglobulin (HBIG) should be started as soon as possible after exposure (preferably within 24 hours). If the exposed person was vaccinated but didn't have an appropriate anti\u00ad body response (HBsAb <10 miU/mL), then proceed as if unvaccinated. If the exposed person has an appropriate antibody response after vaccination, then no treatment is needed, although a booster HBV vaccine can be considered. CHAPTER 38 STEP 1: Determine the exposure code (EC) Is the source material blood, bloody fluid, other potentially infectious material (OPIM) or an instrument contaminated with one of these substances? Large (e.g., several drops, major blood splash and/or longer duration [i.e., several minutes or more)) Less severe (e.g., solid needle, superficial scratch) STEP 2: Determine the HIV status code (HIV SC) Lower titer exposure (e.g., asymptomatic and high CD4 count) STEP 3: Determine the PEP recommendation PEP recommendations PEP may not be warranted. Exposure type does not pose a known risk for HIV transmission. Consider basic regimen. Exposure type poses a negligible risk for HIV transmission. Recommend basic regimen. Most HIV exposures are in this category; no increased risk for HIV transmission has been observed but use of PEP is appropriate. Recommend expanded regimen. Exposure type represents an increased HIV transmission risk. Recommend expanded regimen. Exposure type represents an increased HIV transmission risk. If the source or, in the case of an unknown source, the setting where the exposure occurred suggests a possible risk for HIV exposure and the EC is 2 or 3, consider PEP basic program . ..&.

BLOOD AND BODY FLUID EXPOSURE For potential HCV exposures, baseline testing for anti\u00ad HCV, HCV RNA, and ALT should occur with follow-up testing for HCV RNA between 4 and 6 weeks after expo\u00ad sure and follow-up testing for anti-HCV, HCV RNA, and ALT between 4 and 6 months after exposure. Currently there is no proven effective postexposure prophylaxis treat\u00ad ment available. Immunoglobulins and antiviral agents are not recommended. All patients should be counseled on refraining from unprotected sexual intercourse and blood donations. Follow-up should be given with the institution's employee health departments.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm should be considered in the differential of elderly patients being evaluated for kidney stones. INTRODUCTION Kidney stones occur when urinary solutes precipitate out of the urine and form crystalline stones in the genitourin ary (GU) tract. Nephrolith iasis is common in the United States, with an estimated prevalence of 7% in men and 3% in women. Kidney stones most often affect people in the third to fifth decades of life, but can occur at all ages. The recurrence rate is 30% within the first year and 50% at 5 years. Patients with a family history of kidney stones are more likely to develop stones, and Caucasians are affected twice as often as African Ameri\u00ad cans and Asians. Specific risk factors for kidney stones include dehydra tion, hypercalcemia, hyperuricemia (gout), computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis is the test of choice for diagnosing nephrolithiasis. Urologic consultation is indicated in patients with coexisting infection or worsening renal insufficiency. diuretics, laxatives). The 4 main types of kidney stones are listed in Table 39-1. The GU tract has several anatomic areas of narrowing that may limit passage of a stone. The most common areas are the renal calyx, the ureteropelvic junction (UPJ), the pelvic brim (where the ureter passes over the pelvic bone and iliac vessels), and the ureterovesical junction (UVJ). Ureteral obstruction occurs when a stone blocks the pas\u00ad sage of urine, resulting in hydroureter (dilated ureter) and hydronephrosis (dilated renal pelvis and calices). Timely evaluation, a broad differential, and prompt administration of appropriate analgesia is paramount to proper emergency department (ED) management. Although disposition of these patients is often uncomplicated, certain factors may warrant more extensive workup, emergent urol\u00ad ogy consultation, and hospital admission. Table 39-1. Kidney stones by type, frequency of occurrence, and precipitants. Stone Type Calcium + phosphate/oxalate cause of staghorn calculi) Hyperuricemia Hypercystinuria from genetic disorder 166 NEPHROLITHIASIS CLINICAL PRESENTATION .... History Patients often present with rapid onset of severe sharp pain, which is usually episodic (\"renal colic\") and lasts minutes to hours. Pain often originates in the flank and radiates to the abdomen and groin along the course of the ureter. Nausea, vomiting, and diaphoresis are common. Urinary symptoms, such as frequency and urgency, may vary, depending on where the stone is located, and often increase in severity when the stone nears the bladder . .... Physical Examination Patients with symptomatic nephrolithiasis are often rock\u00ad ing or writhing on the stretcher. They are frequently unable to lie down or find a comfortable position. Elevated blood pressure and heart rate are common because of pain. Examination should focus on identifying and/or ruling out other causes of abdominal and flank pain. It should include a thorough genitourinary evaluation, including pelvic or testicular examination, when pain is located in the lower abdomen. Evidence of a pulsatile abdominal mass or peritonitis suggests an alternative diagnosis. DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES .... Laboratory Although no single laboratory test is needed to diagnose kidney stones, there are several that are critical for manage\u00ad ment and disposition. Urinalysis is performed to assess for hematuria and the presence of concomitant infection. In 15-30% of patients, microscopic hematuria may be absent. Crystals may be present in the urine and aid in the diagnosis of stone type. Urine pH >7.6 (normal is 5.5) may indicate infection with urea-splitting organisms. Urine pregnanc y test should be obtained in all females of childbearing age to rule out the possibility of ectopic preg\u00ad nancy. Blood urea nitrogen and creatinine are often checked to assess renal function, especially in patients at risk for renal insufficiency (diabetics, elderly) or in patients who may receive intravenous (N) contrast. Complete blood count may be helpful when infection is suspected, but is not routinely necessary . .... Imaging Computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis is the test of choice for diagnosis of nephrolithiasis (Figure 39-1). It has a sensitivity and specificity of approx\u00ad imately 96% for kidney stones. CT scans can visualize all 4 types of kidney stones as well as perinephric stranding, hydroureter, and hydronephrosis. They can also identify of pain (eg, abdominal aortic aneu\u00ad cases of diagnostic uncertaint y. Noncontrast CT scan does not evaluate renal function or the presence of complete obstruction. .&. Figure 39-1. CT scan of left ureteral stone (arrow). Renal ultrasound may also be considered as an imaging option, particularly in patients with contraindications to CT scan ( eg, pregnancy) . It is highly sensitive for hydronephrosis, but only moderately sensitive for detecting stones, and provides no information regarding stone size or location. Abdominal plain film radiography is occasionally used to diagnose kidney stones, particularly in patients with a long history of kidney stones and multiple prior imaging studies. It has similar sensitivity to renal ultrasound, with similar limitations . MEDICAL DECISION MAKING Although the clinical presentation of a patient with acute flank pain and suspected kidney stones may seem straight\u00ad forward, particularly in a patient with a history of kidney stones, it is important to consider a broad differential diagnosis and perform a thorough history and physical exam. Immediate life-threatening conditions, such as rup\u00ad tured AAA and aortic dissection, must be considered, par\u00ad ticularly in older, hypertensive patients with no history of kidney st ones. Other diagnoses to consider include biliary colic, pyelonephritis, musculo skeletal back pain, diverticu\u00ad litis, and bowel obstruction. Pay specific attention to the GU exam, as both testicular/ovarian torsion and ectopic pregnancy can present with isolated flank pain and with similar clinical appearance to kidney stones (Figure 39-2). TREATMENT Management of suspected nephrolithiasis includes aggressive pain control, and this intervention should not be delayed pending diagnostic confirmation. Opioid analgesics are the mainstay of treatment for acute symptomatic nephrolithiasis. Nonsteroidal anti-infl ammatory drugs are an excellent adjunct to opiates, but should be avoided in patients with baseline renal impairment, as this class of drugs may worsen renal insufficienc y. Anti emetics are also useful in treating the nausea and vomiting often present in these patients. N fluids are often beneficial in patients with nausea and vomiting; CHAPTER 39 Acute flank pain Focused history & physical exam: rule out immediate life threats and alternate diagnoses IV analgesia Ketorolac 30 mg IV or Morphine 4 mg IV D Oral analgesia Urology follow-up Urine strainer Clear discharge instructions with reasons for return Lab studies: UA, BUN/CR Search for alternate diagnosis .&.

Additional therapeutic intervention includes antibiotics in those patients with coexisting urinary tract infections. DISPOSITION ..... Admission Patients with intractable pain and/or inability to tolerate oral intake after aggressive ED management should be admitted to the hospital. Patients with kidney stones and concomitant urinary tract infection are at high risk for developing urosepsis and require urology consultation for consideration of ureteral stenting or percutaneous neph\u00ad rostomy tubes. Patients with a solitary kidney, history of renal transplant, or renal dysfunction should be discussed with urology and admitted. ..... Discharge Most patients with nephrolithiasis can be successfully managed in the ED and safely discharged. They should have adequate pain control and the ability to tolerate oral NEPHROLITHIASIS intake before discharge. Follow-up is recommended with a primary care provider within 1 week for small ( <6 mm), uncomplica ted kidney stones in patients with a known history of nephrolithiasis. Urology follow-up is recom\u00ad mended for patients with first time stones and large (>6 mrn) proximal stones, as these stones have a low likeli\u00ad hood ( < 1 Oo/o) of spontaneous passage. Patients should be given prescriptions for opioid analgesics and a urine strainer with instructions to strain all urine until stone passage and to bring passed stones to their follow-up appointment. Alpha blockers (tamulosin, terazosin, or doxazosin) are prescribed for up to four weeks to relax ureteral smooth muscles and increase the rate of stone passage and decrease pain. Lastly, patients should be given clear and specific discharge instructions to return to the ED if they have fever, persistent vomiting, intractable pain, or inability to urinate.

Roberts, MD Key Points Differentiate a contaminated urinalysis from urinary tract infection (UTI}. Obtain a catheterized urine specimen when the diagnosis is in question. Send a urine culture only when appropriate (pregnancy, recurrent UTI, pyelonephritis, urosepsis, INTRODUCTION A urinary tract infection (UTI) refers to an infection any\u00ad where in the urinary system in the presence of bacteriuria and symptoms. Cystitis is a lower tract infection of the bladder. Pyelonephritis is an upper tract infection of the kidney. An uncomplicated UTI occurs in patients without comorbidities and with an anatomically and functionally normal urinary tract. Complicated UTI occurs in patients with a functional or anatomic abnormality of their urinary tract or with the presence of serious comorbidities that place the patient at risk for serious adverse outcomes. These comorbidities include pregnancy, diabetes, immu\u00ad nocompromise, cancer, advanced age, and recent hospital\u00ad ization or instrumentation. Anatomic factors that cause obstruction of urine flow resulting in complicated UTI include prostate enlargement, renal stones, obstructing tumors, and ureteral reflux, compression, or stricture. UTI is one of the most common bacterial infections. In 2007, nearly 1.7 million UTis were diagnosed in U.S. emergency departments (EDs), and 12% required hos\u00ad pital admission. Neonates, girls, and young women are at increased risk for infection. UTI is uncommon in young men; however, men older than 55 years have an increased risk due to incomplete bladder emptying from prostatic hypertrophy. UTI is the leading cause of sepsis immunosuppression, fever without a source, indwelling bladder catheter). Treat asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant patients. Be aware of local bacterial resistance patterns when treating UTI. in the elderly and the most common hospital-acquired infection. The bacterial organisms that usually cause UTI are the enteric flora that colonize the perineum. Gram-negative aerobic organisms and Escherichia coli are the most com\u00ad mon, causing more than 80% of infections. Staphylococcus saprophyticus has the ability to adhere to urinary tract tis\u00ad sue, even with normal urinary flow, and causes 10-15% of UTis. Other less common bacteria ative species Klebsiella, Proteus, Serratia, and Pseudomonas. CLINICAL PRESENTATION History The patient history should be used to determine the pres\u00ad ence of UTI, differentiation of upper versus lower tract infection, and the presence of any complicating factors. Uncomplicated cystitis symptoms include urinary fre\u00ad quency, urgency, dysuria, and mild suprapubic pain. Upper tract infection often begins with similar symptoms fol\u00ad lowed by pain extending to the back or abdomen and may have additional symptoms of fever and vomiting. Other important historical information includes pregnancy, 170 URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS recent hospitalization, immunosu ppression, prostatic hypertroph y, urinary stones, and the presence of recent urinary tract instrumentation or bladder catheterizati on. ...... Physical Examination Patients with lower urinary tract infection should be afe\u00ad brile and have normal vital signs. Mild suprapubic tender\u00ad ness may be present. An external genital examination should be performed to assess for extraurethral causes of dysuria. Pyelonephritis is indicated by flank tenderness over one or both kidneys. Fever and tachycardia may be present. The remainder of the examination should be directed at ruling out other diagnoses. A pelvic examina\u00ad tion should be performed to assess for cervicitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, or pregnan cy. In a male, the GU exam may reveal urethritis, epididymitis, or prostatitis. The abdominal examination should assess for possible cholecystitis, appendicitis, diverticulitis, or an abdominal mass that may be causing obstruction to urinary flow. Lung examination may reveal that fever and flank pain are due to a lower lobe pneumonia. DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES ...... Laboratory A urinalysis should be performed on all patients with symp\u00ad toms consistent with UTI. The urine collection method should vary based on patient presentation. A dean-catch midstream specimen is usually adequate. Bladder catheterization should be performed for pediatric patients, the obese, women who are menstruating or have vaginal discharge, and the debilitated. Expected findings on urinalysis are listed in Table 40-1. A urine pregnancy test should be performed on all women of child\u00ad bearing age. Asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy should be treated, as this condition has been linked to prematuri ty, fetal morbidity, and stillbirth. Urine cultures should be sent if complicated UTI is suspected. Complicating factors include pregnanc y, recurrent UTI, pyelonephritis, urosepsis, immuno\u00ad suppression, indwelling bladder catheter, and fever without a source. Table 40-1. Urinalysis interpretation. Urinalysis Results Bacteria WBCs RBCs A complete blood count and renal function tests (blood urea nitrogen/ creatinine) are warranted in patients with sys\u00ad temic symptoms such as pyelonephritis to assess for renal insufficien cy, dehydration, electrolyte derangement, or sepsis, but are not indicated for simple cystitis. Other lab tests (liver function tests, lipase) may help with the differential diagnosis but are not routinely indicated. Blood cultures are obtained if the site of infection is unclear or if the patient has sepsis. ..... Imaging Imaging is indicated when the clinical presentation indi\u00ad cates possible urinary obstruction, extensive disease with abscess, or to diagnose other conditions in the differential. Imaging may also be performed for relapses or recurrent UTis to assess for an unsuspected nidus for infection such as renal stone. Noncontrast computed tomography ( CT) of the abdomen and pelvis is the most common study obtained and readily diagnoses kidney stones and hydrone\u00ad phrosis. Renal ultrasound may be performed to assess for hydronephrosis in patients in whom CT is contraindicated (pregnancy) , but is less sens itive for the presence of stones. MEDICAL DECISION MAKING The differential diagnosis for patients with lower tract UTI includes urethritis, vaginitis, and cervicitis. For patients with systemic symptoms and possible upper tract UTI, the differential includes nephrolithiasis, pneumonia, divertic\u00ad ulitis, appendicitis, cholecystitis, and pelvic inflammatory disease (Figure 40-1). TREATMENT Treatment of UTI is based on the type of infection, simple versus complicated, severity of illness, and local resistance pat\u00ad terns. Ideally, treatment for all complicated UTis should be based on urine culture results; however, these results are not usually available at the time of empiric antibiotic administra\u00ad tion in the ED. Also local and hospital bacterial resistance pat\u00ad terns should be considered when prescribing empiric treatment. Table 40-2 is a general guide to empiric treatment in the ED.

Yancey, MD Key Points Consider the diagnosis of testicular torsion in any male with abdominal pain. Perform a genitourinary (GU) examination on males complaining of abdominal pain, even if they have no GU complaints. This is especially important in adolescent males. INTRODUCTION Testicular torsion is a primary concern in a male with acute scrotal pain and should be considered in all males with abdominal pain. Torsion is due to twisting of the testicle around the spermatic cord. It initially compromises venous outflow, and later arterial blood flow to the testicle, resulting in ischemia and infarction. The longer the torsion persists, the less chance of testicular survival. Hence, time is of the essence in the diagnosis and management of suspected torsion. Peak incidence of testicular torsion occurs in the first year of life, before the testes descend into the scrotum, with a second peak at puberty, when the volume of the testes rapidly increases. It occurs in about 1 in 4,000 males a year. Testicular torsion is 10 times more likely to occur in a male with an undescended testis. The initial effect of torsion is obstruction of venous return. If torsion persists, venous obstruction leads to wors\u00ad ening edema and ultimately to arterial obstruction and ischemia. The amount of venous obstruction is related to the degree of rotation of the testis on the spermatic cord and vascular supply. Incomplete rotation causes a lesser degree of edema and vascular congestion, whereas complete rota\u00ad tion leads to immediate complete obstruction and ischemia. The amount of testicular damage is related to the degree and duration of venous and arterial obstruction. If pain has been present for <6 hours, the testicular salvage rate is 80-100%. When considering testicular torsion as a diagnosis, never allow an imaging study or laboratory test to delay an emergent urologic consultation. When attempting manual detorsion, remember the direction to turn the testicle is like opening a book. CLINICAL PRESENTATION ..... History Abnormal development of the fixation of the tunica vagi\u00ad nalis to the posterior scrotal wall can cause the testicle to hang freely in the scrotum like the clapper of a bell, aligned in a horizontal rather than vertical axis (Figure 41-1). This predisposes the testicle to torse, frequently in the context of strenuous physical activity or scrotal trauma. Torsion can also occur during sleep, when the cremaster muscle con\u00ad tracts. Other risk factors for testicular torsion include incomplete descent of the testes and testicular atrophy. Patients will present with acute onset of unilateral scro\u00ad tal pain. The pain is usually severe and noted in the lower abdomen, the inguinal canal, or the testis. Nausea and vomiting are often associated. Because it is an ischemic vascular event, the pain is not positional initially. Later, with significant testicular and scrotal edema, the pain may become more positional. ..... Physical Examination Examination of the opposite testis may be helpful because anatomic abnormalities are often bilateral. Examine the patient in both the supine and standing positions. When the patient is standing, look for the affected testicle to be aligned in a horizontal (bell-clapper deformity) TESTICULAR Reprinted AB, Thurman RJ, eds. Atlas of Emergency Medicine. 3rd ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, 2010. than vertical axis (normal). The involved testicle will often lie higher in the scrotum than the opposite side. The involved testicle will be firm, swollen, tender, and the scrotmn will usually be edematous. The size of the scrotal mass is an unreliable indicator of the underlying etiology, and the examination may occasiona lly be unremarkable. Prehn sign (relief of pain with elevation and support of the scrotmn ) is more indicative of epididymo-orchitis than testicular torsion; however, this distinction is unreliable. The cremasteric reflex is tested by lightly scratching the inner aspect of the thigh. A positive reflex is elicited when the ipsilateral testicle retracts upward. This reflex may be normally absent in infants and toddlers, however, absence of this reflex is relatively specific for torsion. DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES .... Laboratory Urinalysis will usually be normal. Complete blood count most often reveals an absence of a leukocytosis. .... Imaging Color Doppler ultrasound is the preferred diagnostic study and has a sensitivity of 85-100% and a specificity of 100%. Ultrasound is also helpful for diagnosing other conditions that are part of the differential diagnosis of torsion, such as epididymitis, torsion Nuclear radioisotope scanning has similar sensitivity to ultrasound; however, the specificity of nuclear scans is much lower. In addition, nuclear scans are more tirne\u00ad consmning than ultrasound. MEDICAL DECISION MAKING Testicular torsion is a time-sen sitive condition that can result in loss of the testicle with associated loss of fertility. Therefore, assmne acute testicular pain is torsion until proven otherwise. Perform a focused history and physical examination as soon as possible. If your clinical suspicion for torsion is high, obtain an immediate urology consult and attempt manual detorsion. Factors associated with testicular torsion include abrupt onset of pain, pain for less than 24 hours at the time of presentation, nausea and vomiting, high position of the testis, and abnormal cremasteric reflex. Torsion of a tes\u00ad ticular appendage typically presents as pain that is more localized to one point on the testicle, more gradual in onset, and without nausea and vomiting. These small developmental remnants may be located at various posi\u00ad tions on the testicle and on exam may be palpable as a hard tender nodule, most often at the upper pole of the testicle. Epididymitis may be associated with dysuria, urgency, and pyuria. Ultrasound will show preserved or increased blood flow. A positive Prehn sign is helpful but is not always present. Epididymitis can extend to become epididymo\u00ad orchitis, which is more likely to be associated with signs of systemic illness such as fever, nausea, and vomiting. Isolated orchitis is rare and usually viral in origin. These infectious processes are all more likely to be gradual in onset. An incarcerated inguinal hernia is another diagnostic consideration. However, the patient is likely to have a his\u00ad tory of hernia or scrotal swelling before the episode of incarceration. Similarly, a tumor is usually gradual in onset and is often painless. Direct testicular tramna can precipitate torsion or cause testicular contusion or Ultrasound will demon\u00ad strate rupture and possibly a hematocele. Consider torsion in any patient with testicular tramna who still has pain 1-2 hours after what seems like a relatively minor injury. There is no single feature of the history, physical exami\u00ad nation, or diagnostic studies that is completely reliable in diagnosing or excluding testicular torsion. Because this is a fertility-threatening diagnosis, high clinical suspicion man\u00ad dates immediate urologic consultation (Figure 41-2). If ultrasound is rapidly available, it may be helpful in con\u00ad firming a diagnosis, but should not delay urologic consult. TREATMENT Most testicular torsions occur in the lateral to medial direction. Manual detorsion should be performed by rotat\u00ad ing the affected testis in the lateral direction 1.5 rotations Acute scrotal pain Immediate GU consult Risk factors for testicular torsion Focused GU and abdominal exam Attempt manual detorsion Diagnostic ultrasound Definitive surgical care CHAPTER 41 Figure 41-2. Testicular torsion diagnostic algorithm. (540 degrees). To remember the direction to detorse, think of opening a book (Figure 41-3). The end point of the maneuver is relief of pain. If pain becomes more severe, attempt detorsion in the opposite direction. If manual detorsion is successful (ie, relief of pain), emergent consul\u00ad tation with a urologist is still required. Manual detorsion is a painful procedure. You should warn your patient and consider administering intravenous (IV) narcotics before the procedure. A single dose of IV narcotics is not likely to ameliorate the pain of testicular torsion or remove the clinical end point (ie, relief of pain) of the detorsion maneuver. When manual detorsion is unsuccessful, emergent sur\u00ad gical exploration and detorsion is indicated. Patients usu\u00ad ally require surgical fixation of both the affected and the unaffected testes to avoid future torsion. A B .A. Figure 41-3. Manual detorsion of the testicle.

Prolonged priapism (>6 hours) may result in impotence. Paraphimosis may lead to glans ischemia and necrosis. INTRODUCTION Penile disorders are a relatively uncommon presentation to the emergency department (ED); however, a few of these conditions are truly emergent. The penis is composed of 3 external anatomic parts-the shaft, glans, and foreskin. Penile disorders can be classified according to how these anatomic areas are affected. This chapter focuses on and paraphimosis, and balanoposthitis. a persistent, often times painful, erection in which both sides of the corpus cavernosa are engorged with blood. Priapism is subdivided into 2 classifications based on the source of blood-high flow versus low flow. Most com\u00ad monly, oxygen-deprived, venous blood becomes entrapped priapism, or ischemic priapism. \"High-flow'' priapism, less often seen, a communication or fistula between the caver\u00ad nosal arterial supply and the cavernosa itself. Because of the oxygen-rich arterial supply, this type of priapism is also called priapism. High-flow priapism presents less of a time-sensi tive is often non painful. ..... Phimosis and Paraphimosis Phimosis is the inability to retract the foreskin proximally over the glans. Causes include infection, poor hygiene, Corpus cavernosum aspiration and dorsal slit are used by the emergency physician to prevent the complica\u00ad tions of priapism and paraphimosis, respective ly, until urology consultation is available. and trauma, which lead to scarring and fibrosis of the foreskin and resultant loss of normal movement. This can infrequently lead to urinary retention owing to blockage of the urethral meatus. phimosis ). By age 4, 90% of foreskins are fully retractable. A foreskin that is not fully retractable by the end of puberty is considered pathologic phimosis. Paraphimosis is the inability to return a retracted fore\u00ad skin to its original, anatomic position. Paraphimosis results when the foreskin is not returned to its normal position overlying the glans penis. This commonly occurs as an iatrogenic complication, such as after an exam of the glans or Foley catheter placement in a debilitated patient. The retracted fo reskin acts in a tourniquet manner, restricting venous outflow from the glans penis. This eventually leads to local swelling, inflammatio n, ischemia, and necrosis of the involved tissue, causing a urologic emergen cy. ..... Balanoposthitis Balanoposthitis is a combination of inflammation of the glans penis (balanitis) and inflammation of the foreskin (posthitis). This condition occurs most commonly in uncir\u00ad cumcised males as a result of poor hygiene, local/recurrent irritation, or infection (usually Candida, Gardnerella, or Streptococcus pyogenes species). Balanoposthitis may be the sole presenting symptom of diabetes mellitus. 177 CLINICAL PRESENTATION History CHAPTER 42 Important historical features of priapism include past medical history, duration of symptoms, causative events, and medications. Medical causes of priapism include sickle cell disease or thalassemia (particularly in children) and leukemia or multiple myeloma in the elderly. The duration of priapism is also of significance. Prolonged vena\u00ad occlusive priapism (usually >6 hours) leads to fibrosis of the corporal tissue resulting in impotence. Patients should additionally be questioned about possible trauma to the penis, as high-flow priapism usually results from a trau\u00ad matic fistula between arterial and venous supply. A thor\u00ad ough medication history should also be obtained. Medications implicated in priapism include antipsychotics (trazodone, sildenafil ). Cocaine a common cause of priapism. For phimosis and paraphimosis, patients should be questioned about duration of symptoms, general hygiene, and foreskin care. Duration of symptoms is particularly important for paraphimosis, as arterial compromise can lead to glans ischemia and necrosis. Because of the strong association between diabetes and balanoposthitis, a thorough past medical and family his\u00ad tory should be sought. Additiona lly, symptoms such as fevers, myalgias, and lymphadenopa thy may suggest pos\u00ad sible systemic involvement. Physical Examination For any of the penile disorders, a general exam of all male genitourinary organs (penis, scrotum, testicles, perineum, anus/rectum, and prostate) should be performed. Inspection alone will often lead one to the diagnosis of priapism, para\u00ad phimosis, or balanoposthitis (Figure 42-1). If the penile foreskin is present, check for proper retraction/replace\u00ad ment. Inspect the underlying glans, looking for erythema, warmth, or discharge. Do not mistake paraphimosis with balanoposthitis, as both may present as a painful, edema\u00ad tous foreskin and glans. The key difference is that the fore\u00ad skin is retracted and nonreducible in paraphimosis. DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES Because most penile disorders can be diagnosed by history and physical exam alone, few diagnostic measures are nec\u00ad essary. To help distinguish between high-and low-flow priapism, an arterial blood gas (ABG) of corporal be obtained. Because low-flow priapism is an isch\u00ad emic process, the ABG will show deoxygenated blood. If the ABG resembles a normal, oxygenated sample, the patient likely has high -flow priapism. Bedside ultrasound also has a role in priapism. If arterial flow can be seen using the color Doppler mode, then high-flow priapism is likely present. A complete blood count and reticulocyte Figure 42-1. Paraphimosis. count can be helpful in sickle cell disease or to rule out leukemia. Paraphimosis and phimosis are generally bedside diag\u00ad noses and require no further diagnostic testing. Because of the strong association of diabetes mellitus and balanoposthitis, a bedside glucose test is warranted. For recurrent or difficult to treat infection, a culture may help to better guide treatment. MEDICAL DECISION MAKING Of the penile disorders discussed, low-flow priapism and paraphimosis are the two that require time-sens itive diagnosis and treatment or permanent penile damage may ensue. Urgent urologic consultation should be sought; however, the emergency physician should also be prepared to intervene when a urologist is not immedia tely available. Uncomplicated phimosis and balanoposthitis are gener\u00ad ally treated in the ED with prompt urologic follow-up (Figure 42-2). TREATMENT Treatment of priapism begins with pain control. If low\u00ad flow priapism is suspected, treatment with subcutaneous terbutaline in the deltoid region can be effective. If pria\u00ad pism persists, corporal injection with an alpha-adrenergic agonist, such as phenyle phrine, is performed. If unsuccessful, corporal aspiration and irrigation can be attempted. First, a penile nerve block is performed for anesthesia. A 21-gauge or larger needle is inserted into the cavernosum (lateral sides of the penis), proximal to the PENILE DISORDERS Attempt manual reduction of foreskin; If unsuccessful, perform dorsal slit procedure in consultation with urologist Disposition: Home with urology follow-up if reduction is successful. Emergency urology consult and admission if unable to reduce .A. Figure 42-2. Penile disorders diagnostic algorithm. glans. Blood is then allowed to drain, or if needed, aspi\u00ad rated, typically until detumescence begins. If necessary, aspiration is then followed by irrigation with 10-20 mL of sterile normal saline, with or without an alpha-adrenergic agent such as phenylephrine. For priapism related to sickle cell disease, simple or exchange transfusion may be necessary. Treatment of paraphimosis involves reducing the retracted foreskin. Ice packs or cold water immersion of the penis may be helpful with edema and inflammation. Compression wrapping with elastic bandage around the glans for 5-10 minutes will also help with the swelling. The glans may then be manually \"pushed\" back into the fore\u00ad skin (Figure 42-3). Local injection with lidocaine may help the patient tolerate the compression dressing better, but will also contribute more fluid to the already swollen penis. If manual reduction fails, the dorsal slit procedure can be attempted. A penile block or ring block is first performed for anesthesia. Next, hemostats are placed at the 11 and 1 o'clock positions on the edematous foreskin and clamped down for hemostasis. Scissors or scalpel are then used to cut the paraphimotic ring at the 12 o'clock position, Freely mobile foreskin with associated erythema, excoriation, and discharge Instructions on cleansing, antifungal cream, antibiotics, and steroid cream when indicated Disposition: Home with primary care follow-up.

CHAPTER 42 between the 2 clamped hemostats. Manual reduction of the foreskin over the glans is then achieved. The reduced foreskin is then repaired with sutures, or a circumcision can then be performed by a urologist. Phimosis requires far less emergent treatment because no vascular risk exists. If manual retraction is unable to be performed, topical steroid treatment applied under the foreskin to the tip of the penis for 4-6 weeks can be effec\u00ad tive. If urinary retention develops, a dorsal slit procedure or full circumcision should be performed. The treatment of balanoposthitis consists of regular cleaning of the glans with soap and water, with the foreskin retracted. Topical antifungal cream (nystatin, clotrimazole) should also be used. If bacterial infection is suspected, an oral antibiotic (ie, first-generation cephalosp orin) should be added to the above treatments. DISPOSITION Patients with persistent, ischemic priapism require emer\u00ad gent urologic consultation. If corporal injection, aspira\u00ad tion, and irrigation (performed by either the urologist or ED physician) fail to achieve detumescence, surgery to perform a cavernosal shunt will most often be necessary. If the preceding treatment options are successful, the patient should be watched in the ED for 4-6 hours to ensure symptoms do not return. If an inciting cause was identified, the patient should also be thoroughly educated about future avoidance. The disposition of paraphimosis is much like priapism. Urgent urologic consultation is required for nonreducible paraphimosis. Admission and surgery may be necessary if manual reduction or dorsal slit are unsuccessful. Patients with phimosis, as long as they can urinate, can generally be treated as an outpatient with good patient instructions, education, and urologic follow-up. Most patients with balanoposthitis can also be safely discharged home. Patients with signs of systemic illness or severe comorbid disease may require admission and intra\u00ad venous antibiotics. Patient education is also very important as the best preventative medicine is good personal hygiene. SUGGESTED READINGS Dubin J, Davis JE. Penile emergencies.

Vaginal Bleeding Steven H. Bowman, MD Key Points Obtain a pregnancy test in any woman of childbearing age who presents with vaginal bleeding or abdominal pain. Risk factors are absent in more than 40% of women who have an ectopic pregnancy. INTRODUCTION Menarche, the onset of menstruation, occurs in girls at approximately age 12. Normal menstruation continues until menopause, which occurs on average at age 51. The adult menstrual cycle is 28 days (\u00b17 days), with menstrua\u00ad tion lasting 4-6 days. Normal menstrual blood flow is approximately 30-60 mL; >80 mL of bleeding is consid\u00ad ered abnormal. Dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB) is due to prolonged or excessive estrogen stimulation or inef\u00ad fective progesterone production. Menorrhagia is an increased volume or duration of bleeding that occurs at the typical time of menstruation. Metrorrhagia is bleeding that occurs at irregular intervals outside of the normal menstrual cycle. Menometrorrhagia is irregular bleeding that is also of increased duration or flow. Pregnancy must be excluded in women of child\u00ad bearing age who present with vaginal bleeding. Vaginal bleeding complicates 20% of early pregnancies. When bleeding occurs, 50% of patients will have a spontane\u00ad ous abortion. In the United States, about 2% of all pregnan\u00ad cies are ectopic pregnancies. Mortality in these women is due to shock from intra-abdominal hemorrhage. In postmeno \u00ad pausal women with vaginal bleeding, 10% will be diagnosed with cancer, the majority being endometrial cancer. Ectopic pregnancy is one of the most important causes of vaginal bleeding. Ectopic pregnancy occurs when a 181 Ruptured ectopic pregnancy is a surgical emergenc y requiring prompt intervention and gynecologic consultation. Patients with postmenopausal bleeding should be referred to a gynecologist for endometrial biopsy to exclude malignancy. trophoblast implants at a site outside of the endometrium. In most cases, the ectopic site is within the lateral two thirds of the fallopian tube. Other sites include the medial third of the fallopian tube, cornu (junction of the tube and uterus), ovary, fimbria, cervix, and abdomen (Figure 43-1). Risk factors for ectopic pregnancy include a history of sal\u00ad pingitis, use of an intrauterine device, a prior ectopic preg\u00ad nancy, increased maternal age, use of fertility drugs, and history of tubal ligation. Up to 42% of women with an ectopic pregnancy have no risk factors. CLINICAL PRESENTATION ..... History A detailed history is essential. Determine the onset of bleed\u00ad ing, the date and duration of the last normal menstrual period, the number of previous pregnancies, and the pres\u00ad ence of any prior history of abnormal vaginal bleeding. Pain may or may not be present. If pain is present, determine pain characteristics such as location, quality, and duration. Approximately 10% of patients with ectopic pregnancy will present with bleeding only. Attempt to have the patient quantify the amount of bleeding. Although variable, a tampon or pad absorbs approximately 30 mL of blood. The presence of clotted blood suggests brisk vaginal bleeding. Inquire about previous gynecologic problems and assess the risk factors for ectopic pregnancy. CHAPTER 43 Tubal 95-96% Interstitial and \u00a3. Figure 43-1. Frequency of sites of ectopic pregnancy. Reprinted with permission from Cunningham FG, Leeno KJ, Bloom SL, Hauth JC, WJ/Iwms Obstetrics. 23rd New York: McGraw-Hill, 2010. Symptoms of weakness, lightheadedness, shortness of breath, or syncope suggest anemia from significant blood loss. Determine the presence of other medical conditions (eg, coagulopathies) or medications (eg, anticoagulants) that may exacerbate vaginal bleeding. Physical Examination Note the patient's blood pressure and pulse, specifically to identify hypotension or a resting tachycardia. Look for other signs of anemia such as general, mucosal, or nail bed pallor. Before performing a pelvic examination, perform a focused general examination, including the heart, lungs, abdomen, and flank. Assess the abdomen for the presence of tenderness, masses, guarding, and rebound. Peritoneal signs may suggest infection or intraperitoneal blood. For the pelvic examination, obtain the patient's consent and ensure her privacy during the exam. Explain what you are going to do. Ideally, both male and female examiners should request that a chaperone be present. Perform the exam with the patient in the lithotomy position. First, inspect the external genitalia. Then, using a warmed, lubricated, and appropriately sized vaginal speculum, determine the pres\u00ad ence of blood, blood clots, tissue (products of conception), or discharge in the vaginal vault. Visually inspect the cervix. On bimanual examination, determine whether the cer\u00ad vical os is open or closed. An open os is present when the tip of the examiner's index finger can easily pass through the cervix. Women with a closed internal os should be Table 43-1. Classification of spontaneous abortion. Type Internal Cervical Os Products of Conception Threatened Closed Not passed Inevitable Open Not passed Incomplete usually open Partially passed Complete Closed Completely passed considered to have a closed os, even if the external portion of the os is open. The internal os and the presence of prod\u00ad ucts of conception will allow classification of different types of spontaneous abortions (Table 43-1). Next, estimate the size of the uterus (12 weeks at the symphysis, 20 weeks at the umbilicus ) by palpating the uterine fundus on the abdomen with one hand and palpat\u00ad ing the cervix with the index and middle fingers on the other hand. Assess the cervix, uterus, and adnexa for ten\u00ad derness or masses. Tenderness on pelvic examination is present in more than 80% of patients with a ruptured ectopic pregnancy. DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES Laboratory Urine pregnancy test is 99.4% sensitive for diagnosing pregnancy at the time that a woman \"misses\" her period. VAGINAL BLEEDING It detects the presence of the beta subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin hormone (-hCG) produced by the trophoblast in the patient's urine. A serum -hCG level is also obtained. In a normal pregnancy, -hCG levels double approximately every 2 days, peaking at 100,000 rniU/mL. Higher levels suggest trophoblastic disease. An ectopic pregnanc y can be present at any -hCG level; therefore, the initial -hCG level cannot be used to exclude ectopic pregnanc y. Patients with repeat -hCG levels that decrease by >50% are at low risk for ectopic pregnanc y, whereas those with levels that do not increase >66% are at high risk. A serum hemoglobin is indicated in most patients with vaginal bleeding, but especially those with a resting tachy\u00ad cardia, lightheadedness, or prolonged duration of bleeding (2:3 weeks). Rh status should be obtained in pregnant patients with vaginal bleeding. Imaging In pregnant patients with vaginal bleeding, the presence of an ectopic pregnancy must be excluded with a pelvic ultra\u00ad sound performed by an emergency medicine physician or radiology personnel. Ectopic pregnancy is excluded when an intrauterine pregnancy (IUP) is visualized on pelvic ultrasound. A heterotopic pregnancy (a simultaneous IUP and an ectopic pregnanc y), traditionally considered rare, is more common in women receiving treatment for infertil\u00ad ity. Patients with pelvic ultrasounds that demonstrate a noncystic adnexal mass, moderate-large fluid in the cul\u00ad de-sac, an extrauterine gestational sac, or an empty uterus (with -hCG >1,000 rniU/mL) should be considered high risk for ectopic pregnancy. In 15-20% of patients, the ini\u00ad tial pelvic ultrasound will be indeterminate (no evidence of an IUP or an ectopic pregnanc y). Of these indeterm i\u00ad will be diagnosed with an ectopic pregnanc y. MEDICAL DECISION MAKING In a patient with vaginal bleeding, the most essential infor\u00ad mation to determine is the hemodynamic status and a urine pregnancy test. In the pregnant patient, the most important role of the emergency department is to exclude an ectopic pregnancy (Figure 43-2). In patients with vaginal bleeding during the first trimester of pregnan cy, the diagnostic possibilities include continuation of what will be a normal pregnancy or an abnormal pregnanc y (ie, spontaneous abortion; ectopic pregnancy; trophoblastic disease). In nonpregnant patients, diagnostic possibilities include dysfunctiona l uterine bleeding, uterine fibroids, malig\u00ad nancy (cervical, uterine or vaginal), infection (PID, vaginal infections), trauma (assault, sexual inter\u00ad course), foreign body (IUD, tampon, sexual devices), and coagulopathies (genetic disorders, medical condi\u00ad tions, medications). TREATMENT When shock is present in a young woman with a positive pregnancy test, ruptured ectopic pregnancy is presumed. Initiate resuscitative measures immediately, including oxygen administration, intravenous (IV) fluids, and/or blood transfusion. Perform a bedside ultrasound and obtain gynecology consultation for surgical intervention. A similar work-up is pursued in women with a positive pregnancy test and an acute abdomen (presumed ruptured ectopic pregnancy), even when the initial vital signs are normal. In pregnant patients with vaginal bleeding, always obtain the Rh status. If the woman is Rh-negative (15% of the white populati on), administer RhoGAM 50 meg intra\u00ad muscularly (IM). Complete and threatened abortions require no further treatment. In incomplete abortion, bleeding will continue until all products of conception have passed. Dilatation and curettage may be indicated if the abortion does not complete on its own. Patients with a rup\u00ad tured ectopic pregnancy require surgery. Some patients with unruptured ectopic pregnancy are candidates for nonsurgi\u00ad cal treatment by the gynecologist with use of methotrexate and leucovorin (IV, orally [PO], or IM as a single dose). In patients with vaginal bleeding unrelated to pregnanc y, consider blood transfusion in patients with symptomatic anemia, especially when the hemoglobin is <7 gm/dL. When bleeding is severe in patients with chronic anovulatory bleeding, relief may be obtained with hormona l therapy ( eg, medroxyprogesterone 10 mg PO for 10 days or Ortho-Novum 1/35 1 tablet QID for 5 days). DISPOSITION Admission Patients with hemodynamic instability, peritoneal find\u00ad ings, severe anemia (hemoglobin <7 grn!dL), or a con\u00ad firmed ectopic pregnanc y on ultrasound should be admitted. Pregnant patients with a closed cervical os, no fetal tissue passed, no IUP visualized on ultrasound, and -hCG >1,000 risk of ectopic preg \u00ad nancy; disposition should be made in consultation with a gynecologist. Admission may be warranted. Discharge Discharge patients with mild to moderate vaginal bleeding, who are hemodynamically stable, and in whom ectopic pregnancy has been excluded. Discharge with gynecology follow-up, and a repeat -hCG level in 48 hours is also appropriate for reliable patients with no IUP seen on ultra\u00ad sound when the -hCG is <1,000 miU/mL. This assumes the patient is hemodynamically stable, has no significant abdominal tenderness, and has no other ultrasound find\u00ad ings that suggest an ectopic pregnancy (moderate to large amount of free fluid or a noncystic adnexal mass). In patients with postmenopausal bleeding, refer to a gyne\u00ad cologist for endometrial biopsy.

Vaginal Discharge joanna Wieczorek Davidson, MD Key Points Vaginal discharge is a common presenting complaint in reproductive-age women. Possible diagnoses include vaginitis, cervicitis, or pelvic inflammatory disease (PI D). INTRODUCTION Many women come to the emergency department (ED) with the chief complaint of vaginal discharge. It may be accompanied by other symptoms such as fever, abdominal or pelvic pain, malodor, itching, and dysuria. Vaginal dis\u00ad charge is usually due to vaginitis, cervicitis, or pelvic inflam\u00ad matory disease (PID). Vaginitis is a spectrum of diseases causing vulvovaginal symptoms including burning, irritation, and itching, with or without vaginal discharge. Normal vaginal flora main\u00ad tains the vaginal pH at 3.8-4.5. Changes in the pH or dis\u00ad ruption of the vaginal flora may result in the overgrowth of pathogenic organisms, ultimately resulting in a change in the appearance, consisten cy, or odor of vaginal secretions. Noninfectious causes like atrophy and contact vaginitis are fairly common -particularly in sexually inactive and post\u00ad menopausal women. The most common infectious causes of vaginitis in descending order of frequency include vaginal of nor\u00ad mal vaginal flora-Gardnerella vaginalis. Infections of the upper reproductive tract (cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes, adnexa) will also cause discharge. Cervicitis is the term used when infection is present within the cervix only. Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is a spectrum of upper genital tract infections that includes endometritis, sal\u00ad pingitis, tubo-ovarian abscess, and pelvic peritonitis. Sexually transmitted organisms, especially Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Clinical evaluation for the diagnosis of PID is not sensitive. Maintain a high suspicion and low threshold to treat. Chlamydia trachomatis, are implicated in the majority of cases of both cervicitis and PID; however, other are also causative. PID affects 11% of women of reproductive age and requires hospital admission in 20%. Inflammation and inf ec\u00ad tion can lead to scarring and adhesions within the fallopian tubes, leading to major long-term sequelae including infertil\u00ad ity, ectopic pregnan cy, and chronic pelvic pain. The risk of ectopic pregnancy is 12-15% higher in women who have had PID. Tubal factor infertility is increased 12-50% in women with a past diagnosis of PID. Prevention of complications is dependent on early recognition and effective treatment. CLINICAL PRESENTATION ..... History Any complaint of vaginal discharge or pelvic pain requires a detailed gynecologic history. Inquire about history of sexually transmitted infections (STis), intrauterine device use, pregnancies, last menstrual period, and any previous gynecologic procedure. History should include details of vaginal discharge, odor, irritation, itching, burning, bleed\u00ad ing, dysuria, and dyspareunia. In addition, determine the presence of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fevers, rash, or joint aches. Patients with vaginitis lack significant abdominal pain or fevers and do not appear systemically ill. BV typically 185 CHAPTER 44 presents with thin, whitish gray discharge that has a fishy smell. In candidiasis, pruritus is the most common and specific symptom; discharge tends to be white and occa\u00ad sionally thick and \"cottage-cheese\" like. It is important to ask about risk factors for candida! colonization: uncon\u00ad trolled diabetes mellitus, recent antibiotic and pregnancy . Patients with trichomonas vaginitis (a sexually transmitted protozoan parasite) are asymptomatic in 50% of cases, but the classic discharge is described as yellow, frothy and malodoro us. Vaginal atrophy is present in 60% of women 4 years after menopause. Symptoms of atrophic vaginitis include vaginal dryness, soreness, itching and occasional thin, scant, yellowish discharge. Acute PID can be difficult to diagnose because of the wide variation in symptoms and signs. The most common presenting symptom is lower abdominal pain that tends to be bilateral, dull or crampy. Approximately 75% of patients with PID have abnormal vaginal discharge. Unilateral pain should raise suspicion for a tuba-ovarian abscess or an alternate diagnosis like appendicitis. Dyspareunia may be present as well as urinary tract symptoms. Only one third of patients with PID will have fever >100.4\u00b0 F. Physical Examination Obtain the patient's vital signs, particularly noting blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Before performing a pel\u00ad vic exam, perform a focused general exam, including the abdomen and flank. During the pelvic exam, inspect the external genitalia. Make note of vulvar edema or erythema, which can be a sign of vaginitis. On the speculum exam, determine the presence of blood or discharge in the vaginal vault. Visualize the cervix, looking for inflammation, for\u00ad eign body, and discharge originating from the os. Mucopurulent cervicitis is a common finding in both cer\u00ad vicitis and PID (Figure 44-l). On bimanual exam it is important to note cervical motion tenderness (CMT) as well as adnexal fullness or tenderness. CMT, also referred to as the chandelier sign, is elicited by moving the cervix up and down or laterally with the index and middle finger. This causes movement of the uterus and tubes, which will significantly reproduce pain in patients with PID. CMT is sensitive but lacks specificity, as it can be positive in patients with other sources of inflammation (appendicitis, ruptured cysts, or ectopic pregnanc y). Adnexal tenderness appears to be the most sensitive finding (95%) for PID. DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES Laboratory Any evaluation of a woman of childbearing age in the ED should including a pregnancy test, as the possibility of ectopic pregnancy or septic abortion must be considered. During the pelvic exam, vaginal secretions may be col\u00ad lected and tested. Microscopic examination of vaginal secretions and evaluation of pH are useful diagnostic tools; .A Figure 44-1. Discharge coming from the cervical os. Reprinted with permission from Buckley RG, Knoop KJ. Chapter Thurman RJ, eds. Atlas of Emergency Medicine. 3rd ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, 2010. Photo contributor: Sue Rist, FNP. however, microscopes and reagents are not available in all EDs. A slide for microscopy is prepared by mixing a sample of discharge with 1-2 drops of normal saline and then applying a coverslip. Vaginal secretions may also be prepared with lOo/o potassium hydroxide (KOH), often producing a fishy odor, or positive whiff test, which may provide evidence for a diagnosis (Table 44-l). During the speculum exam, endocervical cultures should be obtained by placing a swab l em into the cervix and rotating it. DNA probe swabs have a high sensitivity and specificity for both gonorrhea and chlamydia; how\u00ad ever, the results of these tests are not immedia tely available in the ED. In patients with abdominal pain or toxic appearance, blood tests may be helpful. An elevated white blood cell (WBC) count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), or C-reactive protein (CRP) can support the diagnosis of PID. Urinalysis should be part of the laboratory evaluation; VAGINAL DISCHARGE Table 44-1. Distinguishing causes of vaginitis. however, a positive urinalysis finding does not exclude PID, as inflammation in the pelvis can produce WBCs in the urine. Testing for other STis such as human immunodefi \u00ad ciency virus, hepatitis, and syphilis may also be warranted.

Complex adnexal masses signifying tubo-ovarian abscesses are seen on ultrasound as well. Abdominopelvic computed tomography (CT) scans can also be used for patients with toxic appearance, pain, and suspicion of tubo-ovarian abscess. CT findings in PID include cervicitis, oophoritis, salpingitis, thickening of uterosacral ligaments, simple or complex pelvic fluid, or abscess collection s. MEDICAL DECISION MAKING In patients presenting with vaginal discharge, use the his\u00ad tory and pelvic exam to determine the cause (Figure 44-2). Patients presenting with vulvovaginal discomfort, without evidence of cervicitis on pelvic exam or concern for STI, can be treated for vaginitis. The cause of vaginitis can be determined based on historical factors as well as composi\u00ad tion of vaginal discharge.

It is important to rule out PID in these patients. Given the difficulty of diagnosis and potential complications, the 2010 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guide\u00ad lines recommend that providers maintain a low threshold to treat PID. Empiric treatment for PID should be initiated in sexually active young women and other women at risk for STis if they are experiencing pelvic or lower abdominal pain, if no other cause of pain can be identified, and if one or more of the following minimum criteria are present on pelvic exam: CMT, adnexal tenderness, or uterine tender\u00ad ness. One or more of the following additional criteria can be used to enhance the specificity and support a diagnosis of PID: oral temperature >101\u00b0F, abnormal cervical or mucopurulent discharge, presence of abundant WBCs on microscopy of vaginal fluid, elevated ESR, elevated CRP, or laboratory documentation of cervical infection with N. gonorrhoeae or C. trachomatis. TREATMENT The treatment of vaginitis, cervicitis, and PID is outlined in Tables 44-1, 44-2, and 44-3. All regimens used to treat cervicitis and PID should be effective against N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis. The need to treat anaerobes has not been completely studied. Gardnerella (BV) has been present in many patients with PID, so many recommend treatment regimens that include anaerobic coverage (ie, metronidazo le). For women with mild to moderate sever\u00ad ity PID, parenteral and oral regimens appear to have similar efficacy. DISPOSITION ....

Wittels, MD Key Points Gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, and eclampsia represent a spectrum of potentially life-threatening diseases that must be diagnosed and treated aggressively. Consider preeclampsia in any pregnant patient with an elevated blood pressure. INTRODUCTION Hypertension in pregnancy occurs in approximately 10% of pregnancies and can be associated with significant maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. The spectrum of disease is divided into 3 main categories: gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, and eclampsia. Preeclampsia affects 2-6% of pregnancies in the United States, with a higher incidence globally. Eclampsia occurs in <1% of patients with preeclampsia. Gestational hypertension is defined as a blood pressure > 140/90 mmHg in a pregnant patient without preexisting hypertension. The hypertension will resolve within 12 weeks postpartum. When proteinuria is also present, it is defined as preeclampsia. Preeclampsia typically occurs after 20 weeks' gestation. A subset of patients will develop severe preeclampsia, which is associated with one of more of the following: severe hypertension (> 160/110 mmHg on 2 separate occasions >6 hours apart), large proteinuria, neurologic symptoms, epigastric/right upper pain, thrombocytopenia. Eclampsia is preeclampsia with seizures. HELLP syndrome affects some patients with preeclampsia and eclampsia and is associated with hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets. Although the exact etiology of preeclampsia is unknown, there are several factors that are thought to contribute. The degree of hypertension does not correlate with the severity of preeclampsia. Delivery of the fetus is the definitive treatment of preeclampsia and eclampsia. These include maternal immunologic intolerance, abnormal placental implantation, endothelial dysfunction, and genetic factors. CLINICAL PRESENTATION ..... History Patients with gestational hypertension and preeclampsia may be asymptomatic. Some women will report facial or extremity edema, epigastric or RUQ pain, headache, or visual distur\u00ad Seizures in a woman with preeclampsia is pathogno\u00ad monic for eclampsia and may occur in the postpartum period. Risk factors for preeclampsia that should be screened for during the history include nulliparity, advanced maternal age, a multiple gestation pregnancy, diabetes, obesity, and previous preeclampsia. ..... Physical Examination It is critical to pay careful attention to the vital signs, particularly the blood pressure. Edema of the face or extremities may be appreciated. Examination of the lungs may reveal rales suggestive of pulmonary edema. The abdominal exam is important to assess for tenderness as well as to estimate the gestational age of the fetus (Figure 45-1). Listen for fetal heart tones with a Doppler or 189 ------- 30 --24' 20 .r---... 16 \"12' 45 Figure 45-1. Measurement from symphysis pubis to fundal height as a clinical estimator of gestational age. measure the fetal heart rate with bedside ultrasound. A complete neurologic examination is performed to identify any new deficits. DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES Laboratory A urinalysis is indicated to identify proteinuria or infection. A 24-hour urine collection with >300 mg protein is significant and corresponds approximately to 2:1 +protein on the dipstick (although the dipstick is thought to be an unreliable measure ). Additional testing includes electrolytes, renal function, and liver function tests. With HELLP syndrome, the complete blood count will reveal thrombo\u00ad cytopenia, and the peripheral smear may also show schisto\u00ad cytes. Lactate dehydrogenase will be elevated if hemolysis is present. A magnesium level should be ordered as a base\u00ad line for potential magnesium therapy. In addition, a type and cross should be sent in preparation for possible fetal delivery. Imaging A noncontrast head computed tomography should be obtained in any patient with a new onset seizure to differentiate an intracerebral hemorrhage or mass from eclampsia as the etiology of the seizure. Ultrasonography is recommended to assess the status of the fetus. Continuous monitoring will alert providers to signs of fetal distress. MEDICAL DECISION MAKING In a pregnant patient with hypertension, the presence of proteinuria is enough to make a diagnosis of preeclampsia (Figure 45-2). Before confirmation of proteinuria, other diagnoses should be considered. If abdominal pain is present, the differential diagnosis includes pancreatitis, hepatitis, cho\u00ad lecystitis, or gastritis. Headache and neurologic deficits may be due to an intracerebral hemorrhage or stroke. Laboratory studies will help identify patients with HELLP syndrome. Pregnant female (usually > 20 weeks) BP > 140/90 mmHg + proteinuria Ask about symptoms of headache , abdominal pain, visual disturbances, or edema HELLP syndrome .&. Figure 45-2. BP, blood pressure; HELLP, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets. PREECLAMPSIA AND ECLAMPSIA TREATMENT Initial treatment is focused on stabilizing the patient. Place the woman in the left lateral decubitus position to improve circulation. Apply supplemental oxygen, cardiac monitor\u00ad ing, and establish intravenous (IV) access. Avoid over hydra\u00ad tion, as it may result in pulmonary edema. Antihypertensive therapy is indicated in the setting of severe hypertension (systolic blood pressure 160 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure 11 0 mmHg). Appropriate agents include hydrala\u00ad zine, labetalol, nifedipine, or nitroprusside. It is important to avoid being overly aggressive with antihypertensive agents, as a drastic drop in blood pressure can result in fetal hypoperfusion. Magnesium remains the drug of choice for the treat\u00ad ment of severe preeclampsia and eclampsia. In the setting of severe preeclampsia, its primary role is prophylaxis against eclampsia, although it may also have antihypert en\u00ad sive effects. The initial loading dose is 4-6 g IV infused over 15 minutes, followed by 1-2 g/hr. Signs of magnesium toxicity include loss of deep tendon reflexes (8-12 mg/dL), respiratory paralysis (12-18 mg/dL), and cardiac arrest (24-30 mg/dL). Calcium gluconate should be given to counteract cardiorespiratory compromise owing to mag\u00ad nesium toxicity. Phenytoin is an alternate antiepileptic treatment, but is less effective than magnesium. The definitive treatment of preeclampsia and eclampsia is delivery of the fetus. Determining the appropriate timing for this is challenging depending on the fetal age. After 37 weeks, most women with preeclampsia will be induced. In women with severe preeclampsia, delivery should be considered after 34 weeks or in the setting of worsening symptoms regardless of fetal age. If the fetus is less than 34 weeks, steroids (betametha sone) are indicated to improve fetal lung maturity. DISPOSITION Admission Patients with severe preeclampsia should be admitted to the hospital for management of their symptoms and deter\u00ad mination of the ideal time for delivery. Patients with eclampsia require intensive care unit admission. Discharge Patients with gestational hypertension or mild preeclampsia may be managed as outpatients with close obstetric follow\u00ad up. Any signs of worsening preeclampsia should result in admission. Women who are not able to easily access medical care are not good candidates for outpatient management.

Emergency Delivery jessica Sime, MD Key Points Assemble sufficient staff and supplies to care for both the mother and newborn. When vaginal bleeding is present, defer the pelvic examination until placenta previa has been excluded. INTRODUCTION Less than 1% of all deliveries are in the emergency department (ED) because most women in labor are quickly triaged to the labor and delivery unit. However, if a woman is going to precipitously deliver, or the hospital has no obstetric services, it is up to the emergency physician to be prepared to deliver the infant. Moreover, deliveries in the ED are more likely to be considered high risk. Women who deliver in the ED more often have had little or no prenatal care, may have substance abuse problems, do not know they are pregnant, or have been victims of domestic violence. These women may have higher frequencies of complications such as premature rupture of membranes (PROM), preterm labor, postpartum hemorrhage. The emergency medicine physician must be prepared to manage these complications. CLINICAL PRESENTATION History Past medical, surgical, gestational age, and obstetric history should be obtained, as well as history of prenatal care. It is important to inquire about vaginal bleeding during labor. Scant, mucoid bleeding is usually termed bloody show and Utilize bedside ultrasound to check fetal presentation. Be prepared for complications such as postpar\u00ad tum hem orrhage, shoulder dystocia, and breech presentat ion. occurs when the cervical mucus plug is expelled. Heavy vaginal bleeding is a worrisome sign and can represent placenta previa (painless vaginal bleeding from the pla\u00ad centa covering the cervical os) or abruptio placentae (pain\u00ad ful bleeding owing to placental separation from the uterus). The physician should also determine whether the patient has had a spontaneous rupture of membranes (SROM). Clear, blood-tinged, or meconium- stained vaginal fluid suggests rupture of membran es. Physical Examination As always, vital signs are the first step in examination. Fetal heart rate can be assessed with handheld Doppler or with electronic fetal monitoring, if available. The abdomen should be palpated for tenderness and fundal height. Gestational age can be estimated if the mother is unsure. At 20 weeks' gestation, the uterus is at the umbi\u00ad licus, and it grows approximately 1 em every week until 36 weeks. Pelvic examination should begin with inspection of the perineum to determine whether the delivery is immi\u00ad nent (crowning). If the patient reports vaginal bleeding, examination should be deferred until an ultrasound can be performed. It is important to identify placenta previa first, as the bimanual and speculum examination can exacerbate the bleeding. 192 EMERGENC Y DELIVERY The bimanual examination determines the position of the fetus and readiness of the cervix. Sterile gloves should be used to prevent inf ection. A normal cervix is thick, only open at the entry to fingertip, and is firm to touch. Gradually the cervix thins; this is termed effacement. Dilation of the cervix progresses from closed to fully open (10 em). Station indicates the location of the presenting part relative to the ischial spines. A presenting part at the ischial spines is at 0 station. If the presenting part is at the introitus, it is at+ 3 station. Position describes the relation\u00ad ship of the presenting part to the birth canal. Usually the fetal occiput is anterior. Speculum examination can help identify spontaneous rupture of membranes. Pooling vaginal secretions should be tested with Nitrazine paper to determine pH. A dark blue color correlates to a pH of 7.0-7.4 and indicates the presence of amniotic fluid. Normal vaginal secretions have a pH of 4.5-5.5. Next, the cervical os is inspected. The examiner should identify whether it is open slightly, has bulging membranes, a visible fetal head, or other present\u00ad ing part. If the examiner sees a prolapsed umbilical cord, he or she should keep a hand in the vagina and elevate the presenting part to prevent cord compres sion, while an assistant contacts obstetric services for an emergency cesarean section. DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES Laboratory If a patient is about to deliver, no laboratory studies are necessary. A complete blood count, type and screen, prothrombin time/partial thromboplastin time are useful in the event of postpartum hemorrhage. Rh type should be sent to determine the need for RhoGAM. Imaging Bedside ultrasound is used to determine the fetal position, heart rate, and location of the placenta. MEDICAL DECISION MAKING Delivery of a fetus is best done by obstetricians in a labor and delivery unit. If time allows, the emergency physician should attempt to transfer the patient to an appropriate setting. In a hospital with no obstetric services, a precipi\u00ad tously delivering mother must be delivered by the emer\u00ad gency physician. If delivery is not imminent, the patient may be transferred. If a patient needs to be transferred to another hospital, she should be sent by an advanced life support-equipped ambulance, as a patient in labor is con\u00ad sidered medically unstable (Figure 46-1). Gravid female with contractions Prepare for emergenc y delivery Partially dilated and Obstetrician in the hospital .AFigure 46-1. Emergency delivery diagnostic algorithm. CHAPTER 46 TREATMENT If the decision is made to deliver the child in the ED, call for obstetric and pediatric support if available. Large-bore intravenous (IV) access should be obtained and fluids started. Oxygen by nasal cannula is given to the mother, especially if there are any signs of fetal distress. The infant radiant warmer should be set up and in the room. Delivery equipment should be set up including cord clamps, scissors, suction, forceps, and neonatal resuscitation equipment. The mother is placed in the dorsal lithotomy position, and the perineum is cleaned with povidone-iodine solu\u00ad tion. Time permitting, the physician should be dressed in gown, sterile gloves, hat, and mask. When the mother is fully dilated, and the head is at + 3 station, the examiner uses a towel and supports the perineum by gently putting pressure on the fetal chin. The other hand is used to con\u00ad trol the fetal occiput (Figure 46-2A). Slight pressure on the occiput ensures a smooth delivery of the fetal head and reduces tearing. Once the fetal head is delivered, the physician should suction the nose and mouth and check for a nuchal cord. The mother should stop pushing at this point. If a nuchal cord is present, it is pulled over the fetal head. If unable to pull the cord over, it should be clamped in two places and cut in the middle. Next, the anterior shoulder is delivered by guiding the head inferiorly with gentle traction. The posterior shoulder is delivered next by traction upwards. This will also deliver the rest of the infant (Figures 46-2B and 46-2C). If the shoulders are not easily delivered, the physician should consider shoulder dystocia as a complication. Once the infant is delivered, the cord is clamped in 2 locations and cut in the middle. The infant is wrapped, cleaned, and taken to the infant warmer for evaluation. Ideally, a second physician or experienced practitioner can care for the newborn while the delivering physician Figure 46-2. A. Delivery of the head while putting pressure over the perineum. B.

EMERGENCY DELIVERY Table 46-1. APGAR scoring. Sign 0 Points Activity Absent Pulse Absent Grimace No response Appearance Blue-gray or pale Respiration Absent treats the mother. The newborn should be warmed, given oxygen, and stimulated. The APGAR is performed at 1 and 5 minutes (Table 46-1). Neonatal intubation should be considered for poor tone, shallow respirations, and cyano\u00ad sis. Once the infant is assessed, attention is directed back to the mother, to deliver the placenta. The placenta should deliver spontaneo usly, but it can be assisted with uterine massage while pulling gently on the umbilical cord. Pulling too forcefully can result in uterine inversion. Complications of delivery include postpartum hemor\u00ad rhage, shoulder dystocia, and breech presentations. Although rare, these complications generally require the assistance of an obstetrician. Postpartum hemorrhage can occur immediately after delivery or up to a few hours after delivery. The physician should check for retained products, uterine atony, uterine inversion, or vaginal lacerations that are contributing to the blood loss. In the case of uterine atony, oxytocin can be given, 20 units in 1 L of Lactated Ringer's solution. Addition ally, misoprostol 1 mg can be given per rectum. Shoulder dystocia is present when the fetus's anterior shoulder becomes caught under the mother's pubic bone. It is more common in diabetic mothers, obesity, and post\u00ad maturity of the fetus. The first clue to the physician that shoulder dystocia is occurring is a retraction of the fetal head toward the vagina immedia tely after it is delivered. This is called the \"turtle sign.\" In the event of a shoulder dystocia, the legs are flexed ). This rotates the pubic bone over the anterior fetal shoulder. Second, an assistant pro\u00ad vides firm suprapubic pressure to further disengage the 1 Point Arms and legs flexed <100 bpm Grimace Normal, except extremities Slow, irregular 2 Point Active movement > 100 bpm Sneeze, cough, pulls away Normal over entire body Good, crying anterior shoulder. If this does not resolve the dystocia, an episiotomy should be performed to enlarge the opening and provide access to the posterior shoulder. Breech presentations are ideally delivered by cesarean section. Rapid bedside ultrasound can determine whether the fetal head or another part is presenting. Breech presen \u00ad tations can be frank breech (legs are at the fetal face with the buttocks presenting), complete breech (the buttocks are presenting, but the fetal hips and knees are flexed), or incomplete or footling breech (one leg is the presenting part). Breech presentation is dangerous because the but\u00ad tocks and legs do not fully dilate the cervix. The fetal head can become caught in the birth canal during delivery. Likewise, the cervical opening is not completely occluded by the buttocks, so cord prolapse can occur. DISPOSITION All mothers should be admitted to a postpartum unit, and the infant should be admitted to a neonatal nursery. SUGGESTED READING Lazebnik N, Lazebnik RS.

Wade, MD Key Points Inherent differences exist between pediatric and adult patients. Physicians have to treat both the parent and the child. INTRODUCTION Infants, children, and adolescents constitute approximately a third of all visits to emergency departments (EDs) in the United States. Of these pediatric visits, more than half are for urgent/nonemergent problems such as otitis media, respiratory and gastrointestinal infections (often viral), asthma, fractures, sprains, soft tissue trauma, and minor head trauma. The challenge of pediatric emergenc y medicine is to prevent mortality or increased morbidity by catching the few cases that need hospital admission or emergent intervention and ensuring proper discharge of less ill patients. Children are considered minors up to their 18th birth\u00ad day. Although no consent is needed for life-saving inter\u00ad ventions, minors require their parent's or guardian's consent for routine medical care and discharge. An excep\u00ad tion to this rule is the emancipated minor. \"Emancipated minor\" status allows a person less than 18 years of age to consent for medical care without parental knowledge, con\u00ad sent, or liability. The exact legal terms of what makes a minor \"emancipated\" varies slightly from state to state, but generally includes one or more of the following: marriage (including becoming divorced, separated, or widowed), membership in the armed forces, becoming pregnant or having children, living separately from parent(s) or guardian (s), or, finally, demonstrating the ability to man\u00ad age one's own financial affairs. Of the preceding criteria, discovering a patient is pregnant is the most common The older the child, the more reliable the clinical impression. Disposition can be affected by unique family situations. situation the authors' have encountered that leads to emancipated minor status. Another important legal issue for clinicians working with children is our role as mandated reporters. We have a duty to protect vulnerable young patients. If there is reasonable cause to suspect that a child has been abused, neglected, or placed in imminent risk of serious harm, we are obligated to involve government agents such as child protective services, police, etc. There are many aspects of clinical pediatric emergency medicine that differ from adult emergency medicine practice. Not only must you vary your approach to each patient based on their anatomic, physiologic, and developmental status, you also have to establish an effec\u00ad tive relationship with the patient and his or her caregiver. In other words, physicians have to treat both the parent and the child. We review some of these differences later in this chapter. CLINICAL PRESENTATION ..... History Obtain as much information as possible from the child. Questions should be direct and stated in terms the child can understand. Further details and clarifications should be sought from the parents, guardians, or caregivers. The younger the child, the greater reliance on history obtained from the parents, and the more the history may be 196 THE PEDIATRIC PATIENT Table 47-1. Average quantity of feedings based on age. Age 1-2 weeks 3 weeks-2 months 2-3 months 3-4 months 5-12 Volume/Feeding oz 4-5 oz 5-6 oz 6-7 oz 7-8 oz influenced by the parent(s)' perception of symptoms. When taking the history, children can become anxious when separated from parents. Separate children from parents only when absolutely necessary ( eg, in the case of an adolescent patient when a sexual and/or illicit drug history needs to be obtained) or in a younger patient when abuse or neglect is suspected. Unusual complaints such as weight loss, night sweats, headaches, or back pain in a small child should prompt concern for more indolent or life-threatening underlying pathology, particula rly malignanc y. Important historical information needed in all pediatric patients includes birth history, immunizations, prior medical problems, medications, allergies, develop\u00ad mental milestones, usual activity, and oral intake. In par\u00ad ticular, abnormal birth histories and immunization records can have a significant impact on the differential diagnosis for pediatric patients. Normal oral intake for an infant depends on their age (Table 47-1). Any changes from baseline are important to discover and address. Solids are not generally initiated until the infant is approximately 6 months of age. When dehy\u00ad dration is a concern, you should ask about the patient's activity level, oral intake, number of wet diapers, frequency of diarrhea or vomiting, and their ability to make tears. Finally, a mismatch between the history and physical exam or an injury not explained by the historical mecha\u00ad nism provided should prompt the clinician to consider abuse as a cause of the patient's complaint(s). ..... Physical Examination Once the history is obtained, it is time to proceed to a physical examination of the child. Because many children are nervous and afraid of strangers, especially in the unfa\u00ad miliar setting of an ED, a calm, gentle approach to the child during the examination can help a great deal. Having the parent hold the child on his or her lap or hug the child against his or her chest can help to both reassure the child and immobilize him or her during the exam. If the child does start to cry, repeated examinations may be necessary to ensure a thorough and accurate assessment. As in adult emergency medicine, we use the ABCDE (airway, breathing, circulation, disability, and exposure) approach to management with a quick general assessment. Initial assessment includes obtaining the patient's vital signs, Table 47-2. Normal vital signs in pediatric patients based on age. RR Average HR Systolic BP Age which will help guide your management. Normal vital signs vary significantly according to patient age (Table 47-2). For example, the normal pulse in a 6-month-old is about 110 bpm, but this rate would be considered highly abnormal in an adolescent. You should also get an accurate weight on your pediatric patient, as your treatment and medical deci\u00ad sion making will often be based on this weight. As mentioned previously, children have developmental and anatomical differences that must be taken into account during your examination. The pediatric airway poses some unique challenges as compared with adult patients. The larynx is more cephalad and anterior, the tongue is proportiona lly larger, and the epiglottis is tilted and more collapsible, all of which make visualization potentially harder. In terms of endotracheal tube selection, the narrowest portion of the pediatric airway is at the level of the cricoid cartilage, which traditionally meant that a cuffed tube was unnecessary in patients younger than 8 years. This traditional view is becoming less stringent, however, and many hospitals now use cuffed endotracheal tubes in all ages (decreasing air leak and improving venti\u00ad lation efficiency) . The pediatric skeleton and surrounding ligaments and tissues are also more flexible and less protective than the adult. The pediatric head is proportiona tely larger than in adults, increasing the relative force of head and neck inju\u00ad ries. In addition, greater white matter content in the brain increases the risk of injury secondary to axonal shearing and cerebral edema. Infants also have open fontanelles in their skull until about 18 months of age. Older children have open growth plates in their long bones for many years until they close in late adolescence; these are the weakest portions of the bone and the most prone to injury. Injury to the growth plates is commonly classified by the Salter-Harris scoring system (Figure 47-1). Tenderness at the growth plate without evidence of fracture is indicative of a Salter-Harris type 1 fracture and generally should be splinted for patient comfort, improved healing, and medicolegal protection for the physician. CHAPTER 47 Normal Type I Type II Type Ill Type IV Type V .A Figure 47\u00b71. Salter-Harris classification. Reprinted with permission from Simon RR, Sherman sc, and Koenigsknecht SJ. Emergency Orthope dics: The Extremities . 5th ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, 2007. Infants and children are at increased risk of hypothermia because of their high surface area to volume ratio. Pediatric patients are at risk for spinal cord injury without radiographic abnormalities (SCIWORA), because the horizontal alignment of vertebral facet joints and more elastic intervertebral ligaments predispose to subluxation without bony injury. Finally, children overall are at an increased risk for injury or disease because they are unable to communicate, are dependent on their parent(s) or guardian (s), and (especially when very young) are immunologica lly immature. Take seriously a parent's report of a significant change in behavior of his or her child. DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES ..... Laboratory Laboratory testing in children is performed much less frequently than in adult patients. There are few instances in which laboratory testing is part of the standard of care in treating pediatric patients in the ED. These instances include febrile neonates, diabetic ketoacidosis, sickle cell crises, altered mental status, and neutropenic patients with fever. Laboratory testing, generally, should be reserved for confirming a diagnosis that is already suspected clinically, or for assisting in the final disposition of the patient. .... Imaging In certain cases ( eg, trauma, altered mental status, and suspected intraabdominal patholog y), imaging tests such as radiographs, ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be necessary. Plain radiographs are usually well-tolerated by pediatric patients, as they are performed very fast and parents can be close by with lead shielding. CT scans are somewhat less tolerated, especially in younger children, as the patient is required to leave his or her parent and lie flat on a hard surface. This is even more pronounced in MRis for these same reasons, in addition to the anxiety caused by claustrophobia and loud noises made by the MRI. Anxiety with imaging is often treated with short-acting sedatives and/or pain medications (eg, midazolam, chloral hydrate, and/or fentanyl). THE PEDIATRIC PATIENT Pediatric patient presents to ED History obtained from child and parents Examination performed with attention to patient's developmental stage Develop a differential diagnosis with consideration given to age of patient Discuss plan with parents and child Figure 47-2. The pediatric patient diagnostic algorithm. PROCEDU RES The general approach to procedures in children, just as in the physical exam, is less anxiety-provoking by having the parent participate as much as possible. Discussing the procedure ahead of time with the parent(s)-especially taking the time to mention key points during the procedure and important actions the parents can take to help make the procedure more comfortable for their child-can be very helpful. For example, tell parents to hold the child close, talk to the child, and help keep him or her still while using sutures to repair a laceration, and tell parents how doing so will help the child have a better experience (and cosmetic outcome). When performing a procedure, attempts should be made to minimize pain and suffering in children through the use of anesthetic, sedative, and/or pain medications. Not only will the patient be happier, but the parents will be more satisfied with their child's care. Use of topical anesthetics during laceration repair, suprapubic bladder tap, lumbar puncture, or intravenous access is recom\u00ad mended. During complex laceration repair or fracture reduction, consider using procedural sedation. These pro\u00ad tocols use stronger medications such as ketarnine, mid\u00ad azolam, morphine, or fentanyl. Adequate pain relief can help reduce anxiety as well. MEDICAL DECISION MAKING In most pediatric cases, your history and physical exam are sufficient to rule out serious pathology. However, if more ominous diagnoses are suggested by the history and/ or physical, testing should move into laboratory , imaging, and possibly procedures as necessary (Figure 47-2). TREATMENT Once treatment strategies are chosen or narrowed down to a few alternatives, it is a good time to review the options or plan with the parent(s). The parents can be very helpful in supporting the clinician in explaining the plan to the patient. If multiple alternatives are presented, the parents can help choose an option most in line with their wishes, preferences, and/or child's comfort. Medication dosages and emergency equipment must be appropriate for the patient's weight. Getting an accurate weight as part of the initial vital signs can help speed medication calculations at this stage of the ED visit. If a directly measured weight is unavailable in an emergent situation, using a resuscitation tape (previously called Broselow tape) can be extremely helpful. The red arrow on the tape is placed at the patient's head and the tape is extended to his/her feet to measure length. There is an CHAPTER 47 average weight listed on the tape for this length. It is this weight that is used for medication dosing, etc. All medication dosages must be calculated on a milligram per kilogram basis. All treatment should be performed as quickly and as gently as possible. DISPOSITION Admission Indications for admission in pediatric patients include suspected or confirmed acute surgical diagnoses ( eg, appendicitis ), any medical condition requiring further monitoring and treatment ( eg, asthma, dehydration with intractable vomiting ), and uncertain diagnoses requiring further work-up. Also, patients with certain social issues, including suspected abuse, neglect, and failure to thrive, should be considered for admission pending social services consultation. Discharge Stable patients with good social supports and medical follow-up are appropriate for discharge after medical conditions have been diagnosed and treatment plans initiated and/or completed. Chronic conditions and related complex work-ups in otherwise stable patients can be com\u00ad pleted by the patient's primary care provider. Because almost all pediatric patients have regular primary care providers, patients will benefit from contact between the emergency medicine physician and the primary care provider to have appropriate continuity of care after discharge from the ED. The treatment of the pediatric patient presents unique challenges and requires specialized training but is easily achievable by maintaining good rapport and communica \u00ad tion and showing patience and empathy. These skills will decrease the amount of anxiety for the patient and parent, facilitate care, and improve compliance.

Pediatric Fever Shannon E. Staley, MD Alisa A. McQueen, MD Key Points Regardless of age, all toxic-appearing infants and children with fever require a full septic work-up, urgent treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics, and admission. Initial management of fever in infants less than 30 days old includes a complete examination of cerebrospinal fluid, blood, and urine for a serious bacterial infection, prompt empiric antibiotic administration, and hospitalization. INTRODUCTION Fever in children is defined as a rectal temperature ;?:38.0\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F) and accounts for approximately 20% of all pedi\u00ad atric visits to the emergency department (ED). Fever is part of a larger, comprehensive host response to infect ion. Leukocytes and other phagocytic cells release pyrogens, which trigger an increase in prostaglandin synthesis, resulting in an elevation of the thermoregulatory set point. Fever occurs when the hypothalamus responds to this new set point by initiating physiologic ch anges involving endo\u00ad crine, metabolic, autonomic, and behavioral processes. Specific physiologic changes associated with fever such as increased oxygen consumpt ion, protein breakdown, and gluconeogenesis can quickly deplete the already limited reserves of infants and children. Fever can be the first and only physiologic sign of illness. It can herald a serious bacterial infection (SBI) such as meningitis, bacteremia, osteomyelitis, septic arthri\u00ad tis, urinary tract infection (UTI), or pneumonia. These and other SBis can rapidly lead to sepsis, an overwhelming and devastating systemic syndrome caused by infection. A child or infant with a SBI may appear \"toxic\" (very ill-appearing with unstable vital signs). Alternat ively, well-appearing febrile children can also have an SBI Management of well-appearing febrile infants aged 1-3 months is determined by analyzing risk factors for serious bacterial infection. Well-appearing, low-risk, febrile infants and children who do not have a source of infection must have reli\u00ad able follow-up when discharged from the emergency department. such as occult bacteremia. Occult bacteremia is the presence of pathogenic bacteria in the blood of well-appearing, febrile children without any identifiable focus of infection, also described as \"fever without a source:' Approximately 20% of all children presenting with fever will have no identifiable cause. Neonates ( <30 days old) have immature immune systems that place them at high risk for SBI with fever. CLINICAL PRESENTATION History Elicit the duration, pattern, and maximum recorded tem\u00ad perature from caregivers. Young infants do not usually have localizing symptoms and often present with nonspe\u00ad cific complaints such as excessive crying, poor feeding, irritability, or lethargy. Parents of older children may report more specific complaints such as cough, rhinorrhea, sore throat, vomiting, diarrhea, dysuria, joint pain, body aches, or headache. Questions regarding oral intake and urine output will help the clinician assess the degree of associated dehydration, if present. The presence of a seizure in a febrile infant may sug\u00ad gest a benign simple febrile seizure or could be an indicator of meningitis. A simple febrile seizure is defined 201 CHAPTER 48 as a single generalized tonic-clonic seizure that lasts <15 minutes in children aged 6 months to 6 years with no resulting focal neurologic deficits. These seizures occur in the setting of fever in previously healthy children with no history of epilepsy or signs of central nervous system ( CNS) infection. Three percent to 5% of all children will have a simple febrile seizure. A source should be investigated for a patient presenting with a simple febrile seizure, but an extensive work-up is usually not indicated. A febrile seizure is considered complex if it has focal features, lasts longer than 15 minutes, or occurs more than once in 24 hours. A more extensive work-up including laboratory studies, imaging, and lumbar puncture should be strongly considered in those presenting with complex febrile seizures. ..... Physical Examination Vital signs and general appearance should always be evalu\u00ad ated before proceeding with the remainder of the physical exam. Heart rate can be elevated approximately 10 bpm for every 1 \u00b0C of elevation in temperature. However, tachycardia out of proportion to fever can indicate sepsis. Children and infants with sepsis differ from adults as they often do not demonstrate hypotension until very late in the course due to a compensatory increase in cardiac output. Thus a nor\u00ad mal blood pressure is not necessa rily reassuring. Tachycardia and poor peripheral perfusion occur before hypotension and can be early signs of impending circulatory collapse. Evaluating the general appearance of an infant or child with fever is also crucial. Infants or children who are lethargic or demonstrate paradoxical irritability ( eg, inconsol able when held by parents) may have a CNS infection. A head-to-toe physical exam should be performed. Special attention should be paid to the ante\u00ad rior fontanelle in infants; a bulging tense fontanelle may indicate meningitis, whereas a sunken fontanelle may indicate severe dehydration. In older children, assessment of neck pain, stiffness, and range of motion may also be useful in helping establish a diagnosis of CNS infection. Evaluate the lung fields for crackles, asymmetry, and work of breathing. Forced expiration and percussion may assist in the detection of areas of consolidation. Carefully examine the skin to identify any rashes, petechiae, or purpura. Meningococcemia should be assumed in a febrile, ill-appearing child with a petechial or purpuric rash until proven otherwise. Addition ally, jaundice in a neonate may indicate the presence of sepsis but is not a specific finding. The extremities should be examined closely for erythema, swelling, warmth, focal tenderness, and decreased range of motion, as this may indicate osteomyelitis, pyomyositis, or septic arthritis. These infections are more common in children than in adults. A reassuring clinical examination in infants <3 months does not necessarily rule out an SBI and should not be used in isolation to guide management in this age group. DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES ..... Laboratory Laboratory tests to consider include a complete blood count, urinalysis, urine culture, blood culture, and cere\u00ad brospinal fluid (CSF) studies. The appropriate tests to order, if any, depend on the history and physical examina\u00ad tion, clinical appearance, age, and risk factors for SBI. ..... Imaging A chest x-ray (CXR) may be helpful in identifying pulmo\u00ad nary infection in patients with tachypnea, cough, hypoxia, or other signs of lower respiratory tract disease. Signs of osteomyelitis may not be apparent on plain radiographs until the infection has been present for at least 7-10 days. Additional imaging, including computed tomography for intra-abdominal infection, may be helpful depending on the patient's specific signs and symptoms. MEDICAL DECISION MAKING The differential diagnosis for acute fever in an infant or child is broad and includes minor illnesses, such as viral infections, upper respiratory infections, and otitis media, to more significant illnesses, including pneumonia, pyelo\u00ad nephritis, septic arthritis, and cellulitis, to potentially life-threatening infections, including Kawasaki disease, meningitis, bacteremia, and sepsis. Because the differential diagnosis is so broad, and fever is so common, the approach to the febrile child is based on several factors, including age, clinical impression (well or ill-appearing), physical examination (source or no source), and risk stratification (high or low risk for SBI) (Figure 48-1). Febrile infants <30 days old, even if they are well appearing, should have a full septic work-up, which includes complete blood count with manual diff erential, blood cul\u00ad ture, urinalysis, urine culture, and lumbar puncture. CSF should be sent for cell count, protein and glucose levels, Gram stain, and culture. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) poly\u00ad merase chain reaction should be considered in neonates and those who are high risk. Urine must be collected in a sterile manner, using bladder catheterization or suprapubic aspiration. Bagged specimens are not helpful and are fre\u00ad quently contaminated by skin flora. Based on symptoms, additional studies may be considered; liver function testing should be assessed if an infant presents with jaundice, and stool studies can be sent if diarrhea is present. Well appearing infants age 1-3 months are classified as low or high risk for SBI. Their risk stratification is dependent on history, physical exam, and basic initial lab results. To qualify as low risk, an infant must be previously healthy without any comorbi dity, nontoxic appearing, without a focus of infection (excluding otitis media), dem\u00ad onstrate normal lab values, and have reliable caregivers who can ensure close follow-up. The Rochester Criteria, the Philadelphia Protocol, and the Boston Criteria are the IV antibiotics; admit PEDIATRIC FEVER History and physical exam to identify source of fever LP; IV antibiotics; admit +/-1M antibiotics; discharge with 24-hr follow-up (if antibiotics given, perform LP} No antibiotics Discharge with 24-hr follow-up (UA in boys < 1 year and girls < 2 years) Figure 48-1.

Although all three have limitations, they have attempted to create sensitive, specific screening criteria to identify infants at low risk for SBI. Lower risk stratification can be considered if the white blood cell (WBC) count is between 5 and 15,000, band to neutrophil ratio is <0.2, and urinalysis with <8 WBC per high-power field. alone is not suffi\u00ad cient to forego lumbar puncture in this age group. The decision to perform lumbar puncture depends on several factors, including laboratory results, urinalysis, vaccination status, and presence or absence of viral symptoms. Well appearing children 3-36 months are at lower risk for disseminated infections and can generally be managed based on the nature of the infection, without an extensive work-up for SBI. Fever in this age group is most commonly caused by viral infections. The incidence of occult bacteremia in well-appearing febrile children in this age group has steadily decreased due to routine administration of both the Hib and pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data now reflect that the cur\u00ad rent rate of occult bacteremia bacteremia will resolves spontaneously without intervention. Thus several acceptable variations in management exist for this patient cohort. The evaluation of well-appearing children age 3-36 months includes urinalysis and urine culture for girls <2 years of age and boys < 1 year of age, particularly if they are uncircumcised. A CXR may be performed if there are signs of lower respiratory infection. If no source is identified after this focused evaluation, reassurance and CHAPTER 48 Table 48-1.

Toxic-appearing febrile infants and children, regard\u00ad less of age, require a full septic work-up, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and admission. Fever in immuno compromised children should also be aggressively managed as outlined previously followed by prompt communication with their subspecia lty providers. Antibiotics sho uld never be delayed to complete a septic evaluation. TREATMENT Fever may be treated with an antipyretic such as acetaminophen (10-15 mglkg) every 4 hours or ibuprofen (5-10 mg/kg) every 6 hours as needed to ensure patient com\u00ad fort. It is important to note that correlation between defer\u00ad vescence with an antipyretic and incidence of SBI has not been established and should not affect clinical decision mak\u00ad ing. Ample fluid intake should be encouraged. Some patients may require intravenous fluids if dehydration is present. Patients with an identifiable focus of infection should be treated with the most appropriate antibiotic regimen. For fever without a source, empiric antibiotics may be given, based largely on the patient's age and risk stratification. Infants who are <1 month of age should be treated with antibiotic therapy directed at the most common pathogens causing SBI in this age group (Listeria, Escherichia coli, Group B Strep, and other gram-negative organisms). Ampicillin plus either gentamicin or a third\u00ad generation cephalosporin provide adequate coverage. Ceftriaxone is usually avoided in patients less than 2-4 weeks secondary to concern for biliary sludging. Acyclovir is not recommended empirically for this age group, but may be added to cover HSV if there is a history of seizures, skin lesions are present, or the patient is acutely ill. Infants who are 1-3 months old who fully meet low\u00ad risk criteria may be given a single dose of ceftriaxone before discharge to cover occult bacteremia or UTis. However, this dosing does not fully cover meningitis from these organisms and can complicate future decision mak\u00ad ing if the CSF has not been obtained before administration of antibiotics. Do not administer antibiotics in these patients unless a lumbar puncture has been performed. Alternatively, some providers will observe patients in this category as long as they have reliable caregivers who are able to evaluate the infant for changes in symp\u00ad toms and readily access further care if the patient's condi\u00ad tion changes. In both approaches, it is imperative that the PEDIATRIC FEVER provider has a reliable way to reach the primary caregiver and is able to communicate clearly regarding expectations. Follow-up within 24 hours should be arranged before dis\u00ad charge. Infants who do not meet low-risk criteria should have a full sepsis work-up, receive empiric antibiotics, and be admitted for further inpatient monitoring. Infants and children 3-36 months with a temperature >39\u00b0C and elevated WBC > 15,000 historica lly received ceftriaxone 50 mglkg for possible occult bacteremia after blood cultures have been obtained. Because of decreased rates of occult bacteremia secondary to widespread pneumoco ccal vaccination, outpatient observation without empiric antibiotics is reasonable. Children in this age group with a urinalysis consistent with UTI who are otherwise well-appearing may be treated as outpatients with oral antibiotics (usually a third-generation cephalo\u00ad sporin). Children in this age group with a temperature <39\u00b0C and a reassuring physical examination can be reasonably managed as outpatients if good follow-up can be assured. Lastly, if meningitis is highly s uspected or CSF Gram stain identifies an organism in any of the preceding age groups, ceftriaxone 100 mg/kglday and vancomycin should be administered promptly in the ED. DISPOSITION ..... Admission Toxic-appearing infants and children with fever require a full septic work-up, urgent treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics, and admission. Additionally, all infants < 1 month of age with documented fever or history of fever at home should be admitted for further observation and treatment after a full septic work-up. Well-appearing infants 1-3 months with a high risk of SBI or with a documented focal bacterial illness also require admission. If a patient is immunoc ompromised and presenting with fever, they also are also usually treated with broad-spec\u00ad trum antibiotics and admitted. ..... Discharge Febrile patients older than 3 months who are well\u00ad appearing, vaccinated, and have access to appropriate follow-up can be discharged home. Additiona lly, low-risk patients who are 1-3 months old may also be discharged home as long as reliable follow-up within 24 hours can be guaranteed. SUGGESTED READING Alpern ER, Henretig FM. Fever.

McQueen, MD Key Points Respiratory disorders are potentially life-threatening and must be identified and treated rapidly. Certain physiologic differences make pediatric patients more at risk of respiratory failure than adults. Conduct patient assessment in a calm, efficient manner, attempting to localize the underlying source of distress. INTRODUCTION Respiratory distress is a very common presentation in the emergency department (ED).It accounts for 10% of pedi\u00ad atric visits to the ED, 20% of pediatric admissions, and 20% of deaths in infants. Respiratory distress can poten\u00ad tially lead to respiratory failure (the inability of oxygen\u00ad ation and ventilation to meet metabolic demands) and should be recognized and treated promptly. Several anatomic and physiologic characteristics put pediatric patients at higher risk for respiratory compro\u00ad mise. Infants <4 months of age are obligate nose breathers. Nasopharyngeal obstruction significant ly increases the work of breathing. The location of the narrowest part of the airway, where a foreign body is likely to lodge, differs in adults (vocal cords) and children (cricoid cartilage ). The diameter of the pediatric airway is a third that of adults. Narrowing of the airway leads to a greater relative increase in resistance to airflow (1-mm occlusion decreases cross\u00ad sectional diameter by 20% in adults vs. 75% in children). Abdominal musculature is a primary contributor to respi\u00ad ratory effort in children . Abdominal distension and muscle fatigue can negatively impact ventilation. Pediatric 1 ungs have a lower functional residual capacity (FRC) with less reserve potential. PaO 2 decreases more rapidly when venti\u00ad lation is interrupted. Initial treatment may be required for stabilization before a complete history and physical examination can be performed. Patient appearance and clinical status always supersede lab values and imaging. Respiratory distress may result from either upper air\u00ad way obstruction, lower airway disorders, or other organ dysfunction compromising the respiratory system. Upper airway obstruction is the leading cause of life-threatening acute respiratory distress. Upper airway obstruction is defined as blockage of airflow in the larynx or trachea. It is characterized by stridor, an inspiratory sound caused by air flow through a partially obstructed upper airway. The age of the patient can aid in diagnosis. Common causes of upper airway obstruction in chil\u00ad dren <6 months include laryngotracheomalacia (chronic, usually resolves by age 2) and vocal cord paresis or paralysis. Laryngomalacia and tracheomalacia are con\u00ad genital conditions that affect the structural integrity of supporting structures in the upper airway. This leads to collapse of the affected tissues into the airway during respiration. In children >6 months, important causes of upper air\u00ad way obstruction include viral croup, thermal or chemical burn, or allergic reaction. Croup (laryngotracheobronchitis) is the most common cause of upper airway obstruction and stridor in children aged 3 months to 3 years. It occurs in 5% of children during their second year of life and is caused by a viral infection 206 RESPIRATORY DISTRESS affecting the subglottic region. The patient presents with a barking cough, inspiratory stridor, and fever. Upper airway obstruction from foreign body aspiration is most common in children aged 1 to 4 years. About 3,000 patients die each year from asphyxia related to for\u00ad eign body aspiration. Bacterial infections in the upper airway include epiglotti\u00ad tis and tracheitis. Epiglottitis is less common now since routine immunization against Haemophilus influenzae type B. Currently, tracheitis is more likely to be the cause of acute respiratory failure from airway obstruction than epiglottitis. Lower airway obstruction has several causes, including asthma, bronchiolitis, pneumonia, allergic reaction, respi\u00ad ratory distress syndrome, aspiration, and environmental or traumatic insults. Asthma is the most common chronic disease in children, affecting 5-10% of the population. Bronchiolitis is most famously caused by respiratory syncy\u00ad tial virus (RSV), although other pathogens include parain\u00ad fluenza, influenza, and adenovirus. It is a respiratory infection that causes inflammation of the bronchioles. Edema and mucous production lead to obstruction of the airways with V/Q mismatch and hypoxia. It is most com\u00ad mon in infants 2 to 6 months and is associated with increased likelihood of asthma developing in the future. Pneumonia incidence varies inversely with age, whereas the etiology changes based on the season and age of the patient. Important secondary causes of respiratory distress include congenital heart disease, cardiac tamponade, myocarditis/pericarditis, tension pneumothorax, central nervous system infection, toxic ingestion, anemia. CLINICAL PRESENTATION ..,._History Initial treatment may be required for stabilization before a complete history and physical examinat ion can be performed. Ask for a description of respiratory problems, including onset, duration, and progression of symptoms. Keep in mind that respiratory distress can present as difficulty with feedings in infants and decreased activity or feeding in tod\u00ad dlers. Inquire about precipitating or exacerbating factors. Ask if there was any recent history of choking, as this may be the only clue for a foreign body aspiration. Inquire if they have ever had a similar presentation in the past. Review all prior medications (chronic and acute) and note time of administration. For example, how many times albuterol was given per day in the past several days and the last time given before coming to the ED. Ask if immuniza\u00ad tions are up to date, as failure to do so could put the child at risk for rare diseases (ie, epiglottitis, pertussis ). Review in detail all past medical history. Infants born prematurely may have bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), making reactive airway disease, respiratory inf ections, hypoxia, and hypercarbia more likely. When treating children with asthma, ask about frequency of exacerbati ons, if they ever required intubation or positive pressure ventilation, previ\u00ad ous admissions (ED, general floor, intensive care unit) and the last time they were on steroids. A history of chronic cough or multiple previous episodes of pneumon ias may be suggestive of a congenital condition, undiagnosed reac\u00ad tive airway disease, or foreign body aspiration. ..,._ Physical Examination The assessment should be conducted in a calm, efficient manner, with assistance from parents. Agitating a child can worsen symptoms and even precipitate acute decompensa\u00ad tion, especially in suspected upper airway obstruction. Allow the child to assume a position of comfort. Take extra caution if the patient is presenting in the sniffing position (head and chin are positioned slightly forward), as this may indicate severe upper airway obstruction. Likewise, if the patient is presenting in the tripod position (leaning forward and supporting the upper body with their hands), this indi\u00ad cates severe lower airway obstruction, and this position will optimize their accessory muscle use. Respiratory rate varies in relation to age: newborn (30-60); 1-6 months (30-40); (20-30); 6 years (15-20). Heart rate also varies with age: newborn (140-160), 6 months (120-160), 1 year (100-140), years (80-llO), 6-14 years (75-100), >14 years (60-90). Keep in mind that tachycardia is typical with albuterol treatment. Skin exam can show diaphoresis, cyanosis (peripheral or central), rash (eg, hives), bruising, or trauma and can be a clue to the cause of respiratory distress. Make sure to fully unclothe the patient, taking care not to worsen distress. Stridor indicates upper airway obstruction, and the phase of the respiratory cycle in which it occurs is a clue to the location of obstruct ion. Inspiratory stridor is seen with upper airway obstruction. Expiratory stridor is consistent with obstruction below the larynx, in the bronchi or lower trachea. Croup is the most common cause, but also mass. Inspect the chest for depth, rhythm, and symmetry of respirations. Retractions indicate accessory muscle use. As the involved muscle move more superiorly (sub\u00ad costal, intercostal, suprasternal, supraclavicular ), airway obstruction is more severe. Also examine the chest and neck for any crepitus. Lung exam is particularly important. Pneumothorax is suggested by unilateral decreased or absent breath sounds, but this finding is not always present. Wheezing and a pro\u00ad longed expiratory phase indicate lower airway obstruction. It is important to note that in patients with very severe lower airway obstruction, wheezing may be absent as a CHAPTER 49 result of poor aeration. Crackles, rhonchi, and decreased or asymmetric breath sounds are found with alveolar disease. Grunting prevents alveolar collapse and preserves func\u00ad tional residual capacity (FRC). Its presence implies severe respiratory compromise. The remainder of the physical exam should focus on localizing the underlying source of distress, especially if there is no evidence of airway disease. Poor respiratory effort or apnea with depressed airway reflexes suggests central nervous system disease. Congestive heart failure can present with diminished heart sounds, a murmur or gallop, venous distension, or hepatosplenomeg aly. Pallor or cyanosis suggests anemia. Consider sepsis or metabolic acidosis with isolated tachypnea. Look for any signs of ingestion or inhalation injury, such as burns or soot in the oropharynx or nares. DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES ...... Laboratory The majority of causes of respiratory distress can be deter\u00ad mined with a careful history and physical exam, and clini\u00ad cal appearance always supersedes lab studi es. Arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis may be useful for moderate/ severe respiratory distress, diabetic ketoacidosis, or other metabolic disorders. It is important to note that a \"normal\" ABG in severe respiratory distress is actually quite worri\u00ad some, because this may indicate that the patient is starting to tire out and retain more C02, thus normalizing the C02 and pH but heading toward impending respiratory failure. Respiratory failure can be defined as PaO 2 <60 mmHg despite supplemental 02 of 60% or PaC02 >60 mmHg. The complete blood count identifies anemia and provides supportive evidence of an infectious process when leukocy\u00ad tosis or a left shift is present. Electrolytes may be useful if the suspected cause of distress is metabolic in origin. RSV and influenza testing are rarely helpful in the ED setting . ..... Imaging Chest x-ray may reveal (esophagus vs. trachea) of an aspirated coin in a child can be determined by the orientation of the coin on the radiograph. When the coin is in the esophagus, it lies in the frontal (coronal) plane and is round on posteroanterior view (Figure 49-1). The opposite is true when the coin is in the trachea. It appears round on the lateral radiograph. This is because the incom\u00ad plete cartilaginous rings of the trachea open posteriorly. The majority of aspirated foreign bodies are radiolucent (eg, peanut), but radiographs may still provide clues to its presence. Complete bronchial obstruction produces resorption atelectasis distally. Pulmonary infiltrates may be seen because of an inflammatory reaction to the foreign body. Partial obstruction in a bronchus is identified on an expiratory film when there is air trapping and limited Figure 49-1. A, B. Coin in the esophagus of a 1 0-month-old infant who presented with wheezing. Note the airway compression on the lateral view (arrow). expiration on the affected side. In young children it is very difficult to get the patient to cooperate for expiratory films, so if there is a suspicion of air trapping, bilateral lateral decubitus films can be very useful instead (Figure 49-2). Soft tissue neck radiograph may reveal a thumbprint sign of epiglottitis (Figure 49-3), the steeple sign of croup, or a widened retropharyngeal space seen abscess (Figure 49-4). Neck computed required for definitive diagnosis of retropharyngeal abscess or other deep space infections of the neck causing airway obstruction. RESPIRATORY DISTRESS .&. Figure 49-2.

MEDICAL DECISION MAKING Assess and stabilize airway, breathing, and circulation as a first priority. Apply pulse oximetry, cardiac monitor, and provide supplemental oxygen and intravenous (N) fluids immedi\u00ad ately. Respiratory arrest means that cardiac arrest will either be present or imminent. These patients require endotracheal intubation. Jaw thrust, suction of airway secretions, and use of bag-valve mask is performed if needed before intubation. If there are signs of impending respiratory failure (eg, depressed level of consciousness, decreased response to pain, agitation, cyanosis despite oxygen therapy, tachy\u00ad pnea, bradypnea, apnea, irregular breath grunting, severe retractions, .&.

If the patient has known trauma and unilateral decreased breath sounds, assume a tension pneumothorax and perform needle thoracostomy initially. For definitive management, then perform a tube thoracostomy (see Chapter 7). If foreign body is suspected, perform appropriate maneuvers to relieve the obstruction based on age and the size of the patient. If there is severe stridor at rest and fever, assume epiglottitis/ bacterial tracheitis/retropharyngeal abscess and arrange for emergent definitive airway to be placed in the operating room with the physician most skilled in difficult airway tech\u00ad niques. In some cases, the ED physician must perform emer\u00ad gent endotracheal intubation in the ED. It is extremely important to have all difficult airway backup equipment, including a needle tracheotomy tray immediately available. If the patient is presenting with a severe asthma exacerbation or allergic reaction and does not have adequate respiratory effort, give epinephrine via intramuscular route immediately while preparing for emergent intubation, if no response to initial treatment. With severe wheezing not responsi ve to bronchodilator therapy alone, if the patient is at an age when they can cooperate and are still alert, an initial attempt with positive pressure ventilation with bilevel positive airway pres\u00ad sure can be very helpful to decrease work of breathing and prevent need for intubation. New evidence suggests that high-flow nasal cannula with humidified oxygen can prevent need for endotracheal intubation in some cases. If there are no signs of impending respiratory failure and no immediate life-saving intervention is needed, then let the patient assume a position of comfort to optimize respiratory effort and do not agitate. Obtain a brief history and start treatment based on the suspected disease process. Order labs and imaging that may help with the diagno sis. Sometimes, a lab result or radiograph will indicate need for emergent directed treatment (eg, foreign body). It is extremely important to frequently reassess the patient after each treatment to determine response and make decisions for further management. Clinical status can change very quickly in patients with respiratory distress (Figure 49-5). TREATMENT Croup. Administer humidified oxygen, and all patients should get dexamethasone 0.6 mg!kg/dose (max 16 mg) intramuscular (IM) or by mouth (PO) regardless of the RESPIRATORY DISTRESS severity. If there is stridor at rest, give racemic epinephrine 0.5 mL of 2.25% solution in 3 mL of normal saline (NS) via a nebulizer. Foreign body aspiration. Definitive management is to remove in the operating room by laryngoscopy or bron\u00ad choscopy. In the setting of critical airway obstruction or impending/ actual respiratory arrest, attempt to force the foreign body out with back blows or chest or abdominal thrusts depending on the age and size of the patient. These are all safer methods than the blind finger sweep, which can convert a partial obstruction to a complete obstruction. Other life-saving measures include laryngoscopy and direct retrieval with Magill forceps, passing the endotracheal tube beyond the obstruction and forcing the foreign body into either mainstem bronchus , or needle cricothyrotomy. Epiglottitis or bacterial tracheitis. It is particularly important to allow the patient to assume a position of com\u00ad fort, and if they are in the sniffing position, this is an omi\u00ad no us sign for severe obstruction. Ideally these patients should have a definitive airway placed in the operating room by the most skilled physician in difficult airway techniques, but if there is respiratory arrest, then immediate endotracheal intu\u00ad bation or needle cricothyrotomy should be performed. severe angioedema. Treat with epi\u00ad nephrine, steroids, H2 blockers. Asthma. Treat with -adrenergic agonists: albuterol 2.5 mg every 20 minutes as needed or 15 mg inNS nebulized over 1 hour continuousl y. For moderate to severe exacerba\u00ad tions, add anticholinergics (ipratropium bromide 500 meg every 20 minutes for 3 doses) and steroids. If tolerating oral intake with no impending respiratory failure, administer prednisone 1-2 mg/kglday; otherwise use N steroids (Solu\u00ad Medrol 2 mglkg, max 125 mg). If the patient's respiratory effort is poor and respiratory failure is imminent, administer IM epinephrine 0.01 mg/kgldose (max 0.5 mg) 1:1,000, which can be repeated every 20 minutes for 2 more doses. Terbutaline 2-10 meg N loading dose then 0.1-0.6 meg/kg/ min can also be used. Magnesium sulfate (50 mg/kg over 20 minutes to max 2 g) should be considered in patients with moderate to severe exacerbations or those who do not improve after initial therapy. Heliox, a mixture of helium and oxygen, improves laminar flow through the bronchioles, resulting in decreased work of breathing. There is some evidence showing it improves pulmonary function in patients with severe obstruction. The maximum amount of oxygen in the mixture is 30%, so if the patient is hypoxic and requires more than 30% FlO 2, then Heliox is not an option. Bronchiolitis. Attempt a trial with -agonists and/or nebulized epinephrine. Clinical trials demonstrate that corticosteroids are of no benefit in the treatment of bron\u00ad chiolitis, but they may be useful in patients with a history of reactive airway disease. High-flow humidified oxygen via nasal cannula is a more novel treatment that is showing some promising utility, especially in patients with RSV and hypoventila tion. The proposed mechanisms are improvement of respiratory mechanics, washout of naso\u00ad pharyngeal dead space, and decreased work of breathing. Some recent studies showed that it may decrease need for endotracheal intubation. Hypertonic saline (3-5%) with or without bronchodilators is another new therapy being studied, with minimal side effects. Pneumonia. Administer antibiotics early and oxygen as needed. DISPOSITION .....Admission Admission is indicated in respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, respiratory distress not reversible with definitive therapy or requiring intensive monitoring, pneumonia in patients <6 months, foreign body aspirations with respiratory symptoms, or new oxygen requirements. ..... Discharge The decision to discharge a patient is dependent on several factors: clinical response to treatment, work of breathing, hypoxia, hydration status, preexisting medical conditions, and social factors. Keep in mind that respiratory status can change quickly, and it is crucial to monitor a patient for a significant amount of time after treatment to make sure their clinical status does not deteriorate again. If the patient continues to have increased work of breathing and there is concern for impending respiratory failure, these patients should not go home. Ensure the patient is well hydrated and can tolerate oral intake before discharge. Make sure the patient has reliable caregivers who can administer treatments and medications and will bring the patient back if they worsen again. Lastly, arrange secure follow-up for the patient with his or her pediatrician or specialist. SUGGESTED READING Cantor RM, Wittick L.

Abdominal Pain Russ Horowitz, MD Key Points Currant jelly stool is a late finding in intussusception. In appendicitis, young children have a very high rate of rupture on presentat ion. INTRODUCTION Abdominal pain in children is one of the most common complaints in pediatrics. Etiologies range from benign conditions such as constipation to surgical emergencies such as malrotation with volvulus. The challenge for the clinician is to distinguish between these diseases in preverbal children and in those with limited ability to describe their symptoms. Some conditions such as pyloric stenosis are unique to young children, but others, such as appendicitis which occur in all ages, have dramatically different presentations in the very young. Although less common than in adults, children may still suffer from gallstones, peptic ulcer disease, and kidney stones. Pelvic disorders including ovarian cysts and torsion must be considered in all girls over the age of menarche. Surgical Causes of Abdominal Pain Pyloric stenosis. Usually presents in the newborn period from 2 to 6 weeks of age. It is more common in first-born male children (4:1) and has a familial inheritance. The typical presentation is with postprandial projectile vomit\u00ad ing. After vomiting, children still appear hungry and will readily feed. Early on they seem well, but as symptoms progress they become dehydrated and develop the stereo\u00ad typical electrolyte abnormality of hypokalemic, hypochlo\u00ad malrotation with volvulus. Nonabdominal conditions including strep pharyngitis and pneumonia often present with abdominal pain. Intussusception. This is a telescoping of bowel into a proximal segment. In young children 2 months to 2 years old, the condition is usually idiopathic, and the most common location is ileocolic. Over the age of 3 years, a lead point such as a polyp or Meckel diverticulum may be the culprit. The typical presentation is intermit tent colicky abdominal pain of a few minutes' duration associ\u00ad ated with vomiting. These episodes of pain are followed by periods of lethargy. Unfortunately, the classic triad of symptoms-currant jelly stools, vomiting, and colicky abdominal pain-occurs in only 20% of patients. Physical exam may reveal an empty right lower quadrant and non\u00ad tender mass in the right upper quadrant. Prolonged duration leads to bowel ischemia and necrosis. Henoch\u00ad Schonlein purpura is associated with ileo-ileal intussus \u00ad ception. Because of this unusual location, it is neither visualizable nor reducible by standard methods and requires computed tomogra phy (CT) scan and surgical reduction. Meckel diverticulum. common congenital abnormality of the gastrointestinal tract, Meckel diverticu\u00ad lum is the remnant of the vitelline duct. In half of all cases there is ectopic tissue (usually gastric). Painless rectal bleeding is the most common presentation of Meckel, but other symptoms include abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. The rules of 2s is a good way to classify the con\u00ad dition (Table 50-1). 212 ABDOMINAL PAIN Table 50-1. Meckel diverticulum and rule of 2s. 2% of the population 2 years old most common age of presentation 2 inches long 2 feet from the ileocecal valve 2 types of ectopic tissue (gastric and pancreatic) Malrotation and volvulus. This entity refers to abnor\u00ad mal intrauterine rotation and fixation of bowel within the abdomen. This abnormal development around a narrow mesenteric pedicle puts the bowel at risk of twisting around these vessels and subsequent bowel necrosis. Classic symptoms include bilious vomiting, abdominal pain, distention, and bloody diarrhea. Appendicitis. Although uncommon in young chil\u00ad dren, more than 80% present after the appendix has ruptured. Their presentation is often atypical, with a high rate of diarrhea and absence of typical migration of pain. Medical Causes of Abdominal Pain Constipation. Constipation is particularly common in toddlers around potty training age. Symptoms include diffuse colicky abdominal pain, anorexia, hard stools, and straining. Constipation can be confused with intus\u00ad susception because of the intermittent nature of the pain. Gastroenteritis. This entity is prevalent in childhood, particularly in those children in daycare. The most likely agents are viral; bacterial should be considered in those with bloody diarrhea. Pain is associated with abdomina l cramping. Fever, vomiting, diarrhea, and pain are all symptoms of the condition. Appendicitis particularly early in the course of illness is often mistaken for acute gastroenteritis. CLINICAL PRESENTATION History A careful, detailed history is essential in the evaluation of the pediatric patient with abdominal pain. Questions should be asked of both the caregiver and child. Most pre\u00ad schoolers over the age of 3 or 4 years old can provide reli\u00ad able information. Inquire about the location of pain (diffuse vs.localized) and whether it has remained consis\u00ad tent or migrated (as in the case of appendicitis from peri\u00ad umbilical to right lower quadrant ). The duration of the pain is essential to distinguish between acute and chronic conditions. Ask about associated symptoms such as vomit\u00ad ing (bloody, bilious, projectile, post prandial ), diarrhea (bloody, currant jelly), anorexia, dysuria, and fever (height and duration). Physical Examination Before focusing on the abdomen, a thorough physical examination is necessary to rule out extraabdominal conditions, which can present with abdomina l pain. Assess the pharynx for exudate and skin for the stereotypi\u00ad cal sandpaper rash, as strep pharyngitis and scarlet fever can produce diffuse abdominal pain. Carefully examine the lower extremities and buttocks for the characteristic purpuric lesions of Henoch-SchO nlein purpura, which can produce abdominal pain and ileo-ileal intussusception. Auscultate the lungs, as lower lobe pneumonia will irritate the diaphragm, resulting in pain that may even over\u00ad shadow the cough. A thorough genitourinary evaluation is necessary to rule out genitourinary causes, including testicular torsion and hernias. Delicate palpation of the abdomen to assess for focal tenderness and masses will often narrow the differential diagnosis. A firm mass in the left lower quadrant or mid abdomen supports the clinical picture of constipati on, as does hard stool on rectal exam. An olive-shaped mass in the epigastrium of a newborn with postprandial vomiting is pathognomonic of pyloric stenosis. Examination should include abdomina l auscultation and assessment of tenderness, rebound, and guarding. Asking the child \"where does it hurt the most?\" and \"can you show me with one finger?\" enlists assistance and allows accurate identification of the most distressing location of pain. A general assessment of hydration status is essential, as decreased oral intake and vomiting often accompany pediatric abdominal pain. DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES Laboratory General laboratory studies (complete blood count, electrolytes) do not often add significant information in the evaluation of children with abdominal pain. The total white blood cell count in children with appendicitis is often normal. With the correct clinical picture, an elevated absolute neutrophil count is strongly supportive of the condition . A prolonged case of pyloric stenosis will show the stereotypical hypochloremic, hypokalemic, metabolic alkalosis. Imaging Flat and upright abdominal radiographs are useful to look for obstruction, seen as a dilated stomach or bowel with paucity of air distally. Free air under the diaphragm is seen in the case of a ruptured viscus. In intussusception, a stan\u00ad dard x-ray may reveal a paucity of bowel gas in the right lower quadrant (Figure 50-1). Ultrasound is the preferred modality to diagnose appendi citis in children , intussusception, and pyloric stenosis. Classic ultrasound findings include target, hull's eye, and pseudokidney signs (Figure 50-2). Reduction of CHAPTER 50 .&. Figure 50-1. Paucity of distal bowel gas in child with malrotation. .&. Figure 50-2. Ultrasound showing classic target sign in intussuscep tion. .&. Figure 50-3. Fluoroscopy of malrotation with corkscrew sign. intussusception is routinely accomplished under fluoros\u00ad copy with air or barium. CT should be reserved for equivocal cases of appendicitis or when the appendix is not visualized on ultrasound. Upper GI series reveals duodenal obstruction with an abnormal course and \"corkscrew\" appearance in malrotation (Figure 50-3). Meckel diverticulum with tissue is diagnosed with a technetium -99m pertechnetate study, commonly referred to as a Meckel scan. It can also be visualized on ultrasound or CT scan when it acts as a lead point in intussuscept ion. MEDICAL DECISION MAKING Age of patient, history, and physical exam are often sufficient to narrow a differential diagnosis. Consider the following extra abdominal causes of abdominal pain in the investigat ion: gitis, and pneumonia. Children with bilious vomiting or peritoneal findings require immediate surgical evaluation (Figure 50-4) .

Abdominal pain diagnostic algorithm. TREATMENT Pain control is essential in the care of patients. Analgesia does not interfere with the examination; on the contrary, it may even improve one's diagnostic accuracy by facili\u00ad tating patient cooperation and removing less severe aspects of the pain. The treatment of the distress should proceed in parallel with the investigation of the etiology of the pain. In addition, nausea and vomiting often accompany abdominal pain and should be appropriately managed. Intussusception. For ileo-colic intussusception, emergent radiologic reduction is necessary. In cases of unsuccessful radiologic reduction and with ileo-ileal intussuscep \u00ad tions, surgical reduction is indicated to prevent bowel necrosis. CHAPTER 50 Pyloric stenosis. Correction of electrolytes is a prerequisite for surgical repair. Pylorotomy is the treatment of cure. Meckel diverticulum. Surgical resection is curative. Transfusion may be necessary in cases of significant blood loss. Malrotation and volvulus. Emergent surgical repair is essential to minimize bowel necrosis. Constipatio n. Treatments range from mild (laxatives for home use) to invasive (enema, disimpaction ). Rarely, children require admission for continued enemas and nasogastric administration of laxatives. DISPOSITION ..... Admission Children with surgical or suspected surgical causes of abdominal pain should be admitted to the hospital under the care of a surgeon. To prevent exposure to ionizing radiation, children with equivocal examinat ions or ultrasound findings may be admitted for serial abdominal examinations. Intussusception has up to a lOo/o recurrence risk in the first 24 hours after reduction. Most often chil\u00ad dren are admitted after reduction, but the potential exists for discharge from the ED with thorough instructions on when to return. ..... Discharge Children with medical causes of abdominal pain (pharyn\u00ad gitis, urinary tract infection, pneumonia, gastroenteritis) who tolerate oral fluids can be discharged home with close follow-up. The first presentation of etiologies of abdominal pain such as appendicitis or intussusception may be misinterpreted as viral illness. Therefore, very specific return instructions must be provided to the care\u00ad givers on discharge. These include bilious vomiting, wors\u00ad ening pain, localization to the right lower quadrant, and inability to tolerate oral fluids . SUGGESTED READING Bachur RG. Abdominal emergencies.

Dehydration Kristine Cieslak, MD Key Points Dehydration is not a disease; the underlying cause must be identified and treated. Severity of dehydration can be classified using clinical assessment. Management priorities in the emergency department are stabilization of vital signs, replacement of INTRODUCTION Acute evaluation and treatment of children presenting with dehydration represents one of the most common situations in the pediatric emergency department (ED). Dehydration in sick children is often a combination of refusing to eat or drink and losing fluid from vomiting, diarrhea, or fever. In children with vomiting and diarrhea, the underlying problem is actually intravascular volume depletion, not dehydration. Volume depletion represents an equal loss of water and solutes (mainly sodium) from the blood plasma, whereas dehydration denotes a dispro\u00ad portional loss of plasma free water. Children have higher morbidity and mortality rates associated with dehydration than adults due to a higher turnover of fluids and solutes (higher metabolic rates, increased body surface area/mass index, larger total body water content, immature kidneys with relative inability to produce concentrated urine, reliance on caregivers for basic needs). In clinical practice, the clinician attempts to deter\u00ad mine the degree of volume depletion and the underlying cause of dehydration to initiate proper treatment. Gastroenteritis is the most common cause of dehydra \u00ad tion and is due to viruses in 80% of cases (rotavirus 30-50%). The clinical diagnosis of gastroenteritis by defi\u00ad nition requires the presence of diarrhea. However, many intravascular volume deficit and ongoing losses, and correction of electrolyte abnormal ities. Frequent reassessment of clinical status is necessary to monitor the response to treatment. infants with viral gastroenteritis present with isolated diar\u00ad rhea or isolated vomiting. Rotavirus infections are respon\u00ad sible for approximately 3 million cases of diarrhea and 55,000 hospitalizations for diarrhea and dehydration in children <5 years of age each year in the United States. The majority of children with dehydration presenting to the ED have a benign etiology; however, there are serious causes for dehydration that should be considered. Consider appendicitis, intussusception, volvulus, pyloric stenosis, urinary tract infection, hydrocephalus, and diabetes mellitus as potential underlying con\u00ad ditions in the pediatric patient who presents with dehydration. Other causes of dehydration include gastrointestinal (hepatitis, liver failure, drug toxicity), endo\u00ad crine poor oral intake (pharyngitis, stomatitis), and insensible losses (fever, burns, sweating, pulmonary processe s). CLINICAL PRESENTATION ..... History A complete history is necessary to determine the severity of illness and to identify the type of dehydration present. Obtain as much information from the child, and elicit 217 CHAPTER 51 further details and clarifications from the parent or care\u00ad giver. Obtain a detailed description of intake (types of liquids and solids, volume, frequency) and output of urine (frequency, amount, color, odor, hematuria), stool (number, consistency, presence of blood or mucous), and emesis (frequency, volume, bilious or nonbilious, hematemes is). Estimate urine output by the number and saturation of wet diapers in infants and young children. Note the presence of abdominal pain (duration, location, intensity, quality, and radiati on). Inquire about weight loss and activity level. Note the time interval of symptoms. The last episode of vomiting is important in determining when the initiation of an oral trial is advisable. Ask about associated symptoms (fever, headache, neck pain, throat pain, dysuria, urinary frequen cy, rash). Travel and recent antibiotic use are also pertinent. Note underlying diseases that could contribute to dehydra\u00ad tion (kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, cystic fibrosis, hyper\u00ad thyroidism). Contact with ill people and daycare attendance should be considered. Important elements of the past medical history include immunocompromise and malignan cy. Physical Examination The examination begins with assessmen t of the general appearance of the child. Lethargy or listlessness can warn of impending circulatory collapse. Examine the throat for erythema, ulcerations, or tonsillar exudates. Assess the abdomen for tendern ess, rebound, or guardin g. Neurologic exam should include mental status, cranial nerves, strength, and reflexes. Altered mental status or focal neurologic findings can indicate increased intracra\u00ad nial pressure. Capillary refill and skin turgor should be noted. The gold standard for the diagnosis of dehydration is measurement of acute weight loss. True pre-illness weight is rarely known in the acute care setting. An estimate of the fluid deficit is thus made based on clinical assessment (Table 51-1). Any of the two following findings are predictive of clinically significa nt dehydration in chil\u00ad dren: ill appearance, absence of dry mucous mem\u00ad branes, and delayed capillary refill ( > 2 seconds). Other important considerations are abnormal respiratory pattern and skin tenting. Vital signs are an important objective measure and can be normal in a child with dehydrati on. The first sign of mild dehydration in children is tachycardia. Hypotension is a late sign of severe dehydration. DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES Laboratory Laboratory studies are not required if the etiology is appar\u00ad ent and mild-to-moderate dehydration is present. A bed\u00ad side glucose is indicated for all infants and children with altered mental status. Blood sugar may be low (poor intake) or high (diabetic ketoacidosis [DKA)). With mod\u00ad erate-to-severe dehydrati on, electrolyte abnormalities a specific diagnosis: high K (congenital adrenal hyperplasia, in nitrogen/creatinine (renal hypoper fusion). Urinalysis may show glucose, ketones, or signs of infection. Urine\u00ad specific gravity may be elevated in patients with dehydra \u00ad tion, but it is not a reliable measure. Serum sodium should be determined because hypo/hypernatrernia requires spe\u00ad cific treatment regimens. Imaging No imaging is required for most patients presenting to the ED with dehydration. Consider flat/upright abdominal x-rays if there is suspicion for obstruction. Ultrasound or computed tomography ( CT) scan of the pelvis is indicated if appendicitis suspected. Noncontrast head CT scan is indicated when evaluating severe headache or if exam reveals signs of intracranial pressure. Table 51-1. Clinical assessment of severity of dehydration in the pediatric patient. Signs and Symptoms Mild (3-5% body weight) Moderate (5-1 0% body weight) Severe (>lOOfo body weight) Mental status Alert/restless Irritable and drowsy Lethargic Respirations Normal Deep\u00b1 rapid Deep and rapid Pulse Normal Rapid and weak Weak to absent Blood pressure Normal Normal with orthostasis Low Mucous membranes Moist Dry Very dry Tears Present Decreased Absent Skin turgor Pinch and retract Tenting Tenting to doughy Urine output Decreased Absent Capillary refill <2 sec 2-3 sec >3 sec MEDICAL DECISION MAKING History and physical examination are generally sufficient to identify signs or symptoms of dehydration. Shock needs immediate recognition and treatment with fluid resuscita\u00ad tion. Determine severity of dehydration using clinical assessment (Figure 51-1). The underlying cause of dehydration should be identified, and electrolyte abnormalities require correction. Further test\u00ad ing is guided by clinical suspicion of more serious problems. TREATMENT Identify patients with signs of shock and resuscitate with fluid immediately (20 mL/kg normal saline [NS] or Lactated Ringer's over a period). Reassess and repeat fluid bolus until perfusion is adequate and vital DEHYDRATION signs normalize (fluid bolus x 3 if necessary) . Urine output is the most important indicator of restored intravascular volume (minimum= 1 mL/kg!hr). If 60-80 mL/kg of iso\u00ad tonic fluid is given with no improvement, consider other causes of shock (sepsis, hemorrhage, cardiac disease). Treat hypoglycemia promptly (2.5 mL/kg of 10o/o dextrose or 1 mL/kg of 25o/o dextrose). Once vital sign abnormalities are corrected, the rate of fluid administration for treatment is determined by the estimated fluid losses plus ongoing maintenance fluid requirements (Table 51-2). The literature supports the use of a single dose of oral ondansetron in combination with oral rehydration for patients with dehydration due to nausea and vomiting. Ondansetron can be given as an oral dissolving tablet or intravenously (IV; 2 mg, 4 mg). Antidiarrheal agents are not recommended. Rapid oral rehydration has been shown to be as effective as IV fluid therapy in restoring intravascular Signs or symptoms of dehydration Fluid resuscitation Stabilization of vital signs Evaluate for signs of shock Obtain history of all intake and output Assess severity of dehydration Identify underlying disease or illness OraljiV rehydration ppropriate lab or radiographic studies Correct electrolyte abnormal ities Etiology undetermined Admit for continued testing and therapy Etiology determined Admit for further therapy OR discharge if no clinical signs of dehydration and no significant ongoing losses .6.

Patient Weight First 10 kg Second 10 kg Each additional 10 kg 4/2/1 Method Holiday-Segar Method 4 ml/kg/hr 100 mljkg/day 2 ml/kg/hr ml/kg/hr 50 ml/kgfday 20 ml/kg/day volume and correcting acidosis in patients with moderate dehydration. For every 25 children treated with oral rehy\u00ad dration treatment for dehydrati on, 1 fails and requires N therapy. Oral rehydration solutions for infants and tod\u00ad dlers should contain 45-50 mEq/L of sodium and 25-30 giL glucose (Pedialyte, Infalyte). Give 5-10 mL of fluid every 5-10 minutes and increase as tolerated, with the goal of 30-50 mL/kg over a 4-hour period. If voruiting occurs, wait 30 minutes after last episode before reinitiating oral fluids. An estimate for fluid replacement is 10 mL/kg body weight for each watery stool and 2 mL!kg body weight for each episode of vomiting. Dehydration can be categorized according to osmolarity and severity. Serum sodium is a good marker of osmolarity (assuruing a normal glucose) and guides replenishment therapy. Isotonic dehydration is the most common (80%). Sodium and water losses are similar in intra-and extracel\u00ad lular compartments. Maintenance fluid requirements plus half the fluid deficit are administered over the first 8 hours, and the remaining fluid deficit over the following 16 hours. Hypotonic dehydration (Na <130 mEq/L) occurs when more sodium than water is lost. Calculate sodium deficit for replacement fluids. Sodium deficit (mEq) = (135-measured Na) X (pre-illness weight in kg) x 0.6. Sodium deficit should be replaced over a 4-hour period but should not exceed 1.5-2.0 mEq/hr; 0.9 NS is an appro \u00ad priate solution. Hypertonic dehydration (Na >150 mEq/L) exists when more water is lost than sodium. The free water deficit is calculated as free water deficit (mL) = (measured serum Na-145) x 4 mL!kg x pre-illness weight (kg). Because of the risk of cerebral edema, correct the free water deficit over a 48-hour period, with a goal of reducing serum sodium by no more than 10-15 mEq/L!day; D5 \\4 to D5 liz NS are appropriate solutions. DISPOSITION Admission Most patients with moderate -to-severe dehydration with significant acidosis should be admitted to the hospital (serum bicarbonate level of 13 is predictive of return to the ED for treatment failure as outpatient). Other indications for adruission include significant ongoing fluid losses, inability to tolerate oral fluids, hypotonic or hyper\u00ad tonic dehydration, or undetermined etiology in need of further assessment. Patients with signs of increased intra\u00ad cranial pressure or DKA should be adruitted to an intensive care unit. Discharge Patients with no clinical evidence of dehydration or those with mild-to-moderate isotonic dehydration who have received adequate fluid rehydration (oral or N) can be discharged home.

Clinical findings most suggestive of AOM are a bulging tympanic membrane (TM) with a purulent effusion, whereas the TM in OME has a clear effusion with a normal or retracted position. INTRODUCTION Otitis media refers to the presence of inflammation or infection in the middle ear space. A middle ear effusion without infection is called otitis media with effusion ( OME) or serous otitis. Infection of fluid in the middle ear is called acute otitis media (AOM). Diagnosis of AOM should be based on the acute onset of signs or symptoms of middle ear inflamma tion (fever, ear pain, distinct erythema of the tympanic membra ne) in conjunction with a middle ear effusion seen on physical exam. Ear disease is common in children, with 90% of children having at least 1 episode of a middle ear effusion and two thirds with at least 1 episode of AOM by school age. The peak incidence of AOM occurs between 6 and 24 months of age. Episodes of AOM are often preceded by a viral upper respiratory tract infection (URI). The eustachian tube in children is shorter and more horizontal than in adults. Eustachian tube dysfunction associated with a URI can lead to a middle ear effusion (OME). Bacterial pathogens in the nasopharynx ascend via the eustachian tube, leading to infection of the fluid in the middle ear (AOM). AOM is caused by bacteria in 50--80% monly Streptococcus pneumoniae or nontypable 221 Erythema alone is a poor predictor of AOM and must be combined with other TM characteristics to make a diagnosis. Antibiotic treatment may be indicated for some episodes of AOM, but is not indicated for OME. Assess the patient for possible complications of AOM. infl.uenzae and less commonly Moraxella catarrhalis. Purulent otorrhea may be caused by Staphylococcus aureus or Pseudomonas aeruginosa as well. Common complications of AOM are persistent middle ear effusion, tympanic membrane perforation, and tympanosclerosis. Other complications of AOM include cholesteatoma, hearing loss, tinnitus, balance problems, and facial nerve injury. Intracranial complications are rare and include mastoiditis, intracranial ..... History Children with AOM usually present with acute onset of signs and symptoms of inflammation from AOM, such as fever and ear pain. This is often preceded by URI symp\u00ad toms. Many symptoms associated with AOM, such as fever, irritability, restless sleep, and crying, are neither sensitive nor specific for AOM, and may be present in children with a URI with or without AOM. The presence of ear pain increases the relative risk of a patient having AOM. Purulent drainage from the ear may be present with AOM with tympanic membrane perforation or with otitis externa. Previous episodes of AOM, including timing of CHAPTER 52 Parsflaccida Light reflex .A. Figure 52-1. Normal tympanic membrane. Courtesy Richard A. Chole, MD PhD most recent infection and antibiotic use may influence choice of therapy. Persistent fever and headache may be signs of intracranial complications of AOM. Physical Examination Fever, though nonspecific, is present in 50% of cases of AOM. Careful examination of the head and neck, including the oropharynx, teeth, jaw, and lymph nodes, should be done to search for other causes of pain that may be referred to the ear. Inspection of the pinna, tragus, and external auditory canal, as well as palpation of the tragus, should be performed. Pain with manipulation of the pinna or tragus, in conjunction with purulent otorrhea and inflammation of the external auditory canal, suggests otitis externa. The mastoid process should be examined for swell\u00ad ing, erythema, and tenderness, signs of mastoiditis. With mastoiditis, the pinna may also be displaced anteriorly. Diagnosis of AOM or OME is made based on the appearance of the tympanic membrane (TM) on otoscopic examination, in conjunction with the clinical presentation. Adequate visualization of a child's TM requires good patient immobilization, typically with the child seated on the parent's lap with the head immobilized against the parent's chest, as well as use of the largest speculum that will comfortably fit in the external auditory canal. Removal of cerumen from the external auditory canal may be required for good visualization of the TM and can be accomplished with a cerumen scoop or gentle irrigation. Ear irrigation should not be performed if there iss uspicion for a perforated TM. The external auditory canal in children may be narrow and tortuous, and the tympanic membrane is located anteriorly and superior ly. Gentle traction on the pinna in a posterior direction straightens the ear canal and can aid in visualization of the TM. Once adequate visualization is obtained, the following tympanic membrane characteristics should be assessed: translucency (translucent, opaque, partly opaque), color (clear/grey, white, amber, red), position (normal, retracted, bulging), and mobility (normal, decreased or absent). A normal tympanic membrane is translucent and clear with a colorless or pearly gray color, and the bony landmarks of the middle ear are easily visible (Figure 52-1). In addition, a normal TM has a neutral position and brisk mobility with positive and negative pressure on insufflation. Opacity of the TM often obscures the bony landmarks and suggests the presence of fluid in the middle ear or another abnormality of the TM (tympanosclerosis, cholesteatoma) . Other findings consistent with a middle ear effusion are an air fluid level or bubbles behind the TM, a bulging TM, decreased or absent mobility of the TM, or otorrhea. A middle ear effusion is present with both OME and AOM. Characteristics associated with OME include a normal or retracted TM, clear, or amber color, and impaired mobility on insufflation. Characteristics associated with AOM are a bulging TM, a purulent effusion, and distinct erythema of the TM with a middle ear effusion (Figure 52-2). Erythema alone is a poor predictor of AOM because the TM may Figure 52-2. Image showing patient with acute otitis media. Courtesy Richard A. Chole, MD PhD appear pink or red with fever or crying. In addition, it is important to distinguish between distinct erythema of the TM itself (as in AOM) and increased vascularity with a red appearance only in the areas of the blood vessels. DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES ..... Laboratory AOM is a clinical diagnosis, and laboratory studies are usually not required. Gram stain and culture of middle ear fluid obtained by tympanocentesis may be helpful in directing antibiotic therapy in complicated or resistant infections, but is not routinely performed. ..... Imaging A computed tomography (CT) scan of the head may be needed if there is concern for mastoiditis or other intracranial complication. MEDICAL DECISION MAKING History and physical examination should be sufficient to diagnose AOM and distinguish it from OME. If the tympanic membrane is normal, consider alternative causes of ear pain or fever (Figure 52-3). Inflammation of the mastoid process with anterior displacement of the pinna or other signs and symptoms of intracranial exten\u00ad sion of infection should warrant investigation with a head CT. OTITIS MEDIA TREATMENT Antibiotics are not recommended in OME. Analgesics should be given if the child has pain associated with the middle ear effusion. In children <2 years of age, oral antibiotic therapy is indicated in AOM because ear infections in this age group are less likely to resolve without antibiotic therapy. For children 2 years of age with uncomplicated AOM, a \"wait-and-see\" approach to treatment is an option. Because many cases of AOM will resolve without antibiotic therapy, the parent is given a prescription for antibiotics to be given to the patient if symptoms worsen or do not improve in 48-72 hours. Ear pain should always be managed with analgesics as needed, regardless of the therapeutic approach taken. Analgesics for ear pain include oral ibuprofen and acetaminophen as well as topical benzocaine/antipyrine drops. Topical analgesics should not be given if there is concern for a perforated TM. If antibiotic therapy is chosen, high-dose amoxicillin (80-90 mg/kg/day divided BID) is recommended as first\u00ad line treatment for uncomplicated AOM. Treatment dura\u00ad tion is 10 days in children <2 years of age and can be shortened to a 5-7 day course in children >2 years of age with uncomplicated infections. Amoxicillin- clavulanate (90/6.4 mg/kg!day divided BID) may be needed to treat -lactamase producing H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis and should be used for AOM not responsive to amoxicil\u00ad lin. In addition, it may be considered as initial therapy in Ear pain, fever, otorrhea, irritability Age > 2 years, uncomplicated AOM \"Wait-and-see\" prescription No antibiotics Consider alternative diagnosis Figure effusion; TM, tympanic membrane. CHAPTER 52 children with severe disease (fever >39\u00b0C or severe ear pain). Cephalosporins ( cefdinir 14 divided bid, cefpodoxime 10 mg/kg/day once daily) may also be used for treatment failures. Ceftriaxone (50 mg/kg intramuscularly or intra\u00ad venously) may be used to treat AOM in a patient with vomiting and an inability to tolerate oral medications. A single dose is adequate for initial treatment; 3 doses over 3 days are recommended for treatment failures. For patients with a penicillin allergy, a third-generation cephalosporin should be given if it is a non-type I hypersensiti vity. With a type all provide suboptimal coverage. DISPOSITION ..... Admission Only children with complications of AOM, such as mastoiditis or other intracranial complications, require hospitalization. ..... Discharge Non-toxi c-appearing children without complications of AOM may be discharged home. Discharge instructions should be clear, especially if using a \"wait-and-see\" prescription for antibiotics, and should always include treatment of ear pain with analgesics as needed. Patients should be instructed to follow up with the primary care provider if symptoms do not improve in 48-72 hours or earlier if symptoms worsen or there are signs or symptoms of complications of AOM.

INTRODUCTION Sore throat is a common complaint seen in the emergency department (ED). Pharyngitis is inflammation of the throat and is usually the cause of sore throat. Inflammation of the tonsils (ie, tonsillitis) may also be present. The goal of the ini\u00ad tial evaluation of patients with a complaint of sore throat is to exclude the most serious conditions (eg, abscess, epiglottitis). Infectious pharyngitis involves direct invasion of the pharyngeal mucosa by bacteria or viruses leading to a local inflammatory response. Viruses are the most common cause of pharyngitis and include adenovirus, parainfluenza, influenza A and B, (GABHS) is the most common bacterial cause of pharyngitis. It accounts for 15-30% of cases of pharyngitis in children and 5-15% in adults. The peak age group is 5-15 years old. Most cases are seen in the winter and spring. GABHS pharyngitis is rare in patients younger than 2 years. Antibiotics are used to treat GABHS and to prevent suppurative andnonsuppurative complications. Suppurative complications include abscess formation. Nonsuppura tive scarlet acute rheumatic fever (ARF), poststreptococcal glo\u00ad merulonephritis, and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. Scarlet fever, presenting with pharyngitis and a diffuse erythematous rash, is the result of the skin's reactivity to Suspected group A -hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS) infections can be confirmed by performing a rapid antigen screening test or a throat culture. Antibiotic treatment is used to prevent suppurative and nonsuppur ative (immune-mediated) complications GABHS. the release exotoxin by GABHS. ARF is a delayed sequela and strains of GABHS. Children <7 years of age are at the highest risk. Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome is a severe GABHS infections presenting with shock and multi\u00ad system organ failure. The pharynx, skin, mucosa, and vagina can be portals of entry for GABHS resulting in strep\u00ad tococcal toxic shock syndrome. ...... Life-Threatening Causes of Sore Throat Epiglottitis is an infection of the epiglottis and adjacent supraglottic structures that can result in respiratory arrest and death if swelling is severe enough to airway occlusion. The widespread use of Haemophilus influenzae type B (HIB) con\u00ad jugate vaccine in young children has dramatically changed the epidemiology of epiglottitis, and the incidence has decreased. Epiglottitis is currently more often seen in adolescents and adults. Common organisms include Streptococcus pneu\u00ad moniae, Staphylococcus aureus, nontypeable H. influenza, and -hemolytic streptococcus. Retropharyngeal abscess is a deep space neck infection involving the lymph nodes that drain the nasopharynx, adenoids, posterior paranasal sinuses, and middle ear. The disease can start as an infection in these nodes (adenitis) 225 CHAPTER 53 leading to a suppurative adenitis, phlegmon formation, and finally, a retropharyngeal abscess. Incidence peaks between 2 and 4 years of age, as the retropharyngeal lymph nodes are prominent in young children but atrophy before puberty. Peritonsillar abscess (PTA) is a collection of pus between the tonsillar capsule and the palatopharyngeal muscle. It is usually preceded by pharyngitis or tonsillitis with progression from cellulitis to phlegmon, and then abscess. It is the most common deep neck infection in children and adolescents. Infections are polymicrobial and include anaerobic and aero\u00ad bic organisms (GABHS, S. aureus, fusiform, and bacteroides ). CLINICAL PRESENTATION Most patients with pharyngitis will complain of sore throat and fever. Symptoms are acute in onset with GABHS pharyngitis. There is also pain on swallowing (odynophagia) or difficulty swallowing (dysphagia). Young children may not localize the pain to the throat and will complain of head\u00ad ache and/or abdominal pain instead of sore throat. Nausea and vomiting may also be present. Toddlers can present with fever, fussiness, or refusal to take liquids and solids. Coryza, conjunctivitis, and hoarseness are symptoms suggestive of viral illness. Pharyngitis with fever, red eyes, and rash prompts concern for Kawasaki disease (mucocutaneous lymph node syndrom e). Fatigue and anorexia are associated with infectious mononu cleosis. Drooling and the inability to handle oral secretions are seen is patients with epiglottitis, peritonsillar, or retropharyn\u00ad abscess. r etrac\u00ad tions, and stridor) is seen in patients with epiglottitis. Severe unilateral throat pain and inability to open the mouth ( tris\u00ad mus) is seen in patients with a peritonsillar abscess. A muffled or \"hot potato\" voice can be heard in patients with a peri ton\u00ad sillar abscess, but is also present ryngeal abscess. Children with a retropharyngeal abscess may also have neck stiffness and pain with extension of the neck. Physical Examination Airway patency must be assured, and impending airway compromise needs to be rapidly identified. Evaluate the hydration status, focusing on findings that have been cor\u00ad related with dehydration in children. Signs and symptoms include a general \"ill\" appearance, the absence of tears with crying, dry mucous membranes , decreased skin turgor, tachycardia, and delayed (>2 seconds). Auscultate the heart and document murmurs that might suggest the presence of acute rheumatic fever. Patients with epiglottitis will be \"toxic\" appearing, showing signs of respiratory distress with stridor. The patient may prefer to sit in the \"sniffing position\" with the neck extended. Drooling, respiratory distress, and hyperexten sion of the neck are seen in patients with retropharyngeal abscess. Anterior bulging of the posterior pharyngeal wall may be visualized on examination. Those with a peritonsillar abscess may have trismus, \"hot potato\" muffled voice, and drooling with a fluctuant bulge in the posterior aspect of soft palate with contralateral deviation of the uvula (Figure 53-lA). Classic findings in pharyngitis tonsillar erythema, exudates, and hypertrophy (Figure 53-lB). Those with may have a fine, erythematous, \"sandpaper-like\" rash. Palatal petechiae (Figure 53-2. A. Epiglottitis. The epiglottis is located by tracing the base of the tongue inferiorly until it reaches the vallecula. The structure immediately posterior is the epiglottis. If the epiglottis is enlarged (thumb print) and the vallecula is shallow, epiglottitis is present. B. Retropharyngeal abscess. The normal retropharyngeal soft tissue space is <7 mm at C2, <14 mm at C6 in children, and <22 mm at C6 in adults. white or red \"strawberry (inflamed tongue papillae), desquamating in flexor creases) are also suggestive of GABHS infection and scarlet fever. Patients with infectious mononucleosis will have pharyngeal injection with exudates, posterior cervical adenopathy, and hepatosplenomeg aly. A maculopapular rash is often seen in patients who are treated with amoxi\u00ad cillin or ampicillin. DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES ..... Laboratory Rapid antigen detection of GABHS is 70-90% sensitive and 95-100% specific when performed correctly. GABHS diagnosis based solely on clinical grounds is accurate 50% of the time. A negative rapid strep test should be confirmed with a throat culture. Throat culture is the gold standard for diagnosis of GABHS pharyngitis, but results can take up to 48 hours. Approximately 20% of asymptomatic school-aged children are chronic carriers of GABHS. In patients with infectious mononu cleosis, a complete blood count will typically show lymphocytosis with a preponderance of (Monospot) or EBV titers used to confirm the presence of infectious mononucleosis. Monospot is very insensitive in children younger than 4 years of age. Liver enzymes may also be elevated. ..... Imaging A soft tissue lateral neck radiograph may be helpful to visu\u00ad alize an aspirated foreign body or narrowing of the tracheal air column (masses). The \"thumb print'' sign is seen with epiglottitis (Figure 53-2A). Widening of the retropharyngeal space is seen with a retropharyngeal abscess (Figure 53-2B). The normal retropharyngeal soft tissue space is defined as <7 mm at C2, < 14 mm at C6 in children, and < 22 mm at C6 in adults. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the neck may be required for the definitive diagnosis of peritonsillar or retropharyngeal abscess. MEDICAL DECISION MAKING Patients with signs and symptoms of toxicity or severe respiratory distress need to be emergently evaluated for the possibility of epiglottitis, retropharyngeal abscess, or peritonsillar abscess. The history and physical examination will help to differentiate between these conditions. Using either the Strep score (Table 53-1) or modified Centor criteria (Table 53-2) can help in the decision to test and treat patients with pharyngitis (Figure 53-3). Consider an alternative diagnosis of viral pharyngitis or foreign body if clinically indicated. Table 53-1. Strep Score (each factor is worth 1 point).

The Poisoned Patient Sean M. Bryant, MD Key Points A thorough history of present illness including infor\u00ad mation gathered from available friends, family, and emergenc y medical service personnel can be invaluable in the management of poisoned patients. Perform a comprehensive physical exam including a full set of vital signs to help classify the patient's clinical presentation in to a particular toxidrome. INTRODUCTION More than 2 million toxic exposures and poisonings are reported to U.S. regional poison centers annually. Conseque ntly, all emergency physicians should possess a basic fundamental comprehension of emergenc y toxicology and a sound clinical approach for managing the poisoned patient. Depending on the absolute dose and/or duration of exposure, all substances have the potential for harm. Factors including the absorptio n, distributi on, and elimination rate of the inciting agent help determine its overall toxicity. In poisoned patients, the pharmacokinetic features of the toxin ( eg, circulating half-life) can be markedly prolonged secondary to extended absorption times and the saturation of metabo\u00ad lizing enzymes. These toxicokinetic principles often result in an unpredictable onset of symptoms and overall dura\u00ad tion of toxicity. The initial goal in managing a poisoned patient is to provide excellent supportive care. Contact your regional poison center (1-800-222-1222) early in the manage\u00ad ment of your patient as they can provide invaluable support. To aid in making the diagnosis, attempt to clas\u00ad sify the patient's clinical presentation into a specific toxidrome (a syndrome complex that characterizes Always focus on supportive measures first in the clinical management of poisoned patients. Consult your regional poison center (1-800-222-1222) to ensure the appropriate management of poisoned patients. certain classes of poisonings) (Table 54-1). Only by fol\u00ad lowing the preceding guidelines will certain patients be suitable for decontamination measures and possibly focused antidotal care. CLINICAL PRESENTATION History When possible, obtain a thorough history, including the location of the exposure and the patient's occupation. Pill bottles found at the scene or chemical containers noted by emergency medical service, family, or friends may provide the necessary clues to identify the causative toxin. Attempt to establish the exact time of exposure, although this is often limited to when the patient was last seen in a \"normal\" condition. Try to discern the amount that was ingested and whether it was in a regu\u00ad lar or extended release formulation. Finally, try to estab\u00ad lish the chronicity of the exposure, the immediate symptoms after the exposure, a history of previous sui\u00ad cide attempts, a thorough past medical history, and a history of any illicit drug abuse. If known, contacting the patient's regular pharmacy may provide further insight into the case. 230 THE POISONED PATIENT Table 54-1. Common toxidromes.

Obtain a full set of vital signs to evaluate for evidence of hyperpyrexia, hemodynamic instability, and tachypnea/hyp erpnea (which could indicate compensation for significant acidemia ). Characterize the patient's mental status and note any neurologic deficits. Findings such as delirium, central Table 54-2. Agents that affect pupil or frank obtundation/ coma may help to determine the responsible toxin. Perform a careful ocular exam focusing on pupillary size and responsiveness, the presence of nystagmus, and evidence of abnormal lacrimation (Table 54-2). Finally, noting the absence or presence of bowel sounds and whether the skin is dry or wet may help differentiate anticholinergic from sympathomimetic poisoning, respectively. DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES ...,._ Laboratory Obtain a basic metabolic panel looking for electrolyte abnormalities or evidence of renal insufficien cy. Check a serum creatine phosphokinase in all patients with ongoing seizures, prolonged down times, or renal abnormalities, as rhabdomyolysis is a serious concern. Calculation of an anion gap coupled to venous or arterial blood gas analysis may help differentiate acid-base disorders. Co-oximetry with blood gas analysis is also useful to determine CHAPTER 54 methemoglobin and carboxyhemoglobin concentrations. A markedly elevated serum lactate level (>8-10 mmol/L) often indicates serious toxicity from an inhibitor of cellular metabolism (eg, cyanide). Quantitative blood screens for determining the serum concentrations of multiple potential toxins including acetaminophen, salicylates, lithium, carbamaze pine, valproic acid, lead, iron, and digoxin are usually very helpful to guide the management of poisoned patients. That said, qualitative urine toxicology screening rarely changes the work-up, management, or disposition of emer\u00ad gency department patients. The frequent false-positive results ( eg, positive for PCP due to dextromethorphan use) and tests that remain persistent ly positive for several days after the actual exposure ( eg, positive opiates x 7 days after heroin use; positive cocaine x 3 days after cocaine use; positive cannabinoids x 30 days after marijuana use) ren\u00ad der urine toxicology screens challenging to interpret. Electrocardiogram Obtain an electrocardiogram looking for any evidence of dysrhyth mias, conduction blocks, or abnormal intervals. These findings may assist in both the diagnosis and treat\u00ad ment of patients poisoned by cardiotoxic agents. Imaging Obtain computed tomography imaging of the brain when either mental status changes or neurologic deficits are present that are not consistent with the type of poisoning being entertained (eg, focal or lateralizing signs). Order a chest x-ray for all patients complaining of either shortness of breath, hypoxia, toxic fume inhalation, or potential aspi\u00ad ration (eg, hydrocarbon ingestion). Check abdominal x-rays, looking for radio-opaque ingestions (eg, leaded paint chips or toys, batteries, selected drug packets) as indicated to help complete the work-up. MEDICAL DECISION MAKING The first priority must always be supportive care in the man\u00ad agement of the poisoned patient. Use all available historical items to help identify the possible toxin. A thorough physical exam including careful attention to the patient's mental status, vital signs, pupillary size and responsiveness, the pres\u00ad ence of seizures, or abnormal changes in skin color, tern\u00ad perature, and moisture may help classify the patient's presentation into a specific toxidrome. Use the ancill ary studies described previously to help clarify the diagnosis and guide further management (Figure 54-1). TREATMENT The treatment of poisoned patients can be broken down into a very systematic approach outlined by the mnemonic ABCDEFGH. First and foremost, initiate aggressive supportive care. The airway and breathing must be secured and addressed without delay. Intubation may be prevented Toxic exposure or poisoning Supportive care: Address ABC's, IV ccess, supplemental 02-cardiac monitor Lab studies, ECG, identify toxidromes, contact poison control center consider decontamination: Wash patient Activated charcoal Gastric lavage Whole bowel irrigation Consider enhanced elimination: Multi-dose activated charcoal Urinary alkalinization Hemodialysis Consider focused antidotal therapy Figure 54-1 The poisoned patient diagnostic algorithm. ABCs, airway, breathing, and circulation; ECG, electrocardiogram; IV, intravenous. with the successful use of a focused therapy such as naloxone in opioid toxicity or supplemental dextrose in hypoglycemic patients. Likewise, correct any circulatory compromise in the form of hypotension or bradycardia with standard fluid and/or vasopressor administration. Pay careful attention to the core temperature. Aggressively and expeditiously correct hyperpyrexia with active cooling mea\u00ad sures and not systemic antipyretics. These measures, rather than the early search for specific antidotes, are the corner\u00ad stone of the initial management of the poisoned patient. The basic goal of decontamination is to remove the poison from the patient and the patient from the poison. Attempt decontamination as early as possible to achieve maximal benefit. Washing a patient's skin with soap and water to prevent further absorption and/or prevent harm to the emergency staff (eg, a patient covered with an organoph os\u00ad phate) is the simplest form of decontamination. Activated charcoal (1 g/kg or a 10:1 ratio of charcoal to toxin) can be given orally to bind ingested poisons and limit further gas\u00ad trointestinal (GI) absorption. Although most drugs are THE POISONED PATIENT amenable to this, lithium, iron and other metals, hydrocar\u00ad bons, caustics, and toxic alcohols are not. Consider gastric lavage in patients who present very early (within 1 hour) after a potentially lethal ingestion. Addition ally, any poten\u00ad tially fatal ingestions that don't have available antidotes may warrant lavage regardless of the timing of ingestion (eg, massive colchicine overdose). Contraindications to gastric lavage include the ingestion of hydrocarbons or other caus\u00ad tic agents, and potential complications include increased intracranial pressure, aspiration, and esophageal rupture. Whole-bo wel irrigation with polyethylene glycol (GoLYTELY), given at a rate between 0.5 L/hr (pediatrics) and 2 L/hr, may help to \"flush\" toxins that won't bind to charcoal (eg, leaded paint chips) out of the GI tract and therefore limit total absorption. Contraindicat ions to whole-bowel irrigation include hemodynamic instability (hypotension = lack of GI perfusion) and decreased bowel sounds (impaired GI motility) . Of note, pulmonary aspira\u00ad tion is the most common adverse side effect for all forms of GI decontamination, and patients must have an intact air\u00ad way for these procedures to be pursued. There are several different modalities available to enhance the elimination of poisons. Hemodialysis is ideal for smaller-sized poisons with small volumes of distribution ( <1 L/kg) and low degrees of protein-binding. Ideal agents for hemodialysis include aspirin, toxic alcohols, and lithium. Hemodialysis should also be performed in all patients with profound acidemia regardless of the etiology. Alkalinization of the urine is commonly initiated for ingestions of weak acids such as aspirin and phenobarbital. The proposed mechanism depends on increasing the urinary pH by giving doses of intravenous (IV) sodium bicarbonate. Circulating toxins will be preferentially converted to their conjugate bases in the alkaline environment and consequently trapped in the renal tubules, where they will be excreted in the urine. Alkalinization can also benefit patients in select cases ( eg, salicylate overdose) by keeping the poison preferentially out of the CNS, as the ionized form cannot enter through the blood-brain barrier. Finally, multiple doses of oral activated charcoal (MDAC) can be administered to patients poisoned with select agents including theophylline, phenoba rbital, carbamazepine, dapsone, or quinine. The proposed mecha\u00ad nism relies on the use of the GI tract wall as a dialysis mem\u00ad brane. The intraluminal charcoal functions to pull circulating toxins back into the GI tract where they are bound to the charcoal and excreted. MDAC can also be employed to further decontaminate the gut of agents that have erratic and prolonged absorption ( eg, salicylates, val\u00ad proic acid). If MDAC is entertained, ensure that the char\u00ad coal is not premixed with sorbitol, as cathartics (unlike polyethylene glycol) can cause marked fluid and electrolyte shifts, resulting in significant morbidity and/or mortality. Antidotal therapy is important and necessary when managing the poisoned patient, but should never take priority over the supportive measures already mentioned. Examples of selected focused therapy along with general indications are listed in Table 54-3. The final portion of the Table 54-3. Specific antidotes for toxicologic agents.

This is a reminder for clinicians to never hesitate in calling their regional poison center (1-800-222-1222) for assistance during any point in the care of the poisoned patient. Getting help early may facilitate a more focused work-up, prevent unnecessary laboratory and/or diagnostic studies, provide insight into potentially life-saving antidotal therapy, and assist with appropriate disposition making. DISPOSITION ..... Admission All patients with hemodynamic abnormalities, persistent mental status changes, and metabolic or acid-base irregularities should be admitted to an intensive care setting. Addition ally, those who ingested medications that either require antidotal therapy or have prolonged or delayed toxic effects ( eg, sulfonylureas, extended- release calcium channel blockers, or beta-blockers) also require admission to a critical care setting. All suicidal patients will require psychiatric consultation for clearance. CHAPTER 54 .....

Mycyk, MD Key Points Consider toxic alcohol poisoning in cases of an unexplained anion gap acidosis or an elevated osmol gap. Focus your initial treatment on the early inhibition of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) in cases of ethylene glycol or methanol poisoning to prevent the accumulation of toxic metabolites. INTRODUCTION With the exception of ethanol, no other alcohols are safe for human consumption and are therefore considered toxic alcohols. Ethylene glycol, methanol, and isopropanol are the most common toxic alcohols associated with human poisoning. Toxic alcohols are often ingested in 1 of 2 ways, either unintentionally if placed in an inappropri\u00ad ately labeled container, or intentionally by patients either attempting suicide or trying to become intoxicated when regular ethanol is not readily available. Of note, each of the 3 is capable of causing inebriation, with isopropanol being twice as intoxicating as ethanol. According to the National Poison Data System, more than 35,000 toxic alcohol exposures are reported to the American Association of Poison Control Centers yearly. Isopropanol is the most frequently ingested but causes the fewest number of deaths, whereas methanol is the least commonly ingested toxic alcohol but associated with the highest number of fatalities. Although the parent compound is responsible for inebriation, toxicity results from the metabolism of these compounds via alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) into toxic organic acid byproducts with consequent end organ injury. Ethylene glycol is metabolized to glycolic acid, glyoxylic Consult your local poison center (800-222-1222) or local toxicologist in all suspected cases for help initiating antidotal therapy and obtaining confirmatory toxic alcohol levels. Consult a nephrologist early to prepare for hemodialysis in cases involving large ingestions or severe metabolic acidosis. acid, and oxalic acid, all of which can produce systemic acidosis and acute kidney injury. Methanol is converted to formic acid which can produce systemic acidosis and retinal toxicity. Isopropanol is not converted to an organic acid but is rather metabolized into acetone, which can produce hemorrhagic gastritis and systemic hypotension in the absence of a concurrent acidosis. If either are unrecognized or untreated, all toxic alcohol ingestions can result in patient fatality. CLINICAL PRESENTATION ..... History Obtaining a history of toxic alcohol ingestion is often challenging. Patients may be obtunded on arrival to the emergency department (ED), not forthcoming with the ingestion history, or too young to be appropriately descriptive (children ). Reading the ingredient lists on the labels of any empty bottles found at the scene or brought to the ED can be extremely helpful. If a bottle or label is not available, ask the patient what kind of product was ingested. For example, antifreeze usually contains ethylene glycol, windshield-washing fluid usually contains metha\u00ad nol, and rubbing alcohol usually contains isopropanol. 235 CHAPTER 55 That said, remember that some products may contain dif\u00ad ferent types of toxic alcohols ( eg, some products contain methanol). Beyond attempting to iden\u00ad tify exactly what was ingested, it is critically important to determine the time of ingestion, as this will affect the interpretation of laboratory results and impact patient management priorities. ..... Physical Examination Most patients poisoned with a toxic alcohol will demonstrate some level of central nervous system (CNS) depression analogous to inebriation. Patients arriving soon after an ingestion may appear well with unremarka\u00ad ble physical exams, whereas those who arrive many hours after ingestion may be obtunded with unstable vital signs. Of note, the peak serum level of a toxic alcohol correlates poorly with the physical exam findings. As with all overdoses, perform a careful neurologic examination (mental status, cranial nerves, cerebellar findings, and motor strength). Ocular examination may reveal blurred vision, decreased visual acuity, retinal edema, optic atrophy, or hyperemia of the optic disc in methanol poisoning. Abdominal tenderness or blood on rectal examination may indicate isopropanol ingestion as it is classically associated with hemorrhagic gastritis. DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES ..... Laboratory A basic metabolic panel is indicated to determine renal function, acid-base status, and calculate an anion gap (the normal range is 8-12 mEq/L). Obtain an arterial blood gas to ascertain the degree of acidosis. A serum ethanol level is required in all cases of suspected toxic alcohol poisoning, as this result impacts the osmol gap equation and helps determine the timing of ADH inhibition. An osmol gap can be a useful screening test for toxic alcohol poisoning if calculated early after the ingestion. Send a serum sample to the laboratory to measure osmolality. The osmol gap is equal to this value minus the 0 s M 0 L A L I T y Time course calculated osmolality (2*Na + glucose/ 18 + blood urea nitrogen/2.8 + Traditiona lly a normal osmol gap is <10 mEq/L, but in actuality will normally range between -7 to + 14. It is the toxic alcohol parent com\u00ad pound that contribu tes to the osmol gap, and elevated gaps occur early after ingestion before the metabolism of the toxic alcohols into their poisonous byproducts. Later, as the toxic organic acid metabolites build up and the parent compound levels decrease, an anion gap metabolic acidosis becomes the predominant finding, with the osmol gap becoming less significant (Figure 55-1). Ethylene glycol and methanol can result in a simultane\u00ad ous anion gap metabolic acidosis and elevated osmol gap. Because isopropanol is not metabolized into an organic acid, ingestion typically results in an elevated osmol gap in the absence of an elevated anion gap. Because isopro\u00ad panol is rapidly converted to acetone, a serum acetone level can help identify isopropanol poisoning in this setting. Calcium oxalate crystals on urine microscopy or urine fluorescence under ultraviolet light (due to the addition of fluorescein to most commercial antifreeze) may be clues for ethylene glycol poisoning, but the absence of either should not be used to rule out exposure. Most importantly, serum toxic alcohol levels (quantitative ethylene glycol, methanol, and isopropanol) should be ordered STAT in cases of suspected toxic alcohol poisoning to confirm ingestion and guide management. It is important to recognize that toxic alcohol tests are rarely performed in hospital laboratories and must be sent to an off-site reference lab in most cases, so results may not be available for several hours. ..... Imaging Studies Although imaging studies do not help diagnose toxic alcohol poisoning, methanol exposure has been reported to cause basal ganglia hemorrhage or infarct. Computed tomo graphy imaging of the head should also be considered when the mental status does not cor\u00ad relate with the presumed exposure or associated trauma is a concern. A c I D E M I A .A. Figure 55-1. Relationship of degree of osmolality and acidosis during the course of ethylene glycol or methanol poisoning. Used with perm ission from Mark B. Mycyk, MD. TOXIC ALCOHOLS MEDICAL DECISION MAKING History alone may be sufficient to prompt a work-up for toxic alcohol poisoning. In the absence of a reported inges\u00ad tion, an unexplained anion gap acidosis or elevated osmol gap should prompt further evaluation for a toxic alcohol. Order STAT serum tests for all toxic alcohols (ethylene glycol, methanol, and isopropa nol). Initiate care based on the presumptive clinical diagnosis and do not delay ED treatment awaiting laboratory confirmation, as even in ideal scenarios these levels will often take several hours to measure. The initiation of antidotal therapy to inhibit ADH should be the management priority early after an ingestion before the onset of acidosis, whereas hemodialy\u00ad sis should be the priority in cases with a delayed presenta \u00ad tion when severe acidosis is already present (Figure 55 -2). TREATMENT Attention to the airway in cases of CNS depression should take precedence. IV fluids should be administered to treat hypotension and maintain renal perfusion in all cases of toxic alcohol poisoning. In cases of isopropanol ingestion, no additional treatment is necessary. In cases of ethylene glycol or methanol poisoning, initiate ADH inhibition until the ethylene glycol or methanol level is <20 mg/dL and no acidosis is present. ADH may be inhib\u00ad ited with either IV fomepizole (load = 15 mglkg) or an IV ethanol infusion (to achieve a serum ethanol level between 100-150 mg/dL). Obtain early nephrology consultation to facilitate emergent hemodialysis if the ethylene glycol or methanol level is >50 mg/dL to filter out the parent compound and any accumulated toxic metabolites. Emergent dialysis is also indicated in cases of renal failure or severe acidosis irrespect ive of the ethylene glycol or methanol level to remove any remaining toxic metabolites and improve the systemic acid-base status. In cases of ethylene glycol poisoning, both thiamine 10 mg IV and pyridoxine 50 mg IV every 6 hours may help convert glyoxylic acid to nontoxic metabolites. In cases of methanol poisoning, folic acid 50 mg IV every 4 hours may help convert for\u00ad mic acid to C02 and Hp. DISPOSITION .....

Acetaminop hen Toxicity Key Points Acetaminophen is the most popular over-the-counter analgesic in the United States and is widely pr escribed in combination form with alternative pain relievers, resulting in frequent unintentional is the most commonly used over\u00ad the-counter (OTC) analgesic in the United States. It is found in more than 100 combination pharmaceuticals (eg, cold and cough agents, sleep agents) and is present in multiple prescription opioid analgesics ( eg, Vicodin, Darvocet ). Toxic exposures to analgesics as a class have increased rapidly over the last decade. According to the National Poison Data System (NPDS) database of expo\u00ad sures reported to poison centers nationwide, there were 139,780 exposures to all APAP-containing products in the year 2010, with 1,142 cases exhibiting \"major\" effects and 125 fatalities. APAP toxicity is the most common cause of medication-induced liver failure in the United States and accounts for a significant portion of liver transplants. The maximum recommended safe dose is 4 g per day for adults and 60-90 mg/kg/day for children. Toxicity may result after an ingestion of 7 gin adults or 140 mg/kg in a child and is due to the conversion of APAP into toxic byproducts. APAP is normally metabolized via multiple pathways in healthy individuals. Sulfonation and glucuronidation are the two primary mechanisms and produce nontoxic metabolites that are cleared in the urine. Approximately 10-15%, though, is metabolized via the Jenny J. Lu, MD The Rumack-Matthe w nomogram should only be used in acute overdoses with reliable times of ingestion. Pay careful attention to all units of measurem ent. Consider early transfer to a liver transplant center for patients with worsening hepatic function or general signs of deterioration before they meet criteria for liver transplanta tion. cytochrome P450 uinoneimine (NAPQ I). After a endogenous stores of hepatic glutathione will rapidly detoxify any accumulating However, APAP overdose, the sulfona\u00ad tion and glucuronidation pathways are overwhelmed, and a greater percentage of APAP is metabolized via cytochrome P450 into NAPQI. Glutathione stores can become rapidly depleted, resulting in elevated levels of intrahepatic NAPQI with secondary toxicity. Furthermore, in overdose scenar\u00ad ios, a small percentage of APAP can be metabolized into NAPQI within the kidneys, resulting in consequent renal toxicity. Patients with lower glutathione stores (chronically ill, malnourished, and alcoholics) and those with upregu\u00ad lated cytochrome P450 activity (patients on certain medications including anticonvulsants and antituberculosis agents, chronic alcoholics) are more likely to suffer significant toxicity. Clinically, APAP poisoning progresses through 4 dis\u00ad tinct stages. Although all patients may not progress beyond the first stage after a toxic exposure, those that do tend to follow the following timeline. Stage 1 is generally encoun\u00ad tered within the first 24 hours postexposure. Symptoms of gastrointestinal ( GI) irritation predomi nate, including abdominal pain and vomiting, although patients may 239 CHAPTER 56 remain asymptomatic. Stage 2 occurs between 24-48 hours post exposure and is known as the latent stage. GI symp\u00ad toms resolve, but ongoing hepatotoxicity can lead to sig\u00ad nificantly elevating serum transaminases. The third stage occurs within 3-4 days after exposure. Abdominal symp\u00ad toms return, including pain and vomiting along with jaun\u00ad dice and potential encephalop athy. Laboratory studies may reveal acidemia, hypoglycemia, renal failure, and coagu\u00ad lopathy. Stage 4 lasts between 4 days and 2 weeks of the exposure and involves a progression to outright liver failure and death or complete patient recovery. The hepatic func\u00ad tion of those patients who survive APAP poisoning will also recover completely. CLINICAL PRESENTATION ..... History Always attempt to identify the exact formulation, amount, and timing of the ingestion. Ask about any coingestants (eg, ethanol) that might impact the metabolism of APAP and clarify the number and frequency of ingestions to rule out chronic toxicity. Ask about risk factors for increased toxicity, including chronically ill and alcoholic patients and those taking medications that activate the cytochrome P450 system (eg, anticonvulsants, antituberculosis ). The majority of symptoms are abdominal and neurologic in nature. Ask about the presence of any abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Inquire about any symptoms of altered mental status and decreased levels of consciousness, as these portent a more serious clinical course. ..... Physical Examination Pay careful attention to the patient's vital signs. Hemodynamic instability suggests a significant poisoning. Significant tachypnea may indicate an attempt to compensa te for an ongoing metabolic acidosis. Coingestions APAP + diphenh ydramine) marked abnormalities due to concurrent opioid or anticholinergic toxidromes. Note the patient's general appearance, mental status, and level of consciousness. Carefully examine the abdomen. Diffuse abdominal tenderness is common after significant overdose, and tender hepatome galy may be evident beginning in the latent stage. Finally, examine the skin and sclera, looking for signs of jaundice. DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES ..... Laboratory Obtain an immediate serum APAP level in all patients and follow with serial testing to establish an upward or downtrending value. In patients with clearly timed acute ingestions, order a second level at the 4-hour mark postexposure. These values can be plotted on the Rumack\u00ad Matthew nomogram to help determine treatment (Figure 56-1). Check a full panel of liver studies (a spartate aminotransf erase, alanine aminotransf erase, albumin, bilirubin) in all patients and follow serially, looking for evidence of worsening hepatotoxicity. Order a coagulation profile (prothrombin time [PT], international normalized ratio and partial thromboplastin time) to determine the degree of liver synthetic dysfunction. Check a baseline complete blood count and follow serial hemoglobin levels in patients who develop coagulopathies. Order a metabolic panel to assess for electrolyte abnormalities and to calculate the anion gap, as a significantly elevated anion gap metabolic acidosis may be present. Confirm the degree of acidosis with blood gas sampling. Finally, check the renal function in all patients, as acute kidney injury is common secondary to intra-renal NAPQI production. ..... Imaging Consider a head computed tomogra phy (CT) in patients whose mental status does not correlate with an isolated ingestion. Cerebral edema secondary to hyperammonemia may occur in hepatic failure. Abdominal CT imaging is usually of limited utility in APAP poisoning but should be considered in patients with signs of peritonitis. MEDICAL DECISION MAKING Many exposures and overdoses have the potential for significant hepatotoxicity. In most cases, a thorough history will be sufficient to identify APAP as the culprit. In patients presenting with elevated transaminases or signs of hepatic failure and no obvious source, there is usually little downside in empirically starting therapy with N -acetylcysteine (NAC) until more information is obtained. Draw baseline APAP and liver function tests and follow serially to determine whether the levels are rising or falling. In patients with acute ingestions of reliable timing, plot their 4-hour APAP level on the Rumack-Matthew nomogram to determine treatment. Of note, the nomogram cannot be used if either the time of ingestion is unknown or the ingestion is chronic (occurring over hours/day s). The nomogram may also be unreliable in cases of coingestions with products that alter APAP absorption and pharmacokinetics. Use the King's College liver transplant criteria early to estimate the severity of exposure and identify which patients may require transfer for specialty care. Patients with either a pH <7.3 after fluid resuscitation or a combi\u00ad nation of PT > 100, creatinine >3.3 mg!dL, and grade 3 or 4 encephalopathy are considered to meet these criteria. Consult your regional poison control center for all patients with significant hepatotoxicity to help determine the ideal treatment (Figure 56-2).

Gastric decontamination is occasion ally indicated and generally performed with activated charcoal (AC). AC readily absorbs APAP and should be given in cases with recent ingestions (within 8-12 hours of exposure) or those with evidence of ongoing absorption, provided there are no contraindicat ions. Give a starting dose of 1 g/kg and consider repeated dosing in patients with significantly large ingestions. Beware AC products containing sorbitol with repeated dosing to avoid significant fluid and electrolyte abnormalities. Gastric lavage and whole-bowel irrigation are rarely CHAPTER 56 .A. Figure 56-2.

NAC detoxifies NAPQI via multiple pathways, including functioning as a glutathione precursor. It is given orally in a loading dose of 140 mg/kg and subsequent doses of 70 mg/kg every 4 hours. NAC is adsorbed by charcoal, but there is no evidence that there is less effectiveness when NAC and charcoal are given together orally. Of note, oral NAC can be given by the intravenous (N) route if passed through a 0.22-micron filter, and multiple protocols exist taking advantage of this. There is also a Food and Drug Administration-approved IV NAC formulation, Acetadote, that doesn't require the use of a filter and has a lower likelihood of anaphylactoid reaction compared with giving the oral compound intravenousl y. N NAC can be used in all patients (including pregnancy) and is particularly useful in patients who cannot tolerate anything by mouth due to vomiting or altered mental status. Regardless of route, current guidelines recommend to continue NAC treatment until the liver function has normalized and APAP levels are undetectable. NAC therapy is generally indicated in 3 different patient cohorts. Start NAC in patients with (1) acute ingestions and 4-hour levels that lie above the nomogram cutoff, (2) in patients who report significant ingestions if obtaining a level will be significantly delayed, and (3) in those with evidence of hepatoxicity presumed secondary to APAP regardless of APAP level. ACETAMINOPHEN TOXICITY Seek early consultation with a liver transplant center if the patient shows any signs of deterioration ( eg, altered mental status, acidosis, worsening liver function). Ideally, the patient should be transferred before meeting liver transplantation criteria. DISPOSITION Admission Admit all patients who require treatment with NAC or demonstrate any signs of hepatotoxicity . Patients with hemodynamic instability, altered mental status, systemic acid-base derangements, and evidence of end-organ damage require admission to a critical care setting. Patients with intentional overdoses require psychiatric assessment. Discharge Patients with unintentional ingestions who exhibit no signs of hepatotoxicity and have downtrending serum APAP levels in the nontoxic range can be safely discharged home.

Aks, DO Key Points Salicylate toxicity causes a mixed respiratory alkalosis, metabolic alkalosis, and elevated anion gap metabolic acidosis. Chronically intoxicated patients will be more seriously ill at lower salicylate concentrations than their acutely poisoned counterpar ts. Pursue hemodialy sis in patients with refractory acidosis, pulmonary edema, renal insufficiency, and altered INTRODUCTION Analgesics are among the most common ly ingested substances in patient overdose. According to the National Poison Data System, there were more than 300,000 cases of analgesic overdose reported in the year 2009, with salicylates accounting for the 13th most common cause of isolated drug ingestion and 62 total fatalities. Aspirin is most often ingested in some form of aspirin-containing combination product such as over-the-counter cold remedies. It can also be found as a component in various prescribed combination products such as Fiorinal, Soma Compound, and Percodan. Methyl salicylate, the major component of oil of wintergreen, is commonly found as a rubefacient in various medical products such as Ben Gay and in multiple household items, including air fresheners and mouthwash. One teaspoon of 98o/o methyl salicylate can contain as much as 7 g of salicylate (>20 tablets of 325 mg aspirin). Aspirin absorption can be very erratic with peak concentrations occurring > 20 hours after ingestion. That said, levels obtained six hours after ingestion generally reveal evidence of toxicity. Salicylate metabolism follows Michaelis- Menten kinetics. At concentrations over 30 mg/dL, salicylates are metabolized by zero-order kinetics due to enzyme saturation. This means that a constant mental status or seizure, regardless of the actual serum salicylate level. Match the ventilation rate in intubated patients with severe salicylate poisoning to their pre-intubation minute ventilation, as most require remarkably high rates for adequate respiratory compensation. amount will be eliminated per unit of time. Below this concentration, salicylate metabolism follows first-order kinetics, with elimination rates proportional to serum salicylate concentrations. In overdose scenarios, salicylates induce a mixed acid\u00ad base disorder. They cause an initial respiratory alkalosis by directly stimulating the medullary respiratory center. In addition, excessive circulating salicylate induces lipolysis, inhibits the Krebs cycle, and uncouples oxidative phosphorylation. This process impairs normal cellular respiration, resulting in the accumulation of organic acids and a secondary elevation in the anion gap. Furthermore, volume depletion secondary to excessive vomiting can lead to a concurrent metabolic alkalosis. Therefore, the classic (although far from uniformly present) acid-base disorder with salicylate poisoning is a mixed respiratory alkalosis, metabolic alkalosis, and elevated anion gap metabolic acidosis. CLINICAL PRESENTATION History It is very important to determine the amount ingested and the timing of exposure. In addition, try to distinguish between acute, chronic, and acute on chronic ingestions. 244 SALICYLATE TOXICITY Patients with chronic intoxication often present with more subtle signs of toxicity. For example, elderly patients may present with isolated signs of altered mental status or tinni\u00ad tus. Conversely, acutely poisoned patients typically present with more dramatic findings, including nausea, vomiting, tachypnea, diaphoresis, and altered mental status. Attempt to identify the exact type of product ingested. Immediate\u00ad release aspirin will produce much more rapid symptom onsets and elevated salicylate concentrations compared to the enteric-coated variety. Patients who ingest combination products may exhibit toxic effects from the secondary agent ( eg, a concurrent opiate toxidrome from ingestion of a com\u00ad bined salicylate -opioid analgesic). Physical Examination Pay very careful attention to patient vital signs. Patients are frequently tachycardic due to significant volume loss. Tachypnea is common secondary to stimulation of the medullary respiratory center and as a compensation for the metabolic acidosis. Fever can occur as a result of uncou\u00ad piing of the oxidative phospho rylation chain. Finally, hypoxia may be present secondary to salicylate-induced acute lung injury (ALI). The remainder of the exam should focus on the skin, abdomen, and neurologic systems. Diaphoresis is an important sign in moderate to severe salicylate toxicity. Abdominal tenderness can be present because of the erosive effects of salicylate on the gastric mucosa. Patients may display alterations in their mental status. This can be a presenting sign in the chronically intoxicated patient or may accompany significant acute poisonings. Seizures may also be present in advanced cases. DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES Laboratory Obtain a complete blood count, chemistry panel, urinaly\u00ad sis, and bedside urinary pregnancy test. Calculate the anion gap and follow it serially. Order a serum blood gas to look for evidence of a mixed acid-base disorder. Check salicylate concentrations every 2 hours until a peak con\u00ad centration and subsequent decline has been observed, as pharmacobezoar formation is not uncommon with sec\u00ad ondary erratic absorption. It is also wise to obtain a serum acetaminophen concentration because of the prevalence of readily available combination analgesics and their high rates of use in patient overdoses. Imaging Imaging studies are generally unrewarding to detect ingested salicylates. A routine chest radiograph should be obtained to assess for ALI. PROCEDU RES Meticulous attention should be paid to the airway. The decision to intubate a patient in the face of salicylate over-dose is truly a life or death decision. Many patients with severe salicylate poisoning have very high minute ventila\u00ad tions exhibited by both an increased depth of respiration and a high respiratory rate. It is sometimes difficult, if not impossible, to mechanically reproduce a salicylate -poisoned patient's minute ventilation. If you are forced to intubate a salicylate -poisoned patient, the ventilator rate needs to be set very high to replicate the pre-intubation minute ventila\u00ad tion. Frequent post-intubation blood gases should be obtained to be sure that the pH does not drop. MEDICAL DECISION MAKING Always obtain a thorough history from the patient, family, and paramedics on what substances may be ingested. Determine whether the patient's presentation is consistent with an acute or chronic exposure. Be alert for the co-ingestion of alternative analgesics including aceta\u00ad minophen. Patients with the classic picture of salicylate poisoning may mimic the systemic inflammatory response syndrome, and one must consider alternative causes including sepsis. Obtain salicylate concentrations every 2 hours until a peak value has been obtained. In patients with salicylate levels <30 mgldL, follow until <20 mgldL and treat for patients with levels >30 mg/dL to facilitate urinary clearance and limit central nervous system penetration. One must observe vigilantly for any signs of clinical deterioration and initiate early hemodialysis, as this may be a life-saving intervention. Such findings include patients with altered mental status, seizures, severe acid-base derangements, pulmonary edema, and renal insufficienc y. Furthermore, patients with salicylate levels >90 mgldL after an acute ingestion and those with levels >60 mg/dL with chronic exposures warrant hemodia lysis. These thresholds should be lowered for patients with significant comorbidities (Figures 57-1). TREATMENT As with all poisonings, the initial focus should be on aggressive supporti ve care. Pay meticulous attention to the patient's airway, breathing, and circulation. Intubate patients only if absolutely necessary because of the difficulty in attaining the required minute ventilation with mechanical respiration. Because most patients are significantly dehydrated, initiate aggressive volume resuscitation with 1-2 L of normal saline to ensure an adequate urine output (1-2 rnL/kg/hr). There are several available modalities for patient decontamination. Administer activated charcoal at a dose of 1 g/kg to awake and alert patients with intact airway reflexes and no concern for vomiting. This can be repeated as needed to adsorb salicylates that form a concretion. Urinary alkalinization is performed by injecting 3 ampules of sodium bicarbonate into a 1-L bag of So/o dextrose solution to create an isotonic solution. Infuse this solution CHAPTER 57 Suspect significant salicylate ingestion or evidence of toxicity Address ABC's, decontaminate with activated charcoal at 1 gjkg with intact airway and bowel motility Figure 57-1. Salicylate toxicity diagnostic algorithm. at 200 mL/hr. Pay careful attention to potassium levels and replete as necessary, as hypokalemic patients will excrete hydrogen ions into the distal renal tubules to retain potassium, thereby impairing successful alkalinization of the urine. The goal of alkalinization is to raise the urine pH > 7 .S-8. Avoid alkalinization in patients with congestive heart failure and renal failure, as they will be unable to tolerate the necessary volume load. DISPOSITION Admission All symptomatic patients will require hospitalizati on. Patients who require urinary alkalinization or hemodia lysis should be admitted to a critical care setting. All patients with a suicidal ingestion will require psychiatric evaluation. Discharge Patients with a detectable serum salicylate level require serial testing to rule out continued absorption. An asymptomatic patient with an undetectable salicylate con\u00ad centration at the 6-hour mark can be safely cleared from a toxicologic perspective.

Dissanayake, MD Key Points Consider carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning in all patients with headache s, flu-like symptoms , altered mental status, or an unexplained anion gap metabolic acidosis. Immediately administer supplemental 02 to all patients with potential co poisoning before any confirmatory studies. Pulse oximetry values will be falsely elevated in patients with CO poisoning as a result of the inability of standard INTRODUCTION Carbon monoxide (CO) is an invisible killer; it is an odor\u00ad less, colorless, and nonirritating gas. It is generally encoun\u00ad tered as a byproduct of the incomplete combustion of carbon-based fuels (eg, coal, gasoline, natural gas). Faulty furnaces and vehicle exhaust fumes are common sources for clinical CO poisoning. Methylene chloride, a substance found in paint stripper and bubbling holiday lights, is metabolized in vivo into CO and may account for cases of delayed poisoning. According to 2010 US Poison Control Center data, more than 13,000 cases of possible CO poison\u00ad ing were reported. Approximately 5,000 of these cases were treated in medical facilities, and CO is the leading cause of toxin-related fatalities in children less than 5 years of age. In survivors of CO poisoning, it is not uncommon to develop delayed neurologic sequelae, including recurrent headaches, cognitive deficits, and motor disorders. CO exposure produces toxicity by 3 major pathways. The first of these is an inhibition of systemic 0 2 delivery. CO binds to hemoglobin (Hb) with an affinity roughly 240 times greater than 0 2 Systemic 0 2 delivery plummets as the majority of circulating Hb binding sites are now occupied by CO. In addition, Hb that has bound CO has an increased affinity for concurrently bound 02, resulting in oximetry to distinguish between oxyhemoglobin and carboxyhemoglobin. Symptomatology is often more important than the absolute carboxyhemoglobin level when determining treatment and disposition. the impaired release of 0 2 as it reaches the target tissues. This results in a leftward shift and altered shape of the oxy\u00ad hemoglobin dissociation curve (Figure 58-1). The ability of CO to inhibit normal cellular respiration accounts for its second mechanism of toxicity. CO binds to cytochrome aa3 and inhibits normal transit through the electron transport chain. The resulting shutdown in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway leads to a rapid deci\u00ad mation of stored ATP and secondary cellular death. The binding of CO to myoglobin accounts for the third mechanism of toxicity. Myoglobin binds to CO with an affinity 40 times that of 02, impairing the adequate deliv\u00ad ery of oxygen to muscle tissues. When myocardial cells are affected, a global reduction in cardiac contractility occurs. Of note, CO readily crosses the placenta and binds to fetal hemoglobin (HbF) with a 10-15% higher affinity than adult Hb, so fetal toxicity in cases of CO poisoning is often more severe than is evident on examination of the mother. CLINICAL PRESENTATION History The symptoms of CO poisoning are notoriously nonspe\u00ad cific, but typically present with some degree of neurologic and cardiovascular impairment.

Cardiovascular symptoms include ischemic chest pain, shortness of breath, and palpitations. Maintain a high index of suspicion in patients with vague symptomatology , especially in those with risk for CO exposure. Inquire about the location of presumed exposure and whether or not anyone else in the vicinity has developed symptoms. Ask about the presence of regularly maintained CO detectors in the house. High-risk scenarios for CO expo\u00ad sure include fire victims, patients in older houses with faulty furnaces during the winter time and/or those using alterna\u00ad tive forms of combustion to heat their homes, and patients in enclosed spaces with running automobiles. Finally, ask about the recent use of any paint stripper or solvents, as these compounds may contain methylene chloride. Physical Examination As with other poisonings, rapidly assess the patient's airway, breathing, and circulation. Take careful note of a full set of vital signs, keeping in mind that standard pulse oximetry is of minimal utility in this setting. Tachyp neic patients may be attempting to compensate for an underlying metabolic acidosis. Although patients with acute CO poisoning are classically described as having a \"cherry red\" appearance to their skin due to the bright red color of carboxyhemog lo\u00ad bin, this finding is absent far more often than present. Perform a detailed neurologic exam, looking for signs of altered mental status and loss of coordination, as neuro\u00ad logic findings often dictate final care. Perform an ocular exam, looking for signs of retinal flame hemorrhages. The cardiovascular exam should focus on signs of hemody\u00ad namic instability and dysrhythmia, which might indicate underlying myocardial ischemia. Carefully auscultate the lungs, noting any inspiratory crackles, which may be indicative of chemical injury to the lung parenchyma with secondary acute respiratory distress syndrome. Finally, check the skin for any signs of thermal injury in fire victims. Rarely, CO poisoning has been known to cause diffuse bullous lesion in the absence of thermal burns. DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES Laboratory Order an immediate COHb level on all patients to help confirm the diagnosis and estimate the severity of the exposure. COHb analysis requires co-oximetry of the blood sample and can be done on either a venous or arte\u00ad rial specimen . Of note, COHb levels correlate poorly with patient symptoms and should not be used in isolation to guide management. Check a metabolic panel looking for electrol yte abnormalities and to calculate the anion gap, as significant CO poisoning will result in an anion gap meta\u00ad bolic acidosis. Use the anion gap calculation along with a blood gas analysis to determine the severity of the acid\u00ad base derangement. Obtain a urine pregnancy on all females of childbearing age, as a positive pregnancy test will markedly impact man\u00ad agement. Check a serum lactate level. Significa ntly high levels (> 10 mmol!L) indicate severe cellular toxicity or concurrent cyanide poisoning. Order serum cardiac markers in all patients complaining of chest pain or with electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities, as myocardial ischemia has been reported, especially in patients with underlying coronary artery disease (CAD). Finally, check a creatine phosphokinase level in patients with unknown downtimes, as rhabdo myolysis is a serious concern. Electrocardiogram Obtain an ECG looking for signs of ischemia in patients complaining of chest pain, shortness of breath, and those with underlying CAD. Imaging Check a chest x-ray in patients with shortness of breath or a history of smoke inhalatio n, as chemical injury to the lungs with secondary pulmonary edema is common. Order a computed tomography ( CT) of the brain in patients with altered mental status or focal neurologic deficits to rule out alternative etiologies. Low-density lesions of the bilateral globus pallidi have been reported CARBON MONOXIDE POISONING with CO poisoning, and patients with abnormalities on CT imaging are more likely to exhibit chronic neurologic sequelae. MEDICAL DECISION MAKING CO poisoning presents similar to many other conditions, including migraine headaches, influenza- like illnesses, acute gastroenteritis, vasovagal syncope, and cerebrovascu\u00ad lar accident. Question patients about any possible expo\u00ad sures. Start supplemental 02 while obtaining confirmatory studies. Send co-oximetry to measure the COHb level in patients with concerning presentations and those with an unexplained high anion gap metabolic acidosis. Consider concurrent cyanide toxicity in the unconscious and hypo\u00ad tensive patient who was rescued from a house or industrial fire. Rapidly exclude pregnancy with bedside urine testing, as this will significant ly impact management. Use the abso\u00ad lute COHb in combination with the patient's symptoms to dictate further care including possible hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy (Figure 58-2). TREATMENT Treat concomitant injuries such as smoke inhalation, trauma, myocardial injury, seizures, or neurologic deficits as you would in any other setting. Supportive care in the form of airway management, oxygen therapy, and intravenous fluids remains the most important intervention. Normobaric 0 2 via a nonrebreather facemask should be administered until the COHb level is <5% and the patient is clinically stable. The circulating half-life of CO is approximately 4--6 hours in patients breathing room air, 90 minutes for those on 100% 02, and approximately 20 minutes for those undergoing HBO therapy. The absolute indications for HBO therapy are debat\u00ad able, but it is generally indicated for those patients with sig\u00ad nificant exposures (Table 58-1). The true benefit of treatment with HBO is most likely to limit the prevalence of delayed neurologic symptoms. The only absolute contraindication to HBO is an untreated pneumothorax. Because most hospitals do not have hyperbaric chambers, contacting your regional poison control center can be very helpful in the management and disposition of these patients. Check COHb level Neurologic abnormal ity, loss 02 therapy via non\u00ad rebreather, consult poison control center and/or transfer for HBO chamber No neurologic abnormality Discharge home after oxygen therapy and asymptomatic of conscious ness, coma, cardiovascular dysfunction, severe acidosis, pregnancy, intermittent exposure > 24 H Figure 58-2.

Nelson, MD Key Points Attempt to distinguish between acute versus chronic ingestions, as the symptoms and treatments differ. Electrocardiogram changes are common and include downward- sloping (scooped) ST-segment depressions, premature ventricular complexes, supraventricular dysrhythmias with slow ventricular rates, and bidirectional ventricular tachycardia. INTRODUCTION Digoxin, a commonly prescribed agent derived from the foxglove plant, belongs to a class of medications known as cardiac glycosides. These agents function to increase myo\u00ad cardial contractility and slow AV nodal conduction and are commonly used for the treatment of congestive heart failure and various cardiac dysrhyth mias including atrial fibrilla\u00ad tion. Of interest, cardiac glycosides are frequently encoun\u00ad tered in the natural world as a predatory deterrent in both plant and animal species, including oleander, lily of the valley, red squill, and bufo toads. The relative potency of digoxin lends to a very narrow therapeutic window, and life\u00ad threatening toxicity can develop with both acute overdoses and chronic excessive exposures. Poisoned patients generally present with variable symptoms and must be viewed in light of acute versus chronic versus acute on chronic exposures. If left untreated, death will invariably result secondary to car\u00ad diac instability and hemodynanlic compromise. As a whole, cardiac glycosides were responsible for nearly 2,500 poisonings reported to the National Poison Data System in the year 2010. They were the third most common cardiovascular agent implicated in patient toxic\u00ad ity and were the primary agent responsible for 17 patient deaths. Of note, clinically significant toxicity is far more 251 Although hyperkalemia can be a marker of significant digoxin poisoning, standard treatment with intravenous calcium should typically be avoided. Empirically administer digoxin-specific antibodies (5 vi\u00ad als for chronic toxicity, 10-20 vials for acute ingestions) to all patients with life-threatening dysrhythmias or hemodynamic instability. common in pediatric and geriatric populations. Pediatric overdoses arise from iatrogenic dosing errors or accidental ingestions of adult medications, whereas geriatric toxicity generally results from either drug-drug interactions or alterations in metabolic clearance. Intentional overdoses are most common in adult patients and can be of both the acute and chronic variety. Orally administered digoxin begins to exhibit clinical effects within 90 minutes of ingestion and typically reaches maximal effect within 4-6 hours. Digoxin is primarily eliminated by the kidneys with a usual half-life of 36-48 hours. Although normal therapeutic concentrations generally range between 0.5 and 2 ng/mL, given the significant toxicity and narrow therapeutic window, the safest suggested concentration with maximal therapeutic benefit is between 0.5 and 1 ng!mL. At the cellular level, digoxin inhibits the membrane\u00ad based sodium-pot assium pumps, causing an increase in intracellular sodium concentrations. This rise in intracellular sodium inhibits the membra ne-based sodium- calcium exchanger, causing a secondary elevation in intracellular calcium levels. The increased intracellular calcium concentration augments myocardial contractility and increases cardiac inotropy. It is this increase in cardiac inotropy that makes digoxin an attractive agent for the CHAPTER 59 management of congestive heart failure. Addition ally, digoxin increases the overall vagal tone of the heart and thereby decreases the electrical conduction velocity through both the SA and AV nodes. This property allows digoxin to be used as a rate-controlling agent in patients with supraventricular tachydysrhyth mias ( eg, atrial fibrillation). That said, this global slowing of myocardial signal conduction combined with a secondary shortening of the myocyte refractory period can potentially increase overall cardiac automaticity and excitability. Given these phenomena, toxic exposures typically present with a multitude of cardiovascular manifesta tions. CLINICAL PRESENTATION History Ascertaining the time of exposure is extremely important with potential digoxin toxicity. As with all potential poisonings, it is extremely important to determine the total amount ingested. Elucidate the number and frequency of exposures to distinguish between acute versus chronic versus acute on chronic toxicity. Carefully clarify the circumstances of the overdose to differentiate between accidental versus more insidious etiologies. Inquire about the presence of any gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, which typically accompany most acute overdoses. Central nervous system (CNS) effects include mood changes, headache, altered mental status, lethargy, and hallucinations. Visual disturbances are common and include blurry vision, photophobia, and chromatopsia (a change of color vision), in which visualized objects are classically surrounded by yellowish-green halos. Physical Examination Obtain a complete set of vital signs and carefully monitor for any evidence of hemodynamic instability. Although bradydysrhythrnias and systemic hypotension are most common, patients may present with any number of car\u00ad diac manifestations, including life-threatening tachycar\u00ad dias. Additional physical exam findings are variable and nonspecific and typically lag up to several hours after ingestion. CNS effects including confusion, generalized weakness, altered mental status, and lethargy may be present, and generalized seizures may accompany severe overdoses. DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES Laboratory Obtain a STAT metabolic panel as serum electrolytes play an extremely hyperkalemia (K+ >5.5 mEq/L) indicates significant toxic\u00ad ity with associated with increased fatality. Serum hypokalemia (K+ <3.5 mEq/L) is far more common with chronic toxicity and inhibits the function of the cellular sodium-potassium pumps, thereby increasing myocardial susceptibility to digoxin-related dysrhythrnias. Serum hypomagnesemia may further predispose to this increased cardiac toxicity. Finally, any decline in renal function will intensify toxicity, as digoxin is primarily eliminated via the kidneys. Obtain a serum digoxin level, as this will guide the dosing of digoxin Fab fragments. Therapeutic digoxin levels range from 0.5 to 2.0 ng/mL. Interpret the digoxin level carefully within the clinical context. The distributive phase of digoxin lasts for -6 hours after an ingestion, and serum levels obtained within this period may be falsely elevated. Electrocardiogram Obtain an emergent electrocardiogram (ECG) in all patients with potential digoxin toxicity. Prolongation of the PR interval and shortening of the QT segment are not uncommon with therapeutic digoxin concentrations. Upward \"scooping\" of the ST segment is also fairly common. These changes taken as a whole are referred to as the digitalis effect. In addition, excesses in intracellular calcium may produce frequent premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) and occasional U waves. Digoxin poisoning can induce nearly every form of dysrhythmia or conduction disturbance. Classic ECG fmdings include supraventricular tachydysrhy thmias (atrial flutter or fibrillation) combined with variable AV nodal blockade resulting in slow ventricular rates (Figure 59-1). Bidirectional ventricular tachycardia is nearly pathognomonic for serious digoxin toxicity. Additional ECG findings include sinus bradycardia, ventricular bigeminy, and ventricular fibrillation. PROCEDURES Cardioversion or defibrillation may be performed follow\u00ad ing Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support protocols in digoxin-poisoned patients exhibiting significant toxicity and unstable rhythms (ventricular tachycardia or .A Figure 59\u00b71.

MEDICAL DECISION MAKING The differential diagnosis of digoxin toxicity includes any disease process or toxin capable of inducing cardiac dysrhyth mias. Specific rhododendron, monkshood) . Medical conditions include underlying cardiac pathologies such as sick sinus syn\u00ad drome and AV nodal blocks as well as systemic conditions such as sepsis, myxedema coma, and adrenal crisis. The toxicologic differential of any hypotensive and/or bradycardic includes beta-bloc kers, calcium channel blockers, digoxin, and clonidine. Obtaining a thorough history frequently aids in establishing the appropriate diagnosis. The most common current presen\u00ad tation of digoxin toxicity is an elderly patient with an underlying cardiac history on multiple medications who experiences either significant drug-drug interactions or dehydration with secondary renal insufficiency and decreased digoxin clearance despite therapeutic usage. DIGOXIN The physical exam combined with appropria te ancillary testing is invaluable for identifying the correct toxidrome. Clonidine poisoning typically presents similar to an opioid toxidrome. A significantly elevated capillary blood glucose in a nondiabetic patient may indicate seri\u00ad ous calcium channel blocker toxicity. Taken in context of the history and physical exam, classic ECG findings and abnormal serum digoxin levels may be used to direct fur\u00ad ther treatment (Figure 59-2). TREATMENT After addressing and stabilizing the patient's airway, breathing, and circulation status, pursue gastrointestinal (GI) decontamination with activated charcoal (AC) for cases of acute overdose. Do not give AC to patients with depressed levels of consciousness without first securing the airway to prevent aspiration. Initiate volume resuscitation in dehydrated patients but be wary of those with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF). Treat severe hyperkale\u00ad mia in the standard fashion with sodium bicarbonate, albuterol nebulizers, glucose with insulin, and sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate ), but avoid empiric treatment with intravenous (IV) calcium due to the theoretical risk of \"stone heart\" and fatal dysrhythmias. That said, N calcium can be given to patients with severe Check serum digoxin level and electrolytes Consider 2} Elevated BP HR 59-2. Digoxin diagnostic algorithm.

In patients with chronic toxicity, carefully supplement serum hypoka\u00ad lemia and hypomagnesemia to prevent overcorrection. Treat significant and/or AV nodal conduction disturbances with IV atropine (0.5-2 mg). Digoxin-specific antibodies (Digibind, Digoxin Fab fragments) provide an eloquent and effective method for treating digoxin toxicity. Indications for use include signifi\u00ad cant dysrhythm ias, hypotension, and hyperkalemia second\u00ad ary to cardiac glycoside ingestion. Although no absolute contraindications exist, exercise caution in patients with a known hypersensitivity to ovine (sheep) derived products. The appropriate dose of Fab fragments can be determined by 1 of 3 ways and is based on the total body burden of digoxin. After an acute ingestion, digoxin has a roughly 80% bioavailability and each vial of Fab fragments can bind 0.5 mg of circulating digoxin. Based on this, the proper dose of Fab fragments can be calculated as follows: 1. Known quantity of ingested digoxin: Number of X 0.8)/0.5] patient weight (kg)]/100 Rounded-up to the nearest whole number 3. Patients demonstrating significant toxicity (life\u00ad threatening dysrhythmias, profound hypotension, and/ or acute ingestions with 10-20 vials of Fab fragments and chronic exposures with 5 vials. Repeated dosing may be required. Of note, most lab assays do not distinguish between free and bound digoxin, and serum levels lose their clinical util\u00ad ity after the administration of Fab fragments. Furthermore, treatment with Fab fragments may lead to the secondary decompensation of underlying cardiac conditions such as CHF or atrial fibrillation, which had been previously con\u00ad trolled with digoxin therapy. DISPOSITION Admission Admit all patients after a potentially significant ingestion who either have a history of significant comorbid conditions or exhibit signs or symptoms of clinical toxicity including cardiovascular instability, dysrhythmias, GI distress, and mental status changes. Any patient with toxicity significant enough to warrant digoxin Fab fragments requires admission to an intensive care unit setting. Patients who ingest digoxin as part of a suicide attempt warrant psychiatric evaluation once they are medically stabile. Discharge Patients with accidental ingestions and no significant comorbidities who remain symptom free after an 8- to 12-hour observation period may be safely discharged home.

Karydes, DO Key Points Cyclic antidepressants remain a leading cause of poisoning-related fatalities among psychoactive medications. Patients will frequently present with minimal signs and symptoms only to abruptly decompensate from life-threatening cardiovascular and central nervous system toxicity. INTRODUCTION Cyclic antidepressants (CA) consist of a group of pharma\u00ad cologically related medications that were initially developed in the late 1950s for the treatment of patients with severe depression. Although used less frequently for this purpose, their role has expanded to include the management of various alternative conditions including neuralgic pain, migraine headaches, enuresis, and attention deficit hyper\u00ad activity disorder. Traditional cyclic antidepressants have a chemical structure built on a 3-ring nucleus and include such medications such as amitriptyline, nortriptyline, dox\u00ad epin, imipramine, and clomipramine. a leading cause of pharmacologic self-poisoning owing to their near ubiquitous availability to a depressed patient population inherently at risk for self\u00ad harming behavior. Although the introduction of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRls) has decreased the overall incidence of CA poisonings, CA overdoses continue to account for a greater morbidity and mortality given their increased potential for significant toxicologic complica\u00ad tions, especially in pediatric patients. Cyclic antidepressants are nonselective agents that exhibit a wide array of pharmacologic effects with consid\u00ad erable variations in potency. The majority of clinical Cardiovascular toxicity (specifica lly refractory hypoten\u00ad sion) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in cyclic antidepressant overdose. Hypertonic sodium bicarbonate should be mEq/kg to reverse the wide-complex dysrhythmias commonly encountered with cyclic antidepressant poisoning. findings associated with CA poisoning can be attributed to ;:::1 of the following pharmacologic actions: Competitive inhibition of acetylcholine at central and peripheral (but not nicotinic) receptors Inhibition of a-adrenergic receptors Inhibition of norepinephrine and serotonin uptake Sodium channel blockade Antagonism of GABA-A receptors Although it is the inhibition of norepinephrine and serotonin uptake that is believed to account for the antide\u00ad pressant effects of these agents, the alternative actions just listed account for the significant toxicity associated with CA overdose, with sodium channel blockade being the most important factor contributing to patient mortality. CLINICAL PRESENTATION History Patients commonly present to the emergency department with minimal clinical findings only to develop life-threat\u00ad ening cardiovascular and central nervous system (CNS) manifestations within the timespan of a few hours. 255 CHAPTER 60 Co-ingestants are not uncommon in patients with CA overdoses, and this possibility must always be investigated. Attempt to determine the exact amount of drug ingested, as the cyclic antidepressants have a rather narrow therapeutic window, and small excursions beyond the usual therapeutic range (2-4 mg/kg) may result in signifi\u00ad cant toxicity. Acute ingestions of more than 10-20 mg/kg will cause significant cardiovascular and CNS disturbances owing to the blockade of cardiac sodium channels and inhibition of CNS GABA-A receptors, respectiv ely. Toxicity in children has been reported with ingestions as low as 5 mg/kg. Physical Examination The clinical presentation of CA toxicity varies widely from mild anti-muscarinic signs and symptoms to severe Table 60-1 Clinical manifestations of toxicity resulting from cyclic antidepressants. Cardiovascular Toxicity Conduction Delays PR interval, QTc interval, and QRS complex prolongation Terminal right access deviation (S in lead I and R in aVR) Atrioventricular block Dysrhythmias Sinus tachycardia Supraventricular tachycardia Wide\u00b7complex tachycardia Sinus tachycardia with rate\u00b7dependent aberrancy pointes Bradycardia Ventricular fibrillation Hypotension Central Nervous System Toxicity Altered mental status Delirium Psychosis Lethargy Coma Myoclonus Seizures Anticholinergic Toxicity Altered mental status Hyperthermia Urinary retention Paralytic ileus Pulmonary Toxicity Acute lung\u00b7injury aspiration Reprinted with permission from Flomenbaum N, Goldfrank L, Hoffman R, et al.

Anti\u00ad muscarinic findings are commonly appreciated in poi\u00ad soned patients, including dry skin and mucous membranes, diminished or absent bowel sounds, urinary retention, and sinus tachycardia. Acute cardiovascular toxicity must be recognized and treated expedient ly. Sinus tachycardia is a very common early finding, but typically does not result in hemodynamic compromise. That said, severe poisonings frequently progress to induce wide complex tachycardias and refractory hypotension. CNS toxicity can range from disorientation and agitation to outright lethargy. Early subtle alterations in levels of consciousness can quickly progress to obtundation and coma. Generalized tonic\u00ad clonic seizures occur in -4o/o of all patients who present with CA poisoning and in 13o/o of those who subsequently experience cardiopulmonary arrest. DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES Laboratory Although quantita tive assays for serum CA concentrations do exist, their limited availability and prolonged turn\u00ad around times preclude any clinical utility. Furthermore, serum levels correlate poorly with clinical significance. There are no additional laboratory studies useful for the diagnosis or management of patients with CA poisoning. Electrocardiogram The electrocardiogram (ECG) is the most useful and read\u00ad ily available modality for the evaluation of patients with potential CA poisoning. It not only provides rapid, distinc\u00ad tive, and diagnostic findings su ggestive of toxicity, but also facilitates the provision of targeted therapy. ECG abnor\u00ad malities develop within the first 6 hours of ingestion and typically resolve by 36-48 hours. The classic ECG pattern in moderate to severely poi\u00ad soned patients is sinus tachycardia with right axis devia\u00ad tion of the terminal 40 msec of the QRS complex (terminal R-wave in lead aVR) associated with prolongation of the PR, QRS, and QT intervals (Figure 60-1). Life-threatening complications are far more likely when the QRS complex is prolonged beyond 100 msec. Thirty percent of patients will experience seizures with a QRS > 100 msec, and the risk of ventricular tachycardia increases drastically when the QRS complex exceeds 160 msec. MEDICAL DECISION MAKING A high index of suspicion combined with a thorough his\u00ad tory, physical examination, and ECG analysis is required to establish the diagnosis of CA toxicity. Keep in mind that patients with intentional overdoses may neither be reliable nor forthcoming regarding their ingestions. Every effort must be made to ascertain the exact time of ingestion, specific agent and amount consumed, and the presence of CYCLIC ANTIDEPRESSANTS Cook Count y Hospital-ER Vent. rate PR interval QRS duration QT/QTc P-R-T axes 116 BPM 158 ms Age and gender specific ECG analysis Sinus tachycardia 108 ms Biatrial enlargement 336/467 ms 85 259 71 Right superior axis deviation No previous ECGs available ..-- r- - r- ,, \"' !Hi Ll I I I P- 'Y ....

Once identified, the treatment for CA toxicity should be initiated without delay (Figure 60-2). TREATMENT All patients require large-bore intravenous (IV) access and continuous cardiac monitorin g. Early intubation is recom\u00ad mended for patients with CNS depression and/or hemody\u00ad namic instability, as they have the potential for rapid deterioration. Furthermore, respiratory acidosis secondary to ventilatory insufficiency can exacerbate the cardiotoxic\u00ad ity CA poisoning. ...... Gastrointestinal Decontamination The induction of emesis with syrup of ipecac is no longer recommended given the potential for sudden decompensa\u00ad tion and secondary aspiration. Administer activated char\u00ad coal (1 g/kg) to all patients with intact airway reflexes as it will readily bind to and decrease the absorption of cyclic antidepressants. Orogastric lavage can be considered in symptomatic patients who present within an hour of ingestion after carefully weighing the benefits of removing a highly toxic drug against the inherent risks of the procedure. ...... Sodium Bicarbonate Therapy Because the cardiotoxicity of CA poisoning results from the blockade of myocardial Na+ channels, treatment with IV sodium bicarbonate (NaHC03) remains the mainstay of therapy. Sodium bicarbonate has been shown to improve electrical conduction and increase myocardial contractility. The indications for initiation of therapy are as follows: QRS complex > 100 msec (1 ampule of NaHC0 3 contains 50 mEq) and repeat as necessary until the patient improves or the serum pH reaches 7.5-7.55. After the initial stabilization, continue treatment with a NaHC0 3 infusion at a rate of 2-3 mL!kg/hr. ......

Norepinephrine (1 meg/min titrated to a max of 30 meg/min) is the agent of choice as it directly antagonizes the effects of cyclic antidepressants on the a-adrenergic receptors. ..... Seizures Most seizures occur within the first 3-4 hours after inges\u00ad tion. Seizures are typically brief and tonic-clonic in nature. Benzodiazepines such as diazepam or lorazepam are the initial treatment of choice. Seizures that are refractive to benzodiazepines require treatment with IV phenobarbital (15 mg!kg), although careful attention must be paid to the patient's hemodynamic status. Phenytoin should be avoided because it is ineffective in patients with CA poisoning and may actually exacerbate the cardiotoxicity of these agents. DISPOSITION ..... Admission Admit all symptomatic patients to a monitored setting. Those with signs of moderate to severe poisoning ( eg, lethargy, hypotension, prolonged QRS duration) and all patients who require treatment with IV NaHCO 3 require admission to an intensive care unit.

Discharge Patients who remain symptom-free throughout an observa\u00ad tion period of no less than 6 hours may be safely discharged home provided they are cleared from a psychiatric perspective .

Cudnik, MD Key Points Intoxication with either alcohol or drugs is very com\u00ad mon in patients with hypothermia. Most emergency thermome ters cannot accurately read body temperatures below 34.4\u00b0( (94\u00b0F). Many hypothermic patients have serious underlying illnesses that help contribute to their presentation, INTRODUCTION Clinical hypothermia is defined as a core body temperature of less than 35\u00b0C (95\u00b0F) and can be clinically stratified by the core temperature into mild (35\u00b0-32\u00b0C/95\u00b0- 89.6\u00b0F), moderate (32\u00b0-30\u00b0C/89. S0-86\u00b0F), and severe ( <30\u00b0C/86\u00b0F) subtypes. Hypothermia occurs as the body loses heat from 1 of 4 major mechanisms: conduction, convection, evaporation, and radi\u00ad ation. Convective (windy environments) and conductive (cold and wet exposures) mechanisms are responsible for most cases of accidental hypothermia. Hypothermia can be further classified as either primary or secondary. Primary hypothermia occurs when an otherwise healthy person is unable to compensate for an excessive exposure to cold tem\u00ad peratures. Secondary hypothermia occurs when a comorbid medical hypothyroidism, sepsis, intoxication) disrupts a patient's normal thermoregulatory processes. Although most common in colder climates, hypother\u00ad mia can occur in any environment. Case reports during summer months and in hospitalized patients are not uncomm on. In the United States, hypothermia is respon\u00ad sible for approximately 700 deaths annually, with more than half occurring in patients older than 65 years. Patients with an initial core body temperature <23\u00b0C (73.4\u00b0) typi\u00ad cally do not survive, and the overall mortality rate of patients with hypothermia is approximately 40%. and it is imperative to aggressively identify and treat these conditions. Resuscitative efforts should not be terminated until defibrillation remains unsuccessful despite a rewarmed core body temperature of at least 32\u00b0C. CLINICAL PRESENTATION ..... History The potential for hypothermia is usually obvious in patients with significant exposures. Patients may present in wet clothing, be found outdoors in the cold weather, or be inappropria tely dressed for the environment in which they live. In the United States, most hypothermic patients are either intoxicated or suffer from an underlying psychiatric illness or dementia. The history or presentation may be less obvious for patients with mild hypothermia or unknown exposures. Said patients typically present with nonspecific neurologic findings, including dizziness, confusion, slurred speech, or ataxia. Patients with severe hyperthermia may present comatose or in cardiac arrest. ..... Physical Examination As with all emergency department (ED) patients, start by assessing and addressing the patient's airway, breathing, and circulation (ABCs) and vital signs. Hypothermic patients may present with unstable airways or absent pulses. Carefully measure the patient's core body tempera\u00ad ture by inserting a specialized \"low-reading\" probe into the bladder, rectum, or esophagus as this will be pivotal to 259 CHAPTER 61 establish the diagnosis. Keep in mind that the majority of standard ED thermometers will not record temperatures below 34.4\u00b0C (94\u00b0F). Physical exam findings frequently vary based on the degree of hypothermia. It is imperative to immediately and completely undress the patient to remove any wet clothing and identify any signs of coexisting frostbite, trauma, sepsis, hypothyro idism, adrenal crisis, toxidromes, or cardiac dys\u00ad function. Refrain from any unnecessary movement of the patient to avoid precipitating life-threatening dysrhyth\u00ad mias, as hypothermic myocardium is exceptionally irritable. Finally, perform a comprehensive neurologic exam includ\u00ad ing an evaluation for level of consciousness, pupillary reactivity, and focal deficits. The following describes find\u00ad ings specific to varying degrees of hypothermia. Mild Hypothermia Patients tend to present with shivering, tachycardia, tachy\u00ad pnea, and hyperventilati on. As their core temperature approaches 33\u00b0C (91.4\u00b0F), ataxia and apathy begin to develop. Moderate with moderate hypothermia develop hypoventi la\u00ad tion, hyporeflexia, and an altered sensorium or stupor. Shivering typically disappears once the core temperature drops below 32\u00b0C (89.6\u00b0F), and this should be considered an ominous finding. As the temperature approaches 30\u00b0C (86\u00b0F), the risk for dysrhythrnias increases significantly. Severe Hypothermia Patients with severe hypothermia with pul\u00ad monary edema, areflexia, hypotension, and apnea and are extremely susceptible to ventricular fibrillation and cardiac arrest. Nearly all patients with a core body temperature below 27\u00b0C (80.6\u00b0F) are comatose. DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES Laboratory Obtain a STAT bedside glucose level on all hypothermic patients to rule out concurrent hypoglycemia. Serum hyperglycemia is actually more common secondary to a cold-induced inhibition of insulin secretion. Avoid treat\u00ad ment with supplemental insulin in these patients, as this may precipitate iatrogenic hypoglycemia on rewarming. Check a metabolic panel to assess electrolyte status and renal function. Hypothermia can impair the concentrating ability of the renal tubules, leading to a \"cold-diuresis\" with secondary dehydration and hypovolemia. Hypothermia impairs both platelet aggregation and the coagulation cascade, and patients may become profoundly coagulopathic. In spite of this, the laboratory measurement of the prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time will be normal as blood samples are warmed to physiologic temperatures before running these tests. In addition, hypothermia classically induces hemoconcentration with an expected increase of the hematocrit by 2% for every 1 \u00b0C drop in core temperature. Electrocardiogram An electrocardiogram is critical for all moderately to severely hypothermic patients to assess for potentially life\u00ad threatening cardiac dysrhyth mias. Sinus bradycardia and QT prolongation are the most common early findings. Although not specific for hypothermia, Osborn J waves, wide positive deflections at the junction of the QRS com\u00ad plex and ST segment, can be seen once the core tempera\u00ad ture drops below 32\u00b0C (89.6\u00b0F) (Figure worsens, atrial fibrillation and eventually ventricular fibrillation often develop. Imaging Imaging studies should be dictated by the clinical presentation. Obtain a head computed tomography in patients who exhibit persistent alterations in mental status despite adequate rewarming and in those with any signs of cranial trauma. MEDICAL DECISION MAKING The history and physical examination, coupled with a known environmental exposure, are typically adequate to establish the diagnosis of hypothermia. The absence of a known environmental exposure or any concern for secondary hypothermia should prompt an active search for potential etiologies. That said, treatment should not be delayed while awaiting the diagnostic work -up (Figure 61-2). TREATMENT Passive rewarming is typically adequate for patients with mild hypothermia (35\u00b0-32\u00b0C). This technique uses the body's inherent heat production mechanisms to restore a normal core temperature. To be successful, the patient needs an intact shivering response and sufficient energy stores. Remove any wet clothing and wrap the patient in warm blankets. Passive rewarming usually raises the core temperature by < 1 \u00b0C per hour. Most patients with moderate hypothermia (32\u00b0-30\u00b0C) require active external rewarming. This includes the infu\u00ad sion of intravenous (N) fluids warmed to 42\u00b0C, administer\u00ad ing humidified supplemental 0 2 warmed to 46\u00b0C, the placement of forced-air rewarming blankets (eg, Bair Hugger). Taken as a whole, these methods can rewarm patients at a rate of approximately 3.SOC per hour. These measures are usually adequate for patients with severe hypo\u00ad thermia ( <30\u00b0C) as well, provided they exhibit no evidence of cardiac instability. Those who do demonstrate signs of myo\u00ad cardial instability and/or cardiac arrest require active core rewarming. Available modalities include warmed isotonic saline n: ......._.,.___,f-_.; f Figure 61-1. ECG demonstrating Osborn J waves (arrow) in a hypothermic patient.

Hypothermia diagnostic algorithm. CHAPTER 61 bladder, and colon. Peritoneal and pleural irrigation can also be performed after the insertion of percutaneous catheters. Emergent thoracotomy with internal cardiac massage and mediastinal irrigation with warmed saline is a very invasive technique, but has been used successfully in severely hypothermic patients with prolonged cardiac arrest. When available, extracorporeal rewarming with cardiopulmonary bypass remains the most rapid way (>9\u00b0C/hr) to rewarm a patient with severe symptomatic hypothermia. Patients with ventricular fibrillation and core tempera\u00ad tures <30\u00b0C are often resistant to defibrillation. If the initial attempt at defibrillation is unsuccessful, begin cardiopulmo\u00ad nary resuscitation and actively rewarm the patient to at least 30\u00b0C before reattempting. Standard Advance Cardiac Life Support medications (eg, atropine, lidocaine, arniodarone) are typically ineffective for the management of hypothermia\u00ad induced dysrhythrnias. Remember that a patient should not be pronounced dead until first rewarmed to 32\u00b0C. DISPOSITION Admission Most patients with moderate and severe hypothermia require hospital admission for active rewarming and con\u00ad tinued investigation into the etiology of hypothermia if not clearly environmental. Admit all patients with evidence of cardiac instability and those undergoing active core rewarming to an intensive care unit setting. Discharge Patients without serious comorbidities who present with mild to moderate hypothermia and successfully undergo passive rewarming can be safely discharged, provided there is a warm environment for them to go. To prevent recur\u00ad rent cold exposure, obtain social work consultation to arrange placement for undomiciled patients and admit to the hospital if unsuccessful. SUGGESTED READING Bessen HA.

Stehman, MD Key Points Address hypothermia, dehydration, and any alterna\u00ad tive life threats before focusing on cold-induced tissue injuries. When in doubt, treat all cold-induced tissue injuries as frostbite. INTRODUCTION Previously the domain of military physicians, the prevalence of cold-induced tissue injuries in the civilian population has increased substantially over the past 20 years as a result of the growth of homelessness and an expanding interest in cold weather outdoor activities such as skiing and mountain climbing. Cold-induced tissue injuries are typically divided into 2 categories: nonfreezing cold injuries (NFCI) and frostnip, chilblains/ pernio, and immersion/trench foot. Of the 2 types of injury, frostbite is the more devastating and requires more aggres\u00ad sive treatment. That said, chilblains and immersion foot can also progress to significant disability and require prompt recognition and intervention. Although individuals at the extremes of age are at a higher risk for cold-induced tissue injuries, frostbite is fairly uncommon in these cohorts. In fact, adults aged 30-49 are the most likely group to suffer frostbite. The hands and feet account for more than 90% of all reported frostbite injuries, whereas almost all NFCis involve the feet. Other areas of the body at risk for cold-induced tissue injury include the face (eg, nose, ears), buttocks and perineum, and penis. There are 3 major categories of risk factors for cold\u00ad induced tissue injury. Behavioral risk factors include Rewarm frostbitten extremities rapidly in a warm water bath (4D-42\u00b0C) and nonfreezing injuries slowly in a dry environment. Do not discharge patients with cold-induced tissue injuries without first ensuring they have a warm, dry place to go. homelessness, inadequate clothing or shelter, alcohol or drug use/intoxication, and psychiatric illness. Physiologic risk factors include comorbid diseases that impair distal circulation the use of vasoconstric \u00ad medications, and external conditions such as high alti\u00ad tude exposure. Mechanical risk factors compose the final category and are the most easily correctable. Common examples include constrictive clothing and jewelry, prolonged contact with heat conductive materials, and immobility. Of the 3 types of NFCI, frostnip is the least severe. It typically affects the distal extremities after prolonged exposure to cold but nonfreezing temperatures. Ice crystal formation and profound vasoconstriction are common in the superficial tissues, and patients frequently complain of a dull throbbing pain during rewarming. Essentially a precursor to frostbite, overt tissue destruction is lacking. Chilblains (pernio) involve the formation of inflamm a\u00ad tory skin lesions after repeated intermittent exposure to a nonfreezing but cold and wet environment. Although chilblains can affect any area of the body, the face, dorsal surfaces of the hands and feet, and pretibial tissues are the most common ly involved. Permanent tissue damage secondary to vascular inflammation and tissue bed hypoxia may develop. Women, children, and patients with underlying vasculitides are most commonly affected. 263 CHAPTER 62 Immersion foot develops after the prolonged exposure to persistently wet conditions, both warm and cold, although the latter typically results in more severe tissue injury. The long-term exposure to moisture induces tissue edema and inflammat ion, whereas the prolonged cold exposure leads to direct tissue injury . The consequent ly encountered vasospasm, intravascular thrombosis, and neuronal destruction can lead to full-thickness tissue loss. Immersion foot is most commonly seen in the homeless population. Frostbite involves the freezing of tissues and can result in significant tissue loss and long-term disability. Ice crystal formation within the extracellular space can induce intracellular vasospasm and intraluminal thrombosis the severity of tissue loss. Circulat ing tissue inflamma tory markers frequently exacerbate the intensity of tissue injury and complica te the reperfusion of warmed tissue. CLINICAL PRESENTATION History Taking an adequate history should never delay the removal of a patient from a cold environment. Inquire about previous medical or psychiatric illnesses, drug and alcohol use, and housing status. Any history of trauma should be documented. Try to identify the overall duration of cold exposure and elicit any previous history of frostbite or a thawing and refreezing pattern of tissue injury. The review of symptoms should attempt to discover the presence of altered sensitivity, numbness, or burning pain. Frostnip generally presents with numbness, pain, pallor, and paresthesias of the ears, nose, fmgers, and toes. Patients with chilblains typically present with complaints of erythema, edema, and an intense pruritus or burning sensation. Immersion foot is usually associated with significant pain and swelling and occasionally numbness and/or the inability to ambulate. Frostbitten patients generally complain of the inability to feel the affected areas. Physical Examination Remove all clothing and thoroughly examine the entire body, focusing primarily on the face, hands, lower legs and feet, and buttocks and genitalia. Patients with frostnip may present with paleness of the affected areas, but a normal exam does not rule out injury. Chilblains frequently present with erythema and edema and occasiona lly with vesicles, bullae, and even ulcerations. The characteristic lesions are purple or bluish in hue and appear 12-24 hours after expo\u00ad sure. Extremities affected by immersion foot will be swollen and erythemato us. Tissue sloughing is common, and there may be an associated malodor. Frostbite typically presents with mottled or violaceous tissue that may have a waxy Figure 62-1. Deep frostbite of the toes. .A. Figure 62-2. Superficial frostbite. Note the tissue edema and clear blisters. appearance. Although frostbite can be classified similar to burns into superficial and deep tissue injuries, this distinction often cannot be made until the tissue is properly rewarmed. Secondary blister formation is common, with the early for\u00ad mation of large clear blisters generally imparting a better prognosis than the delayed development of smaller hemor\u00ad rhagic bullae (Figures 62-1 and 62-2). Significant tissue necrosis can complicate cases of deep tissue freezing despite minimal initial physical exam findings. DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES Diagnostic studies of any kind are of limited utility in the initial evaluation of patients with cold inducted tissue injuries. That said, pursue radiographic and laboratory studies as dictated for the evaluation of concurrent medical COLD-INDUCED TISSUE INJURIES illness or traumatic injury. Radionuclide bone scanning and magnetic resonance imaging may a prognostic role in long-term management. MEDICAL DECISION MAKING Include cold-induced tissue injuries in the differential diag\u00ad nosis of all patients exposed to freezing or near freezing temperatures, but evaluate and treat for any life-threatening conditions before dealing with these injuries. Check the core body temperature of all cold exposed patients to rule out hypothermia. Investigate for and address any concurrent trauma or dehydrati on. Attempt to delineate between freez\u00ad ing and nonfreezing injuries, as the treatments will differ. If unclear between the two, always err on the side of frostbite and treat accordin gly. Consider compartment syndrome in frostbitten regions if the swelling does not resolve and pulses do not return after adequate rewarming. Keep in mind that other injuries or illnesses can both mimic and contribu te to cold-induced tissue injury. For example, the erythema of rewarmed frostnip and immersion foot can resemble cellulitis or deeper tissue infections. Peripheral vascular disease and vasculitides not only appear similar to both frostbite and chilblains but also increase their likelihood secondary to impaired microvas\u00ad cular circulation. Finally, the color changes and blisters of frostbite can be confused with both stasis dermatitis and autoimmune bullous forming conditions (Figure 62-3). Address hypothermia, dehydration and life threats Ambient rewarming Figure 62-3. Cold-induced tissue injuries diagnostic algorithm. TREATMENT All clothing should be removed and replaced with warm blankets. Wet clothing is especia lly problematic as it will continue to cool the patient during treatment. Dehydration is a common complicating condition and requires aggressive volume resuscitation with intravenous (IV) crystalloids to lessen blood hyperviscos ity. All body parts that have suffered cold-induced tissue injury will need some type of rewarming, with the pattern of injury sustained determining the appropriate modality. Frostnip usually resolves spontaneo usly with dry rewarming measures at room temperatures and requires no further intervention. Rewarm chilblains affected skin at room temperature and then wash, dry, and dress in a soft sterile bandage. Initiate pain control as needed and elevate the affected extremity to prevent excessive edema formation, as this will predispose to subsequent infection. Patients with recurrent episodes may benefit from treatment with oral nifedipine (30-60 mg/day), and top ical and systemic corticosteroids have both shown promise in certain patient cohorts. Immersion foot requires slightly more detailed care. Rewarm affected tissues at room temperature and allow them to air dry. Restrict patients to bed rest and elevate the affected extremities during the rewarming period. Certain patients may achieve adequate pain relief with oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, whereas others may require parental opioid analgesia. The early use of tricyclic antidepressants may help limit the future development of chronic neuropathic pain. Extreme cases of immersion foot may be indistinguishable from frostbite and should be treated as the latter until proven otherwise. Finally, all patients with NFCI require clear instructions to limit their potential for recurrent exposure and injury. Frostbite requires more aggressive treatment to limit progressive tissue damage. Rewarm all affected areas in a warm water recirculating bath ( 40-42\u00b0C) with a mild povidone -iodine or chlorhex\u00ad idine). Do not use water warmed above 42\u00b0C to avoid superimposed thermal injury. Never initiate rewarming in the prehospital setting if there is any potential for refreezing, as this can worsen tissue injury. A rewarming period of between 15 and 60 minutes is adequate for most patients. Use the appearance of the affected tissues to guide the duration of therapy. Appropria tely rewarmed tissue should appear erythematous and pliable. Encourage active movement of the affected extremity to stimulate increased circulation. Rewarming can be exception\u00ad ally painful, and parental opioids are frequently required. Numerous adjunctive therapies have been proposed, although the evidence supporting their use is lacking (Table 62-1). It may take many weeks for the full extent of the patient's injuries to declare. That said, certain early findings do suggest better or worse outcomes. Findings associated with a better prognosis include the rapid re-establishment of normal skin tempera ture and sensation and the CHAPTER 62 Table 62-1. Adjunctive therapies for frostbite. Debride clear blisters. Leave hemorrhagic blisters intact. Apply aloe vera cream (Dermaide) every 6 hours to affected tissue. Dress affected areas in soft, dry bandages.

Admit to hospital for daily hydrotherapy at 40\u00b0C. Strictly prohibit smoking. development of large clear blisters. Persistent tissue cyanosis, firm insensate skin, and the delayed formation of small hemorrhagic blisters all portent a poor prognosis. DISPOSITION Admission Admit all patients with acute frostbite for a minimum of 24-48 hours, as the full extent of tissue injury may not be evident on initial presentation. Transfer to a specialized burn center may be required in severe cases where significant tissue necrosis will necessitate surgical debridement. Consider admission for all high-risk patients (young children, elderly, and homeless) with NFCI and most patients with significant immersion foot to limit further progression of disease. Discharge Most patients with frostnip, chilblains, and mild cases of immersion foot can be safely discharged home provided they have access to adequate cold-weather clothing and a warm, dry environment. All discharged patients require clear instructions on proper wound care and further injury prevention. Ensure adequate outpatient analgesia and arrange for close surgical follow-up as necessary.

Heat-Related Illness Natalie Radford, MD Key Points Always consider secondary causes of hyperthermia. Heat exhaustion and heat stroke should be diagnoses of exclusion. Do not fluid overload elderly patients while rehydrating them in the emergency department (ED). Remember that their fluid and electrolyte deficits developed over INTRODUCTION Heat exhaustion and heat stroke are on a continuum of dis\u00ad ease severity. Heat exhaustion occurs when the body can no longer dissipate heat adequately, resulting in hyperthermia. Heat stroke is the result of complete thermoregulatory dys\u00ad function. Classic heat injury occurs in the elderly or ill with prolonged exposure to high environmental temperatures. Physical exertion is not required. Elevated temperatures and high humidity overwhelm the body's normal cooling mecha\u00ad nisms. Ex:ertional heat injury occurs in physically fit individ - uals who exert themselves during conditions with high heat and humidity. Heat gain from the environment combined with internal heat production overwhelms the body's normal cooling mechanisms, creating hyperthermia. There are about 400 deaths from heat-related illness in the United States every year. Extremes in weather condi\u00ad tions can greatly affect these numbers. The Midwest heat wave in July 1995 caused 465 deaths in the city of Chicago alone. The mortality rate in patients with heat stroke can range between 10% and 70% and is affected by a patient's physical ability to adapt to changes in the ambient tern\u00ad perature and medical comorbidities. The body normally maintains its core temperature between 36\u00b0C (96.8\u00b0F) and 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F). In hyperthermia, as opposed to fever, there is an elevated body temperature without a resetting of the hypothalamic temperature center. days, and they do not need to be fully repleted while in the ED. Begin cooling the severely hyperthermic patient as soon as other life-threatening conditions and airway, breathing, and circulation have been addressed. Delays in treatment can increase morbidity and mortality. The body reacts to a heat stress to decrease body temperature via 3 main mechanisms: increased sweat production, decreased internal heat production, and removal from the hot environment. Any factors that impede these responses can lead to heat exhaustion or heat stroke. Evaporation of sweat is the main mechanism through which the body dissipates heat. Evaporative mechanisms are impaired by both environmental and physical factors. High humidity, as seen with an elevated heat index, impedes the body's ability to evaporate sweat and cool. Elderly, infants, and those with chronic illness have decreased ability to adapt to hot conditions. Certain medi\u00ad cations including antipsychotics, anticholinergics, beta\u00ad blockers, and diuretics also interfere with sweat evaporation and cooling. Alcoholics, those with decreased mobility, and some patients with chronic medical conditions including obesity, poor cardiac function, and scleroderma have impaired abilities to evaporate heat as well. Radiation, conduction, and convection of heat also allow the body to lose heat, but only when the ambient temperature is lower than body temperature. Utilizing these mechanisms can aid in cooling a hyperthermic patient. CLINICAL PRESENTATION In patients presenting with heat exhaustion, core body tem\u00ad perature is usually normal, but can be elevated to 40\u00b0C 267 CHAPTER 63 (104\u00b0F). Patients complain of nonspecific symptoms and signs including weakness, dizziness, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, headache, myalgias, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotension, and diaphoresis. By definition, mental status remains normal. Heat stroke patients present with altered mental status (AMS) ranging from mild confusion to coma. Body temperature is elevated above 40\u00b0C (104\u00b0F), and they may or may not be sweating. Patients can exhibit a wide range of neurologic symptoms and signs, including ataxia, seizures, and hemiple - gia. Multiorgan system failure consisting of hepatic, renal, and cardiac impairment may also be present in severe cases . ..... History Important factors to address in the history include a full description of the circumstances surrounding the heat exposure. Has the patient been in a non-air-conditioned apartment in the summer for several days, or has the patient been working outside while there is an elevated heat index? Past medical history should include questioning for medical conditions that increase the risk of heat illness and medications that impede the body's ability to cool. ..... Physical Examination Physical examination should involve complete exposure of the patient to remove heat-trapping clothing and to assess for any physical injuries. DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES ..... Laboratory A complete metabolic panel (CMP) should be drawn to evaluate serum electrolytes. Hypo-or hypernatremia may be present as well as hyperkalemia. Prerenal azotemia may also be seen on the CMP, indicating impaired renal function. A creatine phosphokinase should be checked to rule out rhab\u00ad domyolysis. As end-organ damage occurs, patients with heat stroke may develop elevated liver enzymes (peaking at 24-72 hr), disseminated intravascular tomography (CT) scan of the brain should be performed on patients presenting with AMS. In heat stroke, the CT is normal. Electrocardiogram should be performed on all patients with heat exhaustion and heat stroke to evaluate for signs of ischemia or electro\u00ad lyte abnormalities. MEDICAL DECISION MAKING When a patient presents with a potential heat-related ill\u00ad ness, first priorities include airway, breathing, and circula\u00ad tion (ABCs) and vital signs with temperature (Figure 63-1). Eliminating other causes for the patient's symptoms is also important. Differential diagnosis should include meningi \u00ad tis, sepsis, thyroid storm, drug intoxication (PCP, amphet\u00ad amines, cocaine), cerebral hemorrhage, and status epilepticus. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome and sero\u00ad tonin syndrome should both be considered in any patient taking psychiatric medications. Malignant hyperthermia, although usually occurring in the context of inhalational anesthetic or succinylcholine use, should be considered if symptoms develop in a patient with a previous or family history of this conditio n. Vigorous exercise may precipitate this condition in susceptible individuals. TREATMENT Once other diagnoses are excluded, heat exhaustion is the presumed diagnosis if the patient has normal mental sta\u00ad tus. Rehydration with either oral or intravenous (N) fluids is appropriate. Consider oral volume replacement with an electrolyte-containing solution if the symptoms are mild. If there is any concern for potential complications from comorbid conditions, N therapy and laboratory studies should be instituted. In both cases, treat the patient with ambient cooling, removal of heavy clothing, and rest . After eliminating other potential differential diagnoses, the diagnosis of heat stroke can be made when the patient with suspected heat illness has an elevated temperature (>40\u00b0C or 104\u00b0F) and AMS. Begin treatment immedia tely with N volume and electrolyte replacement. Start with 250-500 mL of normal saline and replace other electrolytes based on laboratory values. Be careful not to fluid-overload older patients or those with cardiac problems . Evaporative cooling should begin as soon as all life threats have been assessed and ABCs are secure. Completely expose the patient and mist with tepid water while a fan is blowing on him or her. Specially made cool mist fans are highly effective, but not available in most facilities. Alternatively, a spray bottle and a box fan are sufficient to lower the patient's temperature. The patient's core body temperature must be monitored fre\u00ad quently. A Foley catheter device that provides continuous temperature evaluation or rectal temperatures recorded every 10 minutes is ideal. Patients may shiver during cooling, which is counterproductive by producing heat. Treat shivering with low-dose benzodiazepines (lorazepaml mg N).

Heitz, MD Key Points Drowning is defined as the process of experiencing respiratory impairment from submersion/immersion in liquid. Consider that drowning may have resulted from a primary medical or traumatic insult. INTRODUCTION The term \"drowning incident\" encompasses a variety of clinical entities. A 2005 report from the World Health Organization recommends that the term \"near-drowning\" be abandoned and instead to use the term \"drowning inci\u00ad dent\" with a description of the outcome (death, morbidity, no morbidit y). Drowning itself should be described as \"the process of experiencing respiratory impairment from submersion/immersion in liquid.\" Nonfatal incidents are more common than fatal inci\u00ad dents; in 2009, 6,519 nonfatal drowning incidents were reported, whereas 4,211 incidents resulted in death. One estimate states that there is 1 death per 13 drowning inci\u00ad dents, suggesting that underreporting likely occurs. Children make up the majority of fatal incidents, with peak ages of 1-4 years and seasonal variability. Freshwater drowning is more common than saltwater, with bathtubs and pool as the most common locations. Accomplished swimmers make up 35o/o of deaths. CLINICAL PRESENTATION Wide variability exists in the presentation of drowning\u00ad related injury, both in terms of time of submersion/ immersion as well as how the patient is found. Children are often found face-down in small depths of water (bathtub, Treatment is largely supportive and stabilizing. Patients who present and remain asymptomatic for 6 hours may be discharged from the emergency department. 5-gallon bucket, toilet). Patients may fall or j urnp into a body of water and their distress is immedia tely noted or alternatively may be found floating or at the bottom of a lake or pool after a period of time without being seen. Symptoms also vary. Patients may be asymptomatic or may present with severe illness. Clinical effects of the sub\u00ad mersion/im mersion event itself most often manifest as respiratory abnormalities including hypoxia, tachypnea, or abnormal lung sounds. Depending on the season, patients may be hypothermic. At severe levels of illness, cardiac dysrhythmias may occur, and mental status can change. Most, if not all, drownings involve aspiration. \"Dry drown\u00ad ing\" (hypoxia from laryngospasm without aspiration) is thought to be extremely rare and physiologically difficult to explain. History Drowned patients should be initially evaluated like major trauma patients, with attention to the airway, breathing, and circulation (ABCs) and rapid assessment of an AMPLE history. When evaluating a patient who has experienced a drowning incident, the following information must be obtained: Events surrounding the incident (How did they end up in the water? Did they sustain any trauma?) Temperature of the water and air 270 DROWNING INCIDENTS Length of time in the water, length of time underwater Status on retrieval from the water (respiratory, men\u00ad tal status, cardiovascular, color) Was any immediate treatment needed? Current symptoms? It will also be important to consider the potential of suicide; the medical status of the patient will dictate how urgently this assessment is needed . ..... Physical Examination The order of the physical exam will depend on patient stability. Assess the unstable patient like a trauma patient, with a primary survey and management as necessary, fol\u00ad lowed by a thorough secondary survey. In the stable patient, an examination can be conducted in a head-to-toe fashion. Areas of focus include signs of external trauma, especially the head and neck, lung sounds to evaluate for water or emesis aspiration, skin color (cyanosis ), core body temperature (rectal), and a neurologic exam. DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES ..... Laboratory No specific laboratory testing is universally recommended for drowned patients. If the provider feels that significant aspiration occurred, or if the patient is unstable, usefullabo\u00ad ratory tests to determine the severity of injury include a blood count, serum electrolytes, and blood gases. To assess the pH, a venous gas is sufficient. Electrolyte changes may occur if large volumes of water are aspirated. Animal studies have shown that 11 mL/kg of aspirated hypotonic fluid are necessary before any effect is seen on hemoglobin, volume status, or electrolytes. Most drowning victims aspirate less than 4 mL/kg. In the majority of cases, hypoxia and meta\u00ad bolic acidosis cause the resultant morbidity and mortality. Other laboratory studies may be indicated in certain patients. Assessment of blood alcohol level, drug ingestions, and medical causes for the patient's submersion (myocardial infarction, syncope, stroke) should be considered. ..... Imaging Patients in whom significant aspiration is suspected should undergo chest radiograph y. The most common finding is an aspiration pneumon itis (Figure 64-l). Head and cervi\u00ad cal spine imaging should be considered if the patient dived into the water. Any other traumatic injuries noted on exam or suspected by history should be imaged and evaluated as appropriate. MEDICAL DECISION MAKING When a patient presents after a drowning incident, stabi\u00ad lization is the first priority. Once the patient is stabilized, a detailed history of events and a thorough physical ..&. Figure 64-1. Aspiration pneumoni tis. Reprinted with permission from Heitz . exam should be obtained. The focus of the evaluation is 2-fold: 1. To determine types and extent of injury (aspiration, exposure, trauma) 2. To determine whether this is a primary or secondary drowning incident Secondary drowning refers to a drowning incident that occurred as a result of a medical event, drug or alcohol ingestion, or preceding trauma. For instance, a boater who drowns in a lake may have ingested a large amount of alco\u00ad hol, causing him to fall into the water. A diver may strike her head on the bottom of the pool, causing prolonged submersion. Figure 64-2 delineates a suggested algorithm for management of the drowned patient. TREATMENT Initial stabilization and supportive care are the mainstays of emergency department (ED) treatment for drowned patients. Airway protection, management of hypoxia and hypothermia, and urgent/emergent treatment of traumatic injuries or medical emergencies take first priority. This may include placement of an endotracheal tube, high-flow oxygen, active rewarming, and volume resuscita tion. Patients who have aspirated large volumes may require positive pressure ventilation to recruit collapsed alveoli. If intubated and large-volume aspiration occurred, consider suctioning. Manage any cardiac dysrhythmias as recom\u00ad mended by Advanced Cardiac Life Support protocols. Treatments once suggested but not currently recom\u00ad mended are prophylactic antibiotics or steroids. In addition, hyperbaric chamber use has not been shown to be beneficial unless decompression illness complica tes the drowning.

Discharged patients should be instructed to return for development of difficulty breathing, fever, or mental status changes. DROWNING INCIDENTS SUGGESTED READING Causey, AL, Nichter, MA. Drowning.

Lank, MD Key Points In addition to any focused or antidotal therapy avail\u00ad able, aggressive symptom-based supportive care is important for all envenomations. Knowledge of local venomous species may be helpful, although be aware that patients may have contact with non local or exotic venomous animals. INTRODUCTION In 2010, there were more than 60,000 calls made to United States Poison Centers related to bites and envenomations. Although there are many venomous animal species in North America, a majority of these calls involved insects (including bees, wasps, hornets, and ants), arachnids (including spiders and scorpio ns), and snakes. From infor\u00ad mation provided in the 2010 Annual Report of the American Association of Poison Control Centers' National Poison Data System, there were a total of 5 fatalities related to all bites or envenomations and approximately 2,500 instances of antivenin being given. The clinical presentations of the various forms of venom exposure vary greatly and are dependent on mul\u00ad tiple factors including the species of the animal, the amount of venom delivered, and potential baseline medi\u00ad cal problems in the envenomed patient. Patients present\u00ad ing with an animal envenomation may therefore display a variety of symptoms ranging from local reaction to a bite or sting to generalized yet nonspecific effects (eg, vomit\u00ad ing, headache, hyperten sion) or toxin-specific findings (eg, paralysis or coagulopath y). This chapter focuses on the presentation, evaluation, and treatment of 2 of the most clinically relevant North American envenomations: snakes and spiders. North American venomous bites are rarely unprovoked. Contact your local poison control center (1-800-222-1222) for assistance with diagnosing and managing all enven\u00ad omations. Snakes Venomous snakes found in North America are most easily divided into their 2 families: Elapidae and Viperidae (sub\u00ad family Crotalinae ). The majority of venomous snakebites occurring yearly in North America are caused by snakes in the Crotalinae subfamily, which includes rattlesnakes (genus ). 5o/o of venomous snakebites are from the Elapidae family, which includes the coral snake. Fewer still may be from bites by exotic, nonnative snakes usually being kept as pets. Venomous snakes found natively in North America are generally nonpredatory to humans. Bites, therefore, take place on provocation of the snake-either intentional or accidental. These bites are typically located on extremities, but particu\u00ad larly troublesome cases have been reported in which venom\u00ad ous bites have involved the face, neck, or tongue. The vast majority of venomous snakebites occur in young men, with an appreciable association with alcohol intoxicati on. Children are also at a higher risk for being bitten by a venomous snake. There are a few characteristics that can help identify a North American snake as being part of the Crotalinae sub\u00ad family. These snakes have vertical slit-like pupils, long fangs, and a triangular head. This subfamily is also referred to as \"pit vipers\" because they have heat-sensing pits 274 ENVENOMATION Poisonous (pit vipers) Harmless Nostril Figure 65-1. Differences between venomous pit vipers and nonvenomous North American snakes. located on their heads just behind the nostrils and in front of the eyes (Figure 65-1). Crotaline venom contains a com\u00ad bination of chemicals that cause primarily local tissue damage and hematologic effects. Elapidae native to North America are the coral snakes. These snakes, found mostly in the Southeast United States (particularly Florida and Texas), have a characteristic color pattern that distinguishes them from the similar-appearing but nonvenomous scarlet king or milk snake. People often remem\u00ad ber this pattern difference by reciting the rhyme, \"Red on yel\u00ad low kills a fellow. Red on black, friend of Jack'' (Figure 65-2). Elapid venom has a curare-like neurotoxic effect and is said to be one of the most potent North American venoms. However, multiple characteristics of the snake make clinically significant bites from these snakes rare. They tend to reside in remote unpopulated areas and even if confronted will attempt to flee before biting. Unlike the crotalids, the elapids' fangs are short and unlikely to penetrate thick clothing or shoes. After biting, elapids will remain attached and \"chew'' on their victim to inject the venom. Although this makes it more difficult fur these snakes to deliver a clinically significant amount of venom, it also makes it more difficult to clinically assess a patient with a potential bite, as there may not be bite or fang marks in a patient who has had a potentially life-threatening envenomation. ..... Spiders Like snakes, there are 2 major groups of spiders that cause medically significant envenomations in North America: the black widow (genus Latrodectus) and the brown recluse (genus Loxosceles ). It is difficult to estimate the true inci\u00ad dence of spider bites, because the history of a bite is often\u00ad times unreliable, with many patients and physicians reasoning that a rash, abscess, or cellulitis originated from a spider bite when no spider was seen. Addition ally, with the CHAPTER 65 Figure 65-2. North American coral snake. Reproduced with permission from Knoop K}/ Stock LB/ Storrow AB/ et of. The Atlas of Emergency Medicine. 3rd ed. New York: McGraw-Hill Medical/ 2009. Figure 16.30. Photo contributor: Steven Holt MD. possible exception of the female black widow spider, the general public has difficulty distinguishing medically rele\u00ad vant spiders from those that are generally benign. That being said, bites from brown recluse and black widow spiders can be deadly in extreme circumstances and can unquestionably cause substantial morbidity and pain. There are 5 species of black widow spiders found in the United States. These spiders are medium- sized, typi\u00ad cally black colored, and have species-specific ventral markings. mactans has the charac\u00ad teristic red hourglass ventral marking and has a larger body and fangs than her male counterpart, making the female more likely to cause envenomation (Figure 65-3). The clinical effects of a black widow spider envenomation in humans are thought to be caused by the neurotoxin a-latrotoxi n. There are 2 major species of recluse spiders found in the United States: the Loxosceles reclusa (brown recluse) and Loxosceles deserta (desert recluse). The brown recluse is found primarily in the southern and midwestern United States, and the desert recluse's range is in the southwestern portion of the country. North American recluse spiders are brown to gray-colored with dark dorsal markings that have a violin pattern, giving it its other names, fiddle\u00ad back or violin spider (Figure 65-4). The toxin in recluse spider bites is complex, but is thought to contain proinflamma tory and necrosis- inducing substances similar to phospholipase D and hyaluronidase. CLINICAL PRESENTATION Snakes The severity of a crotaline envenomation depends on multiple factors, including the amount of venom deliv\u00ad ered, the potency of the venom, and the location of the venom (anatomically and by depth), as well as clinical Figure 65-3. Black widow spider, Latrodectus moctons/ with the characteristic ventral red hourglass. Reproduced with permission from Knoop KJ, Stack LB, Storrow AB, et al. The Atlas of Emergency Medicine. 3rd ed. New York: McGraw-Hill Medical, 2009:505. Photo contributor: Lawrence B. Stack, MD. characteristics of the envenomed patient. In 20-25% of crotaline bites, no significant amount of venom is deliv\u00ad ered, resulting in a \"dry bite.\" Multiple grading systems for crotaline envenomation severity have been developed, although most of these systems have limited utility in clinical practice. Instead, the clinical effects of these envenomations can be divided into 3 major categories: local/tissue, hematologic, and systemic effects. Local tis\u00ad sue damage from crotaline envenomation can range from minimal swelling and pain to severe edema, blistering, ecchymosis, and necrosis. Hematologic effects can be extreme after moderate to severe envenomations and include thrombocytopenia, elevated coagulation studies (prothrombin time and partial thrombop lastin time), as well as degradation of fibrinogen . Even with laboratory evidence of severe coagulopathies, however, most patients do not develop clinically significant hemorrhage. Systemic effects are nonspecific; include abdomina l pain, vomiting, diaphoresis, tachycardia, and hypotension; and may also be related to concomitant fear, anxiety, pain, or intoxication. In contrast with crotaline envenomations, patients with significant elapid envenomations may initially present with minimal symptoms. The neurologic systemic symptoms that characterize North American elapid envenomations are classically delayed for hours, with reports of patients being asympto matic up to 13 hours before developing ventilato r-requiring respiratory failure. It is difficult to determine who with an elapid exposure will develop symptoms of envenomation, as it has been estimated that approximately 60% of those bitten by a coral snake did not have an envenomation. Alternatively, 15% of those with coral snake envenom\u00ad ations have no fang marks, and only 40% have any local swelling. ENVENOMATION Figure 65-4.

New York: McGraw-Hill, 2010 . ...,._Spiders The clinical presentation of black widow spider bites is also referred to as latrodecti sm. The key feature of this syndrome is pain, which can be localized, radiating, or referred. This pain is gradual, beginning upward of an hour after the time of the bite, and is typically described as being severe muscle cramping pain in the bitten extremity , but especially with the North American black widow spider can involve the abdominal muscles, mimicking a surgical abdomen. Additional findings in latrodectism include localized areas of diaphoresis, nau\u00ad sea, vomiting, restlessness, fasciculations, fear of death (pavor mortis), and rarely priapism. The constellation of symptoms called \"facies latrodectismica\" is also specific to black widow spider envenomation and is a painful facial grimace with associated conjunctivitis, blepharitis, diaphoresis, and trismus. \"Loxoscelism\" is the term used to describe envenom\u00ad ation from recluse spiders and can be divided into cutaneous and viscerocutaneous or systemic forms. Of significant recluse spider envenomations, the cutaneous form is the most commonly seen in North America. These patients will initially have little to no pain at the bite site, only to develop a more remarkable hemorrhagic or ulcer\u00ad ative painful lesion 2-8 hours after the bite. This progresses to ulceration and necrosis with surrounding erythema and induration up to 7 days after the initial bite when an eschar generally forms. This wound then slowly heals over weeks to months. Systemic loxoscelism occurs 1-3 days after the recluse spider bite and is primarily characterized by hemo\u00ad lytic anemia. Clinically, the patient may develop nonspe\u00ad cific systemic symptoms such as fever, rash, weakness, arthralgia, nausea, and vomit ing. This autoimmune hemolytic anemia can be accompanied by tluombocytope\u00ad nia and rhabdomyolysis and rarely progresses to renal failure and death. HISTORY ...,._Snakes North American snakes rarely attack unprovoked, although this provocation may be unintentional by the envenomed patient. Most bites occur during warm months, as snakes hibernate in the winter. They also more commonly occur on extremities-the areas of the body most likely to dis\u00ad turb a venomous snake. Young men are at particularly high risk of being bitten by a venomous snake, and it has been recognized that snakebites are frequently associated with alcohol intoxication. ...,._Spiders North American black widow spiders tend to be nonag\u00ad gressive and only attack when their web is encroached on. These areas tend to be in dark places, such as garden equip\u00ad ment, shoes, socks, and other clothing. Recluse spiders in North America tend to cause envenomation in domestic environments, where they hide in furniture, clothing, and sheets, particularly if they have not been used or disturbed for a while. Most recluse bites therefore happen at night or in the early morning and occur on the thigh, trunk, or proximal arm. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION Focused physical examination includes inspection of the possible bite area as well as screening for any associated traumatic injury. Palpation of the bite area and marking of CHAPTER 65 History & physical exam Identify snake/spider Determine clinical effects Call poison control center Figure 65-5. Envenomation diagnostic algorithm. any wound margins will assist in deciding whether there is progression of local tissue injury from envenomation. However, as was discussed previously, local inspection of elapid snakebites can be deceptively reassuring. Instead, in these patients, physical examination may focus on a more detailed neurologic examination. DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES For crotaline envenomations, obtain a complete blood count (CBC; specifically for hemoglobin and platelet counts), coagulation studies, and fibrinogen level. If concern for retained foreign body at a bite site exists, an x-ray may be obtained. If there is concern for systemic loxoscelism, a CBC and coagulation studies are recommended as well as chemistry panel to assess for renal dysfunction. MEDICAL DECISION MAKING If available, a picture of the snake/spider will aid in identification and further management. A thorough history and physical examination to determine any clinical effects, which can be local, hematologic, or systemic, is performed. Examination of the skin for bite marks to determine whether significant envenomation has occurred is unreliable, especially in cases of a coral snake bite. Contact the poison control center for assistance in identification and management (Figure 65-5). TREATMENT Snakes Many field treatments exist particularly for crotaline snakebites. However, few of them have been found to be particularly helpful, and many may be quite harmful to the patient. Such dangerous techniques include but are not limited to cutting the bite site, attempting to extract venom from the site (either orally or via commercia lly available devices), applying tourniquets to the bitten extremity, or applying electrical shocks to the victim. Instead, field management should consist solely of immobilization of the bitten extremity, limiting the victim's exertion, and rapidly obtaining medical evacuation and attention. In the ED, further stabilization measures for crotaline snakebites include extremity immobilization and elevation, pain treatment, management of systemic symptoms, and assessment of tetanus vaccination status. Treatment and disposition management decisions should always involve the assistance of a poison control center (1-800-222-12 22) or a local toxicologist. ENVENOMATION Moderate to severe North American crotaline envenomations should be treated with Crotalidae ovine) snake antivenom ( CroFab). These envenomations will be characterized by the presence of a bite site with more than minimal swelling, redness, or ecchymosis, or one with progression of any of these findings. Additiona lly, systemic findings and any hematologic abnormalities should prompt initiation of antivenom. Antivenom is given by intravenous infusion of 4-6 vials of antivenom in 250 mL of normal saline given over 1 hour. lf initial control has been achieved with this initial dose, the patient should be admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) for observation and consideration of maintenance dosing. lf control was not achieved by the initial dose, that dose can be repeated. Prophylactic antibiotics are not recommended for routine use in crotaline envenomations. Addition ally, unless the patient develops an allergic reaction of some sort, routine use of steroids is not recommended. Because of theoretical hematologic effects of nonsteroidal anti\u00ad inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), some experts prefer pain control with opioids. Because of the deceptively benign appearance of potentially significant elapid snakebites, the treatment course is more reflexively conservative than that described for crotaline envenomations. It was previously recommended that any patient with bite marks or evidence of skin penetra\u00ad tion receive elapid (equine) antivenin. However, the makers of the product have discontinued manufacture, so there is currently only very limited supply in endemic areas. In the event of a suspected elapid snakebite, the poison control center should be contacted immedia tely to determine need for and possible location of any available antivenin. ..... Spiders Although multiple therapeutic options have been investigated for black widow spider bites, aggressive supportive symp\u00ad tomatic care is currently recommended. Studies on the use of intravenous calcium and Latrodectus antivenoms have been contradictory and largely unimpressive for appreciable difference from placebo. It is therefore recommended that pain associated with black widow spider bites be managed as other painful conditions would be, with attempts at treating with NSAIDs, opioids, and/or benzodiazepines as deemed appropriate. Multiple specific therapies have also been studied for loxoscelism. The most dangerous and ill-advised of these therapies have included shock therapy, liberal use of prophylactic surgical excision, and dapsone. These thera\u00ad pies, while ineffective in treating recluse envenomation, also are thought to cause worsening wound healing (for shock and surgical excision) or undesirable medica\u00ad tion effects (such as methemoglobinemia with dapsone). Antivenoms are currently investigational and are not available in the United States. What is instead recommended is excellent wound care, symptomatic management, and appropriate focused treatment of potential adverse effects of systemic loxoscelism. DISPOSITION ..... Admission All symptomatic patients from elapid envenomation require ICU admission for anticipated respiratory failure. Asymptomatic patients receiving elapid antivenin will need to be observed for neurologic symptoms. Asymptomatic patients not receiving antivenin should also be observed for 24 hours, because risk stratification in these patients has been found to be so difficult. ..... Discharge For crotaline snakebites, patients with an apparent \"dry bite\" or those without bite marks can be observed in the ED for 8 hours and discharged without focused therapy. Patients with minor envenomations, characterized by only mild local findings on skin examination with the absence of hematologic or systemic abnorma lities, should be observed for 12-24 hours with repeat blood testing and may be discharged home without antivenom administra \u00ad tion if their symptoms remain mild. Patients requiring antivenom administration should be observed for 18-24 hours after control of symptoms was obtained. These patients will also need close outpatient follow-up for repeat laboratory work to evaluate for any worsening hematologic abnormalities and must be given very strict discharge instructi ons.

Diabetic Emergencies Sarah E. Ronan-Bentle, MD Key Points Hyperglycemia causes an osmotic diuresis that may result in dehydration. Patients with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperglyc emic hyperosmolar state (HHS) are treated with intravenous fluids and insulin. Potassium supplementation should begin as soon as the potassium level is in the normal range. INTRODUCTION Diabetes mellitus is a common disorder and is present in 6% of the population in the United States. Diabetes mellitus is defined as fasting blood glucose> 126 mg/dL on 2 separate occasions or a random glucose >200 mg/dL plus the classic symptoms of hyperglycemia (ie, polyuria, polydipsia). Derangement of glucose homeostasis is a continuum that ranges from hypoglycemia on one extreme to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) on the other end of the spectrum. Hyperglycemia, even in the absence of DKA or hyperglycemic hyperosmol ar state (HHS), has many deleterious effects. An osmotic diuresis occurs when an elevated glucose level overwhelms the kidneys and begins to pull electrolytes and water into the urine. In the healthy individual, serum glucose of 240 mg!dL is required before glucose is found in the urine. Addition ally, hyperglycemia impairs leukocyte function and wound healing, making patients prone to infection. Chronic hyperglycemia causes renal failure, blindness, neuropathy, and atheroscler osis. Diabetic ketosis is an intermediate metabolic state between hyperglycemia and ketoacidosis. Patients have an inadequate amount of insulin to provide the necessary energy substrates to the cell. As a result, lipolysis is Both DKA and HHS are often precipitated by another illness, frequently infection. An attempt should be made to search for and treat any precipitating illness. When treating patients with HHS, it is important to follow sodium and serum osmolality measurements to document return to normal values. stimulated to provide ketone bodies that can be used as substrates by the brain and other tissues. The ketone bodiesincludeacetoacetat e,acetone,andP-h ydroxybutyrate. DKA is defined < 15 mEq/L, ketonemia, pH <7.3. DKA is present in 5-10% of hospitalized patients. It is the presenting illness of diabetes mellitus in 15-25% of patients. When making the diagnosis of DKA, the physician should attempt to determine what has precipitated the illness. The most common causes of DKA are the \"3 I's\": insulin lack, ischemia (cardiac), and infection. The mortality rate of patients with DKA is approximately 5% and most often is attributable to concomitant illness. In DKA, reduced circulatory insulin levels do not allow glucose to reach the intracellular space. In response, the cell stimulates lipolysis, which provides the body with glycerol (substrate for gluconeogen esis) and free fatty acids. Free fatty acids are a precursor to the ketoacids, acetoacetate, acetone, and P-hydroxybutyrate. The ketone bodies can be used as an energy source, but when they are present in excess, metabolic acidosis results. HHS occurs when a hyperglycemic osmotic diuresis causes extreme dehydrati on. Defining features serum glucose >600 mg/dL, plasma osmolality >320 mOsm/L, and the absence of ketoacidosis. HHS is 280 DIABETIC EMERGENCIES most common in elderly individuals. It results in <1 o/o of diabetes-related hospital admissions, but has a reported mortality rate of 20-60%. HHS occurs when a prolonged osmotic diuresis from hyperglycemia results in severe dehy\u00ad dration and an elevated serum osmolality. Concurrent medical illness is very common and is often a precipitating cause of HHS. CLINICAL PRESENTATION History Patients with hyperglycemia report polydipsia and polyuria. They may also present with blurry vision owing to changes in the shape of the lens induced by osmotic movements of water. Recovery is spontaneous, but may take up to 1 month. Patients with DKA present with often vague complaints such as nausea, fatigue, or generalized weakness. Vomiting and abdominal pain may be present. Altered mental status (AMS) also occurs in severe disease and is closely correlated with a high serum osmolality. In patients with HHS, AMS is the most common presen\u00ad tation. Additional neurologic complaints include seizures, hemiparesis, and coma. Coma is present in only 10% of cases. Physical Examination Patients with hyperglycemia or diabetic ketosis may exhibit evidence of mild dehydration. In DKA, vital signs are often abnormal, with tachycar\u00ad dia and tachypnea, with characteristic Kussmaul respira\u00ad tions. If there is severe dehydration or sepsis, hypotension or hyperthermia may be present. Hypothermia is a poor prog\u00ad nostic sign. Fruity odor on the breath owing to ketonemia may be present. Evidence of dehydration includes dry mucous membranes, decreased skin turgor, and tachycardia. Urine output may be maintained because of the ongoing osmotic diuresis. Physical examination may reveal a source of infection such as pneumonia, pyelonephritis, or cellulitis. In HHS, physical examination findings are similar to those ofDKA. Patients usually show evidence of severe dehy\u00ad dration. AMS is a hallmark. A focused neurologic examina\u00ad tion is indicated in these patients to detect focal neurologic deficits. Searching for other precipitating causes that can be seen on physical examination such as infection is imperative. DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES Laboratory The first most important test to obtain is a fingerstick blood glucose at the bedside to rapidly establish the presence of hyperglycemia. The accuracy of these machines is known to decrease at extreme elevations, and many will not read values >600 mg/dL. Obtain serum electrolytes, renal function, serum osmolality, and urine ketones. In DKA, the bicarbonate level will be low, and there will be an elevated anion gap. The serum potassium level is frequently elevated as a result of acidemia, causing a shift of potassium into the extracellular space. As treatment is initiated, potassium is drawn back into the cells, exposing a total body potassium that is low. Sodium concentration is also frequently low, usually artifi\u00ad cially, because water is drawn out of the intracellular space by the elevated glucose. To account for this, the sodium concentration is corrected by adding 1.6 mEq/L (correction factor) for every 100 mg!dL increase in the glucose. A cor\u00ad rection factor of 2.4 mEq/L is more accurate for glucose levels >400 mg!dL. In HHS, the measured (uncorrected) sodium concentration, glucose level, and blood urea nitro\u00ad gen (BUN) are used to calculate the serum test used for the detection of ketones on urinalysis identifies acetoacetate and acetone but does not detect -hydroxyb utyrate. In DKA, there is a predomi\u00ad nance of -hydroxybutyrate. Despite some earlier concerns that urine ketones could be falsely normal in DKA because of the predominance of -hydroxyb utyrate, this has not turned out to be the case in clinical practice. Urine ketones can be used as an accurate screen for the presence of serum ketones. However, it should be remembered that as treat\u00ad ment ensues, a shift to acetoacetate and acetone makes urine ketones more positive despite adequate treatment. The pH of a venous blood gas is an accurate estimation of the arterial pH in DKA and can be used to guide man\u00ad agement. To determine complex acid-base disorders, an arterial blood gas can be obtained, but this test rarely impacts treatment deci sions. When there is suspicion of an underlying infection, blood cultures, urinalysis, and urine culture should also be obtained. Electrocardiogram An electrocardiogram is obtained to evaluate for signs of hyperkalemia or cardiac ischemia. Imaging A chest x-ray is indicated when clinical symptoms suggest pneumonia or another concomitant cardiopulmonary illness. Head computed tomography scan is obtained to rule out precipitating cranial pathology (ie, stroke, intracranial hem\u00ad orrhage) if the patient has AMS. MEDICAL DECISION MAKING The differential diagnosis of DKA includes all causes of metabolic acidosis with an anion gap (methanol ingestion, uremia or failure, isoniazid, lactic acidosis, ethylene glycol ingestion, alcoholic ketoacidosis, salicylate toxicity) . History and laboratory data should provide the clues to make the appropriate diagnosis. In determining the pre\u00ad cipitant ofDKA, the differential diagnosis includes sources of infection, cerebral vascular accident, and acute CHAPTER 66 Urine for ketones, serum electrolytes glucose, \u00b1blood gas coronary syndrome. Noncompliance with insulin therapy is a diagnosis of exclusion. Often presenting complaints of patients with DKA include abdominal pain, and thus the differential diagnosis also includes appendicitis, pancreatitis, and gastroenteritis. These are ruled in or out primarily based on history and physical exam. In HHS, the differential diagnosis includes DKA and alcoholic ketoacidosis. Precipitating causes are varied and are included or excluded based on history and physical exam. These include multiple types of medications such as diuret\u00ad ics, lithium, beta-blockers, and antipsychotics; trauma; burns; and cocaine toxicity. For differentiating hyperglycemic conditions, see Figure 66-l. TREATMENT Diabetic patients who are noncompliant or inadequately treated are frequently seen in the emergency department, and there is some controversy regarding the best treatment for these patients once it is determined that they do not have DKA or HHS. Treatment will depend on the degree of elevation of the glucose level and the presence of dehydra\u00ad tion. Options include initiating or restarting an oral antihy\u00ad perglycemic medication (ie, glipizide or metformin), administering N or oral fluids and rechecking the glucose level, or administering insulin (usually regular insulin SQ) and rechecking the glucose level. Correction of dehydration prevents further osmotic diuresis. The 3 pillars of treatment of D KA are fluids, insulin, and potassium, which are generally administered in that order. The initial N fluid given is 1 L of 0.9 normal saline (NS) over 30-60 minutes. Depending on the size of the patient, often a second liter of 0.9 NS is also administered. Then switch to 0.45 NS. Be careful to avoid fluid overload in patients with congestive heart failure. General total body water depletion in patients with DKA is 6-8 L. Insulin can be initiated after the first liter of fluids. An N bolus (0.15 U/kg) is optional. Start an N infusion of 0.1 U/kg/hr of regular insulin. Continue N insulin until the pH is >7.3 and the anion gap has closed. Switch to D5 0.45 NS when the glucose level is <250 mg/dL. Treatment with supplemental potassium depends on the initial potassium level. For K >5.5 mEq/L: hold treatment. If K 3.5-5.5 mEq/L: add 10-20 mEq to each liter of IV fluids if renal function is normal. If K <3.5 mEq/L: add 40 mEq to each liter of N fluids if renal function is normal. If K <3.5 mEq/L: do not administer insulin until the serum K is >4.0 mEq/L. It is important to monitor serum glucose and serum electrolytes, including magnesium and phosphate regularly, as electrolyte shifts occur quickly in DKA. Obtain serum glucose once every hour after starting an insulin drip. Check electrolytes every 2-4 hours. Magnesium and phosphate replacement may be required. In HHS, the average fluid deficit is 8-12 L. Use 0.9 NS for the initial resuscitation (1 L). Switch to 0.45 NS at a rate of 200-500 rnL/hr. Goal is 3-4 Lover the initial4-hour period. The corrected serum sodium and the serum osmolarity should be gradually returned to normal over a 24-to 36-hour period. Insulin N infusion can be started after initiating infusion of N fluids. A total of 0.1 U/kg/hr of regular insulin is given if the K >3.3 mEq/L. Potassium replacement is similar to that in patients with DKA. Frequent monitoring of glucose and electrolytes is necessary to avoid iatragenic electrolyte abnormalities, such as hypokalemia. DIABETIC EMERGENCIES DISPOSITION .... Admission Admission is indicated for patients with DKA and HHS. An intensive care unit (ICU) setting is appropriate for all patients with HHS. In DKA, AMS or pH <7.0 generally necessitate ICU admission. ..... Discharge Discharge is appropriate for patients with hyperglycemia once DKA and HHS have been excluded. Patients should be given instructions to obtain close follow-up. SUGGESTED READING Chansky ME, Lubkin CL. Emergency Medicine: NY: Emergency Medicine: NY: 2011, pp.1440-1444 al.

Moore, MD Key Points Obtain an electrocardiogram (ECG) early in patients with suspected hyperkalemia and never ignore a K+ >6.0 mEq/L. Patients with ECG changes consistent with hyperkalemia require prompt treatment to avoid a life-threatening dysrhythmia. INTRODUCTION Potassiwn (K +) is involved in maintaining the resting cell membrane potential. Small shifts in potassiwn concentration result in problems with muscle and nerve conduction, leading to potentially life-threatening disorders of the cardiac and neuromuscular systems. The normal plasma concentration of potassiwn is 3.5-5.5 mEq/L. Hyperkalemia is defined as potassiwn level mEq/L. be classified as (6.1-7.0 mEq/L), and severe (>7.0 mEq/L). Hyperkalemia is present in approximately So/o of hospitalized patients. If not treated promptly, two thirds of patients with severe hyperkalemia (>7.0 mEq/L) will die. Etiologies include pseudohyperkalemia (red blood cell hemo\u00ad lysis, white blood cell count > 200,000, or platelet count > 1 million), transcellular shifts (acidosis one), cell breakdown (crush injury, burns, twnor lysis), increased intake (conswnption of fruits or salt substitutes), or impaired excretion (renal failure, Addisonian crisis, or type 4 renal tubular acidosis). Hypokalemia is defined as potassiwn level <3.5 mEq/L. Mild hypokalemia is present when the serwn potassiwn concentration is between 3.1 and 3.4 mEq/L) and severe ( <2.5 mEq/L) hypokalemia are less common. Approximately 15o/o of emergency department The most common cause of hypokalemia in a patient in the emergency department is diuretic (loop or thiazide) use. Replacing K+ via the oral route is safe and is the preferred method for cases of mild to moderate hypokalemia. patients are mildly hypokalemic. The percentage increases to 80o/o in patients taking diuretics, especially loop or thiazide diuretics. Etiologies for hypokalemia include decreased intake, transcellular shifts (respiratory or metabolic alkalo\u00ad sis), medication effects (diuretics, insulin, or -2 adrenergic stimulation), thyrotoxi cosis, hypokalemic periodic paralysis, or excessive losses from the renal (hyperaldosteronism, Cushing syndrome, type 1 renal tubular acidosis) or gastro\u00ad intestinal (vomiting, diarrhea) systems. CLINICAL PRESENTATION History Symptoms of hyperkalemia and hypokalemia are vague and frequently include fatigue and generalized weakness. Other features include paresthesias, nausea, vomiting, constipation, abdominal pain, psychosis, or depression. A history of vomit\u00ad ing, diarrhea, renal failure, thyroid disease, adrenal disease, or use of offending medications should raise suspicions. Physical Examination Patients with potassium disorders may not have any physi\u00ad cal manifesta tions. In an unresponsive patient, evidence of dialysis access (arteriovenous [AV] fistulae, AV grafts, or tunneled catheters) may provide an indication of the pos\u00ad sibility of these conditio ns. Patients may also display signs 284 POTASSIUM DISORDER S of illnesses that cause potassiwn disorders, such as paraly\u00ad sis, tachycardia, rashes, or striations. Patients with a hyperkalemia-induced QRS widening may appear brady\u00ad cardic before degeneration into a sinusoidal rhythm (see Diagnostic Studies). DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES Laboratory An electrolyte panel will detect abnormalities of potassiwn (turnaround time is approximately 30-40 minutes). A potassiwn level can be obtained using many blood gas ana\u00ad lyzers. Advantages include a more rapid turnaround time (2 minutes). However, blood gas analyzers are unable to detect a hemolyzed sample and therefore may overdiagnose hyper\u00ad kalemia. A magnesiwn level should be obtained in patients with hypokalemia, because of the difficulty in correcting low potassiwn in the setting of low magnesiwn levels. Electrocardiogram Symmetrical T-wave peaking, P-wave flattening, QRS wid\u00ad or are characteristic of hyperka\u00ad lemia (Figure 67-1). Unfortunately, the electrocardiogram (ECG) lacks sensitivity to detect elevated potassiwn levels. Only 50-60% of patients with potassium levels >6.5 mEq/L have any of the preceding ECG findings. Hypokalemia is manifested by U-waves, T-wave flattening, and ST -segment depression. Dysrhyth mias, including ven-tricular fibrillation, may occur in patients with severe hypokalemia or in patients with moderate hypokalemia and a history of cardiac disease. MEDICAL DECISION MAKING Patients with a history consistent with a potassiwn disor\u00ad der ( eg, missed dialysis, profuse diarrhea) should have immediate ECG testing performed and should be placed on a cardiac monitor. An electrolyte panel or arterial blood gas with electrolytes should be drawn. If an ECG is consistent with hyperkalemia, therapy should be initiated immediately, before confirmatory tests. Before treating isolated hyperkalemia detected on an electrolyte panel, pseudoh yperkalemia (hemolysis) should be ruled out by communi cation with the lab. Patients who are dialysis dependent or who remain hyperkalemic despite treat\u00ad ment should have emergent dialysis arranged. Patients with hypokalemia should have potassium and magne\u00ad sium repleted (Figure 67-2). TREATMENT Hyperkalemia All patients with hyperkalemia should be put on a car\u00ad diac monitor, and an ECG should be performed. If QRS widening or arrhythmias are noted on a rhythm strip or ECG, calcium, given as calcium gluconate 10% (less irri- f>1;e I oft Figure 67-1. ECG changes of hyperkalemia.

ECG, Electrocardiogram. tation to peripheral veins) or calcium chloride 10% (3x more calcium) should be administered to stabilize myocar\u00ad dial membranes. Calcium can be repeated every 5 minutes until the ECG normalizes. The duration of action is 30-60 minutes. Calcium is not indicated in the stable patient when the ECG shows only peaked T waves. Avoid giving calcium when treating hyperkalemia with coexisting digoxin toxicity, because intracellular calcium is already elevated in digoxin toxicity. Further administration of calcium may cause asystole and death. Therapy should also be instituted to induce an intracel\u00ad lular shift of potassium. Insulin 0.1 Unit/kg intravenously (IV) is administered to shift potassium into the cell via an intracellular messenger. Within 30 minutes, insulin will reduce the potassium level by 0.5-1.0 mEq/L. In patients with normal glucose levels, administer 25-50 g ( 1/2-1 amp) of dextrose rv. An alternate method in stable patients is to add 10 Units of regular insulin in 500 mL of D10W and administer this over a 1-hour period. Patients with chronic renal failure given insulin should have fingerstick glucose monitoring initiated, as hypoglycemia is not uncommon. Nebulized albuterol also shifts potassium back into cells and may work synergistically with insulin. Albuterol 10-20 mg in 4 mL of NS is given via nebulizer over 10 minutes. Sodium bicarbonate (NaHC0 3) also shifts potassium back into cells and leads to increased potassium excretion by the kidneys. One amp (SO mEq) infused over a 5-minute period has an onset in 5-10 minutes and lasts 2 hours. POTASSIUM DISORDER S Finally, potassium elimination therapy should be initi\u00ad ated. Furosemide 20-40 mg IV in patients not already taking the drug will reduce potassium levels. The onset is several hours, and the amount of decrease in the potas\u00ad sium level is variable. Cation exchange resins like sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate) remove up to 1 mEq potassium per gram. A standard dose is 30 g mixed with 50 mL of 20% sorbitol to induce diarrhea. It can be administered rectally (50 g with 200 mL 20% sorbitol), if necessary. Onset is delayed and may take more than 4 hours. Dialysis should be activated early for patients in renal failure. Dialysis is also indicated in refractory cases. Treatment for the underlying disorder (eg, steroids for Addisonian crisis, Fab fragments for digoxin toxicity) should be initiated as soon as possible. Hypokalemia Patients with hypokalemia should be put on a cardiac monitor. Oral K+ replacement (40 mEq/day) is safe and generally recommended in patients with mild to moderate hypokalemia. IV K + should be used if cardiac dysrhyth \u00ad mias or severe hypokalemia are present. The rate of infu\u00ad sion should be no more than 20 mEq/hr, especially when the infusion is to run through a peripheral IV line. Pain and burning with peripheral IV potassium replacement can be treated by slowing down the infusion rate. Avoid IV potassium in patients in renal failure. Physicians should treat concomi tant hypomagnesemia, as potassium reple\u00ad tion is dependent of magnesium. DISPOSITION Admission Because of the potential for life-threatening arrhythmias, all patients with moderate to severe hyperkalemia (K + level >6.0 mEq/L) or severe hypokalemia (K+ level <2.5 mEq/L) should be admitted to a hospital bed with a cardiac monitor. Discharge Patients with mild to moderate hypokalemia (K+ 2.5- 3.4 mEq/L) and no clinical symptoms may be discharged with appropriate oral repletion therapy. Mildly hyperkale\u00ad mic (K+ level <6.0 mEq/L) who are asymptomatic, have no ECG changes consistent with hyperkalemia, and have an identifiable and correctable cause of their hyperkalemia can be considered for discharge with early follow-up for a repeat electrolyte panel.

Thyroid Emergencies Monika Pitzele, MD Key Points In a critically ill patient with a goiter or history of hyperthyroidism, consider and treat thyroid storm early. Thyroid storm and myxedema coma are clinical diagnoses that do not depend on the absolute levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone and free thyroxine. INTRODUCTION Thyroid hormone (TH) is synthesized within the follicular cells of the thyroid gland. Production begins with the uptake of iodine into the follicular lumen. Thyroglobulin, pro\u00ad duced within the follicular cell, is bound to iodine and then coupled to produce the thyroid hormones, thyroxine (T 4) and triiodothyrinine (T3). Release of thyroid hormone is stimulated by one of the hormones secreted by the pituitary gland, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). hormone (TRH) secreted by the hypothalamus. High levels ofT4 and T3 act to suppress production of TSH and TRH via a negative feedback loop. TH released from the thyroid gland is in its less active form, T4, which is converted in peripheral organs (kidney and liver) into its 10 times more active derivative, T3\" The half\u00ad life of T 3 is significantly shorter, approximately a day, compared with 1 week for T4 In the serum, the majority of TH is bound to thyroid-binding globulin (TBG), making it inactive. The only active forms are free T3 and T4 After TH enters cells, it binds to its nuclear receptor and regulates expression of genes involved in lipid and carbohydrates metabolism and protein synthesis. As a net result of its action, there is an increase in basal metabolic rate. Emergencies related to the thyroid gland can be caused by both excess and deficiency of TH. Excess of TH can Myxedema coma should be considered in elderly hypothyroid patients who present with hypothermia and confusion. For successful treatment, it is important to try to iden\u00ad tify a trigger that pushed the patient into the extreme state of thyroid storm or myxedema coma. cause a syndrome referred to as thyrotoxicosis and can be caused either by excessive production of TH or its exogenous administration. In its extreme state, thyrotoxicosis can lead to a life-threatening condition called thyroid storm, a state manifesting with fever, tachycardia, and altered mental status. Hyperthyroidism is the term used when excessive production of TH by the thyroid is the cause of thyrotoxi \u00ad cosis. One of the most common causes of hyperthyroidism is Graves disease (approximately 80% of cases), in which autoimmune antibodies that bind to TSH receptors on the surface of thyroid cells stimulate production and release of TH. Other significant causes of hyperthyroidism include toxic multinodular goiter, thyroiditis, pituitary adenoma, and reaction to drugs ( eg, lithium, amiodarone and iodine). Hyperthyroidism is 10 times more common in women. Insufficiency of TH is referred to as hypothyroidism, and 95% of the time it is caused by dysfunction of the thyroid gland. One of the more common causes of hypo\u00ad thyroidism is Hashimoto thyroiditis, an autoimmune condition in which the body produces antibodies to the TSH receptor, which block signaling, and does not allow production of TH. Other causes include iodine deficiency, infiltrative diseases affecting the thyroid gland, or adminis\u00ad tration of ( eg, arniodar its extreme, hypothy\u00ad roidism can manifest as myxedema coma, a severe and 288 THYROID EMERGENCIES life-threatening state that occurs more frequently in the elderly. CLINICAL PRESENTATION History Depending on the degree of abnormal ity, patients will present with varied severity of symptoms. Patients with earlier stages of thyrotoxicosis will report excessive sweat\u00ad ing, weight loss, palpitations, anxiety, and heat intolerance. Patients in thyroid storm will present with symptoms of thyrotoxi cosis in addition to fever, tachycardia, altered mental status, and often congestive heart failure. In elderly patients, there is a rare form of thyrotoxi cosis referred to as apathetic hyperthy roidism, presenting with lethargy, altered mental status, blepharoptosis (drooping of the upper eye lid), weight loss, and atrial fibrillation leading to congestive heart failure. On the opposite side of the spectrum, patients with hypo\u00ad thyroidism complain of fatigue, depression, weight gain, cold intolerance, and dry skin. In its severe state, myxedema coma, patients present with altered mental status, bradycardia, hypothermia, hypoventila tion, and hypotension. Both thyroid storm and myxedema coma usually occur in patients with previously diagnosed thyroid disorders and are usually precipitated by other factors, such as infection, trauma, diabetic ketoacidosis, stroke, surgery, or medication noncompliance. Physical Examination Clinical findings in both hyper-and hypothyroidism are summarized in Table 68-1. Not all the signs and symptoms will be present in every patient. Frequent findings in patients with hyperthyroidism owing to Graves disease include goiter, exopthal mos, palmar erythema, and tachy\u00ad cardia (Figure 68-1). In thyroid storm, in addition to those findings, patients will have altered mental status, fever, hypertension, and frequently atrial fibrillation. Hypothyroid patients will present with fatigue, periorbital edema, hair loss, and dry skin. Myxedema coma patients will have altered mental status, hypothermia, hypotension, and myxedema (non-pitting peripherial edema owing to the accumulation of mucopolysaccharides in the skin). DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES Laboratory It is important to note that both thyroid storm and myx\u00ad edema coma are clinical diagnoses and are not defined by absolute levels of hormones. The main test used for assessment of thyroid function is ISH level, and its use as a single test is appropriate for an initial evaluation of thy\u00ad roid function. In patients with an intact hypothalamic\u00ad pituitary-thyroid axis, small changes in the level of TH will lead to significant changes in ISH levels. In a majority of cases, normal ISH effectively excludes dysfunction of Table 68-1. Comparison of clinical presentation of patients with hyper-and hypothyroidism.

'lid lag is tested by having a patient look straight and placing an object in the midline of their vision slightly above the eye level.

Lag is present if the lid does not follow the iris immediately and white sclera is visible between the lid and the limbus. ,,.\u00b7,change in deep tendon reflexes is described as Woltman sign. This sign consists of brief upstroke and slow relaxation. the thyroid gland. Because of the negative feedback mechanism by TH, low ISH will indicate hyperthyro id\u00ad ism, and high ISH will suggest primary hypothyroidism (Table 68-2). If ISH is abnormal, free T4 level should be ordered (FT4). In special circumstances, for example, in severely ill patients with high suspicion of thyroid dys\u00ad function, it is appropriate to order ISH and FT 4 \u00b1 free T 3 at the same time. It is not useful to order total T 3 or T 4 levels from the emergency department (ED). Although only free TH is clinically active, more than 99% of both T 3 and T 4 are protein bound in the serum. Measuring the total level of the hormones does not reliably provide information about the clinical thyroid status. Very frequently, the onset of thyroid storm or myx\u00ad edema coma is triggered by non-thyro id-related illness, CHAPTER 68 .A. Figure 68-1. Goiter. such as infection, myocardial infarction, stroke, diabetic ketoacidosis, etc. Other tests should be devoted to deter\u00ad mining the etiology of the precipit ating event. Depending on the clinical presentation, those tests include complete blood count, chemi stry, cardiac enzymes, electrocardiogram, urinalysis and blood, and urine cultures. Imaging Imaging studies ordered from the ED will be more us eful in identifying a precipitating event (for example, chest Table 68-2. Changes in laboratory measurements of TSH and free T4 (FT4) in thyroid disorders. Thyroid Disorder TSH Level Free T 4 Level Primary hyperthyroidism Low High Primary hypothyroidism High Low Secondary hyperthyroidism High High Secondary hyperthyroidism Low Low Primary disorders (intact hypothalamus and pituitary function, thyroid gland dysfunction) constitute a significant majority of cases. In those cases, low TSH and high FT 4 suggest thyrotoxicosis, and high TSH and low FT 4 suggest hypothyr oidism. In a small percentage of cases, malfunction of pituitary gland affects the downstream function of thyroid gland hypo\u00ad thyroid). For example, pituitary adenoma overproducing TSH will result in high TSH levels and subsequently high FT 4 levels. Panhypopitu itarism resulting from tumor s, hemorrhage, or infil\u00ad trative disease would cause low TSH and subsequently low FT 4. x-ray) than in evaluation of thyroid dysfunction. Of note, use of computed tomogra phy with iodinated contrast should be avoided whenever possible in patients with thyrotoxicosis because administration of iodinated con\u00ad trast may precipitate thyroid storm. In addition, iodin\u00ad ated contrast diminishes the effectiveness of nuclear thyroid imaging that is used for both diagnostic and treatment purposes. This effect persists for several weeks after an iodine load. MEDICAL DECISION MAKING Differential diagnosis for patients presenting with severe symptoms of thyrotoxi cosis includes other life-threatening conditions such thomimetic overdose (cocaine or ampheta mine), or neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Similarly, patients in myxedema coma may appear similar to patients in sepsis or adrenal crisis. If the patient has a history of thyroid problems, it should raise the index of suspicion for thy\u00ad roid disorder. Of note, it is not uncommon for patients with a history of treated hyperthy roidism ( eg, Graves disease treated with thyroidectomy or radioactive iodine) to present with symptoms of hypothyro idism at later stages of the disease. A diagnostic algorithm for patients with thyroid disease is provided in Figure 68-2. TREATMENT Initial treatment of acutely ill patients with thyroid storm is stabilization, airway protection in cases of altered mental status, monitoring, IV fluids, and cooling blankets. Further treatment targets de novo synthesis of TH, release of TH, and adrenergic hyperactivity. There are 2 main medications that block de novo synthesis of TH: propythiouracil (PTU) and methimazole. Neither of them can be administered IV; they need to be given orally, through a nasogastric tube, or rectally. PTU also has an added advantage of blocking the peripherial con\u00ad version of T4 to T3 To block the release of stored TH, iodine or lithium carbonate can be used, but should be administered at least 1 hour after the initiation of block\u00ad ade of de novo synthesis. Adrenergic blockers are used for symptomatic treatment, propranolol being the medi\u00ad cation of choice. Alternative medications include esmo\u00ad lol, and for patients with contraindications to beta-bloc kers, guanethidine or reserpine. As a part of supportive treatment, IV steroids are used (hydrocorti \u00ad sone or dexameth asone) and acetaminophen for fever. If the patient presents in congesti ve heart failure, they may need diuretics and digoxin for arrhythmia control. Salicylates should not be used, because they in crease the free T4 level. As mentioned before, the precipitating cause should be treated. Outpatient treatment of hyperthyroid patients varies with the cause and may include PTU or methimazole, pro-THYROID EMERGENCIES Clinical suspicion of thyroid disease If uncomplicated thyroid dysfunction, refer \u00b1 initiate treatment If elderly and evidence of end\u00ad organ insufficiency (eg, CHF), admit If thyroid storm/myxedema coma, treat and admit to ICU Figure 68-2. Thyroid emergencies diagnostic algorithm. CHF, congestive heart failure; ICU, care unit; pranolol, radioactive iodine, subtotal thyroidectomy, and occasiona lly steroids. Prompt initiation of supportive treatment for patients presenting in myxedema coma is very important and includes IV fluids, passive rewarming, and possibly pres\u00ad sors and mechanical ventilation. TH should be replaced by IV administration ofT4 (levothyroxin e) or free T3 (liothy\u00ad ronine or triiodothyronine). In severe myxedema coma, T 3 should be given, either combined with T 4 or alone (caution is necessary in patients with myocardial compro\u00ad mise). Administration of IV steroids is routinely recom\u00ad mended. A baseline cortisol level before initiating steroid therapy should be obtained. Uncomplicated hypothyroid patients can be treated with oral replacement therapy using levothyroxi ne. DISPOSITION Admission Admit patients with concomitant illness such as CHF or dysrhyth mia. An ICU setting is indicated for patients with thyroid storm or myxedema coma. Discharge Discharge patients with uncomplicated thyrotoxi cosis or hypothyroidism, with proper instructions, timely referral, and the initiation of treatment.

Nasr, MD Key Points Adrenal crisis is a medical emergency and must be recognized and treated promptly. Administration of steroids, saline, and vasopressors (as needed) should be instituted when adrenal crisis is suspected. INTRODUCTION Cortisol secretion is regulated by adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which, in turn, is regulated by corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) from the hypo\u00ad thalamus. renin\u00ad insufficiency is the failure of the adrenal cortex to produce adequate amounts of cortisol, aldosterone, or both. Primary adrenal insufficienc y (Addison disease) refers to failure of the adrenal gland as a result of tissue destruction, most frequently from an autoimmune process (70o/o of cases). It is uncommon, affecting 100 per 1 million persons. Risk factors for primary adrenal insufficiency include human immunodeficiency virus (HN) infection, metastatic leukemia), infection (bac\u00ad terial, fungal, viral, tuberculo sis), sarcoidosis, or sepsis. HIV infection results in adrenal insufficiency at a much higher rate than in the general population. Up to 25o/o of patients with HIV have inadequa te adrenal reserves. Contributing factors in HIV patients include the human immunodeficiency virus itself, opportunistic infections, and medications. Secondary adrenal insufficiency is due to inadequate production of ACTH from pituitary gland. Cortisol production is decreased; however, aldosterone secretion is usually intact because its production is stimulated to a Adrenal crisis should be considered in the presence of refractory hypotension. The preferred steroid for adrenal insufficiency is dexamethasone because it does not interfere with the cosyntropin stimulation test. much greater extent by angiotensin. Suppress ion of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis by exogenous steroid administration is the most common cause of adrenal insufficienc y. It is based on the dose and duration of treatment. Administrations of steroids for <2 weeks or doses <5 mg per day are unlikely to result in adrenal insufficienc y. Steroid administration (withdrawal ), pituitary tumors, and trauma place patients at risk for secondary adrenal insufficiency. Acute adrenal insufficiency (Addison or adrenal crisis) is an emergent condition that occurs in a person who has underlying adrenal suppression who undergoes an acute stress or illness. Some patients have a history of chronic adrenal insufficiency; for others, adrenal crisis is the initial presentation. Cushing syndrome refers to a situation in which there is a symptomatic excess of glucocorticoids. Prolonged exogenous administration of steroids is the most common cause of Cushing syndrome. Cushing disease is present when Cushing syndrome is due to excessive ACTH secretion from the pituitary gland. Endogenous Cushing syndrome (Cushing disease) is much less common and occurs in 13 per 1 million persons. In addition to exogenous steroid administration, Cushing syndrome is due to an of gland (70%), include 292 ADRENAL EMERGENCIES pancreatic cancer, small-cell lung carcinoma, and carci\u00ad noid tumors. Prolonged steroid administration is a risk factor for exogenous Cushing syndrome. Endogenous (Cushing disease) is more common in women aged 20-40 and in the presence of malignancy (lung, pancreat ic). CLINICAL PRESENTATION History Patients with adrenal insufficiency report complaints of fatigue, nausea, vomitin g, abdomina l pain, lighthead\u00ad edness, or diarrhea, whereas those with Cushing syn\u00ad drome report fatigue, weakness, and menstrual irregulari ties. Physical Examination Patients with primary adrenal insufficiency will present with hyperpigmentation of the skin due to increased levels of circulating ACTH. This finding is present in 98% of these patients. Acute adrenal insufficiency is characterized by mental status changes, hypotension, and tachycardia. Hypothermia may be present, but fever can be seen in the setting of concurrent infection. Physical findings in Cushing syndrome may include truncal obesity, moon facies, buffalo hump, hirsutism, and skin striae. Hypertension is a common finding. DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES Laboratory Laboratory studies in patients with suspected adrenal insufficiency or Cushing syndrome should include complete blood count, electrolytes with glucose, cortisol, and ACTH level. In primary adrenal insufficie ncy, hyponatremia is present in 90% of patients, 64%, hypercalcemia in 6-33%. In secondary adrenal insufficien cy, electrolyte abnormalities are less likely because aldosterone production is not impaired. Anemia is present in 40% of patients, and an elevated white blood cell count suggests infection. Hypoglycemia is present in two thirds of patients. A random serum cortisol level <15 mcg/dL in an acutely ill patient is diagnostic of adrenal insufficiency in most cases and can be performed in the emergency depart\u00ad ment (ED). An ACTH level can be drawn, but results are rarely available in the ED. In Cushing syndrome, hyperglycemia is commonly present and is due to insulin resistance. Hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis is present in some patients with increased ACTH production. A random serum cortisol is not useful due to wide diurnal ranges. The rapid ACTH stimulation test is infrequently performed in the ED, but may be used to test the responsiveness of the adrenal glands. A baseline sample of blood is drawn at time 0 for a cortisol level, then 0.25 mg of cosyntropin (synthetic ACTH) is given intravenously (IV). Plasma cortisol levels are checked at 30 minutes and 1 hour. Dexamet hasone should be given empirically even without waiting for the results. In nor\u00ad mal subjects, baseline cortisol (time 0) levels exceed 5 mcg/dL. Post-rapid ACTH stimulation test, plasma cor\u00ad tisol levels should rise at least? meg/ dL and peak at > 18 mcg/dL, which marks a normal response and rules out primary disorders of the adrenal glands. Subsequent measurement of the plasma ACTH level determines whether adrenal insufficiency is primary (Addison dis\u00ad ease) or secondary. Elevated ACTH levels indicate pri\u00ad mary adrenal insufficienc y, whereas normal or low levels indicate secondary adrenal insufficiency. Imaging Imaging studies are not routinely indicated in adrenal insufficiency or Cushing syndrome. Chest x-ray, electroca rdiogram, or head computed tomography may be useful depending on the clinical presentation (ie, altered mental status, suspected pneumonia or cardiac ischemia) . MEDICAL DECISION MAKING The dif ferential diagnoses for adrenal insufficiency include shock (cardiovascula r, septic), dehydrati on, or influenza infection. Consider adrenal crisis in any patient who presents in shock, especially if they have a history of adrenal insufficienc y, withdrawal of chronic steroids, characteristic electrolyte abnormalities (low Na, high K), or hypoglycemia (Figure 69-1). Acute adrenal insuffi\u00ad ciency is usually precipitated by an underlyi ng illness (eg, sepsis), and it is important for the clinician to iden\u00ad tify and treat both disorders. depressi on, diabetes mellitus, and hypothyro idism are the most common differential diagnoses for Cushing syndrome. TREATMENT IV 0.9 NS should be given to treat hypotension. Persistent hypotension may require vasopressors. Dextrose is admin\u00ad istered in the setting of hypoglycemia. An ampule of D50 is given initially and is repeated as needed. Dexamethasone 4-6 mg IV is given every 6 hours or hydrocortisone 100 mg IV every 8 hours. Dexamethasone is preferred because, unlike hydrocortisone, it does not interfere with cortisol response to ACTH or the cortisol assay. If hydrocortisone is given, results of the ACTH ( cosyntrop in) stimulation test will be difficult to interpret. Mineralocorticoids in the form of fludrocortisone acetate (Florine\u00a3) 0.05-0.2 mg are administered. Search and treat precipitating causes ( eg, sepsis). It is not the role of the emergency physician to make the definitive diagnosis of Cushing syndrome but to suspect the condition, treat the underlying cause, and refer the patient for further testing or treatment.

Oncologic Emergencies Biswadev Mitra, MD Key Points Spinal cord compression should be considered in any patient presenting to the emergency department with a neurologic complaint and a history of malignanc y. Electrolyte abnormalities should be considered in all patients with malignancy and nonsp ecific symptoms. INTRODUCTION Improvements in the management of cancer have lead to an aging population presenting to emergency departments (EDs) with complications related to malignant disease. Oncologic emergencies occur in patients with recurrence of a previously diagnosed malignanc y, complications of cancer treatment, or signs and symptoms that may lead to a new diagnosis of cancer. Emergency clinicians must be aware of the common complications associated with malignancies and available treatments. These complica\u00ad tions can be broadly divided into those created by local tumor effects, complications from hematologic derange\u00ad ments and biochemical abnormalities, and complications related to cancer treatment. When caring for patients with oncologic related emergencies in the ED, consideration should always be given to the nature of medical therapy warranted in view of progression of the disease. Early consultation with family members and stakeholders is advised. Emergencies related to local tumor invasion include spinal cord compression and superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome. Both are oncologic emergencies that require prompt intervention. The most common primary tumors that metastasize to the spine are lung (29%), prostate (19%), and breast (13%). The thoracic spine is the most common site involved (77%). The lumbar spine is affected 29% of Patients undergoing chemotherapy who present with fever should be considered neutropenic until proven otherwise. the time with the cervical (12%) and sacral (7%) regions being affected least often. SVC syndrome is defined as obstruction of flow through the superior vena cava due to tumor-related compression. Lung cancer and non-Hodgkin lymphoma together cause about 95% of cancer-related SVC syndrome. The incidence of SVC syndrome in patients with lung cancer and non\u00ad Hodgkin lymphoma is 2-4%. Thrombosis related to central venous catheters can also cause SVC syndrome in patients with cancer as a result of their prothrombotic state. Emergencies related to biochemical derangements in the cancer patient include hypercalcemia and tumor lysis syndrome. Hypercalcemia has been reported to occur in 20-30% of patients with cancer at some time during the course of their disease. It occurs most commonly in can\u00ad cers associated with bone (multiple myeloma), bony metastasis (breast, lung, prostate, renal), or cancers that secrete parathyroid-like substance (lung) or osteoclastic factors (lymphomas ). The detection of hypercalcemia in a patient with cancer signifies a very poor prognosis, with death often occurring within months. Tumor lysis syndrome is the most common disease\u00ad related emergency encountered in patients with hematologic cancers. The syndrome occurs when tumor cells release their contents into the bloodstream, either spontaneously or in response to therapy, leading to the characteristic findings of hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and 295 CHAPTER 70 hypocalcemia. These electrolyte and metabolic disturbances can progress to clinical toxic effects, including renal ins uffi\u00ad ciency, cardiac arrhythmias, seizures, and death due to organ failure. It is most common in cancers with high cell turnover (leukemia and lymph oma). One of the most common hematologic emergencies is neutropenic fever, which is the presence of a fever >38\u00b0C with an absolute neutrophil count of <500/!lL. Febrile neu\u00ad tropenia is a result of bone marrow suppression, a common side effect of chemothe rapy. Patients with neutropenia are susceptible to life-threatening bacterial infections. Older age has been shown to be an independent risk factor for the development of neutropenia and febrile neutropenia. A neutropenia and neutropenic fever. CLINICAL PRESENTATION ..... History Pain is the presenting symptom of spinal cord compression in 90-95% of patients. The pain is usually constant and close to the site of the lesion. Patients complain of a band or girdle of pain/tightness radiating from back to front, exacerbated by recumbenc y, movement, coughing and sneezing. Symptoms may include numbness and tingling, which usually precedes weakness. Weakness often presents with \"stiffness, \" dragging of a limb, or unsteadiness. Facial edema is the most common symptom of SVC syndrome with patients often describing feeling bloated. Other symptoms include dyspnea, cough, chest and shoul\u00ad der pain, and hoarseness. Dyspnea may be worse when leaning forward or lying down. Arm swelling and lymph\u00ad edema are other common symptoms of SVC syndrome. In both acute and chronic hypercalcemia of malig\u00ad nancy, the major manifestations affect gastrointestinal, renal, and neuromuscular function. Patients with acute hypercalcemia commonly present with anorexia, nausea, vomiting, polyuria, polydipsia, dehydrati on, weakness, and confusion. Patients with tumor lysis syndrome may have similar symptoms often related to acute renal failure. Neutropenic patients, usually on chemothe rapy, often present to the ED with fever and no clear source of infec\u00ad tion. Tachycardia and hypotension may accompany fever and may indicate severe sepsis or septic shock. Weakness and dehydration are usually present. ..... Physical Examination Patients with cancer who present to the ED require a thor\u00ad ough physical examination to identify potential life threats associated with malignanc y. Vital signs and general assess\u00ad ment including mental status will often reveal whether an acute medical emergency such as neutropenic sepsis or arrhythmia exists. A thorough head-to-toe examination should follow. Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examina\u00ad tion should assess for a patent airway, oropharyngeal infection, facial plethora, and cranial neuropathies. Neck examination should assess for cervical spine tenderness and dilated neck veins. Cardiovascular and respiratory exams should assess breath sounds and cardiac rhythm. Decreased breath sounds or distant heart sounds may indicate pleural or pericardia! effusions. Abdominal exam should assess for masses and possible source of occult infection. Back exam should assess for any localized tenderness or masses, and neurologic exam should identify any focal neurologic defi\u00ad cits. Extremities and skin should be assessed for hydration status and edema, possibly related to acute renal failure. DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES ..... Electrocardiogram An electrocardiogram should be performed in all patients with suspected electrolyte abnormalities. Patients with hyper\u00ad calcemia may have a shortened QT interval due to the increased rate of cardiac repolarization. Arrhythmias such as bradycardia and first -degree atrioventricular block may occur. Tumor lysis syndrome may result in multiple electrolyte abnormalities that may manifest as arrhythmias. Hyperkalemia may demonstrate a spectrum from peaked T waves, PR and QRS prolongation, loss of P-wave and T-wave flattening, and finally a sine wave. Hypocalcemia causes a prolonged QT and may result in ventricular arrhythmias. ..... Laboratory Serum metabolic panel (BMP) with calcium, magne\u00ad sium, and phosphorous should be assessed on all patients with vague complaints, vomiting, or dehydrati on. BMP should also be ordered for those at risk for hypercalcemia (bony metastasis) and tumor lysis syndrome (recent cancer treatment). Patients with tumor lysis syndrome present with acute renal failure in the presence of hyperuricemia (> 15 mg/dL), hyperphosphatemia (>8 mg/dL), hyperkale\u00ad mia, and hypocalcemia. A complete blood count should be obtained on all patients to assess for neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count <500/!lL), anemia, and thrombocytope\u00ad nia. The absolute neutrophil count is determined by mul\u00ad tiplying the total white blood cell count times the percentage of neutrophils plus bands. Multiple sets of blood cultures and a urine culture should be collected in all febrile neutropenic patients in the ED. ..... Imaging Patients with signs or symptoms suggestive of spinal cord metastasis should have their spine imaged. Plain radio\u00ad graphs may identify bony metastasis or pathologic fractures but are not sufficiently sensitive to rule out the presence of spinal disease. Computed tomography ( CT) scan of the spine is more sensitive than plain films; however, magnetic resonance imaging of the spine is the test of choice to assess for spinal metastasis and cord involvement. Similarly, chest radiograph may be used as an initial test for patients with suspected SVC syndrome, but CT chest with contrast is the test of choice for identification. ONCOLOGIC EMERGENCI ES MEDICAL DECISION MAKING Identification of common emergencies associated with malignant disease is key to the expeditious ED care of the cancer patient. Patients with acute shortness of breath should be assessed for malignant pleural or pericardia! effu\u00ad sions or pulmonary embolus. Generalized weakness may be from dehydration, electrolyte abnormalities associated with tumor lysis syndrome or renal failure, or an occult infection owing to immunosuppression from chemothera py. Brain or spinal cord metastasis should be considered for any focal neurologic sign or symptom, and appropriate imaging should be performed in the ED (Figure 70-1). TREATMENT For patients with acute spinal cord compression from spinal metastasis, IV corticosteroids relieve pain, reduce edema, and may improve neurologic function. They may also tern-porarily prevent the onset of cord ischemia. Radiation therapy provides more definitive treatment in most patients. Indications for radiation therapy include known radiosen\u00ad sitive tumor with no spinal instability and palliative therapy in patients who present with paraplegia. SVC syndrome is treated in the ED with IV steroids (dexamethasone 10 mg IV) and furosemide IV in an attempt to reduce venous pressures. Patients with cardiac or respiratory compromise or central nervous system dysfunction may require emergent endotracheal intuba\u00ad tion or radiation therapy. Vascular sulted for possible SVC stenting. Hypercalcemia is treated in the ED with IV fluid administration. Levels > 13 mg/ dL usually require treatment. An initial bolus of 1-2 L of normal saline (NS) is initiated. Loop diuretics (furosemide) can also be given in a dose of 40-80 mg IV. Bisphosphonates may also be used, but their maximum effect does not occur for 2-4 days. Hemodialysis may be indicated in severe cases.

Hyperkalemia remains the most dangerous component lysis syndrome, causing life-threatening dysrhyth rnias. Hemodia lysis may be needed in patients with renal failure, severe electrolyte abnormalities, or fluid overload. If not treated in the first 48 hours, the mortality for neutropenic sepsis approaches 50%. The prompt adminis\u00ad tration of empiric antibiotic therapy has resulted in a decrease in mortality to 10%. Neutropenic fever should be treated expeditiously with ceftazidirne 2 g IV. Vancomycin should be added for patients with sepsis, known methicil\u00ad lin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, or indwelling venous catheters. DISPOSITION ..... Admission Patients with acute spinal cord compression will often require intensive care unit (ICU) admission for frequent neurologic evaluation. Neutropenic patients may also require an ICU if they have signs of sepsis or septic shock. If admitted to the floor, they should have reverse isolation precautions to protect them from hospital acquired infec\u00ad tions. Patients with renal failure or severe electrolyte abnormalities will require an ICU or telemetry moni\u00ad tored bed. ..... Discharge Cancer patients with a febrile illness who are not neutrope\u00ad nic may be considered for discharge depending on the source of the fever. Patients with mild dehydration and correctable electrolyte abnormalities may also be consid\u00ad ered for discharge. SUGGESTED READING Blackburn P. Emergency complications of malignancy.

Kontrick, MD Key Points Control pain aggressively. Search for and treat the precipitants of pain crisis. INTRODUCTION Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited chronic disease found primarily in those of African, Middle Eastern, Indian, or Mediterranean ancestry. SCD is characterized by a defect in the hemoglobin molecule, which normally con\u00ad sists of two pairs of a and p globin. A single amino acid substitution (valine for glutamine) on the P-globin gene results in sickle hemoglobin (Hb S). The mutation that causes the amino acid substitution is inherited as an auto\u00ad somal recessive trait. Patients with sickle cell trait have one abnormal P-globin gene (heterozygous HbAS), whereas those with SCD have 2 P-globin (homozy\u00ad gous HbSS). During states of biologic stress (eg, low 02 state, infection, dehydration, pregnancy, cold exposure, trauma) the Hb S polymerizes, resulting in deformation (sickling) of the red blood cell (RBC). This sickled RBC has reduced ability to pass through small blood vessels, result\u00ad ing in vasoocclu sion, hemolysis, and end-organ damage. Premature destruction of the sickled RBC results in a shorter than normal life span of the cell. Two million people in the United States have sickle cell trait, and 70,000 have sickle cell disease. Although survival has improved dramatically recently, life expectancy of patients with SCD is shorter than average, now just greater than 50 years. Most patients with SCD present to the emergency department (ED) with either a painful vase occlusive crisis Complications of sickle cell disease, both typical and atypical, must be aggressively sought after and treated. Have a low threshold for admission when patients may have an occult infection. or sequela from vase-occlusion, some of which may be life\u00ad threateni ng. It is the role of the emergency physician to not only control pain but also diagnose and treat potential life threats. Acute sickle cell emergencies can be divided into several classifications: acute pain crisis, acute chest syn\u00ad drome, infection, neurologic, sequestration, aplas\u00ad tic and priapism. ..... Acute Pain Crisis Vase-occlusive pain crises account for approximately 90% of ED visits. Severe back and extremity pain results from micro\u00ad infarction of the bones and joints. Abdominal pain crises result from ischemia to the mesenter y, spleen, and liver. ..... Acute Chest Syndrome Acute chest syndrome is the most common cause of death in patients with SCD. Although it is more common in children, it is more severe in adults. Acute chest syndrome is characterized by fever, chest pain, respiratory symp\u00ad toms, hypoxia, and an infiltrate seen on chest x-ray (CJCR). It is a result of pulmonary ischemia and infarc\u00ad tion. Acute chest is frequently a complication of pneumo\u00ad nia. Chlamydia and Mycoplasma are the 2 most common organisms, but viruses, Streptococcus pneumoni ae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Haemophilus influenzae are all potential causes. 299 CHAPTER 71 ..... Infection Patients with SCD are at increased risk of infection as a result of the loss of splenic function secondary to recurrent splenic infarcts. Children as young as 6 months of age may be functionally asplenic, and most patients with SCD are by the age of 5 or 6 years. This makes them more vulnera\u00ad ble to infections with encapsulated organisms such as S. pneumoni ae and H. influenzae.S. aureus, Escherichia coli, and Salmonella typhimurium are also common pathogens. Bone, pulmona ry, and central nervous system (CNS) infections are common and must be considered in any febrile patient with SCD. ..... Neurologic Patients with SCD are at increased risk for cerebrovascular accident (CVA), ischemic and hemorrhagic, as well ass ub\u00ad arachnoid hemorrhage. Approximately 10% of patients will have a CVA by the age of 20 years. Vasoocclusion, as well as endothelial damage, are believed to play a role in development of CVA. ..... Splenic Sequestration The abnormal sickled cells become trapped in the spleen (splenic sequestrati on), leading to a rapid decrease in steady state hemoglobin and an enlarged spleen. A rapid decrease in hemoglobin can lead to hemodynamic instabil\u00ad ity and altered mental status. Splenic sequestration is a serious complication seen more commonly in children than adults and carries a significant morbidity and mortal\u00ad ity potential. ..... Aplastic Crisis Aplastic crisis arises when bone marrow production of RBCs stops or falls below the rate of destruction. Aplastic crisis is also associated with reticulocytopenia. Aplastic crisis in patients with SCD has been linked to infection with parvovirus as well as folic acid deficienc y. ..... Hemolytic Anemia Chronic hemolysis is a problem for all patients with SCD due to the deformed RBC. Hemoglobin levels range from 6-9 g/dL. Patients will also have an increased reticulocyte count due to increase RBC destruction. Under stress (eg, infection), hemolysis rates may increase and patients my have a decrease in hemoglobin from their baseline. ..... Priapism Priapism, a painful failure of penile detumescence second\u00ad ary to corpus cavernosum obstruction by sickled cells, has a bimodal peak (5-13 years and 21-29 years of age). Prolonged priapism can lead to impotence due to fibrosis and vascular damage. CLINICAL PRESENTATION ..... History Patients will present with pain that is usually moderate to severe and most commonly involves the extremities, back, chest, and abdomen. Important historical considerations include possible precipitants, previous complica tions, home analgesic regimen, and routine medical care. Common precipitants of a pain crisis include infection, cold, and dehydrat ion. Determine whether the patient's pain is typical or atypical in relation to previous episodes in an effort to determine whether more than a simple vasooc\u00ad clusive pain crisis is occurring. The presence of fever, chest pain, shortness of breath, joint swelling, or redness should prompt the clinician to look beyond a simple pain crisis. ..... Physical Examination Note the presence of abnormal vital signs (VS), particu\u00ad larly fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypoxia and hypoten\u00ad sion, which may indicate complications of SCD or another acute process. Although most patients with an acute vase\u00ad occlusive crisis will have a low-grade temperature, a fever greater than 38.3\u00b0C (100.9 F) should prompt a search for an infectious precipitant. In addition, acute chest syn\u00ad drome should be suspected in patients with chest pain, shortness of breath, fever, and cough. Determination of hydration status is critical. Rehydrating the patient in crisis not only reduces sickling of the cells, but also increases the intravascular volume, thereby helping to relieve vasoocclu\u00ad sion. In addition to rapid and accurate VS measurements and determination of hydration status, several key organ systems must be assessed . The general appearance of the patient should be noted for signs of respiratory distress, physical pain, and lethargy. Because of the increased rate of hemolysis, patients with SCD may have jaundice or scleral icterus. Pallor may indi\u00ad cate a significant drop in hemoglobin. The skin should be examined for signs of infection. Pallor, left upper quadrant pain, and splenomegaly are all concerning for splenic sequestration. Chest auscultation should be done to note any rales, rhonchi, or wheezing. The abdominal exam should note the presence of focal tenderness, especially the right or left upper quadrants. The presence of splenomeg\u00ad aly or hepatomega ly, or the presence of guarding or rebound tenderness, should alert the practitioner to an intra-abdominal process beyond that associated with pain crisis. Extremities and joints should be examined for focal tenderness, joint erythema, or swelling, all of which may indicate osteomyelitis or septic arthritis and not simply bone pain associated with a crisis. Patients with SCD require a thorough examination of the extremities, and it should be performed on an undressed patient to rule out these serious complications. A full neurologic exam includ\u00ad ing cranial nerves and cerebellar signs should be per\u00ad formed to assess for any new neurologic deficits in a patient with acute complaints. SICKLE CELL EMERGENCIES DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES ..... Laboratory Initial laboratory studies in patients suspected of having vasa\u00ad occlusive crisis include complete blood count and reticulocyte count. The Hb level is usually between 6 and 9 g!dL, but should be compared with previous levels for any acute decreases that would be consistent with rapid hemolysis, splenic sequestration, or aplastic crisis. The reticulocyte count should be elevated during a typical acute vasoocc lusive pain crisis to compensate for increased RBC turnover. A reticulo\u00ad cyte count less than 2% would be concerning for aplastic cri\u00ad sis. Leukocytosis (12-20 K/mm) is common and does not necessarily indicate infection. Infection should not be excluded solely on the basis of white blood cell (WBC) count. Liver function tests are indicated in patients with abdominal pain or jaundice to further evaluate evidence of hemolysis, gall bladder, or liver end-organ damage. Urinalysis is needed to assess for infection as a precipitant for the acute pain crisis. Blood and urine cultures are only needed in patients in whom infection is suspected. .... Imaging Several imaging modalities can aid in the diagnosis of severe sequela of vasoocclusi ve crises. When fever or res pi\u00ad ratory signs or symptoms are present, a chest x-ray should be obtained to assess for signs of infection or infarction. Should pulmonary embolus be suspected, a helical con\u00ad trast computed tomography (CT) can be performed. Patients with significant abdominal pain should undergo abdominal imaging to search for evidence of gallbladder or liver infarction or infection. Patients with new neurologic symptoms or signs should have aCT scan of the brain to assess for possible CVA. PROCEDU RES An exchange transfusion is used to reduce vasoocclusion; the abnormal Hb is removed and replaced with normal donor blood. It is used during certain crises such as stroke and priapism when the hematocrit is greater than 35%. The procedure involves removing 500 mL (adult) through one intravenous (IV) line while simultaneously infusing 500 mL of normal saline (NS) through a second. After blood is removed the patient is given one unit of donor blood. MEDICAL DECISION MAKING The differential diagnosis associated with sickle cell vasa\u00ad occlusive crisis is broad. It includes acute chest, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism (PE), myocardial infarction (MI), cellulitis, osteomyelitis, and septic arthritis. The clinician must differentiate a simple pain crisis from one of these potential life threats. A high level of suspicion must be maintained in each case. Bone and joint pain during a pain crisis does not usually present with limited range of motion. When joint range of motion deficits are present, the physician should be prompted to search for osteomyelitis or septic arthritis. Although an elevated WBC may be typical of a sickle cell pain crisis, a left shift would be more concerning for infection and necessitates a closer evaluation for an infectious process. A high index of suspicion for infection is always warranted. Localized left upper quadrant pain could indicate splenic infarction, whereas right upper quadrant pain may indicate cholecysti \u00ad tis. Electrocardiogram (ECG) findings consistent with acute MI or ischemia (ST-segment elevation, hyperacute T waves, T-wave inversions, ST-segment depression) should prompt further cardiac evaluati on. Patients whose chest pain is atypical for their pain crisis and who also exhibit vital sign abnormalities or signs of right heart strain on the ECG should be evaluated for PE. Patients with altered mental sta\u00ad tus should be evaluated for severe anemia due to splenic sequestration, meningitis, CVA/transient ischemic attack (TIA), or seizure disorder (Figure 71-1). TREATMENT Any identifiable preCipitants of pain crisis should be treated. Even if the patient does not appear dehydrated, fluids should be replaced. If unable to tolerate oral fluids, 5% dextrose with 0.45% NS is the fluid of choice for fluid replacement. NS boluses are reserved for the hypovolemic patient. A simple blood transfusion is indicated in patients with symptomatic anemia, sequestration crisis, hemolysis, or aplastic crisis. Exchange transfusion should be consid\u00ad ered in severe vaso-occlusive crises such as acute chest syndrome, stroke, or priapism, where the Hgb level is > 10. ..... Pain Crises Treatment should begin with prompt analgesic administra\u00ad tion. Supplemental oxygen is needed only for patients with low oxygen saturations or those with oxygen saturations lower than baseline. Mild pain should be treated with 1 g of acetaminophen by mouth (PO) every4 hours (children: 15 mg/kg/dose PO), 800 mg (children: mg/kg/dose) PO every 8 hours. IV or intramuscular ketorolac has been shown to be effec\u00ad tive with limitations in dosing frequen cy. Opiates are first\u00ad line therapy for a moderate to severe pain crisis. Morphine (0.1-0.15 mg/kg/dose) and dramine is often required to blunt histamine\u00ad induced pruritus resulting from opiate administration . .... Infection Antibiotics should be used for patients with suspected infection ( eg, those with suspected meningitis, urinary tract infection, acute chest syndrome, or osteomyelit is). .... Anemia Transfusion should be considered for symptomatic anemia and is generally indicated in cases in which the hemoglobin CHAPTER 71 CT head: CVA? Figure 71-1. with an inappropr iately low reticulocyte count. An acute crisis (acute chest, stroke, liver/gall bladder infarction, priapism) with hemoglobin <10 g/dL also mer\u00ad transfusi on. With regard to aplastic crisis, simple trans\u00ad fusion is often sufficient. Splenic sequestration is best treated with adequate hydration, analgesia, and simple transfusion. Refractory cases are treated with exchange transfusion. ..... Acute Chest Syndrome Control pain, hydrate, and start oxygen therapy. Give empiric antibiotics consisting of a third-generation cepha\u00ad losporin and a macrolide (eg, ceftriaxone and for transfusion should include a Pa02 <70 mmHg or an oxygen saturation that falls >10% from their baseline. ..... Stroke Patients with stroke related to SCD are not considered candidates for thrombolysis. Correction of hypovolemia, hypoxia, hypoglycemia, and fever are necessary. Exchange transfusion should be performed in an effort to reduce the percent of HbS to <30%. Hemorrhagic strokes warrant transfuse (refractory cases). After 4-6 hours of priapism and failure of ice packing, drainage may be necessary. Drainage should be done in conjunction with urologic consultation . DISPOSITION ..... Admission Criteria for admission include refractory pain, acute chest syndrome, CVA or TIA, unexplained fever >38.3\u00b0C or focal infection, aplastic crisis, splenic sequestration, or refrac\u00ad tory priapism . ..... Discharge If the patient's pain is well controlled and good outpatient follow-up is available, he or she may be discharged. SICKLE CELL EMERGENCIES SUGGESTED READING Baker M, Hafner JW.

Transfusion Reactions Christopher Reverte, MD jorge Fernandez, MD Key Points Obtain consent when possible before administering blood transfusions and properly inform patients regarding the risk of developing complications. Always transfuse leukocyte-reduced blood products to recipients who are immunocompromised to prevent graft versus host disease. It may be difficult to clinically distinguish between benign (urticaria, simple febrile reactions) and more INTRODUCTION Emergency transfusion of blood products is often necessary in the emergency department (ED) for life-threatening illness or injuries. Commonly transfused blood products include packed red blood cells (PRBCs), platelets, fresh\u00ad frozen plasma (FFP), and cryoprecipitate. In the United States, approximately 30 million units of blood components are transfused annually. Approximately 1% of patients receiving transfusions will develop a transfusion-related reaction, the most common being a simple febrile reaction. Transfusion reactions must be rapidly identified to prevent morbidity and mortality. Acute intravascular hemolysis is due to ABO blood group incompa tibility between the donor and recipient. Preformed antibodies in the patient's serum react with antigens comple\u00ad ment-media ted intravascular RBC lysis. Patients present with chest pain, shortness of breath, back pain, fever, tachycardia, or shock. Complications include acute renal failure, disseminated intravascular coagulopa thy (DIC), cardiovascular collapse, and death. Delayed extravascular hemolysis is due to non-ABO blood group incompatibility between the donor and recipient. serious transfusion reactions (acute hemolysis, anaphylaxis, transfusion-associated acute lung injury, sepsis). Whenever a transfusion reaction is suspected, immediately stop the transfusion, confirm that the correct blood product was administered to the correct recipient, and send samples of the transfused product and the recipient's serum to the blood bank for further analysis. This type of hemolysis is the result of splenic removal of RBCs, which may present days to weeks after the transfusion and in general is not life-threatening. Simple febrile reaction is the most common type of transfusion- related reaction, occurring in about 1-7% of all transfusions. It is caused by recipient antibodies to donor leukocytes. The risk is minimized by leukoreduction. Patients present with fever without urticaria, bronchospasm, or shock. Type I hypersensitivity reactions include urticaria and anaphylaxi s. Urticaria is the result of a mild reaction due to recipient antibodies to donor blood. Patients present with hives and pruritus without fever, bronchospasm, or shock. Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening reaction seen most com\u00ad manly in immunoglobulin A (IgA)-deficient individuals who are transfused IgA-containing blood. Patients rapidly develop fever, airway obstruction, bronchospasm, urticaria, and/or shock. Transfusion-associated acute lung injury (TRALI) may result in a life-threatening noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. It is associated with anti-HLA antibodies (higher rates in pregnant donors). It most commonly occurs after plasma transfusion but can occur from transfusion of any type of plasma-containing blood product (including 304 TRANSFUSION REACTIONS PRBC, platelets, cryoprecipitate, etc). Signs and symptoms include fever, severe respiratory distress, noncardiogenic pulmonary edema and cardiovascular collapse. Infectious complications to transfusion may be bacterial or viral. Bacterial infections are more common after platelet transfusion (stored at room temperature ) and longer blood storage times. Organisms are most commonly skin or gastrointestinal flora. Diagnosis requires positive cultures from donor and recipient blood. Donor blood is prescreened for human immuno defi\u00ad ciency virus (HIV), hepatitis B (HBV), virus (HCV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), human West Nile virus (WNV), and parvovirus; neverthel ess, there is a small risk of trans\u00ad mission of these pathogens (most commonly HCV) despite screening. Massive transfusions put the patient at risk for develop\u00ad ing when >4 PRBCs are transfused within 1 hour or 10 units within 12 hours, without the addition of clotting factors or platelets. Hypocalcemia and metabolic alkalosis may ocur due to the effect of citrate. Volume overload from transfusiOns is more common in the setting of underlying chronic cardiac or kidney disease as well as plasma transfusion. Patients pres\u00ad ent with acute pulmonary edema without fever or shock. Graft-ver sus-host disease is a rare complication of transfusion seen in irnmunoc ompromised or familial recipients. It is associated with a very high mortality rate. Donor T lymphocytes attack recipient tissues. This compli\u00ad cation is prevented by leukoreduction and irradiation. Patients may present with fever, rash, pneumonitis, abdom\u00ad inal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, transaminitis, and thrombo\u00ad cytopenia. The incidence of transfusion- related complications is highlighted in Table 72-1.

Chest pain, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, or syncope may be seen in the same condi\u00ad tions. Isolated shortness of breath during transfusion is sug\u00ad gestive of volume overload, whereas generalized prurius d rash (in the absence of other symptoms) suggests urt1car1a. Risk factors for developing a transfusion- related reaction include immunocompromised recipients, those requiring massive transfusion, a history of receiving blood transfu\u00ad sions, preexisting congestive heart failure, or elderly patients. For example, recipients who are irnmunocompromised are at increased risk for graft-ver sus-host disease. Patients receiving massive transfusions are at significant risk for hypothermia and coagulop athy. Elderly patients or patients with congestive heart failure are at risk for pulmonary edema, particularly when blood products are transfused too rapidly. Also, patients who have been transfused blood prod\u00ad ucts in the past are at increased risk of having preexisting antibodies, which may cause a variety of transfusion-r elated reactions. See the Introduction for classic presentations. Physical Examination During transfusion, patients should be monitored closely for adverse reactions. New vital sign abnormalities that develop such as fever, hypotension, tachycardia, or tachy\u00ad pnea are all concerning for possible transfusion reaction. Even well-appearing patients who develop fever during transfusion should have the transfusion stopped and be closely monitored for more serious reactions, as they may quickly decompensa te. In patients with hypotension, tachycardia, or tachypnea, it is difficult to distinguish ongoing hemorrhage (the underlying reason for many transfusio ns) from potentially life-threatening transfusion reactions including acute intravascular hemolysis, anaphy\u00ad laxis, or sepsis. Classically, hypovolemic shock will cause cool extremities, whereas the shock states seen in acute intravascular hemolysis, anaphylaxis, or sepsis cause car\u00ad diovascular collapse and warm extremiti es. Patients receiv\u00ad ing massive transfusions are at risk of hypothermia, whih also may occur due to sepsis. Wheezing may be noted m anaphylaxis or pulmonary edema (due to volume overload or TRALI). Hives or rash is seen in anaphylaxis or urticaria. Dark pink or brown urine indicate hemoglobinuria after acute intravascular hemolysis. DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES Laboratory Laboratory studies are performed to document appropriate response to transfusion ( eg, rise in hemoglobin ) and to aid in identifying acute intravascular hemolysis, sepsis, or CHAPTER 72 other symptoms that develop acutely during a transfusion. Transfusions should always be held pending these results, and the laboratory should be notified to test samples of both donor and recipient blood. Most hospitals have protocols to ensure that the correct blood is transfused to the correct patient and to manage a possible transfu\u00ad sion reaction. Basic laboratory tests are generally not helpful in acute febrile reactions, urticaria, anaphylaxis, TRALI, or volume overload. Their utility in the ED is in identifying acute intravascular hemolysis or sepsis. In acute hemolytic reactions, complete blood count (CBC) may reveal worsening anemia and schistocytes. Other laboratory findings include a positive Coombs test, acute renal failure, DIC, and/or elevated haptoglobin, bilirubin, and lactate dehydrogenase levels. Hemoglobinuria may be seen on urinalysis. If sepsis is suspected, Gram stain and blood cultures should be ordered. CBC may reveal leukocyto sis or leukopenia; however, sepsis cannot be ruled out definitely in their absence. Transfusion During massive transfusion, dilutional ..... Imaging In suspected cases of TRALI or volume overload, a chest x-ray may demonstrate acute pulmonary edema. In general, patientswithvolumeoverloadwillhavecardiomega ly,whereas patients with TRALI will have a normal-heart size. Bedside ultrasound may help differentiate volume overload from TRALI. Volume overload is associated with poor cardiac contractility and inferior vena cava distension, whereas in TRALI, both of those features would be normal. MEDICAL DECISION MAKING Different transfusion reactions present similarly; however, it is important to differentiate which type of reaction is occurring to appropria tely direct treatment and disposi\u00ad tion (Figure 72-1). If there is any suspicion of a transfusion reaction, the first step is to stop the transfusion. Sign or symptom of a transfusion reaction Acute hemolytic reaction Stop the transfusion Fever only Simple febrile reaction Shortness of breath Pulmonary edema TRALI or fluid Hypotension, wheezes, rash, pruritus Allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) Figure 72-1. Transfusion reactions diagnostic algorithm. TRANSFUSION REACTIONS If the patient experiences a fever with no other signs or symptoms, a simple febrile reaction is likely. However, it may be difficult clinically to distinguish between other causes of fever during transfusions, including acute intravascular hemolysis, sepsis, or TRALI. The differential for hypotension during transfusion includes ongoing hemorrhage, hemolytic transfusion reaction, anaphylaxis, sepsis from bacterial contamination, and TRALI. Shortness of breath is seen in anaphylaxis, hemolytic transfusion reaction, volume overload, TRALI, and sepsis. Wheezing may be noted in anaphylaxis, volume overload, or TRALI. Anaphylaxis is often associated with urticaria (unlike acute intravascular hemolysis or sepsis) and usually is not associated with fever. Volume overload or TRALI may present with isolated shortness of breath, pulmonary edema, and/or hypoxia without other systemic findings such as fever or hypotension. A high index of suspicion and broad differential is required in all cases, particularly when the patient experiences any new symptom in the setting of current or recent transfusion. TREATMENT When blood products are being transfused, they should be administered at a slow rate for the first 30 minutes to allow for early identification of a possible reaction. If a transfusion reac\u00ad tion is suspected, the first step is to immediately STOP the transfusion. Check the labels on the blood products and patient, and send blood samples from both the patient and the blood products to the blood bank for further analysis. Treatment modalities for each individual type of reaction follow. Acute intravascular hemolysis. Stop the transfusion immediately. Resuscitate volume aggressively with crystalloid intravenous (IV) fluid. Administer diuretics to maintain urine output 1-2 mL/kg/hr. Vasopressors should be initiated if hypotension is refractory to IV fluids. Send blood and urine specimens to the lab per hospital protocol. Anaphylaxis. Stop the transfusion immedia tely. Rapidly resuscitate with crystalloid mg muscularly (IM), IV, diphen\u00ad 50 mg IV, famotidine 20 mg IV, and albuterol 5 mg in 3 mL of saline nebulizer. Repeat epinephrine as needed, and consider starting an epinephrine drip if necessary. Sepsis. Stop the transfusion immediately. Pan-culture the patient and treat with copious crystalloid IV fluids, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and vasopressors as needed for refractory hypotension. Follow the appropriate sepsis protocol at your institution. TRALI. Stop the transfusion immediately. Administer oxygen and gently diurese. Many patients require noninvasive positive pressure ventilation, and severe cases may require intubation and mechanical ventilation. Massive transfusion coagulopathy. Administer FFP and platelets to reverse coagulopathy and thrombocytope\u00ad nia. Some hospitals have protocols in massive PRBC transfusi on that include platelets and FFP in fixed ratios. Treat hypothermia by warming all blood products to room temperature, coadministration of warm crystalloid IV fluid, and external rewarming measures such as warming blankets. Treat hypocalcemia with IV calcium gluconate. Simple febrile reaction. Stop the transfusion. Treat with antipyretics such as acetaminophen. Restart the transfusion only after ruling out acute hemolysis or sepsis from bacterial contamination. Urticaria. Treat with an antihistamine such as diphenhydramine, and consider a short course of steroids if the rash is severe. The transfusion does not need to be stopped if isolated urticaria occurs, without fever or anaphylaxi s. Delayed extravascular hemolysis. Usually no specific treatment is required; often observed as outpatient. Graft -versus-host disease. Bone marrowtransplantation is the only effective treatment. Prevention is the most useful strategy by transfusing leukocyte-reduced blood in immu\u00ad nocompromised or related recipients. DISPOSITION Admission Patients with persistent vital sign abnormalities or ongoing hemorrhage require admission to a monitored setting in a telemetry or intensive care unit. Addition ally, any patients with findings of intravascular hemolysis, anaphylaxis, sepsis, TRALI, massive transfusion reactions, or volume overload should be admitted to a monitored setting. Discharge Although many patients receiving blood transfusions in the ED already require admission, hemodynamically stable patients without ongoing hemorrh age may be safely discharged home in the absence of a transfusion reaction. Patients who experience a simple febrile reaction or urticarial rash may require a period of observation, but can still be discharged safely in most circumstances.

Anticoagulant Therapy and Its Complications joanne C. Witsil, PharmD Key Points In the anticoagulated patient, have a low threshold to obtain imaging studies after trauma. When initiating warfarin therapy, coadministration with heparin or low-molecular -weight is necessary to avoid a paradoxical hypercoagulable state. INTRODUCTION Use of anticoagulation therapy and complications related to their usage are frequently encountered in the emergency department (ED). Anticoagulant therapies commonly seen include heparin, etexilate. These agents are used frequently in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), venous thromboembolism (VTE), valve replacement, and atrial fibrillation (AF). When administered in the appropriate clinical setting, anticoagulant medications prevent mor\u00ad bidity and mortality. For example, the risk of stroke in patients with AF and structural heart disease is 5% a year but is reduced by 70% with the use of chronic oral antico\u00ad agulation therapy. Anticoagulants are not without complications, how\u00ad ever. In patients taking warfarin, up to 15% will suffer a bleeding complication, 4.9% will develop a major bleeding complication, and approximately 1 o/o will develop a fatal complication annually. The risk of a bleeding complication from heparin use is approximately 6% and is no different than the risk of bleeding from LMWH. Heparin is a mixture of glycosaminoglycan chains of varying lengths that binds to antithrombin III, resulting in inhibition of thrombin and coagulation factors II, IX, X, XI, and XII. LMWH is prepared from unfractionated When the international normalized ratio (INR) is supratherapeutic in a patient who is not bleeding, a cau\u00ad tious approach to vitamin K administration is important. Administering excess vitamin K may overcorrect the INR, leaving the patient refractory to further anticoagulation. heparin and includes only short chains. LMWH binds to antithrombin III but inhibits only factor X. LMWH is advantageous because it has a more predictable dose response and greater bioavailability. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is due to immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody that binds platelets and results in their activation, creating both thrombocytopenia and thrombosis. Typically, the onset of HIT is generally 5-12 days after onset of therapy. The incidence of HIT is 1-3% in patients treated with unfractionated heparin, but is much less common in patients taking LMWH. Warfarin inhibits the cofactor of vitamin K, which nor\u00ad mally allows for the production of anticoagulants (protein C and S) and coagulants (factors II, VII, IX, and X). Because protein C has a half-life that is much shorter than the half\u00ad life of factors II, VII, IX, and X, a hypercoagulable state is seen first, necessitating the coadministration of unfraction\u00ad ated or LMWH until warfarin has reached full anticoagu\u00ad lant potential after 5 days. Dabigatran etexilate directly and competitively binds to free and clot-bound thrombin, which prevents further clot formation. CLINICAL PRESENTATION ..... History Consider the reason the patient has presented to the ED as it relates to their anticoagulant use. 308 ANTICOAGULANT THERAPY AND ITS COMPLICATIONS Gastrointestinal ( GI) bleeding is a common complication and may not be noticed by the patient; therefore, inquire about blood in the stool or melena. Any history of trauma, especially head trauma, should be taken very seriously in the patient on anticoagulant medicatio ns. Intracranial bleeding is the most common fatal bleeding complication related to anticoagulation therapy. If a bleeding complication is occurring, make sure to have investigated why the patient is taking anticoagulant therapy. Patients who have had a recent VTE or a prosthetic heart valve have a greater need for anticoagulation than a patient with isolated AF. This information is extremely use\u00ad ful when there is a severe bleeding complication that requires reversal of anticoagulation. Consider coadministration of additional medications to patients already taking warfarin that will either increase or decrease the anticoagulant effects. Medications that increase the international normalized ratio (INR) include several antibiotics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, prednisone, cimetidine, amiodarone, by carbamazepine, barbiturates, haloperidol, and ranitidine. Addition ally, several herbal medications may also increase or decrease the INR. Lastly, assess for risk factors that increase the patient's chance of bleeding. For patients on warfarin, risk factors include INR >4.0, age >75 years, prior history of GI bleed, hypertension, cerebrovascular disease, renal insufficienc y, alcoholism, and known malignancy. Risk factors for bleeding in patients on heparin or LMWHs include increasing dose, degree of elevation of partial thromboplastin time (PTT), recent surgery or trauma, renal failure, use of another antico\u00ad agulant (aspirin, glycoprotein inhibitor), and age >70 years. ..... Physical Examination Abnormal vital sign that suggest hypovolemia and shock should be addressed immedia tely in a patient with a bleed\u00ad ing complication. Look for any evidence of head trauma. Sublingual or neck hematomas are airway emergencies, especially if they are expanding. During the cardiovascular exam, listen for murmurs or an irregular heart rhythm that suggests AF. Tenderness during the abdominal exam may suggest intraperitoneal hemorrhage. A rectal examination is indicated to diagnose GI bleeding. Conduct a thorough skin assessment because patients recently started on warfa\u00ad rin may develop warfarin skin necrosis due to capillary thrombosis in the subcutaneous tissues. Patients with HIT may also develop similar skin lesions. Ecchymosis and hematomas should be noted. DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES ...,_. Laboratory General laboratory studies include a complete blood count (to detect anemia and thrombo cytopenia) and a prothrombin time, INR, and PTT. In addition, get a basic metabolic panel to assess renal function. ..... Imaging Lower the threshold to obtain an imaging study in patients on anticoagulant medications. Any patient taking oral anticoagulation therapy who suffers minor or major head trauma with or without a headache should have a head computed tomography ( CT) scan to rule out intracranial hemorrhage. MEDICAL DECISION MAKING History, physical examination, and laboratory studies may be sufficient to arrive at a diagnosis of an anticoagulation complicat ion. However, when indicated, intracranial, splenic, liver or retroperitoneal bleeding should be ruled out with CT. If skin lesions are noted, consider the diagno\u00ad sis of warfarin skin necrosis or HIT. TREATMENT For patients starting on heparin therapy due to VTE disor\u00ad ders, the therapy begins with an 80 IU /kg bolus followed by continuous infusion of 18 IU/kg/hr. For patients receiving treatment for acute coronary syndrome or on fibrinolytic therapy or a glycoprotein inhibitor, the dose is reduced 60 IU/kg bolus, 12 IU/kg/hr infusion. PTT is measured 6 hours after initiation of the bolus, with a goal of 1.5-2.5 times normal. When clinically significant bleeding is present, stop the heparin infusion. Anticoagulation lasts up to 3 hours after the infusion is stopped. If major bleeding occurs, administer protamine (1 mg/100 IU heparin) intrave\u00ad nously (IV), given slowly over 5-10 minutes to a maximum dose of 50 mg. Enoxaparin is the most common ly prescribed LMWH in the ED. The most common dosing regimen is 1 mg/kg subcutaneo usly every 12 hours. Dosing will need to be adjusted in morbidly obese patients or those in renal failure. Protamine (1 mg/1 mg enoxaparin) can be administered to a maximum dose of 50 mg when reversal is indicated, but reversal is not as effective as with unfrac\u00ad tionated hepar in. If major or life-threatening bleeds occur, consider giving blood products such as PRBC and FFP. If warfarin therapy is being initiated in the ED, the usual starting dose is 5 mg by mouth daily. Lower doses are usually required in the elderly, in patients with liver dis\u00ad ease, or those with poor nutrition. The therapeutic range for the INR depends on the indication. Patients with mechanical valves are considered therapeutic at INR levels of 2.5-3.5, whereas other patients ( eg, with AF or VTE) are therapeutic at INR complicat ions or erapeutic INR with warfarin is Figure 73-1. CHAPTER 73 No bleeding Warfarin anticoagulation Reduce or omit next dose of warfarin Recheck INR in 24 hr Hold warfarin Recheck INR in 24 hr Hold warfarin Vitamin K 3-5 mg PO Recheck INR in 24 hr Hold warfarin Vitamin K 10 mg IV Hold warfarin Vitamin K 10 mg IV FFP 3-4 units FFP 3-4 units Figure 73-1. IV, intravenous; PO, by mouth. For reversal, N administration of vitamin K is most rapid, with onset within 1-2 hours, compared with 6-10 hours for oral dosing. Administer N vitamin Kover 30 minutes to minimize the small risk of anaphylaxis. Higher doses of vitamin K (10 mg) may result in warfarin resistance (up to 1 week) when it is time to restart anticoagulation therapy. FFP is used as the flrst-line agent for reversal of bleeding due to warfarin. The initial dose is 2-4 units. Consider giving other products such as prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) and recombinant factor VIla. The oral direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran is not routinely started in the ED. However, more patients are presenting to the ED on dabigatran with bleeding complicati ons. Currently there is no antidote for the reversal of bleeding complications associated with its use. Therefore, clinical management consists of stopping the medication, and if a major or life-threatening bleed occurs, consider giving FFP, PRBC, or some in vitro studies suggest PCC or recombinant factor Vlla. DISPOSITION Admission A patient requiring anticoagulation therapy with heparin is usually admitted to the hospital for coadministration with warfarin. This is to prevent the hypercoagulable state that occurs in the early phase of warfarin treatment. Patients with a supratherapeutic INR and bleeding require admission. Patients with a supratherapeutic INR who have a poor social situation or are at risk of falling should also be admitted. Discharge A patient with no other admission indications who requires anticoagulation may be discharged with warfarin and a 7 -day course of LMWH injections. Close follow-up should be arranged within 24-48 hours, and the patient must be knowledgeable about self-injecting. Patients with supratherapeutic INR without bleeding are frequently safe to discharge if they are not at increased risk of falling.

Franzen, MD Nathan J. Lewis, MD Key Points Familiarity with the controls is critical to performing a slit lamp examination. When positioning the patient for the exam, make sure that their forehead is touching the forehead brace and encourage them to keep it there. INDICATIONS The slit lamp is used to evaluate the anterior eye including the lids, lashes, conjunctiva, cornea, visible sclera, anterior chamber, iris, and lens for signs of trauma, hemorrhage, inflammation, or foreign bodies. CONTRAINDICATIONS The patient must be cooperative and capable of sitting upright for the duration of the examination. EQUIPMENT In addition to a slit lamp, the examiner will need 2 chairs or stools, preferably of about equal height. Fluorescein allows visualization of corneal injury. Other supplies may include anesthetic drops and a needle or ophthalmic burr (for foreign body removal), cotton-tipped applicators (for lid eversion ), and saline (to flush the eyes or lids). Ideally, one should be familiar with use of the slit lamp before examining a patient. The slit lamp is a microscope in which focus is achieved by moving the lenses instead of the object being examined. The power of the microscope typically ranges from 10-25x (or higher) and is adjusted by a dial on the housing just in front of the eyepieces. The plane of focus is changed by using the joystick to move the When using a slit lamp to remove a corneal foreign body, first guide the removal device (eg, 25-gauge needle) to the eye under direct vision, then switch to the magnified view. To prevent puncturing the cornea, keep the removal device tangential to the globe at all times. microscope toward or away from the patient. The joystick also moves the microscope left or right. Twisting the joystick raises or lowers the microscope. If the microscope does not move when the joystick is moved, you may need to loosen the locking screw on the microscope base. The light source is mounted on a swing arm that allows it to move independently from the microscope. Knowing how to adjust the multiple controls of the light source is critical to performing an exam. The power switch activates the lamp. Many slit lamps also have a rheostat (dimmer), usually near the power switch or on the base of the microscope. A selector switch near the base of the bulb housing allows the examiner to change from white to cobalt blue light (other options, including green, are usually avail\u00ad able). Just below this is a dial to adjust the height of the light beam. Near the base of the microscope arm is another dial to adjust the width of the slit. The location of these controls may vary from lamp to lamp. Figure 74-1 demonstrates their position on one model. PROCEDURE The patient should be seated and the height of the slit lamp adjusted so the patient can place his or her chin comfortably on the chinrest and forehead against the forehead brace. The height of the chinrest should be adjusted so that the patient's lateral canthus is aligned with the eye level mark 312 SLIT LAMP EXAMINATION Forehead brace Chinrest height -1--....., adjustment Figure 74-1. Key components of the slit lamp. on the chinrest support. The examiner should sit opposite the patient in a chair or stool of about the same height. Ask the patient to close his or her eyes. Turn on the lamp with a white filter and adjust the brightness as needed. Move the microscope to grossly focus the beam on the patient's closed lid. Adjust the slit width to make the beam as narrow as possible without losing brightness. Swing the light source approximately 45 degrees to your right while leaving the microscope directly facing the patient. Ask the patient to open his or her eyes. When you look through the eyepieces, the image should be very close to focused. Two reflections will be visible: one that is curved and faint and, to the left of that, one that is straight and much brighter. The curved beam is reflecting off of the cornea. Adjust the microscope so this beam is crisply focused (usually by moving slightly toward the patient, about 1 mm). Protein deposits are often visible on the corneal surface when properly focused (Figure 74-2). Scan the left half of the patient's cornea by using the joystick. Move in an arc so the plane of focus fol\u00ad lows the curve of the patient's cornea--closer to the patient as you approach the limbus and further from the patient as you move toward the pupil. Look for any corneal defects or foreign bodies. Check for ciliary flush (dilated pericorneal blood vessels, a sign of iridocyclitis) at the edges of the cor\u00ad nea. It may be necessary to have the patient look up, down, left, and/or right to fully view all parts of the cornea. After scanning the left half of the cornea, bring the microscope back to midline, swing the light source 45 degrees to your left, and examine the right half of the patient's cornea. The lids and conjunctiva can also be examined using this method, usually with a wider beam. After examining the patient with white light, fluorescein should be instilled. Switch to the cobalt blue filter, widen the light beam slightly, and repeat the exam. Look for areas Bulb housing Filter selector Slit height Eyepieces .. .. : .A. Figure 74-2.

Running or oozing of the fluorescein (Seidel sign) is caused by aqueous humor leaking from a full-thickness penetration of the cornea. Evaluating the anterior chamber for cell and flare is the third part of the examination. The slit height should be decreased and the slit width increased to create a short, wide beam of white light. Swing the light source tempo\u00ad rally, aiming the beam of light nasally through the anterior CHAPTER 74 .&. Figure 74-3.

Push the microscope forward until the patient's iris is in sharp focus, then move back slightly until the iris is out of focus-but not so far that the cornea comes into focus. The focal plane is now between the iris and cornea, in the anterior chamber. Using the pupil as a dark backdrop, watch for any material reflecting the light. Flare is caused by protein in the anterior chamber and creates a smoky appearance in the beam of light (a common analogy is \"headlights in fog:') Cells will look like \"dust particles in a sunbeam. \" The presence of either signifies inflamma tion of the anterior chamber. Use of dilating drops can cause cells to be present and applanation tonometry can cause flare, so slit lamp examination should be performed before these other tests. If a foreign body (FB) is identified during the examina\u00ad tion, first attempt to wash it out using saline. If this is not successful, it can be removed using a burr drill or a 25-or 27 -gauge needle.

Stabilize your hand on the patient's cheek or forehead so the removal device will track any movements the patient may make. Keep the removal device tangent to the surface of the patient's cornea. Guide it to the cornea under direct vision, switching to the eyepieces once the removal device is in view. If using a burr drill, press the side of the burr against the FB. When activated, the drill will \"fling\" the FB out of the cornea. If using a needle, place it on a small syringe (eg, insulin syringe) to provide better control. Guide the needle to the FB and use a scooping or flicking motion to pull the FB out of the cornea. Always move tangential to the globe. COMPLICATIONS When using the slit lamp and syringe/needle to remove an FB, careless attempts at removal or patient movement may result in penetration through the cornea. Addition ally, in the setting of ocular trauma, avoid placing pressure on the eye when the possibility of a globe rupture exists. Excessive pressure may cause the intraocular contents to be extruded.

Red Eye Craig Huston, MD Key Points Always begin with visual acuity, the vital sign of the eye. The patient should be instructed to remove contact lens and not to put them back in until the symptoms have resolved. The presence of pain and the relief of pain with instilla\u00ad tion of anesthetic agents are helpful in determining the cause of red eye. INTRODUCTION Eye complaints account for 3% of all emergency depart\u00ad ment (ED) visits. Red eye is a common complaint, and although most cases are benign, self-limited conditio ns, some may be vision-threatening. Conjunctivitis is the most common cause of a red eye, but other frequent problems include subconjun ctival hemorrhage, corneal injuries (abrasions, keratitis, and foreign bodies), and acute uveitis. Conjunctivitis may be viral, bacterial, or allergic. Viruses are the most frequent cause, especially adenovirus. The most common bacterial pathogens are conjunctivitis. Allergic conjunctivitis is due to recurrent seasonal inflammation from allergen exposure. About 15% of the population will experience allergic conjunctivitis at one time in their life. Subconjunctival hemorrhage is blood between the conjunctiva and sclera that results from a ruptured con\u00ad junctival blood vessel. Subconjun ctival hemorrhage is caused by direct trauma or indirect injury. Although it may be alarming to the patient, it is usually a benign process that occurs with a sudden increase in pressure from sneez\u00ad ing, coughing, straining, or vomiting. If atraumatic, the etiology is usually hypertension or spontaneous rupture. Follow a systematic approach to the physical examination: visual acuity, lids and lashes, conjunctiva, sclera, cornea, pupil examination, and anterior chamber. Never prescribe topical steroids without consulting with an ophthalmologist. Corneal injury is common because the epithelium is thin and easily damaged. Corneal abrasions are particularly common, representing 10% of all ED visits for eye com\u00ad plaints. The cornea is resistant to infection, but when injured, a potential portal to bacteria is created. Viral infec\u00ad tions that cause injury to the cornea and varicella (ie, herpes zoster ophthalmicus ). Contact lens use may predispose the patient to keratitis or a corneal ulcer due to gram-neg ative bacteria. Acute anterior uveitis is defined as inflammation of the iris and ciliary body. The most common cause is trauma, with patients usually presenting 1-4 days after the precipitating event. Systemic causes include ankylosing spondylitis, Reiter syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, and chronic granulomatous conditions like tuberculosis or sarcoidosis. Infectious ulcerations can also cause anterior uveitis. CLINICAL PRESENTATION History The single most important historical feature that helps determine the cause of red eye is the presence of eye pain. Conjunctivitis is characterized by a gritty foreign body sensation and tearing or discharge, but it is usually not 315 CHAPTER 75 particularly painful. Viral (ie, adenovirus) and allergic sources tend to be pruritic with watery discharge, but sus\u00ad pect bacterial infection with mucopurulent discharge. An infectious source often begins unilaterally and spreads through autoinoculation. Constitutional symptoms such as fever, rhinorrhea, and myalgias suggest a systemic viral illness. Allergic conjunctivitis is associated with more intense itching and seasonal history. Similarly, subconjunctival hemorrhage is a painless condition. Patients usually present to the ED merely because the appearance of blood on the sclera of the eye is concerning to the patient. Eye pain is produced when the epithelium of the cornea is injured or there is inflammation to deeper structures (ie, iris). Corneal abrasions due to trauma or foreign body are characterized by pain, foreign body sensation, tearing, and photophobia. A history of working with power tools and metal should raise the suspicion of a foreign body. If the abrasion is large enough, patients may complain of decreased vision. Contact lens use or exposure to ultravio\u00ad let light should be ascertained and raises the suspicion for corneal inflammation/i nfection (ie, keratitis). Acute anterior uveitis presents with a gradual onset of a painful red eye with severe photophobia and diminished vision. The patient will prefer to sit in a dark room with a hand over the eye. Physical Examination The exam should always follow the same pattern: visual acu\u00ad ity, lids and lashes, conjunctiva, sclera, cornea, pupil, ante\u00ad rior chamber, findings in subconjun ctival hemorrhage, corneal abrasion, and acute anterior uveitis are listed in Table 75-1. Additional characteristic features are listed here. Patients with conjunctivitis will have diffuse injection of the conjunctiva. With all causes of conjunctivitis, fluid can accumulate behind the conjunctiva known as chemosis (Figure 75-1). Allergic eyelids may hemorrhage has a characteristic appearance with bright red blood on the sclera under the thin conjunctival layer (Figure 75-2). Corneal injury is signaled by uptake of fluorescein seen with the cobalt blue light. Corneal abrasions will affect .A. Figure 75-2. Subconjunctival hemorrhage. Table 75-1. Physical examination findings in patients with red eye. Examination Conjunctivitis Subconjunctival Hemorrhage Corneal Abrasion Acute Anterior Uveitis Visual acuity Normal Normal Decreased when central Decreased due to pain, tearing Lids Edema, erythema Normal Normal Normal Conjunctiva Injection Normal Injection Normal Sclera Normal Erythema Normal Ciliary flush Cornea None, unless associated None Yes None (fluorescein corneal ulcer uptake) Pupil Normal Normal Normal Constricted Anterior chamber None None None Yes (cell and flare) visual acuity if large or there is central involvement. Lids should always be everted to look for a foreign body. If multiple lines of fluorescein uptake course together, this is highly suggestive of a foreign body under the lid that scratches the cornea with blinking. In herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, a branching dendritic ulcer is characteristic, whereas involvement of the cornea in herpes zoster ophthalmicus causes a thin wavy lesion similar In patients with herpes zoster ophthal\u00ad micus, a zoster-form rash is present on the forehead in the Vl distribution of the trigeminal nerve. A bacterial cause of a corneal ulceration will also demonstrate significant uptake of fluorescein in the ulcer. Acute anterior uveitis may affect visual acuity due to pain and tearing. The sclera may have a ciliary flush identified by redness at the limbus. No fluorescein uptake is seen, and pain is not improved with topical anesthetic application. The pupil is often constricted, and there is consensual photophobia (pain produced by shining light in the unaffected eye). On slit lamp exam, the anterior chamber will show \"cell and flare:' When cellular debris is significant, it can layer at the bottom of the anterior chamber between the cornea and iris. This collection is known as a hypopyon (Figure 75-3). Cell and flare and a hypopyon are also common with infectious causes of corneal ulceration. Figure 75-3. Hypopyon. RED EYE MEDICAL DECISION MAKING The presence of pain, response to topical anesthetic appli\u00ad cation, and the findings on the fluorescein examination are some of the most important features to determining the cause of a red eye (Figure 75-4). TREATMENT Uncomplica ted conjunctlVItls is treated with topical antibiotic drops or ointment if a bacterial source is sus\u00ad pected. Options tion of treatment is 5-7 days. Remind patients of the importance of handwashing for at least 2 weeks to limit spread. Those who suffer from allergic conjunctivitis ben\u00ad efit from systemic antihistamines and histamine-blocking eye drops. For symptomatic relief, patients can use cool compresses and artificial tears. If Chlamydia trachomatis or Neisseria gonorrhea are suspected, patients will require systemic and topical antibiotics and must also have emer\u00ad gent ophthalmologic consult. Patients with a subconjunctival hemorrhage need only reassurance that the blood will resolve within a couple weeks, similar to a bruise. If the patient has suf\u00ad fered recurrent then and work-up for bleeding disorders . Treatment of corneal injury depends on the cause. A patient with a corneal abrasion should be prescribed pain relief and infection prophylaxis. Patients benefit from a cycloplegic (cyclopentolate or homatropine) to relieve ciliary spasm and reduce pain. They will often need narcotic analgesia. To prevent secondary infec\u00ad tions, prescribe a topical antibiotic such as l Oo/o sulfa\u00ad cetamide. Patients with herpes zoster ophthalmicus should receive oral acyclovir if treatment can be instituted within 72 hours of onset. Prompt treatment reduces the likelihood of eye involvement from 50o/o to 25%. Intravenous (N) indicated. HSV is treated with topical anti\u00ad viral drops, such as Viroptic, and consultation with an ophthalmologist. Corneal ulcers require emergent oph\u00ad thalmologic consultation. Contact lens wearers should dispose of current lens and be given coverage for pseudo\u00ad monas with a topical arninoglycoside or quinolone. The patient should not resume use of new lens until symptoms have resolved. Do not use an eye patch, as it is associated with an increased rate of corneal ulceration and pseudo\u00ad monal infection. Tetanus prophylaxis should be updated. Acute anterior uveitis treatment should be instituted only in consultation with an ophthalmologist, as continual monitoring and treatment is required. To eliminate ciliary spasm, use a long-acting cycloplegic inflamma tion, the tetracaine and uptake of fluorescein Corneal abrasion CHAPTER 75 A. Figure 75-4. Red eye diagnostic algorithm. ophthalmologist may also recommend a topical steroid such as prednisolone. DISPOSITION Admission Patients with bacterial conjunctivitis secondary to N. gonorrhea should be admitted for IV antibiotic therapy. Consider admission of patients with corneal ulcers if the patient is unable to self-administer antibiotics, there is a high likelihood of noncompliance, or a large ulcer is present. Discharge Patients with corneal abrasion, herpetic keratitis, and acute anterior uveitis should be re-evaluated by an ophthalmolo\u00ad gist within 24-48 hours. Patients with simple conjunctivitis signs or symptoms Red with chemosis, discharge, crusting be discharged to fol\u00ad low-up with their primary care physicians. SUGGESTED READING Cronau H, et al.

Moskoff, MD Key Points History and physical examination alone will lead to the diagnosis in most patients presenting with acute visual loss. The most important first step in addressing the patient with acute monocular visual loss is to determine whether the loss of vision is associated with pain. In patients with acute visual loss without pain, suspect central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO), central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO), or retinal detachment. INTRODUCTION Central retinal artery occlusion ( CRAO) and central retinal vein occlusion ( CRVO) occur most frequently in elderly patients. About 90% of cases of CRVO occur in patients older than 50 years. CRAO is a result of a thrombotic plaque or more commonly an embolus of the central retinal artery, whereas CRVO is caused by thrombosis of the retinal vein. Optic neuritis is a painful rapid reduction of central vision secondary to an inflammatory process of the optic nerve. Optic neuritis occurs more commonly in women aged 15 to 45 years. Retinal detachment results from traction of the vitreous humor on the retina. This causes a tear in the retina and a separation of the inner neuronal retina from the outer pigment epithelial layer. Retinal detachment may occur after ocular trauma, but in atraumatic cases, this condition is more prevalent in men >45 years old and in patients with significant myopia. The prevalence in the United States is 0.3%. Temporal (giant cell) arteritis is a vasculitis that results in monocu lar loss of vision associated with a unilateral temporal headache. Temporal arteritis occurs most commonly in woman >50 years old. Whites are more frequently affected than are other races. Temporal arteritis 319 Patients with acute visual loss with associated pain may have optic neuritis, temporal (giant cel l) arteritis, acute angle-closure glaucoma, or a large central corneal abra\u00ad sion or ulceration. An ophthalmologist should be consulted immediately when CRAO or acute angle-closure glaucoma are diag\u00ad nosed in the emergency department. is a vasculitis of medium and large arteries and can lead to optic nerve infarction and blindness. Acute angle-clo sure glaucoma is a sudden painful monocular loss of vision secondary to increased pressure in the anterior chamber. Acute angle-closure glaucoma represents <10% of all cases of glaucoma in the United States. It is more common in women and is also more common in African American and Asian populations. Acute angle-closure glaucoma occurs in patients with shallow (narrow) anterior chamber angles. As the pupil dilates, the iris leaflet touches the lens. This impedes the flow of aqueous humor from the posterior to the anterior chamber with a subsequent increase in hydrostatic pressure. CLINICAL PRESENTATION ..... History Painless, acute loss of vision is characteristic of CRAO, CRVO, and retinal detachment. In patients with CRAO, the monocular vision loss is usually complete and quite sudden. Risk factors include hypertension, carotid artery disease, diabetes mellitus, cardiac disease (especially atrial fibrillation and valvular disease), vasculitis, temporal CHAPTER 76 artentls, and sickle cell disease. Central retinal artery occlusion must be considered and treated early because irreversible visual loss occurs after 90 minutes. The presentation of CRVO is more insidious than retinal artery occlusion. The patient will have a sudden painless monocular decrease in vision that is most commonly noted on awakening. Patients may also describe a sudden decrease, acutely imposed on a chronic gradual worsening over a longer period of time ( eg, 1 week). Risk relates to likelihood of thrombosis. The physician should have increased suspi\u00ad cion in patients with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, arte\u00ad riosclerosis, chronic glaucoma, and vasculitis. Patients with retinal detachment present with painless loss of vision often described as a sensation of a curtain moving across the visual field or a shade being pulled down over the eye. Flashing lights, \"spider webs,\" or \"coal dust\" in the visual field may precede visual loss. Risk is related most closely to severe myopia. Other risk factors include trauma, previous cataract surgery, family history, Marfan syndrome (or other inherited connective tissue disorders ), and diabetes mellitus. Painful loss of vision is seen in patients with optic neuritis, temporal arteritis, and acute angle closure glaucoma. Patients with optic neuritis will present with rap\u00ad idly progressive reduction or blurring of their vision. Ocular pain worsens with eye movement In patients without a previous diagnosis, 25-65% will develop multiple sclerosis. Temporal arteritis presents as a sudden monocular loss of vision associated with a unilateral temporal headache. Eye pain usually is not present. Risk factors include polymyalgia rheumatica, female, Northern European descent, and >50 years old. Lastly, acute angle-closure glaucoma presents as cloudy vision associated with halos around lights. In addition, the patient will complain of eye pain or headache along with nausea and vomiting and possibly abdominal pain. Often patients will have no previous history of glaucoma. Farsighted (hyperopic) persons are at risk secondary to the shape of their anterior chamber; female and elderly patients are also at increased risk. ..... Physical Examination For a full description of the physical examination of the eye, see Chapter 75. In acute visual loss, fluorescein stain\u00ad ing is essential to exclude corneal abrasions or ulcerations; however, the funduscopic examination is usually most diagnostic. To perform the funduscopic exam, allow the patient to sit in a dark room for several minutes before starting. When the pupil is sufficiently dilated, ask the patient to focus on an object on the wall and ignore the examiner. Focus the ophthalmoscope on the eye and gradually approach the cornea from a lateral position. The optic disc is noted medially. If only vessels are seen, the optic disc can be located by knowing that the blood vessel's branches \"point\" to the direction of the disc. A 8 Figure 76-1. A. Central retinal artery occlusion. B. Central retinal vein occlusion. CRAO Visual acuity is markedly decreased, with the patient often only able to perceive shadows or count fingers. Initial pupil examination may be normal; however, after 1-2 hours, the pupil may dilate. The pupil is poorly reactive to direct light but has a greater consensual response to light (afferent pupillary defect). On funduscop ic examination, a pale retina with a cherry-red spotin the macular area (fovea) is the classic finding (Figure 76-1A). CRVO Visual acuity is variable but the deficit is usually less severe than retinal artery occlusion. The patient may retain the ability to see shadows or count fingers. The pupil will react sluggishly to light. On funduscopic exam\u00ad ination, there may be retinal hemorrha ge, tortuous retinal veins, and disc edema, referred to as \"blood and thunder\" (Figure 76-1B). ACUTE VISUAL LOSS .6. Figure 76-2. Retinal detachment on bedside ultrasound. Retinal detachment The extent of the loss of vision is dependent on the degree of detachment. Visual field defects will be noted on con\u00ad frontation. The pupil examination is unremarkable. Funduscopic examination reveals an undulating, dull grey, detached retina. Ocular ultrasound is a bedside procedure that is very helpful to making the diagnosis of retinal detachment (Figure 76-2). Optic neuritis Visual acuity varies from mildly reduced to no light perception. Often the visual deficit will be limited to the central visual field, and the patient will complain more of a defect with color vision rather than sight. This can be evalu\u00ad ated using the red desaturation test.Have the patient look at a dark red object with one eye and then test the other eye to see if the object looks the same color. The affected eye will often see the object as lighter or pink. An afferent pupillary defect will often be present. If the fundus is normal, the patient has retrobulbar optic neuritis. However, if the fun\u00ad dus is swollen or hyperemic, the patient has papillitis. Temporal arteritis Palpation may reveal tender, tortuous, and sometimes pulseless temporal arteries. The degree of loss of vision depends on when the diagnosis is made. If diagnosed late, visual acuity will be markedly decreased. An afferent pupil\u00ad lary defect may be present. On funduscopic examination, a pale, swollen optic disc will be present. A 8 .6. Figure 76-3. A. Schititz tonometer B. Tono-Pen. Acute is markedly decreased. The patient's sclera will be red due to ciliary injection. The cornea will be cloudy. On gentle palpation, the eye may have a rock hard consisten cy. The pupil is mid-dilated and nonreactive to light. Funduscopic examination is difficult to perform in the face of a cloudy cornea, but is otherwise unremarkable. To diagnose acute angle-clo sure glaucoma, intraocular pressure is measured with a Schiotz tonometer or Tono\u00ad Pen (Figure 76-3). mmHg. A pres\u00ad sure >40 mmHg is diagnostic. DIAGNOSTIC When tempora l arteritis is suspected, an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) should be obtained. An ESR Retinal detachment CHAPTER 76 Increased lOP Glaucoma Normal lOP Optic neuritis Headache with painless eye and elevated ESR Temporal arteritis .A Figure 76-4. Acute visual loss sedimentation rate; lOP, intraocular pressure. >50 mm/hr is almost universally present in patients with temporal arteritis. Normal ESR for males is age/2; females (age+ 10)/2. MEDICAL DECISION MAKING The first step is to determine the presence of pain associated with the acute visual loss (Figure 76-4). In the absence of pain, a history of complete sudden loss of vision versus a gradual decrease in vision in conjunction with the funduscopic examination should differentiate CRAO from CRVO. Preceding symptoms of a shade drop\u00ad ping or scotoma often aid in the diagnosis of retinal detachment. If retinal detachment is suspected, perform a bedside ultrasound of the eye. If pain is associated with visual loss, then an elevated intra-ocular pressure suggests acute angle closure glaucoma. Temporal arteritis is likely when an elderly patient is complaining of headache and the ESR is elevated. Optic neuritis is best diagnosed by the fundu\u00ad scopic examination. TREATMENT Treatment of CRAO must begin as soon as the diagnosis is suspected because permanent visual loss typically occurs after 90 minutes. The goal of treatment is to restore retinal artery blood flow by dislodging the clot. This is accomplished by dilating the artery and reducing intraocular pressure through the following modalities: intermittent digital massage of the globe (5 seconds on, 5 seconds off) for 5-15 minutes; hyperventilation into a paper bag 10 minutes of every hour; acetawlamide 500 mg intravenously (IV) and a beta-bloc ker (timolol 0.5% drops intraocular ). Immediate ophthalmology consultation is paramount for paracentesis (aspiration of aqueous fluid) of the anterior chamber. ACUTE VISUAL LOSS CRVO is not as emergent as CRAO because no immedi\u00ad ate treatment is effective. Patients should be referred to ophthalmology for confirmation of the diagnosis and monitoring of disease progression. Patients diagnosed with retinal detachment require immediate ophthalmology consultation to evaluate for retinal reattachment surgery. The patient should be instructed to avoid activity and remain on bed rest until seen by an ophthalmologist. Optic neuritis is treated with a short course of high\u00ad dose N methylpredn isolone followed by a rapid oral taper of prednisone. This provides a rapid recovery of symptoms in the acute phase. This treatment may also delay the short\u00ad term development of MS. Temporal arteritis treatment begins with oral prednisone (80 mg/day) initiated in the ED when the diagnosis is suspected. Follow-up with an ophthalmologist for evaluation and a temporal artery biopsy should be arranged. Treatment of acute angle-closure glaucoma consists of the sequential administration of several agents to decrease intraocular pressure: beta-bloc ker (Timoptic 0.5%) 1 acetazolamide 500 mg by is administered to constrict the pupil and pull the iris back, helping to prevent a recurrence. The unaffected eye should be treated prophylactic ally. Consult ophthalmology immediately because the definitive treatment is bilateral laser iridectomy. DISPOSITION Admission Optic neuritis is frequently managed as an inpatient for treatment and an expedited work-up, including magnetic resonance imaging. CRAO, retinal detachment, and acute angle-closure glaucoma require immediate ophthalmology consultation. Admission is required when defmitive treatment cannot be accomplished in the ED. Discharge Temporal arteritis can be managed on an outpatient basis after the initiation of steroids if the patient has appropriate follow-up. CRVO is managed on an outpatient basis with ophthalmology referral. SUGGESTED READING Graves JS, Galetta SL. Acute visual loss and other neuro\u00ad opthalmologic emergencies: Management.

Senecal, MD Points Anterior epistaxis is more common than posterior epistaxis. Anterior epistaxis generally stops with pressure, but may require nasal packing. INTRODUCTION Epistaxis is common, occurring in 1 of every 7 persons in the United States. The incidence is highest in persons aged 2-10 and 50-80 years. Epistaxis, like all hemorrhage, needs prompt evaluation and treatment. The primary goal of diag\u00ad nosis is to determine the location of bleeding: anterior ver\u00ad sus posterior. Once the site of bleeding is identified, bleeding is stopped using various techniques ranging from chemical cautery (ie, silver nitrate) to nasal packing. Anterior epistaxis accounts for 90% of nosebleeds. Most commonly, the bleed\u00ad ing is venous from Kiesselbach the typically originates turbinate and is more commonly arterial in sphenopa latine artery. Posterior epistaxis represents 10% of nosebleeds. CLINICAL PRESENTATION History Determine the onset and duration to assess severity of blood loss. Inquire about comorbidities and medications, especially blood thinners and antiplatelet drugs. Identify mechanisms already used by the patient to attempt to stop the bleeding. The most common etiologies of anterior epistaxis are trauma, dehumidification of the nasal mucosa (typically from dry air during winter months), and digital manipula \u00ad tion. Other common causes include allergies, nasal sprays, Posterior epistaxis requires emergent ear, nose, and throat consultation and admission. Any patient who requires nasal packing should be given antibiotics to prevent toxic shock syndrome or sinusitis. illicit drugs, and nasal infections. Posterior epistaxis is more common in elderly debilitated patients with comor\u00ad bid diseases such as a coagulop athy, atherosclerosis, neo\u00ad plasm, or hypertension. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION Inspect the nares to identify the site of bleeding. A nasal speculum is useful to enhance visualization of the nares. If the site of bleeding cannot be identified, have the patient pinch the anterior soft portion of the nose, and examine the patient's oropharynx. If blood is trickling down the oropharynx while the patient is holding anterior pressure, a posterior bleed may be present. DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES Laboratory Blood work is not indicated in the majority of patients with epistaxis. Obtain a complete blood count in patients at risk for thrombocytopenia or anemia. Obtain coagula\u00ad tion studies in patients taking the anticoagulant warfarin and in patients with cirrhosis. Perform blood typing for patients with severe bleeding who may require transfusion. Imaging Imaging studies are rarely indicated in the work-up and treatment of epistaxis. Angiography with interventional 324 radiology embolization can be utilized in rare cases of refractory posterior bleeding from the sphenopalatine and greater palatine arteries. MEDICAL DECISION MAKING The mainstay of epistaxis evaluation and treatment is iden\u00ad tification of the source of the bleed to facilitate prompt and effective treatment. Bleeding that ceases with pressure over the anterior soft portion of the nose is typically from an anterior source. A posterior bleed is suspected when blood continues to drain down the posterior pharynx while the anterior portion of the nose is being squeezed (Figure 77 -1). EPISTAXIS TREATMENT If bleeding is significant, insert an intravenous line and place the patient on a cardiac monitor. Intubation is rarely necessary, but indicated if bleeding is severe and is com\u00ad promising the airway. Consult ear, nose, and throat (ENT) immediately in cases with severe bleeding. If an anterior bleed is suspected, have the patient hold continuous pressure over the soft cartilaginous portion of the nose for 15 minutes. During this time, assemble equipment including nasal speculum, headlight, suction, vasoconstr ic\u00ad tor, lubricant, and anterior packing or balloon (Figure 77-2). If the bleeding has subsided after 15 minutes, gently apply Apply pressure to anterior nose for 15 min Bleeding persists after pressure released Administer topical vasoconstrictors and an<>cth<>tirc or use chemical cautery for slow oozing Bleeding resolved Bleeding resolved Bleeding resolved after pressure released Apply topical bacitracin and discharge home 1------ll>l Discharge on amoxicillin 500 mg TID ENT or PCP follow-up in 48-72 hrs Figure 77-1.

Left, from top to bottom, anterior packs include the Rhino Rocket, Merocel, and petroleum gauze. Right, nasal speculum. bacitracin to the anterior naris and discharge the patient. If bleeding is ongoing after 15 minutes of direct pressure, initi\u00ad ate topical vasoconstriction with oxymetazoline (Afrin) spray and topical by inserting pledgets soaked in 2% lidocaine or 4% cocaine. Then hold pressure for 10-15 minutes and reassess. If slow bleeding persists, con\u00ad sider chemical cautery with silver nitrate sticks. Roll the stick over the area until a gray eschar is formed. Never hold the stick in one place for longer than 5 seconds, and never use silver nitrate bilaterally due to risk for nasal septal perforation. If topical vasoconstrictors and cautery fail to stop the bleeding, pack the naris with petroleum gauze, a com\u00ad pressed sponge (Merocel or Rhino Rocket), or an anterior epistaxis ballo on. When using a compressed sponge, apply lubricant to the sponge before inserting it into the nose, and use approximately 10 mL of saline to expand the sponge once it is in the nostril. Hemostatic material (Surgicel, Gelfoam, topical thrombin) may also be useful in controlling hemorrhage. Patients with nasal packing should be treated with prophylactic antibiotics (amoxicil\u00ad lin 500 mg orally 3x a day) against staphylococci to prevent toxic shock syndrome, sinusitis, and otitis media. Patients with nasal packing should follow-up with ENT or with their primary care physician in 2-3 days. Posterior epistaxis is more challenging to treat because it is difficult to tamponade the site of bleeding, because the bleeding is often arterial, and because patients with posterior bleeds frequently have significant comorbidities. If a posterior bleed is suspected, consult ENT. In the meantime, attempt tamponade using a balloon device or a Foley catheter (Figure 77-3). To tamponade using a balloon device, after applying topical anesthesia and vasoconstriction to the naris, apply lubricant to the catheter and insert the catheter into the nose until the tip is seen in the oropharynx. Inflate the posterior balloon with 4-8 mL of sterile saline; then pull the device .&. Figure 77-3. Epistat nasal catheter for posterior epistaxis. The the anterior naris, and the 1 0-ml balloon is used to provide posterior tamponade of bleeding. anteriorly to tamponade the bleeding. Inflate the anterior balloon with 10-25 mL of sterile saline. Assess the posterior oropharynx to assure cessation of bleeding. To tamponade using the Foley catheter method, obtain a 14F Foley with 30-mL balloon. Cut the tip of the catheter just distal to the balloon. Suction, anesthetize, and vasoconstrict the naris. Insert the catheter into the nose until the tip is seen in the oropharynx. Inflate the balloon with 10-15 mL of sterile saline. Pull back on the catheter until bleeding has stopped. Place an anterior pack. Use gauze to secure the catheter and prevent pressure necrosis on the nasal tip. If not done already, consult ENT. As with anterior bleeds, place patients with nasal packing on prophylactic antibiotics. DISPOSITION Admission Admission to a monitored setting is indicated for patients with posterior epistaxis, even if hemorrhage is controlled. Severe bleeding and fatal airway obstruction secondary to dislodgment of the packing can occur. Although rare, patients may develop a nasopulmonary reflex, manifested by hypoxia, hypercarbia, dysrhyth mias, or coronary isch\u00ad emia secondary to posterior packing placement. Discharge Discharge is appropriate for patients with anterior epistaxis once bleeding is controlled. Remember to prescribe antibi\u00ad otics to patients who have nasal packing in place. Follow-up should be arranged in 2-3 days to have the packing removed. SUGGESTED READING Kucik CJ, Klenney T. Management of Emergency Medicine: Study ed.

Tooth fractures are categorized and treated according to the Ellis classification. Clean avulsed teeth with care to avoid dislodging the periodontal ligament. INTRODUCTION Dental complaints are common in the emergency depart\u00ad ment (ED). As much as 4% of ED workload is dental-related. Uninsured patients and even patients with basic medical coverage but no dental insurance are forced to seek care in the ED. The first step to diagnosing the dental emergency is to understand the anatomy. There are 32 teeth in most adults (2 incisors, 1 canine, 2 premolars, and 3 molars per side). The teeth are numbered from 1 to 16 on the top starting with the right-hand side. Bottom teeth are numbered 17 to 32 starting on the left and ending with the bottom right. Dental trauma is a common complaint encountered by emergency providers. Approximately 80% of traumatized teeth are maxillary teeth. Tooth fractures are based on the Ellis classification. Ellis I fractures involve only the enamel. Ellis II fractures include the dentin, and Ellis III fractures are present when both the dentin and pulp are exposed (Figure 78-1). Permanent teeth that are avulsed should be reim\u00ad planted immediately; avulsed primary teeth are never reimplanted. Ludwig angina is a surgical emergency that requires prompt drainage. socket relates directly to subsequent tooth viability. A sub\u00ad luxed tooth refers to a tooth that is \"loose\" due to trauma. Mandible fractures occur at 1%). They are most common after blunt trauma to the jaw from either an altercation or a Ellis class I Alveolar fracture Tooth avulsion is a result of disruption of the tooth's attachment apparatus. The periodontal ligament is the pri\u00ad mary source of attachment of the tooth to the alveolar bone and is of primary concern to the emergency physician. Tooth avulsion occurs with a prevalence of up to 15% of cases. Management depends on whether the avulsed tooth is a permanent or a deciduous tooth. Preservation of the peri\u00ad odontal ligament and limiting the length of time out of the Figure 78-1. Ellis classification of fractured teeth. 327 CHAPTER 78 motor vehicle collision (MVC). Fractures are multiple in half of cases because of the ring shape of the mandible . Mandible fractures are the second most common fracture of the facial bones behind nasal bone fractures. Dental caries are the most common dental emergen cy. A typical odontogenic infection originates from dental caries, which decay the protective enamel. Traumatic injury, peri\u00ad odontal disease, or postsurgical infections can also contrib\u00ad ute to disruption in the enamel. Once the enamel is dissolved, bacteria travel through the microporous dentin to the pulp, causing pulpitis. The bacteria then can track to the root apex, soft tissues, and finally into the deeper fascial planes. Dental abscesses form secondary to caries (periapi\u00ad cal) or trapped food between gums and teeth (periodonta l). Several types of dental abscesses exist. Superficial abscesses in the orofacial area include the buccal, submental, masticator, and canine spaces. If unrecognized or untreated, these infections spread to deeper spaces within the head and neck. Ludwig angina is a rapidly spreading cellulitis of the floor of the mouth involving the sublingual, submental, and submandibular spaces bilater\u00ad ally. Its name originates from the sensation of choking and suffocation that a patient with this infection experiences. Ludwig angina is an emergency because the massive swelling can result in airway obstruction. Ludwig angina occurs secondary to an infection of the posterior mandibular molars in 75% of cases. It can also be second\u00ad ary to trauma. If the infection continues to spread, the potential exists for adjacent retropharyngeal and mediasti\u00ad nal infection. Ludwig angina is most commonl y due to anaerob ic (Bacteroides) and aerobic (Streptococcus, Staphylococcus) oral flora in an immunocompromised patient who is often elderly, diabetic, or an alcoholic. Two other dental infections that may be encountered are alveolar osteitis and acute necrotizing gingivitis (ANUG). Alveolar osteitis (dry occurs after a dental extraction (usually mandibular third molars). Patients typically present on day 2 or 3. Pain is due to premature loss of healing clot with localized inflammat ion. ANUG (trench mouth) is the only periodontal disease in which bacteria invade nonnecrotic tissue. Etiology is usually bac\u00ad teria normally present. Human immunodeficiency virus infection, previous necrotizing gingivitis, poor oral hygiene, and stress are predisposing factors. CLINICAL PRESENTATION History Dental Trauma Patients are typically male and were often involved in an MVC, sports activity, or assault. Ellis I fractures are pain\u00ad less, and the patient may only note a jagged edge to the tooth. Ellis II fractures present with the primary complaint of hot and cold sensitivity as the exposed dentin is quite sensitive. Patients with Ellis III fractures present with severe pain, although pain may be absent if there is neuro\u00ad vascular compromise. When a tooth avulses, the time the tooth spends out of the socket is one of the most important pieces of informa\u00ad tion to obtain. If the tooth is out for <20 minutes, prognosis is good. If >60 minutes has elapsed, a successful re-implant is much more difficult. Patients with a mandible fracture report jaw pain, inability to open the mouth, and possible malocclusion of the teeth. Numbness of the lower lip suggests an injury to the inferior alveolar nerve. Odontogenic Infection Patients with dental caries present with dull, continuous pain made worse with any stimulus. They typically have poor dental hygiene with grossly carious teeth. Pain does not occur until decay impinges on the pulp and an inflammatory process develops. If a dental abscess is present, there is excruciating pain that is made worse with tapping on the tooth. These patients may have facial swelling, especially if periapical in location. When evaluating for an abscess, elicit a history of fever, trismus, drooling, inability to handle secretions, and recent dental infection or trauma. Predisposing factors include dental caries, alcoholism, elderly, or diabetes mellitus. angina presents with pain, dysphagia, odynopha\u00ad gia, dysphonia, trismus, and drooling. The patient may also complain of severe neck and sublingual pain. By some estimates, up to 33% can result in airway obstruction. Patients with acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis present with pain, metallic taste, and foul breath. They may also complain of fever and malai se. Physical Examination Dental Trauma Inspect the teeth for Ellis fractures. The dentin is visualized on examination as a creamy yellow color present in the center of the broken tooth. The pulp is seen as a pink tinge or drop of blood within the exposed dentin. If tooth avul\u00ad sion has occurred, evaluate the socket and surrounding soft tissue for lacerations, ecchymosis, or foreign bodies. When examining an avulsed tooth, do not touch the root. Malocclusion, deformity, or bleeding in the mouth sug\u00ad gests a mandible fracture. An intra-oral laceration may represent an open fracture. Pain, mental nerve paresthesia, and segment mobility may also be present. Ecchymosis under the tongue is highly suggestive of a mandible frac \u00ad ture. The tongue blade test is used to clinically exclude a mandible fracture. The patient is asked to bite on a tongue blade. If the examiner is able to break the blade by turning it while the patient bites down, then a mandible fracture is unlikely. The sensitivity of this test is 95%. Odontogenic Infection Dental caries are noted on inspection. If percussion tenderness or changes in temperature cause pain, consider pulpitis. DENTAL EMERGENCIES Dental abscesses are diagnosed based on the physical examination. A submental space infection is characterized by a firm midline swelling beneath the chin. This abscess is due to infection from the mandibular incisors. A sublingual space infection is indicated by swelling and pain of the floor of the mouth and dysphagia. It is due to an anterior mandibular tooth infection. Submandibular space infection is identified by swelling around the angle of the jaw. Mild trismus is frequently pres\u00ad ent. These abscesses are caused by an infection of the man - dibular molar. Buccal space infections present with cheek swelling (Figure 78-2A). Canine space infection is charac\u00ad terized by anterior facial swelling and loss of the nasolabial fold. This infection can extend into the infraorbital region and be confused with ocular pathology (Figure 78-2B). Masticator space infections present with trismus. Trismus is the inability to fully open the jaw due to tonic spasm of the muscles of mastication (lockjaw). In the absence of trauma, a patient with facial swelling and trismus has a masticator space infection until proven otherwise. Ludwig angina presents with massive swelling in the floor of the mouth that is painful to palpation. The swelling may produce an elevation of the tongue, which can occlude the oropharynx (Figure 78-3). The patient's anterior neck may be brawny in character secondary to edema. A Alveolar osteitis is identified by a fresh extraction site with absence of clot. ANUG presents with a gray pseudomembrane, ulcerations, gingival bleeding, and fetid breath. Patients often have associated regional lymphadenop athy. DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES No laboratory test is essential for the diagnoses of dental trauma or odontogenic infections. Panorex radiograph is use\u00ad ful to diagnose a mandible fracture and allows for the visual\u00ad ization of the entire mandible with 1 radiograph (Figure 78-4). A soft-tissue lateral neck radiograph can be used to visualize the retropharyngeal space and exclude other diagnoses. Computed tomography is used to diagnose mandible frac\u00ad tures and to localize odontogenic infections. In patients with potential airway compromise, evaluation and treatment should not be delayed while waiting for imaging studies. MEDICAL DECISION MAKING See Figure 78-5 for a diagnostic algorithm for patients with suspected odontogenic infections. TREATMENT ...... Dental Trauma Ellis I fractures require no immediate treatment; patients should be referred to a dentist. For Ellis II fractures, place a calcium hydroxide paste, cement, or moist gauze over the dentin, then cover the tooth with aluminum foil to decrease contamination of the pulp. Patients will require urgent follow-up with a dentist within 24 hours. Ellis III B Figure 78-2. A. Buccal space infection. B. Canine space infection. fractures should be covered with calcium hydroxide, cement, or moist gauze and then covered with foil. These patients require immediate dental referral to avoid pulpal necrosis and loss of the tooth. Definitive treatment includes pulpotomy or pulpecto my. CHAPTER 78 B Figure 78-3. A patient with Ludwig angina. A. Tongue. B. Neck. Never reimplant avulsed primary teeth, as they can ankylose and block the eruption of permanent teeth. If the avulsed tooth is permanent, care should be taken to hold the tooth by the crown, carefully avoiding the periodontal ligament. If the ligament is damaged, the success of re-implantation may be compromised. In the ED, the tooth should be rinsed gently with saline; do not \"brush\" the .A Figure 78-4. Panorex demonstrating fractures to the right body and left angle of the mandible. tooth clean, as this will disrupt the periodontal ligament. The socket is rinsed with normal saline to remove blood clot. Then re-implant the tooth in its socket with a firm pressure into the socket. Have the patient bite on gauze to maintain the tooth in the socket. If unable to replace the tooth, place it in Hank solution, which preserves the liga\u00ad ment for 4-6 hours. Milk is an acceptable alternative if Hank solution is not available. Patients require prophylac\u00ad tic antibiotics, soft diet, tetanus immunizatio n, and an immediate dental referral for tooth stabilization. A tooth loosened in its socket or moved may require repositioning if the bite is impacted. Other general instructions for loose teeth include soft diet, pain control, and dental referral. Patients with a mandibular fracture will require narcotic pain control. Antibiotics (penicillin G 2-4 million U intravenously [IV] or clindamycin 900 mg IV) are administered for open fractures. Be sure to update tetanus status. Oral surgery consultation for operative repair is indicated, with the exception of isolated nondisplaced condylar fractures, which can be managed nonoperatively. Odontogenic Infection A nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug with or without narcotics is indicated for patients with dental caries. Consider dental blocks with local anesthetics as an adjunct for pain control. Most patients do not require antibiotics unless there is an obvious associated infection. Consider outpatient dental referral. Patients with dental abscesses are treated with analgesics, antibiotics, and drainage. Most emergency physicians can drain a perigingi val abscess, whereas most periapical abscesses need to be referred to an oral surgeon. Patients with localized infection should be treated with antistrepto \u00ad coccal oral antibiotics, such as oral penicillin (500 mg three times daily in adults or 50 mglkg/day divided into three doses in children). In cases of penicillin allergy, erythromy\u00ad cin or clindamycin (Cleocin) may be substituted. Definitive therapy is root canal or extraction. Ideally, patients should be evaluated by a dentist within 1-2 days but warned to return earlier if swelling or pain worsens. The treatment of Ludwig angina involves maintenance of the airway, IV antibiotics, and surgical drainage in the operating room (OR). The primary concern to the emer\u00ad gency physician is maintenance of the patient's airway. Maintain the patient in a seated position and place airway equipment at the bedside. The patient should be given IV penicillin plus metronidazole, cefoxitin, or clindamycin. Ear, nose, and throat should be consulted immedia tely and arrangements made for transfer to the OR for surgical decompression and possible airway intervention. Alveolar osteitis is treated with gentle irrigation followed by packing of the socket with iodoform gauze dampened with eugenol. Consider analgesia with a nerve block before irrigation. Ensure close follow up. ANUG is treated with chlorhexidine oral rinses, analgesics, and oral antibiotics (metronidaz ole). Most patients require dental referral for definitive care. DENTAL EMERGENCIES Sublingual, submen tal, or submandibular space infection Suspected odontogenic infection Masticator space infection Consult oral surgeon for drainage Administer IV antibiotics Consult oral surgeon for drainage Administer IV antibiotics .A. Figure 78-5. Dental emergencies diagnostic algorithm. DISPOSITION Admission Patients with an open mandible fracture require admission for IV antibiotics and opera tive repair. Patients with mandible fractures also require admission for airway compromise (early intubatio n), excessive bleeding, displaced fractures, infected fractures, comorbid diseases, or if they are elderly. Patients with odontogenic deep space infections and Ludwig angina require drainage of the abscesses in a con\u00ad trolled setting. These patients require admission. Discharge Most patients with dental trauma can be discharged to follow-up with a dentist. Patients with minor odontogenic abscesses can be discharged after incision and drainage by either the treating emergency physician or a consulting oral surgeon. These patients will require oral antibiotics and follow-up. SUGGESTED READING Beaudreau RW. Oral and dental emergencies. Emergency Medicine: York, NY: 2011, pp. 1572-1583. 2011;124: 115-117.

These interventions may prevent the need for endotracheal intubation. Talk to the paramedics and family; they can often identify the cause of altered mental status (AMS). INTRODUCTION Altered mental status (AMS) may have an organic (ie, structural, biochemical, pharmac ologic) or functional (ie, psychiatric) cause. AMS accounts for So/o of emergency department (ED) visits. About 80% of patients withAMS have a systemic or metabolic cause, and about lSo/o have a structural lesion. Consciousness has 2 main components: arousal and cognition. Arousal is controlled by the ascending reticular activating system (ARAS) in the brainstem. Cognition is controlled by the cerebral cortex. Lethargy, stupor, obtun\u00ad dation, and coma are imprecise terms used to describe alterations of arousal. A description of the patient's arousal level (eg, opens eyes to voice) is preferab le. Delirium is an alteration of both arousal and cognition. Patients exhibit restlessness, agitation, and disorientation. Dementia is an alteration of cognition, not arousal. ARAS is a complex system of nuclei in the brainstem. It may be impaired by small structural lesions in the brain - stem such as ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, shear forces from head trauma, or external compression from brain herniation. Severe toxic and/or metabolic derangements ( eg, hypoxia, can also cause impair\u00ad ment. Bilateral cerebral cortex dysfunction must occur to cause decreased levels of arousal or profound AMS. This is Identify level of AMS, syst emic conditions, and any focal deficits with the physical examination. Re-examine your patients frequently and note any changes in condition and response to therapy. usually caused by toxic/metabolic derangements, infection, seizures, subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), or increased intracranial pressure (ICP). Unilateral lesions such as stroke do not by themselves cause profound AMS. CLINICAL PRESENTATION History AMS represents a spectrum of disease presentations from profoundly depressed arousal requiring emergent intuba\u00ad tion to severe agitation and confusion requiring restraint and sedation. Initial stabilizing measures are often needed before a complete history and physical examination can be performed. If the patient is unable to give a coherent history, alter\u00ad nate sources of history should be sought. Prehospital pro\u00ad viders should be questioned about the patient's condition in the field, therapies given and the resp onse, and the condition of the home environment ( eg, pill bottles, sui\u00ad cide note). Family members should be contacted to ascer\u00ad tain past history of similar episodes, medical history, trauma, substance abuse, and the last time the patient was seen in a normal state. The patient's belongings should be searched for medical identification bracelets, pill bottles, phone numbers, or other potential sources of information. 332 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS Patients presenting to the ED with AMS often include the elderly, who are more prone to infection, have comor\u00ad bid illnesses, and take multiple medicatio ns; substance abusers ( eg, heroin, cocaine, alcohol withdrawal, and liver failure); and psychiatric patients who may be on mood\u00ad stabilizing drugs, which, when taken in excess, have toxic effects that cause abnormal arousal or cognition. .... Physical Examination Vital signs; airway, breathing, and circulation (ABCs); pulse oximetry; and bedside glucose should be assessed, looking for immediate life threats and treatable causes of AMS (ie, hypoglycemia, hypoxia or abnormal respiratory hyper-or hypotension, hyper-or hypothermia). Naloxone (Narcan), glucose, and thiamine should be administered, as dictated by history and examination. A \"head-to-toe\" examination should follow, looking for systemic causes of AMS and focal neurologic deficits. The head should be examined for any signs of trauma. Pupil size, symmetry, and reactivity should be assessed. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opiate overdose or pontine hemorrhage. An uncal her\u00ad niation. Fundi should be assessed for the presence of papill\u00ad edema or subhyaloid hemorrhage associated with SAH. Neck stiffness indicates meningeal irritation caused by either SAH or infection. Cardiovascular exam should assess for dysrhythmias (atrial fibrillatio n), murmurs (endocarditis), or rubs (pericarditis). Lung exam should assess for symmet\u00ad ric breath sounds, respiratory rate, wheezes, rhonchi, and rales. Abdominal exam should assess for masses and organo\u00ad megaly (alcoholic liver disease, splenic sequestration in sickle cell disease). Skin exam should assess for color, turgor (dehydration), the neurologic examina\u00ad tion cannot be completed because of the patient's mental status, document what you are able to do and how the patient appears. Mental status assessment should include AVPU (alert, responds to voice, responds to pain, unrespon\u00ad sive). If the patient responds to voice, the appropriateness and coherence of the response should be documented. The cranial nerves, motor, deep tendon reflexes (including Babinski or plantar reflex), cerebellar, and sensory examina\u00ad tions should be included if possible. DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES .... Laboratory Multiple laboratory tests are obtained in an attempt to gain more information, although a cause can usually be ascertained from a thorough history and physical examination. Initial laboratory tests should include com\u00ad plete blood count (leukocytosis, anemia, and thrombocyt openia); chemistry (electrolyte abnormalities, acidosis, and renal failure); urine (pregnancy test, toxicology screen, infection); coagulation and liver studies (liver failure, coagulopathy) ; blood cultures (if infection suspected); arterial blood gas hypercarbia, acido\u00ad tomography ( CT) scans should be per\u00ad formed to assess for mass lesion, hydrocephalus, and intracerebral or subarachnoid bleed. Include a chest x-ray if hypoxia, abnormal respirations, or evidence of pulmonary infection is present. Electrocardiogram should be per\u00ad formed on all patients, looking for ischemia, QT or QRS prolongation, or changes consistent with electrolyte abnormalities. PROCEDURES A lumbar puncture may be indicated when considering a central nervous system infection or bleeding after a negative head CT scan. MEDICAL DECISION MAKING A systematic approach to the altered mental status patient and the recognition oftreatable causes (mnemonic AEIOU\u00ad TIPS) will provide optimal management (Figure 79-1 and Table 79-1). History, physical examination, and initial laboratory and imaging tests will often reveal the cause of mental status change. TREATMENT ED patients withAMS should be treated for any life-threatening abnormalities while ongoing patient assessment continues. Hypoglycemia, a common cause of AMS, should be treated with intravenous (N) dextrose: adults: receive oxygen therapy (administer 100% 02, mechanical ventilation as needed) while searching for a potential cause (pneumonia, congestive heart failure, pneumothorax, pulmonary embolism ).

Altered mental status diagnostic algorithm. ABCs, airway, breathing, puncture. suspected opiate should be treated naloxone 2-4 mg N given in 0.2-to 0.4-mg increments to avoid precipitating opi\u00ad ate withdrawal in chronic abusers. In a nonemergent setting, administer naloxone 2-4 mg in a nebulizer with 3 mL of saline. Pediatric patients should receive naloxone 0.01-0.1 mglkg N. Actively seizing patients should receive N benwdiazepines: diazepam 0.1-0.2 mglkg N (or 0.5 mg!kg per rectum) or lorazepam 0.1 mg!kg N. Patients with suspected meningitis or sepsis should receive N fluid resuscitation and broad\u00ad spectrum antibiotic coverage. If hypertensive encephalopathy is a suspected cause for AMS, the mean arterial pressure should be reduced by 25% in 30 minutes with N antihypertensive medications. DISPOSITION ..... Admission Most patients with AMS who are not immediately treatable require admission to the hospital for further work-up, thera\u00ad pies, and observation. The level of admission (observation unit, floor, telemetry, intensive care unit) should be guided by the patient's vital signs, reassessments in mental status, abnormalities identified, and comorbid illnesses. ALTERED MENTAL STATUS ..... Discharge Patients with hypoglycemia caused by insulin, who are able to eat and remain normoglycemic after a period of obser\u00ad vation, may be safely discharged. If on long-acting oral hypoglycemics, patients require admission for observation. For patients with narcotic overdose, discharge is appropri \u00ad ate if the patient improves with naloxone and remains stable after the duration of action of naloxone has elapsed (ie, 1-4 hours).

Weber, MD Key Points Consider emergent caus es of headache first. Have a low threshold to perform a computed tomography (CT) scan on patients with a possible emergent cause for their headache. INTRODUCTION Headache is the presenting complaint in 3-5% of all visits to the emergency department (ED). Headaches are classi\u00ad cally divided into primary headache syndromes (migraine, tension, cluster) and secondary causes, which can range from benign (sinusitis) to emergent (subarachnoid hem\u00ad intracra\u00ad nial pressure [ICP]). In clinical practice, the emergency physician attempts to classify a patient's headache as emer\u00ad gent or benign. The majority of headaches in patients presenting to the ED have a benign etiology; however, 5-10% of patients have a serious or potentially life-threat\u00ad ening cause for their headache (Table 80-1). Brain tissue is insensate. In benign headache syn\u00ad dromes, pain origina tes from blood vessels, venous Table 80-1. Headache classification by incidence. Type of Headache Tension Unknown cause Migraine Serious secondary cause Life\u00b7 threatening Incidence (%) 50 30 10 3-8 Never delay administering antibiotics while waiting for a CT scan or lumbar puncture (LP) when considering the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis. When subarachnoid hemorrhage is suspected, follow a normal CT scan with LP. sinuses, the dura, cranial nerves, or extracranial sources (muscle tension). In emergent headaches, pain may arise from mass effect (tumor or subdural hematoma), inflammation of the media, sinusitis). ...... Emergent Secondary Headaches Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Although SAH represents <1% of headaches in patients who present to the ED, it occurs in approximately 12% of patients with a severe sudden headache. Pain is often maximal at onset, in the occipital region, and may resolve spontaneously in the ED. The median age at presentation is 50 years. More than 50% of patients have a normal neurologic examination. Rupture of an aneurysm is the most common cause. Meningitis Classic triad of headache, fever, and meningismus is often not present. It is more difficult to diagnose at extremes of age. Immunosu ppression can cause atypical subacute presentations. 336 Intracranial Bleed Subdural bleed can occur with minimal or unrecognized trauma (warfarin use, elderly). Epidural bleed usually occurs with significant trauma. Intracerebral bleed is often associated with severe hypertension. Temporal Arteritis Occurs in patients older than 50 years and is more fre\u00ad quent in women. It is caused by a systemic panarteritis. Patients present with frontotemporal throbbing headache, jaw claudicati on, and a nonpulsatile or tender temporal artery. It may cause visual loss from ischemic optic neuritis. Carotid And Vertebral Artery Dissection Together these entities cause 20% of strokes in patients younger than 45 years. Carotid dissections occur twice as often as vertebral dissections. Classically, they present as acute unilateral headache and/or neck pain, but may pres\u00ad ent atypically (lower cranial nerve deficits or C5/6 radicu\u00ad lopathy). The median age of onset is 40 years. Sometimes dissection occurs in association with minor trauma (yawn\u00ad ing) or may be spontaneous. Pseudotumor Cerebri Benign intracranial hypertension of unclear cause. It has been linked to the use of oral contraceptives, vitamin A, tetracycli nes, and thyroid disorders. Often occurs in young, obese females with chronic headaches. Papilledema is usually the only abnormal examination finding, but cranial nerve abnormalit ies, visual field deficits, or decreased visual acuity may also be present. Stroke Although 55% of patients with an intracerebral hemor\u00ad rhage have a headache, less than 17% of ischemic stroke patients complain of pain. However, cerebellar infarction often presents as acute pain in the occipital area. Because of its location in the posterior fossa, there is risk of hernia\u00ad tion as thrombosis (often in the setting of a hypercoagulable state). Primary Headaches Migraine Abnormal vascular actlvtty is thought to be causal. Migraines are more common in females, with onset HEADACHE usually in teen years, and less common ly after age 40 years. The patient presents with unilateral pulsating headache that may have an associated aura. The pain usu\u00ad ally follows a typical pattern for individual patients and improves during pregnancy (estrogen excess). Associated symptoms include nausea and vomiting with photopho\u00ad bia and phonophobia. Tension The most common type of primary headache. Often pres \u00ad ents with bitemporal nonpulsating pain without associated nausea, vomiting, photophobia, or phonophobia. Cluster Uncommon in the general population, but more common in men beginning after age 20 years. They present with acute, severe, unilateral retro-orbital pain with associated lacrimation, eye injection, and rhinorrhea and usually occur in \"clusters\" over days to weeks and resolve sponta\u00ad neously. CLINICAL PRESENTATION History A detailed history is most important to make the correct diagnosis and guide therapy. Headache pattern should be sought. Patterns that raise concern for a secondary headache include sudden onset, first ever, or a change in frequency or intensity from previous. Sudden onset of a severe headache suggests SAH, but may also be present in venous sinus thrombosis, cervical artery dissection, cerebellar infarct, and pituitary apoplexy. A headache that is worse in the mornings may indicate a tumor, whereas a headache that is worse on standing is characteristic of a post-lumbar puncture (LP) headache. Headache location is usually nonspecific. However, migraines are typically unilateral, tension head\u00ad aches are bilateral, and SAH is usually occipital or nuchal. Neck pain with or without neurologic deficits may represent a carotid or vertebral artery dissection. Headache character may be pulsatile or throbbing (migraine ), squeezing (ten\u00ad sion), or sharp and acute (cluster and SAH). Associated symptoms that may point to an emergent secondary cause include syncope, altered mental status (AMS), neck pain or stiffness, fever, hypertension, visual disturbance, weakness, seizures, or trauma. Consider carbon monoxide poisoning when multiple family members are concurrently affected during the fall or win\u00ad ter. Important elements of the past medical history include immunocompromise, malignan cy, coagulop athy (warfarin), uncontrolled hypertension, artery dissection), and cerebro\u00ad vascular accident (CVA). Family history is also important. Migraines, SAH, and carotid/vertebral dissections are all more common if a first-degree relative has been affected. CHAPTER 80 ..... Physical Examination Vital signs are often normal in patients with headache. However, fever may indicate meningitis or sinusitis, and severe hypertension suggests encephalop athy or intracra\u00ad nial bleed. General appearance should be appreciated and may aid in diagnosing a life-threatening headache or severe presentation of a primary headache syndrome. Head and neck examination should assess for sinus tenderness, den\u00ad tal caries, otitis media or externa, temporal artery tender\u00ad ness, and meningismus. Eye exam should include visual acuity, reactivity and funduscopy (papilledema from increased ICP, subhyaloid hemorrhage from SAH). On the neurologic examination, include mental status, cranial nerves, strength, sensation, reflexes, cerebellar and gait if possible. AMS or focal neurologic deficits often indicate increased ICP. DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES ..... Laboratory General laboratory studies (complete blood count, chemistry panel, urinalysis) add little to the diagnosis of emergent headaches. Elevated white blood cell (WBC) count may point to an infection; elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (>50 mm/h) is present of temporal arteritis. Figure 80-1. Noncontrast head CT scan showing SAH. Note the blood (white areas) in the basal cisterns and interhemispheric fissure. This is referred to as sign\" (arrow). .... Imaging Noncontrast head computed tomography (CT) scan is the test of choice when evaluating emergent causes of head\u00ad ache. It can assess for acute SAH (sensitivity 98o/o within 12 hours, 93o/o within 24 hours); acute intracerebral, subdural, and epidural hematomas; and lesions causing mass effect (Figure 80-1). Intravenous (IV) contrast is added in patients with immunocompromise, or when subacute or chronic subdural, venous sinus thrombosis, or central ner\u00ad vous system infections are suspected. CT scan does not diagnose idiopathic intracranial hypertension, meningitis, and cases carotid angiogram of the neck, duplex ultrasonograph y, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)/magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA) of the neck should be performed. PROCEDURES LP should be performed when considering meningitis or SAH (if the head CT scan is nondiagnost ic). It can also be performed to check the opening pressure (normal <20 em H20) in patients with suspected pseudotumor cere\u00ad bri. Opening pressure should also be assessed for suspected SAH; two thirds of patients will have elevated pressure. CT should be performed before LP for patients with any of the following: age >60 years, AMS, focal neurologic deficit, signs of ICP seizures, immunoc ompromise, or meningeal signs. Cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF) findings in acute meningitis and SAH are listed in Table 80-2. Interpreting CSF results in the face of a traumatic LP can be difficult. A decrease in red blood cells (RBCs) to near zero from tubes 1-4 sug\u00ad gests that the blood in tube 1 was from LP-induced trauma, not SAH. In general, there will be 1 WBC in the CSF for every 700 RBCs when from a traumatic LP. Xanthochromia (due to lysis of erythrocytes in CSF), when present, is indicative of SAH. Table 80-2.

CSF Normal Bacterial Viral SAH Protein 15-45 High High Normal to mg/dl increased Gram stain Negative Positive Negative Negative Xanthochro mia* Negative Negative Negative Positive '''Usually present 12 hours after SAH bleed and lasts 2-3 weeks, MEDICAL DECISION MAKING History and physical examination may be sufficient to arrive at a benign diagnosis (tension, migraine, cluster headache). However, when serious secondary headaches are considered, CT imaging \u00b1 lumbar puncture should be performed. Treatment of possible meningitis should not be delayed by CT or LP (Figure 80-2). TREATMENT For patients with a presumed benign headache, oral pain medications (nonsteroidal anti-inflamma tory drug, acetaminophen, hydrocodone) may be sufficient to relieve pain. For more severe pain, especially when a migraine is sus\u00ad pected, N antiemetics (prochlorperazine 5-10 mg N) often provide relief. Sensory stimuli should be decreased (dark quiet room). N opioids may be used for continued pain. Patients with a presumed emergent headache usually require IV medications for pain relief concurrently with diagnostic tests (CT \u00b1 LP) and other treatments (N antibiotics for meningitis ). In general, N antiemetics and opioids are safe for emergent headaches. HEADACHE Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Emergent neurosurgical consultation is required for aneurysm coiling. Nimodipine ( 60 mg by mouth is often given to reduce subsequent vaso\u00ad spasm. Meningitis Do not delay antibiotics for CT scan or LP ( ceftriaxone + vancomyci n). Perform CT scan before LP if the patient meets criteria as listed previously. N steroids should be given empirically to adult patients in whom meningitis is strongly suspected. Intracranial Bleed Emergent neurosurgical consultation is required for evacu\u00ad ation of subdural or epidural bleed. Fresh-frozen plasma should be administered if the patient is coagulopathic. Severe uncontrolled hypertension should be treated. General recommendations include reduction of the mean arterial pressure by 25% or to <150/90. Complaint of headache History & physical exam Red flags present? Benign headache Treat symptoms and refer A. Figure Temporal Arteritis Administer oral prednisone 80 mg. The patient should be discharged home on prednisone 40 mg daily. Close follow-up for biopsy and definitive diagnosis should be arranged before the patient is discharged from the ED. Pseudotumor Cerebri A normal CT scan should be followed by LP to assess opening pressure. An opening pressure >25 em H20 sug\u00ad gests the diagnosis. CSF should be removed to bring ICP into the normal range (usually about 20 mL of CSF). Oral acetazolamide and steroids may be started in the ED after consulting with a neurologist. Carotid or Vertebral Artery Dissection For patients with only pain and no neurologic signs suggestive of CVA, head CT scan is often normal. CT angiography of neck, MRI/MRA, or duplex ultrasound may show the abnormality in the affected vessel. Treatment may include aspirin or heparin. Emergent neurologic and vascular surgery consultation is appropriate. DISPOSITION Admission Most patients with an emergent secondary headache should be admitted to the hospital. Patients with meningitis with AMS, SAH, intracranial hemorrhage, cervical artery dissectio n, or tumor with mass effect or signs of increased ICP should be admitted to an intensive care unit. Discharge Patients with benign headache syndromes whose pain is well controlled can be discharged home. Patients with sec\u00ad ondary headaches that are not life-or organ-threatening (temporal arteritis, cerebri) can be dis\u00ad charged home after close follow-up is arranged. These patients should be given very specific instructions to return if headache worsens or they experience any new or different symptoms, including focal weakness, numbness, speech or visual problems, or vomiting.

Lauth, MD Key Points The patient's definition of \"dizziness\" must be clarified with a careful and explicit history taken by the health care provider. True vertigo must be differentiated from other types of dizziness. INTRODUCTION Dizziness is one of the most common emergency depart\u00ad ment (ED) presentations and one of the most difficult to characterize. Dizziness means different things to different people and crosses language and cultural boundaries. The precise definition ranges from weakness, giddiness, and anxiety to true vertigo, presyncope, disequilibrium, or nonspecific lightheadedness. A very careful history from the patient, friends, or family is the most important part of the initial evaluation of the dizzy patient. Dizziness can be divided into 4 main types: vertigo, presyncope, disequilibrium, and lightheadedness. Vertigo is defined as the perception of movement where no move\u00ad ment exists. Patients often describe feeling the room spin\u00ad ning. It can be further divided into central and peripheral types. Peripheral vertigo is usually benign and caused by an inner ear problem, whereas central vertigo is usually serious and involves pathology within the cerebellum or brainstem. Presyncope is defined as lightheadedness derived from feel\u00ad ing an impending loss of consciousness. Disequilibrium refers to a feeling of unsteadiness, imbalance, or a sensation of floating while walking. Lightheadedness is the most dif\u00ad ficult type of dizziness to characterize. Many patients in this group have vague, poorly defined symptoms, such as just not feeling right, that do not fall into one of the other categories. 341 Attempt to distinguish peripheral from central vertigo. Consider life-threatening causes of dizziness such as cardiac syncope and cerebellar inf arct or hemorrhage in all patients, especially the elderly. The central nervous system (CNS) coordinates and interprets sensory inputs from visual, vestibular, and pro\u00ad prioceptive systems. These 3 systems give us the sense of position in our 3-dimensional universe. The disruption of any 1 of these 3 can produce vertigo. The most common forms of vertigo involve dysfunction of the vestibular appa\u00ad ratus and are thus considered peripheral vertigo. By far the most common cause of vertigo is benign paroxysmal posi\u00ad tional vertigo (BPPV), which is caused by a mechanical disorder of the inner ear. It is due to the accumulation of floating calcium carbonate particles in either the left or right semicircular canals. These particles stimulate the laby\u00ad rinth, causing asymmetric input from the normal and affected semicircular canals, which produces the sensation of vertigo. Clinically, BPPV is characterized by vertigo pre\u00ad cipitated by certain head movements, which aggravate this unilateral dysfunction. Other causes of peripheral vertigo include Meniere disease, labyrinthitis, and vestibular neu\u00ad ronitis. Meniere disease is a disorder in which there is an increase in volume and pressure of the endolymph of the inner ear, eventually leading to damage of the endolym\u00ad phatic system and deafness. The pathophysiology of laby\u00ad rinthitis is not completely understood, although many cases are associated with systemic or viral illnesses, which is thought to cause inflammation in the vestibular apparatus. Viral infection of the vestibular nerve is believed to be the most common cause of vestibular neuronitis. CHAPTER 81 Central vertigo is much less common than peripheral vertigo and is due to CNS dysfunction. Cerebellar infarct cerebellopontine angle and vertebrobasilar insufficiency frequently cause central vertigo symptoms. CLINICAL PRESENTATION History The cause of dizziness can be elicited by history alone in more than half of all cases. Patients with vertigo complain of a sensation of movement, or \"the room spinning\" around them, with associated nausea and vomiting. BPPV usually has an abrupt onset, lasts < 1 minute, and is pro\u00ad voked by head movement. ED physicians should be aware that some causes of central vertigo such as vertebrobasilar insufficiency (VBI), transient ischemic attack, and cerebel\u00ad lar hemorrhage may also have an acute onset. Meniere disease is associated with hearing loss and tinnitus, and the vertigo usually lasts for hours. The vertigo caused by laby\u00ad rinthitis and vestibular neuronitis usually lasts for a few days. In contradistinction, the symptoms of central vertigo are usually less acute, more persistent, and may have asso\u00ad ciated neurologic symptoms (Table 81-1). Patients with presyncope often complain of feeling as though they are going to pass out. This may be associated with a stressful event (vasovagal episode), exertion (aortic stenosis), sudden change in posture (hypovol emia), or Table 81-1. Differentiating peripheral from central vertigo.

Disequilibrium is most often a complaint of elderly patients. Their sense ofloss of balance is usually worse at night (limited visual acuity is further impaired) and later in the day (more fatigued). Patients with lightheadedness usually have vague complaints. Past medical history and associated chronic medical conditions should be ascertained in an attempt to find a cause for their complaints. Physical Examination A complete physical examination should be performed, paying special attention to a few key areas. Vital signs can suggest a cause early in the evaluation. Hypotension sug\u00ad gests causes related to decreased cerebral perfusion, whereas hypertension may point to VBI, stroke, or hemor\u00ad rhage. Bradycardia or tachycardia may cause presyncope from impaired cardiac output. The head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination may reveal a possible cause for vertigo. Ears should be carefully examined for presence of a ruptured tympanic membrane, decreased hearing, infection, cerumen impaction, and for\u00ad eign bodies. The cardiovascular examination should assess for signs of vascular insufficiency (carotid bruits, decreased murmur of aortic stenosis. A complete neurologic examination is essential for all patients with a complaint of dizziness. Assess for the pres\u00ad ence and type of nystagmus. While performing the cranial nerve examination, pay special attention to cranial nerves VII, VIII, and IX. Cranial neuropathies associated with era\u00ad nial nerve VIII suggest brainstem involvement and a central cause of vertigo. Patients with peripheral vertigo should be able to ambulate, although they may veer to one side. Patients with cerebellar infarction or hemorrhage usually cannot ambulate. A Romberg test can be used to differenti\u00ad ate cerebellar from spinal cord (posterior column) dysfunc\u00ad tion. Have the patient stand, with feet together, and then have them close their eyes. Excessive swaying or imbalance is a positive test and is seen in patients with significant pro\u00ad prioceptive loss from posterior column dysfunction. DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES Laboratory No specific laboratory test can aid in the diagnosis of ver\u00ad tigo (Table 81-2). However, older patients on multiple medications with nonspecific symptoms should have hemoglobin, electrolytes, and renal function evaluated. Electrocardiogram (ECG) and serial troponins should be performed in patients suspected of having a cardiac cause for their symptoms. Imaging Head computed tomography (CT) scan is indicated in patients with a suspected central cause for their symptoms (focal neurologic findings, altered mental status, severe Table 81-2.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)/ magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) may be per\u00ad formed if vertebral artery dissection or vertebrobasilar insufficiency is considered. PROCEDU RES The Dix-Hallpike maneuver can be used to elicit BPPVand differentiate it from a central cause for vertigo. The proce\u00ad dure involves rapidly moving the patient from a seated to supine position with the head rotated 45 degrees to the right with the eyes open. If no symptoms are elicited, the procedure should be repeated with the head rotated to the left. The latency, duration, and direction of nystagmus and presence of vertigo should be noted. With BPPV, the nystagmus is horizontal or rotatory, has a latency period (up to 60 seconds), is fatigable, and suppresses with fixation (Figure 81-2). MEDICAL DECISION MAKING The ED evaluation of dizziness requires a broad differen\u00ad tial diagnosis encompassing benign diagnoses such as laby\u00ad rinthitis associated with an upper respiratory infection to DIZZINESS .A. Figure 81-1. CT scan showing cerebellopontine angle tumor (acoustic neuroma). life-threatening emergencies such as cerebellar infarct or hemorrhage. The history and physical examination may lead to a diagnosis or point toward the need for further ED evaluation and possible admission (Figure 81-3). TREATMENT The treatment of patients with dizziness in the ED is dictated by the working diagnosis after evaluation. Peripheral vertigo is treated based on the suspected cause. BPPV can be treated in the ED with canalith repositioning maneuvers. The Epley maneuver is used to reposition the particulate debris from the semicircular canal to the utricle (Figure 81-4). Once the debris is repositioned, the abnor\u00ad mal vestibular input is eliminated. Multiple attempts at this procedure may be necessary. Vestibular suppressant medications are also used to decrease abnormal input from the affected semicircular canal (Table 81-3). For other Table 81-3.

Within several seconds, this elicits vertigo and nystagmus that is right beating with a rotary (counterclockwise) component.

Patients with vertigo from central causes ( CNS tumor, bleed, or infarct) should have appropriate neurology or neurosurgical consultation in the ED. Patients su spected of having vertebrobasilar insufficiency should be started on aspirin, and follow-up (inpatient vs outpatient) decisions should be made in consultation with their primary physician. Patients with cardiovascular risk factors and presyncope are treated similar to patients with syncope and may require a telemetry admission to exclude an arrhythmia (see Chapter 19, Syncope). Patients found to have noncardiac causes of presyncope, such as dehydration or anemia, are treated accordingly with fluids and/or blood transfusion. Patients with symptoms of disequilibrium or nonspe\u00ad cific lightheadedness with an unremarkable ED evaluation may be discharged home after consultation with their primary physician. As the majority of these patients are elderly, patients should be assessed for fall risk and home safety before discharge. Vestibular suppressants should never be used in these patients because these drugs can exacerbate their symptoms.

Cerebrovascular Accident Tom Morrissey, MD Key Points Time is brain. Time of symptom onset is key to acute stroke treatment. Hypoglycemia and hypoxia can mimic stroke. Assess and treat these conditions early in the evaluation of patients with stroke-like symptoms. INTRODUCTION Roughly 750,000 strokes occur annually in the United States, and this will increase as the population ages. Physical, emo\u00ad tional, and economic damages are multifactorial. The cost of initial care is only the beginning. Many stroke s urvivors are not only unable to return to work, they are unable to care for themselves, placing heavy demands on family and friends. Stroke is defined as a neurologic deficit resulting from the interruption of blood supply to neuronal tissue. The brain is highly metabolically active, consuming roughly 25% of cardiac output, but has no mechanism for storing energy reserves. This makes it extremely sensitive to even transient interruption in its supply of oxygen and glucose. Vascular oomprornise may be caused by several different mechanisms, but the final oommon pathway is impaired neuronal perfusion and tissue starvation. Strokes are often classified in 2 different ways: etiology and location. Etiologic causes can be classified as either hemorrhagic or ischemic. Hemorrhagic strokes account for 10-20% of all strokes. They sometimes result from the rup\u00ad ture of an aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation (AVM), usually causing bleeding on the surface of the brain. More commonly, the bleeding comes from disruption of an intra\u00ad cerebral arteriole, leading to bleeding inside the parenchyma of the brain. Uncontrolled hypertension is the most common precipitant of intracerebral bleeding, but other Resist the urge to aggressively lower blood pressure. Hy\u00ad pertension is the body's attempt to maintain perfusion to ischemic tissue. Hypotension can make things worse. Transient ischemic attack (TIA) is a warning of a stroke to come (aborted stroke). Treat TIAs seriously and work up risk factors expediently. conditions such as amyloidosis and tumors can increase the chances of intracerebral bleeding. Vasospasm can occur from the irritant effects of blood on the surface of the brain, leading to an even greater decrease in blood flow. Ischemic strokes are caused primarily by thrombosis of a blood vessel, very similar to mechanisms involved in myo\u00ad cardial infarction. Conditions such as atherosclerosis, are common precipitants. About ischemic strokes result from embolic phenomenon. The carotid bifurcation is a common source of plaque embolism. Cardiac mural throm\u00ad bus and valve disease are also likely sources of embolism. Classification by location depends on the blood vessel or vascular distribution involved (Table 82-1). The blood supply to the brain comes from paired carotid and vertebral blood vessels. The carotid distribution (ie, anterior circulation) sup\u00ad plies primarily cerebral and cortical structures, whereas the vertebrobasilar vascular distribution (ie, posterior circulation) feeds the cerebellum and brainstem structures. The involved vessel can often be inferred from the clinical presentation. Carotid circulation strokes commonly present with motor and sensory deficits that are fairly obvious. Visual field defects, neglect, and language difficulties (eg, aphasia) are often appar\u00ad ent on exam. The internal carotid bifurcates into the anterior carotid artery (ACA), which feeds areas involved in control of the leg, and the middle carotid artery (MCA), which feeds areas 347 CHAPTER 82 Table 82-1.

Smaller branches penetrate deeper into areas such as the internal capsule. Strokes in these vessels can give pure sensory or motor deficits. Vertebrobasilar strokes cause ischemia in the brainstem or cerebellum. Large brainstem strokes are usually fatal. Smaller ones can lead to cranial nerve dysfunction and more subtle findings, such as vertigo_ Cerebellar strokes can be much harder to recognize, emphasizing the importance oflooking for ataxia, balance, and fine motor control on the neurologic exam. These signs are often not noticed by the patients themselves. Until the mid 1990s, the treatment for acute ischemic stroke was almost entirely supportive care. In 1996, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the use of tissue plasminogen activator (TPA). Some facilities are employing intravascular catheter-guided clot lysis or evacu\u00ad ation. With the availability of these newer treatments, stroke patients now rank as true medical emergencies that warrant the focused resources of the emergency department (ED). With the time dependency of treatment options, much work has gone into increasing public awareness of stroke and enhancing prehospital recognition and transport. Many hospitals have developed dedicated stroke teams and stroke protocols to expedite care of acute stroke patients. Transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) are defined as \"a tran\u00ad sient episode neurologic Dysarthria Pure hemisensory deficit Dysarthria Ataxia on same side as weakness brain, spinal cord or retinal ischemia, without acute infarc\u00ad tion.\" Symptoms typically last less than 1-2 hours. These patients should be assessed and treated as acute strokes, with the exception of fibrinolytic treatment. TIAs are the equiva\u00ad lent of unstable angina in coronary disease and should be treated as \"warning signs of strokes to come.\" Some studies estimate as many as 20% of TIA patients will suffer a stroke within 90 days, half of which may occur within 48 hours. CLINICAL PRESENTATION History Reperfusion strategies are both time-and situation-dependant. Gathering accurate historical information as quickly as possi\u00ad ble is a critical facet of treatment_ Issues such as aphasia and cognitive dysfunction can make it very difficult to get infor\u00ad mation directly from the patient. Make efforts to contact others (family, nursing home staff) who can provide historical details. Hemineglect and gaze deviation may cause patients not to be aware of you. Be sure you are in the patient's line of sight and touch them while you are talking to them. One of the most important historical considerations is to determine when the symptoms began. If the patient had symptoms on awakening, or cannot clearly identify the time they started, the start time is considered the last time the CEREBROVASCULAR ACCIDENT patient was seen as normal. The \"time last known well\" is important to obtain early because it will determine whether fibrinolytics will be considered. The window to administer fibrinolytics intravenously (IV) is usually an onset of symp\u00ad toms within the last 3 hours. If fibrinolytics are being consid\u00ad ered, ask about contraindications to their administration. Is there a history of previous intracranial bleeding? Brain tumor? Head injury? Recent surgery? Is the patient on anticoagulants? Ask the patient how he or she noticed the symptoms and what he or she was doing when it started. Is the patient dizzy, off balance, or falling? Is the patient having pain or weakness or both? Has the patient had these symptoms before? Extremity pain is an unusual feature of a stroke and suggests an alternate diagnosis. Onset of symptoms with severe headache, seizure, and syncope suggests a hemor\u00ad rhage stroke. Neck pain or history of neck trauma or manipulation may indicate carotid or vertebral dissection. When assessing the past medical history , determine whether a stroke mimic is possible. Diabetic patients may be presenting with hypoglycemia. Patients with a history of seizures may be postictal. Patients with a history of migraines may also present with stroke- like symptoms. Lastly, elicit risk factors for stroke. Atrial fibrillation and valvular disease are common risk factors for emboli. Diabetes and hypertension are risk factors for thrombotic strokes. ..... Physical Examination As with history, extensive physical exam should not delay imaging and treatment. Focus on the airway, breathing, and circulation (ABCs) and pertinent neurologic findings. Of greatest importance is the patient's ability to protect his or her airway. Either decreased mental status or cranial nerve dysfunction can compromise airway protect ion. Check for spontaneous swallowing. Do not test gag reflex as this may induce vomitin g. Note the patient's vital signs and breathing pattern. Low blood pressure can mimic stroke symptoms. High blood pres\u00ad sure may be a cause or compensation. If you choose to lower blood pressure later, it will be important to know the present\u00ad ing baseline pressure. Cheyne-Stokes or apneustic breathing may indicate severe brain injury. Hypoxia can cause stroke\u00ad like symptoms in the absence of a actual vascular occlusion. Other important questions to answer on the physical examination include the following. Is the rhythm irregular (atrial fibrillat ion)? Are there murmurs to indicate valvular disease? Is there peripheral evidence of emboli (splinter hemorrhages in nails, on the retina)? Are carotid pulses palpable? Is there a bruit, indicating possible dissection or plaque as a source of emboli? Is there a fever? CNS infections can be confused with stroke. Hypotension from sepsis can cause hypoperfusion and mimic stroke. Is there evidence of head trauma or other injury? Neurologic examination need not be comprehensi ve initially. Tools such as the National Institute of Health stroke scale (NIHSS) are available to \"quantify\" the extent of the stroke and are widely available (Table 82-2). Table 82-2.

Focus on key components, including: Level of consciousness. Is the patient alert, lethargic, obtunded, or stuporous? Rapid decline may indicate herniation. Eye exam. Asymmetric pupils may indicate herniation or midbrain Papilledema intracranial pressure or encephalop athy. Retinal hemorrhages or pale spots indicate emboli. Is there a gaze deviation? Is there evidence of nystagmus? Cranial nerve exam. The brainstem is a tightly packed area, and it is extremely rare to have a stroke that involves only one cranial nerve. Cranial nerve palsies on one side of the body and contralateral motor/sensory findings are a hallmark ofbrainstem strokes. Motor exam. Assess for asymmetric weakness and classify as normal, weak, or not moving at all. Check to see if the deficit is greater in the face/arm distribution (MCA) or the leg (ACA) or both (carotid bifurcati on). Checking for pro\u00ad nator drift is a sensitive test for subtle weakness. Sensory exam. Compare sensation to pain and light touch bilaterally. The sensory exam is often limited by neglect, receptive aphasia, or mental status. Subtle sensory deficits may be uncovered by checking for extinction to bilateral simultaneous light touch on the arms, legs, and face. Reflexes. Initially reflexes are decreased in the involved regions. Hyperreflexia may indicate old strokes. Assess for asymmetric release reflexes such as a Babinski sign or myo\u00ad clonic jerking when feet are pushed dorsally. Cerebellar exam. If safe, have the patient walk. Look for wide or narrow gait and perform a Romberg test. Check for smooth controlled finger-to -nose, knee-heel-shin, and rapid alternating movements to test cerebellar fine motor control. DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES Imaging Noncontrasted head CT is currently the test of choice for the initial evaluation of stroke patients. Most acute strokes are not visible on CT. Its role is not to \"rule in stroke;' but rather to rule out other entities that would be a con train\u00ad dication to fibrinolytic reperfusion therapy. Bleeding is an obvious contraindication to fibrinolytics. Large strokes that show early ischemic changes (edema) on the CT scan are more likely to convert to hemorrhagic strokes and thus are a relative contraindication to fibrinolytic treatment. Plain CT is very sensitive for bleeding or mass effects from other intracranial lesions (Figure 82-1 and 82-2). Laboratory Important lab studies include rapid blood glucose and coag\u00ad ulation studies (prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time). These must be ordered as quickly as possible after Figure 82-1. CT scan showing an ischemic stroke. Note the hypodense area anterior and to the right of the fourth ventricle (arrow). Figure 82-2. CT scans showing hemorrhagic stroke (arrow). patient arrival. Other common tests include complete blood count, electrolytes, and renal function. Electrocardiogram and cardiac enzymes are often ordered to assess for cardiac causes of the event. CEREBROVASCULAR ACCIDENT PROCEDU RES No special procedures are required in stroke patients. It is important, however, to avoid doing procedures that could complicate the course of fibrinolytic treatment. Any central lines should be placed in areas where bleeding can be monitored and controlled with compression (jugular or femoral, not subclavian ). Peripheral IVs are preferred. Do not perform a lumbar puncture unless there is a strong suspicion of subarachnoid hemorrhage or meningitis as the cause of symptoms. MEDICAL DECISION MAKING The first decision that should be considered with an isch\u00ad ernie stroke is eligibility for fibrinolytic reperfusion ther\u00ad apy (Figure 82-3). Critical factors include the following: 1. Is this truly an ischemic stroke (vs hemorrhagic or other stroke mimic)? 2. Is the time of the onset of symptoms clear? 3. Are there exclusion factors? 4. Is your institution capable of TPA administration, or do you need to transfer the patient to a stroke center?

Limit further damage by paying atten\u00ad tion to the details of supportive care. Intubate if the patient is unable to protect his or her airway. Provide s upplemen\u00ad tal oxygen for hypoxia (generally for 0 2 sats <95%; there is some evidence that hyperoxia can worsen neuronal damage by free radical oxidation). In addition, administer IV fluids if the patient appears hypovolemic or is hypotensive. Aim for euvolemia; volume overload can worsen cerebral edema. Severely anemic patients may need blood transfu\u00ad sion to assure good oxygen-carrying capability. Be very cautious lowering blood pressure, if you lower it at all. Hypotension is much worse than hyperten sion. Blood pressure control for ischemic strokes is not warranted unless pressures are sustained above 220/120 mmHg. Blood pressure control for hemorrhagic strokes has less evidence, but many recommend controlling any blood pressure over 150/90 mmHg. Ischemic Strokes For patients with ischemic strokes or TIA, aspirin (325 mg orally) helps prevent platelet aggregation. Do not give until you assure that the patient does not have an intracranial hemorrhage. If you think the patient might receive fibrino\u00ad lytics, hold the aspirin for the first 24 hours. Consult a neurologist and/or stroke team whenever available. If fibri\u00ad nolytic therapy is administered, the FDA-approved dose is Reteplase (rTPA) 0.9 mg/kg (max dose 90 mg). Ten percent should be administered as a bolus, with the remainder of the infusion over the next hour. Intensive care monitoring is need for the first 24 hours after treatment. Any worsen\u00ad ing of condition should prompt immediate cessation of the infusion and repeat head CT. Hemorrhagic Stroke Mitigate elevated intracranial pressure by elevating the head of the bed to 30 degrees. Treat coagulopa thy. Patients on warfarin with high international normalized ratios should be reversed with fresh-frozen plasma or prothrom\u00ad bin complex concentrate and vitamin K. Do not give aspmn. Consult neurosurger y. Many intracerebral clots will benefit from early clot evacuation. Implement seizure precautions and consider antiepileptic administration in consultation with the admitting team. DISPOSITION Admission All stroke patients should be admitted to the hospital. Patients with large strokes, evidence of edema on CT scan, or decreases in mental status are at high risk for decom\u00ad pensation and should be admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU). All patients who receive fibrinolytic therapy should be monitored in the ICU for the first 24 hours after treat\u00ad ment. Patients with evidence of arrhythmias or other car\u00ad diac causes for the stroke should be admitted to a monitored setting. Patients with hemorrha gic strokes should be admitted to an ICU setting with neurosurgical consultation. In many hospitals, this will mean transfer to a facility with higher levels of care. Patients with TIA symptoms should be admitted to the hospital for an expe\u00ad dited evaluation. Discharge Stable patients with obvious nonstroke etiologies may be discharged home if other medical conditions do not war\u00ad rant admission. Ensure that the patient has a safe social situation and appropriate follow-up. SUGGESTED READING Go S, Worman DJ. Stroke, transient ischemic attack and cervical artery dissection.

Seizures and Status Epilepticus Amer Zia Aldeen, MD Alison R. Foster, MD Key Points Always check a bedside glucose level in seizure patients. Monitor airway, breathing, and circulation in actively seizing patients and intervene when needed. INTRODUCTION A seizure is an episode of abnormal neurologic function caused by inappropriate, excessive activation of neurons in the brain. Seizures account for up to 2% of emergency depart\u00ad ment (ED) visits and affect approximately 4 million people in the United States. The incidence of seizures is highest among those <20 and >60 years of age. Status epilepticus is continu\u00ad ous or intermittent seizure activity for more than 5 minutes without recovery of consciousness. It has a mortality rate of up to 20%. Half of all patients presenting to the ED in status epilepticus have no prior history of seizures. ED management of seizures should focus on cessation of seizure activity. Seizures result from abnormal excitation or lack of inhi\u00ad bition of neurons in the brain. The cause may be primary (idiopathic) or secondary, with an underlying etiology that may be treatable such as hypoglycemia. In patients with a known seizure disorder, the most common cause of recur\u00ad rent seizures includes medication noncompliance, sleep deprivation, alcohol or substance withdrawal, and infec\u00ad tion. Secondary causes of seizures include head trauma, stroke, intracranial infection or mass, electrolyte abnor\u00ad malities, alcohol withdrawal, drug overdose, and eclampsia. Seizures are classified as generalized or partial. Generalized seizures are characterized by excitation of the entire cerebral cortex and always cause alteration of mental status. Generalized seizures can manifest as a staring spell Intravenous lorazepam is the drug of choice for actively seizing patients. Search for a secondary cause of seizures in first-time seizure patients and those with a known seizure disorder who have new or different features. (absence or petit mal), diffuse motor activity (tonic-clonic or grand mal), or drop attacks (myoclonic, tonic, clonic, or atonic). The postictal period refers to the time (lasting up to 1 hour) after a generalized seizure when the patient gradually returns to baseline mental status. The postictal period often distinguishes generalized seizures from other causes of sudden altered mental status such as syncope. Partial seizures are caused by localized neuronal activation that may remain localized or spread to involve other areas of the brain (referred to as partial seizure with seconda ry gen\u00ad eralization) . Patients with simple partial seizures experience brief focal motor or sensory symptoms without altered mental status. Complex partial seizures are characterized by altered consciousness with autonomic, sensory, motor, and/ or psychological manifestations (Table 83-1). CLINICAL PRESENTATION History While the history is performed, obtain a blood glucose level in all patients with altered mental status, including those suspected of having had a seizure. Hypoglycemic seizures are easily treated with dextrose and do not respond to stan\u00ad dard antiepileptic drugs. To determine whether a seizure actually occurred, gather a complete and detailed history from witnesses, emergency medical service, and the patient. 353 Table 83-1. Classification of seizures. Generalized Seizures (always loss of consciousne ss) Tonic-clonic seizures (grand mal) Absence seizures (petit mal) Myoclonic seizures Clonic seizures Atonic seizures Partial (focal) Seizures Simple partial (no alteration of consciousness) Complex partial (impaired consciousness) CHAPTER 83 Partial seizures (simple or complex) with secondary generalization Note the onset of symptoms, the presence of a prodrome or aura, loss of consciousness, diffuse or focal motor activity, bowel or bladder incontinence, length of the event, and postictal period. Ask about recent trauma (head injury), headaches (mass lesions), pregnancy (eclampsia), history of metabolic abnormalities such as diabetes (hypoglycemia), drug ingestions (tricyclic-antidepressants, isoniazid), alco\u00ad hol use (withdrawal seizure), and sleep disturbances. If the patient has a known seizure disorder, obtain a description of the patient's typical seizure pattern and medication history. ..... Physical Examination As with any high-acuity patient, perform a primary survey of the patient, assessing airway, breathing, and circulation (ABCs), vital signs, bedside glucose level, basic mental status, and pupillary symmetry and reactivity. In most patients, the seizure will stop spontaneously within 2 minutes, and the initial postictal period will result in profound alteration of mental status. At this time, manage the airway by using jaw thrust/chin lift, repositioning the patient's head, or inserting a nasopharyngeal air way. Look for physical examination signs of toxidromes ( eg, Cushing reflex), and any focal neurologic abnormality that would indicate a secondary cause of sei\u00ad zure. A complete neurologic examination should be per\u00ad formed as soon as possible. Transient focal muscle paralysis after a seizure is known as Todd paralysis and usually resolves within 24-48 hours. Up to 25% of patients with a generalized seizure sustain a tongue laceration, usually of the lateral tongue. Tongue biting has a 99% specificity and 24% sensitivity for diagnosis of generalized tonic-clonic seizure. DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES ..... Laboratory In addition to an immediate bedside glucose for all seizure patients, check the sodium level in patients with first-time seizures. All women of child-bearing age should have a preg\u00ad nancy test. In patients with significant comorbid illnesses such as renal failure, broaden laboratory testing to include renal function tests, complete blood count, alcohol, calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus levels. To differentiate between true seizures and pseudoseizures (also known as psycho\u00ad genic nonepileptic lactate, and electrolytes. Elevated serum prolactin level within 60 minutes of seizure onset can support the diagnosis of sei\u00ad zure. Addition ally, an increased lactate level and anion gap with decreased bicarbonate suggests generalized seizure activity. This metabolic acidosis should resolve within 1 hour of seizure cessation. Patients with a known seizure disorder should have antiepileptic medication levels checked. .... Imaging Obtain a noncontrast brain computed tomography (CT) scan in all patients with first-time seizure or those with a change in their normal seizure pattern. Other indications to perform CT include patients with a new focal neurologic deficit, severe headache, persistent altered mental status, fever, trauma, cancer, anticoagulant use, or history of immunocom\u00ad prornise (Figure 83-1). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is more sensitive for mass lesions such as vascular malforma\u00ad tions, certain tumors, and strokes, but is not usually necessary in the ED setting. Patients with a known seizure disorder and a typical seizure without any new secondary causes identified do not need any imaging performed in the ED . .A. Figure 83-1. Head CT scan of a patient from Mexico who presented to the ED with a first-time seizure. CT scan demonstrated multiple calcifications from neurocysticercosis. SEIZURES AND STATUS EPILEPTICUS Consider lumbar puncture in the setting of seizure if the patient is febrile, immunoc ompromised, or at high risk for subarachnoid hemorrhage despite normal CT findings. Lumbar puncture is not a routine part of first-time seizure evaluation. Electroencephalogram (EEG) is indicated in the ED only when nonconvulsive status epilepticus is suspected in patients with persistent altered mental status or in patients who receive paralytics or phenobarbital, both of which may mask continued seizure activity. MEDICAL DECISION MAKING Once normal vital signs, blood glucose, and mental status have been achieved, a patient's seizure history determines the management pathway. If the present seizure is typical of past seizure patterns, antiepileptic drug levels should be obtained and repleted. If any part of the seizure was atypical or this was a first-time seizure, the patient should be evalu\u00ad ated for secondary causes. If no secondary cause is identi\u00ad fied and the seizure was an isolated event, the remainder of the evaluation can occur as an outpatient (Figure 83-2). Discharge for outpatient follow-up if no secondary cause identified TREATMENT Specific management is based on the patient's clinical sce\u00ad nario. ..... First-Time Seizure, Resolved Patients with a first-time seizure who have a normal neu\u00ad rologic examination, no medical comorbidities, normal diagnostic testing including a normal CT brain scan, and normal electrolytes do not require further treatment in the ED. Patients with seizures attributed to other causes (sec\u00ad ondary seizures) will need specific treatment for the underlying etiology. ..... Known Seizure Disorder, Resolved If antiepileptic drug levels are very low, begin repletion in the ED. Simply resuming home dosing in these cases delays therapeutic levels for several days. Phenytoin can be loaded either intravenously (IV) or by mouth (PO) at 18 mg/kg. IV loading results in therapeutic serum levels within Atypical (trauma, fever, headache, AMS) Check anticonvulsant levels Load subtherapeutic anticonvulsants; discharge home with outpatient follow-up Figure 83-2. Seizures and status epilepticus diagnostic algorithm. AMS, altered mental status; CT, computed tomography. CHAPTER 83 1 hour, and oral loading within 12 hours. In patients with subtherapeutic levels, the correct amount of phenytoin to administer is determined by the following formula: Phenytoin load (mg) = (0.75 L/kg) x (desired level-current level) x (patient's weight in kg) An alternative to phenytoin administration is fosphe\u00ad nytoin given Nor intramus cu\u00ad larly (IM) and has fewer side effects but is more expensive. ..... Actively Seizing Patient The mainstays of treatment are to protect the patient from physical injury; reduce the risk of aspiration; moni\u00ad tor ABCs, vital signs, and bedside glucose; and observe the seizure for resolution. There isno indication for IV anticonvulsant medications as most are self-limited. Benzodiazepines are used for patients with frequent or continuous seizures to tem\u00ad porarily subdue seizure activity until a permanent solu\u00ad tion is determined. Administer lorazepam 2 mg N or IM (up to a total dose of 0.1 mg/kg) or diazepam (0.1 mg/kg/ dose) to control seizure activity. Multiple studies have shown that lorazepam and diazepam are both equally effective at terminating seizures, although lorazepam administration decreases the occurrence of repeat sei\u00ad zures when compared to diazepam. If the seizure does not resolve or the patient does not return to baseline between events, treat for status epilepticus. ..... Status Epilepticus Administer medications in stepwise fashion until seizure activity ceases. Benzodiazepines remain first-line agents (see preceding doses) with the addition of antiepileptic drugs as second- be loaded IV depending on availability in ED. Fosphenytoin is preferred as it can be loaded faster. If seizure activity persists, phenobarbital is a third-line agent and is dosed at 20 mg/kg. Phenobarbital administra\u00ad tion will result in profound respiratory depression, so a definitive airway should be secured at this time. Valproic acid (20 mg/kg) can be used instead of phenobarbital as a ultation should be obtained (Figure 83-3). ..... Special Cases Seizures In HIV Patient Seizures are a common manifestation of central nervous sys\u00ad tem (CNS) disease lopathy, CNS lymphoma, and many opportunistic infections can cause seizures. In this population, lumbar puncture should be performed with standard tests as well as specific assays for tubercular, viral, and fungal agents. Neurocysticercosis Neurocysticercosis is caused by the parasite Taenia solium and is the most common cause of secondary epilepsy in the developing world. CT may show 1-to 2-cm cystic lesions within the cerebral cortex. Definitive diagnosis depends on the clinical picture, serologic testing, and imaging. Noncontrast studies demonstrate calcification of inactive cysts, which is the most common finding at presentation (see Figure 83-1). In patients with active disease, contrast CT demonstrates ring enhancement signifying edemas ur\u00ad rounding the active cysts. Seizures due to neurocysticerco\u00ad sis are usually controlled by antiepileptic monotherapy until definitive antiparasitic medication and/or surgical excision is successful. Pregnancy Test all female patients of child-bearing age for pregnanc y. Pregnant patients with proteinuria, hypertension, and sei\u00ad zure likely have eclampsia. The treatment is N magnesium sulfate 4-to 6-g bolus followed by a 2-g hourly infusion. Eclamptic seizures can occur postpartum and the treat\u00ad ment is the same. Alcohol Withdrawal Alcohol withdrawal seizures can occur in those with chronic alcohol dependence and are most likely to occur 12-36 hours after last alcohol intake. Benzodiazepines administered on arrival have been shown to prevent sequential seizures. It is important to remember that alco\u00ad hol withdrawal seizures are a diagnosis of exclusion, and other secondary etiologies should be investigated. Isoniazid Patients undergoing treatment for tuberculosis are often taking isoniazid, which can cause seizures resulting from vitamin B6 deficiency . The typical presentation will be sei\u00ad zures unresponsi ve to conventional treatment for status epilepticus. The treatment is N vitamin B 6 (pyridoxin e). Dose-dependent algorithms are available for treatment; empiric therapy if the dose of isoniazid is unknown is 5 g of B6 IV, which can be repeated. DISPOSITION ..... Admission Patients in status epilepticus should be admitted to an intensive care unit. Patients with a first-time resolved seizure with an identified secondary cause should be admitted to the hospital for further evaluation. Patients with a known seizure disorder and atypical features should undergo further work-up and may warrant admission.

Trauma Principles jorge Fernandez, MD Neil Rifenbark, MD Key Points Assess all trauma patients with a rapid primary survey followed by a more comprehensive secondary evaluation. Address all emergent life threats in a stepwise manner during the primary survey before progressing to the next stage. INTRODUCTION Trauma is currently the fourth leading cause of death in the United States across all age groups and the leading cause of death in patients under the age of 44 years. It is responsible for more deaths in patients under the age of 19 years than all other causes combined. Approximately 40% of all emergency department (ED) visits are for trauma-related complaints, and the annual costs exceed $400 billion. Adding to these costs, permanent disability is actually 3 times more likely than death in this cohort. Trauma is broadly classified by mechanism into blunt and penetrating varieties, with the former more than twice as common as the latter. Regardless of mechanism, victims of significant trauma present with a wide range of complex problems, and their proper care necessitates a multidisciplinary approach, including emergency physicians, trawna surgeons, and the appropriate subspecialties. Most trawna care delivery systems follow the Advanced Trawna Life Support guidelines developed and maintained by the American College of Surgeons. The mortality rates for trawnatic injuries typically follow a trimodal distribution. Certain injury patterns including major vascular injuries and high cervical cord disruption with secondary apnea result in near immediate death. The second cohort of injuries, including conditions Treat hemodynamically unstable patients as hemor\u00ad rhagic shock until proven otherwise. Initiate aggressive volume resuscitation in all unstable patients while concurrently searching for active sources of hemorrhage. such as pnewnothorax and pericardia! tamponade, typically evolve over a duration of minutes to hours and are generally responsive to aggressive emergent intervention. Septicemia and multisystem organ failure account for the third peak of fatalities and typically occur weeks to months after injury. CLINICAL PRESENTATION History Attempt to identify the severity of mechanism, as this will predict the patterns of injury. For example, determine the approximate speed of a motor vehicle collision (MVC) and whether or not the patient was restrained. Emergency medical service personnel can be an invaluable resource, especially in amnestic and nonverbal patients. In assault patients, inquire if they can recall exactly what they were struck with and the nwnber of times. Ask if there was any loss of consciousness, as this may portend to a significant head injury. For penetrating trawna, ask about the number of shots heard and how many times the patient felt himself or herself get shot. Obtain a brief medical history using the AMPLE mnemonic. Ask about any known drug allergies, current medication use, past medical history, last oral intake, and the immediate events leading up to the injury. Keep in 358 TRAUMA PRINCIPLES mind that regardless of past history, elderly patients have less physiologic reserve and are prone to higher rates of morbidity and mortality. In females of childbearing age, always ask about the last menstrual period and assume that they are pregnant until proven otherwise. Pregnant patients are at higher risk for domestic violence and warrant unique considerations such as placental abruption, uterine rupture, the supine hypotensive syndrome, and fetal distress or demise. Even apparently minor injuries including falls and low-speed motor vehicle accidents can induce preterm labor or placental abruption. Always ask about any evolving symptoms and identify the exact locations of pain, as this will guide your physical exam. Patients with altered mental status should be treated as having a traumatic brain injury until proven otherwise. Shortness of breath may indicate an underlying pneumothorax (PTX), pulmonary contusion, or pericardia! tamponade. Chest pain may indicate an underlying fracture of the ribs or sternum, hemothorax (HTX), or traumatic aortic injury (TAl). Assume that patients with abdominal pain, hematemesis, or rectal bleeding have an intra-abdominal visceral injury until proven otherwise. Patients complain\u00ad ing of hematuria should be considered at a high risk for injury to the genitourinary (GU) tract. Neurologic com\u00ad plaints including weakness and paresthesias may indicate an underlying spinal cord injury or vascular dissection. Physical Examination The physical exam in major trauma patients is very systematic and can be divided into primary and secondary surveys. Primary Survey The primary survey is a very brief and focused exam meant to identify and address emergent life threats. It should pro\u00ad ceed in a stepwise approach outlined by the ABCDE mne\u00ad monic. Always treat any encountered abnormalities before proceeding to the next step in the survey. If a patient decom\u00ad pensates at any point during his or her clinical course, return to the beginning of the primary survey and reassess. Assume an unstable cervical spine injury in all major trauma victims until proven otherwise and immediately immobilize on presentation. Assess the airway for patency. Signs of potential airway compromise include pooling pharyngeal secretions, intraoral foreign bodies, midface, mandibular, laryngeal fractures, and expanding neck hematomas. Evaluate the patient's breathing and ventilation. Expose the chest and look for any signs of asymmetrical or paradoxical chest wall movement, obvious deformities or open wounds, tracheal deviation, and jugular venous distention. Auscultate the chest to confirm strong symmetric bilateral breath sounds. The goal is to identify the presence of emergent life threats including tension PTX, massive HTX, open PTX (sucking chest wound), and flail chest. Rapidly assess the patient's circulation by evaluating for signs of altered mental status. A depressed level of consciousness should be considered hypovolemic shock until proven otherwise. Other findings concerning for hem\u00ad orrhagic shock include pale, cool, and mottled extremities and thready peripheral pulses. Auscultate the heart to detect distant heart tones suggestive of an underlying pericardia! effusion. Identify all sources of active bleeding and control with the application of direct pressure. Perform a rapid neurologic exam, noting any evidence of disability or deficits. Document the patient's level of consciousness; note the size, symmetry , and reactivity of the pupils; and assess for any focal numbness or weakness. Perform a rectal exam to ensure adequate rectal tone and determine the patient's Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). Completely expose the patient to ensure that all potential life threats have been accounted for. Carefully log-roll the patient to examine the back and rule out any occult penetrating injuries. Once complete, immedia tely cover the patient with warm blankets to prevent the development of hypothermia. Secondary Survey The secondary survey is a complete head-to-toe examination that should be performed once the patient has been stabi\u00ad lized. Examine the scalp, noting any lacerations, contusions, and deformities. Check the visual acuity, visual fields, extra\u00ad ocular movements, and pupil size and reactivity. Assess the globe for penetrating injuries, lacerations, or proptosis. Examine the mid-face, looking for evidence of fracture, lacerations, epistaxis, or septal hematomas. Look for signs of basilar skull fracture such as hemotympanum, perior\u00ad bital (raccoon eyes) or retroauricular ecchymoses fluid (CSF) rhinorrhea or otor\u00ad rhea. CSF rhinorrhea can be detected with the use of a bedside \"halo-test.\" Check for dental injuries or evidence of mandibular fracture, including point tenderness, malocclu\u00ad sion, and sublingual hematomas. Inspect the neck, noting any signs of obvious tracheal deviation, laryngeal fracture, subcutaneous emphysema, or expanding hematoma. Carefully palpate the cervical spine to detect any point tenderness or bony step-offs. Re-inspect the chest, noting any signs of contusions, asymmetry , paradoxical movement, or penetrating injury. Palpate the ribs and sternum, checking for point tenderness, soft tissue crepitus, and bony deformity. Repeat auscultation of the lungs and heart and document any abnormalities. Inspect the abdomen for any signs of distention, contusions, or penetrating injury. Palpate all 4 quadrants to elicit any tenderness, guarding, or rebound. Carefully assess the pelvis for signs of an unstable fracture by gently compressing the iliac crests. Inspect the perineum for lacerations, contusions, and hematomas. Perform vaginal and rectal examinations to assess for gross blood or mucosal trauma. Note the rectal tone and check the prostate for signs of displacement. Findings CHAPTER 84 consistent with urethral injury include scrotal hematomas, blood at the urethral meatus, and a high-riding prostate. Look for any signs of blunt or penetrating trauma to the extremities. Document any open wounds, point tenderness, or obvious deformities. Range all joints, looking for abnormal movement. Palpate all muscle compartments to detect any signs of developing tension. Roll the patient and palpate the entire spine, noting any point tenderness or bony step-offs. Assess the pulses in all 4 extremities. In penetrating trauma, the \"hard\" signs of arterial injury include absent distal pulses, pulsatile bleeding, expanding hematomas, and the presence of bruits or thrills. The \"soft\" signs of arterial injury include diminished distal pulses, visible hematomas, corresponding peripheral nerve deficits, or delayed capillary refill. Patients with soft signs for arterial injury require the measurement of the arterial pressure index (API). The API can be calculated by dividing the systolic pressure of the affected extremity by the systolic pressure of the contralateral unaffected limb. An API <0.9 is considered abnormal and suggestive of arterial injury. Finally, perform a comprehensi ve motor and sensory examination, reevaluate the pupils and mental status, and recalculate the GCS. DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES Laboratory Check a STAT bedside capillary blood glucose level in all patients with an abnormal mental status as hypoglycemia can mimic a traumatic brain injury. Check a complete blood count to assess an initial hematocrit and follow serially to assess for occult hemorrhage and responsi veness to therapy. If available, obtain a bedside serum base deficit and lactate level and follow serially to gauge responsiveness to therapy. Send a type and screen on all trauma patients and crossmatch blood as necessary for patients likely to require transfusi ons or operative intervention. Obtain a urinalysis to rule out gross hematuria, a bedside urine pregnancy test in all female patients of childbearing age, and a urine toxicology screen in patients with an abnormal level of consciousness. Check coagulation studies in all patients with a clotting disorder (eg, patients on warfarin). Imaging Portable plain radiography is readily available at most institutions for the rapid bedside evaluation of trauma patients. Plain films are useful for diagnosing bony fractures including unstable pelvic and spinal injuries; determining the trajectory of penetrating projectiles; identifying HTX, PTX, or an abnormal mediastinum; and detecting the presence of intraperitoneal free air. Bedside ultrasonography provides a quick, highly sensitive, noninvasive, and readily repeatable modality to detect occult hemorrhage. Perform a FAST exam to look for signs of peri\u00ad cardia! tamponade, PTX/HTX, and intraperitoneal bleeding further details). Computed tomography ( CT) imaging has revolutionized the care of trauma patients. That said, this modality does expose the patient to increased health care costs, potential contrast reactions, and harmful ionizing radiation, so every effort should be made to limit its use to patients whose con\u00ad dition truly warrants it. Furthermore, CT imaging should be pursued only in patients who are stable enough to safely leave the resuscitation area for an extended period of time. CT imaging of the head has become invaluable for the evaluation and treatment of patients with traumatic brain injury. CT imaging of the chest is now the preferred modal\u00ad ity to evaluate patients with potential intrathoracic vascular emergencies ( eg, TAl) and evolving pulmonary contusions. CT of the abdomen and pelvis can simultaneously detect solid viscus injury (eg, liver and spleen) and intraperitoneal hemorrhage and determine the severity of pelvic injuries. Finally, CT angiography has rapidly become the preferred means to exclude vascular injuries in patients whose condi\u00ad tion warrants some form of radiographic imaging (eg, patients with \"soft signs\" for arterial injury). Magnetic resonance imaging is useful for the evaluation of patients with potential spinal cord injury and to further delineate the severity of traumatic brain injury. That said, its use should be limited only to stable patients who can afford prolonged excursions outside of a resuscitation arena. PROCEDU RES The coordinated resuscitation of a critically ill trauma patient may require a multitude of simultaneous interventions. The following procedures are described in detail in the corre\u00ad sponding chapters: central line placement and volume resuscitation (Chapter 3), needle thoracostomy and chest tube insertion (Chapter 7), emergent airway manage\u00ad ment (Chapter 11), pericardiocentesis and ED thoracotomy (Chapter 8 7), and diagnostic peritoneal lavage (Chapter 88). Perform a retrograde urethrogram and cystogram in all patients with suspected urethral and bladder injuries. Indications include straddle injuries, pelvic fractures, scrotal hematomas, high-riding prostates, and blood at the urethral meatus. A urethrogram is performed by injecting intravenous (IV) dye into the urethral meatus while simultaneously capturing a pelvic radiograph to detect any signs of urethral disruption (ie, contrast extravasat ion). Avoid the insertion of a Foley catheter into any patient with a demonstrated urethral injury without GU consultation. For patients with an intact urethra, insert a catheter and distend the bladder with up to 300 mL of diluted IV con\u00ad trast while simultaneously capturing a pelvic radiograph (cystogram) to detect any evidence of bladder rupture. MEDICAL DECISION MAKING Obtain a complete set of vital signs and note any abnormalit ies. Hemodynamic instability in the setting of trauma is hemorrhagic shock until proven otherwise. Initiate aggressive volume resuscitation in said patients. TRAUMA PRINCIPLES Primary survey Identify and treat emergent life threats Discharge home Admit for observation and serial testing Operative intervention Figure 84-1. Trauma principles diagnostic algorithm. OR, operating room. Perform an immediate primary survey and address any emergent life threats including airway obstruction, tension or open PTX, massive HTX, and pericardia! tamponade. Use your laboratory and imaging studies as necessary to determine the presence and severity of injury. Following patient stabilization, perform a comprehensive secondary survey and treat all encountered injuries (Figure 84-1). ..... Treatment Evaluation and treatment should coincide during the primary survey. All life-threatening conditions must be stabilized before further evaluation. Secure the airway in any patient with signs of impending compromise. Patients with a GCS 8 require endotracheal intubation to guard against obstruction and/or aspiration. Examine the thoracic wall to identify any open PTX and cover with a 3-sided occlusive dressing to restore normal respi\u00ad ratory mechanics. Perform immediate needle thoracos\u00ad to my in all patients with signs of tension PTX, and place a chest tube in all patients with evidence of traumatic PTXorHTX. Patients with evidence of impaired circulation require large-bore IV access and aggressive volume resuscitation (Lactated Ringer's or normal saline).

Tataris, MD Key Points Traumatic brain injury can be classified by severity into mild (Glasgow coma Scale [GCS] <::14), moderate (GCS 9-13), and severe (GCS::::: 8) categories. emergent noninfused head computed tomography is the imaging modality of choice in patients with cranial trauma. INTRODUCTION Between 1.2 and 2 million patients sustain some form of traumatic brain injury (TBI) in the United States every year. Fortunately the majority of cases ( -80%) are mild, as moderate and severe TBI is associated with significa nt long-term disability and death. In fact, head injuries are the leading cause of traumatic death in all patients younger than 25 years. Currently more than 50,000 deaths and 370,000 hospitalizations are attributable to TBI on an annual basis. The associated costs of caring for patients with acute and chronic TBI are astronomical, exceeding $4 billion per year. TBI occurs as the normal physiologic function of the brain is disrupted by either direct (object striking the cranium ) or indirect (accelera\u00ad tion/decelerat ion) forces. Patterns of injury can be classi\u00ad fied as either primary (occur at the time of impact) or secondary (develop over time owing to neurochemical and inflammatory responses ). Patients with TBI can be further stratified by their Glasgow Coma Scores (GCS) into mild (GCS ;:::14), moderate (GCS 9-13), and severe (GCS 8) categories (Table 85-1). Cerebral circulation is dictated by the cerebral perfu\u00ad sion pressure (CPP), and ensuring adequate blood flow is of the utmost importance in patients with TBI. The CPP is proportional to the difference between the mean arterial pressure (MAP and the intracranial pressure (ICP) (CPP oc Patients with intracranial hemorrhage can quickly dete\u00ad riorate and require frequent neurological re-evaluations. Limit secondary brain injury by identifying and address\u00ad ing concurrent hypoxemia, hypotension, and increased intracranial pressure. MAP-ICP). The intracranial space is a fixed volume, and the ICP is determined by the amount of brain tissue, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) within it. Increases in Table 85-1. Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS).

The brain can autoregulate cerebral perfusion under normal physiologic conditions, but cannot do so at the extremes of either MAP or ICP. Therefore, processes that significantly decrease the MAP ( eg, traumatic shock) or increase the ICP (eg, intracranial hemorrhage) may impair cerebral perfusion and exacerbate secondary brain injury. The following is a list of specific injury patterns seen in patients with TBI: Concussions represent a traumatic alteration in neurologic function in the absence of abnormalities on computed tomography (CT) imaging. Symptoms including recurring headaches, sleep disturbances, and difficulties with concentration that can persist for months (postconcussive syndrom e). Skull fractures can be categorized by location (basilar vs calvarium), pattern (linear, depressed, or comminuted ), and by whether they are open or closed injuries. Cerebral contusions represent punctate intraparenchy\u00ad mal hemorrhages with surrounding edema and occur most commonl y in the frontal, temporal, and occipital lobes. Contusions that occur both at the direct site of injury and the opposing side of the brain secondary to indirect deceleration forces are known as coup and contrecoup injuries, respectively. Traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is the most common abnormality recognized on posttrau\u00ad matic CT imaging. Traumatic SAH occurs when injury to the small subarachnoid vessels leads to secondary hemorrhage within the subarachnoid space. Subdural hematoma (SDH) is most common ly encountered in patients with significant cerebral at\u00ad rophy (elderly, alcoholics). They occur when excessive shearing forces injure the small bridging veins in the subdural space. SDHs classically appear on CT imag\u00ad ing as crescent-shaped hematomas that freely cross suture lines. As a distinct history of trauma may not be present, always maintain a high index of suspicion in elderly patients with nonspecific mental status changes. Epidural hematoma (EDH) is most commonly seen in patients with temporoparietal skull fractures and second\u00ad ary injury to the middle meningeal artery. They occur when high-pressure arterial bleeding separates the dura from the inner table of the skull to form a hematoma. EDHs are classically lentiform or bean-shaped in appear\u00ad imaging do not cross the cranial suture lines (Figure 85-1). The classic presentation is a patient with blunt head trauma who initially appears well after the injury (the so-called lucid interval) only to rapidly decompensate several hours later. Diffuse axonal injury (DAI) occurs when sudden decel\u00ad eration mechanisms transmit shearing forces diffusely Figure 85-1. CT scan of the head showing an epidural (patient's left) and a subdural (patient's right) hematoma. across the axonal fibers of the brain. CT imaging is nonspecific, and patients tend to have poor outcomes. Penetrating brain injury is usually catastrophic be\u00ad cause of the immense amount of kinetic energy trans\u00ad mitted to very sensitive brain tissues. Mortality rates from gunshot wounds to the head approach 90%. In addition to the specific injury patterns listed previ \u00ad ously, TBI can lead to drastic increases in in herniation. Transtentorial herniation of the temporal lobe uncus is the most common form and typically presents with altered mental status and a dilated or blown pupil secondary to compression of the oculomotor nerve ( cra\u00ad nial tonsils through the foramen magnum can occur with significant in the ICP, especially with poste\u00ad rior fossa hemorrhages, and is rapidly fatal due to com\u00ad pression and consequent dysfunction of the brainstem. CLINICAL PRESENTATION History Always attempt to identify the exact mechanism of injury, as this may predict the severity of damage to the central nervous system (CNS). For example, clarify the height of a fall, the speed of a motor vehicle collision (MVC), or the use of seatbelt restraints or airbag deployment. Emergency medical service personal can be invaluable in this setting. Inquire about any loss of consciousness, as this may portend more significant injury. The antecedent use of alcohol or illicit drugs may complicate the neurologic assessment, and their influence should be documented. Ask about the use of any prescription or over-the-counter medications, as anticoagulants can induce life-threatening bleeding despite only minor injury. Finally, look for any signs and symptoms suggestive of increased ICP (altered mental status, vomiting, headache), as this will require emergent neurosurgical intervention. ..... Physical Examination As with all trauma patients, begin with a rapid primary survey, and aggressively address any emergent life threats. Carefully note vital signs, as they can predict the likelihood of secondary brain injury. Cushing reflex, defined as pro\u00ad gressive hypertension, bradycardia, and a decreased respi\u00ad ratory rate, is frequently indicative of a potentially life-threatening increase in ICP. A gross inspection of the scalp may reveal gaping lac\u00ad erations or obvious cranial deformities. Carefully inspect all deep lacerations for violation of the galea, as disrup\u00ad tion of this tough layer of connective tissue man dates careful primary closure. Palpate the skull to detect step\u00ad off deformities indicative of underlying fracture. Examine the eyes and the ears for any signs of injury. Battle sign (retroauricular ecchymosis), raccoon eyes (periorbital ecchymo sis), hemotympanum, and CSF rhinorrhea or otorrhea are all signs of an underlying basilar skull frac\u00ad ture (Figure 85-2). Carefully palpate the cervical spine and always assume an occult C-spine injury until proven otherwise. Perform a comprehensi ve neurologic exam to identify any findings suggestive of significa nt injury. Examine the pupils, taking care to note size, symmetry , and reactivity. A dilated unresponsive pupil in the setting of cranial trauma indicates transtentorial herniation until proven otherwise. Document an initial GCS and repeat fre\u00ad quently to detect flexion (decorticate) or extension extremities on painful stimulation indi\u00ad cates severe intracrania l injury with possible 85-2. \"Raccoon eyes\" suggestive of a basilar skull fracture. HEAD INJURIES DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES ..... Laboratory A routine trauma panel including a complete blood count, chemistry, coagulation studies, and toxicology screening should be ordered on all patients with significant multisys \u00ad tern trauma. That said, there are no laboratory studies specific for the diagnosis or management of TBI. .....Imaging An emergent noninfused head CT is the study of choice for the evaluation of patients with potential TBI. It is quick, noninvasive, and highly sensitive for the diagnosis of both bony and intracranial injuries. Patients who present more than 48 hours after injury may require intravenous (IV) contrast to delineate the presence of isodense subdural hematomas. CT imaging does expose patients to poten\u00ad tially harmful ionizing radiation, and the patient's clinical presentation should always guide the decision to image. Indications for CT imaging in adult patients are debat\u00ad able, but most agree that any of the following findings war\u00ad ranttesting: GCS <15, age >65 years,high-energy mechanisms (fall >3ft) focal neurologic deficits, 2 episodes of vomiting, evidence of depressed or basilar skull fracture, posttraumatic seizure, persistent anterograde amnesia, persistent severe headache, or the presence of coagulopathies. The indications for CT imaging in pediatric patients are similarly debatable but typically include the presence of any of the following: loss of consciousness, abnormal mental status, vomiting, palpable skull fracture or signs of basilar skull fracture, scalp hemato - mas, and high-energy mechanisms. PROCEDURES Severe TBI patients with subdural or epidural hematomas and evidence of impending or evolving herniation require intracranial decompression and clot evacuation via emer\u00ad gent burr-hole placement performed by a neurosurgeon or emergency physician. MEDICAL DECISION MAKING The primary survey and presenting GCS should guide the work-up and management of patients with TBI. The differential diagnosis should include all of the aforemen\u00ad tioned conditions, including cerebral contusions, intracra\u00ad nial hemorrhage, and DAl. Rapidly decompensa ting patients should be considered evolving herniations until proven otherwise. Emergent CT imaging will help establish the proper diagnosis and guide further treatmen t (Figure 85-3). TREATMENT The management of TBI begins with the primary survey. Patients with severe TBI (GCS :s;8) require emergent endo\u00ad tracheal intubation to maintain airway protection. Perform GCS 15, minor mechanism, age < 60, no anticoagulant use, AND no neurologic deficit, vomiting, intoxication, headache , or seizure activity DC home with competent caregiver CHAPTER 85 repeat exam repeat exam Figure 85-3. Head injuries diagnostic algorithm. CT, computed tomography; care unit; TBI, traumatic brain injury. rapid sequence intubation while following head trauma precautions (see Chapter 11). Systemic hypotension can significantly impair adequate cerebral perfusion, and patients require aggressive volume resuscitation to maintain a MAP >90 mmHg and suitable CPP. Address any uncon\u00ad trolled scalp hemorrhage, as blood loss can be significant. Patients with evidence of increased ICP and impending herniation require immediate medical intervention pending definitive neurosurgical care. Mild hyperventilation to a goal PaC02 between 30 and 35 mmHg can temporarily reduce the ICP by decreasin g cerebral blood flow. Hyperosmotic agents such as IV mannitol (0.25-2 g/kg) can reduce intracerebral edema and thereby decrease the ICP. Elevating the head of the bed to 30 degrees can reduce the ICP by simple gravity. All of these interventions should be considered temporizing measures while awaiting operative decompression or bedside extraventricular drain placement. Posttraumatic seizures can be devastating, as they sig\u00ad nificantly exacerbate secondary brain injury. Antiepileptic drug loading (eg, phenytoin 18 mg/kg) should be pursued in all patients without known contraindications. Treat patients who are actively seizing with aggressive doses of IV benzodiazepines (eg, lorazepam 0.05 mg/kg) until their convulsions are controlled. Patients with traumatic SAH are at an elevated risk of ischemic complications secondary to cerebral vasospasm. The careful use of peripheral arteriolar vasodilators ( eg, nimodipine 60 mg orally) may limit this phenomenon in hemodynamically stable patients, although recent data suggests minimal utility at best. Finally, patients with fractures that either involve a maxillofacial sinus or are open to the environment warrant antibiotic prophylaxis to limit secondary infection and tetanus vaccination. Those with skull fractures whose margins are depressed beyond the inner table of the adjacent skull warrant neurosurgical consultation for operative elevation. DISPOSITION ..... Admission Admit all patients with severe TBI ( GCS :=;s) or docu\u00ad mented injury on CT imaging to an intensive care unit setting with neurosurgical consultation, as they will require continuous ICP monitoring. Patients with a persistent GCS <15, evidence of basilar skull fracture, open or depressed fractures, and those with linear fractures that cross an arterial groove or dural sinus require admission for observation and serial neurologic exams. ..... Discharge Low-risk patients with a normal GCS and neurologic exam can be safely discharged from the ED. If a CT scan was not indicated at the time of the initial visit, discharge the patient with instructions to return for any changes in men\u00ad tal status, vomiting, or worsening headaches. Ideally, a responsible adult will be present to monitor the patient at home over the next 24 hours. If a CT scan is performed HEAD INJURIES and is negative, it is unlikely the patient will require any neurosurgical intervention in the future. These patients can also be discharged assuming normal GCS and neuro\u00ad logic exam. They should receive similar head injury pre\u00ad cautions. Patients diagnosed with a concussion should avoid any contact sports until all symptoms have completely resolved and they have been cleared by a trained physician. Postconcussive syndromes including headaches and prob\u00ad lems concentrating or sleeping are fairly common and may persist for several weeks to months after the injury.

Forego plain films and pr oceed directly to computed to\u00ad mography imaging of the cervical spine for all patients with a moderate to high risk of injury. INTRODUCTION There are currently more than 200,000 patients living with spinal cord injury (SCI) in the United States, and between 12,000 and 20,000 new cases occur on an annual basis. The majority of patients are between 16 and 30 years of age, with motor vehicle collisions, falls, violence, and sporting injuries accounting for the bulk of cases. Fewer than 1% of patients experience complete neurologic recovery before hospital discharge, and the associated economical, physical, and emotional tolls are astronomical. The cervical spine is composed of 7 cervical vertebrae, the first 2 of which are unique, whereas the remaining 5 (C3 through C7) are functionally similar. The anatomy of the axis (C1) is that of a bony ring without a true vertebral body. It consists of an anterior and posterior arch joined together by 2 lateral masses that articulate with the occipital condyles above and C2 below. The Atlas ( C2) has a unique anterior body that extends superiorly to form the odontoid process. This structure articulates with the internal surface of the anterior ring of C1 and is held in place by the transverse ligament. The unique design of these 2 vertebrae allow for the increased flexibility and axial rotation of the upper cervical spine. The remaining cervical vertebrae are functionally similar and composed of an anterior body and a posterior arch. Consider spinal cord injury without radiologic abnormal\u00ad ity in pediatric patients with neurologic findings despite negative initial imaging. The use of high-dose corticosteroids to improve long\u00ad term neurologic outcomes in patients with blunt spinal cord injury is no longer recommended. The vertebrae are separated by flexible intervertebral disks and linked together by an intricate system of ligaments that allows the spine to function as a single unit. Anterior and posterior longitudinal ligaments run along the entire length of the vertebral bodies, whereas the posterior rings are linked together by the ligamentum flavum and interspinous ligaments (Figure 86-1). This network enables significant spinal column mobility while still providing adequate spinal cord protection as it courses within the spinal canal between the body and arch of each vertebra. External forces that exceed the normal physiologic range of motion can result in fractures, dislocations, and spinal cord injuries. Children and the elderly are especially prone to injury of the upper cervical spine ( C1 through C3 ), whereas young and middle-aged adults are more likely to injure the lower cervical spine (C6 through Tl). Of the cervical vertebrae, the atlas (C2) is the most frequently fractured. Delineating between stable and unstable injury is of supreme clinical importance. The Denis 3-colurnn theory is very helpful in this regard and divides the spine into 3 functional units. The anterior column is composed of the anterior portions of the vertebral body and annulus fibrosis together with the anterior longitudinal ligament. The middle column includes the posterior vertebral body, the posterior annulus \u00ad nal ligament. The posterior column is composed of the 368 CERVICAL SPINE INJURIES interspinous ligament posterior longit.udinal ligament Figure 86-1. Bony and ligamentous anatomy of the spine. Reprinted Tintinalli JE, Kelen GD, Stapczynski JS. Tintinolli's Emergency ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, 2004. posterior vertebral arch and the the ligamentum flavum and the interspinous and supraspinous ligaments. Injuries to 2 of the columns are considered functionally unstable. In addition, acute compression fractures involving >25% of the height of the vertebral bodies of C3-C7 are considered clinically unstable. Cervical spine fractures can be further classified by their mechanism of injury (Table 86-1). Flexion injuries compress the anterior column and distract the posterior column, resulting in anterior body fractures and disruption of the posterior ligamentous complex. Specific examples include anterior subluxations, bilateral facet dislocations, simple wedge fractures, spinous process avulsions (clay shoveler's fracture), and flexion teardrop fractures. A con\u00ad current rotational mechanism results in unilateral facet dislocatio ns. Simple wedge fractures, spinous process avulsions, and unilateral facet dislocations are generally considered stable, whereas the remainder represent unstable injuries. Extension injuries compress the posterior column and distract the anterior column, resulting in crush injuries to the posterior elements and disruption of the anterior longitudinal ligament. Specific examples include extension teardrop fractures, hangman's fractures (traumatic spondylolisthesis of C2), laminar fractures, and hyperextension dislocatio ns. With the exception of simple laminar fractures, these injuries are generally unstable. Axial load injuries occur when vertical compression forces shatter the ring-like structure of a cervical vertebra, resulting in an outward burst of bony fragments. These injuries require disruption of all 3 columns and are clinically unstable. Burst fractures of Cl (Jefferson frac\u00ad ture) are relatively common and highly unstable. Table 86-1.

Emer gency Study Guide. 7th ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, 2011. Any significant trauma to the spinal cord generally occurs at the time of the initial injury. Although individual injuries will frequently exhibit unique neurologic findings, several classic syndromes have been described. The central cord syndrome occurs with hyperextension mechanisms, typically in elderly patients with severe spinal stenosis. It presents with motor weakness that is more pronounced in the upper extremities as compared with the lower. The anterior cord syndrome occurs with hyperflexion mecha\u00ad nisms and results in motor and sensory loss below the level of injury with preservation of position and vibratory sense (located in the posterior columns ). The Brown-Sequard syndrome most commonly stems from a penetrating injury that hemisects the cord. Classic findings include the ipsilateral loss of motor function and position and CHAPTER 86 vibratory sensation combined with the contralateral loss of pain and temperature sensation distal to the lesion. Spinal cord injury without radiologic abnormality (SCIWORA) is seen in pediatric patients and should be considered in all patients with neurologic findings despite negative initial plain film or computed tomography (CT) imaging. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may reveal significant pathology, including ligamentous injury, intra\u00ad cordal edema, and hemorrhage. CLINICAL PRESENTATION History Try to determine the exact mechanism of injury, as this may help predict the overall severity of pathology (Table 86-2). Inquire about the presence of neck pain and any neurologic complaints, including weakness, paresthesias, and the loss of bowel or bladder function. Review the patient's past medical history for relevant comorbid conditions, includ\u00ad ing rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, or cervical degenerative joint disease. Table 86-2.

Tintina/lis Emergency Medicine: A Comprehensive Study Guide. 7th ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, 2011. Physical Examination As with all trauma patients, perform an initial primary survey and address all emergent life-threatening conditions. Immobilize all patients with any suspicion for cervical spine injury by applying a hard cervical collar. Visually inspect the spine for any signs of trauma, including abrasions, ecchymoses, open wounds, and deformity, and carefully palpate for any focal tenderness or bony step\u00ad offs. Keep in mind that the presence of alterations in men\u00ad tal status (eg, intoxication of head injury) or distracting injuries ( eg, significant extremity fractures) may render the physical exam unreliable. Perform a thorough neurologic exam, including an assessment of strength, sensation (including light touch and proprioception ), deep tendon reflexes, and rectal tone. The bulbocavernosus reflex can be used to differentiate between complete and incomplete SCI. With a gloved finger in the rectum, gently squeeze the glans penis or the clitoris with your opposite hand. The involuntary contraction of the anal sphincter indicates a positive reflex and rules out a complete SCI. DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES Laboratory There are no laboratory tests specific for the diagnosis and management of cervical spine injury. Imaging A standard 3-view series of the cervical spine (anteroposterior [AP], lateral, and odontoid views) has been the historical standard to rule out cervical spine injury. Recent evidence has questioned the sensitivity of these films, and most patients with a moderate to high likelihood of cervical spine injury warrant noninfused CT imaging (sensitivity for bony injury >95%). Plain films are generally adequate for pediatric patients and young otherwise healthy adults with a very low pretest probability for injury. The entire cervical spine extending from the occiput to the top of Tl must be visualized to consider the imaging adequate when reviewing plain films (Table 86-3 and Figures 86-2 through 86-7). MRI is the study of choice in all patients with neurological deficits and those with presumed unstable ligamentous injuries. Table 86-3. Key to interpretation of cervical spine radiographs.

MEDICAL DECISION MAKING Immediately immobilize all patients at risk for cervical spine injury, perform a primary and secondary survey, and address any emergent life threats. All patients with potential cervical spine injury require some form of C-spine clear\u00ad ance. The NEXUS criteria and Canadian C-spine rules can be used to identify patients at a low risk of significant injury who can be clinically cleared without the need for radio\u00ad graphic studies (Tables 86-4 and 86-5). Patients who do not meet either criterion require radiographic clearance. Posterior laminal ---- .. \\ line Predental space: < 3 mm in adult < 5 mm in child Figure 86-4.

All patients with abnormal imag\u00ad ing and/or neurologica l deficits require neurosurgica l consultation. Transfer such patients to a higher level of care if necessary (Figure 86-8). TREATMENT All patients with suspected cervical spine injury require immediate immobilization on presentation. The collar can be temporarily removed to facilitate endotracheal intubation as necessary provided an additional health care provider can maintain appropriate in-line stabilizati on. If available, some of the newer fiber-optic devices permit endotracheal intuba\u00ad tion with little to no movement of the cervical spine. Patients who are either clinically or radiographically cleared can be managed with oral analgesics. Those who require par\u00ad enteral pain control should have their diagnosis reconsidered. The use of steroids in SCI remains highly controversial. The recent Consortium for Spinal Cord Medicine (2008) concluded that there is no current evidence to definitely recommend the use of steroids in the standard manage\u00ad ment of patients with blunt spinal cord injury. Furthermore, the most current American Association of Neurological Surgeons guidelines (2013) state that the use of steroids for acute spinal cord injury is not recommended and there is CERVICAL SPINE INJURIES Potential cervical spine injury Immobilize patient, primary and secondary survey NEXUS/Canadian C-spine criteria met NEXUS/Canadian c -spine criteria not met Radiographs C-spine Normal radiographs with adequate visualization, no persistent pain Abnormal or inadequate radiographs, new neuro deficit, persistent pain Figure 86-8.

Schindlbeck, MD Key Points Thoracic trauma is the second leading cause of traumatic death in the United States. All patients require a rapid primary survey focused on patient airway, breathing, and circulation and stabiliza\u00ad tion of any emergent life-threatening conditions. INTRODUCTION Thoracic trauma accounts for more than 16,000 deaths in the United States annually and constitutes approximately 25% of all trauma related mortality. For clinical purposes, patients can be divided into blunt and penetrating catego\u00ad ries based on the mechani sm of injury. Approximately 80% of cases of significant blunt thoracic trauma are secondary to motor vehicle collisions (MVC), whereas most cases of penetrating trauma in the United States are due to stab wounds and low-velocity handgun injuries. Blunt Thoracic Injuries Injuries that occur after blunt thoracic trauma include frac\u00ad tures (sternum/ri bs), flail chest, pulmonary contusion, myo\u00ad cardial injury, and aortic injury. Although fractures to the sternum and ribs are usually not life-threatening, displaced and/or multiple rib fractures are an exception. Evaluate for injury to underlying structures-the mediastinum and great vessels with ribs 1-3, the lungs with ribs 4-8, and the liver or spleen with ribs 9-12. Flail chest occurs when 3 contiguous ribs are fractured in places, thereby creating a \"free float\u00ad ing\" segment of the chest wall. Pulmonary contusions are focal regions of bruised lung parenchyma resulting in alveolar hemorrhage and edema, which can significantly impair normal respiratory function. Emergent life threats in thoracic trauma include airway obstruction, tension pneumothorax, open pneumotho\u00ad rax, massive hemothor ax, and pericardia! tamponade. In select penetrating trauma victims who suffer wit\u00ad nessed loss of vital signs, emergent thoracotomy can be a lifesaving procedure. They typically develop over several hours post injury and are often missed on the initial patient assessment. Blunt myocardial injury (BMI) should be considered in any patient with significant direct trauma to the anterior chest wall. Myocardial contusions present as regions of \"stunned\" tissue that clinically behave analogous to myocardial infarc\u00ad tions. Rarely, patients with significant BMI may progress to outright cardiogenic shock due to impaired pump function or dysrhythmia. Blunt aortic injury (BAI) is seen in patients when a rapid decelerating force causes significant sheer strain and secondary rupture of the aorta. More than 80% of cases occur at the site of the ligamentum arteriosum just distal to the takeoff of the left subclavian artery. Roughly 20% of patients with BAI will survive to emergency department (ED) presentation because of the tamponading effects of an intact adventitia. As the presenting symptoms and clinical picture are highly variable, a high index of suspicion for BAI should be maintained for any patient with the appropriate mechanism of injury. Penetrating Thoracic Injuries Injuries common after penetrating thoracic trauma include pneumothorax, hemothorax, cardiac injury, pericardia! tamponade, great vessel injury, and tracheobronchial injury. Pneumothoraces (PTX) are rather common after penetrating 374 THORACIC TRAUMA thoracic trauma, but can also be seen in blunt injuries when a fractured rib lacerates the underlying pleura. A simple pneumothorax occurs when injured 1 ung tissue creates an air leak in the potential space between the visceral and parietal pleura. An open or communicating PTX occurs when a large open defect in the thoracic wall allows communication between the intrapleural space and the environment. Defects greater than two thirds of the diameter of the trachea will lead to severe respiratory impairment. A tension pneumothorax arises when an injury to the thoracic wall and/or underlying bronchopu lmonary structures allows the progressive accumulation of air into the intrapleural space. Rising intrathoracic pressure will eventually inhibit the venous return of circulating blood to the right atrium, resulting in cardiovascular collapse and ensuing pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. Tension PTX is a clinical diagnosis that requires immediate intervention. Hemothoraces (HTX) develop secondary to the accumulation of blood into the intrapleural space after injury to the lungs, heart, or thoracic vasculature. Each hemithorax can accommodate up to 40% of a patient's circulating blood volume. Massive HTX (accumulation > 1,500 mL) is an emergent life-threatening condition that can induce severe hypoxia and systemic hypotension. Penetrating cardiac injury (PCI) can be rapidly fatal. Occasionally patients, especially those with stab wounds to the anterior heart, will survive to ED presentation because of the tamponading effects of an intact pericardium. Accumulating fluid in the pericardia! space will eventually collapse the right side of the heart, resulting in cardiac arrest. Pericardia! tamponade is an emergent life threat requiring immediate intervention. Penetrating great vessel injury (PGVI) presents with massive HTXs with persistent high-volume bloody chest tube effluent. Suspect venous air embolism (VAE) in patients with penetrating vascular trauma, especially involving the subclavian vein, who suddenly decompensate into PEA arrest without alternative explanation. Tracheobronchial injury can be seen in both blunt and penetrating trauma and should be suspected in patients with an appropriate mechanism and either extensive subcutaneous emphysema or a persistent high-volume air leak after chest tube placement. CLINICAL PRESENTATION History A detailed history is usually deferred until the completion of the primary survey and stabilization of any evolving emergent life threats (Table 87-1). The severity of the mechanism should be estimated to determine the potential for underly\u00ad ing injury. Emergency medical service (EMS) personnel are an invaluable asset. Clues to significant injuries after an MVC include lack of seat-belt restraint, dashboard deformity, sig\u00ad nificant intrusion into the passenger compartment, pro\u00ad longed extraction, ejection from the vehicle, and on-the-scene Table 87-1. Emergent life threats in thoracic trauma. Airway Tension pneumothorax Pericardia! tamponade Open pneu mothorax Massive hemothorax death of other occupants. Sudden deceleration mechanisms, such as falls greater than 30 feet or an MVC greater than 30 mph, should raise concern for potential vascular shearing injuries. With penetrating trauma, the type of stabbing implement should be ascertained. Physical Examination An assessment of patient vital signs is the cornerstone of the primary survey. Progressive sinus tachycardia and sys\u00ad temic hypotension indicates a serious cardiovascular derangement that should be addressed immediately. Significant hypoxia could indicate an underlying pulmo\u00ad nary contusion, HTX, or PTX. Inspection of the venous indicative of pericardia! tamponade or tension PTX or tracheal deviation indicative of an evolving tension PTX. Examination of the thorax should begin with gross observation. Chest wall asymmetry with regional paradoxical movement during respiration indicates underlying flail chest. A large open defect in the chest wall with audible air movement during respiration indicates a communicating PT:x. Penetrating wounds either located within or transecting the \"cardiac box\" are most likely to involve the heart and surrounding mediastinal structures and require a more extensive work-up. The anterior cardiac box is defined as the region medial to the nipples extending between the suprasternal notch and xiphoid process. The posterior cardiac box is defined as the region between the medial borders of the scapulae extending from the superior border of the scapulae to the costal margin (Figure 87-1). Palpation of the chest wall can detect point tenderness indicative of an underlying fracture of the thoracic cage or soft tissue crepitus suggestive of an underlying PTX or tracheobronchial injury. Auscultation of the chest will reveal absent or diminished breath sounds indicative of an underlying PTX or HTX, whereas inspiratory crackles suggests an evolving pulmonary contusion. Diminished heart sounds are heard in patients with pericardia! bleeding and potential cardiac tamponade. Patients with significant thoracic trauma often have concomitant abdominal injuries. A careful examination of the upper abdomen should be performed in patients with fractures of the lower ribs due to the potential for contusion or laceration of the underlying liver or spleen. Finally, distal pulses should be assessed, as marked asymmetry could indicate significant vascular injury. CHAPTER 87 A B Figure 87-1. A, B. Anterior and posterior cardiac box. DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES ..... Laboratory There are no laboratory studies specific to the work-up of patients with thoracic trauma. Typical studies obtained include a complete blood count, electrolyte panel with renal function, serum and urine toxicology studies including an ethanol level, a serum lactate level, and a serum base deficit. These tests should be used primarily to determine the severity of the traumatic insult and the adequacy of the patient's physiologic response. .... Imaging All thoracic trauma patients, both blunt and penetrating, require an initial screening chest x-ray (CJCR). Sternal and rib fractures are often difficult to detect, with -50% missed on the initial CXR. This is especially true for frac\u00ad tures of the anterior and lateral portions of the first 5 ribs and sternal fractures when a lateral view is not obtained. Fortunat ely, it is the potential injury to any underlying structures that is of clinical significance. Pulmonary con\u00ad tusions will appear as focal opacifications within the lung parenchyma and typically manifest within the first 6 hours of presentation. A simple pneumotho rax will appear as free air within the intrapleural space with an adjacent visible edge of visceral pleura. A good rule of thumb is that a PTX of 2.5 em in an adult indicates a 40% loss of lung volume. Penetrating thoracic trauma patients with a normal initial CXR typically require repeat imag\u00ad ing several hours later to rule out the development of a delayed PTX. An HTX can be visualized on an upright CXR once -200 mL of blood has accumulated and will initially appear as blunting of the ipsilateral costophrenic angle (Figure 87-2). On a supine CXR, a large HTX will appear as a diffuse haziness of the entire hemithorax due to posterior layering of the free-flowing intrapleural blood. Finally, chest radiography can be used as a screen\u00ad ing study for BAl. Concerning findings include a widened superior mediastinum (>8 em), an indistinct or obscured aortic knob, rightward displacement of an intraesopha geal nasogastric tube, inferior displacement of the left , or an apical pleural cap (Figure 87-3). Because of a false-negative rate of -10%, a normal initial CXR cannot reliably exclude BAl. .&. Figure 87-2. Right-sided hemopneumo thorax. Note the absence of lung markings in the right hemithorax, radio-opaque collapsed lung tissue adjacent to the right hilum, blunting of the costophrenic angle due to blood in the intrapleural space, and air fluid level pathogno\u00ad monic for a hemopneumo thorax.

Note the widened superior mediastinum (arrows). A standard 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is the initial study of choice to work up patients with potential BMI. Because of its anterior location within the chest, the right ventricle is the most likely structure affected. Expected findings include ST-segment changes and/or T-wave inversions (typically in the inferior and anterior leads), conduction delays, and dysrhythrnias. A normal initial ECG in an asymptomatic individual reliably excludes any future complications of BMI. A bedside echocardiogram (ECHO) can be a useful adjunct in patients with presumed symptomatic BMI and may demonstrate focal regions of myocardial contusion that have the potential to progress to subsequent cardiogenic shock. Furthermore, ECHO is indicated in the work-up of any patient with penetrating trauma to the cardiac box, with aq ualifiedechocardiographer able to detect accumulations of blood as little as 20 mL within the pericardia! sac (Figure 87-4). Finally, bedside ultrasound (US) does have a role in helping to diagnose PTX and can detect HTX with a volume as low as 50 mL. Computed tomography angiogra phy ( CTA) has become the modality of choice in evaluating patients with potential BAI (Figure 87-5). Because of the high lethality associated with delayed diagnosis, any patient with a sudden decelera\u00ad tion mechanism (fall >30ft or MVC >30 mph) and either an abnormal CXR or evidence of thoracic injury should undergo CTA. Given improvements in CTA technolo gy, a normal study is essentially 100% sensitive to exclude BAl. PROCEDU RES ...... Needle and Tube Thoracostomy Needle decompression of a tension PTX is an emergently life-saving procedure and should be performed during the primary survey. Chest tube placement should be used for the management of nearly every traumatic PTX or HTX. See Chapter 7 for further details. A Figure 87-4.

Note the disrupted aortic lumen at the attachment site of the ligamentum arteriosum (arrow). ...... Pericardiocentesis Pericardiocentesis can be an emergent ly life-saving procedure for any patient exhibiting peri car dial tamponade. A long large-gauge needle (eg, a 10-cm 18-gauge spinal needle) should be inserted at the subxiphoid space and directed toward the underlying pericardium. US guidance CHAPTER 87 can facilitate proper placement. Aspiration of volumes as low as 10 mL of pericardia! blood result in stroke volume increases between 25% and 50% and can stabilize the patient pending definitive operative treatment . ...... ED Thoracotomy A resuscitative thoracotomy can be a life-saving procedure when performed on patients who lose signs of life either with EMS in route or in the ED. In the best possible cir\u00ad cumstances, survival rates are <10% and usually highest for victims of penetrating trauma, especially those with anterior stab wounds. Once the decision is made to per\u00ad form an ED thoracot omy, the procedure should be done expediently without delay. An incision should be made in the fourth or fifth intercostal space extending from the sternal border to the posterior axillary line. The intercostal muscles are incised and the ribs are retracted to expose the underlying thoracic viscera. The pericardium can be visu\u00ad alized by gently retracting the overlying lung, and any pericardia! blood will be apparent. The pericardium should be opened with a vertical incision (to avoid trauma to the nearby phrenic nerves) and the heart lifted forward and \"delivered\" from the pericardia! sac. Cardiac wounds are treated either with suture or staple closure (with care being made to avoid occluding an underlying coronary artery) or Foley catheter balloon tamponade. If the patient fails to respond, the descending aorta should be cross-clamped to direct any subsequent cardiac output into the cerebral and cardiopulmonary circulation. MEDICAL DECISION MAKING The management of the thoracic trauma patient should be algorithmic based on the mechanism and location of injury. Initial efforts should focus on a rapid primary survey and immediate aggressive intervention for any emergent life threats encountered. A more comprehensive secondary survey is then performed, aided by laboratory and imaging studies as outlined previously (Figure 87-6). TREATMENT ...... Blunt Thoracic Injuries Sternal and Rib Fractures Provided there are no corresponding injuries to underlying viscera, care of these injuries should focus on adequate anal\u00ad gesia. Suboptimal pain control can result in impaired lung ventilation and the potential for secondary pneumonia. Intercostal nerve block can be an invaluable for pain control. Pulmonary Contusions These injuries are treated supportively with supplemental oxygen via a nonrebreather mask to maintain adequate systemic oxygenati on. Patients with extensive contusions or those unresponsive to supplemental oxygen will require endotracheal intubation and positive pressure ventilation. Care must be taken to avoid overaggressively hydrating these patients to limit progressi ve alveolar edema and extension of the underlying contusion. Blunt Myocardial Injury Clinically significant injuries requmng aggressive intervention are very rare. Stable patients with normal initial ECGs can be discharged home without further evaluation. Patients with ECG anomalies should be observed for 12-24 hours on continuous telemetry to assess for the development of progressi ve dysrhythmias or cardiogenic shock. Patients who decompensate into car\u00ad diogenic shock should be managed via the appropriate Advanced Cardiac Life Support algorithms with the caveat that, for the most part, antiplatelet and anticoagulant medications should be avoided. Blunt Aortic Injury If possible, the systolic blood pressure (BP) should be aggressively lowered to -ll0-120 mm Hg to reduce the shearing forces on the vessel wall and limit the potential for aortic rupture. Ideal agents include a combination of intra\u00ad venous (IV) esmolol and either nitroprusside or nicardip \u00ad ine drips. Copious analgesia may be necessary to facilitate adequate BP control. Definitive treatment involves surgical repair or endovascular stenting. ...... Penetrating Thoracic Injuries Pneumothorax Almost all traumatic PTXs require tube thoracostomy within the ED. This is especially true of patients with bilateral PTXs or those undergoing positive pressure ven\u00ad tilation. Patients with an asymptomatic simple PTX smaller than 1 em on CXR and no visible HTX or those with PTX visible only on CT imaging (occult PTX) can be observed on 100% supplemen tal oxygen, with tube tho\u00ad racostom y reserved for those with evidence of increasing volume on serial imaging or the development of associ\u00ad ated symptoms. Tension PTXs require immedia te needle thoracostomy followed by chest tube placement. Open PTXs require placement of a 3-sided occlusive dressing over the wound to create a flutter valve and restore the integrity of the chest wall followed by subsequent tube thoracostomy. Hemothorax Almost all HTXs large enough to be detected on CXR should be drained with tube thoracostom y. Operative intervention is required in <5% of cases of HTX and should be reserved for cases of massive HTX with either initial volumes of evacuated blood > 1,500 mL, persistent chest tube output of >200 mL/hr over the first 2-4 hours, or hemodynamic instability despite aggressive volume THORACIC TRAUMA Operative vs. endovascular repair Intervene, stabilize, fr reassess Cardiac box .A. Figure 87-6. Thoracic trauma room. resuscitation. Autotransfusion should be considered in the majority of these patients. Penetrating Cardiac Injury Patients with loss of vital signs either in the field or ED should undergo emergent thoracotom y. Those with pericardia! tamponade from an anterior cardiac stab wound have the highest likelihood of survival. Unstable patients with signs of pericardia! tamponade either on physical exam or US should undergo emergent pericardiocentesis. Stable patients with evidence of bleed\u00ad ing in the pericardia! sac on bedside ECHO should be taken to the operating room for either a pericardia! win\u00ad dow or an operative thoracotomy. Penetrating Great Vessel Injury The majority of these patients who survive to ED presentation will require emergent operative intervention. Early endotracheal intubation should be considered given the potential for significa nt mediastina l hematoma CHAPTER 87 formation and secondary tracheal compromise. Any retained implements should be stabilized in place, and their removal should be performed only within the operating room. Tracheobronchial Injury All patients with presumed tracheobron chial trauma should undergo emergent bronchoscopy to determine the location and severity of injury. The majority of these patients will require operative repair. If necessary , endotrachea l intubation should be performed under bronchoscopic guidance to limit any further trauma to the tracheobronchial tree and prevent the aberrant placement of the endotracheal tube into a false soft-tissue lumen. DISPOSITION Admission The majority of thoracic trauma patients will require hos\u00ad pital admission. Hemodynamically stable patients with an isolated PTX or small HTX can be admitted to a standard hospital bed after chest tube placement. Patients with BMI or pulmona ry contusions should be admitted to either a telemetry unit or intensive care unit (I CU) setting depend\u00ad ing on the severity of symptoms. Patients with BAI, PCI, PGVI, or tracheobronchial injury will require operative intervention followed by an ICU admission. Discharge Patients with uncomplica ted rib or sternal fractures can be safely discharged home provided that their pain can be adequately managed. Stable penetrating thoracic trauma patients with a normal initial CXR and other\u00ad wise negative work-up should have repeat imaging per\u00ad formed within 3-6 hours to check for the development of a delayed PTX. If negative, these patients can be safely discharged home. SUGGESTED READING Bastos R et al. Emergency Medicine: Study Guide. 7th ed. New York, NY: McGraw-H ill, 2011. Keel M, Meier C.

Emery, MD Key Points A normal physical examination cannot be used as the sole means to exclude significant injury in patients with abdominal trauma. Hemodynamically unstable patients with penetrating injuries into the peritoneal cavity or blunt abdominal trauma and evidence of intraperitoneal hemorrhage require emergent laparotomy. INTRODUCTION Victims of abdominal trawna can present with intraperitoneal, retroperitoneal, and intrathoracic injuries. Intraperitoneal structures at a high risk of injury include the solid organs (liver and spleen), hollow viscera (small and large intes\u00ad tines), and diaphragm, whereas commonly involved retro\u00ad peritoneal structures include the kidneys and genitourinary ( GU) tract, duodenum, pancreas, and portions of the large intestine. The initial evaluation and management of patients with abdominal trawna can be divided by the mechanism of injury into blunt and penetrating pathways. Motor vehicle collisions (MVC) and significant falls account for the majority of cases of blunt abdominal trauma, whereas stab wounds (SW) and gunshot wounds (GSW) account for most cases of penetrating trauma. Keep in mind that the location of an entrance wound can fre\u00ad quently be misleading. Although a wound located on the anterior abdomen is obviously a high-risk injury, alterna\u00ad tive sites (lower chest, pelvis, back, or flank) can also result in significant intraperitoneal (or retroperitoneal) injury depending on the trajectory of the bullet, knife, or other wounding implement. When evaluating patients with penetrating trawna, the abdomen can be divided up into 4 distinct zones to help 381 Gunshot wounds that violate the peritoneum require operative exploration because of the high likelihood of injury. In patients with blunt abdominal trauma, negative computed tomograhy imaging has an excellent negative predictive value for excluding significant injury. predict which anatomic structures are at risk of injury. The anterior abdomen extends between the anterior axillary lines from the costal margins down to the inguinal liga\u00ad ments (Figure 88-1). The thoracoabdominal region extends circurnferentially around the entire trunk between the costal margins inferiorly and the nipple line or inferior scapular borders superiorly (Figure 88-2). Trauma to this region can injure intrathoracic and intraperitoneal struc\u00ad tures as well as the diaphragm. The flanks compose the third anatomical zone and extend between the anterior and posterior axillary lines from the costal margins to the iliac crests. Consider injuries to both intraperitoneal and retroperitoneal structures in this region. The final anatomical zone is the back, which extends between the posterior axil\u00ad lary lines from the inferior scapular borders to the iliac crests. Trauma to this region is most likely to result in retroperitoneal injury. MVCs account for the majority of cases of significant blunt abdominal trauma across all demographic groups, with the spleen by far the most commonly involved organ. With penetrating trauma, abdominal SWs are roughly 3 times more common than GSWs. That said, the latter accounts for roughly 90% of fatal injuries, as SWs are far less likely to violate the peritoneal cavity and cause significant injury. Abdominal GSWs most commonly CHAPTER 88 I r ..-\u00b7\u00b7- / .A. Figure 88-1. Anterior abdominal region. involve the small bowel, colon, and liver, as these organs take up the largest volume within the abdominal cavity. Abdominal SW s most common ly affect the liver, but laparotomy is required in only one quarter to one third of patients. The severity of injury is proportional to the amount of energy transferred to target tissues. Blunt abdominal trauma causes injury primarily by the direct transmission of exter\u00ad nal forces to underlying organs. Solid viscera, namely the spleen and liver, are the most likely structures to be involved. Hollow viscera can be injured when sudden crushing forces induce a rapid spike in intraluminal pressure and secondary rupture. Blunt trauma can also transmit shearing forces to underlying structures. Significant injury is most commonly seen in areas of transition from fixed to mobile positions such as the small bowel at the ligament of Treitz or the ileocolic junction. In penetrating trauma, SWs result in low-energy mechanisms that cause injury only to those tissues directly impacted by the stabbing implement. As most assailants are right-hand dominant, the left upper quadrant is the most likely region to be affected. GSW s, on the other hand, trans\u00ad mit substantial amounts of energy and frequently result in significant intra-abdominal injury. Missile size, stability, and velocity all help to determine the amount of energy imparted. High -velocity projectiles (> 2,000 ftl sec) as seen with combat wounds and hunting rifles can create waves of energy that result in temporary cavity formation and the disruption of tissues remote from the missile tract. In fact, intraperitoneal injury has been known to occur with high-velocity GSWs in the absence of peritoneal violation. Shotgun injuries are unique in that the velocity of the pellets decreases rapidly with the length of distance traveled. Furthermore, the spread of the pellets increases proportion ally to the distance between the victim and the shooter. Wounds with a pellet spread of 10-25 em most likely occurred at a distance of 3-7 yards and possess sufficient energy to penetrate into the peritoneal cavity. Finally, the potential for introducing con\u00ad tamination in the form of clothing or wadding further complicates GSW injuries. CLINICAL PRESENTATION ..... History A rapid primary survey and patient stabilization should always take precedence over a thorough medical history. That said, obtain a quick AMPLE (Allergies, Medications, Past illnesses, Last meal, Events preceding injury) history as with all trauma patients and ask focused questions to delineate the potential severity of mechanism. Emergency medical service personne l can provide invaluable informa\u00ad tion about the mechanism of injury, initial scene evalua\u00ad tion, and response to interventions provided during transport. With patients from an MVC, inquire about the Figure 88-2. Thoracoabdominal region. ABDOMINAL TRAUMA severity of vehicular damage, seatbelt use, airbag deploy\u00ad ment, need for patient extrication, and injuries to other occupants. For GSW victims, ask about the number of shots fired and the type of weapon involved. Ask all patients about the presence of abdominal pain, vomiting, hematemesis, and rectal bleeding. Pain in the shoulder that is not associated with either tenderness on exam or discomf ort with shoulder movement suggests that free intraperitoneal blood is irritating the diaphragm inducing referred pain (Kehr sign). Physical Examination Check a comple te set of vital signs and proceed with the primary survey. Any evidence of hemod ynamic instability suggests hemorrhagic shock and requires aggressive interve ntion. Perform a thorough examination of the chest and abdomen. Inspect the patient and note any contusions, hematomas, and abdominal distention. Lap-belt ecchymoses are highly con\u00ad cerning for underlying hollow viscus injuries or vertebral body (Chance) fractures. Note all open wounds and identify the zone of injury. GSWs may not follow a linear trajectory, and a thorough examination of the entire body is necessary to document all potential penetrating wounds. Look for retained implements and eviscerations as each require opera\u00ad tive intervention. Carefully palpate all4 quadrants to detect any point tenderness or signs of evolving peritonitis. Perform a rectal exam to assess for the presence of gross blood. Keep in mind that the abdominal examination in isolation lacks adequate sensitivity to identify all patients with significant injuries that require operative intervention. DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES Laboratory As with all victims of significant trauma, obtain a complete blood count, metabolic panel, coagulation studies, and type and screen. Serial hemoglobin measurements, and, if avail\u00ad able, bedside lactate and base deficit analysis may help to determine the severity of injury and physiologic response to resuscitation. Obtain a urine sample for rapid pregnancy testing, urinalysis, and toxicology screening. Hemod y\u00ad namica lly stable adults without evidence of gross blood on bedside urinary inspection do not require a urinalysis to search for microscopic hematuria, as significant GU injury is highly unlikely. Liver function tests and pancreatic enzymes are nonspecific and poorly predictive of injury severity. As such, they are of minimal clinical utility in the routine evaluation of patients with abdominal trauma. Imaging Obtain an upright chest x-ray (CXR) in all patients to detect subdiaphragmatic free air suggestive of an underlying hollow viscus injury or the intrathoracic herniation of abdominal viscera indicative of a diaphragmatic rupture. In patients with penetrating thoracoabdominal trauma, Figure 88-3. CT scan demonstrating a splenic lacer\u00ad ation (arrow). Note the free fluid around the liver. carefully review the CXR to rule out an underlying pneu\u00ad mothorax. Obtain an anteroposterior film of the pelvis in blunt trauma victims to rule out unstable pelvic fractures and stabilize any visualized injuries by tightly securing a bed-sheet around the patient's waist to tamponade off any active pelvic bleeding. Place radiopaque markers (eg, elec\u00ad trocardiogram leads) over any open wounds in GSW vic\u00ad tims before imaging to help determine the path of the projectile( s). Pursue computed tomography (CT) imaging of the abdomen and pelvis in all stable blunt trauma patients to detect solid organ injury and hemoperitoneum (Figure 88-3). This modality is especially useful in patients whose exams are limited by distracting injuries or altered mental status. With penetrating trauma to the back and flank, order a \"triple contrast\" CT scan (by mouth, intravenous, and per rectum) to rule out intraperitoneal and retroperitoneal injury. CT imaging can also be used to diagnose peritoneal violation in patients with abdominal SWs. Of note, CT imaging is inadequately sensitive to exclude small diaphragmatic inju\u00ad ries with penetrating thoracoabdominal trauma and isolated hollow viscus injuries with significant blunt trauma. PROCEDU RES FAST Scan Focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) imaging is a widely available bedside procedure that can detect volumes of free intraperitoneal blood as low as 100 mL. It is easy to perform, quick ( <5 minutes ), noninvasive, and readily repeatable. The sensitivity of a FAST exam is directly proportional to the volume of free intraperitoneal blood, and this modality is highly sensitive in cases in which intra\u00ad peritoneal hemorrhage is significant enough to produce hemodynamic instability. A positive FAST exam in an unstable patient with blunt abdominal trauma necessitates emergent laparotomy. See Chapter 8 for further details. CHAPTER 88 ..... Diagnostic Peritoneal Lavage (DPL) Although largely supplanted by less invasive modalities such as Cf and FAST, DPL may continue to play a role in the rapid bedside detection of free intraperitoneal blood in grossly unstable patients with equivocal FAST exams. This procedure can be broken down into 2 basic steps. Begin by inserting an 18-gauge needle into the peritoneal cavity and attempting to aspirate free intraperitoneal fluid. An aspirate of 10 mL of gross blood or obvious intestinal contents warrants operative laparotomy. In patients with negative aspirates, insert a guide\u00ad wire through the needle and place an intraperitoneal catheter via the Seldinger technique. Infuse 1 L of normal saline into the peritoneal cavity and then allow it to drain via gravity back into the empty saline bag. The collected fluid should then be sent to the lab for cell count analysis. In blunt abdom\u00ad inal trauma, a count > 100,000 red blood cells (RBCs)/JlL is considered the threshold for detecting significant visceral injury and the need for laparotomy. For abdominal GSWs, a count >5,000--10,000 RBCs/JlL is considered positive. For patients with thoracoabdominal SWs, a similar count of 5,000--10,000 RBCs/JlL is used to exclude diaphragmatic injuries. For all other abdominal SWs, a cut-off of> 100,000 RBCs/JlL is used. ..... Local Wound Exploration (LWE) This is a useful modality for excluding peritoneal violation in patients with anterior abdominal SWs. Carefully extend the margins of the injury as necessary to facilitate adequate visualization of the base of the wound. The use of copious local anesthetics is a must. This technique is far preferable to blindly probing the wound with blunt instruments. Assume peritoneal penetration in cases in which the base of the wound cannot be clearly identified. The deep exploration of thoracoa bdomina l wounds is generally avoided, although LWE may be reasonable to confirm the depth of very superficial slashing-type injuries. MEDICAL DECISION MAKING Begin all evaluations with a rapid primary survey and complete set of vital signs. Emergent laparotomy is generally indicated in all unstable patients with either penetrating abdominal trauma or blunt abdominal trauma and positive FAST imaging. Regardless of hemodynamic condition, patients with GSWs that clearly violate the peritoneal cavity require emergent laparotomy due to the high rate of significant underlying injury. Hemodynamically stable patients warrant a work-up before deciding on the need for surgery. For victims of penetrating trauma, this might include LWE with anterior abdominal SWs, plain radiographs to localize radiopaque foreign bodies, FAST imaging to look for pericardia! and intraperitoneal free fluid, CT imaging to help determine the need for and approach to any operative intervention, and DPL to rule out diaphragmatic injury or peritoneal violation. For victims of blunt trauma, the work-up generally includes an upright CXR to look for intraperito\u00ad neal free air, gross diaphragmatic rupture, and pneumo\u00ad thorax/hemothorax along with plain films of the pelvis to rule out fracture. These images are usually followed by abdominal CT to exclude injuries to the solid abdominal viscera. Additional findings that warrant emergent laparot\u00ad omy include retained foreign bodies, eviscerations, frank peritonitis, hematemesis or gross rectal bleeding, and imag\u00ad ing studies documenting hollow viscus or diaphragmatic perforation (Figures 88-4 and 88-5). TREATMENT Initiate aggressive volume resuscitation and address any emergent life threats encountered in the primary survey. Concurrently search for any sources of active hemorrha ge to determine the need for operative interventio n as described previousl y. A growing percentage of solid organ injuries in hemo\u00ad dynamically stable patients are being managed nonopera\u00ad tively. This decision should be made on a case-by-case basis in consultation with the trauma service. The conservative \"watch and wait\" approach has a failure rate of 10% for liver injuries and 20% for injuries to the spleen. The evolv\u00ad ing use of angiographic embolization for bleeding vessels has decreased the need for laparotomy in many cases. DISPOSITION ..... Admission Admit all patients who require laparoto my. Hemo\u00ad dynamically stable patients with CT evidence of liver or splenic injury warrant admission for serial physical exams and laboratory testing. ..... Discharge Patients with abdomina l SWs and tangential low-velocity GSWs that clearly spare the peritoneal, retroperitoneal, and intrathoracic cavities can be safely discharged. Normal CT imaging in hemodynamica lly stable patients with blunt abdomina l trauma has an excellent negative predictive value. In the absence of other injuries, these patients can be safely discharged. SUGGESTED READING Isenhour JL, Marx JA. Abdominal trauma. In: Marx JA, Hockberger RS, Walls RM.

Tan, MBBS Key Points Pursue early endotracheal intubation in patients with significant inhalation injuries. Emergency escharotomy may be a life-or limb-saving procedure in patients with evidence of respiratory com\u00ad promise or limb ischemia. INTRODUCTION Burn injuries can occur from thermal, chemical, or electrical mechanisms. Of the 3, thermal burns are the most common and occur with either scalding or flame injuries. Chemical burns occur secondary to exposures to strong acids or alkali and account for 5-10% of all burn admissions. Electrical burns result from the flow of current through susceptible tissue and are frequently much more severe than initially visible. The prevalence of burns is highest in patients between 18 and 35 years of age. Scald burns from hot liquids are most common in children under the age of 5 and the elderly, and approximately 20% of pediatric burns are attributable to either abuse or neglect. The American Burn Association estimates that burns account for more than 450,000 emergency department (ED) visits, 45,000 hospitalizations, and 3,500 deaths annually in the United States. There are currently 125 specialized burn centers in the United States that account for more than half of these admissions. Burned skin classically undergoes a coagulative necrosis by which denatured skin proteins constrict to form a firm and potentially constricting eschar. A subsequent cascade of inflammatory reactions leads to the development of significant localized edema and the potential for further tissue loss. This inflammatory response becomes systemic Consider concurrent carbon monoxide andcyanide poi\u00ad soning in all fire victims. Never overlook the possibility of concomitant multi\u00ad system trauma, and always consider the possibility of abuse or neglect in burned children or the elderly. when more than 30% of the patient's total body surface area is involved, resulting in multisystem organ injury. Burns can be clinically classified as first, second, or third degree. First-degree burns are limited to the superficial epidermis and heal within 7 days without any long-term sequelae (eg, sunburn ). Second-degree burns are partial-thickness injuries that extend into the dermis. They are further subdivided into superficial and deep partial thickness injuries. Deep partial thickness burns result in destruction of the deeper dermal structures including the hair follicles and sweat and sebaceous glands, whereas these tissues are spared with superficial partial thickness injuries. Superficial partial thickness burns tend to heal within a period of 2-3 weeks with minimal long\u00ad term scarring, whereas their deep counterparts often necessitate skin grafting for definitive care. Third-degree burns extend deep into the subcutaneous tissues and represent full-thickness injuries of the skin. All dermal structures including the capillary networks and neuronal tissues are destroyed, leaving behind an avascular and insensate skin. Skin grafting is invariably required. From a physiologic standpoint, the skin functions to reduce evaporative water loss, in addition to creating a barrier to infection and controlling body temperature. Hypovolemic shock is common with severe burns as a result of a combination of increased peripheral blood flow with evaporative fluid losses and excessive capillary leak with 387 CHAPTER 89 circulating volume third-spacing. The decreased cardiac out\u00ad put that frequently complicates the systemic reaction to sig\u00ad nificant burns further exacerbates the circulatory insufficien cy. Inhalational injuries are common in fire victims who are found in enclosed spaces. They can be divided anatomically into supraglottic and infraglottic injuries. Supraglottic burns represent direct thermal injury to the face and pha\u00ad ryngeal tissues. They develop very rapidly, within minutes of exposure, and often necessitate emergent endotracheal intu\u00ad bation. Infraglottic burns represent chemically mediated injury to the bronchioles and alveoli. They develop much more slowly over the course of several hours and clinically mimic acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). CLINICAL PRESENTATION History Details concerning the nature of the injury are extremely important. Identify the mechanism of injury, as this may provide a clue its severity. For example, scald injuries usually result in partial-thickness burns, whereas flash and flame exposures more commonly produce full-thickness injuries. Deeper injuries should be suspected in patients with electrical or chemical burns, especially those with high voltage or strong alkali exposures, respectively. Identify all victims of closed space fires, as they have an increased potential for inhalational injuries, carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning, and cyanide (CN-) toxicity. Cyanide is formed by the combustion of nitrogen-containing compounds ( eg, wool, silk, polyurethane, vinyl), and toxicity is not uncom\u00ad mon in victims of industrial fires. Obtain a very detailed history in all pediatric burn victims to uncover any possi\u00ad bility for abuse or neglect. Physical Examination Always start with a primary survey and address any emergent life threats. Carefully document all vital signs, remembering that circumferential extremity burns may limit adequate blood pressure measurement. Assess the patient for any signs of inhalation injury, including singed facial hairs, carbonaceous sputum, stridor, wheezing, and dysphonia. Carefully assess the adequacy of respiration in all patients with significant thoracic burns to detect any evidence of an evolving compromise in chest wall compliance. Completely undress all patients and perform a comprehensi ve secondary survey, as concomitant traumatic injuries are common. Assume an occult C-spine injury until proven otherwise in all nonverbal or unreliable patients and immobilize appropria tely. Ensure intact neu\u00ad rovascular function in all 4 extremities and take note of any circumferential burns. Perform a detailed skin exam in all patients. First\u00ad degree burns are red in appearance and very tender. Skin blistering should not be present. Superficial second\u00ad degree burns present with red blistered skin, a moist 18% front 18% Figure 89-1. The \"rule of nines\" to calculate the % total body surface area of the burn. Reprinted with per\u00ad mission from Schwartz LR, Balakrishnan c. Chapter 210. Thermal Burns. In: GO, eds. Tintinalli's Emergency Medicine: A Comprehensive Study Guide. 7th ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, 2011. exposed dermis, and good capillary refill. Deep second\u00ad degree burns, on the other hand, present with an exposed dermis that is a pale white to yellow in appear\u00ad ance with absent capillary refill. Third-degree burns are leathery, pale, and insensate with possible evidence of char formation. Calculate the percentage of total body surface area (TBSA) involved with second-and third-degree burns. The \"rule of nines\" can help with this assessment (Figure 89-1). Immersion burns will appear as circumferential tissue damage with sparing of the flexor creases and are pathognomonic for abuse in pediatric patients. DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES Laboratory Obtain an electrolyte panel and renal function in all patients and calculate the anion gap. Significant metabolic acidosis suggests hemodynamic shock, carbon monoxide poisoning, or cyanide toxicity. Check an arterial blood gas in patients with potential CO poisoning to measure the carboxyhemo\u00ad globin level. Order a creatine phosphokinase to exclude rhabdomyolysis in patients with electrical injuries. Imaging Obtain a chest x-ray (CXR) in patients with potential inha\u00ad lation burns, keeping in mind that infraglottic burns may take several hours to evolve. Their appearance on CXR typically mimics ARDS. PROCEDU RES Emergency escharotomy is indicated in all patients with circumferential burns and evidence of either impaired limb perfusion or restricted respiratory mechanics secondary to the development of an inflexible skin eschar with underlying edema. For the limbs, opposing mid\u00ad medial and mid-lateral incisions should be made down the entire length of the eschar, including the digits if necessary. For the chest, bilateral incisions should be made along the anterior axillary lines. An additional transverse horizontal incision is occasionally necessary to fully free the restricted chest wall. Regardless of location, the incisions must com\u00ad pletely penetrate through the entire eschar and into the subcutaneous fat. Consider co and CN\"\" poisoning in critically ill patients with smoke exposure BURNS MEDICAL DECISION MAKING Perform an appropriate primary survey and address any emergent life threats, including concomitant trauma. Secure the airway early in all patients with evidence of significant supraglottic inhalation injury. Rule out CO and CN-poisoning in all seriously ill patients with any history of smoke exposure. Use the history and a compre\u00ad hensive secondary survey to identify the extent and sever\u00ad ity of injury. Calculate the TBSA involved and initiate aggressive volume resuscitation in patients with burns involving more than 20%. Consider early transfer to an appropriate burn center in such patients (Figure 89-2). TREATMENT Administer 02 via a nonrebreather mask to all patients and administer pain medications as needed. If intubation is required, succinylcholine can be used safely within the first 24 hours after a burn, but its use should be avoided after this point to avoid precipitating life-threatening Burn victim Primary survey, IV access, 100% Fi02, cardiac monitor, analgesia Criteria for admission or transfer to regional burn center Calculate OfoTBSA involved and initial fluid requirements (Parkland formula) Figure 89-2. Burns diagnostic algorithm. TBSA, total body surface area. CHAPTER 89 hyperkalemia. This can occur because significant burns drastically increase then umber of postsynaptic acetylcholine receptors in the affected tissues, which can induce a massive efflux of potassium ions into the extracellular space in response to succinylcholine administration. Treat CO poisoning with 100% oxygen and possibly hyperbaric 02 (see Chapter 58) and CN- toxicity with either the cyanide antidote kit (use only the sodium thiosulfate with concurrent CO poisoning) or hydroxocobalamin (5 g intravenously [IV] over 15 minutes). Initiate aggressive volume resuscitation in all patients with burns that involve 20% TBSA. Use the Parkland formula (4 mL/kg x o/oTBSA given over 24 hours with the first half given over the initial 8 hours) to estimate initial volume needs, but titrate as necessary to maintain hemodynamic stability and a urine output of 0.5-1 mg/ kg/hr. For example, an 80-kg patient with a 50% TBSA burn requires 16 L of total fluid over a 24-hour period with an initial rate of 1 L/hr for the first 8 hours. Use either Lactated Ringer's or isotonic saline, as colloid fluids have never been shown to improve survival. Irrigate all thermal and chemical burns with cool running water to minimize further tissue injury, and remove affected clothing to limit ongoing chemical exposure. Brush off any adherent solid chemicals before irrigation. Apply nonadherent sterile dressings to all superficial injuries. Deeper burns will require debridement of necrotic tissue and protection with a topical antiseptic such as silver sulfadiazine. Most of these injuries will eventually require surgical excision and skin grafting. As local wound care is exceptionally painful, burn victims require aggressive analgesia with parenteral narcotics. Update your patient's tetanus status as necessary. DISPOSITION Admission The criteria for admission or transfer to a burn center are listed in Table 89-1. Table 89-1.

Patton, MD Key Points When assessing a painful extremity, vascular compro\u00ad mise must be excluded first. A patient who has fallen on an outstretched hand and has tenderness in the anatomical snuffbox of the wrist and a negative radiograph should have a thumb spica splint placed until a scaphoid fracture is definitively excluded. INTRODUCTION Traumatic injuries to the upper extremity are common presenting emergency department (ED) complaints. It is the clinician's objective to distinguish benign ( eg, sprains, contusions) from emergent injuries (eg, open fractures, dislocations, vascular compromise ). A systematic approach to identifying and classifying orthopedic injuries is needed to properly manage, treat, and disposition patients. This requires a thorough knowledge of orthopedic anatomy and function. The upper extremity contains several impor\u00ad tant articulations and long bones, which are at risk for dislocations and fractures during falls or by direct force. Shoulder and Arm Injuries The glenohumeral joint of the shoulder is the most mobile joint in the body and, unsurprisin gly, the most commonly dislocated joint, accounting for 50% of all major disloca\u00ad tions seen in the ED. Anterior dislocations account for 95% of all shoulder dislocations (Figure 90-1). They occur most commonly when the arm is abducted, externally rotated, and extended and a posterior directed force is applied to the humerus. Axillary nerve injury is present in 12% of cases and is noted by testing sensation over the deltoid muscle and strength of abduction. Posterior dislocations 391 Avoid nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs after frac\u00ad tures. These medications inhibit bone healing. In the upper extremity, compartment syndrome is most common in the forearm, espe cially after displaced supracondylar fractures in children. areless common (5%) and present with inability to abduct and externally rotate. The classic mechanism that causes a posterior shoulder dislocation is a seizure. .A. Figure 90-1. AP view of an anterior shoulder dislocation. CHAPTER 90 Figure 90-2. Humerus fracture. This fracture is described as a spiral, distal-third humerus fracture, with comminution, 100% displacement, and no angulation. Shoulder separation is a soft tissue injury to the acromioclavicular and coracoclavicular ligaments, which provide stability to the acromioclavicular joint. These typi\u00ad cally occur after a fall with direct impact onto the shoulder and are divided by severity into first-, second-, and third\u00ad degree injuries. First-degree injuries are sprains of the acromioc lavicular ligament without significant separation of the acromion and clavicle. Second-degree injuries are the result of complete disruption of the acromioclavicular liga\u00ad ment but an intact coracoclavicular ligament. Widening of the acromioclavicular joint is present on radiographs. Third-degree injuries occur when both ligaments are dis\u00ad rupted, producing widening of the acromioclavicular joint and cephalad displacement of the clavicle. Humerus fractures occur anywhere on the shaft of the humerus (Figure 90-2). Fractures of the distal third of the humerus are associated with radial nerve injuries in 5-15% of cases . ..... Elbow Injuries The elbow is the second most common large joint dislocation, 80-90% of which are posterior. Common elbow fractures include the radial head and olecranon in adults and the supracondylar humerus in children. Displaced supracondylar fractures in children are prone to developing compartment syndrome. ..... Forearm Injuries A nightstick fracture is an isolated fracture of the ulnar shaft that occurs when a patient is protecting the body from a blunt force to the upper torso or head. Both bone forearm fractures (radius and ulna) are common in children after a fall. In both children and adults, these are highly unstable fractures that require early orthopedic consultation. Galeazzi fracture-dislocation is a distal radius fracture with dislocation of the ulna at the distal radioulnar joint (wrist). proximal ulna fracture with disloca\u00ad tion of the radial head at the proximal radioulnar joint (elbow). Both of these injuries require surgical reduction . ..... Wrist and Hand Injuries Distal radius fractures account for up to 15% of upper extremity fractures and are classified by the pattern of injury. They are most commonl y caused by a fall on an outstretched hand (FOOSH). A Colles fracture is an extra\u00ad articular metaphyseal fracture with dorsal angulation, as opposed to a Smith fracture, which is an extra-articular metaphyseal fracture with volar angulation (Figure 90-3). A Barton fracture involves the volar or dorsal rim of the distal radius with subluxation of the carpals. A Hutchinson fracture is an isolated fracture of the radial styloid. Of the 8 carpal bones, the scaphoid accounts for 60--80% of all fractures (Figure 90-4). These fractures have a significant A. Figure 90-3. Distal radius fracture is an example of a Calles fracture. UPPER EXTREMITY INJURIES Figure 90-4. Scaphoid fracture (arrow). risk of avascular necrosis due to the pattern of blood supply in this area, and this risk increases with more proximal frac\u00ad tures. The false-negative rate of plain radiographs is as high as 20%, making conservative treatment in patients with tender\u00ad ness over the scaphoid (anatomical snuffbox) appropriate. Metacarpal fractures may occur in the base, shaft, neck, or head of the bone. The most common is a fracture to the neck of the fourth and/or fifth metacarpal, called a boxer's fracture (Figure 90-5). Angulation is acceptable if it is Figure 90-5. Fracture of the neck of the fourth and fifth metacarpals-boxer's fracture (arrows). <40 degrees. For fractures of the metacarpal shafts of the second and third metacarpal necks, less angulation (10-20 degrees) is acceptable because healing with signifi\u00ad cant angulation in these more anatomically fixed metacar\u00ad pals may inhibit function. Injury to the ligaments of the wrist produces several patterns of injury observed on plain radiogra phs. Progressi ve ligamentous injury results in a characteristic sequence of injuries, from scapholunate dissociation, to perilunate dislocation and, finally, lunate dislocation. Scapholunate dissociation occurs when the interosseous ligament between the scaphoid and lunate is disrupted. On the anteroposterior (AP) radiograph, the joint space between the scaphoid and lunate is 2':3 rom, a finding termed the Terry Thomas sign. The other 2 patterns are best seen on the lateral radiograph. On this view, a line drawn through the center of the radius should transect the lunate and capitate. In a perilunate dislocation, the is malaligned, usually dorsally (Figure 90-6A). In a lunate dislocation, the lunate is in an anterior position and is tipped over like a \"spilled teacup\" (Figure 90-6B). Tendon laceratio ns are common after lacerations of the hand. Examination should include testing the move\u00ad ment and strength of the digit, as well as inspection of the tendon through its full range of motion. Flexor tendons are tested by noting flexion at the distal joint Mallet finger closed extensor tendon injury due to forced flexion of an extended distal phalan\u00ad geal joint. It may be associa ted with an avulsion fracture. This injury occurs common ly when a person attempts to catch a ball. CLINICAL PRESENTATION History The patient presenting with upper extremity inj ury must be assessed for other more urgent or life-threatening inju\u00ad ries such as head or torso trauma before focusing atten\u00ad tion on the extremity. A detailed history should attempt to identify the mechanism of injury, as this is often help\u00ad ful in determining the type of injury sustained. Careful attention should be paid to injuries associated with sig\u00ad nificant swelling and pain unrespon sive to narcotic medi\u00ad cations, as these may be signs of limb-threatening compartment syndrome. Physical Examination A thorough neurovascular assessment will help charac\u00ad terize the urgency of a patient's injury. This includes assessing pulses, skin color, capillary refill, and nerve functio n. The radial nerve performs wrist extension and provides sensation to the dorsal web space between the first and second digits and may be damaged by mid-shaft CHAPTER 90 A 8 .A. Figure 90-6. A. Peri lunate dislocation. Note that the lunate still articulates with the radius (horizontal arrow) but the capitate is dislocated dorsally (vertical arrow). B. Lunate dislocation. The lunate (arrow) is volarly dislocated and no longer articulates with the radius. humerus fractures. The ulnar nerve travels posterior to the medial epicondyle of the elbow and abducts, or spreads apart, the digits, and provides sensation to the fifth digit. The median nerve allows opposition of the thumb and fifth digit and supplies sensation to the first 3 digits. It is most frequently injured in supracondylar humerus fractures. After assessing for neurovascular integrity, evaluate for any gross deformities or swelling as well as any tenderness or \"tenseness\" that might suggest compartment swelling. Lacerations are noted, as these could represent open frac\u00ad tures. The entire extremity must be evaluated for second\u00ad ary injuries that may be overlooked by a more \"obvious\" source of pain, paying particular attention to adjacent joints. DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES Laboratory Laboratory studies are usually unnecessary in the evaluation and management of extremity injuries. IMAGING In most cases, plain radiographs are sufficient to diagnose upper extremity trauma. Both an AP and lateral view of the bone must be viewed to fully understand and describe a fracture. Imaging the joint above and below the fracture is helpful to identify associated injuries. Fractures must be described with a consistent language to properly manage and effectively communicate with consulting specialists. Common patterns include spiral, transverse, and oblique fractures. The degree of angulation, displacement, and level of comminution (see Figure 90-2) must be noted, in addition to the presence of intra\u00ad articular involvement, as these features frequently impact the definitive treatment plan. Shoulder radiographs include AP films in internal and external rotation, a scapular \"Y\" view, and an axillary view. The axillary and \"Y\" view are especially helpful in diagnos\u00ad ing the posterior dislocation. Wrist radiographs consist of AP, lateral, and oblique views. The carpal bones are best scrutinized on the AP radiograph. Overlap of the bones suggests a carpal dislocation (ie, lunate or perilunate ). The lateral view is best for detecting carpal dislocations and fractures of the distal radius and triquetrum. The oblique view allows for better visualization of the first metacarpal and the distal scaphoid. The scaphoid view, an AP view with ulnar deviation of the wrist, will increase the sensitiv\u00ad ity for detecting scaphoid fractures . Computed tomography ( CT) and magnetic resonance imaging are not routinely ordered but have an improved sensitivity over plain radiographs for detecting occult fractures (eg, scaphoid fractures). CT scans can also better characterize complicated fractures seen on plain radiographs. UPPER EXTREMITY INJURIES PROCEDURES Shoulder Dislocation Reduction An anterior shoulder dislocation can be reduced by several techniques. The external rotation maneuver places the patient sitting upright or at 45 degrees. The patient's elbow is supported in adduction by one hand while the other hand is used to slowly and gently externally rotate the arm. The shoulder may reduce spontaneo usly. If not, the arm is slowly abducted and the humeral head is lifted into the socket. Scapular manipulation involves pushing the inferior portion of the scapular tip medially while the superior aspect is rotated laterally. This movement shifts the glenoid inferiorly toward the humeral head, allowing it to reduce spontaneo usly. The Stimson technique relies on gravity to slowly fatigue the shoulder musculature and allow spontaneous reduction of the humerus in 20-30 minutes. The patient is placed in the prone position with the arm hanging over the side of the bed with 10- to 15-lb weights suspended from the wrist. MEDICAL DECISION MAKING Most upper extremity injuries can be clinically diagnosed by a thorough history and physical exam. An accurate neurovascular exam is invaluable in rapidly identifying potentially limb-threatening injuries such as a vascular injury or compartment syndrome. When a fracture is suspected, radiographs are necessary to properly charac\u00ad terize fracture patterns, which will often dictate both the acute management and overall disposition of a patient (Figure 90-7). Extremity pain or trauma Pulses present; good perfusion Thorough history and examination Assess need for radiographs and pain control Thorough neurovascular examination Pulses absent; poor perfusion Reduce fractures/ pulses Reduce dislocations/fractures and repeat radiographs Splint fractures or suspected fractures, as appropriate Discharge instructions Prescribe pain medications Give appropriate follow-up Figure 90-7. Upper extremity injuries diagnostic algorithm. CHAPTER 90 TREATMENT The general treatment of most orthopedic injuries involves rest, ice, compression, and elevation (RICE). Most fractures should be immobilized with a splint that supports the joint above and below the injury. Ice should be applied 3-4 times daily for no more than 20 minutes at a time during the first 72 hours. Elevation of the injury will also help reduce swelling and pain. Gentle compression with elastic bandages can provide additional support to soft tissue injuries, though tight wrapping can induce compartment syndrome. Narcotic medications are preferred for fractures. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may inhibit bone healing and are therefore recommended only for soft-tissue injuries without underlying fractures. ..... Shoulder Dislocation After successful reduction, apply a sling or shoulder immo\u00ad bilizer. The patient should be instructed to avoid external rotation of the arm, although early range of motion is often recommended for patients with shoulder injuries, especially in the elderly. ..... Shoulder Separation Initial treatment of a first-, second-, or third-degree injury is a sling and pain control. ..... Humerus Fracture A coaptation splint is applied for humeral shaft fractures, whereas a shoulder sling alone suffices for proximal frac\u00ad tures. Both injuries must be referred to an orthopedist for follow-up. Radial nerve injuries should be documented and are often managed conservatively. ..... Distal Radius Fracture Closed reduction is recommended for displaced fractures with immobilization in a sugar tong splint. ..... Scaphoid Fracture Because of the high risk of avascular necrosis with these fractures, a patient with wrist pain and anatomical snuffbox tenderness should be assumed to have a scaph\u00ad oid fracture and immobilized with a thumb spica splint and referred for follow-up, even if radiographs are negative. ..... Metacarpal Fracture These fractures will require reduction if significant angu\u00ad lation is present, followed by a radial or ulnar gutter splint. ..... Carpal Dislocation Placement in a volar splint and orthopedic consultation for reduction and operative repair. ..... Mallet Finger This injury must be splinted in extension for 6 weeks to allow for proper tendon healing. ..... Tendon Injury Treatment of open tendon injuries in the ED includes thor\u00ad ough wound irrigation, laceration repair of skin wounds if indicated, and prophylactic antibiotics. Extensor tendon injuries should be splinted in extension, whereas flexor tendon injuries are splinted in flexion. Complete open tendon injuries require referral to a hand surgeon for ten\u00ad don repair within a 7 -day period. DISPOSITION ..... Admission Admission is indicated after orthopedic consultation for irreducible fractures or dislocations, open fractures, suspected compartment syndrome, or planned surgical repair. Admission for observation should also be considered for any injuries that are at high risk for early complications such as infection or compartment syndrome, or those that render patients unable to care for themselves. ..... Discharge Most patients with upper extremity injuries are appropriate to discharge home after proper splinting and analgesia. Specific follow-up instructions and timing should be discussed if spe\u00ad cialist referral is indicated. Discharge instructions should emphasize the importance of returning for signs of infection, neurovascular compromise, or compartment syndrome.

Chen, MD Key Points If a hip fracture is suspected in an elderly patient, but plain radiographs are negative, obtain a computed tomography scan or magnetic resonance imaging. Delay in the reduction of a hip dislocation increases the likelihood of avascular necrosis of the femoral head. INTRODUCTION Lower extremity injuries are frequently caused by motor vehicle collisions (MVCs), pedestrian auto accidents, sports, and falls. These mechanisms often involve large forces, so concurrent torso injuries may be present. Fractures in patients with osteopenia and pathologic fractures occur after minor trauma. This chapter reviews lower extremity injuries from the hip to the foot and highlights some of the pitfalls in managing these orthopedic emergen cies. Hip Injuries Fractures at the hip are classified based on their location. Femoral neck (ie, subcapital) fractures are intracapsular and more likely to occur in elderly osteoporotic women. Displaced femoral neck fractures cause a hemarthrosis that compresses the femoral neck vessels and compro\u00ad mises the blood flow to the hip. This leads to avascular necrosis of the bone in 15-35% of cases and potential long-term disability. Intertrochanteric, subtrochanteric, and femoral shaft fractures are more likely to occur in young patients after a fall or direct blow to the knee (Figure 91-1). Hip dislocations are posterior in 90o/o of cases. They are caused by high-energy trauma, such as striking the flexed knee on the dashboard during an MVC. 397 The presence of normal distal pulses after a knee dislo\u00ad cation does not exclude popliteal artery injury. A fracture at the base of the second metatarsal should raise suspicion for a Lisfranc fracture-dislocation. .A. Figure 91-1. A displaced intertrochanteric fracture of the hip. CHAPTER 91 ..... Knee Injuries The knee is stabilized by 4 ligaments, the anterior and posterior cruciates and the medial and lateral collateral ligaments. Maneuvers such as cutting, squatting, and twisting motions can cause ligamentous and meniscus injuries. The popliteal fossa contains the popliteal artery and vein, the common peroneal nerve, and the tibial nerve, so fractures involving the femoral condyles or proximal fibula may be associated with popliteal artery or deep pero\u00ad neal nerve injury, respectively. Likewise, popliteal artery injuries may be seen with knee dislocations, even if distal pulses are palpable. Tibial plateau fractures, seen more commonly in older patients even after minor trauma, can be difficult to detect on plain radiogra phy. A proximal fibula fracture occurs from direct impact or when an external rotational force is applied to the foot or ankle that tears the interosseous membrane between the tibia and fibula, also called a Maisonn euve fracture. ..... Ankle and Foot Injuries Anatomic ally, the foot is into the hindfoot from the midfoot, whereas the Lisfranc joint divides the midfoot from the forefoot. A fracture of the second metatarsal base is associated with disruption of the ligaments that stabilize the Lisfranc joint. This results in dislocation of the other metatarsal bones. A Lisfranc fracture-dislocation occurs after severe plantar flexion of the foot with an abduction force, such as stepping off a sidewalk curb. Calcaneus fractures are often bilateral because the most frequent mechanism is a fall from height, landing on both feet. Lumbar spine fractures occur in 10% of patients with calcaneal fractures. The ankle is stabilized by the deltoid ligament, lateral ligament complex (anterior and posterior talofibular, and calcaneofibular ligaments ), and syndesmosis. The most common injury is an ankle sprain, 90% of which are inver\u00ad sion injuries. Ligamentous injuries and laxity is difficult to detect hours after an acute injury because of the surrounding ligamentous tension and muscle spasm. Other important lower extremity injuries to diagnose include Achilles tendon rupture and patella and quadriceps tendon rupture. CLINICAL PRESENTATION Patients with lower extremity injuries present with pain over the injured site, swelling, ecchymosis, deformity , limited range of motion, and/or inability to ambulate. During the primary survey, stabilizing the limb may limit blood loss, and reducing a fracture/dislocation may restore neurovascular function. The joints above and below the injury should be examined for deformities, shortening, rotation, lacerations, ligamentous instability, and neurovascular status. The physical exam can be very limited after an acute injury due to the pain associated with movement. Intertrochanteric fractures of the hip may leave the leg shortened, abducted, and externally rotated because of traction on the iliopsoas. Patients with nondisplaced hip fractures may be ambulatory , so physicians should have a low threshold for obtaining imaging. A posterior hip dislocation presents with a shortened, adducted, and internally rotated leg. A knee exam begins with inspecting for swelling, effusion, ecchymosis, and patella location, using the uninjured knee for comparison. Knee injuries, whether from a fracture, dislocation, or ligamentous injury, typically present with a hemarthrosis. Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears cause the majority of hemarthrosis (75%), but other etiologies include meniscal tears and fractures. The mecha\u00ad nism of injury for an ACL tear is a deceleration, hyperex\u00ad tension, or internal rotation of the tibia on the femur, associated with a \"pop\" and swelling that develops within hours. Ligamentous testing of the knee is outlined in Table 91-1. A history of locking of the knee suggests a meniscal tear. Knee dislocations are associated with tremendous ligamentous disruption. About half of all knee dislocations will have spontaneous ly reduced before presentation. Despite spontaneous reduction, there is still a high likelihood of popliteal artery and peroneal nerve injury. Palpation of the distal pulses is performed to assess the popliteal artery, but normal pulses are not sensitive enough to exclude arterial injury. In patients without evidence of vascular injury, an ankle brachial index (ABI) of >0.9 allows for safe observation without angiogra phy. The deep peroneal nerve is assessed by testing sensation on the dorsal aspect of the foot between the first and second toes. Ligament Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) Posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) Medial collateral ligament (LCL) Stress Test Lachman Posterior drawer Valgus stress test Varus stress test flexed to 30\u00b0, pull tibia forward; anterior displace\u00ad to pushed backwards; posterior displacement is positive Knee flexed 30\u00b0 and hanging off lateral aspect of bed; valgus force applied to leg while palpating the MCL Knee flexed 30\u00b0 and hanging off lateral aspect of bed; varus force applied to leg while palpating the LCL LOWER EXTREMITY INJURIES Some lacerations overlying the knee may be deep enough to extend into the joint capsule (ie, traumatic arthrotomy) . The knee is the most common joint to be affected. Once an underlying fracture has been excluded, the joint will need to be injected with saline or dilute methylene blue. If fluid flows out of the laceration when the joint is injected, then the joint has been violated and requires a wash out in the operating room. Patients with patella fractures and patella and quadriceps tendon rupture may be able to ambulate normally, but the extensor function of the knee is affected (ie, the patient would not be able to perform a straight leg raise). The posi\u00ad tion of the patella is notably altered on exam in patients with tendon rupture, particularly after a patella tendon rupture. Posttraumatic compartment syndrome causes severe pain that starts within a few hours after the injury (but can occur up to 48 hours), worsens with passive range of motion, and is associated with progressive swelling around the injured area. In the lower extremity, the most common location to develop compartment syndrome is the leg, usually after a tibia fracture. The 4 compartments of the leg are the anterior, lateral, posterior, and deep posterior. The most common ankle injury is a lateral ankle sprain. Patients will present with tenderness and swelling around the anterolateral aspect of the ankle and difficulty bearing weight. Grade I ankle sprains present with minimal functional loss, pain, and swelling. Grade II and III sprains involve partial and complete tear of the ligaments and result in significant functional loss. Achilles tendon rupture most commonly occurs after a weekend warrior (ie, middle-aged man who infrequently performs strenuous activities) applies a force to the dorsiflexed foot and then has sudden severe pain in the back of the leg. On examination, the calf is tender and swollen and there is a gap in the tendon about 2-6 em proximal to the calcaneus. The Thompson test is performed with the patient lying prone, knees bent at 90 degrees. If the foot does not dorsiflex when the calf is squeezed, then the tendon is completely tom. Fractures at the base of the fifth metatarsal have 2 common types--tuberosity avulsion fractures and Jones fractures. A tuberosity avulsion fracture occurs after an inversion injury to the ankle (Figure 91-2). Patients will present with pain in the lateral aspect of the foot that is worse with ambulation. By contrast, a Jones fracture is a more distal fracture of the fifth metatarsal shaft (within 1.5 em of the tuberosity). It occurs when a laterally directed force is placed on the forefoot during plantar flexion of the ankle. DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES ...... Laboratory Laboratory studies are usually not necessary when evaluating patients with lower extremity trauma, although they may be required for patients who need hospital admission or operative management for their injuries. Figure 91-2. Avulsion fracture of the base of the fifth metatarsal. ..... Imaging Plain radiography is the initial diagnostic imaging of choice for any lower extremity injury. If a hip fracture is suspected, adding an anteroposterior (AP) pelvis view to the routine hip AP, internal, and external rotation views enables the reader to compare the injured joint to the unaffected side. This is especially helpful in patients with severe degenera tive joint disease. In elderly patients with normal radiographs and persistent significant pain with weight bearing, computed tomography ( CT) or magnetic resonance imaging is useful for detecting an occult fracture. Routine knee radiographs include the AP, lateral, and oblique views. In the setting of acute knee trauma, a CHAPTER 91 patient meeting any of the criteria in the Ottawa knee rules (age >55 years, isolated patella tenderness, fibula head tenderness, inability to flex the knee to 90 degrees, and inability to ambulate 4 steps after the injury and in the emergenc y department [ED]) should receive knee radiographs. A high-riding patella on the lateral view indi\u00ad cates a possible patella tendon rupture. The presence of a fat-fluid level (ie, lipohemarthrosis) on the lateral view is an indirect sign of an intra-articular fracture. CT imaging may be required for determining the extent of tibial pla\u00ad teau fractures. An avulsion fracture at the site of the attachment of the lateral capsular ligament on the lateral tibial condyle (ie, Segond fracture) suggests an anterior cruciate ligament tear. Ankle films include AP, lateral, and mortise views (AP with 15-to 20-degree internal rotation). The Ottawa ankle rules help dictate which patients need ankle radiogra phs. Any patient unable to ambulate 4 steps after the injury or in the ED or who is tender over the posterior aspect of the medial or lateral malleoli should have imaging. A lateral talar shift on the AP or mortise views indicates a deltoid ligament rupture (Figure 91-3). It is present when the space between the medial malleolus and talus is greater than the distance from the talar dome (superior aspect of the talus) to the tibial plafond (inferior aspect of the tibia). Fractures may be isolated distal lateral malleolus, bimalleolar, or trimalleo lar (Figure 91-4). Routine foot films are AP, lateral, and internal oblique views. For foot injuries, the Ottawa foot rules (ie, inability to ambulate 4 steps after the injury or in the ED; or tenderness at the base of the fifth metatarsal or the navicular) help determine which patients should be imaged. If a calcaneus fracture is suspected clinically, calculate Bohler angle on the lateral view to identify subtle fractures and measure the degree of fracture depression (Figure 91-5). The lines of this angle are formed from the superior margin of the posterior Figure 91-3. Lateral talar shift indicating deltoid ligament disruption. Figure 91-4. A bimalleolar fracture of the ankle. tuberosity of the calcaneus through the superior tip of the posterior facet and from the superior tip of the ante\u00ad rior facet to the superior tip of the posterior facet. Normally, this angle is 20-40 degrees. If the angle is <20 degrees, an occult depressed calcaneus fracture should be suspected. On the AP view of the foot, the first 3 metatarsals should align with the 3 cuneiforms, the fourth and fifth metatarsals should align with the cuboid, and the medial portion of the middle cuneiform should align with the medial aspect of the second metacarpal. Any disruption to this alignment suggests a Lisfranc fracture-dislocation, and follow-up stress (weight-bearing) views should be obtained. A Lisfranc injury is present if there is any bony displacement greater than 1 mm between the bases of the first and second metatarsals. .A Figure 91-5. The normal Bohler angle is between 20 and 40 degrees. LOWER EXTREMITY INJURIES PROCEDU RES Joint dislocations and displaced fractures should be reduced in the ED to restore alignment and function. Procedural sedation is often required to relax the large muscle groups and facilitate manipulation of the bones and joints. Fractures or dislocations that are difficult to reduce with good alignment may require operative repair. There are 2 common maneuvers for reducing hip dislocations: the Allis and Bigelow maneuvers. In the Allis maneuver, an assistant applies downward pressure to the anterior superior iliac spines while the physician flexes the knee and hip to 90 degrees. Grasping the knee with both hands, simultaneously pull and rotate the femur laterally and medially until the joint pops into place. In the Bigelow maneuver, the patient is also placed in a supine position with the affected hip and knee flexed to 90 degrees. Secure the knee with a flexed elbow and grab the foot with the opposite hand. Using the flexed elbow to apply traction to the femur, externally rotate and extend the hip until the femoral head reduces. To reduce knee dislocations, apply gentle longitudinal traction to the lower leg while an assistant provides counter-traction on the thigh. Patella dislocations are treated by flexing the hip, hyperextending the knee, and sliding the patella back into place. Arthrocentesis may be a therapeutic benefit in patients with large knee effusions, although there is no good evi\u00ad dence of its efficacy and recurrence of the effusion can occur. Diagnostica lly, the presence of blood and glistening fat globules is pathognomonic of lipohemarthrosis, a sign of an intra-articular fracture. Ankle dislocation reduction is achieved by grasping the heel and foot with both hands and applying downward traction and rotation in the opposite direction to the mechanism of injury. MEDICAL DECISION MAKING With any limb injury, the integrity of the neurovascular status should be determined immediately (see Figure 90-7). As mentioned previously, knee dislocations or severely displaced tibia fractures may be associated with a popliteal artery injury, so patients with those injuries should undergo ABis \u00b1 evaluation with CT angiogra phy. There is poor collateral circulation around the knee, so the popli\u00ad teal artery circulation must be restored within 8 hours to prevent amputation. Compartment syndrome also should not be missed because it may develop after any traumatic injury. A tense, severely swollen limb should have its compartment pressures measured, along with serum creatinine phosphokinase and myoglobin levels. Patients placed in a splint after a sprain, nonoperative fracture, or reduced dislocation should be discharged with instructions to return for any signs or symptoms of compartment syndrome. TREATMENT Emergent orthopedic consultation should be obtained for compartment syndrome and all open fractures. Patients with open fractures should be copiously irrigated in the ED and given broad-sp ectrum antibiotics. ligamentous and meniscus injuries, tendon ruptures, and most nondisplaced fractures, the joint or injured area should be immobilized with a splint. Patients should be given crutches for ambulation. Pain may be controlled with narcotic analgesia for fractures and nonsteroidal anti\u00ad inflammatory agents for soft-tissue injuries for several days. Swelling is decreased with rest, ice, compression, and elevation (RICE). ..... Hip And Femur Fractures Fractures of the femoral head, neck, intertrochanteric, and femoral shaft require admission for operative reduction and internal fixation (ORIF). Hare traction splints can be used temporarily to stabilize femoral shaft fractures during transport (eg, prehospital setting), but are contraindicated in femoral neck fractures because they can compromise femoral head blood flow and cause avascular necrosis. ..... Knee Dislocation In the setting of popliteal artery injury, operative repair within an 8-hour time period is recommended. When reduction has been achieved and vascular injury has been excluded, immobilization and referral for surgery is appro\u00ad priate. ..... Patella Fractures And Dislocation Treated with analgesia, a knee immobilizer, and crutches with weight bearing as tolerated. Orthopedic referral for operative repair is indicated for displaced horizontal patella fractures. ..... Patella And Quadriceps Tendon Rupture Treated with analgesia, a knee immobilizer, and crutches with weight bearing as tolerated. Orthopedic referral for operative repair is indicated. ..... Tibial Plateau Fracture Tibial plateau fractures may be immobilized in a long leg posterior splint and referred for orthopedic evaluation within 24-48 hours. These patients should be given crutches and remain non-weigh t-bearing. ..... Ligamentous And Meniscal Injuries Treated with analgesia, a knee immobilizer, and crutches with weight bearing as tolerated. After 2-3 days of immo\u00ad bilization, patients should perform daily range of motion exercises (ie, 10-20 knee flexions and extensions 3-4 times a day) to prevent contractures and maintain mobility. CHAPTER 91 Orthopedic referral for possible operative repair is indi\u00ad cated. Tibia Fractures Because the tibia is the weight-bearing bone of the lower leg, many tibia fractures are admitted for operative repair. These patients have a high risk of developing compartment syndrome. Ankle Sprain Grade I ankle sprains should be immobilized for 1-2 days in an ankle brace followed by early range of motion and strength training exercises. Grade II and III ligamentous injuries should be stabilized in a short leg splint with the ankle in a neutral position. Achilles Tendon Rupture Support the ankle with a short leg posterior splint and refer to an orthopedist for operative repair, the preferred treat\u00ad ment for young or more active patients. The ankle is immobilized in slight plantarflexi on. Ankle Fractures And Dislocation Operative repair is the preferred treatment for ankle dislo\u00ad cations and unstable ankle fractures. Bimalleolar and tri\u00ad malleolar fractures are unstable injuries that are typically reduced in the ED, if needed, and referred for operative repair. An isolated distal lateral malleolus fracture is con\u00ad sidered to be a stable injury that can be immobilized in a short leg posterior splint and referred for orthopedic fol\u00ad low-up. Foot Fractures Non displaced fractures of the navicular and cuboid bones require a short leg splint. Calcaneus fractures require a bulky compressive dressing and a posterior splint. The patient will remain non-weight-bearing for 6-8 weeks. Metatarsal fractures should be immobilized in a posterior leg splint and treated nonoperatively, unless there is an associated Lisfranc dislocation, a displacement of more than 3-4 mm, or angulation of more than 10 degrees, all of which are managed operatively. Because of a tenuous blood supply, a Jones fracture requires a posterior leg splint and non-weight-bearing status for proper healing. Finally, phalangeal fractures are treated with buddy taping the injured toe to an adjacent toe and a hard-soled shoe. DISPOSITION Admission Admission is required for patients with hemodynamic instability (from acute blood loss) and fractures that are open, associated with multiorgan trauma, or require early ORIF (eg, hip fractures ). Discharge Most patients with nondisplaced fractures, ligamentous injury, or meniscus tears can be splinted and sent home with referral to orthopedics for further management (ie, cast or surgical repair). If non-weight-bearing status is required, patients must be able to ambulate with crutches or have home assistance with activities of daily living. SUGGESTED READING Newton EJ, Love J.

Casey, MD Key Points The diagnostic approach to lower back pain is facilitated by classifying back pain into (1) nonspe\u00ad cific low back pain, (2) back pain associated with radiculopathy, and (3) back pain due to a serious underlying cause. INTRODUCTION Acute low back pain may be due to a variety of conditions ranging from benign ( eg, muscle strain) to devastating ( eg, spina l cord compression from malignancy or abscess). For the clinician in the emergency department (ED), it is critical to develop a systematic approach that will allow one to differentiate and manage the minority of patients with conditions that threaten neurologic function from those with benign, self-limited etiologies. This chapter focuses primarily on the evaluation and management of acute ( <4 weeks) low back pain. An estimated 60-70% of adults in the United States will experience low back pain in their lifetime, and although only 25-30% will seek medical care, low back pain is an exceedingly common reason for ED visits in the United States. The economic impact of low back pain is s ubstan\u00ad tial, estimated to account for $26.3 billion of direct health care costs in the United States in 1998. The pathophysiology of nonspecific low back pain is usually indeterminate, as pain may arise from a number of sites including the vertebral column, surrounding muscles, tendons, ligaments, and fascia. The mechanism of injury to these structures varies from stretching, tearing, or contu\u00ad sion as a result of heavy lifting or torsion of the spinal col\u00ad umn. In contrast, the pathophysiology of radicular low back pain is more clearly defined. Herniation of the nucleus It is critical to screen for risk factors associated with serious back pathology as well as identify the presence of neurologic deficits. Imaging is indicated in select patients with significant risk factors and/ or neurologic deficits. pulposus through the annulus fibrosis causes compression of the dural lining around the spinal nerve root, resulting in radicular pain. CLINICAL PRESENTATION The history and physical examination serve as cornerstones in the evaluation of back pain. To facilitate a rational diagnostic approach, an attempt is made to classify low back pain into 1 of 3 categories: 1. Nonspecific low back pain: pain with no signs or symptoms of a serious underlying condition 2. Radicular back pain: pain with nerve root dysfunction associated with pain, sensory impairment, weakness, or impaired deep tendon reflexes in a specific nerve root distribution 3. Serious underlying etiology: pain with neurologic deficits or underlying conditions requiring prompt evaluation (eg, tumor, infection, fracture, cauda equina syndrome) ...... History The history should focus on the location of pain (including radiation of pain), frequency and duration of symptoms, and exacerbating and alleviating factors, as well as any 403 CHAPTER 92 Table 92-1. Risk factors for serious pathology in back pain. Risk factors for underlying malignancy Prior history of malignancy Age >50 years unexplained weight loss Failure to improve after 4 weeks Risk factors for vertebral infection Fever Intravenous drug use Recent infection Risk factors for vertebral compression fracture Old age History of osteoporosis Corticosteroid use previous episodes or treatments of back pain. Pain that radi\u00ad ates down the leg, usually past the knee, suggests a radicu\u00ad lopathy. Pain from a herniated disk is worse with movement, sitting, or Valsalva maneuver (eg, coughing). Pain worse at night or rest suggests malignancy or spinal infection. A past medical history of malignancy or immunocomprornise is determined. Inquire about recent weight loss or fevers. Patients should also be asked about severe or progressive neurologic deficits including motor deficits, fecal inconti\u00ad nence, and bladder dysfunction. Bilateral leg pain and bowel/bladder dysfunction suggests cauda equina syndrome. Other warning signs of serious disease underlying low back pain are listed in Table 92-1. Physical Examination The musculoskeletal exam should include percussion of the spinous processes of the back. Pain with percussion suggests spinal infection, vertebral malignan cy, or com\u00ad pression fracture. Tenderness and spasm of the paraspinal muscles frequently heralds muscle strain, but can also be seen in secondary condition (eg, epidural abscess). As a result, when other signs and symptoms for a serious back pain etiology are present, don't dismiss them just because the pain is reproduced by palpation of the paraspinal muscles. Patients should also undergo a complete neurologic assessment. Neurologic deficits that suggest spinal cord compression include spasticity, bilateral weakness, positive Babinski sign, multiple dermatomes, and bilateral reflex abnorma lities. Findings consistent with cauda equina syndrome are decreased sensation to light touch and pinp rick in the inner thighs and perineum (saddle anesthesi a), decreased rectal tone, and urinary retention with a post-void residual over 100 mL. Saddle anesthesia is seen in 75% of cases of cauda equina syn\u00ad drome, whereas an elevated postvoid residual is present in 90%. When a radiculop athy is suspected, perform the straight\u00ad leg raise and reverse straight -leg raise tests. A positive straight-leg raise (reproduction of the patient's radicular symptoms between 30 and 70 degrees of leg elevation) has a relatively high sensitivity ( 91%), but a low specificity (26%) for diagnosing a herniated disc. The reverse straight\u00ad leg raise is more specific (88%) but less sensitive (26%). Evaluate strength for nerve root dysfunction by testing knee strength (IA nerve root), great toe/foot dorsiflexion (LS nerve root), and foot plantartlexion (S1 nerve root). Sensory deficits in radiculopa thy include decreased sensation between the first and second toes (LS nerve root) and decreased sensation on the lateral aspect of the foot (S1 nerve root). Lastly, assess the pulses and palpate the abdomen for possible vascular causes of the pain, including aortic aneurysm. DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES Laboratory Laboratory testing generally plays a limited role in the evaluation of low back pain. Obtain a urine pregnancy test in females of reproductive age to exclude ectopic pregnancy and guide future decisions regarding imaging. A urinalysis may also be helpful to evaluate for nephrolithiasis or pyelonephritis as potential causes of low back pain. Although erythrocyte sedimentation rates and C-reactive protein may be elevated in some patients with back pain ( eg, epidural abscess, malignanc y), these studies are nonspecific and should not be routinely ordered as part of the work-up. Imaging Patients presenting with nonspecific low back pain with none of the high-risk features discussed previously do not warrant routine radiographic evaluation. Prompt evaluation with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) is recommended when severe or progressive neurologic deficits are present or when serious underlying conditions are suspected on the basis of history and physical exam. If available, MRI is preferred over CT because it provides better visualization of soft tissues, vertebral marrow, and the spinal canal. In patients suspected of a vertebral compression fracture (eg, osteoporosis, chronic steroid use), plain radiography is recommended (Figure 92-1). ACT should be considered if there is significant loss of height of the vertebral body or if any neurologic symptoms are present. Patients with an underlying malignancy with acute back pain should have an MRI on an urgent basis (within 24 hours) when no neurologic deficits are present. When neurologic deficits are present, the MRI is performed emergently. For patients with low back pain associated with radiculop athy, MRI (preferred) or CT are only recommended if the patient is a candidate for surgery or LOW BACK PAIN Figure 92-1. T12 compression fracture. epidural steroid injection, as the natural course of lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy is improvement within 4weeks. MEDICAL DECISION MAKING The history and physical exam serve as the cornerstones in the evaluation of low back pain. Eliciting risk factors indicative of a serious underlying condition ( eg, urinary retention concerning for cauda equina syndrome) or identifying neurologic deficits on exam should prompt advanced imaging. In the absence of risk factors, neurologic deficits, or symptoms suggestive of a potentially serious cause, the source of the low back pain is most likely benign, and reassurance and symptomatic management with outpatient follow-up is recommended (Figure 92-2). TREATMENT The treatment of low back pain varies depending on the identified etiology. For those patients with nonspecific low back pain, symptomatic therapy should include advice to remain active and application of heat as needed. Acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have shown short-term benefits. One must weigh the potential analgesic benefit from NSAIDs with the known risks of their use. Opioid analgesics or tramadol are an option for patients with severe, debilitating pain that is not controlled with acetaminophen or NSAIDs, but again, they should be prescribed judiciously and for very limited peri\u00ad ods given the risk of medication interactions and potential for abuse. Musculoskeletal relaxants are approved by the Lower back pain/trauma Perform a focused history & physical exam for: Duration of symptoms Risk factors for potentially serious conditions Symptoms suggestive of radiculopathy or spinal stenosis Presence & severity of neurologic deficits Risk factors and/or neurologic deficits PRESENT Perform diagnostic studies (x-ray, CT, MRI) to identify specific cause Risk factors and/or neurologic deficits ABSENT Symptomatic managem ent, outpatient follow-up No specific cause identified\u00ad symptomatic treatment with close outpatient follow-up Figure pain diag nostic algorithm.

CHAPTER 92 Food and Drug Administration for treatment of musculo\u00ad skeletal conditions or spasticity and are another option for short-term use in acute low back pain. When a specific etiology for low back pain is identified, the treatment varies depending on the underlying pathology. Low back pain with radiculop athy (in the absence of focal neuro\u00ad logic deficits) can be treated symptomatical ly, as most patients recover without surgery. Patients diagnosed with vertebral osteomyelitis require intravenous (N) antibiotics, whereas an epidural abscess is treated with neurosurgical evaluation for potential drainage as well as parenteral antibiotics. Neurosurgical consultation should also be obtained immedi \u00ad ately for patients with cauda equina syndrome. In patients with vertebral malignancy with new neurologic deficits, e mer\u00ad gent radiation to shrink the tumor and relieve cord compression is advised. The administration of corticosteroids (dexamethasone 10 mg N) for acute spinal cord compression should also be considered in consultation with neurosurgery. DISPOSITION Admission The patient disposition depends primarily on the etiology of the back pain as well as analgesic control of symptoms. Patients found to have a serious underlying etiology of low back pain (eg, cauda equina syndrome, epidural abscess) should be admitted in consultation with neurosur gery. It is also reasonable to consider observation for patients with nonspecific low back pain (with or without radiculopathy) when pain control cannot be achieved in the ED. Discharge Patients with nonspecific low back pain or back pain with radiculopa thy in whom pain is reasona bly controlled can be discharged with outpatient follow-up. All patients should receive patient education regarding self-care and treatment for low back pain as well as indications to return to the emergency department ( eg, development of neurologic deficit, change in urinary or bowel functions).

Compartment Syndromes Marc Doucette, MD Key Points Compartment syndrome occurs when tissue pressure in a closed space rises, compromising perfusion to nerves and muscles. The leg and forearm compartments are most commonly involved, but compartment syndrome can also occur in the upper arm, thigh, hand, foot, gluteal region, or abdomen. INTRODUCTION Acute compartment syndrome is a surgical emergency. If unrecognized and untreated, it can lead to tissue ischemia, necrosis, and long-term functional impairment. Volkmann ischemic contracture is the end result of an ischemic injury to the muscles and nerves of a limb. Compartment syndrome is seen most commonly in the setting of trauma, including long bone fractures, crush injuries, and circumferential burns to the extremities. Males and young people are affected more commonly than females and elderly. The pathophysiology of compartment syndrome involves increased pressure in a muscle compartment that is enclosed by a fascial structure with limited ability to expand. This increased pressure is caused by edema or bleeding, from compression of the compartment by a circumferential burn or a constricting cast, or a combination of both. Increased pressure leads to decreased venous outflow from the compartment, causing a decrease in the arteriovenous pressure gradient and ultimately cellular ischemia and tissue necrosis. Cardinal signs and symptoms include severe pain over the involved area, pain with passive stretch of the muscles in the affected compartment, weakness, and paresthesias. Although commercially available devices can be used to Compartment syndrome is usually associated with long bone fracture, crush injuries, circumferential burn, or cast. Acute compartment syndrome is a surgical emergency, treated by fasciotomy to relieve pressure and restore circulation. measure compartment pressures, the diagnosis is often made on clinical grounds alone. Early recognition and orthopedic consultation are essential in preventing tissue necrosis and adverse outcome. CLINICAL PRESENTATION ..... History Acute compartment syndrome is seen most commonly in the setting of trauma or long bone fracture. Significant blunt trauma or crush injury can lead to compartment syndrome, even in the absence of fracture. Symptom onset is usually within hours of injury, but can present up to 48 hours after the traumatic event. Historica lly, the symptoms of compartment syndrome have been described by the \"the five Ps\": pain, pallor, paresthesias, pulselessness, and poikilothermia. However, all of these are not typically present, and many are late findings that signal irreversible injury. The primary complaint in the alert patient is usually of severe pain in the affected limb, often not controlled by opioid analgesics. The pain is often worsened by passive stretch of the muscles in the involved compartment. Nerve ischemia can lead to a burning sensation or dysesthesia. 407 CHAPTER 93 ..... Physical Examination Detection of compartment syndrome requires a high clinical suspicion and an attentive exam. The involved compartment is swollen and tense. There is exquisite tenderness to palpation. Pain is intensified if the examiner passively stretches the muscles of the compartment. Sensory deficits may be present, but motor weakness is usually a later finding. Pulselessness is a rare and late finding, as the arterial pressure usually exceeds the tissue pressure. Thus, the limb often remains warm with normal color, pulses, and capillary refill. In the alert patient, the absence of pain, paresthesias, and pain with passive stretch excludes the diagnosis of compartment syndrome. DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES ..... Laboratory Laboratory testing is not helpful in making the diagnosis of compartment syndrome. In the setting of extensive muscle damage, creatine phosphokinase or myoglobin may be ele\u00ad vated. .... Imaging Although diagnostic imaging studies are routinely used to evaluate the traumatized limb for associated orthopedic fracture, they are not required to make the diagnosis of compartment syndrome. The presence of significant or comminuted long bone fractures should heighten the provider's concern for the development of compartment syndrome. PROCEDU RES When there is doubt about the clinical diagnosis of compartment syndrome, such as in a patient with an unre\u00ad liable exam due to altered mental status, compartment pres\u00ad sures should be measured. Pressures can be objectively measured using a commercially available handheld manom\u00ad eter, such as the Stryker device (Figure 93-l). These instru\u00ad ments contain a needle connected to a pressure monitor. The needle is inserted into the muscle compartment at the most tense point, or near the fracture site. A small amount of saline is injected into the compartment, and the manom\u00ad eter reads the resistance to injection created by the tissue. Pressure should be checked at a minimum of 2 locations within the affected compartment and can be checked in a normal compartment for comparison. Normal tissue pressure in a muscle compartment is <10 mm Hg. Pressures up to 20 mm Hg are generally well tolerated. Pressures between 20-30 mm Hg may cause damage if they persist over multiple hours. Pressures >30 mm Hg are generally considered an indication for an emergent fasciotomy. More recent studies suggest that a more important number is the difference between the patient's diastolic blood pressure and the tissue pressure, or \"delta pressure.\" These studies suggest that a delta Figure 93-1. Stryker STJC device. Reprinted with permission from Hutson AM, Rovinsky D. Chapter 63. Compartment Pressure Measurement. In: Reichman EF, Simon RR, eds. Emergency Medicine Procedures. New York: McGraw-Hill, 2004 . pressure of >30 mm Hg is an indication for fasciotomy, whereas patients with delta pressure <30 mm Hg have a low likelihood of developing tissue damage if fasciotomy is withheld. MEDICAL DECISION MAKING History and physical exam along with a high index of suspicion may be all that is required to make the diagnosis of compartment syndrome. Measurement of compartment pressures can serve as a diagnostic tool. Failure to make the diagnosis and respond appropriately can lead to tissue damage and long-term functional deficits (Figure 93-2). TREATMENT The definitive treatment for an acute compartment syndrome is emergent fasciotomy. To minimize tissue dam\u00ad age, fasciotomy should be performed <8 hours and prefer\u00ad ably <6 hours after the onset of symptoms. Emergency department (ED) management involves early orthopedic consultation as soon as the diagnosis is confirmed. The patient should be hydrated and hypotension should be avoided. The affected limb should be kept at the level of the heart and not elevated. Elevation of the limb above the level of the heart reduces the arterial pressure and may reduce perfusion. Generous analgesia is often required. Fasciotomy is performed by an orthopedic or general surgeon in the operating room setting. A long incision is made in the skin and fascia, allowing the contents of the compartment to swell without increasing pressure. The incision is usually closed several days later, when the swelling has diminished. Sometimes skin grafting is necessary.

Because the history and physical examination has limi\u00ad tations, arthrocentesis should be performed in anyone suspected of having a septic arthritis. INTRODUCTION Emergency physicians' greatest concern and diagnostic dilemma when faced with patients presenting with nontraumatic acute joint pain is septic arthritis. The invasion by bacteria and the associated immune response can lead to rapid joint destruction and irreversible loss of function. Yet, despite the severity of the condition, misconceptions about patient presentations and the evaluation of patients with possible septic joints persist in all aspects of health care. Septic arthritis affects approximately 2-10 people per 100,000 annually and is frequently encountered in the emer\u00ad gency department (ED) setting. Once infected, the joint cartilage is rapidly injured, with up to 30% of patients expe\u00ad riencing residual damage and up to 10% dying as a result of the septic joint. Septic arthritis typically affects young chil\u00ad dren and adults older than 55 years; however, any age group can be affected. The microbiology of septic joints can be divided into 2 groups: nongonococcal and more common than contiguous extension from a local cellulitis or penetrating injury. Although the incidence of gonococcal arthritis has declined over the past 2 decades, it is the leading cause of septic arthritis among sexually active individuals and causes 5% of all septic joints. A combination of the patient's presentation, risk factors, and synovial fluid tests determine appropriate manage\u00ad ment decisions. CLINICAL PRESENTATION History Nongonococcal Septic Arthritis Patients typically develop symptoms over the span of hours to days. Symptoms present in more than half of patients with septic arthritis include joint pain, joint swelling, and fever. Sweats and rigors are less common findings. Patients will typically splint the joint and resist any active or passive range of motion. If patients have a history of similar episodes, the likelihood of septic arthritis decreases and the likelihood of other forms of arthritis increase. Although typically monoarticular and affecting the knee, polyarticular involvement occurs in 10% of cases. Risk factors for septic arthritis include immunosuppression (eg, diabetes), injection drug use, elderly, prosthetic joint, and previous joint injury (eg, rheumatoid arthritis). Gonococcal Septic Arthritis Gonococcal septic arthritis typically has a slightly differ\u00ad ent presenta tion. A prodroma l phase with migratory arthritis and tenosynovitis is the major feature before one or more joints become involved. Patients may describe features of gonococ cal disease such as vaginal discharge, pelvic pain, penile discharge, or pustules on the hands. 410 SEPTIC ARTHRITIS Physical Examination Although patients can appear toxic, most patients will not have vital sign abnormalities, including fever. The goal of the examination is to attempt to distinguish a joint infection from inflammation or infection of the surrounding struc\u00ad tures (bursa, tendons, skin). A septic joint typically has dif\u00ad fuse swelling, redness, and warmth. Pain severely limits both active and passive range of motion. This is in contra\u00ad distinction to inflammation or infection of surrounding structures, in which pain is more severe with active range of motion. Gonococcal arthritis may have more subtle signs. It commonly affects the wrist, knee, and/or ankle and is asso\u00ad ciated with tenosynovitis, rash, and migratory arthritis. Immunocompromised patients and those with prosthetic joints also have more subtle exam findings. In these patients, less of an immune response is generated with invasion of the joint. Therefore, the classic teaching of a red, hot, swollen, painful joint does not always predict septic arthritis. DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES Laboratory There is no one laboratory test that can rule in or out a septic joint. Frequently ordered tests in the evaluation of patients with painful joints include a complete blood count, erythro\u00ad cyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein. However, these tests lack sensitivity and specificity and should not be used in determining the need for arthrocentesis. Synovial Fluid Analysis The synovial white blood cell (WBC) count has been shown to have a wide variety of sensitivity and specificity. Although one specific number cannot be used as a cutoff, patients with counts >50,000/!lL should be considered septic until proven otherwise. The likelihood of a septic joint can be reduced with counts <25,000/!lL (Table 94-1). Nonetheless, 10% of patients with septic arthritis have synovial fluid leukocyte counts <10,000/!lL. A lower synovial WBC count is more common in immunocompromised patients and those with prosthetic joints. In prosthetic joints, a synovial WBC count > 1,1 00/!lL is concerning for an infectious etiology. Although the number of WBCs can be helpful, the type of WBCs is less helpful. Some reference a synovial polymorphonuclear cells count >90% as a rule-out criteria; however, its sensitivity has ranged from 60% to in several studies. Synovial lactate and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) have been shown to be predictive of septic arthritis if their levels are greater than >5.6 mmol!L and >250 U/L, respectively. Gram stain and culture should always be performed; however, negative results can occur in septic arthritis, especially in the setting of gonococcal disease. Gram stain is positive in approximately 60-80% of cases on nongonoco ccal septic arthritis. Synovial crystals suggest a Table 94-1. Synovial fluid findings based on condition.

Imaging Radiographs have a limited role in the diagnosis of septic arthritis and are typically performed to exclude other disease processes. PROCEDU RES Arthrocentesis Once the area is cleansed with Betadine or chlorhexidine and anesthetized via local infiltration, an 18-gauge needle (for large joints) or 20-to 25-gauge needle (for smaller joints) is used to puncture and then aspirate the joint space. General principles to performing successful arthrocentesis include always inserting the needle over the extensor surface, applying approximately 20 degrees of joint flexion, and using slight distraction of the joint. Prosthetic joints benefit from orthopedic consultation before arthrocentesis. Hip arthrocentesis is associated with a high rate of complication and ultrasound or fluoroscopic guidance is useful. Overlying cellulitis and coagulop athy are relative contraindications to performing arthrocentesis. MEDICAL DECISION MAKING Table 94-2 includes a differential for the presentation of patients with joint pain. If a clinician suspects a septic joint, then an arthrocentesis should be performed with labs sent for synovial WBCs, LDH, lactate, crystals, Gram stain, and culture. Based on the results of these fmdings, appropriate disposition can be determined (Figure 94-1). CHAPTER 94 Table 94-2. Differential diagnosis for acute joint pain and swelling.

Chap. Acute Disorders the joints and Bursae. GO. Tintina/lis Emergency Medicine: A Comprehensive Study Guide. 7th ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, 2011. TREATMENT Emergency physicians must combine the clinical presentation with the synovial fluid results to determine whether the patient should be treated for a septic arthritis. Treatment includes administering intravenous antibiotics and provid\u00ad ing adequate analgesia. There are no randomized controlled trials for antibiotic selection; therefore, choice of antibiotic is based on the suspected pathogen. Vancomycin should be given if Staphylococcus is suspected, especially with the rising prevalence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Additional treatment with ceftriaxone is suggested, especially in the set\u00ad ting of presumed gonococcal arthritis. Consultation with an orthopedic surgeon should also be obtained for consider\u00ad ation of open irrigation in the operating room. DISPOSITION Admission Patients who are presumed to have a septic joint based on presentation and laboratory evaluation should be admitted to the hospital for intravenous antibiotics and possible open irrigation. For patients with an undetermined cause and continued pain, consider possible admission or orthopedic consultation to monitor the cultures and symptoms. Acute onset of joint pain and swelling Figure 94-1. Septic arthritis diagnostic algorithm. SEPTIC ARTHRITIS Discharge Patients who are felt not to be suffering from septic arthritis can be treated with pain control and follow-up with an orthopedist, rheumatologist, or their primary care provider based on the suspected etiology of the joint pain.

In acute injuries, splints are preferable to circumferen\u00ad tial casts to limit the potential for iatrogenic compart\u00ad ment syndrome. INDICATIONS Fracture immobilization is extremely important to ensure proper healing, relieve pain, and stabilize bony fragments. Most acute injuries in the emergency department (ED) are immobi\u00ad Iized with the use of splints (instead of casts) to prevent the consequent swelling from inducing a significant increase in tissue pressures. Of note, not all fractures require splinting, and in some situations, prolonged immobilization can lead to con\u00ad tracture formation and the long-term loss of function. In most cases, the extremity is placed in the position of function before immobilization (Table 95-1). The joints immediately distal Table 95-1. Proper joint position for immobilization after most of immobilization is important to facilitate proper healing and limit secondary joint stiffness. Always maintain a low threshold for splint application in situations with strong clinical concern but normal radio\u00ad graphs, as some fractures may be occult on initial imaging. and proximal to the fracture should be included in the splint to ensure proper stabilization of the injury. Splints are indicated for the majority of extremity fractures and certain soft tissue injuries such as reduced joint disloca\u00ad tions (Table 95-2). Splint placement is also warranted when Table 95-2. Recommended method of immobilization for common fractures seen in the ED.

In some cases, fractures that are not visible on the initial radiographs may become visible on repeat imaging performed several days to weeks later. Splints Posterior Leg Splint This splint extends along the posterior aspect of the leg from the toes to just below the knee (short leg) or to the middle of the thigh (long leg) (Figure 95-1). Fractures at the knee (ie, tibial plateau) require the placement of a long leg splint, whereas fractures of the ankle require only a short leg splint. Apply an additional U-shaped splint (\"stir\u00ad ankle fractures ( eg, bimal\u00ad leolar fracture). It should extend from the area just below the knee on the medial aspect of the leg, around the heel, to the same position on the lateral aspect of the leg. Coaptation Splint The coaptation splint is the preferred splint for fractures of the humeral shaft. This splint extends from above the A B Figure 95-1. Lower extremity splints. A.

SPLINTING shoulder joint down the lateral aspect of the arm, around the elbow, and then up the medial aspect of the arm to the axilla (Figure 95-2A). The weight of the splint applies gentle continuous traction to the fractured humerus to aid proper reduction and healing. Sugar-Tong Splint This splint is so named because it resembles the shape of the tongs used to grab a cube of sugar for coffee or tea. With the elbow positioned at 90 degrees of flexion, this splint extends from the dorsal aspect of the hand at the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints, around the elbow, to the flexor crease of the palm (Figure 95-2B). The sugar\u00ad tong splint is useful for both distal radius fractures and fractures of the radial and ulnar shafts. Long Arm Posterior Splint The long arm posterior splint extends along the ulnar aspect of the forearm from the palmar crease to the middle portion of the upper arm and functions to immobilize the wrist and elbow (Figure 95-2C). It is used for both forearm fractures and injuries to the elbow. Gutter Splint (Radial And Ulnar) These splints are positioned on either the radial or ulnar por\u00ad tion of the hand and forearm and extend two thirds of the way up the forearm (Figure 95-2D). Both splints include the fin\u00ad gers (fourth and fifth digits for an ulnar gutter, second and third digits for a radial gutter). For the radial gutter splint, a hole is cut out for the thumb. These splints are useful for frac\u00ad tures of the metacarpals and phalanges of digits 2 through 5. Dorsai \"Ciam Digger\" Splint This splint is applied to the dorsal aspect of the hand and forearm and extends the length of the digits (Figure 95-2E). The hand is cupped in such a way that when the splint is applied, patients appear like they could go \"digging for clams on the beach.\" The hand is kept in the \"wine glass position;' with care to ensure that the MCP joints are immobilized between 60 and 90 degrees of flexion. This splint is useful in cases of multiple hand bone fractures that a gutter splint cannot properly immobilize. Thumb And Thumb Spica Splints A thumb splint extends from the distal aspect of the first digit to two thirds of the way up the forearm and is used to immobilize the thumb. This splint is useful for thumb fractures and injuries to the ulnar collateral ligament of the first MCP (gamekeeper's thumb). A thumb spica splint is similar but includes the addition of a volar splint that extends from the palmar crease to two thirds of the way up the forearm. Further extending this volar splint beyond the elbow to the mid-upper arm ensures full immobilization of the thumb, wrist, and elbow. This splint is used to immobilize fractures of the scaphoid as it prevents both pronation and supination of the forearm (Figure 95-2F). CHAPTER 95 A B ( 0 E F G Figure 95-2. Upper extremity splints.

Splints, Casts, and Other Techniques. In: Simon RR, Sherman sc, eds. Emergency Orthopedics. 6th ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, 2011. Finger Splints These splints can be rapidly placed using commercially available malleable padded materials (Figure 95-2G). Finger splints are used to protect the digits after phalangeal fractures. Alternatively, a dynamic finger splint can be used when a minor ligamentous sprain occurs at a proximal interphalangeal joint. Apply this functional splint by taping the proximal and middle phalanx of the injured digit to an uninjured neighboring finger (buddy taping). CONTRAINDICATIONS There are no absolute contraindications to splinting. Ensure proper wound care for all lacerations or open wounds before splint application. When re-evaluating such a patient, remove the splint to inspect for subsequent wound infection. EQUIPMENT Supplies include stockinette, cotton padding, fiberglass or plaster splint material, scissors, warm water, and elastic bandages. PROCEDURE Place a stockinette on the involved extremity extending beyond the proximal and distal limits of where the splint will be applied (optional). Use the patient's noninjured extremity to measure the correct length of necessary material. Cut either prefabricated fiberglass or approxi \u00ad mately 10-15 sheets of plaster to the proper length. ..... Fiberglass Most EDs use fiberglass splinting material as its application is both easy and quick. It comes prefabricated with a layer of padding wrapped around the fiberglass. It should be placed on the injured extremity after lightly wetting the fiberglass component with warm water. Important tips when using fiberglass splint material include: 1. When working with fiberglass rolls, clamp the unused end of the protective covering immediately after cut\u00ad ting the splint material. This prevents prolonged air exposure and subsequent hardening of the entire roll. 2. Some prefabricated fiberglass splint material has a padded side and a nonpadded side. Remember to place the padded side against the skin. 3. Stretch the padding longitudina lly to ensure that it covers the cut ends of the fiberglass, as exposed edges that remain in direct contact with the skin after hardening can induce skin injury (Figure 95-3). ...,._Plaster When applying a plaster splint, start by circumferentially wrapping several layers of cotton padding around the affected extremity. Take special care to apply extra layers of padding over bony protuberances ( eg, the malleoli) where excessive pressure might induce underlying skin necrosis. Finally, remember to place extra padding between all involved digits. Briefly soak the premeasured plaster in a bath of warm water. Remove excess water by wringing the plaster between the hands and smooth out the sheets by holding them up with one hand while the thumb and index finger of the other SPLINTING Figure 95-3.

As the calcium sulfate in the plaster reacts with the water it will produce heat as it cures, which the patient will notice as the splint is applied. Place the splint on the appropriate extrem\u00ad ity and add an additional layer of cotton padding over the plaster (optiona l). This will prevent the final layer of the splint (elastic bandage) from adhering to the drying plaster. Circumferentially wrap the extremity and splinting mate\u00ad rial (whether fiberglass or plaster) with an elastic bandage, taking care to ensure that the splint remains in the desired position when finished. Avoid over-tightly wrapping the extremity to prevent the development of a secondary com part\u00ad ment syndrome. Instruct the patient to not move the extremity until the splint has adequately hardened (5-10 minutes). COMPLICATIONS Circumf erential bandages, especially when applied too tightly, may produce an iatrogenic compartment syndrome. Instruct the patient to return to the ED with the development of any worsening pain or new numbness or tingling of the extremity. Addition ally, plaster splints will produce a signifi\u00ad cant amount of heat as they dry, which can result in thermal injuries when insufficient cotton padding is used .

General principles and appendix. In: Simon RR, Sherman SC. Emergency Orthopedics. 6th ed. z. Pitzele, MD Chad 5. Kessler, MD Key Points Rapid identification of life-threatening rashes and immediate treatment can be life-saving. INTRODUCTION Cutaneous lesions can be the first clinical sign of a serious systemic illness. It is important to recognize and treat these illnesses early. Life-threatening dermatoses can be grouped into 3 distinct categories: erythrodermas red rashes), vesiculobullous lesions, and hemorrhagic scalded skin syndrome (SSSS) is an exotoxin\u00ad producing Staphylococcal infection that causes shedding of the superficial layer of the epidermis. SSSS is most com\u00ad mon in children and neonates; 98% of patients are <6 years of age. Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) causes a diffuse red macular rash associated with fever, hypotension, and malfunction of at least 3 organ systems. It was originally diagnosed in menstruating women using vaginal tampons, but can also be seen in patients with surgical wounds and nasal packings. Incidence is about 10-20 cases per 100,000 persons. TSS is most often caused by a variant of Staphylococcus aureus, which produces the exotoxin TSST -1, which mediates the clinical effects. Streptococcus pyogenes may more rarely cause a similar syndrome. Kawasaki disease is thought to be an immunologic disorder triggered by infection or toxin, leading to a gen\u00ad eralized vasculitis . It causes nearly 3,000 hospi tal admis\u00ad sions annually and usually appears in children <9 years of age, with a peak incidence in children 18-24 months If there is any uncertainty of etiology in a given case, treat presumptively for the most serious etiology, especially menin gococcemia. of age. Epidemics occur primarily in the late winter and early spring. Approximately 20% of patients develop cardiovascular complications, and the most common cause of death is myocardial infarction secondary to coronary artery aneurysm, which can develop 2-8 weeks after fever. Vesiculobullous Lesions Erythema multiforme (EM), as the name implies, presents with many simultaneous types of skin lesions, including macules, papules, and bullae. EM accounts for as many as 1% of dermatologic outpatient visits and is more common in spring and fall. The etiology is a hypersensitivity reaction precipitated by medications, infections, sarcoidosis, collagen vascular diseases, or malignancies. About 50% of cases are idiopathic. Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) is a more severe form of EM that involves ;:::2 mucosal surfaces such as eyes, lips, mouth, urogenital area, anus. SJS can prog\u00ad ress to necrolysis large bul\u00ad lae and sloughing of the epidermis in sheets. Frequency is up to 6 cases per 1 million persons annu ally. The etiology is similar to EM, but medications are more common ly associated with SJS. TEN is the most severe end of the EM spectrum, with TEN affecting > 30% of the body surface area. There is approximately 1 case per 1 million persons annually, with adults most commonly affected. TEN desquamates the entire thickness of the epidermis; therefore, mortality rates 418 LIFE-THREATENING DERMATOSES are 30-40% from hypovolemia and infection. TEN is thought to be provoked by drugs such as phenytoin, sulfas, penicillins, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Onset is usually within the first 8 weeks of therapy. Pemphigus vulgaris (PV) is characterized by flaccid bullae that begin in the mouth and spread to involve the skin. Frequency is approximately 3 cases per 100,000 per\u00ad sons. Peak age of onset is 50-60 years. The etiology is an autoimmune blistering reaction characterized by autoanti \u00ad bodies directed against keratinocyte cell surfaces; some cases are drug-induced. Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is a similar autoimmune blistering disease, but it usually only affects the elderly. Unlike PV, the bullae of BP are tense rather than flaccid, and oral involvement is uncommon . ..... Hemorrhagic Lesions Patients with disseminated gonococcal infection (DGI) are usually young, sexually active females with fever, skin lesions, arthritis, arthralgias, or migratory tenosynovitis. DGI occurs after approximately 1% of gonococcal genital infections. Certain subtypes of Neisseria gonorrhoeae are more likely to lead to disseminated infection. Another Neisseria species, Neisseria meningitidis, can cause meningococcemia. Cutaneous manifestations are part of a hemorrhagic cascade resulting from systemic sepsis. The frequency is approximately 2 cases per 100,000 persons annu\u00ad ally, although sporadic outbreaks with higher prevalence occur frequently. The mortality rate varies between 10% and 50%, depending on the severity of the systemic infection. CLINICAL PRESENTATION ..... Erythrodermas SSSS generally begins on the face (perioral area) as red patches that are warm and tender. The erythema spreads and becomes flaccid clear bullae, which then desquamate in large sheets. The mucous membranes usually are not involved. Nikolsky sign is positive and can be elicited when gentle stroking of the skin produces peeling (Figure 96-1 ). Exfoliation begins on day 2 of the illness, and healing occurs within 10-14 days. The TSS patient will present with fever, hypotension, and multisystem organ dysfunction. In addition to diffuse erythroderma, patients will have a strawb erry-appearing tongue, red conjunctiva, and edema of the face, hands, and feet. The rash fades within 72 hours and is followed by acral desquamation within 1-2 weeks. The rash of Kawasaki disease is erythematous and similar in morphology to Scarlet Fever. The clinical diag\u00ad nosis of Kawasaki disease includes fever greater than 5 days' duration, plus 4 of 5 of the following criteria: con\u00ad junctivitis, oral mucous membrane involvement (straw\u00ad berry tongue, cracked lips), edema/ erythema of extremities, diffuse maculopapular rash, and cervical lymphaden opa\u00ad thy (usually> 1.5 em and unilateral ).

Vesiculobullous EM the \"target lesion;' described as erythematous plaques with dusky centers and bright red borders resembling the \"hull's eye\" of a target (Figure 96-2). The lesions are symmetric and are usually found on the extremities, palms, and soles and may also involve the oral mucosa. A burning sensation is present, and pruritus is notably absent. Stevens-Johnson syndrome presents with lesions similar to those of EM, but has additional findings of blistering of <10% of the skin and mucosal involvement. Fever, malaise, myalgias, and arthralgias are common. Lesions begin on the dorsal surfaces of the hands and feet and spread centrally. Toxic epidermal necrolysis begins with a prodrome of constitutional symptoms including fever, malaise, and myalgias. After 1-2 weeks, the skin becomes painful with hot red blisters and large areas of sloughing (>30% of skin), progressing to diffuse exfoliation and acute skin failure (Figure 96-3).

The classic rash of meningococ cemia can be petechial or macular, with pale gray vesicular centers, and may progress to a hemorrhagic rash (Figure 96-4). Fever, headache, and vomiting are present, although men\u00ad ingitis may or may not be present. It is rapidly progressive, with a 100% mortality rate without treatment. DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES Unfortunately, there are no diagnostic studies that can aid the emergenc y department (ED) diagnosis of these diseases.

However, the results of none of these tests will be available or useful to guide the initial diagnosis in the ED. MEDICAL DECISION MAKING The initial diagnosis should be made clinically and will be centered on the evaluation for specific life-threatening con\u00ad ditions. It is easiest to first attempt to classify the patient's presenting skin lesion-erythroderma, vesiculobullous, or hemorrhagic lesion-and, once subclassified, to attempt to use a few clinical features to rule in or rule out specific diagnoses (Figure 96-5). However, because it is sometimes difficult to make a certain diagnosis in the initial presenta \u00ad tion, the key to early treatment is to have a very high index of suspicion for the most immedia tely lethal of the 96-4. of meningococcemia.

They should be admitted to the hospital. Patients with TSS should first have the source (tampon, nasal packing) identified and removed. IV immunog lobulin G (IVlG) has been shown to be effective in neutralizing the TSS toxin and aids in recovery. These patients should also receive IV antibiotics ( eg, nafcillin/vancomycin) and be admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU). When Kawasaki disease is diagnosed, high-dose aspirin therapy and IVlG should be administered. Patients should be admitted to the hospital for further monitoring and echocardiography . .....

Palivos, MD Key Points Epinephrine is the first-line medication for the treat\u00ad ment of anaphylaxis. Second-line treatment consists of antihistamines and corticosteroids. Urticaria may be the first sign of what might progress to angioedema or anaphylaxis. INTRODUCTION An allergic reaction is the body's way of responding to foreign substances that come in contact with the skin, nose, eyes, respiratory tract or gastrointestinal tract. Examples of allergens are dust, pollen, plants, medications, foods, latex, and insect bites. Anything can be an allergen. Allergic reactions can range from mild local urticarial eruptions to severe and life-threatening airway obstruction, respira\u00ad tory failure, and circulatory collapse. Urticaria, or \"hives;' is an immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated hypersensitivity reaction to an allergen resulting in red, raised wheals that itch and sting. Circulating antibodies bind the allergen and IgE receptors on mast cells. In response, mast cells release inflammatory substances (histamine, bradykinin), which results in increased vascular permeability. Urticaria is one of the most common skin lesions seen in the emergency department (ED) in both young and older patients. About 20% of the population experiences at least 1 attack of urticaria in their lifetime. Angioedema is nonpitting edema of the deeper layers of the skin owing to a loss of vascular integrity caused by inflam\u00ad matory mediators. It is not pruritic but can cause burning, numbness, or pain, generally in the face or neck. Approx\u00ad imately 94% of the cases of angioedema presenting to the ED are drug-induced. Most drug-induced angioedema occurs in patients taking angiotensin-converting enzyme For patients with respiratory symptoms or throat swell\u00ad ing, perform a rapid assessment of the airway and intubate early. Attempt to determine and then discontinue the inciting agent. (ACE) inhibitors. About 0.1-0.2% of the patients treated with ACE inhibitors will develop angioedema. There are 2 main types of angioedema based on the underlying mechanism. Mast cell angioedema is mediated by IgE, similar to urticaria. Bradykinin, an inflammatory mediator, is causal in both hereditary and ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema, although the mechanism for the bradykinin increase differs. Anaphylaxis is a severe systemic allergic reaction that can present rapidly with hypotension, bronchospasm, and laryngeal edema. About 500-1,000 persons in the United States die every year as a result of anaphyla xis. Beta-lactam antibiotics and Hymenoptera stings constitute the most common causes of anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis is 1gB-mediated and results from release of histamine, leukotrienes, and prostaglandins from infl ammatory cells. sys\u00ad temic increase in vascular permeability, vasodilation, and smooth muscle contraction. CLINICAL PRESENTATION History Patients with urticaria present with transient, pruritic, well\u00ad circumscribed lesions that are erythematous, nonpitting plaques by an erythematous ring (flare) (Figure 97-1 ). Patients with angioedema present with swelling 423 CHAPTER 97 .A Figure 97-1. Urticaria. Reprinted with permission from Kane KS, Bissonette J, Baden HP, et al.

ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema has a predilection for the face (Figure 97-2). Patients with anaphylaxis present with a sensation of impending doom or \"lump in the throat\" followed by shortness of breath, chest pain, hypotension, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. More than 90% of patients have urticaria or angioedema. Most patients present with signs and symptoms within seconds of exposure to an allergen; however, symptoms may be delayed up to a few hours after exposure. .A Figure 97-2. Angioedema of the lips. Reproduced with permission from Sarah M. Granlund. If the patient is stable, try to identify the inciting factors. Ask about history of allergies, medications, exposures, contacts, underlying illness, diet, and family history of aller\u00ad gic reactions. Physical Examination Initial evaluation of the patient should focus on airway, breathing, and circulation (ABCs). Airway obstruction is evidenced by swelling of the lips, tongue, or uvula. The patient may have hoarseness, stridor, wheezing, or respiratory distress. The patient may exhibit erythema, urticaria, pruri\u00ad tis, or angioedema of the face, neck, or extremities. In patients with ACE inhibitor angioedema, the face is involved in 86% of cases. Once a patient is hemodynamically stable, a more detailed physical exam should be performed. Examine the skin while the patient is undressed and describe the rash. Include the type (macular, papular, vesicular ), size, shape, number, and color of the rash. Remove the allergen if it can be identified. For example, remove stinging remnants from insect bites . DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES Diagnosis of urticaria, angioedema, and anaphylaxis is based on clinical symptoms, and no specific laboratory or imaging tests are necessary. MEDICAL DECISION MAKING History and physical examination should be sufficient to arrive at the diagnosis of acute allergic reactions, especially if there is clear history of an exposure, such as a bee sting. Diagnosis is not always obvious because anaphylaxis symp\u00ad toms may mimic other presentations such as myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, syncope, status asthmati\u00ad cus, or sepsis. Urticaria may be confused with a viral rash, erythema multif orme, or a vasculitis. Infection (cellulitis), contact dermatitis, and renal or liver disease may mimic angioedema (Figure 97-3). TREATMENT Anaphylaxis with airway compromise and hypotension is a true medical emergency and must be rapidly assessed and treated. The most important step in treatment is the rapid administration of epinephrine. Initial stabilization consists of ABCs, cardiac monitoring, oxygen, and intravenous (N) fluids. Further treatment depends on the severity and extent of the reaction. When the airway is threatened, early intubation is lifesaving. Epinephrine is indicated in patients with angioedema when the airway is compromised or in patients with bronchocon\u00ad striction or hypotension from anaphylaxis. If the patient is normotensi ve and without signs of cardiovascular collapse, administer 0.3--D.S mg intramuscularly (IM) (0.3--D.S mL of 1:1,000 [1 epinephrine 5-10 until ALLERGIC REACTIONS Antihistamines, steroid, remove allergen Figure 97-3. Allergic reactions diagnostic algorithm. a positive response. IM dosing provides better blood epi\u00ad nephrine levels than subcutan eous administration. Injections into the thigh are more effective than injections into the deltoid area. If the patient does not respond or is hypotensive with signs of cardiovascular compromise, give epinephrine 0.1 mg IV slowly over 5 minutes (1 mL of 1: 10,000 solution [ 1 mg/1 0 mL]). If the patient is refractory to the bolus, then an epinephrine infusion should be corticosteroids and anti\u00ad histamines. H1 blockers (diphenhydramine) should be administered by mouth (PO) or IM for mild reactions and IV for more severe reactions. An H2 blocker in combination with H1 blocker should be administered to patients with severe urticaria, angioedema, or anaphylaxis. Choices include famotidine 20 mg IV, ranitidine 50 mg IV; or cimeti\u00ad dine 300 mg N. Corticosteroids should be administered for all moderate to severe reactions (prednisone 40 mg PO or methylprednisolone 125 mg IV). For treatment of bron\u00ad chospasm, add an albuterol nebulizer, ipratropium bromide, with hereditary and ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema are usually refractory to treatment with epinephrine, antihistamines, and corticosteroids. However, it is difficult to distinguish these from angioedema due to an IgE-mediated reaction, which respond to these therapies. In the presence of an acutely ill patient, treatment of a presumed hypersensitivity reaction is necessary while considering other etiologies and treatments. None of the additional therapies work immediately, thus prophylactic intubation or cricothyrotomy should be performed when edema is progressi ve and there is evidence of airway compromise. Discontinuation of ACE inhibitors leads to resolution within 24-48 hours. Fresh-frozen plasma or purified C1 inhibitor concentrate may be administered for suspected bradykinin mediated causes; however, improvement does not occur for 2-4 hours. Both agents replace the enzyme, kininase II, which breaks down excess bradykinin. DISPOSITION .... Admission Patients with systemic symptoms or potential airway compromise that does not resolve must be hospitalized in an intensive care setting . .... Discharge Patients with resolution of symptoms may be discharged after several hours of ED observation. Refer the patient to an allergist or immunologist. Prescribe antihistam ines and steroids for 3-5 days, and if the reaction was severe, prescribe an epinephrine autoinjector (EpiPen). Patients with known triggers should be advised about strict avoidance of those triggers. Advise patients about per\u00ad sonal identification such as an allergy alert tag.

Rowe BH, Gaeta Emergency Medicine: New York, NY: to Psychiatric Patient Leslie S. Zun, MD Key Points New-onset psychiatric illness requires a comprehensive emergency department work-up. Consider a medical etiology. Prior psychiatric illness with similar presentation does not require an extensive work-up. INTRODUCTION Psychiatric illness is a common presentation to emergency departments (EDs). The number of psychiatric patients presenting to EDs has increased both in total number and in percentage of total ED visits, from 4.9% to 6.3% from 1992-2001. The main ED psychiatric diagnoses are sub\u00ad stance-use disorders (22%), mood disorders (17%), and anxiety-related disorders (16%). Patients with psychiatric illness may have various presentations depending on their underlying psychiatric diagnosis as well as their concurrent medical condition. Psychiatric patients may present with depressed affect, psy\u00ad chosis, agitation, suicidal or homicidal ideation, catatonia, delusions, or dementia. Like other conditions presenting to the ED, the emergency physician must determine whether the patient has a life-threatening condition. The life-threatening conditions include suicidal or homicidal plans and medical condition masquerading as psychiatric illness (Table 98-1). Frequently identified medical causes of abnormal behavior include hypoglycemia, hypoxia, seizures, head trauma, and thyroid abnormalities. Patients should also be assessed for the presence of delirium or dementia, as both have potentially treatable causes. The primary role of the ED physician is to determine whether the psychiatric presentation is due to a medical or psychiatric etiology. Agitated patients need immediate treatment in the emergenc y department. Patients with suicidal and homicidal plans or inability to care for themselves need psychiatric admission. Table 98-1. Medical conditions that masquerade as psychiatric disease. Alcohol intoxication or withdrawal Anticholinergic poisoning Drug intoxication or withdrawal Electrolyte abnormality Head injury Hepatic failure Hyperthyroidism Hypoglycemia Meningitis and encephalitis Renal failure Seizure Stroke Wernicke encephalopathy This determination is often referred to as the medical clearance process. The secondary role of the ED physician is to evaluate the patient's coexisting medical conditions because many of these psychiatric patients have a high incidence of medical illnesses that have been neglected. 426 APPROACH TO THE PSYCHIATRIC PATIENT Some psychiatric patients present to the ED with acute agitation. These patients, like others in the ED, are acutely ill and need to be stabilized before definitive evaluation can be completed. Once the agitation has been reduced, the clinician must determine the cause of the agitation and the need for a psychiatric versus medical admission. CLINICAL PRESENTATION History A detailed history, including prior psychiatric history, is the most important step to determine whether the patient's presentation is due to a medical or psychiatric problem . It is important to determine whether the patient's current presentation is the same or similar to previous psychiatric presentations. Some psychiatric patients can provide a history of their condition, whereas others may require collateral information. History from family, bystanders, paramedics, police officers or medical records can provide valuable information. Medical and psychiatric history, medications, medication compliance, substance use, and recent stressors may provide insight into the patient's presentation. Multiple factors cause a psychiatric patient to decompensa te and present to the ED, including concomitant substance use and withdrawal, noncompl iance with psychotropic medications, change in social situation, and environmental stressors. It is valuable to determine these factors to better address the patients' needs. Physical Examination The physical examination can provide important clues into the etiology of the patient's presentation. The \"red flags\" indicating a possible medical etiology include age over 45 years, bowel or bladder incontinence, cognitive deficit, abnormal vital signs, and abnormal or focal examination (Table 98-2). A psychiatric patient should have a thorough examination in the ED. A head-to-toe examination with focus on a neurologic and mental status examination is essential. The neurologic examination should assess for focal deficits by evaluating cranial nerves, sensation, strength, reflexes, and coordination. Every patient requires a mental status examination that should include Table 98-2. Red flags of medical illness. Age >45 years Bowel or bladder incontinence Focal neurologic examination Cognitive deficit Abnormal vital signs Abnormal or focal physical examination appearance, behavior and attitude, disorders of thought, disorder of perception, mood and affect, insight and judgment, sensorium, and intelligence. Patients also need an evaluation of their cogn itive functioning because many times a deficit cannot be detected in a routine ED examination. Specific tests of cognitive function include the Mini-Mental State Examination, Clock Drawing Test, and the Cognitive Capacity Screening Examination. Patients with a psychiatric etiology for their symptoms usually have normal vital signs, a nonfocal examinati on, and a normal test of cognitive function, whereas patients with medical etiologies may have abnormal vital signs, a focal examinatio n, or an abnormal cognitive deficit. Patients with abnormal level of arousal and cognition may have delirium, whereas patients with normal arousal, but impaired cognition may have dementia. DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES Laboratory Clinical judgment should determine the need for lab testing of patients presenting with psychiatric complaints. Rather than using clinical judgment, some institutions have a set of laboratory tests that are routinely performed on all patients with behavioral complaints. Patients with a first-time presentation of psychiatric illness or a change in the presentation of their psychiatric symptoms should have general laboratory studies (complete blood count [CBC], chemistry panel, urinalysis) performed. A CBC may indi\u00ad cate an infectious process, abnormal chemistries may reveal hypoglycemia or hypo/hypernatremia, and urinaly\u00ad sis may provide evidence of a urinary tract infection. Routine drug screens and alcohol levels are not useful and should be reserved for patients with altered mental status of unknown etiology. Patients with known psychiatric illness and a consistent psychiatric presentation usually do not require testing. Imaging Imaging, like other testing, should be performed based on clinical judgment. A noncontrast head computed tomography scan is appropriate for patients with new symptoms. A chest radiograph is indicated when a patient has evidence of pneumonia or congestive heart failure. Other imaging should be determined by the patient's clinical condition. PROCEDU RES Psychiatric patients are frequently agitated on presentation to the ED and may pose a threat to themselves or the staff. A stepwise progression of procedures is indicated to treat agitation with the goal of avoiding the use of restraints. The first step in treating the agitated patient is the process of de-escalation. The essentials of de-escalation include attempting to calm the patient, meeting their reasonable CHAPTER 98 needs, and lessening environmental stimulati on. The next step to reduce a patient's level of agitation is to medicate them with a benzodiazepine or anti-psychotic medication. These medications include haloperidol intramuscularly [IM] ), 10 mg lorazepam (1-2 mg IM), alone or in combinat ion. The last step is restraining the patient in a supine position with a restraint on each limb. Restrained patients require frequent or continuous observation. MEDICAL DECISION MAKING History and physical examination, including a neurologic and mental status examination, may be sufficient to determine whether the patient has an acute psychiatric illness. However, any abnormality noted from the history and physical exam warrants further evaluation and treatment looking for a medical etiology. Once medical issues have been addressed, patients with ED presentation of psychosis, depression, anxiety, suicidal, or homicidal ideation need an appropriate psychiatric evaluation and disposition. Patients with abnormal behavior from new-onse t delirium, dementia, or other medical illness require further medical evaluation and admission (Figure 98-1). TREATMENT Treatment of the psychiatric patient in the ED varies. The patient may need a refill of their psychotropic medication, initiation of a new psychotropic medication, or emergent treatment for acute agitation. Most emergency physicians do not start patients on new psychotropic medications without psychiatric consultation or primary care commu\u00ad nication. All active medical problems should also be addressed and treated. DISPOSITION Admission There are 3 universally accepted criteria to admit patients with psychiatric illness: homicidal plan, suicidal plan, and the inability to care for oneself. Clinical judgment is often necessary to determine the need for admission in patients with chronic suicidal or homicidal ideation, and patients with other psychiatric illnesses and the potential inability to care for oneself. Discharge Patients discharged from the ED with psychiatric illness need close follow-up by a professional. In many communities there are limited psychiatric resources and professionals to care for these patients. In communities Schizophrenia Bipolar illness Depression Delirium Dementia Hyperthyroidism Head trauma Temporal lobe epilepsy Figure 98-1. Overlapping conditions. with limited psychiatric resources, these patients may be referred to a primary care physician, allied health professionals (nurse practitioner or physician assistant), or community resources (social worker, case manager).
