Indeed, if oil companies doing business in the state maximized use of their equipment, the state could produce more than 12 percent of the nation's oil.1 As a direct con sequence of North Dakota's oil and gas industry, the state's residents have had to contend with some significant air pollution. \"According to EPA's data for 2011, over 2,200 tons of hazardous toxic air pollution \u2014benzene, formaldehyde, and acetaldehyde \u2014were emitted by oil and gas companies in North Dakota.\"2 More than eleven thousand residents live within a half -mile of these operations3\u2014a distance that puts them at an increased risk of health impairments. While formaldehyde and acetaldehyde are certainly toxic, studies have shown a relationship between solvents like benzene, specifically, and fetal impairments.4 The fetal harms that have been linked to benzene and other solvents include neural tube impairments (like spina bifida and anencephaly), eye and ear impairments, and chromosomal anomalies, namely Down syndrome.5 North Dakota has also welcomed hydraulic fracturing, or fracking \u2014an unconventional method of drilling for oil and gas that involves injecting large quantities of pressurized liquid into th e ground. 6 Indeed, because of fracking , North Dakota has become the second -largest producer of crude oil in the U nited States .7 Fracking produces an incredible amount of wastewater.8 One research group \"calculate[d] that in 2018 alone, the fracking boom [in North Dakota] generated 460 million barrels of waste water\u2014 one barrel for each barrel of oil crude produced. That totals 19 billion gallons, or enough waste water to fill the bathtub in every household of North Dakota 623 times.\" 9 Significantly, this wastewater contains an alphabet soup of toxic chemicals \u2014including radioactive 1.

We have had many oil and gas production waste spills, including one of the largest in North Dakota, five miles north of Mandaree \u2014one million gallons of wastewater brine spilled by Crestwood.\" 14 Notably, studies have shown a correlation between the chemicals used and produced in fracking processes and impairments in fetuses. These chemicals include benzene and other solvents \u2014which, as noted above, have been linked to a number of impairments in fetuses \u2014as well as endocrine -disrupting chemicals, which have been associated with congenital heart defects.15 At the same time that North Dakota has w elcomed, and refused to competently regulate, an industry that inundates its residents with chemicals known to injure fetuses, the state has seen fit to pass HB 1305. Signed into law by Governor Jack Dalrymple, HB 1305 provides : Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a physician may not intentionally perform or attempt to perform an abortion with knowledge that the pregnant woman is seeking the abortion solely . . . [b]ecause the unborn child has been diagnosed with either a genetic abnormality or a potential for a genetic abnormality. 16 10. See MALL & T ROUTMAN , supra note 7, at 4, 7. 11.

CODE \u00a7 14-02.1- 04.1(1)(b) (2013 ). 301 2022] THE DYSGENIC STATE The regulation makes it a crime for a physician to perform an abortion under these circumstances.17 In one moment, the government of North Dakota fails to protect its citizens from toxins that impair fetal health. In another moment, that same government compels its citizens to give birth to health -impaired fetuses. This Article identifies these two moments \u2014which are present not just in North Dakota, but rather can be found across the country more broadly \u2014as the dysgenic state. Whereas the eugenic state of the early twentieth century sought to remove impairments from the population, the dysgenic state of t he early twenty- first century seems committed to producing an impaired citizenry. This Article makes two important interventions into the existing literature. First, the Article intervenes simply to identify the dysgenic state \u2014to call out the processes that harm the health of fetuses and then compel pregnant people to carry these pregnancies to term. 18 Second, the Article intervenes to analyze the racial stakes of the dysgenic state. What is the significance of the empirically documented fact that people of color are disproportionately exposed to environmental toxins? What does it mean that because people of color also disproportionately bear the burdens of poverty, they are the least able to avoid the constraints of abortion regulations like HB 1305? What d oes it mean, then, that the state produces impairments not in its citizenry generally, but in its nonwhite citizenry specifically? This is the puzzle that this Article sets out to describe and then analyze. The analysis proceeds in five parts. Part I provi des the context, historical and contemporary, for an investigation of the dysgenic state. It begins with a short history of the eugenics movement in the U nited States , which enlisted the state in its efforts to protect and ensure white racial purity in the early 1900s. It then pivots to the present day, describing studies that have documented that low - income people and people of color are exposed to environmental toxins in their homes, schools, communities, and workplaces more than their affluent and white counterparts. These studies show that race matters, as race is more important than class in predicting whether a community will bear the burdens of pollution. Part II offers a clear articulation of the dysgenic state. It begins by establishing that many en vironmental toxins \u2014to which low -income people and people of color disproportionately are exposed \u2014are known to cause impairments in fetuses. This Part argues that in failing to protect its citizens from 17. Id. \u00a7 14-02.1- 04.1(2). 18. Of course, many processes harm the health of fetuses. For example, researchers have long established that poverty is exceedingly injurious to the fetus. See Charles P. Larson, Poverty During Pregnancy: Its Effects on Child Health Outcomes , 12 PAEDIATRICS & C HILD HEALTH 673, 674- 75 (2007) (documenting the adverse effects that poverty has on the children exposed to it in utero); DARLA BISHOP JACOBS INST. OF WOMEN 'S HEALTH , PREGNANT WOMEN AND SUBSTANCE USE: OVERVIEW OF RESEARCH & P OLICY IN THE UNITED STATES 8, 13 (2017) (providing evidence that poverty causes babies exposed to it in utero to experience negative health outcomes). 302 CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 110: 297 impairment- causing environmental hazards, the state is complicit in creating disability. But then, through disability -selective abortion bans, the state compels pregnant individuals to give birth to health -impaired fetuses. The state's dual role in injuring fetuses, and then forcing individuals to give birth to injured children, is what makes the state dysgenic. Part III then introduces reasons -based abortion bans \u2014regulations that prohibit abortion when a person seeks to terminate a pregnancy for reasons that the legislature has proscribed. After briefly discu ssing race -and sex -selective abortion bans, it introduces disability -selective abortion bans. Part IV then engages in a deeper examination of disability -selective abortion bans. At least part of the reason abortion opponents favor these bans is that they estrange two groups on the political left: disability rights activists and abortion rights activists. Disability rights activists and abortion rights activists have a long and troubled history, which this Part sets out. The Part then goes on to discuss the legality of disability- selective abortion bans, laying out the arguments for and against the laws' constitutionality. The Part next describes how supporters of disability - selective abortion bans have styled them as \"anti -eugenic\"\u2014 a styling that got its most thorough treatment in Justice Clarence Thomas's concurrence in Box v. Planned Parenthood , in which the Court decided to wait until a later day to evaluate the constitutionality of reasons -based abortion bans. Part V concludes the analysis by comparing t he racial politics of the eugenic state of the early twentieth century with the racial politics of the dysgenic state of the early twenty -first century. This Part observes that while the eugenic state (which sought to eliminate disability) and the dysgenic state (which manufactures disability) appear to be polar opposites, they are actually closely aligned. Whereas in the time of eugenics, the state attempted to manufacture white racial purity by removing impairments from the white race, in the time of dysgenics, the state manufactures a \"purity\" among affluent and white people by producing nonwhite and poor communities as the site for impairments. This Part ends by observing another parallel between the eugenic state and the dysgenic state: both contexts af firm the myth of biological race. The myth of biological race proposes that not only are races biologically distinct from one another, but, by virtue of this biological distinction, deficiencies and dysfunctions can be found in some races (i.e., the nonwhi te ones) and not others (i.e., the white race). While the myth of biological race provided the foundational assumption of the eugenics movement, the racial politics of the dysgenic state operate in such a way that they make the myth appear true, functionin g to locate deficiencies and dysfunctions\u2014 that is, impairments \u2014in nonwhite people at birth. A brief conclusion follows. Before beginning, it is valuable to identify three theoretical frameworks that animate the ensuing analysis: critical disability studies , reproductive justice, and environmental justice. 303 2022] THE DYSGENIC STATE The foundational insight of critical disability studies is that disability19 is socially constructed. People with disabilities may have physical, mental, or cognitive characteristics that make it difficult \u2014and, in many cases, impossible \u2014for them to live full, productive, independent lives; however, critical disability studies observes that the difficulties and impossibilities that people with disabilities face are not products of their physical, mental, or cognitive characteristics, but rather a result of the way that we have organized society.20 Critical disability studies proposes a \"social model of disability,\" a paradigm that posits that societal choices are the actual font of the limitations that people with disabilities encounter.21 According to the social model of disability, if the person with paraplegia cannot traverse her physical environment, it is because we have decided to build an environment with stairs, as opposed to ramps that people can navigate with wheelchairs. If the person with clinical depression cannot hold down a job, it is because we have created norms around \"productivity\" and what it means to be a \"good\" employee that render people with mental illnesses unemployable. If we believe t he person with an intellectual disability cannot enjoy a meaningful life, it is due to our constrained definitions of what makes a life \"meaningful.\" Framed in the way the social model of disability proposes, the solution to disability does not involve \"fixing\" the physical, mental, or cognitive characteristics of individuals that place them at a disadvantage 22\u2014a solution that relieves society of responsibility 19. The World Health Organization defines disabi lity as \"an umbrella term for impairments, activity limitations and participation restrictions. \" W ORLD HEALTH ORG., INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF FUNCTIONING , DISABILITY AND HEALTH 8, 10 (2013). As scholars and activists Sujatha Jesudason and Julia Epste in explained, \"This definition covers a range of conditions that have mild to severe impacts on daily life. So mild autism, such as Asperger 's Syndrome, is not definitionally distinct from a fatal condition such as anencephaly, except in degree of severity .\" Sujatha Jesudason & Julia Epstein, The Paradox of Disability in Abortion Debates: Bringing the Pro -Choice and Disability Rights Communities Together , 84 CONTRACEPTION 541, 541 (2011). 20. See Adrienne Asch, Critical Race Theory, Feminism, and Disability: Reflections on Social Justice and Personal Identity , 62 OHIO ST.

REV. 1251, 1252- 53 (2007) (arguing that the social model of disability is of little value because \"[d]eciding how to respond to 'disability ' depends on a normative framework that cannot be supplied by the model \"). 22.

J.L. & G ENDER 425, 436 (2006) [hereinafter Bagenstos, Life, Death ] (\"Disability rights advocates have long argued that the proper remedy for such stigmatization is not medical treatment to eliminate disabilities \u2014and certainly not medical interventions to eliminate peop le with disabilities . . . .\"). 304 CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 110: 297 for the marginalization of people with disabilities.23 Rather, the solution involves reorganizing society so that people with disabilities can fully engage with it and contribute to it.24 One point of contestation within the field of critical disability studies involves the role of medicine.25 Because the institution of medicine has conceptualized disability, or health impairments,26 as something to be avoided, fixed, and eliminated, it tends to think of health -impaired individuals as suffering as a matter of course\u2014 as living a diminished, tortured life.27 This understanding of disability, which conceptualizes people with health impairments as having something wrong with them, has worked to subjugate and oppress people with impairments. As a consequence, scholars, activists, and advocates have been wary of medicine as an institution.28 There has been a sense that people with health impairments ought to reject medicine outright. They ought not to want what medicine has to offer. They ought not to want a cure.29 However, the 23. See Arlene S. Kanter, The Law: What 's Disability Studies Got to Do With It or an Introduction to Disability Legal Studies , 42 COLUM . HUM. RTS. L. REV. 403, 420 (2011) (noting that the medical model of disability, which f rames a person with a disability as ailing and in need of treatment, lets society \"off the hook \" and relieves it of any \"obligation to look at how it, itself, is structured[,] how it creates barriers to inclusion[,] and how it shares in the responsibility to eliminate the legal, attitudinal, and physical barriers that exclude people with disabilities from our schools, workplaces and neighborhoods \"). 24. See Kath leen R. Bogart & Dana S. Dunn , Ableism Special Issue Introduction , 73 J. SOC. ISSUES 650, 652 (2019) (noting that the social model of disability \"places the onus of change on society, rather than the individual or specialists seeking to change the individual \"); Kanter, supra note 23, at 410 (proposing a paradigm that \"aims to 'fix' systems to be accessible to and usable by people with disabilities in contrast to the traditional paradigm that focuses on 'fixing ' the individual so that he or she can better fit into existing systems \"). 25. See generally SAMUEL R. BAGENSTOS , LAW AND THE CONTRADICTIONS OF THE DISABILITY RIGHTS MOVEMENT (2009). 26. While this Article uses \"disabilities\" and \"impairments \" interchangeably, it may be important to note that the social model of disability distinguishes the two. Impairments are the physical, mental, or cognitive characteristics possessed by individuals who deviate from a constructed norm; these impairments become disabilities only when they interact with a hostile social environment. See Diniz et al., supra note 21, at 68 (proposing that disability \"is the negative outcome of the insertion of a body with impairments into social environments that are insensitive to people's physical diversity\"); Kanter, supra note 23, at 426 (distinguishing between an impairment, which is \"the physical fact of lacking an arm or leg, \" and disability, which is \"the social process that turns impairment into a negative by creating barriers to access\" ). 27. See Deckha, supra note 21, at 15 (arguing that the medical model 's understanding of disability \"as an intensely negative experience exaggerates the biological realities of certain human disorders \"); see also Fiona A. K. Campbell, Inciting Legal Fictions : 'Disability 's' Date with Ontology and the Ableist Body of the Law , 10 GRIFFITH L. REV. 42, 43 (2001) (describing a conception of disability that figures it \"as negative ontology, a malignancy, a body constituted by what Michael Oliver terms 'the personal tragedy theory of disability, ' wherein disability cannot be spoken about as anything other than an anathema \"). 28. See Rosemarie Garland -Thomson, Disability Studies: A Field Emerged , 65 AM. Q. 915, 915- 16 (2013) (describing critical disability studies scholars ' repudiation of the idea that disability is \"a medical problem needing a medical solution \"). 29. See ALISON KAFER , FEMINIST , QUEER , CRIP 7 (2013) (describing a political position about disability that \"casts cure out of our imagined futures \" and presents cure as a \"future no self -respecting disability activist or scholar wants \"); see also John Swain & Sally French, Towards an Affirmation Model of Disability , 15 DISABILITY & S OC'Y 569, 573 (2000) (stating that although people without 305 2022] THE DYSGENIC STATE relationship that health -impaired people have with medicine can be, and often is, more nuanced. Some scholars have articulated a middle position that recognizes that impairments are things that can and should be celebrated \u2014a fact that the institution of medicine has denied in its quest to eliminate them30\u2014while, at the same time, acknowledging that impairments can be painful and life -shortening. Consequently, while impairments can create community and represent the marvelous range of human variation, the interventions that medicine offers to address some impairments\u2014 interventions t hat can sometimes alleviate pain and extend life\u2014 can be very much desired and, sometimes, needed. 31 This Article stages its intervention at this middle position. It recognizes disability as worthy of celebration inasmuch as it reflects awe -inspiring variat ions among humans. Simultaneously, it recognizes something brutal about a state that is complicit in producing disability in the citizenry that it is supposed to protect. Moreover, it recognizes something particularly vicious about a state that would produ ce disability such that it is concentrated among already vulnerable and marginalized people. The tension that this Article occupies, then, is its belief that disabilities have value and deserve respect, and its critique of the state for producing the same. 32 The second framework that animates this Article's analysis is reproductive justice (RJ), which emerged in the 1990s as a response to traditional approaches of conceptualizing and protecting reproductive freedom.33 The women of color whose intellectual energies generated the RJ framework observed that most mainstream organizations that were fighting for \"reproductive rights\" at the end disabilities assume that people with disabilities \"want to be 'normal, '\" this sentiment \"is rarely voiced by disabled people themselves who know that disability is a major part of their identity \"). 30. See John F. Muller, Disability, Ambivalence, and the Law , 37 AM. J.L. & M ED. 469, 470 (2011) (\" [A]dherents of the social model tend to cast disability as a difference we should celebrate, and . . . adherents of the medical model tend to cast disability as a difference we should eliminate. \"). 31. See KAFER , supra note 29, at 6 (recognizing \"the possibility of simultaneously de siring to be cured of chronic pain and to be identified and allied with disabled people \"); Nicole Buonocore Porter, Relieving (Most of) the Tension: A Review Essay of Samuel R.

Kafer captured this tension stunningly when she wr ote: As much joy as I find in communities of disabled people, and as much as I value my experiences as a disa bled person, I am not interested in becoming more disabled than I already am. I realize that position is itself marked by an ableist failure of imagination, but I can't deny holding it. Nor am I opposed to prenatal care and public health initiatives aimed at preventing illness and impairment, and futures in which the majority of people continue to lack access to such basic needs are not futures I want. But there is a difference between denying necessary health care, condoning dangerous working conditions, o r ignoring public health concerns (thereby causing illness and impairment) and recognizing illness and disability as part of what makes us human.

REV. 459, 497- 98 (2008). 306 CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 110: 297 of the twentieth century were singularly concerned with protecting the right to an abortion.34 While the founders of RJ understood that the right to terminate an unwanted pregnancy was absolutely essential and well worth fighting tooth and nail for, they also understood that the right to an abortion did not encompass the entire universe of reproductive concerns.35 They believed that the reason most mainstream reproductive rights organizations focused on the abortion right to the exclusion of all of the other constraints, challenges, and coercions that people with the capacity for pregna ncy face was that compelled motherhood\u2014 the consequence of the failure to protect abortion rights \u2014was the primary constraint, challenge, or coercion faced by the wealthier, white, cisgender women who helmed and funded such organizations.36 While poor people and people of color, like their affluent and white counterparts, faced the threat of compelled motherhood, they were also frequently denied the ability to become mothers.37 Additionally, marginalized people were also deprived of the ability to parent the children that they had in humane, dignity -respecting, life- affirming conditions.38 The RJ framework, then, proposes that in order to protect the reproductive freedom of all people with the capacity for pregnancy \u2014and not just those who enjoy race and class privilege\u2014 we need to struggle for the realization of a three - part program: 1) the right not to become a parent; 2) the right to become a parent; and 3) the right to parent one's children with dignity.39 The RJ framework informs this Article inasmuch as it recognizes that it is a manifest injustice to be obliged to give birth to a health -impaired child. Being forced to give birth to a child\u2014 health- impaired or not\u2014 is a clear violation of the RJ tenet that a competent, humane government respects the right not to become a parent. Nevertheless, there is something especially cruel about a government that forces people to give birth to children whose health has been impaired by toxic environments that the state is complicit in creating. This is precisely what the dysgenic state does. The third theoretical framework animating this Article's analysis is environmental justice. 40 The environmental justice movement is a response to 34.

Most observers put the genesis of the environmental justice movement with the protests that were sparked in Warren County, North Carolina in 1982 after the state decided that a poor, predominately black neighborhood would be an appropriate site for a landf ill for soil contaminated by polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) that had been illegally dumped along the side of a road. See Jedediah 307 2022] THE DYSGENIC STATE the insufficiency of the mainstream environmental protection movement, which historically has ignored the concerns of people of color \u2014in part because people of color have been largely absent from mainstream organizations due to the tendency of these organizations to hire white people exclusively. 41 Tellingly, the demographics of the environmental protection movement have not changed significantly since those who incited the development of the environmental justice movement first made their critique. 42 While traditional environmentalism has centered the preservation of wildlife and wilderness,43 environmental justice has expanded the list of pressing environmental issues to include phenomena that more directly affect marginalized people , including occupational hazards, lead Purdy, The Long Environmental Justice Movement , 44 ECOLOGY L.Q. 809, 820 (2018). The protests, which lasted over six weeks, raised national awareness about the environmental burdens with which poor communities of color were disproportionately saddled. See id. A year after the Warren County protests, the Government Accounting Office (GAO) released a study that showed that, even though black people comprised only 20 percent of the population in eight states in the south, 75 percent of the hazardous waste landfills in those states were located in predominately black communities. See ROBERT D. BULLARD , ENVIRONMENT AND MORALITY : CONF RONTING ENVIRONMENTAL RACISM 4 (2001). A few years following the GAO report, the Commission for Racial Justice of the United Church of Christ reported that three out of five people of color lived in a community with a toxic waste facility; further, the rac e of a neighborhood 's residents \u2014and not their class \u2014was the most important characteristic in predicting whether a neighborhood would have a hazardous waste facility. See Regina Austin & Michael Schill, Black, Brown, Poor & Poisoned: Minority Grassroots Env ironmentalism and the Quest for Eco - Justice , 1 K AN. J.L. & PUB. POL'Y 69, 69 (1991). Convening in 1991, the First National People of Color Environmental Leadership Summit congealed the agitation into a movement. See BULLARD , supra , at 5. It was at this mee ting that the focus of environmental justice broadened \"beyond its anti -toxics focus to include issues of public health, worker safety, land use, transportation, housing, resource allocation and community empowerment. \" Id. 41.

This Article reads this concern in light of studies that show that toxins in the places where marginalized people live, work, and play cause health impairments in fetuses. Thus, the state no t only fails to protect marginalized people from toxic environments, but it forces them to give birth to children that bear the marks of those toxic environments. This is the cruelty that motivates this Article's analysis. One additional note before beginn ing: although this Article might be described as putting reproductive justice and environmental justice in conversation with one another, this description may misrepresent the two frameworks. That is, reproductive justice fits under its umbrella of concern s everything that impacts an individual's ability to become a parent, to avoid parenthood, and to parent the children that she has with dignity. Because environmental degradation impacts a person's ability to become a parent (inasmuch as toxins cause infer tility, miscarriages, and stillbirths 46), environmental justice is already included within the ambit of the reproductive justice framework. This is to say that environmental justice does not need to be put \"in conversation with\" reproductive justice: it is already a part of the framework. 47 Similarly, because environmental justice is concerned not only with the fact that subordinated people disproportionately bear the burdens of environmental degradation, but also the range of harms that this environmental degradation inflicts on subordinated peoples\u2014 including reproductive harms \u2014 reproductive justice is already included within the ambit of the environmental justice framework.48 44.

RACIAL DISENFRANCHISEMENT : PAST AND PRESENT This Part provides an overview of t wo forms that racial disenfranchisement has taken\u2014 both of which are relevant to an analysis of the dysgenic state. The first is the fact of the eugenics movement, which endeavored to purify and perfect the white race at the turn of the twentieth century. The second is the fact that, currently, people of color disproportionately bear the burdens of environmental harms. A. A Short History of Eugenics Eugenics, which originated in Europe in the late nineteenth century before making its way to the United States sh ortly thereafter, is a pseudoscience that proposes that society can be improved through the purposeful elimination of problematic genes and the purposeful proliferation of desirable genes. 49 Eugenics puts the Social Darwinist credo that the strong will sur vive in conversation with genetic determinism.50 The basic assumption behind eugenics is that the nation's social hierarchy simply reflects the genes of those within the various strata of the hierarchy.51 Accordingly, those who are succeeding within societ y\u2014the wealthy, the powerful \u2014occupy their social stations because their superior genes have led to their inexorable triumph. Conversely, the inferior genes of those who are not wealthy and powerful have led them, inevitably, to their subordinated place in s ociety. According to eugenicists, the existential threat to the nation \u2014and the globe\u2014 was the overtaking of good genes by bad genes.52 According to eugenics, if the U nited States enjoyed wealth and global power, it was due to the simple fact that good genes predominated in the body politic.53 If bad genes multiplied https://www.greenpeace.org/usa/envirojusticexreprojustice / [https://perma.cc/X9ZT -ZAE3 ] (\"Environmental justice demands self -determination for individuals and all communities which includes the right to live in a safe environment needed to raise children. \"). 49.

First, they sought the passage of anti -miscegenation laws, which would prevent white people's racially advantageous genes from mixing with nonwhite people's racially benighted gen es. 65 Second, they pursued immigration reform with the aim of reducing immigration from countries with bad genes.66 To be precise, eugenicists successfully sought to reduce the number of immigrants who eugenicists considered to be only marginally white.67 And third, eugenicists pursued a program of coerced sterilization, which, they asserted, would prevent the proliferation of the problematic genes that were already inside of the nation's borders.68 The plan was to prevent people with undesirable genes from having children so that their genes would not persist beyond their holders' lifetimes. The legality of forced sterilization was uncertain until the Virginia State Colony for Epileptics and Feebleminded designed a case that would pose the question of whether the practice was consistent with the Constitution.69 The Supreme Court ultimately answered that question in the affirmative in Buck v. Bell, asserting that the government could force an institutionalized individual to submit to a sterilization procedure without running afoul of any constitutional 63. See Paul A.

The principle that sustains compulsory vaccination is broad enough to cover cutting the Fallopian tubes. Three generations of imbeciles are enough.71 After the Court gave its imprimatur to forced sterilization, states rapidly passed their own eugenic sterilization laws.72 Ultimately, over thirty states passed such legislation,73 and tens of thousands of individuals fell victim to the eugenicists' knife between 1900 and the 1940s.74 The eugenics movement in the U nited States \u2014which became powerful enough to influence other countries, including Germany75\u2014was incredibly popular during its heyday, counting as subscribers powerful public figures76 as 70. 274 U.S. 200 (1927). Importantly, while forced sterilization laws discriminated against people with disabilities, who were targeted by these laws, they also discriminated against poor people. This is b ecause the laws only provided for the forced sterilization of people who had been institutionalized. Poor people with disabilities were more likely than their affluent counterparts to be cared for in institutions than in private homes or private facilities . See Kevles, supra note 62, at 436 (\"Almost everywhere they were passed, . . . the laws reached only as far as the inmates of state institutions for the mentally h andicapped or mentally ill.

It wa s ableist in that it considered disability, broadly construed, to be exceedingly unwanted. The best way to deal with disability, according to eugenicists, was to prevent the existence of people with disabilities. Eugenics was profoundly classist in that it was willing to run roughshod over impoverished people's rights to prevent them from perpetuating their imagined poverty- causing genes. Moreover, it individualized the causes of poverty \u2014seeing poverty's origins not in the way that we have organized our economy nor in the design of our institutions, but rather in the poor person's genes. 80 Indeed, eugenics represented a \"biologizing of poverty,\" finding poverty's source (as well as its solution) in individuals' biology. Finally, eugenics was profoundly racis t because it proposed that all the people in that preciously small population that was in possession of desirable genes were white. To be clear, eugenics did not claim that all white people had desirable genes. Again, it was deeply classist (i.e., it excluded poor white people) and ableist (i.e., it excluded white people with disabilities). Indeed, the universe of white people with good genes, as imagined by eugenicists, excluded many (if not most) white people. Nevertheless, eugenics was a racist pseudosci ence and movement because if one was nonwhite, one was disqualified from being included in the blessed society of those with desirable genes. The only people with desirable genes were white. As eugenics biologized poverty, it biologized race. (Indeed, euge nics assumed that all forms of difference were biologically determined \u2014explaining class differences, differences in the embrace of social norms, and differences in ability.) This is to say that racial differences were explained in terms of biology . 77. See Malinowski, supra note 72, at 135 (noting th at the Carnegie Institute of Washington donated $10 million to eugenics research and that at the time, this amount \"surpassed the total endowment for research in United States universities \"). 78. See id. at 145 (describing Nazi Germany 's progression through a eugenics -informed agenda that began with coerced sterilization, moved on to euthanasia of the mentally ill and cognitively impaired, and culminated in \"'racial purification ' via genocide\" of Jewish people); Katz, supra note 50, at 2 (stating that the \"rise of the Nazis \" functioned \"to drive eugenics into eclipse and disrepute \"); Kevles, supra note 62, at 438 (\" The revelations of the holocaust strengthened the moral objections to eugenics . . . .\"). 79. See Katz, supra note 50, at 2 (stating that the \"more research revealed about the complexity of human genetics, the less defensible even reform genetics appeared \"); Kevles, supra note 62, at 437 (stating that geneticists eventually showed that \"many mental disabilities have nothing to do with genes; that those which do are not simple products of genetic make up [sic]\" and that \"most human behaviours (including deviant ones) are shaped by environment at least as much as by biological heredity, if they are fashioned by genes at all \"). 80. See Kevles, supra note 62, at 435 (explaining that eugenics \"attributed poverty . . . to bad genes rather than to flaws in the social corpus \"). 314 CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 110: 297 Thus, eugenics proposed that the white race was biological ly distinct from nonwhite races. Moreover, eugenics also proposed the hierarchical ordering of the races, with the white race enjoying a biologically determined superiority over all other races. It is important to underscore that the overriding goal of the eugenics movement was white racial improvement.81 It sought to rid the white race of all of the things that kept it from attaining the greatness that was its racial destiny. Thus, the eugenics movement en deavored to cleanse the white population in the United States of nonwhiteness (through anti -miscegenation laws), marginal whiteness (through immigration reform), physical and mental impairments (though forced sterilization of institutionalized persons), an d poverty (through the eventual overwhelming of poor white people's poverty -causing genes by affluent white people's poverty -resistant genes). This is to say that the eugenics movement sought to produce the white population as pathology -free. If pathology was to exist in the United States , it was to be found among nonwhite people and, until the ultimate triumph of affluent white people's poverty - resistant genes, poor white people. Eugenics sought to achieve this white racial purity through removing pathology from the white race. B. Environmental Injustice, or the (Environmental) Burdens of Being Poor and Nonwhite The communities in which poor people and people of color live are more polluted than the communities that their affluent and white counterparts call home. 82 The range of environmental harms that disproportionately impact marginalized people is truly vast \u2014almost comprehensive.83 Studies have documented that poor people and people of color are more frequently exposed 81. See Alexandra Minna Stern, Making Better Babies: Public Health and Race Betterment in Indiana, 1920 -1935, 92 AM. J. PUB. HEALTH 742 (2002) (exploring eugenicists ' understanding of the role of public health, positive eugenics, and racial hygiene in white racial improvement). 82. See Luke W.

L. & POL'Y 4, 4 (2012- 2013) (noting that the \"vast majority \" of studies \"have shown a trend toward low -income communities and especially communities of color being unfairly burdened with excessive pollution from a varie ty of polluting industries and chemical exposures \"). 83. See Cole, supra note 82, at 622 (explaining that the claim that \"the poor suffer disproportionately from environmental hazards . . . is confirmed in local and national studies of the impacts of toxics production and disposal, garbage dumps, air pollution, lead poisoning, pesticides, occupational hazards, noise pollution and rat bites \"). 315 2022] THE DYSGENIC STATE to lead in their housing and neighborh oods.84 Low-income people and people of color are much more likely to live in neighborhoods with poor air quality.85 The neighborhoods that poor people and people of color call home are more likely to be proximate to hazardous sites, incinerators, polluting factories, and brownfields.86 The water that poor people and people of color use for drinking, washing their food, cleaning their clothes, and bathing and showering is more likely to be tainted with harmful chemicals.87 These are incontrovertible truths. Perhaps we might more easily forgive the excessive pollution found in poor communities and communities of color if these communities were reaping the benefits of the industries that were polluting them. If oil refineries, for example, created jobs for the people in the communities that were on the receiving end of their toxin -generating processes, then we might feel that communities have traded a cost (i.e., their health) for a benefit (i.e., employment). However, all too frequently, industrial facilities do not employ people from the communities in which they are located. As environmental justice pioneer Robert Bullard explained: There is little or no correlation between proximity of industrial plants in communities of colour and employment opportunities o f nearby residents. Having industrial facilities in one's community does not automatically translate into jobs for nearby residents . . . . More often than not, communities of colour are stuck with the pollution and poverty, while other people commute in for the industrial jobs. 88 84.

To be precise, the jobs that people of color more frequently perform \u2014farmworker, nail technician, sanitation worker, etc. \u2014requir e that they come into contact with harmful substances.90 The result is that numerous substances from numerous arenas compromise marginalized people's health.

Many people might assume that the excessive exposure to environmental harms that people of color face is solely a function of the disproportionate poverty that they bear. However, this is not true. Even when one controls for class, people of color are more likely to be exposed to environmental harms in their communities .92 As environmental justice lawyer Mike Ewall helpfully 89.

No amount of ventilation will solve the problem; harmful chemicals themselves need to be eliminated or made unprofitable.\"104 Why exactly have low -income people and people of color come to bear the brunt of environmental injustices? There are several answers to this question. At times, polluting industries seek to site themselves specifically in low - income communities.105 Poor communities might be particularly attractive because their land is cheap and their population is sparse.106 Moreover, decision makers at corporations likely understand that the poverty in a low -income 98.

See Austin & Schill, supra note 40, at 70 (explaining that areas with low population density are attractive to companies looking for a site for their facilities and that \"a sparse concentration of inhabitants is correlated with poverty which is in turn correlated with race \"); Cole, supra note 82, at 628 (noting that \"industry 's tendency to seek inexpensive land \" is a factor that contribut es to poor communities and communities of color bearing disproportionate numbers of environmental hazards). 319 2022] THE DYSGENIC STATE community renders the people bereft of the political power that they need to fight siting decisions.107 Thus, it might be cheaper and easier for corporations to target low-income communities for undesirable facilities. Once a dirty facility invades a low -income community, the people who live there, because they are poor, often lack the ability to move to a less polluted place.108 In essence, their poverty renders them immobile. Further still, when the people in these communities are nonwhite, race may leave them immobile as well. The same race -based constraints that make it difficult for people of color to escape segregated neighborhoods of color make it difficult for people of color to escape polluted neighborhoods.109 Even when corporations do not specifically target marginalized communities for environmentally hazardous facilities, these facilities may nevertheless end up in these communities because of subordinated people's relative lack of political power.110 If a company attempts to site a pollution - generating facility in a more affluent community, that community is more likely to have the political wherewithal to defeat the company's plans. While the Not - In-My-Backyard (NIMBY) impulse might be universally shared \u2014indeed, no community may want a toxin -producing facility sited close by\u2014 the community with the least political power will be the community that is unable to make decision makers respect their NIMBY desires.111 These politically powerless communities are often poor and populated with people of color.112 107. See Godsil, supra note 105, at 399 (describing the po ssibility that poor communities and communities of color might be targeted for polluting facilities \"because their residents are more likely to be poor and politically powerless \" and that \"[w]aste -management firms, therefore, find it politically expedient to site hazardous waste facilities in minority communities \"). 108. See Cole, supra note 82, at 630 ( \"Poor people and people of color . . . have the least mobility, both in terms of employment and residence, and thus, even in the face of toxic exposure, they usually cannot find new jobs or homes. \"). 109. See BULLARD , supra note 40, at 20 -21 (\"The ability of an individual to escape a health - threatening physical environment is often related to affluence, but racial and ethnic barriers further complicate this process. . . .

See Cole, supra note 82, at 628 (explaining that \"poor peoples ' lack of political and economic power in resisting \" corporations that seek to site polluting facilities in poor people 's neighborhoods contributes to the disproportionate number of environmental harms found in the se neighborhoods). 111. Foster explain ed the process as follows: The NIMBY syndrome consists of public opposition from more vocal, and politically powerful, middle and upper income communities to the siting of a toxic facility, or other \"Locally Unwanted Land Use\" (LULU) in their neighborhoods. As more affluent communities become increasingly vocal in their opposition, calling for the facilities to be sited 'somewhere else, ' private industries have shifted their siting efforts toward other communi ties. [\" Somewhere else \"] often ends up being . . . poor, powerless, minority communities. Foster, supra note 82, at 728 . 112. See id. (explaining that \"[s]ince '[m]inority communities do not have the resources, or [government and industry] contacts, to initiate or sustain the proactive behavior found in more affluent communities, ' toxic facilities and other environmental hazards end up in those communities \" (alterations in original)). 320 CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 110: 297 Political powerlessness also explains why marginalized communities are often zoned in ways that ensure that polluting facilities will be sited there and not in the more affluent community across the train tracks. Zoning decisions are profoundly local and profoundly political.113 Local government bodies have power to decide which areas will be zoned for residential uses and green spaces and which areas will be \"zoned for garbage.\" 114 People marginalized by race and class are oftentimes unable to influence the zoning boards that ultimately decide whether their communities will be spared from , or inundated with, pollution.115 Further, zoning also explains why polluted com munities are often the sites of multiple types of pollutants. This is the principle of \"pollution attracting pollution.\"116 Once an area is marked for industrial use, it opens the door for all industries to set up shop. The result is that the people living in these areas oftentimes get exposed to a true cornucopia of hazards. Studies also show that environmental laws are more likely to go unenforced in poor neighborhoods of color.117 One study conducted in the early 1990s examined over one thousand Superfund sites and concluded that \"penalties under hazardous waste laws assessed at sites having the greatest white population were about 500 percent higher than penalties at sites with the greatest minority population.\" 118 It also calculated that for \"all the feder al environmental laws aimed at protecting citizens from air, water and waste pollution, penalties in 113.

Perhaps one of the most extreme examples of pollution attracting pollution is the case of Chester, Pennsylvania: The mostly African -American City of Chester, Pennsylvania is home to the nation 's largest trash incinerator, a sewage treatment plant that burns the county 's sewage sludge, a paper mill that burns waste coal, numerous chemical plants and toxic waste sites, and formerly hosted the nation' s largest medical waste autoclave. It is surrounded on either side by oil refineries and coal, oil and gas -fired power plants. Ewall, supra note 82, at 6. Chester became the subject of litigation after residents sued the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection for approving the construction of a facility that would burn soil that had been contaminated with oil. See id. \"This 'soil burner ' facility would have been sandwiched between the trash and sewage sludge incinerators.\" Id. 117.

REV. 1, 6 (2002). 321 2022] THE DYSGENIC STATE white communities were 46 percent higher than in minority communities.\"119 Inadequate enforcement of environmental laws in the neighborhoods in which subordinated people live undoubtedly contributes to the excessive pollution found there. Yet another explanation for the disproportionate siting of hazardous facilities in marginalized communities is that the vulnerable people in these communities might agree to host the facility because they hope that it will bring jobs. 120 Indeed, corporations may \"environmentally blackmail\" them, promising them jobs in exchange for their toleration of an undesirable facility.121 But these hopes all too often go unfulfilled.122 Still another explanation for the disproportionate siting of hazardous facilities in marginalized communities is that, at times, marginalized people come to the polluter. That is, an undesirable facility may be sited in an area where, at least initially, mor e privileged people live.123 However, people who are unprivileged along the lines of class or race may gravitate to the area because the area's undesirability \u2014an undesirability that frequently is a direct result of the facility and the pollution that it gen erates\u2014 has made it affordable to live there.124 As legal scholars Regina Austin and Michael Schill explain ed, \"In some cases, the residential communities where poor minorities live were originally the homes of whites who worked in the facilities that genera te toxic emissions . . . . Whites vacated the housing (but not necessarily the jobs) for better shelter as their socioeconomic status improved, and poorer black and brown folk who enjoy much less residential mobility took their place.\" 125 Because unprivilege d people sometimes come to polluters, some observers claim that disproportionate placement of hazardous facilities in communities of color is not an instance of \"environmental racism.\"126 For example, one scholar has proposed that when poor communities of color form around a polluter that 119.

See Austin & Schill, supra note 40, at 70 ( \"Poor minority citizens are traditionally more likely than others to tolerate pollution generating commercial development in the hope that economic benefits will inure to the community in the form of jobs, increased taxes, and civic improvements. \"); Foster, supra note 82, at 728 (explaining that poor communities of color sometimes believe that \"the existence of noxious facilities and other hazards in minority communities constitutes an economic tradeoff for having jobs near 'poverty pockets'\"). 121.

See BULLARD , supra note 40, at 21 ( \"Having industrial facilities in one 's community does not automatically translate into jobs for nearby residents. Many industrial plants are located within walking distance of the comm unities.

The logical conclusion of this assumption is that racism is only in operation if polluters have targeted poor communities of color because they are poor communities of color. According to this understanding, race -neutral processes that have a disparate harmful impact on people of color, like \"market forces,\" would be improperly identified as \"racism.\" Progressive activists and scholars, many of whom would identify with the environmental justice movement, reject this analysis. First, many reject the claim that the disproportionate siting of hazardous facilities in poor communities of color is largely a result of these communities having come to the polluter. As Bullard argue d: The \"chicken or egg\" waste facility siting debate has nearly been put to rest because recent evidence shows disproportionately high percentages of minorities and low income populations were present at the time the commercial hazardous waste facilities were sited. Hundreds of empirical studies have found race and class disparities in the location of polluting facilities. It has been found over a 30 -year period polluting facilities were deliberately sited in existing minority communities i n the Los Angeles Basin rather than caused by geographic shifts in minority populations. Likewise in Michigan during the last 30 years, commercial hazardous waste facilities were sited in neighborhoods that were disproportionately poor and disproportionate ly nonwhite at the time of siting. 128 Second, many observers believe that they are right to identify the phenomenon of poor communities of color coming to the polluter as racism . These observers reject th e claim that it is not racism when poor communities form around a polluter because the claim relies upon a narrow, politically - motivated definition of racism that would reduce the universe of racist acts to those perpetrated by individual, animus -filled actors who have an intent to 127. See Vicki Been, Locally Undesirable Land Uses in Minority Neighborhoods: Disproportionate Siting or Market Dynamics ?, 103 YALE L.J. 1383, 1388- 90 (1994). 128. Bullard et al., supra note 85, at 29. Defenders of the status quo would likely argue that even if a poor community of color was located in an area prior to a siting decision, the decision is not racist unless it was motivated by animus. If we followed this account, likely no siting decision is racist. The people making those decisions very rarely identify hate of the race of the people in the surrounding community as the motivation behind the decision. Instead, the reasons that decision makers often give for locating a facility in an area populated by poor people of color include \"low-cost land, sparse populations, and desirable geological attributes. \" Foster, supra note 82, at 729. Nevertheless, progressive scholars and activists are comfortable in concluding that these decisions are racist: they harm nonwhite people, who have been historically disadvantaged on account of race, after all. As Foster explain ed, \"In pointing to siting decisions as evidence of 'racism,' environmental justice advocate s have begun to draw a connection between such race-neutral factors and their racial impl ications. \" See id. 323 2022] THE DYSGENIC STATE harm.129 A broader definiti on of racism proposes that we do not err when we understand as racism those acts that may be race -neutral, but that nevertheless (and often predictably) have the effect of disadvantaging people of color.130 \"The market\" very well may push poor people to are as surrounding toxic waste sites. Further, because people of color have higher rates of poverty than their nonwhite counterparts, people of color may come to inhabit the areas surrounding toxic waste sites more frequently than their nonwhite counterparts. Be that as it may, the broader definition of racism that progressive -minded thinkers accept counsels that we are not wrong to identify as racist the fact that people of color disproportionately bear the burdens of poverty. We, as a country, have embraced laws and policies\u2014 including the nation's decision to fund public schools through property taxes, 131 the nation's choice to deploy the criminal legal system and incarceration as the means for attempting to address every perceived social problem that it encounters,132 the nation's production of a population of undocumented (and, consequently, exploitable) laborers through its immigration laws,133 and many, many others \u2014that result in the disproportionate impoverishment of people of color. Simply saying that \"market forces\" are to blame for nonwhite people's disproportionate residence near toxic facilities elides the race- informed \u2014and yes, racist \u2014processes that have interacted to produce that very result.134 Ultimately, this Article's claim does not hinge on whether it is proper to call racist the disproportionate environmental harms that people encounter in their homes, neighborhoods, schools, and workplaces. It is enough to simply observe that this fact is undeniably true. The next Part introduces research that shows that many toxins that the state has permitted to be released into the environment \u2014pollutants to which people of color are disproportionately exposed \u2014are known to harm fetuses.

THE DYSGENIC STATE : READING ENVIRONMENTAL INJUSTICE AND DISABILITY -SELECTIVE ABORTION BANS TOGETHER A. Environmental Injustices and Reproductive Harms If we approach reproductive issues through an environmental justice frame\u2014 and if we approach environmental issues through a reproductive justice lens\u2014we see that because marginalized communities disproportionately bear environmental burdens, the peo ple in these communities more frequently suffer reproductive harms that more affluent people living in less polluted areas can and do avoid. The toxins found in pollution cause a range of reproductive harms, including reproductive cancers (e.g., cancers of the cervix, ovary, uterus, breast, prostate, and testes ), miscarriages, infertility, low birth weight, preterm birth, and infant mortality. 135 While these are devastating harms, they are not the immediate concern of this Article. Instead, this Article is s pecifically concerned with the relationship between pollution and fetal impairments . Now, although the science is far from unequivocal, it is safe to conclude that the toxins found in pollution can injure fetuses. There are several constraints that have ma de it difficult to determine with certainty the effects that environmental toxins have on fetal health. The most important constraint is that it is impossible to construct an experiment that could clearly establish a causal relationship between a particula r pollutant and a particular fetal impairment. Such an experiment would involve exposing a group of pregnant people to a toxin and comparing the health of their infants with the infants birthed by a control group who was not exposed. That investigators would conduct such an experiment is, thankfully, unimaginable in light of present 135.

Another limitation on efforts t o investigate the relationship between environmental toxins and fetal impairments is that due to the nature of observational studies, it is impossible to isolate confounding factors.140 Importantly, poverty may be a confounding factor, as poverty both deter mines whether an individual will live close to or work at a polluting facility as well as contributes to impairments in fetuses and children. 141 Yet another, more heartbreaking, limitation on studies seeking to establish the effects that environmental toxin s have on fetal health is that it seems clear 136.

Interestingly, while there is usually a positive association between poverty and fetal impairment, there is a negative association between the two in the case of Down syndrome. This is because advanced maternal age increases the likelihood that a fetus will have Down syndrome, and more affluent people tend to become pregnant at older ages. See Dolk & Vrijheid, supra note 4, at 30. 326 CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 110: 297 that environmental toxins often produce fetal death as opposed to fetal impairment.142 There have been a number of studies that show a negative association between toxic exposures and congenital anomalies.143 The conclusion that researchers have drawn is not that toxins reduce the number of children born with congenital anomalies because toxins are good for fetuses, but rather that toxins reduce the number of children born with congenital anomalies because affected pregnancies more frequently end in miscarriage. Though observational studies come with important limitations, the scientific literature offers sufficient evidence that a number of environmental toxins produce fetal impairments. -Lead , which can be found in the paint of older homes, in the soil close to older roads, and in the air surrounding facilities engaging in smelting or recycling144\u2014is known to cause impairments in fetuses (as well as children).145 Questions remain about the exact degree of likelihood that a child will be born with an impairment if she is exposed to lead prenatally.146 But, there is little doubt that lead is a toxin that is harmful to fetuses. The impairments produced by prenatal exposure to lead include heart defects, oral clefts, and disorders involving the body's muscles and skeleton. 147 -Mercury, which is emitted in to the air when fossil fuels and wastes are burned and persists in the environment for extremely long periods of time by cycling between air and soil, is also well known to cause impairments in fetuses.148 Pregnant people who are exposed to high levels of m ercury have given birth to children with cerebral palsy, cognitive disabilities, and microcephaly.149 -Nitrates, which enter the soil through fertilizers and animal manure and can contaminate water, are suspected to increase the risks of neural tube impairments (which affect the brain, spine, and spinal cord and include 142.

One study showed that \"[p]regnant women living in areas with higher levels of ozone and carbon monoxide pollution were as much as three times more likely to have had babies with serious birth defects, and the greater a mother's exposure to these pollutants in the critical second month of pregnancy, the greater the chance that the baby would have a serious cardiac defect.\" 155 Anoth er study found an association between traffic pollution and fetal impairments involving the brain, spine, and spinal cord. 156 The study showed that \"women who breathed the highest levels of carbon monoxide were nearly twice as likely to have a baby with spina bifida or anencephaly as those with the lowest carbon monoxide exposure . . . .

B. Particular Dysgenic Offenders This Article proposes that the dysgenic state is a state that compels its citizens to give birth to children whose health has been impaired by environmental toxins from which the state has not protected them. 166 Thus, in order for a state to be dysgenic, it must not only compel the birth of health - impaired infants, but it must also be the site of environmental harms that the state has not seen fit to prevent or correct. It would be quite remarkable if the states that have passed disability - selective abortion bans were free from environmental hazards that cause fetal impairments. But this is not at all true. Indeed, not only do the states that have passed disability- selective abortion bans feature these toxic banalities, but many are also the sites of more spectacular forms of environmental degradation. Consider Indiana, whose disability -selective abortion ban provided Justice Thomas with the opportunity to wax philosophically about eugenics in Box v. Planned Parenthood , discussed below.167 The state has over 6,600 oil and gas facilities, with almost eighty thousand people living within a half -mile of the facilities \u2014a range that puts them at risk of harm from oil and gas pollution.168 Indiana is also the home of a disproportionate number of Superfund sites,169 which are \"contaminated sites [that] exist nationally due t o hazardous waste being dumped, left out in the open, or otherwise improperly managed.\"170 Further still, investigators have documented widespread lead poisoning of children in South Bend, Indiana \u2014more expansive and severe lead poisoning than that found in Flint, Michigan after the crisis in that city unfolded.171 Cuts to 166. This Article proposes that the state is responsible for fetal impairment through its failure to prevent health -impairing pollutants from entering the environment and harming its citizens. Of course, the state is also responsible for fetal impairment when it is the party that exposes its citizens to health - impairing pollutants in the first instance, as is th e case of lead poisoning in Flint, Michigan.

One can most assuredly find l andfills, incinerators, highways, agriculture, industry, processing plants, and hazardous waste facilities in these places. This is the dysgenic state. Moreover, there is no reason to think that the states that have decided or will decide to pass disability -selective abortion bans are exceptions to the general rule that poor people and people of color disproportionately bear environmental burdens. In these states, and all others, poor people and people of color live close to highways. Poor people and people of color work on the farms and are exposed to pesticides. Poor people and people of color have their homes within spitting distance of hazardous waste facilities, factories, and landfills. And while poor people and people of color are most exposed to the toxins that are known to cause fetal impairments, poor people and people of color will find it hardest to avoid the constraints imposed by disability -selective abortion bans. These are the racial and class politics of the dysgenic state, upon which Part V e laborates most expansively. Before getting to that analysis, however, the next two Parts introduce reproductive policy into the analysis, describing states' recent attempts to police people's reasons for terminating a pregnancy. III. R EASONS -BASED ABORTION BANS This Part describes the latest effort in the battle to diminish \u2014and ultimately overturn\u2014 the constitutional right to abortion: reasons -based abortion bans. The first Section describes regulations that aim to prohibit persons from terminating a pregnancy on account of the fetus's race or sex. The following Section describes regulations that aim to prohibit persons f rom terminating a pregnancy on account of an unwanted fetal diagnosis. A. Race -and Sex- Selective Abortion Bans The first iterations of reasons -based abortion bans endeavored to prevent abortions that were sought because of the fetus's sex or race. Fourteen states have passed sex- selective abortion bans, with eleven of these policies in effect,190 while six states have passed race- selective aborti on bans, with four of these policies in effect.191 Although legislation often couples prohibitions on sex - 190. See Guttmacher Inst. , Abortion Bans , supra note 178. Pennsylvania passed one of the firs t sex-selective abortion bans in 1982. See Jennifer Chou & Shivana Jorawar, Silently Under Attack: AAPI Women and Sex-Selective Abortion Bans, 22 ASIAN AM. L.J. 105, 107- 08 (2015). The state 's abortion regulations were challenged in the litigation that cul minated in Planned Parenthood v. Casey . 505 U.S. 833 (1992). Interestingly, litigators chose not to test the constitutionality of the state 's ban on sex - selective abortion. See Box v. Planned Parenthood of Ind. & Ky., Inc., 139 S. Ct. 1780, 1792 (2019) (Thomas, J., Bans , supra note 178. 333 2022] THE DYSGENIC STATE selective abortions with prohibitions on race -selective abortions,192 the behavior that the legislation seeks to regulate in the context of sex and race is not perfectly analogous. Sex -selective abortions endeavor to prevent pregnant people from terminating their pregnancies because the fetus that they carry would be assigned female at birth;193 meanwhile, race- selective abortions endeavor to prevent abort ion providers and other third parties from seeking to terminate the pregnancies of black people because they are black people who are presumably carrying black children.194 Legislators who have proposed and voiced support for race -selective abortion bans us ually claim that they are motivated by black people's disproportionate receipt of abortion care.195 While black women comprise 12.9 percent of women nationwide, they constitute 38 percent of women who receive abortions.196 Commentators with more critical lenses have explained that black women's disproportionate reliance on abortion care is due to their higher rate of unintended pregnancies . 197 Moreover, black people with the capacity for pregnancy have higher rates of unintended pregnancies because they more frequently encounter constraints that make it extremely difficult to fully control their reproductive lives, e.g., poverty, sexual violence, inaccessibility of reliable contraception, lack of sex education in public schoo ls.198 Because black people 192. While an increasing number of states are coupling race -and sex-selective abortion bans with disability -selective abortion bans, some states have made exceptions to sex -selective abortion bans that reveal legislators ' beliefs that although it is unacceptable to terminate a pregnancy because the fetus would be assigned female at birth , it is perfectly acceptable to terminate a pregnancy because the fetus has a disability.

Supporters of reasons -based abortion bans assert that a decision upholding the constitutionality of these laws would not represent a narrowing of Roe because Roe, and the Court' s subsequent abortion cases, did not at all speak to the permissibility of laws that ban abortions on account of the reasons behind the abortion decision. See discuss ion infra note 319. 218. See Ziegler, Roe's Race , supra note 201, at 44 (stating that the reasons -based abortion ban in Arizona and the federal bill that would ban race- and sex- selective abortions \"would require abortion providers to interrogate women about their reasons for choosing an abortion \"). Indeed, Oklahoma 's law requires abortion providers to ask their patients their reasons for undergoing an abortion and to document the answer on an official form. See King, supra note 192, at 28 -29 (noting that providers in Oklahoma are required to send the government an \"Individual Abortion Form \" that \"lists over forty reasons why a woman might seek an abortion and encourages providers to 'check all applicable '\" and stating that these reasons include \"Mother wanted a child of a different sex \" and \"There may be [a] possible problem affecting the health of the fetus \"). 219. See, e.g. , King, supra note 192, at 21 (\"Since Roe, legal scholars and judges have concluded that the Fourteenth Amendment 's Due Process Clause protects a woman 's liberty to decide to have an abortion prior to viability, regardless of her reason. Under this liberty -based approach, constitutional protection attaches to the decision to abort, and a woman 's reason for making the decision is entirely secondary. \"). 220. See Chou & Jorawar, supra note 190, at 115 (arguing that sex -selective abortion bans \"set a dangerous precedent for defining what reasons are or are not acceptable for women seeking an abortion\" ). 221. Of course, since the Court upheld the constitutionality of t he Hyde Amendment in 1980 in Harris v. McRae , indigent women have had to articulate their reasons for seeking an abortion if they hope for their health insurance to cover the cost of the procedure (which, for many indigent women, is the only way for them t o access the procedure). See 448 U.S. 297 (1980) (upholding the Hyde Amendment, which permits the use of federal funds to reimburse the costs of abortions under the Medicaid program only in cases involving rape or incest or when continuation of the pregnan cy will endanger the life of the pregnant person). 222.

Disabilit y-Selective Abortion Bans Fourteen states have passed laws that prohibit abortions that are sought because the child will be born with a disability.225 The bans in five of these states have been temporarily or permanently enjoined.226 Utah's ban \"will only t ake effect if a court decision allows states to ban abortion in these cases.\"227 Meanwhile, Missouri, North Dakota, and Ohio, among other states, have bans that are currently in effect.228 (The Sixth Circuit, sitting en banc, upheld Ohio's ban in April 2021.229) While some of the laws seek to ban abortions only when a fetus has specifically been diagnosed with Down syndrome,230 other laws ban abortions when the fetus has been diagnosed with a disability of any kind.231 224. See Jeannie Suk Gersen, How Fetal Personhood Emerged as the Next Sta ge of the Abortion Wars , NEW YORKER (June 5, Bans , supra note 178. Banning abortion is just one regulatory approach that states have taken with regard to pregnancies involving fetuses that have an impairment of some sort. Th ree states currently require people who have been told that an impairment will cause their child to die shortly after birth to undergo counseling on perinatal hospice services. Id. Other states require persons whose fetus is diagnosed with an impairment to receive information about the condition. Id. However, some abortion rights advocates have been wary of the latter types of regulations, inasmuch as the information that some states require healthcare providers to give is not impartial, but rather designed to convince the pregnant person not to terminate the pregnancy. See ANDERSON , supra note 222, at 31 (\"In recent years, abortion opponents have tried to co -opt thes e 'pro-information ' bills by introducing language that would seek to deter pregnant patients from receiving information about abortion as one of the options following a prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome or another genetic condition.\" ). For example, a Lou isiana law makes it illegal for a health care provider to \"engage in discrimination based on disability or genetic variation by explicitly or implicitly presenting pregnancy termination as a neutral or acceptable option when a prenatal test indicates a probability or diagnosis that the unborn child has Down syndrome or any other health condition. \" L A. STAT. ANN. \u00a7 40:1109.2 (2015). That said, laws that provide prospective parents with information about a health impairment that a prenatal test suggests will likely affect their child once born seem unobjectionable if the information provided is truly impartial.

Studies show that the termination rates following a diagnosis of spina bifida, Turner syndrome, and anencephaly are as high as 67 percent , 75 percent , and 86 percent , respectively.236 Disability -selective abortion bans are interesting for many reasons, one of which is that they represent a reversal of public sentiment about the legitimacy of abortion in cases involving a child who will be born with a health impairment.

As one commentator report ed, \"[i]n 2007, 70% of Americans polled indicated that they believed women should be permitted to obtain an abortion 'if there is a strong chance of a serious defect in the ba by.'

Petersen observe d that some countries ' regulatory schemes make apparent that they consider terminating a pregnancy because a child will (or may) be born with a disability to be a \"good\" reason for undergoing an abortion. She note d that the United Kingdom does not recognize a general right to an abortion, but rather outlines specific circumstances in which having an abortion is not a criminal offense.

These bans codify a polar opposite sense: the discovery that a child will have a disability is a particularly \"bad\" reason for undergoing an abortion.246 While disability- selective abortion bans are like race -and sex -selective abortion bans in that all of these bans police the motivations behind a particular decision to terminate a pregnancy, there are also important differences . While race- and sex -selective abortion bans appear to be a solution in search of a problem \u2014there really is no evidence that anyone is targeting black women for abortions, nor is there evidence that sex -selective abortions are occurring with any frequency in the United States247\u2014the same cannot be said about disability - selective abortion bans.248 It seems patently true that, with some degree of 241.

Critics argue that proponents of these bans are not really interested in protecting people with disabilities. These critics say that if these bans' supporters were genuinely concerned about people with disabilities, they would support measures that are known to improve the quality of the lives of people with disabilities . Such measures include ensuring that people with disabilities can access the healthcare that they need 250 and expanding social safety net programs so that beneficiaries with disabilities are not disincentivized from (or punished for) working outside of the home . 251 They also include increasing funding for programs that allow children with disabilities to obtain adequate educations in public schools, 252 adding the U nited States as a signatory to international treaties that obligate states to protect people with disabilities,253 and sundry other efforts.254 Proponents of disability -selective abortion bans, whose politics tend at 479 (\"The threat to disability rights from disability -selective abortion . . . is arguably greater than the threat to women 's rights from sex -selective abortion; the rate of disability -selective abortion is in a different league. \"). 249.

Disability rights activists and abortion rights activists have a long history of conflict. See discussion supra Part III. 344 CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 110: 297 rights activists historically have sought to generate support for abortion access by deploying the f igure of the disabled child. In this campaign for political support, abortion rights activists have conceptualized babies and children with disabilities as inevitably unwanted and a circumstance to be avoided \u2014a stance that allows abortion rights opponents to position themselves as champions of people with disabilities. This Part then explores the harms of disability -selective abortion before turning to an exploration of the constitutionality of laws that would prohibit the practice, laying out the argument that the established doctrine, as articulated in Planned Parenthood v. Casey , clearly prohibits such regulations. It concludes with a discussion of the framing of disability -selective abortion bans as \"anti- eugenic\"\u2014 a rhetoric that got its highest elevatio n in Justice Clarence Thomas's concurring opinion in Box v. Planned Parenthood . A. Disability and the Problematic History of Abortion Rights Activism As discussed above, many abortion rights activists believe that at least part of the interest that opponents of abortion access have had in disability -selective abortion bans is that the bans represent a fantastic opportunity to create a rift between two groups on the political left \u2014disability rights advocates and abortion rights advocates. 259 Disability rights ac tivists tend to have progressive politics because they believe in a state that actively supports its most vulnerable citizens\u2014 disbelieving that the \"market\" or private actors ought to or will provide the physical and financial assistance that people with disabilities require. 260 At the same time, those who back abortion rights tend to have progressive politics as well, as the political left has generally been home to those who believe that the state ought not to exert reproductive control over its citizens.261 The practice of disability- selective abortion has the potential to create a conflict between the disability rights camp and the abortion rights camp. People in the former camp tend to believe that the practice of disability -selective abortion is incredib ly problematic, premised as it is on the myth that people with disabilities have lives that, objectively speaking, are not worth living. 262 On the other hand , people in the latter camp historically have found the practice of disability -selective abortion mo rally unobjectionable \u2014perhaps even morally right .263 Although 259.

See Pasquale Toscano & Alexis Doyle, Legal Abortion Isn 't the Problem to Be Solved , ATLA Ziegler, Disability Politics , supra note 237, at 595 (noting that abortion rights proponents have \"framed disability -based abortion s as obviously moral and medically necessary \"); 345 2022] THE DYSGENIC STATE abortion rights activists increasingly have recognized the morally problematic nature of disability -selective abortion, the introduction of disability -selective abortion bans into legislatures, a nd the ensuing legal challenges to these bans in the courts, present marvelous occasions for disability rights activists and abortion rights activists to clash. Now, it is important to recognize that although disability rights activists are extremely wary of disability- selective abortion, it is also true that many support broad abortion rights.264 This is due to the history that people with disabilities have had with reproductive control, with third parties (i.e., family members, guardians, governments) clai ming the power to make decisions about the trajectory that the reproductive lives of people with disabilities will take.265 Laws permit people with disabilities to be forcibly sterilized, subjected to forced abortions, denied assisted reproductive technologies, coerced into contraceptive use, and to undergo procedures that affect their reproductive organs without their consent .266 Moreover, people with disabilities frequently lose custody of their children, with state legislatures and dependency courts assuming that a parent's disability makes them unfit to care for a child. 267 Because people with disabilities are intimately familiar with the horrors and indignities of reproductive control, many are loath to allow states to prohibit abortion and, in so doing, e xert reproductive control by coercing people with the capacity for pregnancy into motherhood. The advent of disability -selective abortion bans is not the first time that supporters of disability rights and supporters of abortion rights have been at odds Muller, supra note 30, at 485 (stating that abortion rights advocates have \"presented instances of fetal disability among the least morally ambiguous cases for abortion \"). It might be fair to say that, for the most part, abortion rights activists have not engaged in a nuanced, intelligent interrogation of the ethics and morality of disability -selective abortion. This may be owed to abortion rights activists ' failure to consider people with disabilities to be members of the group that they \u2014and the reproductive rights movement, more generally \u2014represent. See ANDERSON , supra note 222, at 18 ( \"Despite the f act that 20 percent of U.S. women, or approximately 27 million women, are living with a disability, the U.S. reproductive rights movement has largely overlooked the concerns of this constituency. \"). 264.

In truth, the two groups have a long, fraught history of conflict. This history is owed to abortion rights advocates' use of the specter of disability to garner public support for abortion rights. Law professor Mary Ziegler has provided the most comprehensive history of this conflict.268 She wr ote that the 1950s witnessed the thalidomide scare, in which doctors had prescribed the drug to treat nausea during pregnancy without knowing that it caused fetal impairments. 269 Further, in the 1960s, the U nited States was hit with an epidemic of rubella; the children of persons who had been infected during their first trimester of pregnancy were often born with physical and cognitive impairments.270 Advocates for abortion rights leveraged these events in their campaign for the decriminalization of abortion. They argued that pregnant people whose fetuses had been \"damaged\" by thalidomide, rubella, or other environmental or genetic causes ought to have access to abortion to prevent the birth of health- impaired children. 271 Advocates for abortion rights also argued that a government that would compel people to birth children with \"defects\" was a heartless one.272 They argued that the humane thing for the government to do was to permit abortion for prospective parents facing such a \"horror.\"273 Significantly, many people agreed, and public opinion around abortion became more favorable.274 Eventually, abortion rights supporters' arguments shifted: they stopped contending that abortion ought to be widely available to prevent the birth of health- impaired child ren, contending instead that the ability to terminate a pregnancy was a constitutional right .275 Roe v. Wade, of c ourse, was decided on these alternative grounds.276 Nevertheless, abortion rights supporters never completely stopped describing abortion as especially necessary in cases of fetal 268. See generally Ziegler, Disability Politics , supra note 237. 269. See id. at 590. 270. See id. 271. See id. at 595 (noting that \"[i]n the aftermath of the thalidomide and rubella controversies, family -planning organizations and physicians more often used disability as a justification for legalizing abortion\" ). 272. See id. (stating that abortion law reformers in the 1960s \"used bans on abortion in cases of fetal defect to showcase the irrationality and cruelty of broad abortion bans \"). 273. Some of the language that proponents of abortion rights used to describe fetuses with impairments was truly appalling. Ziegler wrote that a leader of NARAL [National Abortio n Rights Action League, an abortion rights organization] advised those at the organization: \"When they bring up innocent fetal life, . . . keep hammering on . and unwanted infant, . . . the horror of bringing a deformed child into the world with half a head, no arms, etc. \" See id. at 599. Ziegler also cited a pamphlet produced during this time that stated : \"Legal abortion means . . . women can 't be forced to bear a deformed child. Which do you prefer . . . legal abortion? Or an anencephalous 'baby'?\" Id. at 600 (alterations in original) . 274. See Bagenstos, Life, Death , supra note 22, at 437 (noting that the contr oversies involving the health -impairing effects that thalidomide and rubella had on fetuses \"catalyzed public support for the liberalization of abortion laws \"). 275. See Ziegler, Disability Politics , supra note 237, at 597 (describing this shift in argumentation). 276. 410 U.S. 113, 153 (1973) (locating the abortion right in \"the Fourteenth Amendment 's concept of personal liberty \"). 347 2022] THE DYSGENIC STATE impairment; indeed, they continued to describe such a diagnosis as a tragedy befalling prospective parents who had wished, in vain, for a \"healthy\"277 baby. More recent controversies over legislation that bans abortion in the second half of pregnancy \u2014frequently called \"late -term\" abortion \u2014have continued this discursive tradition.278 After several state legislatures passed regulations that prohibit abortion after twenty weeks of pregnancy, abortion -rights proponents often responded that prospective parents need the right to terminate a pregnancy beyond the time limit provided in the legislation because fetal \"anomalies\" are often diagnosed later in pregnancy. 279 \"Late- term\" abortion bans would have the effect of compelling pregnant people, who had received unexpected and unwanted news about their fetuses, to carry a pregnancy to term. As two commentators remarked: Disability in the context of a termination decision for a wanted pregnancy has been described as a \"tragedy \" and a \"defect \"\u2014using the language of pain, suffering, and devastation. The focus is on the potential suffering a child with a disability will allegedly experience and inevitably bring on parents and other siblings. 280 Disability rights proponents have criticized th is rhetoric, arguing that it problematically \"reinforce[s] the misconception that the diagnosis of a genetic disability is a 'tragedy' and will be 'inimical to a rewarding life' for both the child and their parents.\"281 Ziegler wrote that while abortion -rights supporters presented themselves as compassionate advocates for people facing a tragic diagnosis, opponents of abortion rights began presenting themselves as the truly compassionate ones who were interested in social justice.282 They were the ones who were concerned about the most vulnerable parties involved: the fetuses -cum-babies who would be \"killed\" on account of their disabilities. Disability- selective abortion bans are 277. If disability is understood as part of the spectrum of human variation, then a person with a disability is not \"unhealthy, \" but rather simply embodies a nonnormative state of health.

Carhart , 550 U.S. 124, 168 (2007) \u2014 also presented an occasion for abortion -rights advocates to frame disability as inevitably tragic. See Ziegler, Disability Politics , supra note 237, at 610 (explaining that abortion rights advocates treated intact dilation and extraction \"as a measure of last resort, available only in the most readily justifiable abortions \" and quoting the leader of NARAL who argued that permitting the procedure evidenced \"compassion and concern for families facing medical tragedies \"). 279. See ANDERSON , supra note 222, at 34 (explaining that \"when the state of Nebraska enacted a law limiting access to abortion from 24 to 20 weeks, \" reproductive rights organizations argued that the laws were bad policy by \"center[ing] the experiences of women who had received a diagnosis of a fetal impairment after 20 weeks in their advocacy effo rts\"). 280.

The Harms of Disability -Selective Abortion Even if one generally is supportive of abortion rights \u2014understanding them as tools that allow people with the capacity for pregnancy to exert some measure of control over the course and content of their lives \u2014one should recognize that disability- selective abortions can be extremely problematic. One does not have to believe that the fetus is a \"life\"284 or is morally significant to conclude that disability- selective a bortion possesses some extremely disquieting characteristics. To begin, there is the possibility that many people terminate a pregnancy following a diagnosis of fetal impairment without receiving truthful information about the effect that the impairment w ould have on their child should they choose to carry the pregnancy to term. Scholars and activists have raised the possibility that healthcare providers do not provide accurate, evidence -based information to prospective parents. 285 They have argued that prov iders frequently underestimate the quality of life that the child can expect to have while overestimating the pain or other limitations associated with the condition.286 If true, then many decisions to terminate a pregnancy following a diagnosis of impairme nt may be ill- informed or uninformed.287 If it is built upon a scaffolding of misinformation , disability- selective abortion is a disquieting practice. 283. See id. at 612 (noting t hat disability -selective abortion bans are the result of abortion opponents ' having \"translat[ed] arguments against disability -based abortion into concrete legal prohibitions\" ). 284. See generally Khiara M. Bridges, \"Life\" in the Balance: Judicial Review of Abortion Regulations , 46 UC DAVIS L. REV. 1285 (2013) (elaborating the concept of fetal \"life,\" understood as a cultural idea of the fetus 's moral significance that renders the fetus much weightier, morally speaking, than simple biological life). 285. See, e.g., Bagenstos, Life, Death , supra note 22, at 433 (describing disability -rights activists ' arguments that \"physicians take advantage of parents ' vulnerability by 'misinform[ ing] them about the nature of their child 's handicapping condition and the prospects for the child 's development, education, and future, ' and by 'resorting to medical nomenclature to disguise the nonmedical grounds of the recommendation'\" to terminate the pregnancy (alteration in original)). 286. See id. at 440 (observing that disability -rights advocates often contend that \"the advice pregnant women receive after discovering a fetal disability focuses on (often unduly) negative predictions about short life expectancies and extensive medical needs rather than on the ways children with disabilities 'can participate in the life of the family, school and community '\"). 287. See Porter, supra note 31, at 785 (noting the claim that many decisions to terminate a pregnancy following a prenatal diagnosis of disability are \" misinformed \"). In order to reduce the likelihood that a prospective parent 's decision to undergo an abortion following a diagnosis of fetal impairment will be ill -informed, Congress in 2008 passed the Prenatally and Postnatally Diagnosed Conditions Awareness Act (PPDCA), which was intended to empower the government to provide prospective parents with accurate information about impairments \"so that they could make thoughtful decisions about raising children with certain genetic disorders. \" Seema Mohapatra, Law in the Time of Zika: Disability Rights and Reproducti ve Justice Collide, 84 BROOK . L. REV. 325, 359- 60 (2019). However, Congress has never allocated sufficient funds to the PPDCA to make the legislation meaningful. See id . at 360. \"Originally envisioned with a '$5 million [base] of funding to support its objectives, ' the PPDCA passed with no funding provisions.

They say that such abortions send a hurtful, hateful message that people with disabilities never should have been born\u2014 that their lives are not worth living.288 Moreover, these abortions might sanction bias and discrimination, affirming the senti ment that people with disabilities are rightly shunned and avoided.289 This might also perpetuate and normalize the belief that technology ought to be used to diminish disability \u2014a phenomenon that has implications for how we think about and use technology. Finally, there is the very real concern that if prospective parents use abortion to prevent the birth of people with disabilities, then the likelihood that people without disabilities will come to encounter those with disabilities will diminish. 290 Conseque ntly, occasions for reevaluating concepts like \"health,\" \"dignity,\" and \"humanity\" \u2014concepts that we may desperately need to reconsider \u2014will disappear.291 Further, on a more pragmatic level, if disability - selective abortion significantly reduces the number o f people with disabilities, then we may feel no need to reorganize our society to allow those with impairments to meaningfully participate.292 We will continue to recreate a underfunded since it passed, and thus the goal to provide women with information prenatally and postnatally has not been met. \" Id. 288.

Of course, we might be convinced that disability -selective abortion can be harmful, but nevertheless conclude that it should not be banned. We might believe that it is callous to compel the birth of children with disabilit ies in a society that refuses to adequately support parents who care for these children.293 This callousness is intensified when the parent is poor and unable to provide for the child's needs without assistance. We may conclude that the most human e thing that we can do is not to ban disability -selective abortion, but rather to engage in practical efforts that will make the country more hospitable for, and less unkind to, people with disabilities. We may conclude that in addition to this work, we ought to make the country more supportive of families, generally, and families caring for people with disabilities, specifically. Until this transformative work is accomplished, we may feel that it is necessary, and morally right, to allow pregnant people to decide whether or not they are capable of undertaking the challenges associated with parenting a health -impaired child. 294 We may likewise disfavor regulating disability -selective abortion because such regulation creates a terrifyingly powerful state that polices its citizens' reasons for engaging in deeply intimate practices. C. The Constitutionality of Disability -Selective Abortion Bans Existing Supreme Court precedent creates a hostile terrain for disability - selec tive abortion bans, and reasons -based abortion bans more generally. If these prohibitions are to survive review, it will be because the Court has overruled some of its precedent. This is precisely the result for which these bans' proponents hope. Further, with the appointment of Justice Amy Coney Barrett to the Court, the composition of the Court has shifted enough to make the overruling of abortion precedent very likely. 295 of Ind. & Ky. , 888 F.3d at 315 (arguing that permitting people to terminate a pregnancy because of a Down syndrome diagnosis \"disincentivizes research that might help [people with Down syndrome] in the future \"). 293.

As Deckha poignantly describe d it, although we may aspire to value all people equally, people may still select against disabili ty \"because they do not want to or cannot assume the extra care - giving and financial responsibilities or concerns that they forecast will be involved, and the pressures they anticipate these responsibilities will place on their existing relationships. \" See Deckha, supra note 21, at 28.

Dianne Feinstein , Ranking Member, Comm. on the Judiciary (Oct. 9, 2020) , 351 2022] THE DYSGENIC STATE Planned Parenthood v. Casey affirmed Roe v. Wade's holding that the Constitution protects the right to terminate a pregnancy before fetal viability, but it replaced Roe's trimester framework with a new test for evaluating the constitutionality of abortion regulations \u2014the undue burden standard.296 The standard allows states to regulate abor tion to promote fetal life and protect pregnant people's health throughout the entirety of pregnancy \u2014including prior to fetal viability.297 If a regulation places a \"substantial obstacle\" in a pregnant person's path to an abortion, however, the regulation poses an undue burden on the abortion right and, consequently, is unconstitutional.298 Casey explained that to avoid being an undue burden, abortion regulations must be \"calculated to inform the woman's free choice, not hinder it.\"299 Accordingly, Casey upheld laws that require that pregnant people receive certain information (about the fetus's moral status, or the availability of state benefits or adoption services) prior to the abortion procedure, or that impose waiting periods that purport to ensure that a pregnant person has time to contemplate information received. 300 Although these regulations make abortion more inaccessible for the most vulnerable people\u2014 because they increase the financial (and, perhaps, emotional) costs of the procedure \u2014they do not impose an undue burden under Casey because, according to the Court, they ensure that the decision to terminate a pregnancy is fully informed.301 In Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt, the Court added some gloss to the undue burden standard.302 There, the Court c larified that the standard requires reviewing courts to weigh the costs and the benefits of a regulation.303 The Court stated that a regulation does not pose an undue burden if the benefits that a https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Amy%20Coney%20Barrett%20Senate%20Question naire%20Supplement.pdf [https://perma.cc/X5DF -KD6R] (a letter, which Barrett signed as a law professor at the University of Notre Dame, that blames Roe for the \"over 55 million unborn children [who] have been killed by abortions, \" laments the Court 's \"infamous \" decision in Roe, and \"renews [the] call for the unborn to be protected in law \"); Comm 'r of Ind .

Disability -selective abortion bans are unconstitutional under the Court's existing abortion jurisprudence.305 As pre -viability abortion ban s, they fly in the face of Casey 's directive that regulations must be \"calculated to inform the wom an's free choice, not hinder it.\"306 Indeed, Casey explicitly held that \"a State may not prohibit any woman from making the ultimate decision to terminate her pregnancy before viability.\"307 But, that is precisely what pre -viability disability- selective abortion bans do: they prohibit the pregnant person from making the ultimate decision to terminate their pregnancy before viability. A regulation requiring that a person carrying a fetus with an impairment receive information about parenting a child with a disability before an abortion would be o n more solid constitutional ground.308 A regulation that, like most states' disability - selective abortion bans, completely prevents pre- viability abortions based on fetal impairment would be m ore clearly unconstitutional.

See Box, 139 S.

The Court may sign off on the constitutionality of disability -selective abortion bans in a more indirect \u2014but equally devastating\u2014 manner. In Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization , petitioners have asked the Court to overrule Roe v. Wade altogether.317 If the Court grants the petitioners' request, then disability -selective abortion bans, and all other abortion bans, will pose no constitutional problem. D. Disability -Selective Abortion Bans as \"Anti -Eugenic\" For years, critics of disability -selective abortion have described the practice as a \"eugenic\" tool that permits prospective parents to prevent the birth of \"undesirable\" children. 318 Proponents of disability -selective abortion bans, accordingly, describe legislation that prohibits this pract ice as \"anti- eugenic.\"319 This discourse was rife in the litigation surrounding Indiana's reasons -based abortion ban, with judges sympathetic to the ban vilifying reasons- based abortion 315. See id. at 1782 (stating that the Court would not express a view on the constitutionality of reasons -based abortion bans because it was choosing to follow its \"ordinary practice of denying petitions insofar as they raise[d] legal issues that have not been considered by additional Courts of Appeals \"). The Court in Box did reverse the Seventh Circuit 's decision to strike down the law 's requirement that fetal tissue be disposed of in a manner that is more \"respectful\" of fetal life. The law 's challengers had argued, strategically, that the fetal disposition regulation did not implicate the abortion right and, as such, should be reviewed using only rational basis review. The Seventh Circuit held that the law did not pass even this low level of review. The Supreme Court disagreed and upheld the regulation under rational basis review. Id. at 1782. The Court was clear that its holding that the regulation survived rational basis review said nothing about the question of the regulation 's constitutio nality under the undue burden standard. See id. Of note, lower courts reviewing similar regulations have found that they fail under this test. See Whole Woman' s Health v. Smith , 338 F. Supp. 3d 606, 643 (W.D. Tex. 2018) (enjoining a Texas fetal disposition regulation under the undue burden standard after finding that the law will increase the cost of abortion care and impose other obstacles that will make many providers unable to provide abortion services). 316.

Planned Parenthood , in which the Court decided not to take on the question of whether Indiana's reasons -based abortion ban was constitutional.323 Indeed, Thomas's concurring opinion repeated the word \"eugenic\" more than one hundred times \u2014a fact made more striking when one considers that the parties had not even briefed the issue of eugenics.324 In the opinion, Thomas tied the eugenics movement in the U nited States to the movement that sought to legalize birth control \u2014asserting that many eugenicists were also avid proponents of birth control.325 He specifically 320. See Planned Parenthood of Ind. & Ky., Inc. v. Comm 'r of Ind.

Planned Parenthood of Ind. & Ky., 917 F.3d at 536 (Easterbrook, J., dissenting). Easterbrook also referred to the provision of the Indiana law that prohibits abortion on the basis of race, sex, and disability as \"the eugenics statute\" and argued that \"[u]sing abortion to promote eugenic goals is morally and prudentially debatable on grounds different from those that underlay the statutes Casey considered. \" Id. Easterbrook 's dissent argued that Casey 's undue burden standard may be relevant only when reviewing courts endeavor to balance the pregnant person 's interest in terminating a pregnancy against the state 's interest in promoting fetal life and the health of the pregnant person. See id. The dissent argued that because the Court in Casey did not consider the state 's interest in preventing the use of abortion \"to promote eugenic goals, \" Casey was inapplicable to laws, like the one at issue, that pursued antidiscrimination goals. See id. Thus, Casey 's blanket prohibition of pre -viability abortion bans may be inapplicable. See id. 322. See id. 323. See Box v. Planned Parenthood of Ind. & Ky., Inc. , 139 S.

See id. 356 CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 110: 297 identified Margaret Sanger, the well-known birth control activist , as a sympathizer to, if not a full -fledged member of, the American eugenics movement.326 He argued that because the eug enics movement was racist, many eugenicists- cum-birth control proponents operationalized th eir racism by foisting birth control on unsuspecting black people.327 Thomas looked to Sanger's work to establish birth control clinics in black communities as damning evidence of the anti -blackness of the birth control movement.328 After endeavoring to establish that birth control has \"eugenic potential\" insofar as some turn -of-the-century birth control supporters wanted to use it to prevent \"undesirable\" people from reproducing, Thomas argued that abortion has even more eugenic potential: abortion could be used to prevent existing, identified \"undesirable\" fetuses from being born.329 Thomas argued that contemporary abortion continues to reflect the racism harbored by eugenicists who, although never advocating for the availability of abortion,330 advocated for the availability of birth control \u2014a cousin of sorts to abortion. Thomas supported the claim that modern abortion furthers the racist eugenic goal of preventing nonwhite reproduction with statistics documenting the disproportionate rate at which black people currently undergo abortions.331 Moreover, Thomas relied on statistics documenting that people frequently terminate pregnancies after a 326. See Box, 139 S.

Murray argued that Justice Thomas 's endeavor to excavate the racial salience of ab ortion is part of a strategy to undermine abortion rights altogether. See id. at 2029 ( \"[R]ather than surfacing race as a means of promoting greater reproductive autonomy and access in service of Roe v.

Notably, Thomas connected eugenics to abortion more directly, arguing that some eugenicists argued that abortion should be legal. See id. at 1784, 1789 (Thomas, J., concurring) (stating that \"[m]any eu genicists . . . supported legalizing abortion \" and that \"some eugenicists believed that abortion should be legal for the very purpose of promoting eugenics\" ). Importantly, a chorus of historians have denied that eugenicists supported legalizing abortion. See discussion infra notes 335- 339 and accompanying text. 331. See Box, 139 S.

However, the point that most historians underscore, time and again, is that the most influential eugenicists and eugenics organizations did not support abortion.337 Abortion was criminalized during the heyday of the eugenic s movement, and the eugenics movement did not advocate for its legalization. In fact, abortion repulsed many eugenicists. Indeed, Margaret Sanger, who Thomas accused of being a eugenicist, called abortion \"sordid,\" \"abnormal,\" a \"disgrace,\" and a \"horror[].\"338 332.

Yet, the admission did not stop him from proposing that Sanger' s espousal of eugenic ideals, when coupled with her support of abortion, comfortably aligned eugenics and eugenicists with abortio n. 358 CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 110: 297 Other critiques of Thomas's opinion emphasize that Thomas omitted the forcible nature of eugenics.339 These critiques underscore that eugenics programs used coercive means to prevent the reproduction of people whom it considered undesirable.340 In stark contrast, no one forces an abortion on the prospective parent who decides to terminate a pregnancy because of a diagnosis of a fetal impairment.341 Similarly, no one forces the black people who undergo abortions at disproportionate rates to terminate their pregnancies. Rather, black people choose abortion at disproportionate rates because poverty, violence, inadequate sex education, and inaccessible healthcare have co nstrained their ability to avoid unwanted pregnancies.342 As a result, for marginalized black people, abortion figures not as a weapon in the eugenicist's arsenal, but rather as a tool that black people use to help them navigate the structural constraints on their reproductive lives, and their lives generally. 343 Scholars have also argued that Thomas's likening of contemporary practices of disability- selective abortion to eugenics is erroneous because people who terminate a pregnancy following a diagnosis of fetal impairment do not make that reproductive decision because of anxiety about the country's gene pool\u2014the concern of the eugenics movement in the early twentieth century.344 Rather, people who terminate a pregnancy after discovering that the child will be born with a disability do so because they have decided that taking that path is the right choice for them. 345 The latter decision is profoundly individualist in the 339. See Rosenberg, supra note 334. 340. See Cohen, supra note 325 (noting that in \"eugenic sterilization, the state decides who may not reproduce\" ). 341.

Meanwhile, the reproductive programs of eugenicists were wholly collectivist in the sense that eugenicists pursued them because they believed them to be good for the nation (and the world).346 In short, Thomas's likening of the contemporary practice of abortion to the eugenics movement of the early twentieth century fully, and opportunistically, misread history.347 Moreover, we ought to be wary of the selective compassion that Thomas demonstrates in his thought. Regarding disability, Thomas's Box concurre nce evidenced a deep concern about fetuses with disabilities \u2014fetuses that may never be born on account of the easy availability of abortion. However, Thomas has evidenced little concern about people with disabilities. Indeed, he has joined a number of opin ions that argued in favor of narrowing the reach of the Americans with Disabilities Act, thus reducing the ability of the landmark legislation to reorganize society such that people with disabilities can meaningfully participate in it. 348 Additionally, we w ould not be unreasonable if we suppose that his well -documented political conservatism would lead him to oppose the \"big government\" efforts\u2014 like expanding state -sponsored that she does not want to give birth to a child who, for example, would die in infancy after a brief life of extreme pain. \"). 346. See discussion supra Part I.A. 347. Of course, this is not the first time that Thomas opportunistically misread history. Perhaps the most egregious misreading of history that Thomas conducted is when he quoted Frederick Douglass in his dissent in Grutter v. Bollinger and suggested that Douglass believed that third parties, like the state, ought not to help black peo ple navigate a society in which chattel slavery had recently ended. 539 U.S. 306, 349, 349 -350 (2003) (Thomas, J., dissenting) (excerpting a speech by Douglass as a prelude to his argument that the Constitution prohibits race consciousness in college admis sions). He quoted Douglass as saying: The American people have always been anxious to know what they shall do with us . . . . I have had but one answer from the beginning. Do nothing with us! Your doing with us has already played the mischief with us. Do n othing with us! If the apples will not remain on the tree of their own strength, if they are worm -eaten at the core, if they are early ripe and disposed to fall, let them fall! . . .

The full quote from Douglass reveals that Douglass was asking white people not to assault and murder black people, nor interfere w ith their civil and political rights. He was not at all making an argument that the government ought not to help people recently freed from enslavement. And if the negro cannot stand on his own legs, let him fall also. All I ask is, give him a chance to stand on his own legs! Let him alone! If you see him on his way to school, let him alone, \u2014 don't disturb him!

Thomas also exhibits selective compassion when it comes to race. Thomas's Box concurrence evidenced a deep concern about the fetuses that black people gestate \u2014fetuses that may never be born on account of the disproportionate rates at which black people turn to abortion care. But Thomas never evidenced a concern for the black people who gestate those fetuses . Had he contemplated these folks, he would have seen that activists like Margaret Sanger did not foist contraception upon them; they did not dupe black people into using contraception as part of a diabolical genocidal plot. Instead, black people with the capacity for pregnancy desperat ely wanted contraception so that they could exert some control over whether they would become pregnant. 350 Further, when it comes to abortion in the modern era, Thomas explained black people's disproportionate reliance on abortion care in terms of individual racists who are targeting black pregnant people for abortion. He ignored the fact that structural racism \u2014in the form of laws and policies that result in black people's coming to bear disproportionate burdens of poverty, as well as laws and policies that deny impoverished people access to basic healthcare, including contraception \u2014provides a better explanation of black peoples' disproportionate reliance on abortion care. 351 Again, we are not unreasonable if we suppose that Thomas's well -documented political conservatism, as well as his commitment to \"muscular self -help\" as the pathway to racial justice,352 would lead him to oppose efforts to dismantle structural racism.353 While this Part has endeavored to show that disability -selective abortions are not \"eugenic,\" this Article has argued that disability -selective abortion bans \u2014when operating in the context of environmental injustices \u2014are dysgenic. Indeed, while the eugenic state no longer exists, the dysgenic state is alive and well. The final Part concludes the analysis with a focus on the racial and class 349. Of course, Justice Thomas voted to strike down the largest expansion of state -sponsored healthcare in the modern era \u2014the Affordable Care Act. See Nat'l Fed'n Indep. Bus. v. Sebelius, 567 U.S. 519 (2012). 350. See, e.g. , Murray, supra note 326, at 2040 ( \"[S]cholars have noted that increased access to birth control was not simply thrust upon the Black community in an unwelcome attempt to reduce the Black birthrate . . . .\" ). 351.

Indeed, Thomas has expressed skepticism about the very existence of structural racism. See Grutter v. Bollinger , 539 U.S. 306, 377 (2003) (Thomas, J., dissenting) (referring to \"institutional racism \" as a belief that \"conspiracy theorists \" hold). 361 2022] THE DYSGENIC STATE politics of the dysgenic state. It shows that the dysgenic state, like the eugenic state, similarly functions to produce the white population as pathology -free, with pathology being found mostly among nonwhite people and the poor. The dysgenic state, however, achieves this modernized version of white racia l purity through a combination of environmental neglect and reproductive coercion that functions to generate and concentrate pathology among the nonwhite and the poor. The Part then shows that the racial and class politics of the dysgenic state are such that it problematically reinforces the myth of biological race \u2014a myth that proposes that the biology of people of color explains why they are sicker and die earlier than their white counterparts. V. T HE RACIAL AND CLASS POLITICS OF THE DYSGENIC STATE A. Dysgeni cs and the Production of Eugenic Results While the dysgenic state appears to be the inverse of the eugenic state, it actually functions to produce results that are virtually indistinguishable from the goals of the eugenic state. More precisely , while the e ugenic state worked to produce a citizenry that was free of impairment, and while the dysgenic state produces an impaired citizenry, the societies that result from the two states' operations are essentially the same. As discussed above, the assumptions tha t undergirded the eugenics movement in the U nited States at the turn of the century were racist, classist, xenophobic, and ableist. 354 These assumptions coalesced in the eugenic affirmation that non -poor, native -born, non- disabled white people were collecti vely in possession of the genes that would save the country, and the world, from falling into disrepair.355 The future that eugenics sought to realize \u2014 through the action of a competent state that incentivized the reproduction of the desirable and forcibly constrained the reproduction of the undesirable \u2014was one in which wealthier white people predominated. The genetic heritage of this group destined them to be free of the pathologies of poverty, nonwhiteness, and, importantly, physical and mental impairments.356 Differently stated, in the eugenic imaginary, wealthier white people would be free of all pathology \u2014 including the pathology of health impairment\u2014 subsequent to the application of precise reproductive controls. If impairment was to be found in the future that the eugenics movement desperately endeavored to engineer, it would be located in the smaller populations of nonwhite people and poor people who remained, resolutely, within the nation's borders. It bears repeating: through a number of different mechan isms, including reproductive control , the eugenics movement sought to facilitate the realization 354. See supra Part I.A. 355. See supra Part I.A. 356. See Part I.A. 362 CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 110: 297 of a racial destiny in which wealthier white people were inevitably impairment- free while impairment would only be found in remaining populations of nonwhite people and poor people. Fascinatingly, the racial and class politics of the present dysgenic state produce a topography of race and disability that is similar to the topography found in the society that the eugenics movement pursued. That is, the dysgenic state, like the eugenic state, results in a society in which impairments are concentrated among those who are nonwhite or poor, while wealthier white people remain comparatively free of impairments. How exactly does the dysgenic state produce this situation? As explained above, the empirically documented fact of environmental injustice means that low -income people and people of color disproportionately bear the burdens of environmental toxins , many of which produce impairments in fetuses.357 This fact, alone, would propel our nation towards a future in which disability would be found more frequently among the nonwhite and the poor and less frequently among the white and affluent. However, the application of precise reproductive controls, this time in the form of the disability -selective abortion ban, operates to ensure the concentration of impairment among the disadvantaged. This is simply because wealth and whiteness allow those in possession of them to circumvent reproductive controls \u2014especially abortion regu lations. This was certainly true in the era before Roe v. Wade , when wealthier white women could evade the constraints of criminal abortion laws by acquiring the abortion services that they desired and needed in private doctor's offices. As historian David Garrow noted, \"there were hundreds upon hundreds of doctors in this country who secretly performed abortions for women whom they knew and who could pay.\" 358 Poor women could not avail themselves of these doctors' services, as they had neither the money to pay for the care nor the social connections to locate these doctors.359 Which is to say that before Roe, poor women could not get around criminal abortion laws. While their counterparts with class privilege (and, more often than not, race privilege) could dodge reproductive controls, poor women (who were often of color) were forced to either carry their pregnancies to term or to attempt to terminate their pregnancies under unsafe conditions.360 Very little has changed subsequent to Roe. Whil e Roe is still good law and the Constitution, at least as a formal matter, still protects the right to an abortion, 357. See supra Part I.B. and II.A. 358. David J. Garrow, Abortion Before and After Roe v. Wade : An Historical Perspective , 62 ALB. L. REV. 833, 834 (1999). 359. See id . 360. LESLIE REAGAN , WHEN ABORTION WAS A CRIME : WOMEN , MEDICINE , AND THE LAW IN THE UNITED STATES , 1867- 1973 138 (1997) (\"A study 1930s found . . . [a]ccess to physician - induced abortions and reliance upon self -induced methods for abortion varied greatly by class and race. Most affluent white women went to physicians for [illegal] abortions, while poor women an d black women self -induced them. \"). 363 2022] THE DYSGENIC STATE states continue to exert reproductive control with regard to abortion. That is, states still endeavor to compel motherhood by preventing peo ple from terminating their pregnancies. The way that they do this post -Roe is subtler, but nevertheless effective vis -\u00e0-vis marginalized people. Three particularly effective avenues of reproductive control are the Hyde Amendment, informed consent requirements (namely waiting periods ), and targeted regulations of abortion providers. First, the Hyde Amendment prohibits federal funds from being spent in the Medicaid program to cover the cost of abortion, except in cases of rape, incest, or when continuation of the pregnancy poses a threat to the life of the pregnant person. 361 The Hyde Amendment means that indigent people cannot rely on their health insurance for abortion care. The result is that the poorest, most vulnerable, Medicaid -dependent people who cannot afford to pay out -of-pocket for abortion care are forced to carry unwanted pregnancies to term.362 In this way, the Hyde Amendment is a means for the state to make poor people's bodies do what it wants them to do. At the same time, wealthier women remain u ntouched by this form of reproductive control. Second, informed consent regulations, particularly those that require pregnant people to wait a designated period of time before undergoing an abortion, similarly allow the state to make poor people's bodies d o what it wants them to do.363 Waiting periods\u2014 which are typically anywhere between twenty - four and seventy -two hours364\u2014increase the cost of abortion care because they can require pregnant people to make several trips to an abortion provider. This often means that a pregnant person will have to take more time off from work, pay more for childcare and transportation, or cover the cost of a hotel room in the city or town where the abortion provider is located. 365 While more affluent people can absorb these cost s, poorer people cannot. Consequently, poor people's bodies get subscripted into performing the labor that the state wants them to perform. 361. Pub. L. No. 103 -112, 107 S tat. 1082 (1993). 362.

Wealthier people carrying a fetus with an impairment who live in a state with a disability -selective abortion ban will be able to travel to a state that has decided not to restrict abortion in this way.370 Or, they will be abl e to find a private doctor \u2014perhaps a gynecologist or obstetrician with whom they have a longstanding relationship \u2014to perform an abortion for them despite the legal restriction.371 At the same time, low -income people carrying a fetus with an impairment will find the state's disability -selective 366.

The phenomenon of more privileged people traveling long distances to obtain the abortion care that they want is not at all new. In 1962, television personality Sherri Finkbine sought an abortion in her home state of Arizona after she discovered that a medi cation that she had taken contained thalidomide and her fetus was at an increased risk for developing impairments. On This Day 1950 -2005: 26 August 1962: Abortion Mother Returns Home , BBC NEWS, http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/august/26/new sid_3039000/3039322.stm [https://perma.cc/62BQ -JFWN ]. After the supreme court in Arizona denied her request for an abortion, which was otherwise criminalized in the state, Finkbine flew to Sweden and underwent a safe and legal abortion there. See id. 371. Oftentimes, low -income people, especially Medicaid -receiving people who get their care from public hospitals or clinics, do not have \"their own \" doctor; instead, they receive care from whomever is working in the hospital or clinic on the day of their appo intment. See, e.g. , KHIARA M. BRIDGES , REPRODUCING RACE: AN ETHNOGRAPHY OF PREGNANCY AS A SITE OF RACIALIZATION 31- 32 (2011) (explaining that in the obstetrics clinic of the public hospital studied, Medicaid recipients receive their prenatal care from a ro tating cast of residents who work in the clinic, while private patients in the private hospital nearby typically see their doctors in the doctor 's private office). 365 2022] THE DYSGENIC STATE abortion ban practically impossible to negotiate. With this group, the bans are much more likely to work as the legislatures intend: they will force low -income people to carry pregnancies to term. Thus, the fact of env ironmental injustice means that wealthier people, who are disproportionately white, will encounter fewer fetal impairments caused by environmental toxins. Moreover, the way that class privilege has always operated with respect to abortion rights and access allows us to predict that when wealthier people find themselves pregnant with a health- impaired fetus, they will be able to circumvent the abortion regulation that would otherwise compel them to give birth to a health -impaired child. Simultaneously, the f act of environmental injustice means that low -income people, who are disproportionately nonwhite, will encounter many more fetal impairments that are caused by environmental toxins. And the way that class unprivilege has always operated with respect to abo rtion rights and access allows us to predict that disability -selective abortion bans will successfully compel these racially - and socioeconomically unprivileged people to give birth to a health -impaired child. The result is a concentration of impairment among nonwhite and low-income populations with a simultaneous purging of impairment from white and affluent populations. This is precisely what the eugenic state endeavored to produce in the United States at the turn of the twentieth century. An interesting r eversal, though: whereas in the time of eugenics, the state attempted to manufacture white racial purity by removing impairments from the white race, in the time of dysgenics, the state manufactures a \"purity\" among affluent and white people by producing n onwhite and poor communities as the site for impairments. In this way, we may think of the dysgenic state as a successor to the eugenic state\u2014as an entity that addresses the eugenic state's unfinished business. Of course, the element of intentionality is a bsent from the dysgenic state: whereas the eugenic state consciously endeavored to produce white racial purity, the dysgenic state produces a version of the same without the conscious motivation of actors. 372 However, the absence of intent does not make the resulting racial geography of disability any less cruel.373 B. Dysgenics and the Reaffirmation of the Myth of Biological Race One of the foundational propositions of eugenic pseudoscience was that there are distinct, clear -cut, nonnegotiable differences between the races.374 372. Indeed, there is no evidence that proponents of disability -selective abortion bans have any awareness of how these bans will cause disability to be distributed among races and classes. 373. See generally ALEXANDER , supra note 132 (showing that mass incarceration has acted as a successor to chattel slavery inasmuch as it has functioned to produce a caste of black people as second - class citizens and denying that a set of nefarious actors consciously produced this result). 374. Hansen & King, supra note 53, at 252 (quoting a eugenicist saying that \"the character of a nation is determ ined primarily by its racial qualities: that is, by the hereditary physical, mental, and moral or temperamental traits of its people \"). 366 CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 110: 297 Moreover, eugenics asserted that these racial differences were biological in nature.375 (Indeed, eugenics asserted that all differences were biological in nature. Hence the supposition that class differences were an effect of genetic differences between the rich and the poor\u2014 which led to the conclusion that the most surefire way to eradicate poverty was to prevent the reproduct ion of the poor.) According to eugenics, it was biology that distinguished the white race from the black race from the Asian race from the American Indian race. This is the myth of biological race: the idea that the races are biologically distinct from one another, with the biological processes of the members of one racial group being similar to one another, but different from the biological processes of members of other racial groups.376 Of course, eugenics was not content to simply propose that the races were genetically distinct from one another. Rather, eugenics proposed that there was a hierarchy of racial difference, with nonwhite races being biologically inferior to the white race.377 Pushing the analysis further, it would not be an error to say that eu genics proposed that nonwhite people were impaired , as they deviated from the norms that the white race established. Indeed, the institution of chattel slavery in the U nited States was justified on this very premise: black people's biology rendered them no t intelligent enough, industrious enough, and noncriminal enough to assume the august task of freedom. 378 Of course, the institution of chattel slavery in the U nited States predates the eugenics movement \u2014demonstrating only that eugenics did not give rise to the myth of biological race, but rather simply expanded and deepened it by endeavoring to give it scientific legitimacy.

Longmore & Lauri Umansky eds., 2001) (discussing Dr. Samuel Cartwright 's research of drapetomania). Cartwright 's studies led him to the conclusion that enslaved black people ran away from the people who purported to own them because black people had a mental impairment: drapetomania. Quoting Cartwright, historian Douglas Baynton explained that drapetomania was imagined to be \"as much a disease of the mind as any other species of mental alienation \" [and] was common among slaves whose masters had \"made themselves too familiar with them, treating them as equals. \" The need to submit to a master was built into the very bodies of African Americans, in whom \"we see 'genu flexit ' written in the physical structure of his knees, being more flexed or bent, than any other kind of man. \" Id. \"[T]he disease of the mind \" from which black people suffered when treated humanely, as well as the hopelessly bent knees that led black people to feel more comfortable kneeling than standing, were impairments, as they would have greatly disadvant aged white people \u2014whose equality with one another was written into the country 's founding documents and who were expected to serve no one. Conveniently, the impairments that afflicted black people rendered them woefully unfit for freedom but superbly suite d for enslavement. Id. 367 2022] THE DYSGENIC STATE eugenics movement has established that the groups that societies call races are genetically arbitrary groupings of individuals.379 That most good science has concluded that races are biologically arbitrary collections of individuals, however, has not stopped researchers from searching for genes that they expect will explain the fact that people of color have higher rates of every major common illness and poor health outcome \u2014including hypertension, infant mortality, maternal mortality, dia betes, asthma, and heart disease.380 This point bears repeating: we should understand the elusive search for the gene that causes black people to die from everything at higher rates than white people to be a modernized version of the claim that nonwhite peo ple are impaired by virtue of their biological difference.381 Thus, the eugenics movement racialized disability \u2014positing nonwhite bodies as the site of impairments \u2014when it deployed the myth of biological race to assert that nonwhite people were biologically distinct from, and inferior to, white people. Further, we racialize disability today \u2014positing nonwhite bodies as the site of impairments\u2014 when we deploy the myth of biological race to justify spending tens of millions of dollars searching for the fantasied genes that we imagine cause nonwhite people to be sicker and die earlier than their white counterparts. Yet another contemporary mode of racializing disability \u2014of positing nonwhite bodies as the site of through actually locating impairm ents in nonwhite people's bodies. That is, the racialization of disability in modern times may occur through, truly, disabling the bodies of nonwhite people. This is an analysis that scholars Ivan Eugene Watts and Nirmala Erevelles suggested when they observed how the predominance of asthma and lead poisoning among poor children contributes to neurological damage that manifests itself as mild disabilities and behavioral disorders in schools. . . . In terms of race, 36.7% of African American children, as opposed to 17% of Latino children and 6.1% [of] White children, have been identified as experiencing lead poisoning. Such statistics point to environmentally 379.

Unlike the days of eugenics, when racial minorities were imagined to be impaired, the racialization of disability today occurs when racial minorities actually become impaired due to environmental inj ustice and reproductive control. To be precise, the dysgenic state\u2014which fails to protect its disproportionately nonwhite citizens from impairment- producing environmental toxins and then coerces those same citizens to give birth to health -impaired children \u2014racializes disability by creating a set of circumstances in which nonwhite people come to bear health - impaired children more frequently than their white counterparts. This is an injustice in and of itself. But it may be even more lamentable because it cre ates a racial geography of disability wherein the myth of biological race appears true. The racial politics of the dysgenic state makes it appear that there is just something about nonwhite people that causes them to be born more frequently with anencephal y, heart defects, oral clefts, musculoskeletal impairments, spina bifida, cognitive disabilities, etc. \u2014the entire range of impairments that environmental toxins produce in fetuses. As the myth of biological race currently serves as a vehicle for explaining racial disparities in health outcomes generally, we should have little doubt that it will serve as a tool for understanding the dysgenic state's yield: higher frequencies of impairments among nonwhite babies and people. C ONCLUSION The dysgenic state is wh at happens when the impulse to save fetuses coincides with a failure to protect citizens from environmental toxins. That is, the dysgenic state is a marriage between two distinct interest groups: while one interest group insists upon protecting fetuses fro m abortion, another interest group reminds that it is expensive to protect certain communities from environmental harms. Indeed, regulating toxic industries costs money: it threatens the profits of the corporations that would be forced to internalize the costs of the externalities that they impose on vulnerable people and communities. To protect coffers, the state has decided to let capitalism go unregulated \u2014to let the free market operate freely. The intersection of free market enterprise with the struggle to ensure that every fetus that is conceived is carried to term has given us the dysgenic state. As this Article makes clear, the dysgenic state functions as a successor of sorts to the eugenic state of a century ago: like its twentieth -century counterpart , dysgenics operates to generate a white racial purity against a backdrop of nonwhite impairment. The analysis in this Article, then, disproves the claim that disability- selective abortion bans are \"anti -eugenic.\" In fact, when such bans are 382.

RSCH.J.271, 290 (2004). 369 2022] THE DYSGENIC STATE set in a conte xt of environmental injustice, they are profoundly eugenic , producing results that would make eugenicists of the early twentieth century smile. We might remind these bans' proponents that there is an irony \u2014and cruelty \u2014involved in compelling the births of f etuses with disabilities without simultaneously eliminating the processes that disable fetuses. Indeed, there is an inhumanity involved in struggling to save fetuses with impairments without also struggling against the industrially sponsored, state -supported production of fetal impairment. We could interrupt the operation of the dysgenic state by battling disability - selective abortion bans, working to ensure that they are struck down in court or repealed by legislatures. But, as this Article ma kes clear, success on this front would do nothing to protect fetuses \u2014and people\u2014 from the injury that degraded environments inflict. So, in order to make dysgenics \u2014and eugenics\u2014 a phenomenon of the past, we need to fight for environmental justice as well. We must not settle for partial victories. "}
