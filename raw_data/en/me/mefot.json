Diane has worked with clients of all ages and stages in life with a holistic but balanced manner where the goal of a person's individual health is what is most healthy for them within the lifestyle they lead. This led to a specific interest in how an individual's health is varied and individual and also socially structured culminating in of a Masters in Science in Health Psychology that Diane is finishing in 2023. A MESSAGE FROM DIANE: My passion is about understanding a person's health from the individual needs that includes mental, emotional, and physical; not what I or anyone else considers the best but what you consider is the best balance of health within your lifestyle. Homeopathic treatment is based on the whole individual and what it is you require to be brought back into balance. Homeopathic remedies have been used to kick start the body into bringing about balance on its own using the theory of 'like cures like' - for example if you get the 'jitters' (physically and mentally) from drinking too much coffee the remedy we would use would be a remedy that produces those same or similar symptoms - most often the remedy Coffea (made from coffee beans). My background in psychology and social anthropology enables me to take a further step outside and help bring about balance through understandings of cultural and societal patterns and how we are situated within those patterns and how they may affect our health. WHAT TO EXPECT DURING YOUR SESSION: The initial session for an adult usually takes about 1 and \u00bd hours; for a child about 1 hour. We talk about your health and medical history and unpack any patterns that may show up during the initial overview. We plan on how to begin treatment and what you would like achieved and you will generally receive a single dose of the homeopathic remedy to kick start the process. The follow up sessions are 45 minutes, and we will assess what changes or things you noticed since the initial session then make a plan from there for treatment. This is not always cut and dried as people's responses vary. As homeopathy treats the person not the 'condition' homeopathy is suitable for all; it is super safe during pregnancy, breastfeeding and easily and safely used alongside any medications. COST: Initial Consult (Adult) 1 and \u00bd hours $120.00 Initial Consult (Child) 1 hour $90.00 Follow "}
