Generally, updates are made as new recommendations are published by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). An interim protocol is published when clinical guidance is needed but the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommendations haven't yet been published in the MMWR. The interim protocol will be replaced with a final protocol once the recommendations are published. Some of the current model immunization and pharmacy protocols have expired. The Oregon Immunization Program (OIP) is in the process of reviewing these expired protocols for updates. OIP anticipates having this completed by January 31, 2023. Until that time, with the approval of the Immunization Program's medical director, OIP is extending the expiration date to January 31, 2023 . OIP does not anticipate that the needed updates to these protocols are significant or that following the currently published protocols as written will cause any issues. Please direct any questions "}
