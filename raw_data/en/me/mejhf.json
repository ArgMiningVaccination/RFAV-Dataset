With years of juice cleansing experience, our health experts can help guide you. Let us be the first to welcome you to the family! You've taken the first step of this adventure by committing to a Juice From the RAW cleanse... but what's next? First, evaluate your eating habits and establish an appropriate pre-cleanse diet length. This will prepare your body to fight against negative detox symptoms that include lack of energy, headaches, aches, irritation, anxiety, and diarrhea, among others. Simply put, plan ahead and reap all the benefits. Check some [research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5438379/) before doing a healthy juice cleanse. What Best Describes You + How To Prepare Your Body Junk Food Addict You're a sweet tooth whose diet consists of foods loaded with sugar; you indulge in fast food on a regular basis and you catch yourself downing more soda than water. Our experts recommend a full week transition to avoid potential negative detox symptoms. Cut down on the junk and switch to salads for lunch and fruits for dessert. The Classic American Diet You opt for a box of pasta, microwaved meals, and burgers and fries on a weekly basis aka pre-packaged and processed foods. Dedicate 5 days for a transition by planning your meals in advance and incorporating as many fruits and veggies as possible. Weekend Splurger You stick to a healthy diet during the week but once Friday hits, you like to partake in the happy hour specials, indulgent Saturday dinners, and the heavy Sunday brunches. For 3-4 days eliminate processed foods and alcohol you consumed over the weekend. Choose a side salad instead of french fries and go for a glass of water instead of a mimosa. Health Nut You blend a mean green smoothie and hunt for the latest [superfood trends](/blogs/blog/superfood-spotlight-dandelions). But you cheated on your low-cal oatmeal breakfast with waffles last week. Time to get back on track! Spend 1-2 days reminding your body what it feels like to eat clean. Pre-Juice Cleanse Hit List To bring your body down to a more alkaline state, cut out or significantly reduce the following acid forming foods: - Alcohol - Dairy - Refined sugar Including corn syrup, white, and powdered sugars - Animal Products Including bacon, red meats, jerky, sausages, etc. - Caffeine Keep coffee intake to a minimum and eliminate all sodas - Processed foods Any boxed, canned, and bagged foods containing artificial flavoring, preservatives, and additives are considered processed So clear your calendar accordingly. Choose the days or a week where extra work and social engagements will not distract you and possibly tempt you during your cleanse. Just think of these days as a gift to yourself to nourish and heal. During the juice cleanse Congrats! Now that your juices have arrived, it's time to put your body and mind to the test. How to do a cleanse? Below, we answer a few questions you may have during your cleanse. When do I defrost my juices? Your juices will be sent to you frozen to maintain freshness. Remember our juices are unpasteurized, which means the enzymes and good bacteria are still alive. We freeze the juices right after they are pressed to keep the nutrients from deteriorating. We strongly recommend defrosting 1-days' worth of juices at a time, the day before you are going to use them. Generally it takes about 4-6 hours for juices to defrost at room temperature. When they're mostly thawed but still very cold, place the juices including vegetable juice in the fridge so you can start in the morning. Do not defrost overnight! Once thawed, the juices only last about 3-4 days. *Note: keep frozen if you're NOT starting your cleanse right away! Juices can stay frozen up to 6 months. When should I drink my juices? The order of the cleanse is set to help you function easily throughout the day. If you're doing the 3-Day Juice Cleanse with Coconut Fusion for example, start with your green cold pressed juice as your breakfast and end the day with a Coconut Fusion. Drink each portion in 2-3 hour intervals or when you start feeling hungry\u2014the timing is not set in stone. You can have as much water as you like throughout the day. For more information on the order of the juices, check out our [instructions page](https://www.juicefromtheraw.com/pages/juice-cleanse-instructions). I'm not feeling so good, why? You may have fallen victim to the nasty detox symptoms we mentioned earlier. These side effects include a decrease in energy, potential mood swings, and aches, among other things. Your body is working very hard to release the toxins built up inside. Not to mention, you're drinking a lot of fruits and veggies 6 times a day (something your body may not be used to). So don't panic if you start to feel any of these. The severity of the symptoms all depends on the amount of toxins inside your body. But don't forget that everyone's body reacts differently and you may or may not feel any of these symptoms during your cleanse. Getting enough sleep can help. If you suffer from insomnia or just have trouble getting to sleep, yoga and meditation can also help. Don't forget to drink up! Drinking up to 8 cups of water a day helps flush out the toxins faster and will get you back on track to feeling amazing. Listen to your body! If your body is not responding well to the cleanse, add some food to balance out the organic juices. Be attuned to your body, only do what you can handle. Can I eat anything during my cleanse? Although food is not allowed during the cleanse, an exception is made for a handful of raw nuts or 1 serving of vegetables a day (any kind you like) with a touch of salt to balance out your sodium intake. What about coffee, can I drink it? Worried about caffeine withdrawals during your healthy juice cleanse? It's hard to break a coffee kick, we get it. So coffee lovers can rest easy: drinking small amounts of black coffee is okay! And of course, water! I'm not hungry but I just need to chew something, anything! Stop for a moment and check in with yourself. Are you actually hungry or just craving the chewing sensation? If you're craving the chewing sensation, try to forget about it! You can do this! Occupy yourself as much as possible\u2014drink water, start that new book on your desk, take a long walk\u2014and surely enough, you'll forget. If your body is begging for food, check out the snacks mentioned above. Can I exercise during the cleanse? We do not recommend rigorous exercise during the cleanse because it is too much on the body. Try gentle exercise such as stretching and yoga to relax your body and mind. After your finish cleansing Time flies when you're having fun doing juice cleanses! Take a moment to congratulate yourself on a job well done! After you've rebuilt, reclaimed and re-activated your health, the final stage of the journey is the transition back to your normal life and diet. Take It Slow As much as you may want to dig into a steak and red wine the first day back, remember to not overload your organs and body during this transition. This will undo all the internal balance you have earned. Because your body has not processed these foods in a while, it may cause negative side effects. So don't rush back into your habitual life and foods\u2014they're not going anywhere. Respect your body and the hard cleansing work it has done for you. Foods you should avoid include: alcohol, dairy, red meat, fried and/or processed foods. Transition Into a Healthy Lifestyle Incorporate habits from your pre-cleanse and cleanse program to continue supporting your health\u2014wean off the hit list, eat more fruits and vegetables, drink lots of water, and keep juicing. The [Maintenance Cleanse](https://www.juicefromtheraw.com/products/maintenance-greens) is the perfect option because it was specifically created to help you maintain a healthy lifestyle. Monitor Yourself For those suffering from food allergens or sensitivities, this is the perfect opportunity for you to keep track and target what may be hurting you. This includes sensitivities to wheat, dairy, nuts, soy, etc. To identify whether any of these are triggers, systematically add them back into your diet one at a time. By doing so, you can accurately pinpoint the allergen. For example, if you reintroduce dairy into your diet and feel symptoms such as cramping, headaches, or diarrhea, you may be sensitive to dairy products. Repeat Regular detoxification is a great way to maintain your health. Cleansing removes toxicity, layers at a time. The more you cleanse, the deeper it taps and addresses different areas of the body. After the 3-day cleanse, we recommend repeating the cleanse every couple of months. Need More Help?
