Chiropractic treatment is based on the physical process of repositioning the vertebrae of the spine and the bones of a person's extremities. This, in turn, reduces pressure on the nervous system. Gentle manipulation often reduces nerve interference, thereby reducing stress, slowing down the rate of wear and tear on the body and the joints, and rejuvenating the whole neuro-muscular system. Modern scientific research constantly underscores the correlation between the neurological system, the endocrine system and the immune system in the human body. All of these systems are mutually interdependent. Each system is intimately bound and integrated with one another. In recent years, we have come to understand that free communication is imperative between all of these various systems, if they are to function properly and ensure the health of the individual. The key to increased communication is the reduction of nerve interference. Therefore, changing the movement of joints or repositioning one's relationship to a gravitational environment is of the utmost importance. By relieving nerve suppression and increasing mobility and movement, the input to the central nervous system (which directly impacts all of these other systems) is constructively altered. We have found through thousands of successful cases that chiropractic treatment is essential for the restoration of functional health. Proper physical function, through the musculo-skeletal system, increases the effective operation of the nervous system, which in turn strengthens the workings of the endocrine and immune systems. We have also discovered that post traumatic habituation (peripheral tissue damage or nerve injury), if left untreated or neglected, often leads to pathological pain processes such as chronic headaches, loss of muscle strength, muscle spasm and loss of flexibility in movement. These processes result in a feedback loop of chronic degenerative musculo-skeletal syndromes which can be effectively treated when addressed in a timely manner. By restoring function, chiropractic frees up one's energy, releasing one's life force and increasing one's vitality. The benefit of chiropractic treatment is that it harmonizes the body's wireless anatomy: by balancing physical energy. It bestows on the individual the ability to become focused on life, rather than on pain and dysfunction. Restored function provides one with the requisite energy to pursue external goals, express uniqueness, heal adverse conditions and successfully work on inner development. "}
