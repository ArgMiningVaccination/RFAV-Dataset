We study anSIR transmission model with dynamic vaccine demand based on an imitation mechanism where the perceived risk of vaccination is modelled as a function of the incidence of vaccine side eects. The model shows some important dierences compared to previous game dynamic models ofvaccination, and allows noteworthy inferences as regards both the past and future lifetime of vaccination programmes. In particular it is suggested that a huge disproportion between the perceived risk of disease and vaccination is necessary in order to achieve high coverages. This disproportion is further increased in highly industrialised countries. Such considerations represent serious challenges for future vaccination programmes. Keywords: Epidemiological models, vaccination choices, imitation dynamics, vaccine side eects. 1 Introduction Although forms of exemption to vaccination have always existed [23], the \"natural history\" of vaccina- tion programmes, as part of the historical pathway through which humankind progressively rids itselfof infectious diseases, has always been pervaded by a high degree of optimism [5]. However, recently this optimistic view has increasingly been challenged: for example, opposition to the whole-cell per- tussis vaccine the thimerosal case [16], and the MMR scare [20] can be considered evidence that in industrialized countries, the success story of vaccination is feeding back on itself. This is the con- sequence of two dierent processes. On the one hand, the high degree of herd immunity achieved bydecades of successful immunization programmes has reduced the incidence of many infections to neg- ligible levels. On the other hand the large, and increasing, number of vaccines routinely administered every year yields steady flows of vaccine-associated side eects [26], [27]. In the US approximately Corresponding Author 130,000 reports of Vaccine Adverse Events are notied annually, with 10-15% classied as serious [4]. In such circumstances the perception of the public will likely rank the perceived risk of suering a vac- cine side eect (VSE) as much higher than the corresponding risk of infection [1, 2, 6, 7]. A common example is poliomyelitis in industrialized countr ies. For example in Italy during 1980-2000 the number of vaccine-induced polio cases was three times higher than wild polio cases [15]. Under voluntary vac- cination high degrees of herd immunity might therefore incentivise vaccination free riding [3],[21], i.e.the parents' decision not to vaccinate children after comparing the perceived risk of disease and the perceived risk of vaccine side eects [1, 2, 6]. Vaccination free riding [3, 10, 13, 1, 2, 6, 7, 9, 21, 22, 11] makes eradication impossible (unless special contact s tructures are considered [19]) and triggers stable oscillations in the infection prevalence. Previous studies on the impact of vaccination free riding on endemic infections have focused on scenar- ios where the vaccine demand is driven by the time changes in the perceived risk of disease, measured through the current (or past) infection prevale nce. Based on the above-cited literature on VSEs we instead suggest that in industrialized countries, where the incidence of common vaccine preventableinfections is very low, the available information on vaccine side eects might become the main driv- ing force of vaccine demand. The only paper devoted to this issue is [9], where, however, vaccine demand was phenomenologically modelled as a decreasing function of the perceived risk of suering avaccine-associated side eect. The perceived risk of VSEs was in its turn evaluated by the public from available information on current and past trends of side eects attributed to the vaccine. In this paper we shift the focus onto the impact of VSEs on the dynamics of immunization programmes for endemicinfections, using an SIR transmission model with voluntary vaccination choice. Vaccination choices are described by an evolutionary game as in [2], where the vaccine uptake p(t) is determined by an imitation process between agents (the parents of the children to be vaccinated) who are divided into \"vaccinators\" and \"non-vaccinators\". However, in [2] the perceived payo of the \"non-vaccinators\" is proportional to the prevalence of the disease, whereas the payo of \"vaccinators\" is constant, i.e.independent of VSEs. The novelty of the present work is that the payo of \" vaccinators\" is proportional to the incidence of vaccine-associated side eects. In turn, this incidence is assumed to be proportional to the actual vaccine uptake. We believe that this model represents a more appropriate description of the future evolution of immunization programmes in voluntary vaccination regimes. Indeed, the fact that avail- able information on vaccine side eects might become the main driving force of vaccine demand is strongly supported by the empirical evidence, e.g. the case of England and Wales, where due to the MMR scare [20], rst dose measles uptake fell for several years from 94% to about 75%. Comparedto [2] we also expand our basic model to include (a) nonlinear perceived costs of infection; (b) the possibility that the perceived costs of infection and vaccination are evaluated by the public using past values of state variables, for examp le due to information delay [7] or tothe perception of long-term vaccine side eects [9]. 2 Materials and Methods 2.1 Dynamic vaccine demand and vaccine side eects We consider a family of models of the spread of a non-fatal SIR infection controlled by voluntary vac- cination with a \"perfect\" vaccine administered in a single dose at birth and giving life-long immunity: S/prime=(1p)SSI (1) I/prime=SI(+)I susceptible and pthe vaccinated proportion among newborn children; >0,>0,>0 denote the transmission, the mortality and the recovery rates. We assume that, in absence of vaccination, the disease is endemic, i.e. R0=/(+)>1. The dynamics of pobeys a learning by imitation [14] process where k1is the \"imitation\" coecient 2and switching between the decisions to vaccinate or not to vaccinate, is determined by the payo gain E(t). The latter is given by the dierence between the perceived payo of vaccinators V(t), where V(t) is the perceived risk of suering a VSE, and the perceived payo of non-vaccinators: I(t), where I(t) is the perceived risk of suering serious illness due to infection. We note that, irrespective of the specic forms of E(t), the family of models (1-2-3) has the following three equilibria: (i) an unstable disease-free equilibrium with no The stability of BandCand the existence of further equilibria depend on the specic types of the payo gain. Modelling of the dynamics of pby an imitation game was introduced by Bauch in the seminal paper [2], where a specic model of the family (1-2-3) was where: payo of non-vaccinators is proportional to t h ei n f e c t i v ep r e v a l e n c e I(t):I(t)=rImI(t), where mI(t) is an estimate of the current risk of infection, and rIis the risk of serious disease as a consequence of infection. Hence: E(t)=rImI(t)rV=rV(I(t)1), where =mrI/rVis proportional to the relative cost of the non-vaccinator strategy. In Bauch's model the Bequilibrium is unstable and there is a equilibrium: the the stability/instability of Ddepends on the product k1(0). The assumption in [2] that the perceived risk of VSEs V(t) is constant can be justied if the public correctly evaluates this risk as the ratio between total VSEs per unit time, given by (N)p(t) ((0,1)) where Nis the total population size (so that Nis the yearly number of births), and the per-capita probability of incurring a VSE during a single vaccine administration, and the total number of vaccinations administered for that specic disease Np(t). We instead suppose that the public evaluates the risk of VSEs by using the available information on the total number of vaccine- associated side eects, or, which is equivalent, on the ratio between the total number of vaccine associated side eects and the total number of newborn children per unit of time. We therefore set: V(t)=p(t)( 4 ) The implication of (4) is that periods of large vaccine uptake negatively feed back, through an increase in the incidence of VSEs, into the proportion of parents favourable to vaccination. We model the perceived risk of infection as an increasing function h1(\u00b7)0 of the information index M, introduced in [6, 7], that summarizes the publicly available information on the infection: I(t)=h1(M(t)). (5) The index M, used by agents to evaluate the risk of infection, may model not only current, but also past information. The case h1(0)>0 accounts for the scenario where the disease is locally eliminated but disease re-emergence by external reintroduction is feared. In the simplest case, the information index M(t) is related to the current prevalence of the infection as follows: M(t)=h2(I(t)), (6) where h2(\u00b7)>0a n d h/prime 2(\u00b7)>0. Using the dynamics of be written as follows: p/prime=k(h(I)p)p(1p)( 7 ) where h(I)=1h1(h2(I)),k=k1. First, note that from: p/primek(h(0)p)p(1p) it follows that h(0)1p(t)1, so that we shall not consider this trivial case. On the contrary, if h(0)<1t h e n p(t)h(0) holds asymptotically, i.e. the collective coverage will at least reach the minimal level h(0). Symmetrically, inequality 3p/primekhMaxp(1p)m e a n st h a t p(t) is bounded by a logistic dynamics with kinetics constant khMax. Finally, if imitation dynamics is faster than the infection time scale: k> > (+)1,t h e n p(t)i sa t quasi-equilibrium: p(t)min (h(M(t)),1), (8) which is the phenomenological relationship rst proposed in [6]. 2.2 The importance of time delays The assumption that Edepends only on current values of Iandpis an approximation. For example agents might perceive that vaccines are responsible for VSEs arising with long time delays [9], asmight be the case with auto-immune diseases [18]. Moreover, delays of dierent nature, concerning the information on the spread of the disease, may involve both p(t)a n d M(t)[ 6 ] .T h u si nt h ec a s ei n which the perceived risk of vaccination is evaluated on past VSEs: V(t)=/integraldisplayt QH(Tv)p(tTv)dTv (9) where QHis a delay kernel. An important kernel is the exponentially fading memory :QH(x)= bexp(bx),b>0, which allows reduction to ODE since it holds that: /prime V=b(p(t)V). (10) Scenarios such as long-term VSEs may require die rent kernels, more concentrated on past periods, such as the Erlang functions: Anxn1exp(bx), also allowing reduction to ODEs. 3R e s u l t s 3.1 Endemic equilibria and their stability In this section we shall investigate the model (1)-(2)-(7) where no delays are present. Considering a generic h(I), the system (1)-(2)-(7) has three equilibrium points A(unstable), B(unstable) and C, which, unlike [2], is always unstable since the linearized equation for preads /prime=kh(ISIR). Moreover, two further equilibria are induced by the specic Ewe introduced: A disease-free equilibrium with positive the equation: h(I)=1R1 0+ I. (11) Remark 3.1 The equilibrium Ebehis equal to the endemic equilibrium of the model studied in [9], where, however, pis not a state variable. Since all equilibria are independent of k, which is an epidemiologically relevant parameter (we re- call that it is proportional to the imitation coecient k1determining the time-scales of the imitation phenomenon), this makes it natural to choose kas a bifurcation parameter. Our main results (demon- irrespective of the imitation speed k; 4B)On the contrary, if Ieh/prime(Ie)>(+Ie)/parenleftBig (+Ie)+2/radicalbig Ie(+)/parenrightBig (13) holds then there are two positive 1such that: 1. If h e Ebehis C)In the case k(k1,k2) the orbits x(t)=(S(t),I(t),p(t)) are oscillatory in the sense of Yabu- covich [25]. This intuitively means that for suciently large tall state variables are permanently oscillating, with regular or irregular oscillations. Formally, for j=1,2,3 it holds that: minlim t+xj(t)<m asymptotically stable (GAS); if h0<pcthenEdf eis unstable. Remark 3.2 Note that, on dividing both the r.h.s. and the l.h.s. of (13) by Ie,a f t e r trivial calculations we obtain that to have Hopf bifurcation at Ebehthe derivative of hat Iehas to be at least of order O(/radicalbig /). Remark 3.3 Property Dshows that, unlike [2], elimination is possible in our model, although only if in absence of the disease the vaccinator payo is so large as to yield a vaccine uptake greater than the elimination threshold. To better understand the phenomenon of epidemic oscillations driven by vaccination choice we compare the above results with the recent literature on this subject. Unlike [2] where large values of k(0) induce sustained oscillations around the endemic state, in our model oscillations are possible in an intermediate window of values of the imitation coecient k. This means that both slow and fast imitation are stabilizing forces. Moreover, we note that the stability condition (12) has the same formal structure as that of the delayed model in [6], where dependence of the current vaccine uptake on past prevalence of the infection was required to obtain oscillations. Indeed, imitation is a (nonlinear) adjustment process introducing a delay , whose characteristic time scales are determined by the speed with which the vaccine uptake reacts to changes in the payo gain. Heuristically, close to the equilibrium eq. (7) becomes: p/primekh(Ie)(1h(Ie)) (h(I)p)=( h(I)p) (14) which may be read as an exponentially fading memory mechanism with average delay 1 /. This suggests a route to estimate the elusive imitation coecient k, by preliminarily estimating the average delay 1 /. Finally, we note that the Yabucovitch oscillatority is a global result, unlike the Hopf bifurcation theorem, which is local. Although the nature (periodic, quasi-periodic or chaotic) of Yabucovitchoscillations cannot be determined a priori, this makes the predictions of our model very general. Finally, it is easy to show that the inclusion of time delays does not aect the location and stability of equilibria A,B,CandE df e, whereas the stability of Ebehmay be aected, as seen in the numerical simulations below (see also the Appendix ). 3.2 Analysis of selected subcases We report numerical illustrations of noteworthy sub-cases of epidemiological interest. The basic reproduction number R0is set to 10; the recovery rate is set to either =0.1days1(pertussis) or =( 1/7)days1(measles), which correspond to an average duration of the infectious period of respectively 10 days(pertussis) and one week (measles). Finally the life expectancy L=1/is xed either at L=5 0years (used in [2] to more closely reproduce UK pertussis data) or at L=7 5years, which is more representative of mortality in modern industrialized countries. 53.2.1 The basic unlagged model: the case of linear h(I) at Ebehis: Ie=Ie()=11 1+ +(15) As regards the stability of Ebeh, it is of interest to assess the relative role of the two main behavioral parameters introduced by our model: andk. By applying (13) it is easy to show that a exists such that for >then (13) is fullled and the two branches k1()a n d k2() of the bifurcation c u r v ei nt h es p a c e( k,) exist and are analytically computable. Below the equilibrium Ebehis (at least) locally stable. For example in the case =0.1days1,=1/50years1it is (,k)(280,0.042), from which the two branches k1()a n d k2() of the Hopf curve depart. For = 1000 (implying Ie=3.18\u00d7104 andpe=0.32) we obtain k1 2=4.75daysandk1 1= 312 daysa range dicult to interpret. However, the heuristic average imitation delay 1 / correspondingly ranges between three weeks and about four years, close to the values found in [6]. The bifurcation curve in the ( k,)a n d( k1,) parametric spaces are shown in Fig. 1. 3.2.2 The basic unlagged model: the case of linear-ane h(I) The case h(I)=0+Iis of interest since it assumes that even in scenarios of zero prevalence agents perceive a positive risk 0of infection re-emergence. We get: Ie()=1R1 00 1+ +,pe()=0+1R1 00 1+ + Thus the perception of such a risk has a positive eect on equilibrium uptake. The dependence of the bifurcation curve on 0may be non-monotone, as in the right-hand panel of Fig. 1. 4 Substantive implications of vaccine side eects for vaccina- tion programmes 4.1 The epidemiological transition and vaccination payo We use equilibrium results from the simple case of linear h(I) to explore the impact of human progress on the natural history of vaccination programmes. Note that in the parametric set we are considering thedimensionless quantity /ranges from about 1826 (pertussis in a population with low life- expectancy) up to about 3913 (measles in a populatio n with high life-expectancy). Thus, achieving a large equilibrium uptake requires very large , i.e. of the order of /.S i n c e =rIm/,i t follows that to achieve large equilibrium uptakes for measles or pertussis, the perceived cost of serious disease has to be at least three order of magnitude higher than the perceived cost of VSE. Thoughthis seems surprising, we feel it is consistent with what was still observed at the beginning of the 20th century, when the risk of serious sequelae following measles or scarlet fever was extremely large (100- 250 deaths per 100000 cases of disease), and the absence of vaccines was keeping the risk of infection very high. In such circumstances even a large probability of suering a VSE from a vaccine could have been tolerated by the community. This also suggests that industrialized countries could face serious diculties in maintaining high vaccine uptake in the future. Indeed, completion of the epidemiological transition [24], i.e. the historic change in the cause composition of mortality in industrialized countries from infectious and nutritional diseases to chronic-degenerative ones, led to a dramatic fall in the levels of serious morbidity and mortality 6from all infectious diseases. Together with the current higher-than-ever degrees of herd immunity allowed by decades of sustained vaccination, this has reduced the perceived risks of serious disease from most infections to negligible levels. Finally, as regards the role played by life expectancy on the steady state Ebeh, our results suggest that the achievement of a given equilibrium uptake in industrialized countries (i.e. with a very high life expectancy) requires a much larger value of compared to developing countries. This is consistent with the fact that in regimes with low mortality (also as a consequence o f vaccinations), agents demand a vaccine only if the relative risks of suering a VSE are very low. We stress that our predictions are equilibrium ones based on a simple deterministic model with homogeneous mixing. Nonetheless more realistic models would not substantially aect them. 4.2 Simulations In our simulations we set h(I)=Iand, to better emphasize our main messages, we allow immigra- tion of infectives, according to two dierent hypotheses: a)a small constant transfer Imm from the susceptible to the infective state, representing a steady flow of infections as a consequence of interna- tional travelling; b)a few new infections appear at some stage once and for all, in order to mimic the possibility of infection resurgence. Indeed, in the oscillatory regime the infection prevalence I(t)m a y reach extremely low values, which calls into question the appropriateness of a deterministic model. This drawback is avoided by assumption a,a l s ou s e di n[ 2 ] . Imm is set to one infective individual per week in a population of 5 \u00d7106individuals. 4.2.1 The basic unlagged model We rst assess the impact of VSEs on the transient i nfection dynamics triggered by a new vaccination introduced at the pre-vaccination endemic state, and under assumption a. The vaccine is introduced at time t= 0, with initial vaccine uptake set to 0 .95>pc. Vaccine side eects occur from the beginning of the programme. We set = 15000 (implying pe0.71,k=0.002days1and 1 /7years). Note that kis small since it is the product between the natural imitation rate and the low probability of suering a VSE. As predicted by (13), the syst em converges, in epidemiologically reasonable time scales, to a stable limit cycle. With reference to Fig. 2, the vaccine uptake (right-hand panel) starts declining soon after the programme starts, due to the onset of VSEs, and falls below the criticalthreshold p cin less than four years. Thus the eective reproduction number RE(t)=R0S(t)( l e f t - hand panel) initially declines but then increases and exceeds the unit threshold at t8years, yielding a new epidemic outbreak at t10years. During this rather long 'honey-moon' period the circulation of the infection is essentially sustained by immigration. Note that p(t)>pcfor a rather long period of time (about 36 per cent of total time). During such periods routine vaccination surveys would reveal a satisfactorily high coverage. Therefore they could not explain the endemic persistence of infection. The role played by kis illustrated in Fig. 3, which considers the values: k=0.0005days1,k= 0.002days1(as before), k=0.0035days1, and which shows uptake is not signicantly aected by kand close to pe;ii)both the amplitude of oscillations of p(t)a n d the fraction of total time where p(t)>pcincrease in k;iii)the duration of the period between the start of the programme and a new epidemic outbreak is decreasing in k. For example, the 'low' k value ( k=0.0005days1) yields oscillations that are of small amplitude and that for a small portion of their period are such that p(t)>pc. Moreover, there is an interval of 17 years about before a new epidemics, which is only a few years long for k=0.0035days1. This is the consequence of the slow spread of information occurring for low k, which slows down the reactivity of the vaccine uptake to changes in the payo gain. Note that if no external infections are introduced, then for smallkthe infection prevalence is close to zero. This suggests that oscillations might produce stochastic elimination of infection. We now study the introduction of a new vaccine for which no vaccine side eects are initially known.In this case it seems reasonable to assume that an intermediate period might exist during which no perception of VSEs arises. We consider =0f o r t<t 1where t1=1 0years, and that the starting point is the pre-vaccination steady state. Of course, the vaccine uptake start increasing since the payo 7vaccination is initially positive ( = 0). If VSEs raise after a very long time, or no VSEs are reported, then stochastic elimination is possible. By contrast, if evidence of VSEs emerges, the scenario reduces straightaway to the cases treated above. If the imitation process is very slow, VSEs appear before reaching a sucient coverage and a sub-optimal vaccination coverage is achieved (left-hand panel of Fig. 4). Instead for a larger value of k, the infective fraction is very close to 0 such that stochastic elimination may occur (central panel of Fig. 4). Finally, for an intermediate range of kthere is onset of oscillations, but at the end of their transitory the minimum I(t) is very close to 0 and elimination can again occur (right-hand panel of Fig. 4). Finally, we simulated the case where eradication was achieved thanks to a period of compulsoryvaccination, after which vaccination becomes voluntary. In this case VSEs induce individuals to switch to the 'non-vaccinator' strategy, thereby producing a decrease in vaccination coverage. This in turn increases the probability of infection re-emergence from imported cases. If a few new external infections are introduced (assumption b)b e f o r e R E(t) = 1, then the occurrence or not of stochastic transient elimination depends again on k, with patterns similar to the previous case (see Fig. 5.a,5.b). Moreover, if individuals take into account a non zero risk of infection re-emergence from importation (the linear ane case h(I)=0+I), the population is more 'protected' and the impact of the external infections can be reduced also for large values of k(see Fig. 5.c). 4.2.2 Impact of information-related delays An exponentially distributed lag in the pterm yields a model given by (1)-(2) complemented by: p/prime=k(h(I)H))p(1p) (16) and by (10). Fig. 6 reports the stability regions in the ( k,b)p l a n ef o r = 260, 279.5( w h i c hi s close to the critical value in absence of delays) and = 500. Note that for = 500 >for all b there are two values kl(b;)a n d kr(b;) such that for kl(b;)<k<k r(b;) the endemic state Ebeh is unstable and it is also an easy matter to show that Yabucovitch oscillations can arise. Similar plots are obtained in all cases where >. This can be easily explained since for very large bthe lagged model reduces to the unlagged one that, for >, has an instability interval. Interestingly, the right panel of 6 for = 260 <shows instability regions that are uniquely due to the information delay, because in absence of the delay (i.e. for large b) there is no instability, as shown in the previous sub-sections. This conrms that the addition of time delays in the pterm (mimicking delayed onset of VSEs or delayed information acquisition) cumulates with the imitation delay in triggering instabilities. Fig. 7 reports the time course of vaccine uptake p(t)f o r= 260 for two distinct cases. In the left-hand panel the behaviour in absence of delay is reported, showing convergence to the endemic state. The right-hand panel reports the behaviour for a delay of 250 days (b=0.004days1) in the occurrence of side eects, showing instead convergence to a limit cycle. Let us now consider an exponentially fading memory in the perceived risk of infection: let Mstand for past prevalence, and athe corresponding delaying rate. We set h1(M)=M,a n d h2(I)=I.I n Fig. 8 we plotted the stability regions in the ( k,a)p l a n ef o r = 260, 279.5 (which is close to the critical value )a n d = 500. Finally, in the case where exponentially fading memories appear both in the perceived risk of vacci- nation (with rate b) and the perceived risk of infection (with rate a), numerical simulations showed a wide pattern of periodic behaviour, including very long periods (an example with alternating low and high peaks is reported in the left-hand panel of Fig. 9), and also aperiodicity (as in the right-handpanel of Fig. 9) 5 Concluding remarks We investigated an SIR transmission model with voluntary vaccination. Unlike [2] we consider a dynamic perceived risk of vaccination proportional to the trends of VSEs. Mathematical analysis of the model conrms already known results, such as the onset of behaviour-triggered steady oscillationsabout the post-vaccination endemic state. In addition it shows some noteworthy dierences compared 8to ndings elsewhere. For example global elimination may, or may not, be possible depending on the actual magnitude of the baseline perceived risk of disease relative to the risk of vaccine side eects. As regards the pre-vaccination equilibrium, dierently from [2], it is always unstable, so that any vaccination programme will initially be successful, at least partially. Moreover oscillations occur, provided the relative risk of disease is large enough, in a bounded window of the imitation parameter. In addition, we also considered the impact of time delays on the vaccination payo gain,which is a realistic feature. Finally, the model allows noteworthy inferences on the future lifetime of vaccination voluntary programmes. It suggests that in order to achieve high equilibrium uptakes for e.g. measles, the perceived cost of the disease must be at least three orders of magnitude higherthan the perceived cost of vaccine-associated side e ects, and moreover that this requirement is further increased under situations with large life expectancies. Both these facts seem to be consistent with real world observations, and suggest that maximal vaccination eort by international institutions should target increasing vaccine uptake in less developed countries where the risk of serious sequelae is still high, and life expectancy is still low. Simulations nally provide further interesting insights on theeect of behavioural parameters on vaccine uptake.

Thus we may apply the Yabucovitch theorem [25]. Property D Since asymptotically p(t)h(0), for large times: i.e. Edf eis GAS. Let us now discuss the case of an exponentially fading memory in the perceived risk of vaccination with linear h(I)=I. The Routh-Hurwitz stability condition reads: G(,b)=c2(b)2+c1(b) +c0(b)>0 (20) 9where is as in eq. (17), and the coecients are third order polynomials in the delay parameter b. Thus, for each bthere are at most two bifurcation values for k, whereas for each kthere may be at most three bifurcation values for b.
