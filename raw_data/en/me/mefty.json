It took the form of a 12-part series on complementary medicine. This is the same BMJ that 20 years ago declared, in a dismissive editorial, that alternative medicine \"ought to be as extinct as divination by examination of bird's entrails\". The BMJ series was a belated recognition of a victory by a ragged guerrilla army that, starting far beyond the medical pale, has gradually marched on the capital and is now sitting around the tables with the generals of the medical empire, discussing exactly how many positions it will have in the new government. Today, every high street has its health-food shop, and it's hard to open a newspaper or a magazine without finding a cure that involves mega doses of vitamin C, a stress-reducing massage or a tincture of St John's Wort. We can buy soya snack bars that claim to fight off both prostate cancer and the menopause, eat ginkgo biloba-enriched crisps that boost the flow of blood to the head, and relax in the evening with a couple of tabs of (perfectly legal) kava kava. So how has it happened? How have the health irregulars - homoeopaths with their weird belief in minuscule doses, acupuncturists locating undetectable meridians, and herbalists mired in the Middle Ages - conspired to storm one of the great professional citadels? Scientific medicine now seems like some fallen empire. Despite all its pharmacological weaponry and coffers stacked with gold, it is having to make peace with bands of amiable civilians. What is this going to do to our health? Is it a good thing, or have we succumbed to a dreadful delusion? Part of the explanation lies with Clara, and the hundreds of thousands like her, who found that modern medicine wasn't providing what she wanted, so, sophisticated shopper that she is, took her business elsewhere. A 48-year-old freelance accountant, Clara had gone to her GP complaining of being tired and irritable. She was working very hard and also putting on weight. He prescribed hormone-replacement therapy (HRT). Then she developed irritable-bowel syndrome and was offered steroids. So she went to see the naturopath, Elizabeth Gray Gibaud, who has a practice at the Hale Clinic in London, and specialises in \"face diagnosis\". \"A particular puffiness beneath the eyes suggested problems with her colon, and a strong cubical fold below the tip of her nose, plus a reddish-brown colour, suggested trouble in the region of her womb,\" says Gibaud. \"A different colouring around her mouth indicated a mineral deficiency, which checked out when I asked about rough skin.\" So Clara went on a detox diet for six weeks. She found she had various food allergies - to coffee, red wine and wheat - and she took a range of herbs, vitamin supplements and minerals. It was a big success: \"I've lost about two-and-a-half stone, my son says I'm a different person, and I'm happier and have more energy than ever before.\" This is precisely the sort of thing that orthodox medicine (OM) has for years been lumping with divination. Mere anecdote, say the hardliners, and if the regimen does have an effect then it is probably as a placebo - if you believe that you will get better, then you probably will, however cranky the treatment you get. Where are the clinical trials that show the value of this treatment on a controlled group? What is the active ingredient in the herbs? Large doses of vitamins are just a way of producing expensive urine. But the Claras took no notice. Guerrilla armies depend on popular support and, while the establishment jeered, the patients voted with their wallets. Five million to nine million of us in the UK use complementary medicine (CM) regularly; two years ago (the last date for which figures are available) at least 15 million CM consultations took place. Faced with this widespread dissatisfaction among its patients, the tone of the medical empire became more shrill. Here is Dr Eric Rose, of the British Medical Association, responding to a report in 1998 that there were now more complementary practitioners than GPs in the UK: \"My main concern is the dogma surrounding this type of medicine. You see some ridiculous claims - eat six tins of stewed rhubarb and you will get better.\" In-house magazines felt free to be even more disparaging, employing a little racism along the way: \"Medications of the mysterious East\" is how a columnist writing in Doctor magazine recently described Chinese herbal treatments for eczema. They were, he wrote, \"the inscrutable Dr Fu ManChu's magic eczema potion\". The echoes of other empires that ignored a rising tide of demand and suffered for it can be heard all too clearly: British Telecom before privatisa tion, British Airways in the face of the smaller and nimbler Virgin, IBM ignoring the threat of the PC. But the CM irregulars weren't just supplying a need; their style chimed perfectly with wider social changes. The consumer revolution and the rise of the entrepreneur, although possibly distasteful to many of the practitioners personally, meshed perfectly with their philosophy. A greater concern with the body beautiful brought a greater concern with personal health. It was a small step from the fixed weights and the treadmill to vitamins and supplements. What was going on in the gyms and juice bars marched in step with one of the big ideas in medicine in the 80s and early 90s - the link between lifestyle and heart disease. But while OM, in the authoritarian style of the industrial giants of the past, instructed the nation to cut back on fat, the CM irregulars offered a personal service: just as mail-shots target particular postcodes, or loyalty cards enable supermarkets to track your personal spending patterns, so they could satisfy the Claras by tailoring a package for each one. \"Complementary medicine has definitely been piggy-backing on the rise of consumer power,\" says Andrew Vickers, author of the BMJ series and director of research at the Research Council for Complementary Medicine. \"People are changing the way they relate to authority figures. The doctor is there to serve you, just as banks and the phone service are.\" CM practitioners also tapped into one of the greatest sources of medical power since ancient times. Until five years ago, doctors had a lock on medical information. Even though your rash never seemed to clear up or your joints remained painfully stiff, the local doctor was the only one who could diagnose the problem and provide a remedy. That all changed with the advent of the internet. Suddenly, a wealth of information on every condition imaginable was just a few clicks of a mouse away. Within hours, if you were determined enough, you could know more than your GP about the causes of those blinding headaches and possible remedies. What's more, on the net, the divisions between orthodox and complementary vanish: every treatment is just one of dozens that come up in the window of your search engine. Of course, there are dangers, and misinformation is a problem, but OM's secret weapon, omniscience, had been disabled. The medical establishment has always liked to claim that its expertise is based on scientific evidence. Treatments are tested and based on the most rigorous research, so the story goes, while beyond their orthodoxy is the world of cranks and charlatans, making wild claims, relying on mere anecdote. \"The greatest appeal of complementary medicine is not scientific or practical,\" argues Marcia Agnell, editor of the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine and a long-time opponent of alternative medicine. \"It is religious. Like most religions, it has charismatic personalities, who instead of doing research or publishing in scientific journals, promote their beliefs in books for the public, largely composed of inspirational testimonials.\" But the struggle between the establishment and the health irregulars has not just been a war of words. In the US, the Federal Drugs Administration (FDA) has a long history of taking legal action against those practising CM. In 1962, for instance, a Vermont grandmother was taken to court for selling yeast to pregnant women and making health claims for it in a leaflet. And in 1992, the consulting rooms of a nutritionist and doctor Jonathan Wright were raided by armed police officers and FDA officials who took away vitamin and mineral supplements. Others have been arrested while lecturing about vitamins, and nutritionists have been put under electronic surveillance. The FDA has also targeted alternative cancer treatments, while a Committee on Quackery, set up by the American Medical Association (AMA) in 1964, specifically denounced a form of spinal manipulation known as chiropractic. In 1987, a court found the AMA guilty of conspiring to destroy the profession of chiropractic. In Britain, an equally virulent campaign against CM practitioners has been conducted, largely through the media. It peaked about a decade ago when OM mounted what can now be seen as a desperate rearguard action. In 1989, the Campaign Against Health Fraud (CAHF), later renamed HealthWatch, was set up. Modelled on the self-styled \"quackbusters\" of the American National Council Against Health Fraud, its stated aim was to protect the sick and vulnerable from being exploited by ruthless quacks, peddling unproven and useless or dangerous cures. Its launch was marked by a newspaper article alleging, with no evidence, that \"a growing number of women were dying of breast cancer because they were putting themselves in the hands of quacks rather than orthodox specialists\". In his remarkably detailed book, Dirty Medicine, which exhaustively chronicles this time, Martin Walker claims that many of those involved in the campaign were linked in various ways with the large pharmaceutical and food companies, which had a vested interest in demolishing any alternative medical approaches that threatened their supremacy. Walker alleges that talk about scientific testing and rigour was actually a cloak for a far more commercial agenda. He shows how the most relentless rubbishing of alternatives - and the character-assassination of practitioners that went with it - occurred during the years that the Aids drug AZT was being trialled in the UK between the late 80s and 1992. The organisers of an Aids-information group, Positive Health, for instance, were attacked for \"exploiting people with Aids\". Their crime? Providing a forum to discuss orthodox and alternative treatments, and to organise workshops that taught basic meditation and provided information on diet and vitamins. At the same time, attempts by perfectly respectable scientists to set up proper trials of promising herbal or supplement-based Aids treatments were rejected out of hand. Perhaps the most compelling example that what was going on was not a battle between science and superstition, but one between establishment power and would-be reformers, is what happened to the Bristol Cancer Help Centre. Based on the idea that your best chance of living with, or even surviving, cancer lay with a healthy, effective immune system, the centre advocated an organic, largely vegetarian diet. By the mid-80s, it was confident enough to agree to a clinical trial of its effectiveness by the Imperial Cancer Research Fund. This looked like one of the few serious attempts to test an alternative approach, yet it proved to be the basis of yet another highly damaging and totally irresponsible assault. In 1990, with maximum publicity, the Lancet published some \"interim\" results, based on data from only 18 months of a study supposed to last five years. Its devastating conclusion was that women who had been treated with the Bristol Cancer Help Centre's diet were, in fact, twice as likely to die as those who received conventional treatment. The press had a field-day. Headlines such as \"Danger in a veggie cure for cancer\" and \"Double death risk at veg diet cancer clinic\" filled the papers. Over the succeeding weeks, it became clear that the interim report was seriously flawed. Nearly one-third of the patients classified as having been treated at Bristol had visited the centre only once and had not been on any special diet. Even the OM journal, Hospital Doctor, declared the study \"a fraud\". Eventually, the authors of the report themselves wrote to say they regretted \"that their paper created the impression that the Bristol regime worsened patients' chances\", but the damage had been done and the credibility of the centre was almost destroyed. The evidence is overwhelming that CAHF and its allies were not interested in exploring the scientific basis of such CM approaches as focusing on the role of food allergies in chronic disorders. A considerable body of respectable research supports this approach, known as clinical ecology. Yet the 1990 World In Action investigation into Breakspear Hospital, which specialised in allergies, ignored it all and instead concentrated on the cost of treatment and quoted OM experts who claimed the patients were deluded. The programme relied heavily on CAHF sources. The reaction of the patients involved in all this is very revealing. Instead of thanking the OM spokesmen for saving them from exploitation, in the wake of the attacks on both the Bristol Centre and Breakspear, they formed support committees and tried to get media coverage to put their side of the story. Aids activists forced many conventional doctors in the field to rethink the whole idea of clinical trials and this, too, was a major factor in CM's eventual success. It is against this background that the often-repeated charge that CM is potentially dangerous needs to be examined. Hardline medics regularly tar all CM treatments with the same sceptical brush. While some do require a leap of faith - personally, I find the use of crystals unbelievable, and many theories, such as the idea that high doses of vitamins C and E reduce the risk of strokes, are unproven - the evidence for others is increasingly impressive. It has been slow in coming, for reasons discussed below, but in clinical trials comparing drug and herb treatments, for instance, some herbs have been coming out on top. St John's Wort, for example, has been proven to be as good as pharmaceutical anti-depressants for mild depression - notwithstanding recent concern that there may be dangers in taking it in conjunction with conventional medicines; there is evidence that large doses of the mineral selenium can protect against cancer; and children brought up in a Rudolf Steiner vegetarian community, where they are not treated with drugs or vaccinated, had 40% fewer allergies. There is a strong whiff of hypocrisy in OM's assertion of high scientific principles: its own record of untested and dangerous treatment dwarfs anything achieved by CM. Indeed, according to Dr Ian Chalmers of the UK Cochrane Centre, set up to test medical procedures, about 60% of standard OM treatments have never been subject to proper trials. A dramatic example occurred in September last year, when it was revealed that the conventional treatment for patients with severe shock or burns - albumin - which has been used for the past 30 years, caused an estimated 1,200 extra deaths a year in the UK. An even more shocking departure from the gold standards of science was exposed in October 1999, when we learned of the problems that can follow from not publishing the negative results from clinical trials - a basic scientific requirement. According to Dr Chalmers, had the negative results on the heart drug lorcainide been published at the time, up to 80,000 deaths in the US in the 80s could have been prevented. Meanwhile, the CM camp is trying to establish firm evidence for its claim to treat successfully many of the chronic conditions - such as skin problems, auto-immune disorders and malfunctioning of the gut - with which OM seems to have a particularly poor track record. An estimated 4,000 randomised trials of CM treatments have been carried out, not all to a very high standard, but the number is doubling every five years and the design is improving. In the US, the National Centre for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, part of the National Institutes of Health, has a $50-million research budget and last year funded 43 studies, including one investigating the effectiveness of acupuncture in treating alcoholics and another on the value of melatonin in treating Parkinson's disease. There is a very good reason why CM is far more poorly researched than OM: money. The NHS spends roughly 85p on investigating CM for every \u00a3100 it spends on conventional medical research, while pharmaceu- tical companies, the other main source of funding, are not interested in testing the effectiveness of, say, garlic in cutting down heart disease or how diet can lower blood pressure, because they can't take out a patent on it. It is easy to see a conspiracy here, and it's true that, until CM began to gain popularity, the medical profession tended to the view that it was a waste of time to test its treatments. There is a deeper organisational problem, too. \"Unlike doctors in big NHS hospitals,\" says Andrew Vickers of the Research Council for Complementary Medicine, \"alternative practitioners have no research back up. In an NHS hospital, you have not only a ready supply of patients to put into trials, but also a department specifically devoted to research, with statisticians, secretaries, computers, photocopying and so on. So, even if the alternative practitioners do have the training and the inclination to write up research proposals and calculate the statistics, which most of them don't, they still face a big handicap.\" Despite these practical difficulties, a new style of medicine is emerging that aims to cherry-pick the best of both OM and CM. Dubbed integrated medicine, this is the CM practitioners' third name-change in as many decades, each reflecting a change in their status. During the wilderness years, they were alternative; then, as they won some recognition, they turned complementary; now, pushing for a merger, they've become integrated. \"Of course we need to run trials to find out what works best,\" says Dr Mosarif Ali, director of the Integrated Medical Centre in London, \"but we also need to reconnect medicine to its roots. The body is more than just a piece of bio-engineering, and there is more to healing than prescribing drugs.\" So at Ali's clinic, as in many others, you'll get antibiotics, if you really need them, but you'll also get a package of dietary changes, exercise, lifestyle advice and massage. \"Just that package alone clears up 80% of cases,\" Dr Ali claims. However, if it doesn't work on its own, you'll be offered a CM treatment that best fits you and your problem. \"If you had stomach pains,\" he says, \"you might be treated conventionally for a peptic ulcer, but an acupuncturist might treat you for 'deficient liver Qi' and a homoeopath for a 'pulsatilla constitution'.\" Like a medical Luther, Ali is calling for a return to the original medical text. Back to Hippocrates. \"He taught that doctors should fortify the body so that its natural healing power becomes more effective,\" he says. \"Modern medicine has been so blinded by powerful drugs, increasingly minute measurements of cell activity, enzyme levels and suchlike, that it has forgotten the basics.\" Only a few CM diehards would claim that the complementary approach is suitable for every condition. If you are in a car crash, you don't need aromatherapy or echinacea to boost your immune system; you need a casualty ward, heart monitors, anaesthetics and people with a good knowledge of blood chemistry. If your kidneys pack up, you need dialysis and a transplant, and if you develop meningitis, you need antibiotics, fast. But OM's very success - and scientific medicine is undoubtedly one of the triumphs of the past hundred years - can blind us to just what a new kid on the block it is. Just 60 years ago, before the second world war, doctors were pretty impotent. They could make a careful diagnosis and say what the likely outcome was, but, after that, nature was pretty much allowed to take her course. About the only effective remedies in the pre-war OM medicine cabinet were aspirin from willow bark for rheumatic fever, digoxin from foxglove for heart conditions, immunisation for some infections, and salvarsin for syphilis. Meanwhile, children died from diseases such as polio, diphtheria and whooping cough, and adults succumbed to various infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, or puerperal fever, which killed 1,000 women a year in childbirth. Then, within an astonishing 40 years - roughly between 1930 and 1970 - this bleak situation was transformed. Medical breakthroughs dating from that era include penicillin, pap smears for cervical cancer, kidney dialysis, general anaesthesia with curare, cortisone, a cure for tuberculosis, open heart surgery, polio vaccination, the contraceptive pill, hip replacement, kidney transplants, heart transplants and the cure of childhood cancer. \"Magic bullets came cascading out of the lab,\" writes medical journalist James Le Fanu in his recent book, The Rise And Fall Of Modern Medicine, that surveys this period. It was the very success of that revolution that created the conditions that allowed CM to flourish. For instance, two of the stars of those post-war breakthroughs - antibiotics and cortisone - have now come to symbolise much that is wrong with conventional medicine. Antibiotics were undoubtedly a miraculous discovery, vanquishing such major killers as septicaemia, meningitis and pneumonia, but their indiscriminate use and the rise of bacterial resistance has diminished their effectiveness. Cortisone at first appeared to be another astonishing breakthrough, providing immediate relief from the inflammation caused by more than 200 diseases, including rheumatoid athritis, asthma, eczema, gut disorders and kidney problems. But now, 50 years after its first use, cortisone is seen as typical of the failure of conventional medicine: it deals with symptoms, not the underlying disease, and it has a range of unpleasant and damaging side-effects. Two more subtle changes at the heart of the scientific revolution have dramatically altered the way doctors think about patients and what treatments to use. Modern medicine rejected the notion that the doctor should be paramount in deciding how a patient should be treated, and instead turned to statistics. Statistical analysis of double blind trials is both the way to tell if a treatment works and to spot the causes of some diseases, such as the link between lung cancer and smoking. Although this approach has had undoubted success, it has not made medicine as rational and scientific as hoped. \"Statistically derived knowledge has consistently shown itself to be unreliable,\" says Le Fanu. \"It's been shown to result in the adoption of ineffective treatments in 32 per cent of cases or rejection of useful treatment in 33 percent.\" Le Fanu is no friend of CM - he dismissively describes it as a treatment for the \"worried well\" - but his diagnosis of what has gone wrong chimes exactly with the more human and individual approach adopted by integrated medicine. \"Scientific progressivism,\" he says, \"has undermined medicine's most important asset - knowledge-based, practical experience.\" Perhaps even more important in terms of alienating patients has been the transformation of the doctor from patient's advisor to scientific investigator. If you wanted to make a name for yourself during conventional medicine's golden post-war period, it was no good just looking after your patients, you had to research. The heroes of the age no longer just treated patients, they studied them to trace the variations in heart rhythms or to plot the chemical changes during liver failure. \"Patients became interesting clinical material,\" says Le Fanu, \"on which an ambitious young doctor could plan his experiments.\" As one doctor confesses: \"A lot of research you do is of no benefit to the patient, and there is a real possibility you can do them harm.\" Much of research undoubtedly paid of in new treatments, but a bond of trust was put in jeopardy, too. So it was that an entirely new approach to medicine - one that undoubtedly brought incalculable benefits in saving lives and reducing suffering - also alienated the doctors from their client base and created a vacuum at the heart of the profession that CM practitioners have now begun to fill. Will the gentle revolution of CM transform medicine as completely as the scientific revolution did half a century ago? For all its current popularity, its hold is far from secure. On the one hand, a counter-revolution from Europe, inhibiting CM, is a very real possibility. The British are allowed to take higher doses of vitamins and supplements than any other Europeans, and the EU has been pushing for standardised vitamin levels for many years - which would mean a big drop in the legal levels here. (This is what may have lain behind the puzzling and hugely controversial decision by the Labour government, soon after coming to power, to propose a ban on over-the-counter sales of vitamin B6 - commonly used to treat PMT - in doses higher than 10mg. The storm was such that the government backed down.) On the other hand, it is conceivable that the new genetics might eventually provide scientific medicine with the fresh supply of magic bullets that it has been promising: growing new personalised body parts, harvesting human antibodies from transgenic pigs, modifying mutated genes to cure disease, and so on. If it does live up to the hype, CM might be sidelined. Yet the deciphering of the human genome, promised for next year, has implications beyond new, improved drugs and surgery. Writer and genetic activist Jeremy Rifkin suggests that the new genetics has the potential to transform CM, too. Even the best run clinical trials of a drug or herb tell you that people in general get better with it, not whether it will benefit me rather than you. \"With a print-out of your genetic structure, medics will know the kind of diseases and disabilities you are susceptible to,\" says Rifkin. \"Now, suppose that we combine that information with all the new genetic knowledge about plants, and apply it to herbal therapies. We could begin to see exactly who would benefit from soy, who might be better helped with vitamin E and so on.\" Others have a less grandiose view: \"I don't think CM will have the impact of antibiotics or vaccination, which completely transformed medicine,\" says Vickers, \"but it could change the way doctors treat some patients. Many GP's regard CM as the perfect way to deal with 'heart-sink' patients - the ones who keep coming back with vague symptoms they can't do anything about. However, treating them with yoga or art therapy or singing can work wonders. Depending on your point of view, this is either simply the placebo effect at work, or it is a way of responding much more appropriately to the needs of the patient.\" CM could also help develop a hi-tech dimension. Already, the Americans are experimenting with herbal medicines in injectable form: electronic devices, as yet untested, that run weak electronic currents through the body, will, it is hoped, identify a broad spectrum of allergies, deficiencies and weaknesses by analysing the resulting wave forms. The internet will certainly play a much greater part in every sort of medicine, and CM practitioners are just as worried about the dissemination of misleading information as orthodox ones. \"We often have patients turning up with very dodgy supplements that they have found on the web,\" says Dr Rajendra Sharma of the 101 Practitioners Network. So he has raised \u00a317 million from the City to set up a website that he intends to be the definitive place to discover what integrated medicine treatment works best for what disorder. \"If you have a cold, you could discover that your first step should be echinacea or some other plant with anti-viral properties, such as pomegranate, plus vitamin C. Only much later, with bronchial complications, might you take antibiotics.\" For meningitis, meanwhile, you immediately need strong antibiotics, combined with probiotics, a supplement of the beneficial gut bacteria that are killed off by antibiotics, to protect the lining of the gut. For many practitioners, this coming-together of two strands of medicine can only be beneficial. \"We really need to get away from the commplementary-orthodox split,\" says Vickers. \"What everyone wants is a form of medicine that has trials showing that it works, that gives practitioners a code of conduct and that allows patients choice and respect.\" Medicine is both an art and a science, but science has been firmly in the driving seat for 40 years. The arrival of CM practitioners may allow some of the more intangible aspects of the healing profession to re-emerge into the light, such as the power of the doctor's own belief. \"When I was starting out as a doctor, my professor told me about a new migraine drug,\" recalls Marshall Marinker, professor of general practice at the University of London. \"I prescribed it to a number of my patients, and it worked brilliantly. Many were completely cured. But then I began thinking about its mechanisms and how to design a trial, and it somehow stopped working so well. I never again got such good results as when I totally believed in it. I don't think you can measure that sort of thing in clinical trials, but it is absolutely vital to the way medicine "}
