Heartbeet includes adults with developmental disabilities and interweaves the social, artistic, and agricultural realms for the healing and renewing of our society and the earth. It is a community where everyone, regardless of ability, can find meaning, dignity and reverence for life. Community members live and support each other, in beautiful, extended family households, forming a mutually supportive environment that enables each individual to discover and develop his or her unique abilities and potential. Long term co-workers, adults with developmental disabilities and volunteers who come for a year of service, or more learn, play, and work together. Community members care for and grow with one another, celebrating the myriad of joys and challenges of life. Our anthroposophical foundation manifests itself in the recognition that each human being comprises a body, soul and spirit, and that each of these aspects has the capacity to grow. We recognize that we can actively support each other on our inner journeys by the ways we live, learn and work together. "}
