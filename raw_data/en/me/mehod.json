The authors have long term experience in clinical practice and have created a phenomenal resource for anyone who wants to use Ayurveda or Aromatherapy for self-health or as a practitioner. The body-type paradigm of Ayurveda is interwoven nicely with the aromatherapeutic actions of essential oils. This book is pure love...and information. If you want to learn more about Ayurveda, its techniques coupled with aromatherapy, this is the best book EVER. It also gives you tests to determine which of the three doshas you were born as, and which one you are now..and how to get back to the dosha you should be. It lists diets to follow as either a pita, vata, or kapha and how aromatherapy can enrich your life. This book has a lot more about aromatherapy than ayurveda. It also mentions a lot of esoteric spiritual practices . At times I felt a little bit like the author was a bit like a sales person, but I might be wrong . Anyway all said , its a decent book to read to get a basic idea about ayurveda and aromatherapy. "}
