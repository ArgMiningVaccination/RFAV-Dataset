Its authors present many new approaches within the emerging field of energy medicine that challenge us to reexamine some of the underlying causes of the increasing unaffordability of our health care system. The causes include a widespread presence of pollutants and environmental toxins, ignorance of the possible impact of genetically modified foods, and the current limited consumption of organic foods that contain significantly fewer pesticides. Useful solutions are offered by introducing the reader to a cross section of emerging energy medicine technologies, frequency therapies, ozone therapy, as well as subtle energy approaches, including the power of intention, prayer, and sound therapy. I believe that if these approaches were to become widely used, our present Western health care system would undergo a positive transformation that would reduce health care costs. In 2013, we stand at a critical moment in the evolution of our health care system, which is, for the most part, really a disease care system. The unfortunate truth is that we spend more on health care than any other country in the world, yet we are not getting the best results for these expenditures. In 2008, the latest year for reliable statistics, the United States spent more than $2.3 trillion on medical care, three times more than in 1990. It is increasingly known that the majority of these expenditures deal primarily with disease, especially in the elderly. One percent of the population accounts for 30 percent of the nation's medical expenditures. The elderly (age 65 and over) made up around 13 percent of the U.S. population in 2002, but they consumed 36 percent of total U.S. medical expenditures. Medicare, the health insurance program for the elderly, spends nearly 30 percent of its budget on beneficiaries in their final year of life. These statistics largely reflect lifelong habits of poor nutrition, lack of exercise, and lack of preventive care, accompanied by an epidemic of obesity. Two-thirds of Americans are considered overweight or obese. In addition, a 2012 report from the U.S. Institute of Medicine found a total of $765 billion of annual waste in the health care system in 2009, about 33 percent of its annual expenditures. A preventive approach to health and healing is much talked about but not sufficiently practiced to seriously impact the system now in place. Costs keep rising every year, as do the expenditures for pharmaceuticals, over-the-counter drugs, and operative procedures. Stephen M. Davidson, Boston University professor of health policy and management, describes the challenges confronting the U.S. health care system in his book Still Broken. Although the need for an affordable health care system has been the focus of federal legislation and judicial review for the last several years, we are still far from a solution. Unfortunately, the recent Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act passed by the U.S. Congress in March 2010 delivers essentially the same conventional type of care without incorporating the potential benefits of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), including energy medicine. Recognizing the health challenges facing this nation, it is hoped that this book will contribute to a more integrative health care paradigm, one that includes an expanded understanding of energies involved in healing. Albert Szent-Gy\u00f6rgyi, M.D., Ph.D., recipient of the 1937 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, said, In every culture and in every medical tradition before ours, healing was accomplished by moving energy.\u00b9 Two widely practiced medical systems on the planet that use energies for healing are traditional Chinese medicine and the ayurvedic medical system of India. The qualitative nature of energy described in these healing traditions has names such as chi, or qi, and prana. These concepts are difficult to understand by Western scientists trained in reductionistic thinking and a materialistic orientation toward the life sciences. The concept of a life force was expunged from the life sciences in the middle of the nineteenth century, especially by the work of prominent German scientists. Specifically, it was the Berlin school of physiologists, including the physician-turned-physicist Hermann von Helmholtz (sensory physiology and conservation of energy) and Emil du Bois-Reymond (discoverer of nerve action potential and the father of experimental electrophysiology), among others, that laid the foundations for a medical biophysics that is still influencing medical thinking today. However, the mysteries of life cannot be fathomed solely on the basis of biochemistry and electromagnetism, unless these subspecialties of physics, chemistry, and biology are framed in a larger context. What is now in the process of emerging is an integrative biophysics that embraces ideas from quantum physics, emergent properties of matter, consciousness research, and an expanded view of electrodynamics. From this modern perspective, life energy involves concepts such as the living light in our cells\u2014called biophotons\u2014and principles such as nonlocality, entanglement, torsion fields, coherent electric oscillations, molecular resonances, dissipative structures, and state-specific states of consciousness. The founders of quantum physics recognized that the observer, the atomic realm, and the scientific measuring instruments formed an interconnected system where all three influence each other. From the perspective of quantum physics, the observer is an integral part of the scientific process and the act of observation influences the outcome by collapsing the wave function. As quantum physics Nobel laureate Werner Heisenberg stated, What we observe is not nature itself, but nature exposed to our method of questioning.\u00b2 How can these unusual ideas of energy and life force become integrated into our current reductionistic approach to medical care? Fortunately, the winds of change are beginning to blow, and in the United States, much progress is being made at this time. Our allopathic health care system has expanded to embrace CAM in response to a public demand for a greater integration of Eastern medical approaches and ancient healing traditions. Energy medicine is now one of the four foundational pillars of CAM and has found governmental research support within the National Institutes of Health, through the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine. This is a hopeful development in the creation of a more inclusive and cost-effective health care system using energy medicine and integrative biophysics modalities. George Bernard Shaw once said, England and America are two countries separated by the same language.*1 \u00b3 By analogy, modern medicine and CAM are two medical approaches divided by a common language of energy. In traditional biophysics, the term energy means the capacity to do work and it describes a scalar quantity (having no direction or orientation). It exists in many forms, including mechanical energy, heat or thermal energy, electrical energy, and electromagnetic radiation. It can exist in potential energy, when it is not moving, or as kinetic energy, when in motion. Since almost everything is in motion, including atoms and their constituent subatomic particles, we live in a sea of vibrations, principally kinetic energy. In contrast, CAM has expanded the idea of energy to also include more subtle aspects of energy typically called putative energy medicine. Putative means that we cannot as yet measure these energies with existing biophysical instrumentation to ascertain their true nature. Many aspects of this energy can be sensed, be inwardly perceived, be operated on by trained healers, and even demonstrate an unexplained action at a distance. The powerful effects of prayer and distant healing are part of this type of energy medicine, and they are discussed from a scientific perspective by physician Larry Dossey in chapter 3. To gain a better understanding of energy in the context of energy medicine technologies, it might help to investigate the original roots of the word. The Greek philosopher Aristotle used the word energeia, literally meaning to contain work. But energeia was contrasted with hexis, which meant to possess or to be in the state of. Energeia meant doing, hexis meant possessing. Laying the foundation for ethical philosophy, but not science, Aristotle argued that virtue must be an activity, not just a state, to ensure happiness. Nonetheless, his ideas had a formative influence on later philosophical and scientific development. It was not until 1807 that Thomas Young in England first used the word energy in the modern sense. His definition is almost the same as our current definition of kinetic energy. As the nineteenth century proceeded, Helmholtz first described the principle of conservation of energy in 1847 but used the German word \"Kraft,\" which could also mean force. During this formative time, the British self-made researcher James Joule also studied the nature of various forces and their energetic interactions. He made foundational experiments to show how chemical, mechanical, electromagnetic, and thermodynamic energy or heat can be exchanged with each other while always being conserved. The unit of measurable energy is now termed the Joule in his honor. The great Scottish physicist and mathematician James Clerk Maxwell developed the first field theory of modern physics\u2014the theory of electromagnetism\u2014which he worked on for over twenty years between 1851 and 1873. Maxwell used complex mathematics, including scalar and vector potentials, which were an integral part of his field theory. Maxwell's original twenty equations were later simplified by British scientist Oliver Heaviside, using modern vector analysis, to the more recognizable four equations that every physicist and electrical engineer is familiar with. Unfortunately, in this process Heaviside eliminated vector potentials, also known as the A-field, leaving only the magnetic field (B-field) and electric field (E-field) interactions in the modern version of his theory. With that development, modern medical scientists and biophysicists are typically unaware of these potentials and their possible impact on living systems. British researcher Professor Cyril Smith has convincingly shown that these potential A-fields affect water, while British quantum biophysicist and biologist Mae-Wan Ho demonstrated how magnetic vector potential fields have a pronounced biological effect in altering genetic material, even in the absence of magnetic fields. If science is working with limited mathematical models, then the profound impact of electromagnetic technologies on living systems may be minimized or even dismissed. In contrast, modern quantum physics actively makes use of these potentials in advanced theories of electrodynamics and quantum reality. The English quantum physicist David Bohm carried out research with magnetic vector potentials (Aharonov-Bohm effect), which led him to describe deeper layers of our reality. He called this the implicate order, and it involves a reality appropriate to the findings of quantum theory. It is a reality involving paradoxical concepts such as superposition, enfolding of space-time, and nonlocal space. This implicate reality is in marked contrast to the more familiar material reality of space and time in classical physics, which he called the explicate order. Much of what we perceive of the world is in the form of this explicate order. To understand some of the putative energy medicine phenomena, such as distant healing, therapeutic touch, biomagnetic healing, prayer, intention, and consciousness affecting the complex human biofield, it is necessary to invoke the quantum physical nature of reality affecting living systems. We are very complex electromagnetic beings, with all the molecules interacting in a type of quantum jazz, a term coined by Ho. Living systems have exquisite sensitivity to electromagnetic fields created by coherent modes of vibration in the biomolecules. Scientists are now beginning to define the nature of the hidden potentials, electromagnetic fields, and dynamic quantum processes that collectively interact to make up the human biofield. The energetic resonant structures within this biofield form none other than the energetic acupuncture meridian system first discovered in Asia several millennia ago. The largest organ in the body is now understood by many to be the connective tissue matrix. It is described in chapter 1 by the energy medicine pioneering biophysicist James L. Oschman, Ph.D. If chemical toxins, heavy metals, and other biological poisons are embedded in this living matrix, the electromagnetic communication processes mediated by living light in the cells (called biophotons) become disrupted. In essence, abnormal electromagnetic resonances begin to occur from the toxic molecules embedded in the connective tissue, fat, and other storage sites\u2014impairing the functioning of healthy cells and tissues. These toxins and chemical residues act as a kind of electrical noise in the body. If this is not corrected, biochemical changes will begin to induce physiological disruptions and, over time, may lead to disease unless the matrix is detoxified appropriately. Modern medical students are insufficiently instructed in these matters, compared with their naturopathic medicine colleagues, who have a better appreciation for the need for good hydration, a balanced diet, and periodic cleansing of the tissues and the lymphatic system. As the research of Oschman and others has shown, electrical grounding of the body allows free electrons to be absorbed from the Earth to neutralize destructive free radicals that lead to inflammation. It is one of energy medicine's approaches to this prevalent condition and may in some cases eliminate the need for anti-inflammatory drugs. Once readers of this book have begun to appreciate the underlying quantum physical and electromagnetic nature of life, then it may not seem so far-fetched to envision that appropriate sympathetic vibrations of the right amplitude and frequency might have a powerful healing effect. The late American physician and biophysicist Ross Adey found that the body contained specific biological windows sensitive to electromagnetic fields capable of activating cells. These are powerful triggers of biochemical changes within cells if both the appropriate low-level amplitude and correct frequencies are present in the signals. Without the presence of these unique signal characteristics, the body will not respond. Adey's work, and that of many others in the bioelectromagnetic research community, helps us to understand why the pioneering work of Royal Raymond Rife (profiled in chapter 4) holds such promise for our future health care system. If specific frequencies and amplitudes are effective in destroying specific strains of pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi, then the need for antibiotics, which are currently used much too widely, might change. Other frequencies were found to be effective for a variety of bodily imbalances or disease states. A determined research effort in this area would be welcome to bring these frequency technologies into wider application. Today we recognize that our bodies are a symphony of vibrations involving electromagnetic and quantum processes. From this perspective, we might appreciate the tremendous impact that current telecommunications technologies appear to be having on our health. The modern world is literally overflowing with a plethora of fields and waves, filling the entire electromagnetic spectrum. They range from slow radio waves vibrating at thousands of cycles per second (AM radio) to microwaves oscillating at billions of cycles per second and coming from devices such as cell phones, WiFi for computers, cordless telephones, and smart meters on our homes. We are all part of an epidemiological experiment to see how this spectrum of electromagnetic radiation affects our long-term health and well-being. Regulatory agencies are only concerned about the short-term thermal or heating effects of these devices and downplay the potential hazards of long-term low level or nonthermal signals emitted by these microwave transmitters. This directly contradicts the findings of hundreds of studies over the last two decades that show the biologically adverse effects of these devices at currently permitted power levels. Although the convenience of our modern telecommunication devices makes them very attractive to use, unfortunately their powerful impact on our health is only now beginning to be recognized. In today's world, it is difficult to do effective double-blind, placebo-controlled scientific studies when environmental background levels of nonionizing microwave radiation are continuously rising. Perhaps the use of various Pulsors discovered by naturopathic physician George T. F. Yao, as described in chapter 5, may become one of several approaches to harmonizing the human biofield to the increasing levels of electromagnetic background radiation, often referred to as electrosmog. The importance of sound to produce healing reactions in the body is another field of research that is generally unknown in modern medicine. Early in the twentieth century, Dr. Hans Jenny in Switzerland carried out pioneering research investigating the effect of sound and vibration on all types of materials, including water. Since our body consists mostly of structured water, sound can interact with this fluid matrix. The resonances and vibrational patterns Jenny found allowed a new field of research called cymatics to emerge. The late British physician Peter Guy Manners carried out clinical research over many decades having to do with the healing effects of complex sound combinations. He achieved remarkable healings with a broad range of medical conditions, and his work has been expanded by other sound healers now actively practicing this modality. In 2008 musicologist and healer Gary Buchanan published an especially useful book called SONA: Healing with Wave Front Bioresonance, which describes the power of applied cymatic methods. The symphony of life is based on a musical and sonic blueprint. In chapter 2 of this book, the neuropsychologist John Consemulder offers deeper insight into the processes by which sound, light, and energy weave this web in the cosmos as well as in our bodies. Scientists are now also discovering how the environment directly impacts our genes to restore health or create disease. Modern molecular genetics has made great progress in deciphering the genome over the last two decades. Today, your DNA blueprint can be sequenced for less than a thousand dollars. However this approach only decodes the roughly 21,000 known genes that are actively involved in protein synthesis in the body. These exon genes make up only 1.5 percent of our DNA. In the past, much of the remaining 98.5 percent of the genome was called junk DNA because scientists did not know its purpose. Recently, scientists decoded the genome of the lowly tomato and found it contained 31,760 genes, while the highest known number of genes is around 60,000 for the protozoan causing trichomoniasis. Clearly it is not the number of human genes that is most important, but how they are activated or suppressed through internal and external environmental influences. The functional meaning of our genome's junk was recently elucidated by a project begun in 2003 called the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE). Scientists looked at the intricate network of highly complex genetic switches that are the key to turning your genes on and off. So far, they have found 4 million switching sites, covering 8.5 percent of the genome\u2014far more than anyone suspected. It is now believed that around 20 percent of the entire genome will be found to consist of these switching regulatory codons. The way in which these switches work is also turning out to be vastly more complicated than previously thought. Individual switches can interact with many genes, and defects in this switching DNA can lead to faulty gene activity and expression. These switches are playing a leading role in the emerging science of epigenomics. Here the environment plays a formidable role in steering our genetic inheritance and activating protein synthesis through gene expression. Eighty percent of the entire human genome is either transcribed, binds to regulatory proteins, or is associated with some other biochemical activity. A large part of the genome transcribes RNA, not for making proteins, but rather for regulating gene activity as well as shuffling proteins, like taxi drivers, to different parts of the genome. The epigenome is just as critical to the development of humans as is the genome. For example, by changing the diet of genetically fat and yellow agouti mice to one rich in methyl donors, found in onions, garlic, and beets, researchers have found that they could change the offspring to slim and brown mice. By epigenetic intervention, they had modulated the critical agouti gene, dramatically changing the mice's offspring. Nutrition was responsible for dimming the gene's deleterious effects, from fat and yellow mice to mice that are normal, slim, and brown. Researchers are finding that tweaking the epigenome by exposure to specific nutrients, chemicals or pesticides, or even some extra nurturing by the mother can alter the genes of the offspring, which can affect their brain for life. It is also known that inherited errors in our switching DNA and brief exposure to environmental toxins during pregnancy\u2014including electromagnetic fields\u2014can lead to the later development of illness. In the future, health-promoting epigenetic activation of our genome via this switching DNA will form the basis of a truly preventive medicine and usher in a revolution in medicine. Scientists are now gaining their first insights into the likely mechanism by which many energy medicine technologies described in this book may have their epigenetic and physiological effects. With these developments, the conventional concept of gene as fate is now outdated by epigenetics. We appear to have a measure of control over our genetics. Russian scientists, including the group working with Peter Gariaev (who has been called the father of fractal genetics), have also explored the unusual linguistic structure and electromagnetic properties of DNA. It appears that DNA's helical structure allows light (as biophotons) to spiral in a coherent manner, acting as an electromagnetic communications system inside every cell of our body. The Russians describe complex torsion fields inside living systems that interact with our very DNA. By modulating the secondary radiation from laser beams with epigenetic information they are able to positively influence the genomes of animals and help human gene expression. Using this approach, called wave genetics, they have regrown endocrine glands previously destroyed by chemical exposure, slowed the aging process in humans, and even regenerated missing teeth. It appears that an energy medicine approach to healing the genome could powerfully impact our future health care system if we are open to working in a new way. Increasingly, a select group of scientists have recognized that the electromagnetic fields inside our body make up the high-speed communication system that coordinates our living matrix, including the energetic acupuncture system. It is a higher-level control system that then modulates the biochemical pathways in every cell and tissue of the body. In essence, there is a symphony of silent music always striving to greater harmony flowing through our body each moment\u2014influencing all our organs, tissues, and cells. The good news is that modern medical science in the West is beginning to build a bridge to the ancient healing systems of the East, enriching both in the process. It is my sincere hope that this book is only the first of many that will introduce readers to the wide range of energy medicine technologies and approaches that are now emerging. The importance of innovative light and laser therapies, healing with color, a wide range of pulsed electromagnetic fields, and the power of structured water and homeopathy have been extensively documented. All these modalities will undoubtedly play a formative role in the health care system of tomorrow. I would like to close with an appeal to the reader never to forget the central importance of the spiritual dimension of our being. Modern biomedical technologies, including those of energy medicine, are but one aspect of our healing journey. If we consider that the structural, biochemical, energetic, and informational realms form an ever more subtle anatomy of our being, then our spiritual nature sits at the apex and is the source of our cyclic reappearance, life after life. Collectively, humanity now comprises a truly interconnected field of consciousness and intention. May the coming years see the emergence of a new medical and health care system that honors both our physical and subtle energetic natures in the most enlightened manner. I sincerely hope that this book contributes to that future in a useful and meaningful way. INTRODUCTION EMERGING PARADIGMS IN HEALTH AND HEALING Finley Eversole, Ph.D. There is nothing but electricity in manifestation. . . . Everything in Nature is electrical in nature; life itself is electricity. . . . Electrical discovery is only in the initial stage and all that we have is simply a prelude to the real discovery. . . . Does it mean anything to you when I say . . . the human being is electrical in origin and nature? DJWHAL KHUL Illnesses do not come upon us out of the blue. They are developed from small daily sins against Nature. When enough sins have accumulated, illnesses will suddenly appear. HIPPOCRATES In this volume we take up energy medicine\u2014an emerging paradigm that views the human body and environment primarily in electromagnetic terms and views healing as a way of achieving electrical balance. It has been said that by the end of the present century, most of the medical profession will have come to understand the human body\u2014and indeed the whole human being (body, emotions, mind, and spirit, including the living environment)\u2014primarily as fields of electromagnetic energies.
