San Pedro (Echinopsis pachanoi) - also known as Huachuma (Quechua language) - is one of the most important Master Plants in South America. It is a cactus (Echinopsis pachanoi) that has been used by shamans and other spiritual leaders in ceremonies as a tool for divination for some 3,500 years. San Pedro is a medicine with a powerful, expansive energy that enables personal and spiritual transformation and supports the path to healing. Thanks to the endogenous substance mescaline, the use of San Pedro leads to visions needed to make certain predictions and to discover spiritual and unconscious causes of illness. Until a few years ago, the secrets and uses of this cactus were reserved for indigenous peoples and you had to travel to South America to participate in a ceremony. But now you can also experience the miraculous effects of San Pedro during our [ Spanish retreats in a safe environment and with experienced guides](https://om-mij.nl/en/locations/retreat-spain/). How does San Pedro work? About one to two hours after drinking San Pedro tea, you will discover its secret and feel the psychoactive ingredient mescaline. The effect can last for eight to 15 hours. The effects include a strong sensitivity to light; you see and feel every ray of light and you even see people and things glowing in a 'divine light'. All your senses are more open. You perceive your surroundings more intensely. During the ceremony, we encourage you to go along with the energy of letting go of your physical identity so that you start experiencing yourself as soul and spirit. This transcendental journey lets you walk through the physical and spiritual worlds. In addition, all kinds of other emotions can occur: Laughter (San Pedro teaches you joy), Crying (you cleanse your emotions and heal), Fear (you face your fears and retrieve the power you gave away to something or someone in the past), Love (the essence of oneness, wholeness and healing). The effect of San Pedro is in several ways more pleasant than that of Peyote (a cactus that also contains mescaline) or ayahuasca. The taste is not as bitter and nausea does not occur. In addition, the psychedelic experience is calmer, less overwhelming and not as physical as that of Peyote or [ayahuasca](https://om-mij.nl/en/healing-ceremonies/ayahuasca/). Differences between San Pedro and ayahuasca San Pedro has different effects from ayahuasca. Ayahuasca is experienced as the strong feminine energy of a mother. San Pedro has the masculine energy of a gentle grandfather. Ayahuasca helps you gain insight into yourself, find and heal lost soul parts, and revive your inner child. It is an inner journey into the universe within yourself. San Pedro, on the contrary, is more outward-looking. It shows you your multidimensional nature and lets you see how the other dimensions blend with physical reality. It helps you integrate your experiences and form a stronger connection with the world around you. San Pedro does not affect your motor skills as [ayahuasca ](https://om-mij.nl/en/healing-ceremonies/ayahuasca/)does. So you can move around well during a San Pedro trip and meet your own physical needs.
