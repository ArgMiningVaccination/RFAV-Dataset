The Safe and Sound Protocol is an evidence-based therapeutic tool designed to reset the nervous system and return it to safety. Designed to work with other therapeutic approaches and modalities, the SSP features specially filtered music that stimulates the vagus nerve. Suitable for children and adults, the SSP has demonstrated benefits for individuals with trauma, anxiety, sensory processing differences, and much more.

Speak with a Program Consultant. \"If you want to improve the world, start by making people feel safe.\" \u2014 Dr. Stephen Porges What is the Safe and Sound Protocol? Developed by Dr. Stephen Porges, founder of the [Polyvagal Theory](https://integratedlistening.com/science-of-feeling-safe/), the Safe and Sound Protocol is a non-invasive acoustic vagus nerve stimulator that helps your clients connect with themselves, others, and the world from a foundation of physiological safety. Your client experiences the SSP playlists through over-the-ear headphones which can be delivered in-clinic or remotely. Engage the ventral vagal complex through the neural network associated with listening. Shift the nervous system into safety using the SSP's algorithmically filtered music. Administer therapy to a physiologically and psychologically available client. How Does It Work? The Safe & Sound Protocol (SSP) is the only practical application of Polyvagal Theory, and is designed to improve sound sensitivities and auditory processing, behavioral state regulation, and social engagement behaviors through specially-filtered music. The SSP allows for the repatterning of neural networks and improved regulation of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) for lasting change. Based on hierarchical recruitment of the ANS, the SSP trains the middle ear muscles to tune-in to cues of safety signaled by the frequencies of human voice, which stimulates the social engagement system through the neural network associated with listening. The SSP interrupts chronic states of nervous system defense by stimulating the neural networks associated with listening. The SSP uses algorithmically filtered music focused on the frequency range of the human voice that alters the way sounds are interpreted. This ushers the nervous system out of a defensive (fight, flight or freeze) state and into a socially engaged (ventral vagal) state. Who Is It For? The SSP is suitable for children and adults, and has been designed to work with a diverse variety of therapeutic approaches and modalities. Its effectiveness has been proven in a wide range of studies including clinical trials involving children with autism, along with numerous case studies demonstrating effectiveness with emotional regulation, trauma, anxiety and more. Research has even begun on how the SSP can affect the impact of long COVID.

Case Studies & Research Case Study: Finding Nervous System Regulation After Long COVID Teresa is 52 years old and a healthy, active woman. In March 2020, she tested positive for COVID-19 and since then has experienced symptoms associated with long COVID, including severe fatigue, joint pain, brain fog and impaired proprioception. Looking for support, Teresa turned to provider Christa Hines, who delivered the SSP with the intention of regulating her client's nervous system, which seemed to be stuck in survival mode with post-viral dysautonomia symptoms. Case Study: Discovering The Bonds Of Connection AB is 12 years old and presents with autism, anxiety, sensory overwhelm, depression and irritability. A reactive child, AB often appears disconnected and hopeless, and never expresses missing her parents or seeks affection. After seeing no progress with previous therapists, AB's parents found SSP provider Joseph Falkner, who delivered the SSP to his client, aiming to increase her felt sense of safety, flexibility of her nervous system, and overall connectedness. Reducing Hypersensitivities In Autistic Spectrum Disorder: Preliminary Findings Evaluating The Listening Project Protocol (A Precursor To The Safe And Sound Protocol) Stephen W. Porges, Olga V. Bazhenova, Elgiz Bal, Nancy Carlson, Yevgeniya Sorokin, Keri J. Heilman, Edwin H. Cook, and Gregory F. Lewis The Effect of the SSP on the Regulation of Hypersensitivity in ASD Sonja Heinrich Michel Tuning Into Change Keri Heilman, Ph.D., University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill Testimonials Our client and her family have attempted many different therapeutic interventions over the developmental years and unfortunately were discouraged with the outcomes. The positive results of the SSP have provided this family with encouragement and hope. Dalyce Wilson-Podesky and Julie Campbell, Therapists Safe, sound, and simple. The level of ease and simplicity that comes with SSP digital delivery contributes to keeping the experience within reach of the nervous system's capacity to safely engage. Deb Dana We have tried so many other things with minimal help - we just never got to the core of the issue - the SSP got to the core. Amy R., Parent Thankful to be able to offer such a powerful treatment for our kiddos and their families! Julie Kurrasch, Therapist Empower Your Clients to Better Connect with Themselves, Others and the World Around Them [The \"safe\" you provide is just as important as the \"sound\" in your clients' path to positive outcomes.] The SSP is delivered through an app-based platform, available on Android and iOS, that empowers therapist, clinicians, educators and healthcare providers to easily and conveniently provide this life-changing therapy. Delivered either in-clinic or remotely, the client experiences the SSP through over-the-ear headphones conveniently connected to the Unyte-iLs app. The clinician manages client access and monitors listening on the MyUnyte Platform. Many clinicians have noted results after one session, and after completion of the full program (which can be titrated based on individual client need and receptivity), the ability for their clients to better regulate and connect as a result of physiologically retuning their nervous system toward safety.
