It's little wonder, then, that your Instagram feed is full of your friends swapping sangria for the meditative trance of a soundbath, or that confessing to seeing a shaman for some spiritual healing is a lot less 'out there' than it used to be. Whilst religion perhaps historically acted as the rock on which to steady ourselves when times were fraught, there's now a faith-based void for an increasingly irreligious society ( [70% of young people](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/21/christianity-non-christian-europe-young-people-survey-religion) in the UK don't identify with a religious practice, currently.) The data bears this hypothesis out. The psychic services industry [saw 2.4% growth](https://www.ibisworld.com/industry-trends/specialized-market-research-reports/consumer-goods-services/personal/psychic-services.html) between 2011 and 2016, Kim Kardashian is open about visiting tarot card readers and Miranda Kerr [sells healing crystals](https://www.instagram.com/p/BmMUA6dgyHv/) via her beauty brand, Kora Organics. Which brings us neatly to the topic of this feature. 'The healing powers of crystals have been recognised for centuries,' says Laurey Simmons, author of The Inner Beauty Bible. 'Their properties may not be scientifically proven, but if they can enhance someone's healing journey, that's a good thing.' What's more, they can be more beneficial than ever in the modern world, as Tamara Driessen explains on her [Wolf Sister](http://www.wolfsister.com/book) site, about the philosophy behind her book [The Crystal Code](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0241346975) - which explains how to harness the power of more than 70 stones. 'Our lives are pretty stressful, from the mountains of work emails to the never-ending life admin, finding time to see friends and family whilst still getting in those gym workouts, and why does everyone on Instagram have all this figured out,' writes the crystal healer, tarot reader and reiki master. 'Working with crystals is a way to slow that frenetic world down, realign your intentions and find the inner calm we all seek.' As Simmons says - there isn't hard evidence as such to support the idea that crystals are beneficial. But they won't do you any harm (other than financial, if you go [full Spencer Pratt](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/05/how-spencer-pratt-and-heidi-montag-blew-10-million.html) and spend a swish $10m on the things) and look pretty, if nothing else. Disclaimer done: here's what each healing crystal is said to do for you, from those in the know. Healing crystals: what each one is supposed to help you with Amethyst healing crystal What? It's a meditative and calming stone that promotes balance and peace, along with emotional stability and inner strength. 'Amethyst is good for treating insomnia and grief, as it neutralises negative energy,' says intuitive healer Emmy-Lou Knowles. 'It also softens the nervous system.' How? 'Just holding the stone is enough to act as a soothing emotional pick-me-up,' says Knowles.If sweet dreams are more your focus, place a piece of Amethyst on your bedside table or under your pillow. 'It'll bring peaceful energy to your sleep and protect against nightmares,' says Simmons. Black tourmaline healing crystal What? Worried about what your technology addiction might be doing to your health? According to Simmons, black Tourmaline can guard you from 'electric smog' (aka the electromagnetic field radiation emitted by your mobile and laptop) and ward off negative energies from your home. 'Crystals transmit signals all the time,' says Knowles. 'These effectively create a barrier between you and man-made technological energy.' How?Put a stone on your desk or next to your phone or computer to maximise its benefits. Moonstone healing crystal What? 'Moonstone is a mothering, nurturing stone,' says Jessica Seaman, founder of luxury candle brand Lara Quin. 'It's good for new beginnings, relaxation and help you tune into your psychic abilities. How? Seaman and Knowles both recommend that you wear the gemstone so you have its energy directly against your skin. Rose quartz healing crystal What? 'Rose Quartz is the strongest stone for creating harmony in relationships with family, friends and lovers,' says Seaman. 'It's also really good for your skin,' adds Knowles. 'Practitioners of Chinese medicine believe that spots are caused by fears and worries.Rose Quartz helps to tone down such emotions so they can surface much more gently.' How? 'Balance it on chakra points (the centre of your chest above the heart, on your throat and on the crown of your head), or put it under your pillow so it radiates through while you're sleeping,' suggests Knowles.Alternatively, wear it in a necklace. Argonite healing crystal How? Feeling a little off kilter? The spiked star clusters of Aragonite will balance you right out. 'Because of their form, the rocks can radiate energy in all directions,' says Simmons. She also recommends aragonite for its calming properties. 'It can help support compassionate communication, self-expression and meditation.' How? For energy in the home, give aragonite pride of place in your living room, or if you have a meeting or presentation you're nervous about, keep a piece of the stone in your pocket. "}
