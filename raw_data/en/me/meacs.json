Values Statement Our governing values are the principles guiding our ethical behavior every day at Shands Healthcare. The following values help University of Florida Health achieve its mission: - Accountability - Collaboration - Compassion - Communication - Competence - Creativity - Empowerment - Excellence - Integrity - Trust - Respect Vision To be the premier provider of patient and family centered behavioral health care in our region. The philosophy of SPH is based on the belief that the patient and the patient's family or support system is at the center of the interdisciplinary team effort. Each team member is believed to be vital to the functioning of the team, through the assessment, treatment plan development, provision of care and evaluation of treatment outcomes. (In the outpatient area, care delivery is often discipline specific and may not involve a treatment team approach). Trauma Informed Care UF Health Psychiatric Hospital and UF Health Psychiatry are committed to creating a Trauma-Informed behavioral health environment. This commitment means (1) developing a trauma-informed workforce, including recruiting, hiring and retaining trauma-informed staff; (2) providing continuous training on evidenced based and emerging trauma-informed best practices; (3) developing competencies specific to trauma-informed care and providing trauma-informed supervision to all members of the workforce; (4) implementing trauma-informed polices; and (5) adapting the physical environment to promote safe and trauma-informed spaces. UF Health Psychiatric Hospital and UF Health Psychiatry are dedicated to preventing and addressing secondary trauma in our behavioral health care providers. Creation of a trauma-informed behavioral health environment is based on key principles of safety, trustworthiness and transparency, collaboration, empowerment, peer support, and will consider cultural, historical and gender issues. The implementation of the Trauma-Informed Care is overseen by a steering committee which is made up of leadership, medical staff, and other hospital department staff including nurses, mental health technician, support technician, peer specialist, therapist, intake counselor, environment of care personnel, and security. Definition of Patient Care, Patient Services, and Patient Support Patient services at SPH occur through an organized and systematic process designed to ensure the delivery of safe, effective, timely, and Trauma Informed Care and treatment. These patient services are limited to those departments that have direct contact with patients. The full scope of patient care is provided only by those professionals who are charged with the additional functions of patient assessment and planning patient care based on findings from assessments. Patient services and patient care are provided primarily by licensed staff. Patient support is provided by a variety of individuals and departments that may not have direct contact with patients, but that support the care provided by hands-on care providers. Professional nursing care is delivered by Registered Nurses, Licensed Practical Nurses and Mental Health Technicians (MHT) also provide patient care under the direction of the Registered Nurse and in accordance with the Plan for the Provision of Nursing Care. Monitoring for patient safety is a basic component of the milieu approach.

Staff are trained to meet the needs of the clients served. Extent to which Level of Care or Service Provided Meets Patient's Needs - The assessment process looks at the whole person: bio-psycho-social (body, mind, spirit). The primary focus of care is the psychiatric and/or substance use disorder(s). Patients are admitted to the appropriate level of care given this assessment. - The age range of patients served at SPH includes children through geriatrics.

In the outpatient area, the symptoms frequently seen include disturbances of mood, anxiety disorders, situational disturbance. - For inpatients, concurrent active medical problems are addressed by attending medical staff directly and via consults. Individuals requiring more intense medical/surgical care than can be arranged at SPH are transferred to a medical/surgical hospital, generally UF Health Shands Hospital (SUF) on a medical unit or Unit 52 psychiatric services. The patient/family preferences are part of this decision-making process. In the event of a medical emergency, the County Emergency Medical Service is contacted and the patient is transported to an emergency room. - Types of services most frequently provided at SPH include: assessment/evaluation, medication management, nursing care, milieu approaches, education and therapy groups, family approaches including therapy, activity or recreational therapy, occupational therapy, and discharge planning - Length of stay in the inpatient and partial hospital programs varies, with a range from hours to several months.

Standards/Regulations impacting services. - The Baker Act regulates admissions and treatment for all psychiatric patients. The Marchman Act regulates involuntary admission for substance treatment. As required by Florida Statute, the rights of patients are closely monitored. As deemed clinically necessary, the process for involuntary placement and treatment is followed, including identification of a guardian advocate for the individual, if appropriate. Patients then have a civil court hearing onsite. The patient(s) is escorted by staff, and an attending physician and case manager also attend. In the event of a medical emergency at SPH, staff on site stabilize the patient as appropriate per Basic Life Support (BLS) training and 911 is called. This facility does not have the capacity in terms of trained staff or equipment to meet the clinical needs of a person experiencing a medical emergency. Medical staff coverage is provided by the University of Florida Department of Psychiatry physicians. When a physician is not onsite, an on-call protocol is followed. Staffing Plans Staffing plans for patient care/service departments are developed based on the level and scope of care provided, the frequency of the care provided, and a determination of the level of staff necessary to provide required care. Patient Care / Organizational Quality Assessment and Improvement All departments are responsible for following the hospital's Performance Measures, Quality and Patient Safety Plan including planned quality assessment and improvement activities, initiating activities designed to follow-up on unusual occurrences or specific concerns/issues which may include formal quality improvement initiatives, following policies and procedures for ensuring staff competence, and follow-up as appropriate on patient/family complaints and patient questionnaire results. Input and feedback from patients, staff and physicians guide the improvement processes. Each department, as appropriate, may be represented on CQI teams for the organization. Integration of Patient Care and Support Services A collaborative interdisciplinary approach, which takes into account the unique knowledge, judgment, and skills of a variety of disciplines in achieving desired patient outcomes, serves as a foundation for integration. Open lines of communication exist between departments providing patient care, patient services and support services within the hospital, and, as appropriate, with community agencies, to ensure efficient, effective and continuous patient care.
