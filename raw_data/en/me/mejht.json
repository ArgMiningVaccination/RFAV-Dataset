As our friends at [Fiery Sage Healing](http://www.fierysagewellness.com/#!acupuncture/cesu) explain, World Health Organization and National Institute of Health recognize acupuncture a solution for many treatable medical conditions including chronic pain, chronic fatigue, addictions, emotional issues, anxiety, allergies, insomnia, headaches, digestive disorders etc. Acu Detox (Acupuncture Detoxification) has now gained popularity in effectively helping with the withdrawal symptoms from detoxification of addictive substances such as alcohol, caffeine, illegal drugs, prescription drugs, nicotine, and addictive behaviors such as gambling. Acu Detox is an acupuncture of the ear that works with Post-Acute Withdrawal Symptoms (PAWS). This is different from the medical detox that is performed under a supervised medical facility. This procedure can be done either lieing down or seated in a chair by a trained Acupuncture Detoxification Specialist. At Sage Recovery & Wellness Center, we also offer [Acu Detox as a la carte service](http://sagerecoveryaustin.com/our-services/) as well as part of [our intensive outpatient program](http://sagerecoveryaustin.com/adult-intensive-outpatient-program-iop/). Our trained Acupuncture Detoxification Specialist applies fine gauge, sterilized, one-time use stainless steel needles just under the skin in five designated points in each ear. For those uncomfortable with needles, seeds are also available as an option for the treatment. A typical session includes placement of the needles to which they remain in the ear for 30-45 minutes. Clients will receive treatment while seated in a group. Some of the benefits reported by clients and clinicians are \"a more optimistic and cooperative attitude towards the process of recovery, reduction in cravings, anxiety, and sleep disturbance, and less need for pharmaceuticals. Call us at Sage Recovery & Wellness Center 512-306-1394 or info@SageRecoveryAustin.com to get more information about this popular outpatient service. "}
