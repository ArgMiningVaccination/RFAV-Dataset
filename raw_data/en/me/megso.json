Dioscorides, the Greek physician, writing in the 1st century AD referred to the healing properties of yarrow for battle wounds.\" The name yarrow is apparently derived from hieros, which means sacred, because of the plant's association with ceremonial magic. Yarrow was thought to be richly endowed with spiritual properties, so it was preserved in temples and treated with special reverence. Its healing effect upon the blood was seen as an ability to influence the 'life\u2014blood', the essence or ego that is carried in the blood. It was used as an amulet, a charm to protect against negative energy and evil, capable of overcoming the forces of darkness and being a conductor of benevolent powers. It was also believed to be a love charm and to be ruled by the planet Venus. In folklore, a maiden who places yarrow under her pillow and repeats the rhyme below will dream of her future husband.\" Yarrow's botanical name Achillea refers to the ancient Greek hero Achilles who during the Trojan War, legend says, used yarrow to treat his and his soldier's wounds. Throughout, history until the First World War, yarrow has been used for treating wounds, hence its common names soldiers' woundwort and staunchweed.' In China, yarrow stalks were used to reawaken the spiritual forces of the superconscious mind during ritual divination using the I Ching.
