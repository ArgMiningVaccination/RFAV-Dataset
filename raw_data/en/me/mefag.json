It is a complex involves many types of cells, proteins, tissues, the liver, spleen, thymus, the lymphatic system and bone marrow. Through a series of steps called the immune response, the immune system attacks against infections whether they be bacterial, viral, fungal or some other type of infection. It is essential that a strong and balanced immune system is required for health maintenance and to fight off any infectious organisms it comes into contact with (Newman, 2018) Poor nutritional habits, insufficient sleep, lack of exercise, stress, cigarettes, alcohol, etc., decrease the immune system functions. The weak immune system causes frequent and recurrent infections. Abnormalities of the immune system can lead to allergic diseases and autoimmune disorders. Weak or altered immune system may also cause chronic allergies, dry and itchy skin, eczema, low energy, feeling tired all the time, food cravings, digestive problems like diarrhoea, gas, bloating, cramping, constipation, aches & pains (WebMD) Natural Immune boosting For optimal functioning of our immune system, we should maintain a healthy lifestyle. If you drink alcohol, drink only in moderation. Don't smoke. Get adequate sleep. Take steps to avoid infection, such as washing your hands frequently and cooking meats thoroughly. Try to minimize stress. (Harvard University, 2018) Eat a diet high in fruits and vegetables, nuts, and seeds, which will provide your body with the nutrients your immune system needs. Exercise regularly. Moderate regular exercise promotes good circulation, which allows the cells and substances of the immune system to move through the body freely and do their job efficiently. There are many natural immune boosting foods and herbs. Vitamin C rich fruits like grapefruit, oranges, lemons are very good natural immune boosters. Ginger may help decrease inflammation. Turmeric got anti-inflammatory properties. Green tea contains many antioxidants to help with immune boosting. Garlic is another immune booster. Because heat deactivates a key active ingredient, add it to foods just before serving. For a healthy immune system our gut health, liver health and emotional health are also important. Homeopathic remedies help to naturally boost our immune system and keep it functioning at optimal levels. Homeopathic remedies stimulate the body's natural defenses and promote the body's healing response. Homeopathy uses many remedies from plant Kingdom which have been used traditionally for immune boosting. Echinacea, Gelsemium, Sambucus, Aloe Vera are some of the homeopathic immune boosters from the plant kingdom. In addition, there are many remedies from animal kingdom, minerals & metals in homeopathy. Arsenicum alb, Mercurius solubilise, Ferrum. Phos are some of them. A professional homeopathic review is needed for remedy selection because homeopathic remedy selection is a complex process involving individualisation of a person including both physical & emotional peculiarities.
