It throws us challenges we don't know how to get through. You forget to breath, to take time to reflect, to slow down. So, you barrel forward at an unsustainable pace, pushing the feelings down or off-loading them onto others. Not only are our therapists trained to help you through this, but we've been there too. As humans we all experience grief, anxiety, depression, relationship struggles, self-confidence issues and more. Yep, sometimes there's more! Let us be your guide on a journey of self-discovery to help you slow down, grow emotional intelligence and capacity, create healthier boundaries and trust, discover a deeper understanding of self, and uncover your authenticity and thrive. \"We are always in a perpetual state of being created and creating ourselves.\" - Daniel J. Siegel Teens Moodiness, self-isolation, difficulty with friendships, struggles in school, poor choices, and lack of motivation can be a few of the bumps in the teenage years. We know that you want the best for your teen and wish for them to be happy and healthy. We also know that this isn't always the case. Your teen will encounter various obstacles throughout their life. Sometimes, they might not have the skills necessary to navigate these obstacles effectively. Let us be your teen's guide on their journey to - Overcome obstacles. - Discover who they are. - Understand they are enough just as they are (giving up perfectionism). - Grow emotional and social intelligence. - Define and maintain healthy boundaries. - Develop trusting relationships. - Finding self-agency and the power of their voice. Couples You and your partner used to be on the same team, but these days it feels like you're worlds a part. Maybe you fight more, keep score, have less intimacy, and struggle to find time to give to the relationship. You've grown so far a part, and you aren't sure how to find the way back. We understand that relationships aren't always easy and the energy and attraction of new love can fade. We also know (from the research of John Gottman) that you can rekindle love and find deeper connection. We guide couples to a greater understanding of each other and in turn increased closeness. Whether it be communication issues, conflict management and resolution, money issues, or adjusting to life transitions we are here to help. We'll help you and your partner identify what is going well and what needs work. We will provide a safe space and skills to help you navigate conflicts and change the way you approach asking for what you need. Building trust and emotional intelligence will be a stop on our journey. Finally, we'll make sure to help you celebrate and be thankful for the other person and for your part in making the relationship work. \"Successful long-term relationships are created through small words, small gestures, and small acts.\" - John M. Gottman Workshops Finding that the knowledge you are gaining in individual therapy aren't translating to every day life? Attending to your mental health is a multifaceted journey. Workshops can accelerate the self-discovery journey and provide breakthroughs to move you closer to the apex of authentic living. There is no greater force than to be be seen, heard and understood by a group of your peers. However, this takes great vulnerability. Luckily, there is no better setting to learn vulnerability, courage, and compassion than our emotionally secure and confidential workshops. We are trained in the workshops of Bren\u00e9 Brown and in Mindful Self Compassion, and take pride sharing these life-changing teachings with you. Each workshop guides you and your fellow participants through research based education on topics such as shame, vulnerability, shame resiliency, trust, and values. We teach skills and we practice them in group. We share, we bond, we laugh, and we cry. And we do it all together.
