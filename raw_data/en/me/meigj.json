[[1]](#cite_note-1) The assessments for improvement (clinical outcomes) are made using biomedical parameters. Integrative medicine mainly focuses on prevention, improvement in the quality of life and healing, and holistic treatment. The present article provides insights into integrative medicine practices in skin diseases with evidence from peer-reviewed publications from an integrative medicine treatment clinic; Institute of Applied Dermatology. Diagnosis through Integrative Medicine In integrative medicine, a disease is diagnosed in contemporary medical science and its comparable condition in [ayurveda](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Ayurveda) following the patient examination together. The patient examination is done by the multisystem doctors' team separately based on their health system's guidelines. This approach allows a clinician to understand the patient's condition and helps identify the requirements, which is essential in the treatment using drugs from more than one system of medicine simultaneously. The findings of all the systems are documented to compare clinical features, prognosis, method of drug selection, and possible action of the drug in a specific disease condition. This process follows each therapeutic system's guidelines strictly. After examining multiple patients, a sthaneeya vikruti table was developed by collating all patients' information. The information that contradicts the certain well-known facts of allopathy was excluded through mutual discussion. For example, the coppery red colour (thamra varna) of pitta dominant shwitra was excluded since it is a classical feature of lepromatous leprosy. The international experts reviewed the integrative medicine protocol and upgraded it whenever the multisystem doctor's team needed improvement. [[2]](#cite_note-2) For example, in Psoriasis, annular, erythematous, xerosis lesions with an uneven surface are diagnosed as guttae psoriasis. The sthaneeya vikruti table lists the comparable clinical terms as explained in Ayurvedic classics in the context of [Kushtha](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Kushtha) are listed in table 1. It shows that guttae psoriasis resembles mandala kushtha. |Biomedical description||comparable terms in | Clinical examination in integrative medicine gives a mutual orientation with different medical systems. Dermatological features and their Ayurvedic correlations in Lichen Planus [[4]](#cite_note-4) are given in table 2. |Biomedical description||Comparable terms in | Specific nomenclature resembling lichen planus is not observed in [Ayurveda](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Ayurveda) classics. However, in such cases, [Ayurveda](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Ayurveda) describes them based on pathophysiological features and still recommends treatments. In table 3, symptoms of lymphedema and its relative biomedical terms in ayurveda and biomedicine are listed. For example, lymphedema is known as Shleepada in [Ayurveda](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Ayurveda). [[5]](#cite_note-5). description||Comparable terms in | The above examples show that the final diagnosis could be similar even though the nomenclatures are different in two different medical systems. In an integrated system, both systems learn from each other. Local pathology (sthaneeya vikruti) While examining a patient in [Ayurveda](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Ayurveda), the vitiated [dosha](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dosha) must be carefully elicited through clinical examination. [Ayurveda](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Ayurveda) selects an appropriate drug for a chosen patient, whereas modern medicine selects a patient for a chosen drug. The examination of the status of [dosha](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dosha) in skin diseases can be done based on clinical features, as shown in the example (table 5). [[7]](#cite_note-7) repigmentation within the lesioned skin when examined for the first time| Clinical methods in [Ayurveda](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Ayurveda) The core concept of integrative medicine is 'adhere to the basics of each system of medicine being integrated. If another system cannot explain certain concepts of one medical system, it should not be rejected. Instead, it should be accepted and included. 'Amsha-amsha kalpana' of [Ayurveda](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Ayurveda) is comparable to the system by system examination of biomedicine. Researchers have shown that ayurvedic clinical examination goes beyond the ten types of clinical examination (dashavidha pariksha; the classical [Ayurveda](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Ayurveda) teaching). [[8]](#cite_note-8) Clinical methods in [Ayurveda](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Ayurveda) can be categorized as shown in table 7. |Clinical [Roga](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Roga)avastha details of patient information contribute to the Ayurvedic diagnosis and drug selection. [Dosha](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dosha) theories and individualized medicine are essential concepts of [Ayurveda](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Ayurveda), meaning clinical presentation and its pathophysiology are of prime importance. In biomedicine, clinical presentations, diagnosis, and co-morbidities are also given prime importance. In addition, clinical methods and differential diagnosis are in greater detail than in [Ayurveda](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Ayurveda). Skin diseases in [Ayurveda](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Ayurveda) In [Ayurveda](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Ayurveda), seven major skin diseases (maha kushtha) and 11 minor skin diseases (kshudra kushtha) are explained. Mainly this classification is based on the [dosha](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dosha) combination. The skin lesion is examined according to color, shape, appearance, sensation, spreading in the body, pain, and discharge. For example, the symptoms of Kapala kushtha and its attributes are given in Table 8. |Ayurvedic term||Biomedical description||Attributes| |Krishna||Hyperpigmented||Color| |Kapalabha||Dusky red lesions are also categorized based on history, morphology, pattern of distribution, and others. Rather than disease, those 11 minor skin diseases need to be considered as lesioned skin morphology. In the Institute of Applied Dermatology, Kasargod, Kerala, [Ayurveda](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Ayurveda) doctors are asked to determine [dosha](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dosha) vitiation of specific skin lesions. Dermatologists also examine the same patients to confirm the biomedical diagnosis. Thus, the conditions are diagnosed and treated with an integrative approach. Stages of disease [Ayurveda](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Ayurveda) describes different stages of the disease by different names. For example, fig 6 can be discussed below. Fig 6 (a) is Lichen rubour planus. are hypertrophic lichen planus. is hypopigmentation observed in the middle, surrounded by violaceous color. The lesions are thickened (ghana), elevated (utseda) with rough edges (rukshambahi). All represent [Kapha](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Kapha) [vata](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Vata) [dosha](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Dosha) dominance. It is essential to know the stage of disease (roga avastha) to guide specific and selective treatment options. In Fig 7, both limbs exhibit erythema (rakta varna), discharge (srava) and papular lesions. Therefore, it is considered as pitta predominant condition. However, the same treatment fails in one patient (7B) but improves the condition in another (7A). The 7B patient developed more pain, which is considered as aggravation of vata. Biopsy of the patient in (Fig 7B)revealed that the condition was lymphangiosarcoma arising from lymphoedema, while the patient who got relief by treatment is lymphoedema with lymphangiectasia and lymphorrhoea (Fig 7A). Treatment of skin disorders Importance of [agni](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Agni), [ama](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Ama) The assessment of [agni](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Agni) (digestion and metabolism) and [ama](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Ama) (accumulated undigested biological waste in the digestive tract) is vital for treating a skin disorder. The importance of treating [ama](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Ama) is shown in figure 8. The [ama](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Ama) aggravates by the treatment for vitiligo without [ama](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Ama) [pachana](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Pachana) (digestion of [ama](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Ama)). When [ama](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Ama) is treated, the vitiligo also decreases. So if [ama](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Ama) is present, treatment to remove it should be given at the beginning. Integrative therapies should not compromise biomedical pathology, neither the principles of [Ayurveda](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Ayurveda). Table 9 shows that mutual dialogue between the systems of medicine leads to the integrated treatment protocol |International Society of Lymphology consensus requirements |[Ayurveda](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Ayurveda)elements The rotating ankle movements as a Yoga exercise (Gulpha chakrasana) are practiced for lymphoedema patients. An increase in radioisotope clearance from lymphatics of lower limbs with even small-amplitude ankle movements is reported by Prof Peter Mortimer. [[10]](#cite_note-10) Yoga and asana bring mobility, joint and muscle pump activation and dermal stretch. It is hypothesized that Yoga may induce drainage of lymph. [[11]](#cite_note-11) The above approach to chronic disease care leads to better treatment not provided by a single system alone. For example, figure 9 below shows the response of Lymphatic Filariasis (lymphoedema) following integrative medicine treatment. A clinic to lab research-based developed from such studies might provide new treatments for chronic disease. [[12]](#cite_note-12) Conclusion Integrative medicine bridges the gap between biomedicine and [Ayurveda](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Ayurveda). It allows the re-purposing of drugs within [Ayurveda](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Ayurveda). Integrative medicine helps [Ayurveda](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Ayurveda) to stage the disease; by adopting modern investigations, effectiveness of treatment can be improved. At the same time, intersectoral collaboration helps modern medicine to use evidence-based traditional medicines. [Prakriti](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Prakriti) based studies will add more knowledge to pharmacodynamics. Especially in chronic conditions, integrating [Ayurveda](/mediawiki-1.32.1/index.php?title=Ayurveda) and Yoga could be an example for WHOs innovative care for chronic conditions. [[13]](#cite_note-13) In order to develop a treatment protocol of integrative medicine, a sound knowledge of applied and translational science is required.
