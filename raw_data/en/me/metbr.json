The whirlwind romance led to a whirlwind marriage, one that ended after mere months. Her second marriage ended over 22 years ago, for reasons that also defy convention as they had nothing to do with lack of commitment, finances or infidelity. Paloma remained true to who she is and what she loves most, which helped her navigate divorce. In this conversation, Paloma and Simone discuss: - What should be hands down the most important thing in a marriage - The power of special connections (not necessarily to other people) - The magic language we do not speak - How our talents/gifts/passions affect our marriage - The answer from couples counselling that didn't come from the counsellor - Friendship after divorce - Does our spouse complete us? - What to do when we feel overwhelmed And so much more.
