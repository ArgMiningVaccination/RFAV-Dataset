It recognizes the University's overarching commitment to educat - ing health care professionals who preserve life and protect patients, and it is the distinguishing identification of RUSH University . Its two colors, green and gold, merge the tradition of the past with the custom of the present, as old gold was the single historical color of RUSH Medical College and green is used for the modern Medical Center . The motto, \"ministrare per scientiam,\" translated from Latin means to \"minister (care for or serve) through scientific knowledge . \" It was adopted by the Board of Trustees in September 1993 to reflect the commitment to educate car - ing professionals whose practice is based in knowledge . The shadow in the background is the anchor cross, a symbol of hope and steadfastness, which became the emblem of the merged Presbyterian and St . Luke's hospitals in 1957 and the foundation that created the vision for RUSH University . Superimposed on top is the stylized version of the anchor cross that was adopted in 1971 during the merger of RUSH Medical College and Presbyterian-St . Luke's Hospital . The final elements are Chicago, the University's home city, and the date of the University's founding, 1972 . The RUSH University Board of Overseers adopted the seal in 1999 .

History of RUSH University RUSH University is the academic component of RUSH University Medical Center . Founded in 1972, the University has expanded from one college and fewer than 100 students to four colleges and more than 2,700 students . It includes RUSH Medical College, RUSH University College of Nursing, the College of Health Sciences and the Graduate College . RUSH Medical College is named for Benjamin RUSH, a physician from Pennsylvania and signer of the Declaration of Independence . RUSH Medical College was chartered in 1837 and opened officially on Dec . 4, 1843, with 22 students enrolled in a 16-week course . During the first century of operation, more than 10,000 physicians received their train - ing at RUSH Medical College . RUSH Medical College was affiliated with the University of Chicago from 1898 until 1942, when the medical college temporarily suspended its educational program, though it continued its corporate existence . Its faculty continued undergraduate and graduate teaching of medicine and the biological sciences as members of the faculty of the University of Illinois . The charter of the medical college was reactivated in 1969, when it became part of the Medical Center . RUSH Medical College reopened in 1971 with a class of 66 first-year students and 33 third-year students . First- year class size reached its projected maximum of 120 in 1976 . RUSH University College of Nursing represents a com - bined heritage dating back to the late 19th century when its first antecedent, the St . Luke's Hospital School of Nursing, opened in 1885 to offer diploma education to nurses . In 1903, the Presbyterian Hospital School of Nursing accepted its first students . From 1956 to 1968, nurses were taught at the merged Presbyterian-St . Luke's Hospital School of Nursing . Before the establishment of the College of Nursing in 1972, more than 7,000 nurses had graduated from these three schools . The College of Health Sciences , established in 1975, traces its origins to the School of Medical Technology sponsored by Presbyterian-St . Luke's Hospital from 1959 to 1972 . This school was the second largest of its kind in the city of Chicago . During its operation, it provided a one-year profes - sional internship program to more than 200 baccalaureate students in medical technology . Today the College of Health Sciences offers doctoral programs in audiology and health sciences, 10 programs at the master's level, and bachelor's programs in health sciences, imaging sciences and vascular ultrasound technology . The Graduate College was established as a separate aca - demic unit in January 1981, having previously been orga - nized as the Graduate School within the College of Health Sciences . The Graduate College is responsible for educa - tional efforts in the basic sciences and offers three master's degree programs and one doctoral degree program .6 7 2023-2024 2023-2024 RUSH University Catalog RUSH University CatalogUniversity Offices Office of the Provost The provost is the chief operating officer of the University, committed to advancing our mission through outstand - ing health sciences education and impactful research in a culture of inclusion, health promotion and diversity, while upholding the University core values of innovation, collabo - ration, accountability, respect and excellence .

Inappropriate Degree Usage A student may not indicate they have earned a specific degree or certificate from RUSH University until the follow - ing have been fulfilled: All degree or certificate requirements have been success - fully completed Completed Degree Approval and Intent to Graduate forms have been submitted to the Office of the Registrar The official date of graduation for a particular term has been reached The degree or certificate has been officially conferred by the Office of the Registrar A student who disregards this policy will be referred to the committee that addresses professional ethics violations for that student's program or college . In order to maintain an active status, RUSH University requires continuous enrollment in the majority of its academic programs from the time a student matriculates through a student's graduation . Exemptions for the sum - mer term only include Health Systems Management majors . Students who are not officially enrolled each term or have not submitted a Petition for Leave of Absence or Voluntary Withdrawal form risk being administratively withdrawn from the University by the Office of the Registrar .A student enrolled in a noncredit residency or academic enrichment program prior to receipt of a degree must be registered for their program's Continuous Enrollment course to retain active student status .

A student who is auditing a course and is not allowed in other courses during the same term must register for their program's Continuous Enrollment course to be charged appropriately . Credit by Proficiency A student who passes a proficiency examination at RUSH University will earn academic credit toward the degree . Programs have the discretion to offer credit by proficiency (e .g ., standardized examinations, such as ACT Proficiency Examination Program (PEP) Challenge or Advanced Placement (AP) exams and/or achieved prior learning (such as continuing education units) . RUSH Medical College does not offer credit by proficiency . Credit awarded by proficiency and/or achieved prior learning is based on documented equivalence with courses offered by the program . The minimum standards and format for demonstrating proficiency are determined by program faculty . Formats for demonstrating proficiency may include departmentally-developed examinations, licensure/certifica - tion exams, portfolios and competency demonstrations . Credit awarded by proficiency and/or achieved prior learn - ing will equal the credit value of the course(s) as listed in the RUSH University Catalog under which the student matriculated . Information that is posted on the transcript for approved credit is the prefix, number and title of the course, the credits awarded and a K grade . Credit awarded by proficiency will appear on the transcript in the appropriate term the credit was earned . Credit for achieved prior learning will appear on the transcript in the student's term of matriculation . Credit earned by these mechanisms will not be used in calculating the student's grade-point average . The student's program reserves the right to assess a fee or partial tuition based on what the student would have been charged .Academic Credit Academic credit is awarded to a student upon the success - ful completion of an approved instructional course or by the demonstration of competencies, proficiencies or fulfillment of learning outcomes equivalent to that provided by an approved instructional course . One unit of academic credit is the measure of the total time commitment a typical student is expected to devote to learning per week of study . Total time devoted to learning includes but is not limited to: classroom or faculty instruction in either a synchronous or asynchronous mode; time devoted to individual conferences with instructors; reading and completion of learning activi - ties and assignments; posting in online discussion folders; performance demonstrations; examinations; work associ - ated with completion capstone assignments, thesis, or dissertations; laboratory work; clinical practica; or any other activity required of the student . One hour of credit is an amount of work represented in intended learning outcomes and verified by evidence of student achievement that reasonably approximates not less than one hour classroom or direct faculty instruction and a minimum of two hours of out of class student work each week for approximately 15 weeks for one semester or one tri - mester hour of credit or the equivalent of at least 37 .5 hours of work for one semester or one trimester hour of credit . In this context, an hour of work is defined as 50 minutes . Exceptions: Course credit hours are not calculated for RUSH Medical College. RUSH Medical College (RMC): RUSH Medical College uses weeks of instruction to measure student credit, which can be converted to credit hours using the criteria below . The RMC medical program is accredited by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME), an accrediting program review body for medical programs in the United States and Canada . LCME requires all accredited medical education programs leading to the Doctor of Medicine (MD) to include a minimum of 130 weeks of instruction . RMC's curriculum requirement of 164 hours of instruction over four years exceed those as outlined in the LCME Standards of Accreditation of Medical Education Programs leading to the MD degree . The conversion for instructional weeks to credit hours is as follows: Courses in the first two years of the RUSH Medical College curriculum are a uniform structure for educational experi - ences and contact hours . These contact hours comprise small group learning experiences, laboratories, simulated and real patient encounters . The RMC curriculum is pre - sented in a flipped methodology with a minimum require - ment of two hours of outside-of-class preparation for each hour of classroom instruction . In the preclerkship curriculum, the average contact time for students each week is approximately 14 hours . Based on a 16-week calendar (eight weeks in the summer for M1) and a class time of 50 minutes, the equivalency of one preclerk - ship week is equivalent to one credit hour . Year 1 = 40 full-time weeks (equivalent to 40 credit hours) Year 2 = 32 full-time weeks (equivalent to 32 credit hours) Total = 72 credit hours In year three and four of the clinical experience, contact hours increase for clerkship and electives . Students earn the equivalent of one semester credit hour for each 40-70 contact hours of clinical experiences . Year 3 = 48 full-time weeks (equivalent to 48 credit hours) Year 4 = 44 full-time weeks (equivalent to 48 credit hours) Total = 96 credit hours Grade-Point Average Transfer credits from institutions outside of RUSH University are not included in the grade-point average, or GPA, cal - culation . Transfer credits internal to RUSH University are included in the GPA calculation . Separate GPAs are calcu - lated for a student's undergraduate and graduate records . The GPA is calculated using all grades in courses that could count toward the program . The GPA is reset from 0 .00 when a student successfully completes a program and matricu - lates into a new program at the graduate or professional level . Transcripts show the GPA for each term in which grade points are earned and show a cumulative GPA for all work taken at RUSH University for each program degree level . When a course is repeated, only the most recent attempt is computed in the GPA, though all grades will display on the transcript . No grade points are assigned for work taken on a pass/ no-pass basis, and therefore such work is not computed in the GPA . A GPA is not reported for RUSH Medical College students . Undergraduate students who are required to enroll in courses that typically are taught at the graduate level will have these courses count toward their undergraduate programs of study; thus, the credits and grade points will be calculated as part of the undergraduate transcript .36 37 2023-2024 2023-2024 RUSH University Catalog RUSH University CatalogGrade Report Students can access their grade report/unofficial transcript via the RUSH University Portal . Grade reports are not mailed to students .

Privacy and Confidentiality of Student Records and FERPA RUSH University takes seriously its commitment to protect the privacy of its students and their education records . In addition to upholding the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, or FERPA, RUSH University has taken further steps to protect privacy by extending similar ben - efits afforded to enrolled students under FERPA to individu - als who are applying for admission . If a specific privacy or confidentiality question is not answered in this text, please contact the Office of the Registrar . Nothing in this policy may be construed to prohibit the University from disclosing information provided to the institu - tion under the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act concerning sex offenders who are required to register . Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA) FERPA is a federal law designed to protect the privacy of students' educational records . Educational records are those that contain information or documentation directly related to a student that is recorded in any way, including records produced by handwriting, computer, email, audio, video, etc . Educational records contain information directly related to a student and are maintained by RUSH University or any party acting on its behalf . FERPA protects the privacy of students' educational records by setting strict instructions and limitations governing the release of information about students . Though FERPA contains exceptions for the release of directory information without a student's prior written consent, students have the right to request that even directory information be withheld from disclosure to third parties . Given the restrictions of FERPA, faculty and staff should assume all students must provide written consent that fol - lows the format specified in FERPA before any educational records may be released to anyone other than the student . Without written consent, information cannot be released to any third party, including students' parents, relatives and friends . Particularly sensitive information includes students' Social Security numbers, race or ethnicity, gender, national - ity, academic performance, disciplinary records, financial aid information and grades . Privacy During the Admissions Process RUSH University has chosen to take additional steps to protect a person's privacy by extending to individuals who are applying for admission similar benefits afforded to enrolled students . This privacy protection covers all applicants and their application materials throughout the admissions process . The application process exists between the applicant and a RUSH University admissions office; therefore, any com - munication about candidates and their application status to parties beyond these entities is not acceptable unless school officials have a legitimate educational interest to know this information in order to fulfill their professional responsibilities . All those involved in the admissions process (e . g ., admissions committee members, interviewers, admissions staff) must adhere to these guidelines .Directory Information RUSH University may establish categories of information known as directory information and release this information without student consent, upon request . RUSH University designates the following personally identifiable informa - tion contained in a student's educational record as directory information: Student's full name Address (local and permanent) Telephone number (local and permanent) RUSH pager number (relevant to third- and fourth-year RUSH Medical College students only) RUSH email address Major and minor field(s) of study, including the college, division, department and/or program in which the student is enrolled Student's classification (e . g ., junior, senior) or by number referring to such Dates of attendance and graduation, and degrees received Date and place of birth Photograph or other electronic images* Honors and awards received Previous colleges/universities attended Degrees earned at previous colleges/universities RUSH Medical College postgraduate appointment (pro - gram, institution and state) Students may restrict the release of their directory informa - tion by completing and submitting the directory information restrictions form available on the Office of the Registrar's webpage . The decision to restrict directory information will apply to all requests from third parties (other than those who already have legal access to these data elements), including prospec - tive employers . A student must formally rescind a restriction of directory information by submitting a subsequent directory information restrictions form . * RUSH University records both visually and audibly many campus events and daily activities, such as classes, com - mencement, convocations, student events and other public occasions. These images, as well as other information about students, are published (e.g., print media; RUSH website) regularly as part of the University's coverage of campus life and portrayal of the University to a variety of audiences. The University's policy is to restrict the use of any photograph/electronic image to the representation, marketing or promotion of RUSH activities only.46 47 2023-2024 2023-2024 RUSH University Catalog RUSH University CatalogAnnual Notification of Student Rights Under FERPA RUSH University notifies students annually of their rights under FERPA with respect to their educational records . These rights include the following: 1. The right to inspect and review the student's educa - tional records within 45 days of the day the University receives a request for access. If an educational record contains information about other students as well, the requesting student may inspect and review only their specific information. Students should submit written requests that identify the record(s) they wish to inspect to the University regis - trar, dean, head of the academic department or another appropriate official . The University official will make arrangements for access and notify the student of the time and place for record inspection .

Students returning to campus, engaging in learning experiences and participat - ing in Clinical Programs (referred to herein as \"Students\") knowingly and voluntarily subject themselves to certain risks related to healthcare education . RUSH and its Clinical Partners are taking certain precautions and ensuring that all Students are aware of the potential risks inherent to returning to campus, attending classes or other learning experiences, and participation in Clinical Programs . Students voluntarily and willingly assume certain risks in returning to campus, attending classes, and par - ticipating in and completing Clinical Programs, which are completed for their own benefit . Aware of the foregoing, I am voluntarily returning to the campus of RUSH and/or Clinical Partners . There is a potential risk inherent in returning to campus, attending classes or other learning experiences, and/or par - ticipating in Clinical Programs . Students may be exposed to and/or care for patients who are ill with infectious diseases, and as a result may be at heightened risk for contract - ing infectious diseases . Students may also be exposed to infectious disease through exposure from other members of the RUSH community, including students, faculty, staff and patients . Students will be required to comply with any and all safety precautions and guidelines set forth by RUSH, including the RUSH University COVID-19 Vaccination Policy, and for Students who are participating in Clinical Programs (referred to herein as \"Student Participants\"), additional safety precautions and guidelines set forth by RUSH and/ or the Clinical Partner at which the Student is completing a Clinical Program . Such precautions and guidelines may be updated at any time . In particular, Student Participants who are working with or around patients who have or may have certain infectious diseases, or who have been other - wise directed to do so by RUSH or a Clinical Partner, may be required to wear personal protective equipment (\"PPE\") . Student Participants are solely responsible for notifying the Clinical Partner and RUSH (through the relevant Program Director or supervising faculty member) if PPE has not been 48 49 2023-2024 2023-2024 RUSH University Catalog RUSH University Catalogprovided . Student Participants are solely responsible for using PPE correctly, and for following any other require - ments set forth by RUSH and/or Clinical Partners . Student Participants are also required to comply with any best prac - tices related to the provision of health care generally (e . g ., hand-washing, mask wearing, and social distancing), and related to the transmission of infectious diseases and are solely responsible for asking RUSH and/or Clinical Partners for any further guidance necessary related to such best practices . PPE and other precautions cannot fully eliminate the risk of transmission of infectious disease . All Students are ultimately responsible for their own health . RUSH stands ready to assist any Student, as requested, in complying with these requirements . All Students must acknowledge these responsibilities and the inherent risks of returning to campus, engaging in learn - ing experiences and attending class, and participating in Clinical Programs prior to resuming such participation . IN CONSIDERATION of being given the opportunity to return to campus, engage in and attend class or other learning experiences, and/or complete Clinical Programs at RUSH University and its Clinical Partners, I understand and acknowledge the following: 1) There is potential risk inherent in returning to campus, attending classes or other learning experiences, and/ or participating in Clinical Programs . I understand and acknowledge that I may be around and/or care for individ - uals that are ill and therefore may be exposed to diseases known or unknown . I am willing to assume that risk . 2) My return to campus and/or participation in the Clinical Program is to benefit my knowledge, experience and improve my abilities and therefore purely voluntary on my part . 3) I acknowledge that RUSH University has published a COVID-19 Vaccination Policy (the \"Vaccination Policy\") requiring all students returning to campus to be fully vac - cinated against COVID-19 unless they have an authorized exemption . I assume responsibility for complying with the requirements of the Vaccination Policy . 4) I assume responsibility for complying with any safety guidelines set forth by RUSH University (and the Colleges within), RUSH University Medical Center, and/or a Clinical Partner, including as related to the use of personal pro - tective equipment (\"PPE\") . I acknowledge that the use of PPE and other safety precautions does not fully elimi - nate any risk inherent to returning to campus, attending classes or other learning experiences, and participation in the Clinical Program . I acknowledge that I should not return to campus if I cannot comply with the safety guide - lines set forth by RUSH related to presence on campus and attendance in class, academic events, or other learn - ing opportunities . I acknowledge that if I am participating in a Clinical Program, I am responsible for informing both RUSH University (through the relevant program director or supervising faculty member) and the Clinical Partner at which I am completing a Clinical Program if I lack the necessary PPE or cannot for any reason comply with safety precautions . I voluntarily assume this responsibility and the related risk . 5) I understand that in the event I am injured or ill in relation to exposure to illness on campus, I am responsible for notifying the relevant program director or supervising faculty member at RUSH University . I understand that in the event I am injured or ill in relation to the activities I engaged in during the Clinical Program, I am responsible for notifying the relevant program director or supervising faculty member at RUSH University . I further understand that I will be responsible for the costs associated with any such exposure, illness, or injury, to include any follow up care that might be needed . I voluntarily assume this responsibility . I understand that I must comply with the applicable COVID-19 guidelines . 6) I understand that RUSH is planning a flexible model of instruction and may provide fully online and/or remote instruction if necessary . Under this flexible model, RUSH currently intends that instruction will be a hybrid of in-person and online modalities; however, the model is designed to pivot to a fully online/remote modality if necessary to help ensure health and safety of the RUSH community, in line with recommendations from public health entities . I understand that compliance with the expectations set forth in this document is an educational responsibility with which I, as a student at RUSH, and a professional responsibility with which I, as a future healthcare worker, agree to abide . I am freely and voluntarily entering into this assumption of risk .Drug and Alcohol-Free Campus RUSH University and RUSH University Medical Center (here - inafter, collectively referred to as RUSH) comply with all state and federal regulations concerning drugs and alcohol . Violations of the Drug and Alcohol-Free Campus policy include but are not limited to the following: unauthorized use, possession or sale of drugs, alcohol or other controlled substances on RUSH premises, including the smoking or vaping of cannabis . For additional information, please see RUSH's Drug and Alcohol-Free Campus Policy HR-A 8 .00 . Tobacco-Free Campus RUSH seeks to promote the health, safety and quality of life of all members of the RUSH community . To that end, RUSH is a smoke and tobacco-free campus . For additional informa - tion, please see RUSH's Tobacco Free Work Environment Policy . Diversity, Equal Opportunity and Inclusion For over three decades, the RUSH approach to equal opportunity, diversity and inclusion has not wavered . Our approach is that these are essential components of the best employment, educational and health care practices and must be furthered . This is a continuation of a policy that emanated from the hospital charters of 1865 and 1883 and the documents governing the establishment of RUSH University in 1972 . In certain instances, the implementation of this policy and our goals in this area require the use of affirmative initia - tives . At RUSH, these initiatives are focused on strong recruitment, development and retention efforts-not on quotas-and these recruitment and programming efforts will be continued, consistent with federal, state and municipal guidelines . RUSH is committed to attracting students who will enable the student body to achieve the educational benefits of diversity and to providing services to all students, faculty and employees on a nondiscriminatory, equitable basis .

RUSH strives to have an environment that is free from unlawful sexual harassment . RUSH complies with Title IX of the Higher Education Amendments of 1972 and its implementing regulations, which prohibit sexual harass - ment that occurs within its education programs or activities . sexual harassment includes quid pro quo sexual harassment, hostile environment sexual harassment, sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking . RUSH has a legal duty to prevent and redress sexual harass - ment that occurs within its education programs or activities, as well as a moral and ethical duty to do so . Indeed, such conduct is contrary to RUSH's values, represents profes - sionally and socially irresponsible behavior; and can damage the trust, influence and reputation of RUSH and the medi - cal profession . Moreover, because RUSH's primary mission of furthering the public good relies on maintaining public trust and confidence, it is essential that every member of the RUSH community share in the responsibility for meeting our community's conduct expectations . It is equally impor - tant that members of our community appreciate the impact sexual harassment that occurs within RUSH's education programs or activities can have on our environment, and the potential for severe consequences for such behavior .50 51 2023-2024 2023-2024 RUSH University Catalog RUSH University CatalogPolicy Statement Members of the RUSH Community who commit sexual harassment are subject to the full range of discipline including verbal reprimand, written reprimand, mandatory training or counseling, mandatory monitoring, partial or full probation, partial or full suspension, permanent separation from the institution (i . e ., termination or dismissal), physical restriction from RUSH property, cancellation of contracts and any combination of the same .

All RUSH University students enrolled in degree programs from College of Nursing, College of Health Sciences and Graduate College may opt out of the student health insurance by providing proof of existing coverage during their first term of enroll - ment (during the health insurance open enrollment and waiver period) and then every fall term thereafter . Students are required to take action during the fall open enrollment and waiver period . All medical students must complete the student health insurance waiver or enrollment process during the fall term . All communication from the Student Business Office regarding student health insurance open enroll - ment and waiver periods are sent to RUSH email addresses . Students are expected to check their RUSH email account regularly and take action during those periods regarding sub - mitting waivers or enrolling in the student health insurance .Students who do not submit proof of alternate coverage will automatically be enrolled in the student health insurance plan and charged the premiums for the term . All students enrolled in degree programs are eligible for the student health insurance plan offered by Academic Health Plans and Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Illinois . For the 2023-2024 school year, the cost of the student health insurance plan is approximately $5,818 per academic year for single coverage . The total annual coverage amount is allocated and billed onto the student's account on a per-term basis . Coverage is also available for dependents at the rate of approximately $5,818 annually per dependent . The total annual coverage amount for dependents is also allocated and billed onto the student's account on a per- term basis . This plan allows students to choose a primary care physician from a large list of members of the preferred provider organization, or PPO, plan in the greater Chicago area . When using an in-network provider, there is an annual deductible of $500 and coverage of 80% for most patient services, including hospitalization and surgery, as well as outpatient services such as office visits, laboratory and X-ray . Preventative care services are covered at 100% . When using a pharmacy in the Prime Therapeutics network, there is a $20 co-pay for each generic prescription, a $50 copay for each brand-name prescription and an $80 copay for each non-preferred brand-name prescription . Student Plan Rates for the 2023-2024 Academic Yearprovide medical students with acute care . By using RUSH University Health Insurance, medical students receive an enhanced level of service and minimal billing issues, with a $20 fee per office visit . This will provide the type of student health service familiar to most students . Additionally, all RUSH Medical College students are covered under a blood and bodily fluids exposure rider . This works as a supplemental policy to any health insurance and covers treatment or medications necessary as the result of a needle stick, splash or potentially contagious disease exposure . Together with the basic RUSH University Health Insurance policy, the rider will completely cover prophylactic medica - tions or injections . RUSH Medical College students will be assessed a fee for vaccinations, immunizations and documentation . This fee covers any necessary blood tests, vaccinations or updates, as well as costs associated with maintaining the documenta - tion of students' compliance and communicating that infor - mation to the RUSH System hospitals and any non-RUSH locations that may request certification of immunization and vaccination status . Tuition Refund Policy The Student Refund Policy provides students an opportunity to formally withdraw prior to the start date of an academic term without being responsible for tuition . Students decid - ing to withdraw after the official start date of the term will be refunded according to the tuition schedule in the University Student Refund policy located in the Academic and University Policies section in this catalog . Students are responsible for any tuition or fee balances due until they are formally notified by RUSH University in writing of their withdrawal status . Tuition Waivers Doctoral students in the Graduate College Select students will be offered competitive financial support, which may include a tuition scholarship, health insurance and/or a monthly stipend . Details will be communicated in the offer of admission letter . Please note that non-U .S . resi - dents are not eligible for Graduate College stipend support . To receive financial support, you must maintain full-time status-at least nine credit hours per term . If you do not reg - ister for nine credit hours per term, the scholarship will be rescinded, and you will be billed for tuition .

Office of Student Financial Aid Financial Aid Process Instructions for accessing financial aid information on the RUSH University website are emailed to all newly accepted students upon completion of required financial aid paper - work . The Student Financial Aid webpage contains in-depth information on policies, procedures and financial aid award - ing methodology . Students starting in a term other than fall should submit financial aid application materials at least two months prior to their start date to allow sufficient time to receive their aid package . Students must be enrolled at least half-time 4 . 5 credit hours for graduate/professional students and 6 credit hours for undergraduate students and must be in a degree or approved certificate program and meet all required eligibil - ity requirements to receive federal financial aid . To receive assistance, all appropriate forms must be on file . Students should expect to receive the majority of assis - tance in the form of loans . Because of limited institutional funding, financial aid packages will likely contain loans that accrue interest while the student is in school . For RUSH Medical College students and College of Nursing students in the Generalist Entry Master's program, need-based grant and scholarship assistance is available through the Office of Student Financial Aid; funds are limited, so students are encouraged to submit all required financial aid paperwork early . All RUSH Medical College applicants who will be under 30 years old prior to the start of their program must provide parent(s) financial information on the FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) at studentaid . gov and meet the institutional criteria for eligibility . Visit the Office of Student Financial Aid webpage for more details: www .rushu . rush . edu/office-student-financial-aid . Undergraduate students who have not earned a bachelor's degree may be eligible to receive grant assistance through federal and state need-based programs . Employment through the Federal Work-Study program may be possible through - out RUSH University Medical Center and its affiliates . Once eligibility has been determined and a campus job identified, Federal Work-Study is awarded as part of the financial aid package . It is the student's responsibility to secure employ - ment . The Office of Student Financial Aid is available to assist students with locating jobs within the University if requested . Financial Aid Determination Financial aid packages at RUSH University are provided to assist students to pay for the cost of education . Financial need is the basic criterion for the awarding of funds and the student must complete a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) at studentaid . gov each year to deter - mine need and eligibility . Students and family members will be expected to contribute toward educational expenses . The level of the expected contribution is determined by using a standard set of criteria to determine eligibility from informa - tion provided on the FAFSA at studentaid . gov . Submission of Parent Information for consideration of need based institutional grants, scholarships and loans is required for RUSH Medical College students and any dependent undergraduate students . Complete information about this policy can be found on the Office of Student Financial Aid webpage . Student financial aid counselors are available to consult and assist students and parents (with the student's authorization) with questions about financial aid packages and awards and services for a RUSH University education . Students and authorized parents are encouraged to make use of these services . Financial Aid Awards After evaluating student and family resources in addition to assistance from outside the University, the Office of Student Financial Aid will award students the federal, state and insti - tutional funds they qualify for each academic year . In order to distribute available funds in the most equitable manner, the Office of Student Financial Aid establishes a formula that designates the sequence in which funds are awarded to stu - dents, as well as the maximum amount awarded under each program . These formulas are applied consistently during any given year among all students at a given class level and in a given college, pending availability of funds . The formulas may be adjusted annually due to differences in the avail - ability of funds from year to year and changes in eligibility requirements . Veterans Benefits RUSH University participates in federal veteran's education benefits . Post-9/11 GI Bill\u00ae The Post-9/11 GI Bill\u00ae provides tuition, fees, books/supplies and housing assistance to eligible veterans . Tuition and fees are paid directly to RUSH by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) . Tuition and fees assistance is capped at the national maximum of $27,120 .05 per academic year (Aug . 1, 2023 - July 31, 2024) . Benefit rates vary based on the veteran's circumstances . Some veterans may be able to transfer their benefits to a dependent . Yellow Ribbon Program Starting in the 2012-13 academic year, certain colleges at RUSH University participate in the Yellow Ribbon Program . Veterans entitled to the maximum benefit rate are eligible to apply for additional tuition and fee amounts if their costs exceed the $27,120 .05 cap . The amount of additional assistance available and the number of students able to be supported is limited and varies by college . Funds are awarded on a first-come, first-served basis . Students who have received Yellow Ribbon assistance will have preference for these funds in future academic years . Details are available on the VA's Yellow Ribbon Program information webpage .62 63 2023-2024 2023-2024 RUSH University Catalog RUSH University CatalogMontgomery GI GI Bill\u00ae-Active Duty (MGIB-AD Chapter 30) Montgomery GI Bill\u00ae-Selected Reserve (MGIB-SR Chapter 1606) Veterans Educational Assistance Program (VEAP Chapter 32) Survivors and Dependents Assistance (DEA Chapter 35) If a student qualifies for participation in more than one vet - erans education benefits program, the VA website provides a comparison tool to help determine which benefits might be appropriate .

VA Pending Payment As of Aug . 1, 2019, RUSH University will not take any of the four following actions toward any student using VA Post 9/11 G .I . Bill\u00ae (Ch . 33) or Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (Ch . 31) benefits, while their payment from the VA is pending to the educational institution: Prevent their enrollment Assess a late penalty fee to Require they secure alternative or additional funding Deny their access to any resources (access to classes, libraries or other institutional facilities) available to other students who have satisfied their tuition and fee bills to the institution . However, to qualify for this provision, such students may be required to produce the following: The VA's certificate of eligibility by the first day of class Written request to be certified Additional information needed to properly certify the enrollment as described in other institutional policies (see our VA school certifying official for all requirements) . Satisfactory Academic Progress The Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended by Congress, mandates institutions of higher education to establish minimum standards of satisfactory progress for students receiving federal financial aid . These standards apply to all federal Title IV aid programs, including the Federal Pell Grant, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant, Federal Perkins Loan, Federal Stafford Loan, Federal PLUS Loan and Federal College Work-Study programs . Accordingly, the Department of Education regulations require that RUSH University's Office of Student Financial Aid monitor the academic progress of all financial aid recipi - ents toward the completion of their degree . This process is called Satisfactory Academic Progress, or SAP . This SAP policy is enforced in conjunction with all other institutional policies and procedures, including the academic progressions policies of RUSH University's colleges and aca - demic programs . For undergraduate and graduate students, the below criteria are checked at the end of each term . For medical students, the below criteria are checked annually at the end of spring term . The Office of Student Financial Aid will factor in rounding up to two digits (66 .67%) when calculating a student's eligibility for meeting the minimum pace of completion requirements . Enforcement The Office of Student Financial Aid has the primary responsibility in enforcing the SAP policy . The Office of the Registrar and other RUSH University offices that maintain student information relevant to the SAP policy shall provide such information, as requested by the Office of Student Financial Aid .SAP Requirements SAP requirements vary by academic level (undergraduate, graduate and medical students) . Please refer to the appropri - ate section to find the requirements that fit your academic program . UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS SAP for undergraduate students is monitored using three factors: maximum time frame measurement, pace of comple - tion and cumulative grade-point average, or GPA . SAP is measured at the end of each academic term once final grades are submitted . Maximum Time Frame Measurement Students may attempt up to 150% of the credits it nor - mally takes to complete the program . The total allowable attempted hours are calculated by multiplying the hours required to complete the degree at RUSH (including the general education courses required prior to entry in the program) by 1 . 5 and rounding down to the nearest whole number . For example, for a program that requires 107 credit hours to receive a degree at RUSH (including the general education courses required prior to entry in the program), a student may attempt up to 160 hours . Pace of Completion (POC) Students must successfully complete at least 66 .667% of the courses they attempt . This will be measured cumulatively over the course of the student's program . For the purpose of this measurement, all of the following are applicable: Successful completion is defined as a grade of A, B or C for a letter grade course or a grade of P for a course that is pass/fail or pass/no pass . These courses are counted in both the attempted and completed hours totals . All other grades, including incomplete grades, are counted in the attempted hours total but not in the completed hours total . If an incomplete grade is later converted to a grade that is considered to be a successfully completed grade, the pace of completion percentage can be recalcu - lated . It is the student's responsibility to notify the Office of Student Financial Aid when an incomplete grade has been converted . Students who drop courses prior to the close of the published add/drop period each term will not have those dropped courses counted in the total attempted hours . Dropped courses after the close of the published add/drop period will be counted in the total attempted hours . Repeated courses are counted as attempted hours during all attempts . Transfer credits (including the general education courses required prior to entry in the program) that count toward the student's current academic program count as both attempted and completed hours . Students who change majors at the same degree level will only have hours that were previously attempted counted in their cumulative totals if they are applicable to the new academic program . Cumulative Grade-Point Average Undergraduate students must maintain a minimum cumula - tive GPA of 2 .0 . Students who have a term GPA of less than 1 .0 after their first term at RUSH will be immediately placed on financial aid suspension . GRADUATE STUDENTS SAP for graduate students is monitored using three factors: maximum time frame measurement, pace of completion and cumulative GPA . SAP is measured at the end of each academic term once final grades are submitted . Maximum Time Frame Measurement Students may attempt up to 150% of the credits it nor - mally takes to complete their program . The total allow - able attempted hours are calculated by multiplying the hours required to complete the degree at RUSH by 1 . 5 and rounding down to the nearest whole number . For example, a student may attempt up to 169 hours for a program that requires 113 credit hours to receive a degree at RUSH . Please note: Non-degree certificate programs are approved by the U .S . Department of Education for financial assistance at a specific number of credit hours . Regardless of a stu - dent's actual plan of study, maximum time frame is calcu - lated using the number of hours for which the program was approved with the U .S . Department of Education . Pace of Completion (POC) Students must successfully complete at least 66 .667% of the courses they attempt . This will be measured cumulatively over the course of the student's program . For the purpose of this measurement, all of the following are applicable: Successful completion is defined as a grade of A or B for a letter grade course or a grade of P for a course that is pass/fail or pass/no pass . These courses are counted in both the attempted and completed hours totals . All other grades, including incomplete grades, are counted in the attempted hours total, but not in the completed hours total . If an incomplete grade is later con - verted to a grade that is considered to be a successfully completed grade, the pace of completion percentage can 64 65 2023-2024 2023-2024 RUSH University Catalog RUSH University Catalogbe recalculated . It is the student's responsibility to notify the Office of Student Financial Aid when an incomplete grade has been converted . Students who drop courses prior to the close of the published add/drop period each term will not have those dropped courses counted in the total attempted hours . Dropped courses after the close of the published add/ drop period will be counted in the total attempted hours . Repeated courses are counted as attempted hours during all attempts . Transfer credits that count toward the student's current academic program count as both attempted and com - pleted hours . Students who change majors at the same degree level will only have hours that were previously attempted counted in their cumulative totals if they are applicable to the new academic program . Cumulative Grade-Point Average Graduate students must maintain a minimum cumulative GPA of 3 .0 . Students who have a GPA of less than 2 .0 after their first term at RUSH will be immediately placed on finan - cial aid suspension . RUSH MEDICAL COLLEGE STUDENTS SAP for RUSH Medical College students is monitored using three factors: maximum time frame measurement, pace of completion and grade requirements . SAP is measured at the end of each academic year once final grades are in and at the time of awarding . Maximum Time Frame Measurement The normal time frame for completion of required course - work for the MD degree is four academic years . Due to academic or personal difficulties, a student may require additional time . In such situations, the RUSH Medical College Committee on Student Evaluation and Promotion (COSEP) may establish a schedule for the student that departs from the norm and may require repeating a year of study . For the purposes of this financial aid policy, no more than three cohort years may be devoted to the first- and second-year curriculum and no more than three cohort years may be devoted to the third- and fourth-year curriculum, for a maximum time frame of six cohort years . Summer enroll - ment, if required, is considered part of the academic year for the purposes of this measure . Terms under an approved LOA do not count in this measure .Pace of Completion (POC) 1 . First-year students must complete at least 66 .667% of their first-year curriculum with a grade of Pass (P), High Pass (HP) or Honors (H) during the cohort year . This includes repeated courses . 2 . Second-year students must complete at least 66 .667% of their second-year curriculum with a grade of Pass (P), High Pass (HP) or Honors (H) during the cohort year . This includes repeated courses . 3 . Third-year students must complete at least 66 .667% of the clerkships they attempt with a grade of Pass (P), High Pass (HP) or Honors (H) during the cohort year . Grade Requirements RUSH Medical College academic progress is measured in terms of Honors, High Pass, Pass and Fail grades . A student must complete each required course/clerkship with a grade of Pass or better in order to graduate . A student who fails a course must retake it and earn a grade of at least Pass . A student who receives an Incomplete in a course must com - plete the course and earn at least a Pass . Financial Aid Warning Undergraduate and graduate students are allowed a finan - cial aid warning period . Professional students enrolled at RUSH Medical College are not allowed a financial aid warn - ing period . Undergraduate or graduate students who fail to meet the requirements of this satisfactory academic progress policy will be placed on financial aid warning for one term, with the exception of undergraduate students who have a first-term GPA of less than 1 . 0 and graduate students who have a first- term GPA of less than 2 .0 . In this case, that student would immediately be placed on financial aid suspension . Students will be allowed to continue on financial assistance during the warning period . Students placed on financial aid warning will receive a notification through their RUSH email account . The notification will include SAP requirements, steps necessary to meet SAP in the upcoming term and the consequences for failing to meet SAP requirements by the end of the warn - ing period . Students will be placed on financial aid suspension if they fail to meet the standards of this SAP policy after the one- term financial aid warning period .Suspension of Financial Aid Eligibility Professional students enrolled at RUSH Medical College who fail to meet the requirements of this SAP policy will be placed on financial aid suspension . Undergraduate students who have a first-term GPA of less than 1 . 0 and graduate students who have a first- term GPA of less than 2 .0 will be placed on financial aid suspension . Students who still fail to meet the requirements of this policy after their single term on financial aid warning will be placed on financial aid suspension . Students who are suspended from financial aid eligibility will be notified through their RUSH email account . Appealing Suspension of Financial Aid Eligibility Under extenuating circumstances, a student may appeal the suspension of their financial aid eligibility . Appeals from other parties on behalf of the student will not be accepted . All appeals should be submitted to the Office of Student Financial Aid in writing or by email to financial_aid@rush . edu . Each appeal should include the following items: Signed letter from the student indicating the reasons why the standards of this policy were not met and what has changed in the student's situation that will allow satisfac - tory progress during the next evaluation period An academic plan for the remainder of the student's studies Any supporting documentation the student feels would support the appeal (as appropriate) The Office of Student Financial Aid will review the appeal and notify the student of the appeal review results . Students whose appeals are approved will be placed on a financial aid probationary period for one term or for an appropriate dura - tion depending on the academic plan provided . If applicable, the probationary period will be defined to include checkpoints that must be achieved in order for the student to remain eligible for financial assistance . Students failing to abide by the terms of their probationary period will be suspended from financial aid after the one-term proba - tionary period or in the case of a multi-term probationary period upon failure to maintain the minimum requirements of the probationary period requirements . The decision of the Office of Student Financial Aid is final, binding and not subject to further appeal .Reinstatement of Financial Aid Eligibility A student's eligibility for financial aid will be reinstated when the standards of the SAP policy as outlined above have been successfully met .

As a member of the AAMC, we are further guided by the AAMC's Group on Diversity and Inclusion definitions: Diversity as a core value \"embodies inclusiveness, mutual respect, and multiple perspectives and serves as a catalyst for change resulting in health equity . In this context, we are mindful of all aspects of human differences, such as socioeconomic status, race, ethnicity, language, nationality, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, religion, geography, disability and age . \" Recognizing the importance of addressing the issues related to those historically underrepresented in medicine and never losing sight of the ultimate goals of providing care to the underserved, promoting health equity, and eliminating health disparities, RUSH Medical College seeks to recruit, retain and develop a student body and physician workforce that will advance diversity across the entire professional spec - trum of medical education . \"Inclusion is a core element for successfully achieving diversity . Inclusion is achieved by nurturing the climate and culture of the institution through professional development, education, policy and practice . The objective is creating a climate that fosters belonging, respect, and value for all and encourages engagement and connection throughout the institution and community .\" RUSH Medical College, appreciating that diversity and inclusion enhances the medical education environment and ultimately the overall health of our community, strives to create and support an environment where faculty, residents, fellows, staff, and medical students combine their differing backgrounds, diverse perspectives, and unique skills as they work with peers to solve problems, enhance their ability to work with patients, and develop new, effective ways to man - age health, conduct research, and deliver quality care .

Utilizing information provided by the Office of Integrated Medical Education and other data, RUSH Medical College's Faculty Council is committed to implementing institutional policies, procedures, programs, and initiatives designed to meet these stated diversity goals . Professionalism Statement and Standards Overview \"Professionalism is the basis of the medicine's contract with society .\" So begins the preamble to the American Board of Internal Medicine's Physician Charter, a widely recognized and endorsed document detailing the roles and responsi - bilities of the modern physician in practice towards their patients, profession and society . It has been recognized for decades in American undergraduate medical education that not only does professionalism need to be modeled in the clinical setting, but taught and assessed throughout training, starting from entry to medical school . Developing and refining behaviors consistent with exemplary medical professionalism is an acquired skill, which requires teaching from the time of entry into medical school . The expectations for trainees, whether in the undergraduate medical program or graduate medical program, are closely aligned . Furthermore, the expectations of students should be similar, but level-appropriate, to those for attending phy - sicians with regards to medical professionalism and ethically sound behavior . This document specifically defines (1) the value of pro - fessionalism in the RUSH Medical College (RMC) cur - riculum, (2) professionalism standards for RMC students and (3) methods for reporting concerns about student professionalism . 70 71 2023-2024 2023-2024 RUSH University Catalog RUSH University CatalogProfessionalism in the RMC Curriculum The Professional Role curriculum is designed to introduce students to both the fundamentals of medical profession - alism and medical ethics, as well as provide guidance on both exemplary professional behavior and unprofessional student behavior . The teaching in the four-year curriculum is parallel to the routine professional expectations RMC has of students in both clinical practice, administrative respon - sibilities and interpersonal interactions . Professionalism Standards for RMC Students The following expectations are based on medical profes - sionalism guidelines as set forth by the American Board of Internal Medicine Physician Charter . Students are expected to strive to model the highest standards of professionalism as members of the RUSH community, in both RUSH-related activities and activities external to RUSH . Student profes - sionalism is regularly assessed throughout the curriculum in end-of-course evaluations, including narrative evalu - ations . Students are expected to demonstrate profes - sionalism in the following ways as outlined in the RMC Expectations for the Learning Environment: Classroom/Clinical Experiences: Being adequately prepared for learning activities in the classroom, laboratory, research and clinical settings Attending and participating in learning activities in an engaged, punctual and reliable manner Completing all course and administrative requirements as defined by the Office of Integrated Medical Education (OIME), course directors and faculty in a timely manner Dressing and conducting themselves appropriately to the activity in which they are participating, in a manner becoming of a member of the RUSH community Feedback and Evaluation: Actively and appropriately seeking feedback to improve their own performance, accepting constructive feedback openly and without hostility, accepting responsibility for missteps Reflecting on their performance and educational experi - ences to inform their self-directed learning and study Recognizing personal limitations in knowledge, skills, and attitudes, and seeking help from faculty and peers as appropriate Providing constructive feedback and evaluation about the learning environment and educational experiencesInterpersonal Behaviors: Treating faculty, residents, staff and fellow students with respect and collegiality, both in person and via social media and other digital platforms Resolving conflicts in an appropriate and professional manner Patient Care: Treating patients with kindness, compassion and respect, both in person and via social media and other digital platforms Respecting and preserving patient confidentiality as appropriate for patient care through the electronic health record and other digital platforms, and in person Personal Integrity and Academic Honesty: Adhering to the RMC Honor Code, RUSH University Honor Code, and the RUSH University Medical Center Code of Conduct Adhering to the ethical standards of our profession as described by the American Medical Association Acting as models of honesty and integrity at all times, in all interactions with patients, faculty and colleagues Addressing witnessed errors, rule violations and unpro - fessional behavior in a direct and respectful manner, including the reporting of such behaviors to the appropri - ate authority Refraining from use of illicit substances, in accordance with the law Avoiding use of legal or prescribed substances to the point of impairment or dependency Methods for Reporting Professionalism Concerns Various RMC personnel and committees work closely together in the evaluation and remediation of student professionalism concerns . Professionalism concerns can be reported through the following mechanisms: RMC Honor Code Council: The Honor Code Council is a group of peer-elected medical students who review reports of potential Honor Code violations and recom - mend action as appropriate . As per the Honor Code Council Policies and Procedures, reports cannot be anonymous; they must contain the name of both the reporter and the student named in the violation . If an Honor Code violation is found to have occurred, or if the Council is unable to reach a conclusion, the report is passed directly to the Committee on Student Evaluation & Promotion (COSEP) for further evaluation and the final decision on action . Special Committee on the RMC Environment (SCORE): SCORE is another student-run organization which evalu - ates a wide range of reports regarding the learning envi - ronment . SCORE reporting can be anonymous, as per the SCORE Policies and Procedures, although submitters are encouraged to identify themselves to the committee . Occasionally, students submit reports of unprofessional behavior of other students to SCORE . If SCORE deems appropriate, these reports may be passed on to OIME for further evaluation, and subsequently reported to COSEP . RMC Early Concern Note (ECN): Any faculty member may submit an Early Concern Note if they observe or learn of a minor professionalism lapse . ECNs are reported to the OIME and are reviewed by either the assistant dean of preclerkship or the assistant dean of clerkship curriculum . The relevant dean will discuss the issue with the student . If the professionalism lapse is significant or is considered to be a part of a pattern of behavior, it may be referred to COSEP for evaluation, as deemed appropriate by the relevant dean . Student Evaluations: Student professionalism is rou - tinely assessed via clerkship director evaluations, narra - tive evaluations and student performance evaluations . If there are reports of unprofessional behavior on any of these evaluations, these reports will be evaluated and addressed in the same manner as ECNs . RUSH University Student Complaint Portal: Any RUSH University student can report complaints through the RUSH University Student Complaint Portal . RUSH University will review or refer the complaints submit - ted through this portal to determine the appropriate follow-up . In addition to the above methods, faculty, staff and stu - dents are encouraged to report any concerns regarding professionalism to the relevant course/clerkship direc - tor or any OIME dean . Major lapses in professionalism should be immediately reported to any OIME dean .

College of Nursing Mission The mission of RUSH University College of Nursing is to integrate nursing practice, scholarship and education throughout the communities we serve and to boldly lead health care transformation to ensure health equity across the continuum of care . College of Nursing Vision Our vision is to lead nursing practice scholarship while driv - ing health equity . Philosophy The College of Nursing philosophy expresses the beliefs of the faculty regarding the metaparadigm of nursing and nursing education . Person The faculty believes that a person is a unique being who possesses innate dignity and worth with the right to self- determination . Persons live as individuals and as members of families, communities, and national and global societies .Envi ronment The environment includes the multiple systems in which per - sons interact . This environment includes personal, physical, family, community, societal, economic, cultural and politi - cal systems . Persons influence, and are influenced by, their environments . Health Health is a dynamic state of well-being that interacts with personal factors and the environment . It is perceived in the context of a multisystem environment . Nursing Nursing is both a discipline and a profession . The focus of the discipline is the generation of knowledge related to persons and their environments for the purpose of maximizing the well-being of individuals, families, communities and society through health promotion, restoration and maintenance . The focus of the profession is the care of individuals, groups and communities through application of discipline-specific and discipline-related knowledge . Nurses contribute both individ - ually and collaboratively with other professionals to promote positive health outcomes . Nurses apply a professional code of ethics and professional guidelines to clinical practice, and demonstrate compassion, advocacy and cultural sensitivity . Nursing Education The education of nurses is a process by which the knowledge, skills, values and culture of nursing are transmitted to the learner . The faculty believes that professional nursing educa - tion is accomplished in a university setting and in an environ - ment where nursing education, practice and research are integrated . Nursing education is built upon knowledge from the sciences, arts and humanities so students understand and value the human experience and its relationship to health . Nursing faculty members foster student growth by providing learning experiences in a variety of health care settings so students can understand the complexity of health care and learn the nursing role . The education of nurses is an interac - tive process whereby students are actively engaged learners who take responsibility for their education and practice . The curricula of the College of Nursing are designed to pro - duce nurses who are the following: Competent, caring practitioners; lifelong learners that value scholarship; and collaborative members of interpro - fessional teams and leaders in the profession Clinical scholars who contribute to the scientific basis of nursing practice, improve clinical outcomes through evidence-based practice, and positively influence the pro - fession and the health care system82 83 2023-2024 2023-2024 RUSH University Catalog RUSH University CatalogCollege of Nursing Diversity Statement The best future for nursing depends on our ability to prepare a broadly diverse student body to become nurse clinicians, researchers and leaders who will improve health care outcomes for all populations. The preparation of a diverse nursing workforce is paramount to the delivery of effective, culturally congruent and acces - sible health care in an increasingly diverse nation . A broadly diverse student body promotes an enriched environment and deeper learning for all students and a more capable health care workforce . Diversity is defined broadly and includes but is not limited to race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, disability, age, religion and veteran status . RUSH University College of Nursing uses a holistic admis - sions process where a student's experiences, attributes and academic performance all have merit in making an admissions decision . Each candidate brings a unique set of personal attributes, characteristics, culture and experiences, but all students can contribute to the creation of a diverse and inclusive learning environment . These important ele - ments are considered in combination with how the individual will contribute value as a health professions student and future nurse . The RUSH community strives to be an intentionally inclusive setting where students will thrive in learning, cocurricular and community experiences .

This requirement may be waived if the applicant has completed a minimum of three years of higher education and received their baccalaureate degree in the United States . Student Progression in the College of Nursing Student progress in the College of Nursing is reviewed and evaluated in several ways . The progressions policies estab - lished by the faculty are interpreted and applied by the student's academic adviser, the Office of the Dean and the College of Nursing Progressions Committee . The College of Nursing reserves the right to request a leave of absence or the withdrawal of any student whose conduct, physical or mental health or performance demonstrates lack of fitness for continuance in a health profession . Should a student's behavior come into question, policies and procedures to determine the student's continuing status in the college are delineated in the College of Nursing Student Guidebook . Since much of the work in nursing assumes that students will achieve a progressively higher level of understanding and skill, high academic performance is expected . The individual student is responsible for acquiring knowledge inside and outside of formal classroom and clinical settings . Academic Progressions Policy A student must achieve an A or B grade in all required clinical nursing courses . If a student receives a C grade in a single clinical didactic course or a single clinical practicum, the student must repeat the course prior to graduation . A student may repeat only one clinical didactic or clinical practicum in a program of study . An F or N grade in any required course places the student on academic probation and may result in dismissal from the program . A grade of F, N or a second C in a required clinical didactic or clinical practicum may result in dismissal from the program . Permission may be given to retake a course at the discretion of the Progressions Committee . If permitted, a student has only one opportunity to achieve a passing grade . An F or N grade in the repeated courses may result in dismissal . Students in all graduate programs must maintain a cumula - tive 3 .0 average in graduate coursework to remain in good academic standing . If a student's cumulative GPA drops below 3 .0, they will be placed on academic probation . A student may enroll for no more than two consecutive terms as a probationary student . Students may be dismissed from the College of Nursing upon failing to achieve satisfactory academic standing in the required period or if the student incurs a second probationary event . To be awarded a degree or certificate, a student must be in good academic standing at the completion of the program . Please refer to the College of Nursing Student Guidebook for a complete review of the college academic progression policy .

Some indi - viduals may acquire knowledge through experience and on the job training . When such persons apply for admission into the program, an attempt is made to grant academic credit for equivalent educational courses, equivalent knowledge acquired from experience and/or successful completion of the National Board for Respiratory Care's certification and registry examinations . All students graduating from the Respiratory Care program must meet the same standards for graduation; the award - ing of advanced standing does not signify a lesser quality education than that offered through regular course work . What it does, however, is attempt to exempt the student from those areas of the formal program where the student already has the knowledge and expertise in those skills that would be offered . The program has identified the minimum competencies that a respiratory therapist must have in order to provide safe, high-quality patient care . The identification of these competencies is a complex task, and a great deal of care must be taken to ensure a standard of excellence . The following policies and procedures are designed to ensure that those individuals who receive advanced stand - ing are qualified to do so, and that the screening process adheres to University and departmental policies at all times . It is not in the student's or program's best interest to allow individuals who are not qualified to receive advanced standing . To allow individuals who are not qualified, to receive advanced standing, is not in the student's or the program's best interest . Definition Advanced standing is defined as a special and individu - ally determined status granted to a student in a formal educational setting who has already gained professional experience through other sources or through non academic experiences, knowledge, skills and professionalism taught in the program courses . Purpose of Advanced-Standing Procedures The purpose of the advanced-standing procedures is to recognize and give formal educational credit for knowledge and/or ability gained through previous training or exp erience .Methods of Granting Advanced Standing 1 . Advanced standing can be awarded through transfer credit . 2 . Advanced standing can be awarded through the passing of an equivalency examination covering a certain area of knowledge . (An equivalency examination is an instrument or means by which a student accepted into the Respiratory Care program can demonstrate mastery of a knowledge area, content area or skill, and thus be exempted from a course in the program that teaches that area or skill .) 3 . Advanced standing can be awarded as credit for success - ful completion of national registry examinations (RRT/ RPFT) . Eligibility for Advanced Standing 1 . Transfer students who have been accepted into the RUSH University Respiratory Care program may receive a trans - fer credit for equivalent courses within the Respiratory Care program curriculum . 2 . Credentialed students (RRT, RPFT) who have been accepted into the RUSH University Respiratory Care Program may receive transfer credit and will also be eli - gible to take equivalency examinations in certain courses . Policy for Transfer Students Students who have completed coursework at other approved respiratory care programs may petition to have these courses transfer in lieu of specific coursework in the RUSH University program . Students must submit a transcript of their courses from the program and a copy of the course syllabus for each course in which they desire transfer credit . The syllabus must contain the following: course objectives, lecture outlines, course content, evaluation procedures and related informa - tion . These courses will be evaluated on an individual basis for content and total contact hours and credit hours . The department reserves the right to test the proficiency of any student in coursework transferred from other respiratory care programs and the right to disallow such transfer credit in such coursework in cases which the student cannot demon - strate acceptable proficiency . All transfer credit is subject to the approval of the Committee on Progress and Promotions for Respiratory Care . The student must also have a minimum grade of B (3 .0) for each course being transferred . A student cannot receive transfer credit for any respiratory care course - work if he or she left the previous program due to academic probation, suspension or exclusion . All University policies regarding transfer credit must be satisfied .190 191 2023-2024 2023-2024 RUSH University Catalog RUSH University CatalogPolicy for Individuals Who Hold the RRT Credential Advanced standing is available to individuals who have successfully completed the National Board for Respiratory Care's Respiratory Therapy Registry (RRT), who hold a bac - calaureate degree from a regionally accredited college or university .

Toward that goal, we teach the highest levels of competence and integrity in education, leadership and research, and provide professional development and research mentoring by estab - lished scholars across the continuum of health sciences .The underlying educational philosophy of the program is grounded in a triad of learner-centered thought: progressiv - ism in which the learners' experiences, needs and interests are explored and fostered; reconstructionism in which the learners see their growth applied to real-world problems; and existentialism by which learners are challenged to own their future and become leaders in the evolution of health care . Mission Our mission is to produce experienced health science professionals with a broad-based, interdisciplinary educa - tion who are prepared to lead, teach, practice clinically and perform research at the highest levels of competency and integrity .Health SciencesVision To become the highest quality PhD in health sciences pro - gram in the United States . Curricular Design We offer a rigorous curriculum that emphasizes funda - mentals and advanced concepts in leadership, education, research and professional development . We provide high quality, asynchronous online courses in leadership, educa - tion and research . The role of the curricular design is to provide a logical progression to learner growth . The guiding principal of the curricular design is three-fold and presented in a continuum of foundations (theory), appli - cation (real-world problem resolution) and vision (synthesis and creative/critical forward thinking regarding the future trajectory of health care) . The curricular design first estab - lishes a foundation of past and current thinking (epistemo - logical framework) and theory associated with leadership, education and research . The curriculum challenges learners to address real-world applications through focused semi - nar courses and learner-centered projects . The curriculum progresses and challenges the learners' axiological consider - ations, encouraging the value of moving health care forward through research, demonstration projects, dissertation focus, ownership of learning and philosophical challenges to the status quo . The program director provides general academic sup - port and oversees the professional development courses . Transition to doctoral candidate occurs upon successfully completing most core courses, passing a comprehensive qualifying exam and passing a dissertation proposal pre - sented to the dissertation committee . Doctoral candidates conduct research and publish under the guidance and supervision of a research mentor . The dissertation committee consists of the research mentor, the program director and at least three additional qualified members . The dissertation committee ensures students are well-prepared to identify and fill important gaps in knowl - edge through the generation and dissemination of new knowledge, and endorses the awarding of the PhD degree . Program Overview The Doctor of Philosophy in Health Sciences program was launched by the College of Health Sciences in fall 2011 . The program is designed to prepare health science profession - als to assume major leadership, research and educational positions within their professions, as well as to foster career advancement opportunities .The program provides a broad-based, interdisciplinary education that prepares graduates to teach, practice and perform research across the continuum of health care . The program prepares individuals for careers in research, educa - tion and leadership within allied health and, more broadly, within health care and higher education . The program of study for the Doctor of Philosophy degree involves formal courses in leadership, education and research . It also involves mentored professional develop - ment within a health science specialty field . The publication of scholarly work in a peer-reviewed journal and the passing of a comprehensive oral examination are also required . In addition, students must complete and present a dissertation proposal that meets the approval of their advisory com - mittee prior to beginning a dissertation research project that culminates in the writing and oral public defense of a dissertation . The PhD degree demonstrates the capability for indepen - dent research and recognizes a unique contribution to scientific knowledge . The program may be taken on a part- time basis, however, in all cases must be completed in seven years or less . The program consists of five major core areas: leadership (12 credits), education (nine credits), research (18 credits), professional development (three credits) and dissertation research (12 credits minimum) . The professional develop - ment courses are based on learning contracts that provide opportunities for advanced mentored learning and skill development in the allied health profession matching the students' interests . Student learning objectives have been developed for each major core area and are mapped to individual courses . Students entering the program must have a master's degree in an area related to health sciences/health care adminis - tration or substantial professional experiences in a health sciences related field . Program Objectives 1 . Produce scholars who will generate new knowledge and innovative applications through research 2 .

Occupational Therapy: Program Overview Professional Description The Department of Occupational Therapy offers a graduate program that prepares students for unique contributions to the field of occupational therapy . This professional-level program is designed for people with baccalaureate degrees in other fields who are seeking to become occupational therapists . Philosophy on Education Occupational therapists recognize humans as complex beings engaged in and organized around occupations occur - ring within the social, physical, temporal, cultural, personal and virtual environments (AOTA, 2014; AOTA 2017) . When dysfunction or internal or external contexts limit or prevent participation, occupational therapists enable doing in a vari - ety of ways . The practice of occupational therapy involves individuals, groups or organizations, their attributes and the multiple environmental contexts that comprise occupa - tional performance . Occupational therapy interventions are designed to facilitate people to adapt and change in order to improve their engagement in occupational performance across the lifespan . RUSH University Department of Occupational Therapy faculty members fulfill roles as practitioner-teacher and investigator, a combination that infuses the curriculum with contemporary and scholarly perspectives to prepare stu - dents to meet the occupational needs of society . Graduate courses and clinical experiences build on students' past knowledge and skills to encourage transformative and inte - grative learning . The critical self-reflection of the transfor - mative learning process encourages examining, questioning, validating and possibly revising prior knowledge so that new perceptions and meanings may evolve (Cranton, 2006) . Integrative learning expands on this process by facilitating Occupational Therapy240 241 2023-2024 2023-2024 RUSH University Catalog RUSH University Catalogstudents' ability to connect ideas, concepts and experi - ences to better adapt to novel and complex issues (Huber & Hutchings, 2004) . The end result is a learner who is intel - lectually flexible to meet the needs of complex clients in a continually changing society . A program based on transfor - mative and integrative learning builds on a student's past, connects it to present activities and predicts a future in which they are competent and capable to respond to the ongoing needs of the profession and the clients we serve . The curriculum builds towards leadership in professional reasoning and meeting the needs of an increasingly dynamic profession . Self-directed learning and critical thinking using evidence-based research and practice are fostered through faculty mentorship, problem solving, collaborative activities and critical inquiry in the classroom, clinic and community to promote entry-level performance . The individualized doctoral experience establishes a trajectory that enables students to become an emerging leader in their professional practice . RUSH occupational therapy graduates are pre - pared to work in traditional and emerging practice settings but, more importantly, are ethical, flexible, creative, autono - mous and informed practitioner-teacher-investigators . Professional Orientation Since the RUSH graduate will be prepared to work in a vari - ety of traditional and nontraditional settings, their practice base is the result of broad experiences within the many arenas of occupational therapy . Graduates have the ability to add increasing amounts of depth and validation to their intervention programs as a result of their involvement and experiences with problem-solving approaches to therapy . Given the combination of breadth and depth of knowledge and experience related to occupational therapy intervention, the primary strength of RUSH University graduates will be their ability to function as highly resourceful practitioners . As in the past, and for the foreseeable future, the role of the practitioner is the core of all occupational therapy . The prac - titioner who is able to base intervention on established fact, use internal and external resources and engage in profes - sional reasoning and problem-solving is the practitioner who will contribute to the credibility and viability of the profes - sion . It is this type of practitioner who is expected to be the product of the RUSH program . Graduates of the program are able to enter the clinical arena competently and confidently, applying their clinical skills and expanding upon those skills as situations require . This con - tinuous process of assessment and expansion contributes to the personal and professional growth vital to occupational therapists . The role of the clinician, as it is understood in this context, incorporates other major roles of the therapist . As the RUSH program is designed, the students have the opportunity to explore the functions of the therapist as an educator, researcher and manager from the practitioner's perspective . The involvement of the student in these other roles is another major strength of the program . The addi - tional roles of educator, manager and researcher cannot be separated from the practitioner's role . Accreditation and Certification The RUSH University Occupational Therapy Doctorate program is fully accredited by the Accreditation Council for Occupational Therapy Education (ACOTE) of the American Occupational Therapy Association (AOTA), located at: 6116 Executive Boulevard, Suite 200 North Bethesda, MD 20852-4929 Phone: (301) 652-AOTA www .acoteonline . org Graduates will be eligible to sit for the national certification examination for the occupational therapist that is adminis - tered by the National Board for Certification in Occupational Therapy or NBCOT .

The Doctor of Philosophy is awarded in recognition of high achievement in a particular field of scientific research as evidenced by submission of a dissertation that demonstrates independent investigation and contributes new information to the body of existing knowledge . The PhD program is integrated and research-ori - ented; it should culminate in a work of literary and scholarly merit, which is indicative of the candidate's ability to con - duct original research in a recognized specialty . Specifically, the program is composed of formal courses, guided indi - vidual study in a chosen field or discipline, cognate subjects recommended by the candidate's advisory committee, original research that serves as the basis of scientific publi - cation and a scholarly dissertation . A first-authored scien - tific manuscript of the student's original research is a degree requirement . Admission to Candidacy Admission to candidacy is evidence that the doctoral student has successfully completed all preliminary course - work and is prepared to move into the intensive research experience . Depending upon the requirements of the program, these exams will test accumulated knowledge, scientific reasoning and the ability to critically and analyti - cally thinking . Admission to candidacy is a demonstration of confidence that the student will successfully accomplish the remaining requirements of the program . Students failing to achieve admission to candidacy may apply the coursework and completed research toward a related Master of Science degree upon recommendation by the dissertation advisory committee . Dissertation A doctoral student must complete a dissertation . This docu - ment is developed through faculty-guided independent research projects . The dissertation must be original and cannot have been used to meet the requirement of any other degree, either at RUSH University or any other university . Each student will have a dissertation or advisory committee whose role is to assure that the student's dissertation is of high quality and meets the standards of the program and the Graduate College for originality, contribution to the field and 272 273 2023-2024 2023-2024 RUSH University Catalog RUSH University Catalogscholarly presentation . The committee is also to assure that the student is making satisfactory progress toward comple - tion of the degree . The committee is chosen by the student in conjunction with the student's primary adviser and should consist of at least five total members . The composition of this committee should be approved by the Academic Standards Committee and should comply with any specific requirements of the Graduate College . Advisory committee members must be members of the Graduate College . At least one member of the committee should be external to RUSH University . Once the committee convenes, it will choose a chairperson who cannot be the student's primary adviser . In addition to the five committee members, the program director will serve as an ex officio member of the committee . Master of Science The Master of Science degree is designed to enhance the scientific and professional preparation of students aspiring for a career in the health professions or in a related field requiring graduate level biomedical sciences . Students will bolster their preparation for further study or entry into the biomedical workforce by completing a rigorous combination of multidisciplinary graduate level coursework, immersive experiential learning, individualized electives, advising and professional development . The College offers two types of Master of Science degrees: thesis and non-thesis . The Integrated Biomedical Sciences and Clinical Research Master of Science programs are the - sis-requiring and traditionally take five terms to complete . The Biotechnology Master of Science degree is a two-term, non-thesis accelerated program designed to provide labora - tory and research skills at the graduate level . Thesis The thesis is a record of the research experience of the stu - dent and must be original work with the potential to be pub - lished in a peer-reviewed journal . The student will identify an area of interest and submit the name of a potential adviser to the Academic Standards Committee for approval . After the student selects a research adviser and begins to collect preliminary data, the student and adviser will select an advisory committee . This committee will advise the student and evaluate their proposal and thesis documents . The committee will consist of the adviser and two additional Graduate College faculty members . Committee members should be familiar with either the research area or crucial technical aspects of the student's project . Committee members are intended to be a resource for the student and their adviser to enhance didactic and technical knowledge towards the completion of the student's project . Public Defense Students in the PhD Program and the thesis masters are expected to present their work via a public defense . The defense is a one-hour live, oral (not pre-recorded) presenta - tion by the students on the main aspects of the research and will be attended by the advisory committee and faculty and students of the University . Upon completion of the presenta - tion, the advisory committee then meets in closed session to examine the candidate and approve the thesis/disserta - tion . In the case of a PhD student, the committee strives for a consensus, but the dissertation can be approved over the objections of a single committee member . All voting mem - bers of the masters advisory committee must approve the thesis document and certify that the student has completed all requirements for the Master of Science degree .

This broad based approach to disease is the core of the Integrated Biomedical Sciences program . Year 2 Research Experience, Qualifying Examination The selection of research adviser will significantly influ - ence the student's selection of a research area of inter - est . The goals of the second year are to learn the relevant laboratory techniques and to develop a research proposal in conjunction with their research adviser . The research project will advance knowledge in a specific discipline and yield first-author scientific publications for the student . The student's research proposal should include specific aims and be written in the format of a NIH F31 grant proposal (See researchtraining .nih . gov/programs/fellowships/F31) . The student must select a dissertation committee and defend the proposal in front of the committee by the end of the second year . The written proposal and its defense in front of the committee constitutes the qualifying exami - nation . Passing the qualifying examination in front of the dissertation committee means the student is a candidate for the PhD . The student's assessment at this time relates to the follow - ing Student Learning Outcomes: The graduate will be able to acquire research skills, collect and analyze data and interpret results in order to address an original research question . In addition, this step begins the continuing assessment of the following outcomes: A graduating student will be capable of independent critical thinking and writing as well as pro - posing, performing and effectively presenting their research . The student will be able to work collaboratively with other scientists, physicians and health care professionals to give and obtain feedback concerning the approach to research problems, data analysis and implications of research . The work environment in basic and clinical science is evolv - ing . Students should be aware of the many different types of opportunities available in the workplace and need to prepare themselves for the opportunities and challenges that they will encounter when they graduate . In addition to the research and the coursework, the student will create an individual development plan (IDP) each year to define their areas of interest, skills and values . Students will review their IDP yearly with their research mentor, program director or Graduate College designee to refine their career interests and define their gaps in knowl - edge or skills that can be pursued in the following year . By the time of graduation, students should have used the IDP, along with mentorship and experiential or other training opportunities to refine their career path . Student progress is assessed at the end of years two through five . At the end of year two, student progress toward meeting expected outcomes will be evaluated by the student's research adviser and program director . See section on Dissertation Proposal and Presentation . Qualifying Examination The goals of the second year are to learn the relevant laboratory techniques and to develop a research proposal in conjunction with the student's research adviser . The research project will advance scientific knowledge in a spe - cific discipline and yield first-author scientific publications . For the Qualifying Examination, the student's research pro - posal should include a hypothesis and specific aims and be written in the format of an NIH F31 grant (researchtraining . nih .gov/programs/fellowships/F31) . The student must select a dissertation committee and defend the written proposal as an oral defense in front of the committee by the end of the second year . All members of the committee or appropriate substitutes must be present at the Qualifying Examination either in person, on the phone or using electronic media . If the student does not complete the Qualifying Examination by the end of the summer of their second year, they will be reported to the Academic Standards Committee and placed on probation during the fall of their third year . If the student has not taken the examination by the end of the term of probation the student will be again reported to the Academic Standards Committee for potential dismissal . Since the adviser shares in the responsibility to ensure student academic progress, including completion of program milestones in a timely manner, advisers of students who do not take the qualifying examination by the end of fall term of their third year will not be allowed to take a new student into their laboratory for the subsequent two years . Following the defense of their Qualifying Examination, students will submit their written proposal as an Individual National Research Service Award (F31) [researchtraining .nih .284 285 2023-2024 2023-2024 RUSH University Catalog RUSH University Cataloggov/programs/fellowships/F31] or a comparable grant appli - cation . While a student is conducting dissertation research the student will present their progress every six months to their committee in an identical format as the original proposal meeting until the committee has agreed that the student can write their dissertation . The advisory committee meetings will consist of an oral pre - sentation of research progress by the doctoral student to the committee . This oral presentation will be followed by a dis - cussion of progress and career development . A detailed writ - ten account of progress will be distributed by the student to their committee prior to this meeting . It is recommended that the RUSH career development IDP (rushedu-auvic .formstack . com/forms/idp) Year 3-5 Research Progress/Publications/ Dissertation For evaluation in years three through five, the student will submit a written report documenting their progress . The research adviser and program director will also submit their assessment of student progress for each year . A meeting with the student, research adviser and program director will take place at the end of each year to discuss the student's progress . The research adviser monitors the day-to-day progress of the student . The dissertation committee will meet at least every six months to monitor progress and to approve any changes to the proposed research project . They may meet more frequently, especially after the approval of the stu - dent's research proposal . The student is expected to attend national meetings, make presentations, posters etc . and become a part of the scientific community . Likewise, the stu - dent should be submitting research articles . The Integrated Biomedical Science PhD program requires that the research project yield at least one first-authored research article accepted for publication in a scientific peer-reviewed journal . The publication requirement is necessary for graduation but not sufficient . The dissertation committee will continue to assess student progress on the aims and determines when the student has completed their dissertation . (See Dissertation Proposal and Presentation below) . The student's assessment continues on the outcomes listed above with emphasis on the growth of research and com - munication skills . Likewise, it is expected that the communi - cation outcomes will also become more centered on written communication in the form of abstracts, peer-reviewed journal articles and the dissertation as the student begins to complete the following outcome: The graduate is able to contribute to the scientific literature in an area of expertise via published abstracts, a dissertation and by the publication of a first-authored research article in a scientific refereed journal . Dissertation Document, Presentation and Approval The student is expected to write a dissertation (format approved by the Center for Academic Excellence) and pres - ent the work in a public forum attended by the dissertation committee (all members are required to be in attendance), and University faculty and students . The dissertation defense shall be a live oral presentation (not pre-recorded) by the student on the main aspects of the research reported in the dissertation, followed by questions, comments and discussion . The chair of the dissertation committee shall act as the moderator of the discussion . The dissertation com - mittee will then meet with the student in a closed session to address any additional questions and to deliberate on approval of the dissertation . Typically, the meeting immedi - ately follows the public defense . The student may be asked to make revisions before final approval of the dissertation by the committee . The student must notify the Registrar's Office of impending completion of the degree by the submission of an Intent to Graduate Form at the beginning of the final term . Prior to completion, the student should consult with the Center for Academic Excellence to ensure that the dissertation is formatted correctly . Qualifying Examination Dissertation Proposal and Presentation \u2014 For the Qualifying Examination, the student will write a research proposal in the style of the NIH F31 fellowship, including a hypoth - esis, specific aims, and a detailed research strategy (see researchtraining .nih . gov/programs/fellowships/F31) . The stu - dent must select a dissertation committee and present the proposal to the committee by the end of the second year . Experiential Learning Opportunities (ELOs) Experiential Learning Opportunities (ELOs) are part of the foundation upon which students develop knowledge and skills from direct or hands-on experiences outside of their own laboratory and didactic training . An ELO encompasses a vast array of activities, including, but not limited to, intern - ships, service learning, workshops, specialized courses, and other creative career and professional experiences that promote interdisciplinary learning and career preparedness . ELOs provide students with the opportunity to understand and explore potential career paths with minimal risk . ELOs provide experiences that can be referenced (e . g ., on resumes, curriculum vitas, etc .) and are valued in a high-stakes, com - petitive market . ELOs provide students a practical way to apply and lever - age their skills and knowledge and solve problems outside of their major research project . ELOs provide students with the opportunity to collaborate with non-specialists and poten - tially to engage intellectually and socially in an area outside of the biomedical sciences . Once a student has successfully completed their candidacy exam, an ELO is an annual requirement until completion of the program . Program requirements can be found www . rushu .rush . edu/graduate-college/career-development-office/ experiential-learning . Minimal Credit Hours Required for the Integrated Biomedical Sciences (PhD) Degree The PhD in Integrated Biomedical Sciences should be com - pleted in five years and requires completion of 80 credits dis - tributed as follows: core courses (22), research area specific courses (four) and dissertation research (54) . Students must also pass the Qualifying Examination, submit an Individual National Research Service Award (F31) or comparable grant application, complete an annual Experiential Learning Opportunity (ELO), and publish a first-authored, scientific, peer-reviewed manuscript on their research project . The core curriculum, which is common to all students, builds knowledge and skills in research theories and methodology, data analysis and statistics, laboratory applications and skills, and the molecular and cellular sciences basic to health and disease . These courses provide systematic exposure to the contemporary process of scientific discovery and will serve as the basis for the remainder of the curriculum . Advanced students entering with a Master of Science (MS) degree in a biomedical science or a Doctor of Medicine (MD or DO) degree may have satisfied the requirement for some of the core classes based on their prior records . Therefore, some core course requirements may be waived . The requirement of core course hours can be compensated by taking extra hours of laboratory rotations or dissertation research . These students may be able to complete the degree in a shorter time period providing that they progress through the other program requirements . IBS MS students who enter the IBS PhD program will be on a separate plan of study, which requires fewer cognate and elective credits based on the number required for the IBS MS program . All students will be required to complete a minimum of 54 credits of Dissertation Research following admission into candidacy for the PhD . Dissertation credits in the Graduate College typically involve laboratory-based research required for completion of the dissertation and include training in various types of skills, including: analyzing published data; developing a research proposal; learning and apply - ing advanced methodologies and statistical data analyses; developing skills to write and submit a pre-doctoral training grant application; practicing presentation skills to dissemi - nate one's own research findings in national conferences; writing a research publication; and developing and defend - ing a dissertation project . Integrated Biomedical Sciences (PhD): Academic Policies Research Adviser Selection During the first year the student will select up to three laboratories for research rotations . These laboratory rotations will expose the students to a range of research environments . Rotations should be undertaken with mentors who hold a faculty appointment in the Graduate College . Students are expected have a project with a hypothesis and aims, to learn techniques and attend all lab meetings . Based on these rotations, the student will identify their labora - tory of interest and submit the name of the adviser to the Academic Standards Committee . The committee, in consul - tation with the potential adviser(s) will approve the adviser- student matches . Students who are already committed to a particular laboratory (funded by the research adviser's grants) are required to perform a minimum of two laboratory rotations . Exposure to other laboratories and research will give the student a greater breadth of knowledge . Students are expected to select a research adviser and an area of research interest by the end of their first summer term . All advisers must meet the criterion established by the Graduate College . Integrated Biomedical Sciences (PhD): Research Opportunities The research areas of interest for the Integrated Biomedical Sciences PhD program are translational cancer research; 286 287 2023-2024 2023-2024 RUSH University Catalog RUSH University Catalogcardiovascular and respiratory biology; immunity, inflam - mation and infection; functions and disorders of the mus - culoskeletal system; and functions and disorders of the nervous system . These include qualified faculty from RUSH University Medical Center who have an interest in research in these areas . They come from academic departments as well as clinical departments, which enables students to select a variety of individuals with basic and clinical exper - tise to serve on their advisory committees and guide them through their projects . Advisory Committee By the end of the summer term of the first year the student should have selected a research adviser and begun to col - lect preliminary data . The research adviser is required to hold a faculty appointment in the Graduate College . Once a research adviser has been selected, a dissertation commit - tee must be selected by the end of the following term . This committee advises the student and serves as the Qualifying Examination committee and the dissertation committee . The Graduate College requires that the committee is comprised of five members . One member will be the student's research adviser . A majority of the committee (at least three mem - bers) must be faculty at RUSH University who are members of the Graduate College . The chair of this committee, who cannot be the student's research adviser, will be chosen at the first committee meeting and will preside at all subse - quent meetings and arrange for a timely completion of the dissertation work . The dissertation committee strives for consensus in all its actions . A majority vote of the commit - tee's membership, however, is sufficient for all activities except the final approval of the dissertation . In addition to the five committee members, the program director will serve as an ex officio member of the committee . The ex officio member can participate in the meetings but cannot vote . The purpose of having an ex officio member is to monitor the quality of the examination experience . The ex officio member will ensure that the Graduate College rules are followed . The first committee meeting should take place within six months of its selection and approval . Data Defense and Dissertation In the candidate's final year, a dissertation data defense will be presented to their dissertation committee demonstrating that satisfactory progress has been made on the project to justify development of a plan to complete all experiments and to start writing their dissertation . If determined, the dissertation committee will submit the request to Defend form . The data defense should be considered the final com - mittee meeting . Upon completion of the data defense and writing of the dis - sertation, the student will provide the dissertation to their committee at least two weeks prior to their public defense . The public defense will be comprised of a public one-hour lecture attended by the dissertation committee and faculty and students of the University . The dissertation committee then meets in closed session to examine the candidate and approve the dissertation . Typically, the meeting immediately follows the public lecture . The committee strives for a consensus, but the dissertation can be approved over the objections of a single committee member . However, if two or more committee members disap - prove of either the written dissertation or its oral defense, then the dissertation is not approved . The awarding of the PhD degree requires the demonstration of a capability for independent research and a contribution to scientific knowl - edge . Similar to the qualifying examination, all members of the committee or appropriate substitutes must be present at the dissertation defense either in person, on the phone or using electronic media . Since a scientific peer-reviewed first-authored research article is required for the degree, the dissertation is not considered complete until the publication of at least one peer-reviewed first authored publication . If publication is pending, the Committee may approve the dissertation, but the Graduate College will not sign the Degree Approval form until the paper is accepted or published as verified by appearance in the U .S . National Library of Medicine . Integrated Biomedical Sciences (PhD): Tuition Scholarship and Stipend Acceptance into the doctoral program is limited by the availability of stipends . Accepted doctoral students receive a competitive University supported stipend and tuition scholarship, are supported by a faculty member or have sti - pends from external sources . University funded stipends are awarded to U .S . residents . The stipend and tuition scholar - ship are renewed each year providing the student is making satisfactory progress towards the degree . Outside employ - ment is not acceptable without prior Graduate College approval as it interferes with the time and effort necessary First Year Credit Hours Fall Term GCC-516 Foundations in Biomedical Sciences 7 GCC-530 Laboratory Rotations I 1-9 GCC-546 Principles of Biostatistics I 2 GCC-548 Bioinformatics 1 Spring Term BTN-525 Experimental Design and Models in Disease 2 GCC-506 Biomedical Ethics 1 GCC-599 Thesis Research for Integrated Biomedical Sciences 1-9 Summer Term GCC-599 Thesis Research for Integrated Biomedical Sciences 1-9 Second Year Credit Hours Fall and Spring Terms GCC-599 Thesis Research for Integrated Biomedical Sciences 1-9Integrated Biomedical Sciences: MS Curriculum Notes: Students should register for two credits of Laboratory Rotation I .
