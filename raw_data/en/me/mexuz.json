(704) 315-5756 Meditation is a practice which helps to alleviate anxiety, foster self- awareness, improve insight and concentration, and restore a sense of balance and inner peace. Meditation is used to restore the link between the thoughts and the awareness of what is happening in the body as a result of the thoughts. This helps to disassociate from the repetitive and often negative habitual patterns of thinking that may cause disease. Meditation brings the mind back to the richness of the present moment which helps to develop a sense of compassion as the person learns to observe the world through the lens of clarity and begins to see without the cultural and social filters that influence our thinking.
