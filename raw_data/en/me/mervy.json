The [mega-corrections](http://www.retractionwatch.com/category/mega-corrections/) \u2014 part of what we are close to being ready to call a trend in errata notices \u2014 in the Journal of Clinical Oncology (JCO) are, however, quite impressive, each with at least a dozen points. [One of the corrections](http://jco.ascopubs.org/content/30/5/572.1.full), for a paper cited 15 times, according to Thomson Scientific's Web of Knowledge, basically removes all references to chemotherapy sensitivity: The September 1, 2009 article by Anguiano et al, entitled, \"Gene Expression Profiles of Tumor Biology Provide a Novel Approach to Prognosis and May Guide the Selection of Therapeutic Targets in Multiple Myeloma\" (J Clin Oncol 27: [4197-4203], 2009), contained material that requires correction, in light of the retraction of an article by Potti et al (Nat Med 12:1294-1300, 2006) that was referenced in this article. 1) The corresponding author was given as Anil Potti, MD. It should now be: Sascha A. Tuchman, MD, Division of Medical Oncology, Duke University Medical Center, Morris Building 25155, Box 3872, Durham, NC 27710; e-mail: [sascha.tuchman@duke.edu]. 2) In the Abstract, the last sentence of the Purpose section was given as: \"We performed gene expression profiling (GEP) with microarray data to better dissect the molecular phenotypes, sensitivity to particular chemotherapeutic agents, and prognoses of these diseases.\" It should now be: \"We performed gene expression profiling (GEP) with microarray data to better dissect the molecular phenotypes and prognoses of these diseases.\" 3) In the Abstract, the last sentence of the Methods section should be omitted. 4) In the Abstract, the last sentence of the Results section was given as: \"These clusters differentiated themselves based on predictions for prognosis and chemotherapy sensitivity (eg, in ISS stage I, one cluster was characterized by increased CIN, cyclophosphamide resistance, and a poor prognosis).\" It should now be: \"These clusters differentiated themselves based on predictions for prognosis (eg, in ISS stage I, one cluster was characterized by increased CIN and a poor prognosis).\" 5) In the Methods section, under Development of Signatures, the last paragraph should be omitted. 6) In the Methods section, the heading of the last subsection was given as: \"Application of Oncogenic of Oncogenic Pathway- and Tumor Biology-Signatures.\" 7) In Results section, the last subsection, entitled \"Conventional Cytotoxic Chemotherapeutic Sensitivity Patterns in ISS Risk Cohorts,\" should be omitted. 8) In the Discussion section, the last two sentences of the fourth paragraph should be omitted. 9) In the Discussion section, the third through last sentences of the second-to-last paragraph should be omitted. 10) In the Discussion section, the first sentence of the last paragraph was given as: \"We view the work described here as a platform for the future development of highly refined genomic prognostic models and chemotherapy-sensitivity predictors for all agents that have activity in treating MM, not only conventional, cytotoxic agents.\" It should now be: \"We view the work described here as a platform for the future development of highly refined genomic prognostic models.\" 11) In the References section, references 46 and 48-55 should be omitted. 12) In the Appendix, Figure A2 and Figure A5 should be omitted. The online version has been corrected in departure from the print. JCO has obtained written assurance from the corresponding author that there are no concerns with respect to the remaining data and conclusions stated in this article. JCO shared the decision to publish this Author Correction Note with institutional representatives at Duke University, who are in agreement with the decision. The authors apologize for the errors. The [other](http://jco.ascopubs.org/content/30/5/572.2.full), for study cited nine times, goes as far as to change the title of the paper: The November 20, 2009 article by Rao et al, entitled, \"Age-Specific Differences in Oncogenic Pathway Dysregulation and Anthracycline Sensitivity Leukemia\" (J Clin Oncol 27: [5580-5586], 2009), contained material that requires correction, in light of the retraction of an article by Potti et al (Nat Med 12:1294-1300, 2006) that was referenced in this article. 1) The title should now read \"Age-Specific Differences in Oncogenic Pathway Dysregulation in Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia.\" 2) In the Abstract, Patients and Methods section, the last sentence was given as: \"Gene expression analysis was conducted utilizing gene set enrichment analysis, and by applying previously defined and tested signature profiles reflecting dysregulation of oncogenic signaling pathways, altered tumor environment, and signatures of chemotherapy sensitivity.\" Whereas it should now be: \"Gene expression analysis was conducted utilizing gene set enrichment analysis, and by applying previously defined and tested signature profiles reflecting dysregulation of oncogenic signaling pathways and altered tumor environment.\" 3) In the Abstract, Results section, the third sentence should be omitted. 4) Also, in the Results section of the Abstract, the last two sentences were given as: \"Hierarchical clustering revealed that younger AML patients in cluster 2 had clinically worse survival, with high RAS, Src, and TNF pathway activation and in turn were less sensitive to anthracycline compared with patients in cluster 1. However, among elderly patients with AML, those in cluster 1 also demonstrated high RAS, Src, and TNF pathway activation but this did not translate into differences in survival or anthracycline sensitivity.\" Whereas they should now be: \"Hierarchical clustering revealed that younger patients with AML in cluster 2 had clinically worse survival, with high RAS, Src, and TNF pathway activation compared with patients in cluster 1. However, among elderly patients with AML, those in cluster 1 also demonstrated high RAS, Src, and TNF pathway activation but this did not translate into differences in survival.\" 5) In the Abstract, Conclusion section, the first sentence was given as: \"AML in the elderly represents a distinct biologic entity characterized by unique patterns of deregulated signaling pathway variations that contributes to poor survival and anthracycline resistance.\" Whereas it should now be: \"AML in the elderly represents a distinct biologic entity characterized by unique patterns of deregulated signaling pathway variations that contributes to poor survival.\" 6) In the Patients and Methods section, the heading of the third subsection was given as \"Oncogenic Pathway and Chemotherapy Sensitivity Analyses,\" whereas it should now read \"Oncogenic Pathway Analyses.\" 7) Also, in the same subsection, the first sentence of the first paragraph was given as: \"Previously described signatures tumor healing [WH] as a measure signature [EPI], Software, version 7.0.4 CA).9-12\" Whereas it tumor healing [WH] as a measure of angiogenesis, epigenetic stem-cell signature [EPI], and TNF) were applied MatLab Software, version 7.0.4 (MathWorks, EI Segundo, CA).9-12\" 8) Also, in the same subsection, the second sentence of the first paragraph and the entire last paragraph should both be omitted. 9) In the Results section, the subsection \"Chemotherapy Sensitivity Patterns in AML\" should be omitted. 10) In the Discussion section, the fourth sentence of the second paragraph was given as: \"Elderly patients with AML have an increased probability of RAS, Src, and TNF pathway activation when compared with their younger counterparts, and this may in part explain decreased sensitivity to anthracycline.\" Whereas it should now be: \"Elderly patients with AML have an increased probability of RAS, Src, and TNF pathway activation when compared with their younger counterparts.\" 11) In the Discussion section, the last sentence of the third paragraph should be omitted. 12) In the Discussion section, the last paragraph was given as: \"Finally, although host-related factors and performance status also play an important role in the prognosis of AML, we hope that this study has been able to dissect the biology of AML as a function of age with regard to the underlying molecular events and insensitivity to anthracyclines.\" Whereas it should now be: \"Finally, although host-related factors and performance status also play an important role in the prognosis of AML, we hope that this study has been able to dissect the biology of AML as a function of age with regard to the underlying molecular events.\" 13) In the References section, references 12 and 13 should be omitted. 14) In the Appendix, Figure A4 should be omitted. The online version has been corrected in departure from the print. JCO has obtained written assurance from the corresponding author that there are no concerns with respect to the remaining data and conclusions stated in this article. JCO shared the decision to publish this Author Correction Note with institutional representatives at Duke University, who are in agreement with the decision. The authors apologize for the errors. We're all for complete transparency, and the revised papers are clearly quite clear about what's been changed, but are we the only ones wondering about the threshold for retracting this work? Potti has had nine retractions, [the most recent of which was also in the JCO](http://www.retractionwatch.com/2012/02/06/anil-potti-and-colleagues-retract-ninth-paper-this-one-in-jco/).
