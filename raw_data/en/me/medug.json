Real Simple's Editorial Guidelines Updated on July 20, 2023 In This Article View All In This Article What is sol\u00e9 water? What's the history of sol\u00e9 water? Does salt water improve hydration? Are there benefits to sol\u00e9 water? Is sol\u00e9 water dangerous? The Bottom Line Hydration is key to a healthy, balanced body all year long, and particularly in warmer temperatures. It's also a vital component of maintaining performance during strenuous workouts. The truth is that every single person will have different, individual hydration needs, but generally speaking, women need 2.7 liters of water daily, and men need 3.7 liters, according to the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. This minimum might be too low for you, and your body may need a bit more if you're super-active or the weather outside. Getty Images Plain water is usually the number-one best way to hydrate\u2014in addition to the other hydrating foods and drinks you're consuming throughout the day (coffee, milk, tea, veggies, and fruits are all hydrating and count toward daily goals!). A recent hydration health fad, however, suggests that adding salt to your water could boost its hydrating benefits\u2014but is there any truth to it? Also known as sol\u00e9 water\u2014water with added pink Himalayan salt\u2014this hydration trend is blowing up the wellness world. We asked experts and consulted the research to investigate the benefits and drawbacks of drinking salt water. And here's what they had to say about it. How Much Water Should You Drink Every Day? Plus Signs You're Hydrated What is sol\u00e9 water? Sol\u00e9 water is a concentrated solution of natural salts, specifically pink Himalayan Sea Salt and purified water, mixed to the point where the water is fully saturated with salt over 24 hours in your fridge, explains Benjamin Brown, clinical nutrition and exercise physiology expert, and CEO and head coach at BSL Nutrition. You are not supposed to drink this solution straight up\u2014instead, the idea is to add a small amount of the solution (think: one teaspoon) to your daily water intake to reap a myriad of proposed health benefits, he explains. What's the history of sol\u00e9 water? Your TikTok or Instagram feeds might be full of wellness influencers gushing about this \"new\" way to hydrate\u2014but the practice of mixing salt into water has a very long history, dating back hundreds of years. Sol\u00e9 water has its roots in ancient Ayurvedic and traditional Chinese medicine practices, according to Josie L. Tenore, MD, board-certified physician and chief scientific officer for GoHydrate. \"Ayurveda, an ancient holistic healing system, mentions the concept of sol\u00e9 water in texts like the Charaka Samhita and the Sushruta Samhita,\" she says. \"The term 'sol\u00e9' derives from the Sanskrit word for 'sun'\u2014and it involves saturating purified water with Himalayan salt crystals.\" Even if you've never heard of sol\u00e9 water or made it at home, you probably notice a difference in the taste of various water sources\u2014and even have a preference. Consider tasting tap water in Europe versus drinking from the tap in the United States. Generally speaking, European water contains a higher mineral content and, thus, could taste a tad salty and different if you're not used to it. Mineral water is the most preferred drink in Germany, with 142 liters consumed per year per capita, says Samantha Harte, DPT, yoga-certified physical therapist of Strong Harte Fitness. \"Early inhabitants discovered that the rainwater washing over volcanic mountains had a rich collection of minerals that made the water clean and tasty,\" Harte continues. \"All these years later, people are still consuming it because it promises both a purity of taste and potential of benefits.\" 7 Easy Ways to Drink More Water Every Day Does salt water improve hydration? Here's the thing: Salt water, or sol\u00e9 water, does technically hydrate you\u2014but in a way that's not completely necessary. Biomechanically, by adding salt to your body, you're helping the water hanging out outside of the actual cells get absorbed into the cell, says Nikki Gnozzio, personal trainer, strength and conditioning coach, and founder of Junction Bodyworks in New Jersey. Hence, it becomes useful or bioavailable for hydration. \"All the salt is doing is kind of being that bridge from the outer cell to the inner cell so that you can utilize the water more,\" Gnozzio explains. Nikki Gnozzio, personal trainer and founder of Junction Bodyworks \"If you're not a heavy sweater, there's absolutely no reason to be including these additional salts.\" \u2014 Nikki Gnozzio, personal trainer and founder of Junction Bodyworks Are there benefits to sol\u00e9 water? Is it just a fad? Are there actual benefits to consuming sol\u00e9 water? Well, yes and no, experts agree. Dr. Tenore notes that Himalayan salt is often considered superior due to its minimally processed state and rich mineral content. \"While it is true that Himalayan salt is hand-harvested and retains its distinctive pink color due to minimal processing and lack of bleaching, the additional minerals and electrolytes in it are present in relatively low concentrations,\" she says. \"Therefore, the claimed health benefits stemming from these minerals may be overestimated.\" Here are some of the known benefits\u2014as well as the exaggerated claims\u2014of drinking sol\u00e9 water. Sol\u00e9 water could benefit heavy sweaters. Gnozzio says that if you're a heavy sweater and you're doing strenuous, draining exercise that requires heavy sweating, then this is a good way to replenish your system. However: \"If you're not a heavy sweater, there's absolutely no reason to be including these additional salts,\" she adds. In other words, plain water is just fine! Sol\u00e9 water may help improve sleep\u2014but the research is limited. Dr. Tenore says that, while there is some scientific evidence suggesting a link between low salt levels and interrupted sleep, increasing salt intake is not a universal solution. \"People with high blood pressure should avoid increasing their salt consumption for sleep improvement,\" she adds. Put Down the Sugary Sports Drink\u2014These 9 Foods Naturally Replenish Electrolytes Sol\u00e9 water may provide a hydration boost. Will drinking a salt water solution hydrate you? Definitely\u2014simply put, sol\u00e9 water mainly consists of water, contributing to overall hydration. \"However, excessive water intake can lead to hyponatremia, a condition where blood sodium levels become too low,\" Dr. Tenore warns. \"Consuming sol\u00e9 water in moderation can be beneficial for most healthy individuals. Remember, the other electrolytes and minerals in the Himalayan salt are insignificant.\" Sol\u00e9 water alone won't reduce your stress. While Dr. Tenore says, studies indicate that increased sodium levels may help regulate stress hormones during stressful situations. However, it's important to note that a bit of salt doesn't make you feel instantly less anxious or overwhelmed. Instead, managing your stress symptoms with long-term strategies\u2014through sustainable wellness habits like exercise, a balanced diet, consistent sleep schedules, and mindfulness\u2014is the most important. Not Drinking Enough Water Is One of the Worst Things You Can Do When Stressed\u2014Here's Why Sol\u00e9 water is not a weight loss solution. Contrary to claims, sol\u00e9 water does not possess specific properties that aid in weight loss. \"Proper hydration can help manage appetite, but solely relying on sol\u00e9 water for weight loss is not recommended,\" Dr. Tenore says. Is sol\u00e9 water dangerous? According to the American Heart Association, the human body needs 1,500 milligrams of sodium daily, and most people consume way more than that. Too-high sodium levels in your body can be hazardous, especially over a long period of time. Gnozzio warns if you have high cholesterol or high blood pressure, sol\u00e9 water can have negative effects. \"If you're adding more salt to the system when your doctors are trying to [reduce the] salt in your system that can also be dangerous,\" she adds. The Bottom Line Gnozzio reiterates that if you're not a heavy exerciser or endurance athlete, then there's most likely no reason to add salt to your water intake. If you're having trouble staying hydrated and need a lot of help replenishing lost fluids and electrolytes, she says it can be \"a good way to \"cheat the system\" efficiently\u2014but for the most part, it's not a magic wellness cure-all or the key to \"perfect\" or \"better\" hydration (despite what your favorite social media influencer claims). Keep sipping water throughout the day and eating plenty of fruits and veggies for all the hydration you need. 7 Signs You're Secretly Dehydrated (That Have Nothing to Do With Thirst) Was this page helpful?
