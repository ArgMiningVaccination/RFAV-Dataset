Age limit of Dependent children Children must be under age 26 as of the effective date of this EOC to enroll as a Dependent under your plan.

If we request it, the Subscriber must provide us documentation of the dependent's incapacity and dependency as follows: If the child is a Member, we will send the Subscriber a notice of the Dependent's membership termination due to loss of eligibility at least 90 days before the date coverage will end due to reaching the age limit. The Dependent's membership will terminate as described in our notice unless the Subscriber provides us documentation of the Dependent's incapacity and dependency within 60 days of receipt of our notice and we determine that the Dependent is eligible as a disabled dependent. If the Subscriber provides us this documentation in the specified time period and we do not make a determination about eligibility before the termination date, coverage will continue until we make a determination. If we determine that the Dependent does not meet the eligibility requirements as a disabled dependent, we will notify the Subscriber that the Dependent is not eligible and let the Subscriber know the membership termination date. If we determine that the Dependent is eligible as a disabled dependent, there will be no lapse in coverage. Also, starting two years after the date that the Dependent reached the age limit, the Subscriber must provide us documentation of the Dependent's incapacity and dependency annually within 60 days after we request it so that we can determine if the Dependent continues to be eligible as a disabled dependent If the child is not a Member because you are changing coverage, you must give us proof, within 60 days after we request it, of the child's incapacity and dependency as well as proof of the child's coverage under your prior coverage. In the future, you must provide proof of the child's continued incapacity and dependency within 60 days after you receive our request, but not more frequently than annually If the Subscriber is enrolled under a Kaiser Permanente Medicare plan The dependent eligibility rules described in the \"Eligibility as a Dependent\" section also apply if you are a subscriber under a Kaiser Permanente Medicare plan offered by your Group (please ask your Group about your membership options).

A \"non-Medicare\" evidence of coverage is one that does not require members to have Medicare. Persons barred from enrolling You cannot enroll if you have had your entitlement to receive Services through Health Plan terminated for cause. Sample Group ID: {PID} Kaiser Permanente 2022 Page 26 Members with Medicare and retirees This EOC is not intended for most Medicare beneficiaries and some Groups do not offer coverage to retirees. If, during the term of this EOC, you are (or become) eligible for Medicare or you retire, please ask your Group about your membership options as follows: If a Subscriber who has Medicare Part B retires and the Subscriber's Group has a Kaiser Permanente Senior Advantage plan for retirees, the Subscriber should enroll in the plan if eligible If the Subscriber has dependents who have Medicare and your Group has a Kaiser Permanente Senior Advantage plan (or of one our other plans that require members to have Medicare), the Subscriber may be able to enroll them as dependents under that plan If the Subscriber retires and your Group does not offer coverage to retirees, you may be eligible to continue membership as described in the \"Continuation of Membership\" section If federal law requires that your Group's health care coverage be primary and Medicare coverage be secondary, your coverage under this EOC will be the same as it would be if you had not become eligible for Medicare. However, you may also be eligible to enroll in Kaiser Permanente Senior Advantage through your Group if you have Medicare Part B If you are (or become) eligible for Medicare and are in a class of beneficiaries for which your Group's health care coverage is secondary to Medicare, you should consider enrollment in Kaiser Permanente Senior Advantage through your Group if you are eligible If none of the above applies to you and you are eligible for Medicare or you retire, please ask your Group about your membership options Note: If you are enrolled in a Medicare plan and lose Medicare eligibility, you may be able to enroll under this EOC if permitted by your Group (please ask your Group for details). When Medicare is primary Your Group's Premiums may increase if you are (or become) eligible for Medicare Part A or B as primary coverage, and you are not enrolled through your Group in Kaiser Permanente Senior Advantage for any reason (even if you are not eligible to enroll or the plan is not available to you). When Medicare is secondary Medicare is the primary coverage except when federal law requires that your Group's health care coverage be primary and Medicare coverage be secondary. Members who have Medicare when Medicare is secondary by law are subject to the same Premiums and receive the same benefits as Members who are under age 65 and do not have Medicare. In addition, any such Member for whom Medicare is secondary by law and who meets the eligibility requirements for the Kaiser Permanente Senior Advantage plan applicable when Medicare is secondary may also enroll in that plan if it is available. These Members receive the benefits and coverage described in this EOC and the Kaiser Permanente Senior Advantage evidence of coverage applicable when Medicare is secondary. Medicare late enrollment penalties If you become eligible for Medicare Part B and do not enroll, Medicare may require you to pay a late enrollment penalty if you later enroll in Medicare Part B. However, if you delay enrollment in Part B because you or your spouse are still working and have coverage through an employer group health plan, you may not have to pay the penalty. Also, if you are (or become) eligible for Medicare and go without creditable prescription drug coverage (drug coverage that is at least as good as the standard Medicare Part D prescription drug coverage) for a continuous period of 63 days or more, you may have to pay a late enrollment penalty if you later sign up for Medicare prescription drug coverage. If you are (or become) eligible for Medicare, your Group is responsible for informing you about whether your drug coverage under this EOC is creditable prescription drug coverage at the times required by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and upon your request. How to Enroll and When Coverage Begins Your Group is required to inform you when you are eligible to enroll and what your effective date of coverage is. If you are eligible to enroll as described under \"Who Is Eligible\" in this \"Premiums, Eligibility, and Enrollment\" section, enrollment is permitted as described below and membership begins at the beginning (12:00 a.m.) of the effective date of coverage indicated below, except that your Group may have additional requirements, which allow enrollment in other situations. If you are eligible to be a Dependent under this EOC but the subscriber in your family is enrolled under a Kaiser Permanente Senior Advantage evidence of coverage offered by your Group, the rules for enrollment of Dependents in this \"How to Enroll and When Coverage Begins\" section apply, not the rules for enrollment of dependents in the subscriber's evidence of coverage. Sample Group ID: {PID} 2022 Page 27 New employees When your Group informs you that you are eligible to enroll as a Subscriber, you may enroll yourself and any eligible Dependents by submitting a Health Plan- approved enrollment application to your Group within 31 days. Effective date of coverage The effective date of coverage for new employees and their eligible family Dependents is determined by your Group in accord with waiting period requirements in state and federal law. Your Group is required to inform the Subscriber of the date your membership becomes effective. For example, if the hire date of an otherwise- eligible employee is January 19, the waiting period begins on January 19 and the effective date of coverage cannot be any later than April 19. Note: If the effective date of your Group's coverage is always on the first day of the month, in this example the effective date cannot be any later than April 1. Open enrollment You may enroll as a Subscriber (along with any eligible Dependents), and existing Subscribers may add eligible Dependents, by submitting a Health Plan-approved enrollment application to your Group during your Group's open enrollment period. Your Group will let you know when the open enrollment period begins and ends and the effective date of coverage. Special enrollment If you do not enroll when you are first eligible and later want to enroll, you can enroll only during open enrollment unless one of the following is true: You become eligible because you experience a qualifying event (sometimes called a \"triggering event\") as described in this \"Special enrollment\" section You did not enroll in any coverage offered by your Group when you were first eligible and your Group does not give us a written statement that verifies you signed a document that explained restrictions about enrolling in the future. The effective date of an enrollment resulting from this provision is no later than the first day of the month following the date your Group receives a Health Plan-approved enrollment or change of enrollment application from the Subscriber Special enrollment due to new Dependents You may enroll as a Subscriber (along with eligible Dependents), and existing Subscribers may add eligible Dependents, within 30 days after marriage, establishment of domestic partnership, birth, adoption, or placement for adoption by submitting to your Group a Health Plan- approved enrollment application. The effective date of an enrollment resulting from marriage or establishment of domestic partnership is no later than the first day of the month following the date your Group receives an enrollment application from the Subscriber. Enrollments due to birth, adoption, or placement for adoption are effective on the date of birth, date of adoption, or the date you or your Spouse have newly assumed a legal right to control health care in anticipation of adoption. Special enrollment due to loss of other coverage You may enroll as a Subscriber (along with any eligible Dependents), and existing Subscribers may add eligible Dependents, if all of the following are true: The Subscriber or at least one of the Dependents had other coverage when they previously declined all coverage through your Group The loss of the other coverage is due to one of the following: exhaustion of COBRA coverage termination of employer contributions for non- COBRA coverage loss of eligibility for non-COBRA coverage, but not termination for cause or termination from an individual (nongroup) plan for nonpayment. For example, this loss of eligibility may be due to legal separation or divorce, moving out of the plan's service area, reaching the age limit for dependent children, or the subscriber's death, termination of employment, or reduction in hours of employment loss of eligibility (but not termination for cause) for coverage through Covered California, Medicaid coverage (known as Medi-Cal in California), Children's Health Insurance Program coverage, or Medi-Cal Access Program coverage reaching a lifetime maximum on all benefits Note: If you are enrolling yourself as a Subscriber along with at least one eligible Dependent, only one of you must meet the requirements stated above. To request enrollment, the Subscriber must submit a Health Plan-approved enrollment or change of enrollment application to your Group within 30 days after loss of other coverage, except that the timeframe for submitting the application is 60 days if you are requesting enrollment due to loss of eligibility for coverage through Covered California, Medicaid, Children's Health Insurance Program, or Medi-Cal Access Program coverage. The effective date of an Sample Group ID: {PID} Kaiser Permanente 2022 Page 28 enrollment resulting from loss of other coverage is no later than the first day of the month following the date your Group receives an enrollment or change of enrollment application from the Subscriber. Special enrollment due to court or administrative order Within 30 days after the date of a court or administrative order requiring a Subscriber to provide health care coverage for a Spouse or child who meets the eligibility requirements as a Dependent, the Subscriber may add the Spouse or child as a Dependent by submitting to your Group a Health Plan-approved enrollment or change of enrollment application. The effective date of coverage resulting from a court or administrative order is the first of the month following the date we receive the enrollment request, unless your Group specifies a different effective date (if your Group specifies a different effective date, the effective date cannot be earlier than the date of the order). Special enrollment due to eligibility for premium assistance You may enroll as a Subscriber (along with eligible Dependents), and existing Subscribers may add eligible Dependents, if you or a dependent become eligible for premium assistance through the Medi-Cal program. Premium assistance is when the Medi-Cal program pays all or part of premiums for employer group coverage for a Medi-Cal beneficiary. To request enrollment in your Group's health care coverage, the Subscriber must submit a Health Plan-approved enrollment or change of enrollment application to your Group within 60 days after you or a dependent become eligible for premium assistance. Please contact the California Department of Health Care Services to find out if premium assistance is available and the eligibility requirements. Special enrollment due to reemployment after military service If you terminated your health care coverage because you were called to active duty in the military service, you may be able to reenroll in your Group's health plan if required by state or federal law. Please ask your Group for more information. Other special enrollment events You may enroll as a Subscriber (along with any eligible Dependents) if you or your Dependents were not previously enrolled, and existing Subscribers may add eligible Dependents not previously enrolled, if any of the following are true: You lose employment for a reason other than gross misconduct Your employment hours are reduced You are a Dependent of someone who becomes entitled to Medicare You become divorced or legally separated You are a Dependent of someone who dies A Health Benefit Exchange (such as Covered California) determines that one of the following occurred because of misconduct on the part of a non- Exchange entity that provided enrollment assistance or conducted enrollment activities: a qualified individual was not enrolled in a qualified health plan a qualified individual was not enrolled in the qualified health plan that the individual selected a qualified individual is eligible for, but is not receiving, advance payments of the premium tax credit or cost share reductions To request special enrollment, you must submit a Health Plan-approved enrollment application to your Group within 30 days after loss of other coverage. You may be required to provide documentation that you have experienced a qualifying event. Membership becomes effective either on the first day of the next month (for applications that are received by the fifteenth day of a month) or on the first day of the month following the next month (for applications that are received after the fifteenth day of a month). Note: If you are enrolling as a Subscriber along with at least one eligible Dependent, only one of you must meet one of the requirements stated above. How to Obtain Services As a Member, you are selecting our medical care program to provide your health care. You must receive all covered care from Plan Providers inside our Service Area, except as described in the sections listed below for the following Services: Authorized referrals as described under \"Getting a Referral\" in this \"How to Obtain Services\" section Emergency ambulance Services as described under \"Ambulance Services\" in the \"Benefits\" section Emergency Services, Post-Stabilization Care, and Out-of-Area Urgent Care as described in the \"Emergency Services and Urgent Care\" section Hospice care as described under \"Hospice Care\" in the \"Benefits\" section Sample Group 2022 Page 29 Covered Services received outside of your Home Region Service Area as described under \"Receiving Care Outside of Your Home Region Service Area\" in this \"How to Obtain Services\" section Our medical care program gives you access to all of the covered Services you may need, such as routine care with your own personal Plan Physician, hospital Services, laboratory and pharmacy Services, Emergency Services, Urgent Care, and other benefits described in this EOC. Routine Care If you need the following Services, you should schedule an appointment: Preventive Services Periodic follow-up care (regularly scheduled follow- up care, such as visits to monitor a chronic condition) Other care that is not Urgent Care To request a non-urgent appointment, you can call your local Plan Facility or request the appointment online. For appointment phone numbers, refer to our Provider Directory or call Member Services. To request an appointment online, go to our website at kp.org . Urgent Care An Urgent Care need is one that requires prompt medical attention but is not an Emergency Medical Condition. If you think you may need Urgent Care, call the appropriate appointment or advice phone number at a Plan Facility. For phone numbers, refer to our Provider Directory or call Member Services. For information about Out-of-Area Urgent Care, refer to \"Urgent Care\" in the \"Emergency Services and Urgent Care\" section. Not Sure What Kind of Care You Need? Sometimes it's difficult to know what kind of care you need, so we have licensed health care professionals available to assist you by phone 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Here are some of the ways they can help you: They can answer questions about a health concern, and instruct you on self-care at home if appropriate They can advise you about whether you should get medical care, and how and where to get care (for example, if you are not sure whether your condition is an Emergency Medical Condition, they can help you decide whether you need Emergency Services or Urgent Care, and how and where to get that care) They can tell you what to do if you need care and a Plan Medical Office is closed or you are outside our Service Area You can reach one of these licensed health care professionals by calling the appointment or advice phone number (for phone numbers, refer to our Provider Directory or call Member Services). When you call, a trained support person may ask you questions to help determine how to direct your call. Your Personal Plan Physician Personal Plan Physicians provide primary care and play an important role in coordinating care, including hospital stays and referrals to specialists. We encourage you to choose a personal Plan Physician. You may choose any available personal Plan Physician. Parents may choose a pediatrician as the personal Plan Physician for their child. Most personal Plan Physicians are Primary Care Physicians (generalists in internal medicine, pediatrics, or family practice, or specialists in obstetrics/gynecology whom the Medical Group designates as Primary Care Physicians). Some specialists who are not designated as Primary Care Physicians but who also provide primary care may be available as personal Plan Physicians. For example, some specialists in internal medicine and obstetrics/gynecology who are not designated as Primary Care Physicians may be available as personal Plan Physicians. However, if you choose a specialist who is not designated as a Primary Care Physician as your personal Plan Physician, the Cost Share for a Physician Specialist Visit will apply to all visits with the specialist except for routine preventive visits listed under \"Preventive Services\" in the \"Benefits\" section. To learn how to select or change to a different personal Plan Physician, visit our website at kp.org or call Member Services. Refer to our Provider Directory for a list of physicians that are available as Primary Care Physicians. The directory is updated periodically. The availability of Primary Care Physicians may change. If you have questions, please call Member Services. You can change your personal Plan Physician at any time for any reason. Sample Group ID: {PID} Kaiser Permanente 2022 Page 30 Getting a Referral Referrals to Plan Providers A Plan Physician must refer you before you can receive care from specialists, such as specialists in surgery, orthopedics, cardiology, oncology, dermatology, and physical, occupational, and speech therapies. Also, a Plan Physician must refer you before you can get care from Qualified Autism Service Providers covered under \"Behavioral Health Treatment for Autism Spectrum Disorder\" in the \"Benefits\" section. However, you do not need a referral or prior authorization to receive most care from any of the following Plan Providers: Your personal Plan Physician Generalists in internal medicine, pediatrics, and family practice Specialists in optometry, mental health Services, substance use disorder treatment, and obstetrics/gynecology A Plan Physician must refer you before you can get care from a specialist in urology except that you do not need a referral to receive Services related to sexual or reproductive health, such as a vasectomy. Although a referral or prior authorization is not required to receive most care from these providers, a referral may be required in the following situations: The provider may have to get prior authorization for certain Services in accord with \"Medical Group authorization procedure for certain referrals\" in this \"Getting a Referral\" section The provider may have to refer you to a specialist who has a clinical background related to your illness or condition Standing referrals If a Plan Physician refers you to a specialist, the referral will be for a specific treatment plan. Your treatment plan may include a standing referral if ongoing care from the specialist is prescribed. For example, if you have a life- threatening, degenerative, or disabling condition, you can get a standing referral to a specialist if ongoing care from the specialist is required. Medical Group authorization procedure for certain referrals The following are examples of Services that require prior authorization by the Medical Group for the Services to be covered (\"prior authorization\" means that the Medical Group must approve the Services in advance): Durable medical equipment Ostomy and urological supplies Services not available from Plan Providers Transplants Utilization Management (\"UM\") is a process that determines whether a Service recommended by your treating provider is Medically Necessary for you. Prior authorization is a UM process that determines whether the requested services are Medically Necessary before care is provided. If it is Medically Necessary, then you will receive authorization to obtain that care in a clinically appropriate place consistent with the terms of your health coverage. Decisions regarding requests for authorization will be made only by licensed physicians or other appropriately licensed medical professionals. For the complete list of Services that require prior authorization, and the criteria that are used to make authorization decisions, please visit our website at kp.org/UM or call Member Services to request a printed copy. Refer to \"Post-Stabilization Care\" under \"Emergency Services\" in the \"Emergency Services and Urgent Care\" section for authorization requirements that apply to Post- Stabilization Care from Non-Plan Providers. Additional information about prior authorization for durable medical equipment and ostomy and urological supplies The prior authorization process for durable medical equipment and ostomy and urological supplies includes the use of formulary guidelines. These guidelines were developed by a multidisciplinary clinical and operational work group with review and input from Plan Physicians and medical professionals with clinical expertise. The formulary guidelines are periodically updated to keep pace with changes in medical technology and clinical practice. If your Plan Physician prescribes one of these items, they will submit a written referral in accord with the UM process described in this \"Medical Group authorization procedure for certain referrals\" section. If the formulary guidelines do not specify that the prescribed item is appropriate for your medical condition, the referral will be submitted to the Medical Group's designee Plan Physician, who will make an authorization decision as described under \"Medical Group's decision time frames\" in this \"Medical Group authorization procedure for certain referrals\" section. Medical Group's decision time frames The applicable Medical Group designee will make the authorization decision within the time frame appropriate for your condition, but no later than five business days Sample Group ID: {PID} Kaiser Permanente 2022 Page 31 after receiving all of the information (including additional examination and test results) reasonably necessary to make the decision, except that decisions about urgent Services will be made no later than 72 hours after receipt of the information reasonably necessary to make the decision. If the Medical Group needs more time to make the decision because it doesn't have information reasonably necessary to make the decision, or because it has requested consultation by a particular specialist, you and your treating physician will be informed about the additional information, testing, or specialist that is needed, and the date that the Medical Group expects to make a decision. Your treating physician will be informed of the decision within 24 hours after the decision is made. If the Services are authorized, your physician will be informed of the scope of the authorized Services. If the Medical Group does not authorize all of the Services, Health Plan will send you a written decision and explanation within two business days after the decision is made. Any written criteria that the Medical Group uses to make the decision to authorize, modify, delay, or deny the request for authorization will be made available to you upon request. If the Medical Group does not authorize all of the Services requested and you want to appeal the decision, you can file a grievance as described under \"Grievances\" in the \"Dispute Resolution\" section. For these referral Services, you pay the Cost Share required for Services provided by a Plan Provider as described in this EOC. Travel and lodging for certain referrals The following are examples of when we will arrange or provide reimbursement for certain travel and lodging expenses in accord with our Travel and Lodging Program Description: If Medical Group refers you to a provider that is more than 50 miles from where you live for certain specialty Services such as bariatric surgery, complex thoracic surgery, transplant nephrectomy, or inpatient chemotherapy for leukemia and lymphoma If Medical Group refers you to a provider that is outside our Service Area for certain specialty Services such as a transplant or transgender surgery For the complete list of specialty Services for which we will arrange or provide reimbursement for travel and lodging expenses, the amount of reimbursement, limitations and exclusions, and how to request reimbursement, refer to the Travel and Lodging Program Description.

To request prior authorization, the Non-Plan Provider must call 1-800-225-8883 or the notification phone number on your Kaiser Permanente ID card before you receive the care. We will discuss your condition with the Non-Plan Provider. If we determine that you require Post-Stabilization Care and that this care is part of your covered benefits, we will authorize your care from the Non-Plan Provider or arrange to have a Plan Provider (or other designated provider) provide the care. If we decide to have a Plan Hospital, Plan Skilled Nursing Facility, or designated Non-Plan Provider provide your care, we may authorize special transportation services that are medically required to get you to the provider. This may include transportation that is otherwise not covered. Be sure to ask the Non-Plan Provider to tell you what care (including any transportation) we have authorized because we will not cover Post-Stabilization Care or related transportation provided by Non-Plan Providers that has not been authorized. If you receive care from a Sample Group ID: {PID} Kaiser Permanente Page 36 Non-Plan Provider that we have not authorized, you may have to pay the full cost of that care. If you are admitted to a Non-Plan Hospital, please notify us as soon as possible by calling 1-800-225-8883 or the notification phone number on your ID card. Your Cost Share Your Cost Share for covered Emergency Services and Post-Stabilization Care is described in the \"Cost Share Summary\" section of this EOC.

Your Cost Share Your Cost Share for covered Urgent Care is the Cost Share required for Services provided by Plan Providers as described in the \"Cost Share Summary\" section of this EOC. For example: If you receive an Urgent Care evaluation as part of covered Out-of-Area Urgent Care from a Non-Plan Provider, you pay the Cost Share for Urgent Care consultations, evaluations, and treatment as described in the \"Cost Share Summary\" under \"Emergency Services and Urgent Care\" If the Out-of-Area Urgent Care you receive includes an X-ray, you pay the Cost Share for an X-ray as described in the \"Cost Share Summary\" under \"Outpatient imaging, laboratory, and other diagnostic and treatment Services,\" in addition to the Cost Share for the Urgent Care evaluation If we gave prior authorization for durable medical equipment provided as part of Out-of-Area Urgent Care, you pay the Cost Share for durable medical equipment as described in the \"Cost Share Summary\" under \"Durable Medical Equipment (\"DME\") for home use\" Note: If you receive Urgent Care in an emergency department, you pay the Cost Share for an emergency department visit as described in the \"Cost Share Summary\" under \"Emergency Services and Urgent Care.\" Sample 2022 Page 37 Payment and Reimbursement If you receive Emergency Services, Post-Stabilization Care, or Out-of-Area Urgent Care from a Non-Plan Provider as described in this \"Emergency Services and Urgent Care\" section, or emergency ambulance Services described under \"Ambulance Services\" in the \"Benefits\" section, you are not responsible for any amounts beyond your Cost Share for covered Emergency Services. However, if the provider does not agree to bill us, you may have to pay for the Services and file a claim for reimbursement. Also, you may be required to pay and file a claim for any Services prescribed by a Non-Plan Provider as part of covered Emergency Services, Post- Stabilization Care, and Out-of-Area Urgent Care even if you receive the Services from a Plan Provider, such as a Plan Pharmacy.

Services are covered under this EOC as specifically described in this EOC. Services that are not specifically described in this EOC are not covered, except as required by state or federal law. Services are subject to exclusions and limitations described in the \"Exclusions, Limitations, Coordination of Benefits, and Reductions\" section. Except as otherwise described in this EOC, all of the following conditions must be satisfied: You are a Member on the date that you receive the Services The Services are Medically Necessary The Services are one of the following: Preventive Services health care items and services for diagnosis, assessment, or treatment health education covered under \"Health Education\" in this \"Benefits\" section other health care items and services The Services are provided, prescribed, authorized, or directed by a Plan Physician, except for: drugs prescribed by dentists, as described under \"Outpatient Prescription Drugs, Supplies, and Supplements\" below emergency ambulance Services, as described under \"Ambulance Services\" below Emergency Services, Post-Stabilization Care, and Out-of-Area Urgent Care, as described in the \"Emergency Services and Urgent Care\" section Covered Services received outside of your Home Region Service Area, as described under \"Receiving Care Outside of Your Home Region Service Area\" in the \"How to Obtain Services\" section You receive the Services from Plan Providers inside our Service Area, except for: authorized referrals, as described under \"Getting a Referral\" in the \"How to Obtain Services\" section emergency ambulance Services, as described under \"Ambulance Services\" below Emergency Services, Post-Stabilization Care, and Out-of-Area Urgent Care, as described in the \"Emergency Services and Urgent Care\" section hospice care, as described under \"Hospice Care\" below Covered Services received outside of your Home Region Service Area, as described under \"Receiving Care Outside of Your Home Region Service Area\" in the \"How to Obtain Services\" section The Medical Group has given prior authorization for the Services, if required, as described under \"Medical Group authorization procedure for certain referrals\" in the \"How to Obtain Services\" section Please also refer to: The \"Emergency Services and Urgent Care\" section for information about how to obtain covered Emergency Services, Post-Stabilization Care, and Out-of-Area Urgent Care Our Provider Directory for the types of covered Services that are available from each Plan Facility, because some facilities provide only specific types of covered Services Your Cost Share Your Cost Share is the amount you are required to pay for covered Services. For example, your Cost Share may be a Copayment or Coinsurance. If your coverage includes a Plan Deductible and you receive Services that are subject to the Plan Deductible, your Cost Share for those Services will be Charges until you reach the Plan Deductible. Similarly, if your coverage includes a Drug Deductible, and you receive Services that are subject to the Drug Deductible, your Sample Group ID: {PID} Kaiser Permanente 2022 Page 38 Cost Share for those Services will be Charges until you reach the Drug Deductible. Refer to the \"Cost Share Summary\" section of this EOC for the amount you will pay for Services. General rules, examples, and exceptions Your Cost Share for covered Services will be the Cost Share in effect on the date you receive the Services, except as follows: If you are receiving covered hospital inpatient or Skilled Nursing Facility Services on the effective date of this EOC, you pay the Cost Share in effect on your admission date until you are discharged if the Services were covered under your prior Health Plan evidence of coverage and there has been no break in coverage. However, if the Services were not covered under your prior Health Plan evidence of coverage, or if there has been a break in coverage, you pay the Cost Share in effect on the date you receive the Services For items ordered in advance, you pay the Cost Share in effect on the order date (although we will not cover the item unless you still have coverage for it on the date you receive it) and you may be required to pay the Cost Share when the item is ordered. For outpatient prescription drugs, the order date is the date that the pharmacy processes the order after receiving all of the information they need to fill the prescription Cost Share for Services received by newborn children of a Member During the 31 days of automatic coverage for newborn children described under \"If you have a baby\" under \"Who Is Eligible\" in the \"Premiums, Eligibility, and Enrollment\" section, the parent or guardian of the newborn must pay the Cost Share indicated in the \"Cost Share Summary\" section of this EOC for any Services that the newborn receives, whether or not the newborn is enrolled. When the \"Cost Share Summary\" indicates the Services are subject to the Plan Deductible, the Cost Share for those Services will be Charges if the newborn has not met the Plan Deductible. Payment toward your Cost Share (and when you may be billed) In most cases, your provider will ask you to make a payment toward your Cost Share at the time you receive Services. If you receive more than one type of Services (such as a routine physical maintenance exam and laboratory tests), you may be required to pay separate Cost Share for each of those Services. Keep in mind that your payment toward your Cost Share may cover only a portion of your total Cost Share for the Services you receive, and you will be billed for any additional amounts that are due. The following are examples of when you may be asked to pay (or you may be billed for) Cost Share amounts in addition to the amount you pay at check-in: You receive non-preventive Services during a preventive visit. For example, you go in for a routine physical maintenance exam, and at check-in you pay your Cost Share for the preventive exam (your Cost Share may be \"no charge\"). However, during your preventive exam your provider finds a problem with your health and orders non-preventive Services to diagnose your problem (such as laboratory tests). You may be asked to pay (or you will be billed for) your Cost Share for these additional non-preventive diagnostic Services You receive diagnostic Services during a treatment visit. For example, you go in for treatment of an existing health condition, and at check-in you pay your Cost Share for a treatment visit. However, during the visit your provider finds a new problem with your health and performs or orders diagnostic Services (such as laboratory tests). You may be asked to pay (or you will be billed for) your Cost Share for these additional diagnostic Services You receive treatment Services during a diagnostic visit. For example, you go in for a diagnostic exam, and at check-in you pay your Cost Share for a diagnostic exam. However, during the diagnostic exam your provider confirms a problem with your health and performs treatment Services (such as an outpatient procedure). You may be asked to pay (or you will be billed for) your Cost Share for these additional treatment Services You receive Services from a second provider during your visit. For example, you go in for a diagnostic exam, and at check-in you pay your Cost Share for a diagnostic exam. However, during the diagnostic exam your provider requests a consultation with a specialist. You may be asked to pay (or you will be billed for) your Cost Share for the consultation with the specialist In some cases, your provider will not ask you to make a payment at the time you receive Services, and you will be billed for your Cost Share (for example, some Laboratory Departments are not able to collect Cost Share, or your Plan Provider is not able to collect Cost Share, if any, for Telehealth Visits you receive at home). When we send you a bill, it will list Charges for the Services you received, payments and credits applied to your account, and any amounts you still owe. Your current bill may not always reflect your most recent Sample Group ID: {PID} Kaiser Permanente 2022 Page 39 Charges and payments. Any Charges and payments that are not on the current bill will appear on a future bill. Sometimes, you may see a payment but not the related Charges for Services. That could be because your payment was recorded before the Charges for the Services were processed. If so, the Charges will appear on a future bill. Also, you may receive more than one bill for a single outpatient visit or inpatient stay. For example, you may receive a bill for physician services and a separate bill for hospital services. If you don't see all the Charges for Services on one bill, they will appear on a future bill. If we determine that you overpaid and are due a refund, then we will send a refund to you within four weeks after we make that determination. If you have questions about a bill, please call the phone number on the bill. In some cases, a Non-Plan Provider may be involved in the provision of covered Services at a Plan Facility or a contracted facility where we have authorized you to receive care. You are not responsible for any amounts beyond your Cost Share for the covered Services you receive at Plan Facilities or at contracted facilities where we have authorized you to receive care. However, if the provider does not agree to bill us, you may have to pay for the Services and file a claim for reimbursement. For information on how to file a claim, please see the \"Post- Service Claims and Appeals\" section. Primary Care Visits, Non-Physician Specialist Visits, and Physician Specialist Visits The Cost Share for a Primary Care Visit applies to evaluations and treatment provided by generalists in internal medicine, pediatrics, or family practice, and by specialists in obstetrics/gynecology whom the Medical Group designates as Primary Care Physicians. Some physician specialists provide primary care in addition to specialty care but are not designated as Primary Care Physicians. If you receive Services from one of these specialists, the Cost Share for a Physician Specialist Visit will apply to all consultations, evaluations, and treatment provided by the specialist except for routine preventive counseling and exams listed under \"Preventive Services\" in this \"Benefits\" section. For example, if your personal Plan Physician is a specialist in internal medicine or obstetrics/gynecology who is not a Primary Care Physician, you will pay the Cost Share for a Physician Specialist Visit for all consultations, evaluations, and treatment by the specialist except routine preventive counseling and exams listed under \"Preventive Services\" in this \"Benefits\" section. The Non-Physician Specialist Visit Cost Share applies to consultations, evaluations, and treatment provided by non-physician specialists (such as nurse practitioners, physician assistants, optometrists, podiatrists, and audiologists). Noncovered Services If you receive Services that are not covered under this EOC, you may have to pay the full price of those Services. Payments you make for noncovered Services do not apply to any deductible or out-of-pocket maximum. Benefit limits Some benefits may include a limit on the number of visits, days, or dollar amount that will be covered under your plan during a specified time period. If a benefit includes a limit, this will be indicated in the \"Cost Share Summary\" section of this EOC. The time period associated with a benefit limit may not be the same as the term of this EOC. We will count all Services you receive during the benefit limit period toward the benefit limit, including Services you received under a prior Health Plan EOC (as long as you have continuous coverage with Health Plan). Note: We will not count Services you received under a prior Health Plan EOC when you first enroll in individual plan coverage or a new employer group's plan, when you move from group to individual plan coverage (or vice versa), or when you received Services under a Kaiser Permanente Senior Advantage evidence of coverage. If you are enrolled in the Kaiser Permanente POS Plan, refer to your KPIC Certificate of Insurance and Schedule of Coverage for benefit limits that apply to your separate indemnity coverage provided by the Kaiser Permanente Insurance Company (\"KPIC\"). Getting an estimate of your Cost Share If you have questions about the Cost Share for specific Services that you expect to receive or that your provider orders during a visit or procedure, please visit our website at kp.org/memberestimates to use our cost estimate tool or call Member Services. If you have a Plan Deductible and would like an estimate for Services that are subject to the Plan Deductible, please call 1800-390-3507 (TTY users call 711) Monday through Friday 6 a.m. to 5 p.m. Refer to the \"Cost Share Summary\" section of this EOC to find out if you have a Plan Deductible For all other Cost Share estimates, please call 1800- 464-4000 (TTY users call 711) 24 hours a day, seven days a week (except closed holidays) Cost Share estimates are based on your benefits and the Services you expect to receive. They are a prediction of cost and not a guarantee of the final cost of Services. Your final cost may be higher or lower than the estimate since not everything about your care can be known in advance. Sample Group ID: {PID} Kaiser Permanente 2022 Page 40 Drug Deductible This EOC does not include a Drug Deductible. Plan Deductible This EOC does not include a Plan Deductible. Copayments and Coinsurance The Copayment or Coinsurance you must pay for each covered Service, after you meet any applicable deductible, is described in this EOC. Note: If Charges for Services are less than the Copayment described in this EOC, you will pay the lesser amount, subject to any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket maximum. Plan Out-of-Pocket Maximum There is a limit to the total amount of Cost Share you must pay under this EOC in the Accumulation Period for covered Services that you receive in the same Accumulation Period. The Services that apply to the Plan Out-of-Pocket Maximum are described under the \"Payments that count toward the Plan Out-of-Pocket Maximum\" section below. Refer to the \"Cost Share Summary\" section of this EOC for your applicable Plan Out-of-Pocket Maximum amounts. If you are a Member in a Family of two or more Members, you reach the Plan Out-of-Pocket Maximum either when you reach the maximum for any one Member, or when your Family reaches the Family maximum. For example, suppose you have reached the Plan Out-of-Pocket Maximum for any one Member. For Services subject to the Plan Out-of-Pocket Maximum, you will not pay any more Cost Share during the remainder of the Accumulation Period, but every other Member in your Family must continue to pay Cost Share during the remainder of the Accumulation Period until either they reach the maximum for any one Member or your Family reaches the Family maximum. Payments that count toward the Plan Out-of-Pocket Maximum Any payments you make toward the Plan Deductible or Drug Deductible, if applicable, apply toward the maximum. Most Copayments and Coinsurance you pay for covered Services apply to the maximum, however some may not. To find out whether a Copayment or Coinsurance for a covered Service will apply to the maximum refer to the \"Cost Share Summary\" section of this EOC . If your plan includes pediatric dental Services described in a Pediatric Dental Services Amendment to this EOC, those Services will apply toward the maximum. If your plan has a Pediatric Dental Services Amendment, it will be attached to this EOC, and it will be listed in the EOC's Table of Contents. Accrual toward deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums To see how close you are to reaching your deductibles, if any, and out-of-pocket maximums, use our online Out- of-Pocket Summary tool at kp.org/outofpocket or call Member Services.

Some providers have contracted with Kaiser Permanente to provide certain Services to Members at rates that are typically less than the fees that the providers ordinarily charge to the general public (\"General Fees\"). However, these contracts may allow the providers to recover all or a portion of the difference between the fees paid by Kaiser Permanente and their General Fees by means of a lien claim under California Civil Code Sections 3045.1- 3045.6 against a judgment or settlement that you receive from or on behalf of another party. For Services the provider furnished, our recovery and the provider's recovery together will not exceed the provider's General Fees. Surrogacy Arrangements If you enter into a Surrogacy Arrangement and you or any other payee are entitled to receive payments or other compensation under the Surrogacy Arrangement, you must reimburse us for covered Services you receive related to conception, pregnancy, delivery, or postpartum care in connection with that arrangement (\"Surrogacy Health Services\") to the maximum extent allowed under California Civil Code Section 3040. Note: This \"Surrogacy Arrangements\" section does not affect your obligation to pay your Cost Share for these Services. After you surrender a baby to the legal parents, you are not obligated to reimburse us for any Services that the baby receives (the legal parents are financially responsible for any Services that the baby receives). By accepting Surrogacy Health Services, you automatically assign to us your right to receive payments that are payable to you or any other payee under the Surrogacy Arrangement, regardless of whether those payments are characterized as being for medical expenses. To secure our rights, we will also have a lien on those payments and on any escrow account, trust, or any other account that holds those payments. Those payments (and amounts in any escrow account, trust, or other account that holds those payments) shall first be applied to satisfy our lien. The assignment and our lien will not exceed the total amount of your obligation to us under the preceding paragraph. Within 30 days after entering into a Surrogacy Arrangement, you must send written notice of the arrangement, including all of the following information: Names, addresses, and phone numbers of the other parties to the arrangement Names, addresses, and phone numbers of any escrow agent or trustee Names, addresses, and phone numbers of the intended parents and any other parties who are financially responsible for Services the baby (or babies) receive, including names, addresses, and phone numbers for any health insurance that will cover Services that the baby (or babies) receive A signed copy of any contracts and other documents explaining the arrangement Any other information we request in order to satisfy our rights You must send this information to: Equian Kaiser Permanente - Northern California Region Surrogacy Mailbox P.O. Box 36380 Louisville, KY 40233 Fax: 1-502-214-1137 You must complete and send us all consents, releases, authorizations, lien forms, and other documents that are reasonably necessary for us to determine the existence of any rights we may have under this \"Surrogacy Arrangements\" section and to satisfy those rights. You may not agree to waive, release, or reduce our rights under this \"Surrogacy Arrangements\" section without our prior, written consent. If your estate, parent, guardian, or conservator asserts a claim against another party based on the Surrogacy Arrangement, your estate, parent, guardian, or conservator and any settlement or judgment recovered by the estate, parent, guardian, or conservator shall be subject to our liens and other rights to the same extent as if you had asserted the claim against the other party. We may assign our rights to enforce our liens and other rights. If you have questions about your obligations under this provision, please call Member Services.

You may also submit a request for an Independent Medical Review as described under \"Independent Medical Review\" in this \"Dispute Resolution\" section. Department of Managed Health Care Complaints The California Department of Managed Health Care is responsible for regulating health care service plans. If you have a grievance against your health plan, you should first telephone your health plan toll free at 1800-464-4000 (TTY users call 711) and use your health plan's grievance process before contacting the department. Utilizing this grievance procedure does not prohibit any potential legal rights or remedies that may be available to you. If you need help with a grievance involving an emergency, a grievance that has not been satisfactorily resolved by your health plan, or a grievance that has remained unresolved for more than 30 days, you may call the department for assistance. You may also be eligible for an Independent Medical Review (IMR). If you are eligible for IMR, the IMR process will provide an impartial review of medical decisions made by a health plan related to the medical necessity of a proposed service or treatment, coverage decisions for treatments that are experimental or investigational in nature and payment disputes for emergency or urgent medical services. The department also has a toll-free telephone number (1-888-466-2219) and a TDD line (1-877-688-9891) for the hearing and speech impaired. The department's Internet website www.dmhc.ca.gov has complaint forms, IMR application forms and instructions online. Independent Medical Review (\"IMR\") Except as described in this \"Independent Medical Review (\"IMR\")\" section, you must exhaust our internal grievance procedure before you may request independent medical review unless we have failed to comply with the grievance procedure described under \"Grievances\" in this \"Dispute Resolution\" section. If you qualify, you or your authorized representative may have your issue reviewed through the IMR process managed by the California Department of Managed Health Care Sample Group ID: {PID} Kaiser Permanente (\"DMHC\"). The DMHC determines which cases qualify for IMR. This review is at no cost to you. If you decide not to request an IMR, you may give up the right to pursue some legal actions against us. You may qualify for IMR if all of the following are true: One of these situations applies to you: you have a recommendation from a provider requesting Medically Necessary Services you have received Emergency Services, emergency ambulance Services, or Urgent Care from a provider who determined the Services to be Medically Necessary you have been seen by a Plan Provider for the diagnosis or treatment of your medical condition Your request for payment or Services has been denied, modified, or delayed based in whole or in part on a decision that the Services are not Medically Necessary You have filed a grievance and we have denied it or we haven't made a decision about your grievance within 30 days (or three days for urgent grievances). The DMHC may waive the requirement that you first file a grievance with us in extraordinary and compelling cases, such as severe pain or potential loss of life, limb, or major bodily function. If we have denied your grievance, you must submit your request for an IMR within six months of the date of our written denial. However, the DMHC may accept your request after six months if they determine that circumstances prevented timely submission You may also qualify for IMR if the Service you requested has been denied on the basis that it is experimental or investigational as described under \"Experimental or investigational denials.\" If the DMHC determines that your case is eligible for IMR, it will ask us to send your case to the DMHC's IMR organization. The DMHC will promptly notify you of its decision after it receives the IMR organization's determination. If the decision is in your favor, we will contact you to arrange for the Service or payment. Experimental or investigational denials If we deny a Service because it is experimental or investigational, we will send you our written explanation within three days after we received your request. We will explain why we denied the Service and provide additional dispute resolution options. Also, we will provide information about your right to request Independent Medical Review if we had the following information when we made our decision: Your treating physician provided us a written statement that you have a life-threatening or seriously debilitating condition and that standard therapies have not been effective in improving your condition, or that standard therapies would not be appropriate, or that there is no more beneficial standard therapy we cover than the therapy being requested. \"Life- threatening\" means diseases or conditions where the likelihood of death is high unless the course of the disease is interrupted, or diseases or conditions with potentially fatal outcomes where the end point of clinical intervention is survival. \"Seriously debilitating\" means diseases or conditions that cause major irreversible morbidity If your treating physician is a Plan Physician, they recommended a treatment, drug, device, procedure, or other therapy and certified that the requested therapy is likely to be more beneficial to you than any available standard therapies and included a statement of the evidence relied upon by the Plan Physician in certifying their recommendation You (or your Non-Plan Physician who is a licensed, and either a board-certified or board-eligible, physician qualified in the area of practice appropriate to treat your condition) requested a therapy that, based on two documents from the medical and scientific evidence, as defined in California Health and Safety Code Section 1370.4(d), is likely to be more beneficial for you than any available standard therapy. The physician's certification included a statement of the evidence relied upon by the physician in certifying their recommendation. We do not cover the Services of the Non-Plan Provider Note: You can request IMR for experimental or investigational denials at any time without first filing a grievance with us. Office of Civil Rights Complaints If you believe that you have been discriminated against by a Plan Provider or by us because of your race, color, national origin, disability, age, sex (including sex stereotyping and gender identity), or religion, you may file a complaint with the Office of Civil Rights in the United States Department of Health and Human Services (\"OCR\").

Additional Review You may have certain additional rights if you remain dissatisfied after you have exhausted our internal claims and appeals procedure, and if applicable, external review: If your Group's benefit plan is subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\"ERISA\"), you may file a civil action under section 502(a) of ERISA. To understand these rights, you should check with your Group or contact the Employee Benefits Security Administration (part of the U.S. Department of Labor) at 1-866-444-EBSA (1-866-444-3272) If your Group's benefit plan is not subject to ERISA (for example, most state or local government plans and church plans), you may have a right to request review in state court Binding Arbitration For all claims subject to this \"Binding Arbitration\" section, both Claimants and Respondents give up the right to a jury or court trial and accept the use of binding arbitration. Insofar as this \"Binding Arbitration\" section applies to claims asserted by Kaiser Permanente Parties, it shall apply retroactively to all unresolved claims that accrued before the effective date of this EOC. Such retroactive application shall be binding only on the Kaiser Permanente Parties. Scope of arbitration Any dispute shall be submitted to binding arbitration if all of the following requirements are met: The claim arises from or is related to an alleged violation of any duty incident to or arising out of or relating to this EOC or a Member Party's relationship to Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc. (\"Health Plan\"), including any claim for medical or hospital malpractice (a claim that medical services or items were unnecessary or unauthorized or were improperly, negligently, or incompetently rendered), for premises liability, or relating to the coverage for, or delivery of, services or items, irrespective of the legal theories upon which the claim is asserted The claim is asserted by one or more Member Parties against one or more Kaiser Permanente Parties or by one or more Kaiser Permanente Parties against one or more Member Parties Governing law does not prevent the use of binding arbitration to resolve the claim Members enrolled under this EOC thus give up their right to a court or jury trial, and instead accept the use of binding arbitration except that the following types of claims are not subject to binding arbitration: Claims within the jurisdiction of the Small Claims Court Claims subject to a Medicare appeal procedure as applicable to Kaiser Permanente Senior Advantage Members Claims that cannot be subject to binding arbitration under governing law As referred to in this \"Binding Arbitration\" section, \"Member Parties\" include: A Member A Member's heir, relative, or personal representative Any person claiming that a duty to them arises from a Member's relationship to one or more Kaiser Permanente Parties \"Kaiser Permanente Parties\" include: Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc. Kaiser Foundation Hospitals The Permanente Medical Group, Inc. Southern California Permanente Medical Group The Permanente Federation, LLC The Permanente Company, LLC Any Southern California Permanente Medical Group or The Permanente Medical Group physician Any individual or organization whose contract with any of the organizations identified above requires arbitration of claims brought by one or more Member Parties Any employee or agent of any of the foregoing \"Claimant\" refers to a Member Party or a Kaiser Permanente Party who asserts a claim as described above. \"Respondent\" refers to a Member Party or a Kaiser Permanente Party against whom a claim is asserted. Rules of Procedure Arbitrations shall be conducted according to the Rules for Kaiser Permanente Member Arbitrations Overseen by the Office of the Independent Administrator (\"Rules of Procedure\") developed by the Office of the Independent Administrator in consultation with Kaiser Sample Group ID: {PID} Kaiser Permanente 2022 Page 76 Permanente and the Arbitration Oversight Board. Copies of the Rules of Procedure may be obtained from Member Services. Initiating arbitration Claimants shall initiate arbitration by serving a Demand for Arbitration. The Demand for Arbitration shall include the basis of the claim against the Respondents; the amount of damages the Claimants seek in the arbitration; the names, addresses, and phone numbers of the Claimants and their attorney, if any; and the names of all Respondents. Claimants shall include in the Demand for Arbitration all claims against Respondents that are based on the same incident, transaction, or related circumstances. Serving Demand for Arbitration Health Plan, Kaiser Foundation Hospitals, The Permanente Medical Group, Inc., Southern California Permanente Medical Group, The Permanente Federation, LLC, and The Permanente Company, LLC, shall be served with a Demand for Arbitration by mailing the Demand for Arbitration addressed to that Respondent in care of: Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc. Legal Department 1950 Franklin St., 17th Floor Oakland, CA 94612 Service on that Respondent shall be deemed completed when received. All other Respondents, including individuals, must be served as required by the California Code of Civil Procedure for a civil action. Filing fee The Claimants shall pay a single, nonrefundable filing fee of $150 per arbitration payable to \"Arbitration Account\" regardless of the number of claims asserted in the Demand for Arbitration or the number of Claimants or Respondents named in the Demand for Arbitration. Any Claimant who claims extreme hardship may request that the Office of the Independent Administrator waive the filing fee and the neutral arbitrator's fees and expenses. A Claimant who seeks such waivers shall complete the Fee Waiver Form and submit it to the Office of the Independent Administrator and simultaneously serve it upon the Respondents. The Fee Waiver Form sets forth the criteria for waiving fees and is available by calling Member Services. Number of arbitrators The number of arbitrators may affect the Claimants' responsibility for paying the neutral arbitrator's fees and expenses (see the Rules of Procedure). If the Demand for Arbitration seeks total damages of $200,000 or less, the dispute shall be heard and determined by one neutral arbitrator, unless the parties otherwise agree in writing after a dispute has arisen and a request for binding arbitration has been submitted that the arbitration shall be heard by two party arbitrators and one neutral arbitrator. The neutral arbitrator shall not have authority to award monetary damages that are greater than $200,000. If the Demand for Arbitration seeks total damages of more than $200,000, the dispute shall be heard and determined by one neutral arbitrator and two party arbitrators, one jointly appointed by all Claimants and one jointly appointed by all Respondents. Parties who are entitled to select a party arbitrator may agree to waive this right. If all parties agree, these arbitrations will be heard by a single neutral arbitrator. Payment of arbitrators' fees and expenses Health Plan will pay the fees and expenses of the neutral arbitrator under certain conditions as set forth in the Rules of Procedure. In all other arbitrations, the fees and expenses of the neutral arbitrator shall be paid one-half by the Claimants and one-half by the Respondents. If the parties select party arbitrators, Claimants shall be responsible for paying the fees and expenses of their party arbitrator and Respondents shall be responsible for paying the fees and expenses of their party arbitrator. Costs Except for the aforementioned fees and expenses of the neutral arbitrator, and except as otherwise mandated by laws that apply to arbitrations under this \"Binding Arbitration\" section, each party shall bear the party's own attorneys' fees, witness fees, and other expenses incurred in prosecuting or defending against a claim regardless of the nature of the claim or outcome of the arbitration. General provisions A claim shall be waived and forever barred if (1) on the date the Demand for Arbitration of the claim is served, the claim, if asserted in a civil action, would be barred as to the Respondent served by the applicable statute of limitations, (2) Claimants fail to pursue the arbitration claim in accord with the Rules of Procedure with reasonable diligence, or (3) the arbitration hearing is not commenced within five years after the earlier of (a) the date the Demand for Arbitration was served in accord with the procedures prescribed herein, or (b) the date of filing of a civil action based upon the same incident, transaction, or related circumstances involved in the claim. A claim may be dismissed on other grounds by the Sample Group ID: {PID} Kaiser Permanente 2022 Page 77 neutral arbitrator based on a showing of a good cause. If a party fails to attend the arbitration hearing after being given due notice thereof, the neutral arbitrator may proceed to determine the controversy in the party's absence. The California Medical Injury Compensation Reform Act of 1975 (including any amendments thereto), including sections establishing the right to introduce evidence of any insurance or disability benefit payment to the patient, the limitation on recovery for non- economic losses, and the right to have an award for future damages conformed to periodic payments, shall apply to any claims for professional negligence or any other claims as permitted or required by law. Arbitrations shall be governed by this \"Binding Arbitration\" section, Section 2 of the Federal Arbitration Act, and the California Code of Civil Procedure provisions relating to arbitration that are in effect at the time the statute is applied, together with the Rules of Procedure, to the extent not inconsistent with this \"Binding Arbitration\" section. In accord with the rule that applies under Sections 3 and 4 of the Federal Arbitration Act, the right to arbitration under this \"Binding Arbitration\" section shall not be denied, stayed, or otherwise impeded because a dispute between a Member Party and a Kaiser Permanente Party involves both arbitrable and nonarbitrable claims or because one or more parties to the arbitration is also a party to a pending court action with another party that arises out of the same or related transactions and presents a possibility of conflicting rulings or findings. Termination of Membership Your Group is required to inform the Subscriber of the date your membership terminates. Your membership termination date is the first day you are not covered (for example, if your termination date is January 1, 2024, your last minute of coverage was at 11:59 p.m. on December 31, 2023). When a Subscriber's membership ends, the memberships of any Dependents end at the same time. You will be billed as a non-Member for any Services you receive after your membership terminates. Health Plan and Plan Providers have no further liability or responsibility under this EOC after your membership terminates, except as provided under \"Payments after Termination\" in this \"Termination of Membership\" section. Termination Due to Loss of Eligibility If you no longer meet the eligibility requirements described under \"Who Is Eligible\" in the \"Premiums, Eligibility, and Enrollment\" section, your Group will notify you of the date that your membership will end. Your membership termination date is the first day you are not covered. For example, if your termination date is January 1, 2024, your last minute of coverage was at 11:59 p.m. on December 31, 2023. Termination of Agreement If your Group's Agreement with us terminates for any reason, your membership ends on the same date. Your Group is required to notify Subscribers in writing if its Agreement with us terminates. Termination for Cause If you intentionally commit fraud in connection with membership, Health Plan, or a Plan Provider, we may terminate your membership by sending written notice to the Subscriber; termination will be effective 30 days from the date we send the notice. Some examples of fraud include: Misrepresenting eligibility information about you or a Dependent Presenting an invalid prescription or physician order Misusing a Kaiser Permanente ID card (or letting someone else use it) Giving us incorrect or incomplete material information. For example, you have entered into a Surrogacy Arrangement and you fail to send us the information we require under \"Surrogacy Arrangements\" under \"Reductions\" in the \"Exclusions, Limitations, Coordination of Benefits, and Reductions\" section Failing to notify us of changes in family status or Medicare coverage that may affect your eligibility or benefits If we terminate your membership for cause, you will not be allowed to enroll in Health Plan in the future. We may also report criminal fraud and other illegal acts to the authorities for prosecution. Termination of a Product or all Products We may terminate a particular product or all products offered in the group market as permitted or required by law. If we discontinue offering a particular product in the Sample Group ID: {PID} Kaiser Permanente 2022 Page 78 group market, we will terminate just the particular product by sending you written notice at least 90 days before the product terminates. If we discontinue offering all products in the group market, we may terminate your Group's Agreement by sending you written notice at least 180 days before the Agreement terminates. Payments after Termination If we terminate your membership for cause or for nonpayment, we will: Refund any amounts we owe your Group for Premiums paid after the termination date Pay you any amounts we have determined that we owe you for claims during your membership in accord with the \"Emergency Services and Urgent Care\" and \"Dispute Resolution\" sections We will deduct any amounts you owe Health Plan or Plan Providers from any payment we make to you. State Review of Membership Termination If you believe that we have terminated your membership because of your ill health or your need for care, you may request a review of the termination by the California Department of Managed Health Care (please see \"Department of Managed Health Care Complaints\" in the \"Dispute Resolution\" section). Continuation of Membership If your membership under this EOC ends, you may be eligible to continue Health Plan membership without a break in coverage. You may be able to continue Group coverage under this EOC as described under \"Continuation of Group Coverage.\" Also, you may be able to continue membership under an individual plan as described under \"Continuation of Coverage under an Individual Plan.\" If at any time you become entitled to continuation of Group coverage, please examine your coverage options carefully before declining this coverage. Individual plan premiums and coverage will be different from the premiums and coverage under your Group plan. Continuation of Group Coverage COBRA You may be able to continue your coverage under this EOC for a limited time after you would otherwise lose eligibility, if required by the federal Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (\"COBRA\"). COBRA applies to most employees (and most of their covered family Dependents) of most employers with 20 or more employees. If your Group is subject to COBRA and you are eligible for COBRA coverage, in order to enroll you must submit a COBRA election form to your Group within the COBRA election period. Please ask your Group for details about COBRA coverage, such as how to elect coverage, how much you must pay for coverage, when coverage and Premiums may change, and where to send your Premium payments. If you enroll in COBRA and exhaust the time limit for COBRA coverage, you may be able to continue Group coverage under state law as described under \"Cal- COBRA\" in this \"Continuation of Group Coverage\" section. Cal-COBRA If you are eligible for coverage under the California Continuation Benefits Replacement Act (\"Cal- COBRA\"), you can continue coverage as described in this \"Cal-COBRA\" section if you apply for coverage in compliance with Cal-COBRA law and pay applicable Premiums. Eligibility and effective date of coverage for Cal- COBRA after COBRA If your group is subject to COBRA and your COBRA coverage ends, you may be able to continue Group coverage effective the date your COBRA coverage ends if all of the following are true: Your effective date of COBRA coverage was on or after January 1, 2003 You have exhausted the time limit for COBRA coverage and that time limit was 18 or 29 months You do not have Medicare You must request an enrollment application by calling Member Services within 60 days of the date of when your COBRA coverage ends. Cal-COBRA enrollment and Premiums Within 10 days of your request for an enrollment application, we will send you our application, which will include Premium and billing information. You must Sample Group ID: {PID} Kaiser Permanente 2022 Page 79 return your completed application within 63 days of the date of our termination letter or of your membership termination date (whichever date is later). If we approve your enrollment application, we will send you billing information within 30 days after we receive your application. You must pay Full Premiums within 45 days after the date we issue the bill. The first Premium payment will include coverage from your Cal-COBRA effective date through our current billing cycle. You must send us the Premium payment by the due date on the bill to be enrolled in Cal-COBRA. After that first payment, your Premium payment for the upcoming coverage month is due on first day of that month. The Premiums will not exceed 110 percent of the applicable Premiums charged to a similarly situated individual under the Group benefit plan except that Premiums for disabled individuals after 18 months of COBRA coverage will not exceed 150 percent instead of 110 percent. Returned checks or insufficient funds on electronic payments will be subject to a $25 fee. If you have selected Ancillary Coverage provided under any other program, the Premium for that Ancillary Coverage will be billed together with required Premiums for coverage under this EOC. Full Premiums will then also include Premium for Ancillary Coverage. This means if you do not pay the Full Premiums owed by the due date, we may terminate your membership under this EOC and any Ancillary Coverage, as described in the \"Termination for nonpayment of Cal-COBRA Premiums\" section. Changes to Cal-COBRA coverage and Premiums Your Cal-COBRA coverage is the same as for any similarly situated individual under your Group's Agreement , and your Cal-COBRA coverage and Premiums will change at the same time that coverage or Premiums change in your Group's Agreement. Your Group's coverage and Premiums will change on the renewal date of its Agreement (January 1), and may also change at other times if your Group's Agreement is amended. Your monthly invoice will reflect the current Premiums that are due for Cal-COBRA coverage, including any changes. For example, if your Group makes a change that affects Premiums retroactively, the amount we bill you will be adjusted to reflect the retroactive adjustment in Premiums. Your Group can tell you whether this EOC is still in effect and give you a current one if this EOC has expired or been amended. You can also request one from Member Services. Cal-COBRA open enrollment or termination of another health plan If you previously elected Cal-COBRA coverage through another health plan available through your Group, you may be eligible to enroll in Kaiser Permanente during your Group's annual open enrollment period, or if your Group terminates its agreement with the health plan you are enrolled in. You will be entitled to Cal-COBRA coverage only for the remainder, if any, of the coverage period prescribed by Cal-COBRA. Please ask your Group for information about health plans available to you either at open enrollment or if your Group terminates a health plan's agreement. In order for you to switch from another health plan and continue your Cal-COBRA coverage with us, we must receive your enrollment application during your Group's open enrollment period, or within 63 days of receiving the Group's termination notice described under \"Group responsibilities.\" To request an application, please call Member Services.

You will have a 30-day grace period to pay the required Premiums before we terminate your Cal- COBRA coverage for nonpayment. The notice will state when the grace period begins and when the memberships of the Subscriber and all Dependents will terminate if the required Premiums are not paid. Your coverage will continue during this grace period. If we do not receive Full Premium payment by the end of the grace period, we will mail a termination notice to the Subscriber's address of record. After termination of your membership for nonpayment of Cal-COBRA Premiums, you are still responsible for paying all amounts due, including Premiums for the grace period. Reinstatement of your membership after termination for nonpayment of Cal-COBRA Premiums If we terminate your membership for nonpayment of Premiums, we will permit reinstatement of your membership three times during any 12-month period if we receive the amounts owed within 15 days of the date of the Termination Notice.

Also, if Social Security issues a final determination that you are no longer disabled in the 35th or 36th month of Group continuation coverage, your Cal- COBRA coverage will end the later of: (1) expiration of 36 months after your original COBRA effective date, or (2) the first day of the first month following 31 days after Social Security issued its final determination. You must notify us within 30 days after you receive Social Security's final determination that you are no longer disabled.

However, Federal law generally does not prohibit the mother's or newborn's attending provider, after consulting with the mother, from discharging the mother or her newborn earlier than 48 hours (or 96 hours as applicable). In any case, plans and issuers may not, under Federal law, require that a provider obtain authorization from the plan or the insurance issuer for prescribing a length of stay not in excess of 48 hours (or 96 hours).
