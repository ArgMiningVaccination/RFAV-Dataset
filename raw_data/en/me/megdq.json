Rosenberg Clinical Cancer CenterThe Year in Review COMMUNITY NETWORK The Cancer Center's community network includes two direct (owned) members and three that are independent, seamlessly integrated affiliates. Each community program offers multidisciplinary care where it is most convenient for patients and makes referrals to BIDMC for advanced care when needed. Tumor boards and breast conferences between affiliates and BIDMC colleagues are held regularly by videoconference, with participation by radiation oncologists, medical oncologists, cancer surgeons, oncology nursing, pathologists, radiologists and other specialists. Affiliates include: Lank Cancer Center at Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital-Needham Lank Cancer Center, an integral part of the BIDMC Cancer Center located at Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital-Needham, is home to advanced diagnostics and therapies, and compassionate, team- based care. Its medical staff provides highly attentive, personalized care, and consists of the same Harvard-affiliated physicians who practice at the BIDMC Cancer Center in Boston. The new, 30,000 square foot facility spans three floors and is adjacent to Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital-Needham. All cancer care services are on the first floor, including radiation treatment. Services and facilities include a radiation oncology suite with a state-of-the-art linear accelerator that delivers advanced conformal radiation therapy; advanced imaging systems; 10 chemotherapy bays, a private chemotherapy room and multiple exam rooms; and a patient-friendly environment with a healing garden and plenty of natural light. The Beth Israel Deaconess Cancer Center in Needham was named \"Lank Cancer Center\" in recognition of the generosity of Althea and Buddy Lank, members of a family, who have supported BIDMC and Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital over many decades. Cambridge Health Alliance Cancer Care CHA oncologists are experts in the evaluation and treatment of cancer and blood disorders (hematology). They coordinate with colleagues in surgery, pathology, radiology and other disciplines and work closely with BIDMC for complex health needs. Services are available at CHA Cambridge Hospital and CHA Everett Hospital. Cancer Center at Anna Jaques Hospital The program, which affiliated with BIDMC in 2015, has grown substantially. To support patients, family members and care givers, a number of programs and services have been implemented including a distress screening tool, a bereavement support group and a part time social worker. Partnering with the AJH radiology department, a lung cancer screening program began in 2016. A compassionate and determined group of women created a website and centralized resources so that patients have access to integrative therapies. To alleviate stress during infusion treatments, Reiki massage and yoga are offered to patients and their significant others. The Greene Cancer Center at Signature Healthcare Signature Healthcare/Brockton Hospital joined the BIDMC family in 2016. The collaboration brings comprehensive cancer care to Signature Healthcare/Brockton Hospital and provides Southeast 2016 Annual Report8 Leon V. & Marilyn L. Rosenberg Clinical Cancer CenterMassachusetts patients a full range of cancer services supported by BIDMC's advanced cancer treatment strategies and research. Medical oncology including chemotherapy has been added to Signature Healthcare's existing early detection, radiation oncology, genetic counseling, social work and palliative care services. The formation of a separate Medical Oncology Division has greatly facilitated patient care. Growth has been rapid with providers evaluating over 1,000 new patients with cancers and hematologic problems in the first year of operation. Medical Oncology providers aim to provide next business day consultations for patients with a new diagnosis of cancer. All of the required services are now in place and operating in a coordinated manner in preparation for a move in the fall of 2017 to a new facility where all cancer services will be delivered under one roof. The Jordan Hospital Club Cancer Center at BID-Plymouth The Jordan Hospital Club Cancer Center at BID-Plymouth provides complete cancer care for all disease types. It offers a full range of community cancer services of early detection, high risk screening and diagnosis, and the latest treatment regimens in medical and radiation oncology. BID-Plymouth participates in both NCI-sponsored cancer clinical trials, through an affiliate membership with ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group, and non-network group trials. In 2016, the program experienced an increase of over 700 patients diagnosed and/or treated in the cancer center and breast center. BID-Plymouth maintains a constant presence in the community, including a Cancer Survivor Day in June enjoyed by over 450 patients and families. CLINICAL ADVANCES AND NEW SERVICES Plastic Surgery Techniques Enhance Quality of Life The BreastCare Center introduced a concealed-scar surgical technique that significantly minimizes visible scar tissue after mastectomy and lumpectomy. Plastic surgeons who specialize in the care of cancer patients with lymphedema also began offering surgical treatments to prevent or ease lymphedema, a condition that causes uncomfortable swelling in the arms that can result from breast surgery or radiation therapy. Linsey BreastCare Center Opens The Joseph M. and Thelma Linsey BreastCare Center opened at BIDMC after extensive renovation. The Center's design was developed through empirical studies and input from patients about their experiences and expectations. Studies have shown that the \"patient experience\" can have an impact on clinical outcomes and post-treatment quality of life, either positive or negative. To that end, the Linsey BreastCare Center comprises two floors, one for breast screening and the other for surgical consultations. With nature-themed, light-filled interiors, surgical consultation rooms offer a calm and comforting environment. The new nurse navigator acts as the point person for patients as they move through the pre-, during-, and post-treatment process. In addition, the nurse navigator works with the physicians to understand the multicultural needs of patients who come from around the world for care. 2016 Annual Report9 Leon V. & Marilyn L.

The American College of Surgeons is dedicated to enhancing surgical care for patients, while safeguarding and implementing optimal and ethical standards of care. RESEARCH PROGRAMS Cancer Vaccine Improves Outcomes for AML Patients A personalized cancer vaccine markedly improved outcomes for patients suffering from acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a potentially lethal blood cancer, in a clinical trial led by investigators at the Cancer Center at BIDMC. The study published in Science Translational Medicine was the product of a long-term collaboration among investigators at BIDMC and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. The vaccine stimulated powerful immune responses against AML cells and resulted in protection from relapse in a majority of patients. Despite an average age of 63, more than 70 percent of trial participants remained in remission at an average follow-up period of more than four years. The lead author of the paper was Jacalyn Rosenblatt, MD, Co-Director of the Cancer Vaccine Program at the BIDMC Cancer Center. The senior author was David Avigan, MD, Chief, Section of Hematological Malignancies and Director of the Cancer Vaccine Program. Research Reveals the Importance of Long Non-Coding RNA Regulating Cellular Processes Scientific research over the past decade has concentrated almost exclusively on the 2 percent of the genome's protein coding regions, virtually ignoring the other 98 percent, a vast universe of non-coding genetic material previously dismissed as nothing more than \"junk.\" However, one type - called long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) - may be critically important for controlling cellular components in a tissue-specific manner. Long non-coding RNAs appear to be transcribed from our DNA in a similar manner to coding messenger RNAs but are not translated into proteins. While lncRNA molecules do not produce correspondingly lengthy proteins, researchers have wondered whether some of these molecules may contain segments of sequences that can code for very short proteins, or polypeptides. Under the leadership of Pier Paolo Pandolfi, MD, PhD, Director of the Cancer Center and Cancer Research Institute at BIDMC, his team found that the SPAR encoding lncRNA is highly expressed in a number of tissue types, including muscle. Experiments conducted in mice demonstrated that through its effects on mTORC1, the SPAR polypeptide helps regulate the muscle's ability to regenerate and repair after injury. Specifically, expression of LINC00961 is blocked following muscle injury in mice, leading to reduced levels of SPAR and maximal mTORC1 activity to promote tissue regeneration. 2016 Annual Report11 Leon V. & Marilyn L. Rosenberg Clinical Cancer CenterThe results suggest that lncRNAs may have diverse roles and functions. Although they may not code for large proteins, lncRNAs may produce small polypeptides that can fine tune the activity of critical cellular components. The findings also expand the repertoire of peptide-coding genes in the human genome that should be studied and annotated. The research was first published online in Nature. Five Gene Classifier Offers Potential for Early Pancreatic Cancer Diagnosis Pancreatic cancer, the fourth leading cause of cancer death in the United States, is often diagnosed at a late stage, when curative treatment is no longer possible. A team led by Manoj Bhasin, PhD, and Towia Libermann, PhD, Co-Director and Director of BIDMC's Genomics, Proteomics, Bioinformatics and Systems Biology Center, identified and validated an accurate five-gene classifier for discriminating early pancreatic cancer from non-malignant tissue. The investigators used a number of publicly available gene expression datasets for pancreatic cancer and developed a strategy to reanalyze these datasets together, applying rigorous statistical criteria to compare different datasets from different laboratories and different platforms with each other. The team then selected a subset of data for developing a panel for differentiating between pancreatic cancer and healthy pancreas tissue and thereafter applied this \"pancreatic cancer predictor\" to the remaining datasets for independent validation to confirm the accuracy of the markers. The scientists' next project is to evaluate the precise roles of the five genes and to validate the accuracy of their diagnostic assay in a prospective clinical study. \"Moving forward, we will explore the potential to convert this tissue-based diagnostic into a noninvasive blood or urine test,\" Libermann said. He is a promising advance in the fight against this typically fatal disease. JAX-BIDMC Partnership Targets Triple Negative Breast Cancers The United States Army Medical Research and Materiel Command awarded $1.8 million over three years to Edison Liu, MD, President and CEO of The Jackson Laboratory, and Ralph Scully, PhD, a BIDMC cancer researcher. The grant will support studies aimed at characterizing the molecular basis of triple-negative breast cancers. The investigators hope their collaboration will result in the identification of a biomarker that can predict clinical response to cisplatin and other existing and new drugs used to treat triple-negative breast cancer and related ovarian and endometrial cancers. Researchers Inhibit Tumor Growth in New Subtype of Lung Cancer A team of investigators led by Elena Levantini, PhD, a research associate in Hematology-Oncology at BIDMC, an instructor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and a member of the Harvard Stem Cell Institute, have identified a subtype of human adenocarcinoma. The research could help determine which individuals are at greatest risk of developing lung tumors that may be amenable to a new therapy to inhibit their progression. The results - done in collaboration with the Cancer Science Institute at the National University of Singapore (CSI NUS) - were published in the journal Science Translational Medicine. PROGRAMS AND PUBLICATIONS RNAMEDICINE2016 The second annual symposium of the BIDMC Cancer Center's Institute for RNA Medicine (iRM), brought together 12 of the field's most prominent scientists for a day of illuminating presentations, provocative questions and discussion. Presentations focused on how this once-mysterious genetic material cuts across all aspects of Manoj Bhasin, PhD, and co-senior author Towia Libermann, PhD2016 Annual Report12 Leon V. & Marilyn L. Rosenberg Clinical Cancer Centerbiomedical science and disease areas, notably cancer, but also metabolic diseases, neurological conditions and some of public health's most pressing diseases. Sequencing of the human genome made possible the discovery that non-coding RNAs are not junk, but number in the tens of thousands - and the list is not yet complete. Hosted by Frank Slack, PhD, iRM Director, and Jeffrey Saffitz, MD, PhD, Chair, Pathology, and iRM co-founder, the event also brought news that the iRM will soon be expanding beyond the walls of BIDMC to become a Harvard Medical School Initiative, which will leverage the experience and expertise of the greater Harvard community. At RNAMEDICINE2016, Cancer Center Director and iRM co-founder Pier Paolo Pandolfi, MD, PhD, introduced his recently published work describing fusion circular RNAs, genes that can act as non-coding RNAs and serve key functions in tumorigenesis and therapy resistance. He further described the iRM's pursuit of \"ultra-precision medicine,\" which makes use of both genomic and non-coding RNA discoveries in the pursuit of new drugs and therapies. NINTH ANNUAL CANCER SYMPOSIUM \"Pathways to Cure,\" the ninth annual Cancer Symposium at BIDMC hosted by Pier Paolo Pandolfi, MD, PhD, Director of the Cancer Center at BIDMC, focused on trail-blazing advances in cancer research that translate into cancer genomics and immunotherapies that can result in cures. A brief history of the development of cancer immunotherapy drugs, first approved by the FDA in 1992, provided the backdrop for other presentations and discussions. While these first immunotherapies produced a durable remission for a certain subset of patients, they were toxic and didn't work for most people. Since then, researchers have developed newer immunotherapies that are more tolerable and apply to a number of different kinds of tumors, including kidney, lung, melanoma and bladder cancers. Urologic Robotic Surgical Training BIDMC is one of three institutions in the United States to offer urologic robotic surgical training. The course, directed by Andrew Wagner, MD, with urologic surgeons Peter Chang, MD, and Peter Steinberg, MD, provides training in a unique two-day program that includes a moderated live case, didactic and hands-on instruction in the latest approaches to safe and reproducible robotic kidney, prostate and bladder surgery. Incubator Hatches Collaborations Physician-scientist Rebecca Miksad, MD, MPH, spearheaded an initiative that resulted in collaborative research proposals aimed at one of the deadliest cancers in Massachusetts: liver cancer. Dr. Miksad serves as a chair of a Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center (a coalition of the Harvard teaching hospitals) Steering Committee that organized a cross-institutional Liver Cancer Grant Incubator program at which nearly 50 scientists and physicians discussed all aspects of liver cancer to \"hatch ideas\" for grant proposals. As a result, a number of novel proposals and collaborations emerged. First Textbook on Tumor Treating Fields for Brain Cancer Director of the Neuro-Oncology Unit and Co-Director of the Brain Tumor Program, Eric T. Wong, MD, published the first textbook on Tumor Treating Fields in oncology, one of only two treatments (the other is stereotactic radiosurgery) that originated in neuro-oncology and is being applied to other diseases. Edited by Wong, Symposium Speakers2016 Annual Report13 Leon V. & Marilyn L. Rosenberg Clinical Cancer CenterAlternating Electric Fields Therapy in Oncology: A Practical Guide to Clinical Applications of Tumor Treating Fields presents a new technology for the treatment of glioblastomas using electromagnetic therapy. TTFields therapy has extended median survival by five months and can stabilize a glioblastoma, a common, aggressive and difficult cancer to treat for as much as two years. There is growing evidence that TTFields may be applicable to lung, ovarian, pancreatic and other tumors.

In addition, the Cancer Center conducted a full complement of programs designed to support patients in underserved communities. Many of the activities were undertaken in conjunction with the American Cancer Society (ACS). Patient Navigator Program The collaboration between BIDMC and the ACS has provided patient navigator services to BIDMC patients and families for more than five years and is an integral part of BIDMC's overall patient navigation program. A Chinese-speaking patient navigator has been supported by BIDMC and a Spanish- speaking navigator has been supported through an ACS grant. The top five identified disease types served by the Patient Navigator Program are shown below. Combined, these patients made 208 requests for supportive services accounting for 44% of all requests out of a total of 494 requests for all disease types.Patient Navigator Program The program serves a racially and culturally diverse population. During 2016, 1,068 patients met one-on-one with a patient navigator to connect them with programs and services. 2% 6 Medicaid +Medicare17 Medicare +Private71 PrivateWhile 300 patients did not indicate insurance coverage type, information on 167 was obtained. Of those, only one indicated no insurance. 1 No Insurance 2 Other2016 Annual Report16 Leon V. & Marilyn L. Rosenberg Clinical Cancer CenterIn addition to helping individual patients, the navigators support a number of psychosocial programs. Patients are offered opportunities to participate in appropriate programs such as Reach to Recovery, a program that matches newly diagnosed breast cancer patients with breast cancer survivors; Man to Man, the prostate cancer support program; Road to Recovery, information about transportation and Look Good Feel Better, personal care workshops. A multicultural cancer support group organized by BIDMC is held at the Society's AstraZeneca Hope Lodge in Boston. Psychosocial Programs Psychosocial programs available in Spanish and Chinese include a Latina breast cancer support group held at BIDMC and Tea Time, a program for women in the Chinese community who are receiving treatment or are survivors of cancer. Information for local Relay for Life Survivorship Celebrations is provided via bulletin boards and through conversations with the patient navigator. Educational sessions were provided by five physicians from BIDMC at the 19th Annual Massachusetts Prostate Cancer Symposium. The brochure Is a Clinical Trial The Right Choice For Me? is available in waiting areas and from the patient navigator. Nutrition for the Person with Cancer during Treatment: A Guide for Patients and Families is available for patients from the patient navigator. I Can Cope nutrition information is available online, for patients/caregivers with access to the internet. American Cancer Society brochures in several languages are available in outpatient clinics, in Radiation Planning, in the BreastCare Center and on in-patient units. We continue our partnership with BIDMC's Human Subject Protection Office (HSPO) to provide a quarterly educational program titled Truly Consenting Adults. The interactive presentations, targeting both clinicians and researchers incorporate principles of providing health literacy and cultural/linguistic considerations in the informed consent process.2016 Annual Report17 Leon V. & Marilyn L.

Rosenberg Clinical Cancer Center A Quality Improvement Initiative to improve procedural safety in Hematology Oncology: Methods and Lessons Adebayo Oshin, Alex Carbo, MD; Stephen Cannistra, MD Department of Medicine and Division of Hematology and Oncology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center INTRODUCTION During a procedure defined as invasive (involving puncture or incision of the skin, or the insertion of an instrument or foreign material into the body) that exposes a patient to more than a minimal risk of a significant complication, a timeout should be conducted and documented . The use of a pre -procedure checklist greatly helps prevent wrong site, wrong procedure and wrong person procedures and thus minimizes patient harm and distress. Although there are standardized steps for documenting a timeout in the outpatient clinics and inpatient areas, these were not consistently followed . ASSESSING PERFORMANCE AND MEASURES OF SUCCESS OBJECTIVES We generated a report of invasive procedures identified by billing records and reviewed with QI leaders to ensure all procedures were captured and corresponding documentation included a pre -procedure checklist. Billing reports were run monthly to identify invasive procedures performed in ambulatory and inpatient settings and medical record audits of documentation of a pre -procedural time -out were conducted. Rates were reported and reviewed by the QI Leadership. Our interventions included generating monthly reports of rates of documentation of procedural time -outs and having QI Leadership discussing the importance of the data with providers. In addition, we reminded providers of macros developed for procedural notes which included documentation of time -out and we sent individualized emails to notify any provider who did not document a time -out when performing an invasive procedure. We set a target that 100 % of invasive procedures done in Hematology Oncology would have a time -out documented. An audit of the online medical record was performed and rates of documentation of time out were measured and tracked . INTERVENTION, INCLUDING CONTEXT To identify all invasive procedures being performed in Hematology/Oncology outpatient and inpatient areas to ensure consistent, standardized documentation. To establish and improve patient safety during these procedures by properly conducting the pre -procedure checklist and documenting a time -out was performed. The Division of Hematology and Oncology services ambulatory patients on Shapiro 9, Shapiro 7 & Stoneman 7 and inpatients on 11 Reisman , 7 Feldberg and the inpatient consult service. Procedures within the Division are most commonly bone marrow aspirates and biopsies, followed by lumbar punctures. Procedures are most commonly performed in 3 locations: the inpatient heme - malignancy service, inpatient consult service and ambulatory heme -malignancy clinic .

The feedback received by providers via email reports served as a reminder to accurately and properly document timeouts in a timely manner in order to sustain improvements made. We plan to continue tracking the documentation of procedure timeouts and providing feedback for an additional 6 months to ensure sustained improvements.

Rosenberg Clinical Cancer CenterChemotherapy Teaching Initiative For more information, contact: Elizabeth Hammerstrand, NP ehammers@.bidmc.harvard.eduThe Problem It is well established in the nursing literature that patients benefit from an education visit prior to the first session of chemotherapy ; it helps decrease patient anxiety, improves patient understanding, eases time constraints during their f irst chemotherapy , and overall increases nurse and patient satisfaction. When the BIDMC Cancer Center Needham opened in February, 2015, we were not offering these educational visits. We quickly found that the patients were exceedingly anxious and overwhe lmed when they commenced treatment; patients did not have necessary pre -medications, or proper vein assessment both of which resulted in treatment delays. Aim/Goal The goals of the teaching visit are to (1) increase patient knowledge and thus, decrease pa tient anxiety; (2) identify barriers to care and set up necessary multidisciplinary services fro m which the patient may benefit ; (3) ensure preparatory and supportive medications are authorized and obtained; (4) Confirm safe peripheral veins or venous acc ess device in place or set up. We initiated these visits in March, 2015 and collected data through December, 2015. The Team Robb Friedman, MD, Medical Director, Cancer Center Needham Beth Hammerstrand, NP, Nurse Practitioner Linda Yanes, RN, BIDMC, Nurse Coordinator In collaboration with the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center , Cancer Center Needham infusion nurses . The I nterventions Every new patient to the BIDMC Cancer Center Needham who commences with new chemotherapy will have a joint RN/NP teaching v isit to occur at a separate time from an MD visit and prior to the first infusion visit. The Results /Progress to Date Lessons Learned Necessary for physician support to allow nurse schedules to accommodate the teaching visits Patients are willing to come for this appointment if the teaching visit is presented as an expected part of the treatment. Patients endorse great value in the visit It reiterates the multidisciplinary team approach for patients Next Steps Continue to im plement teaching visits with a goal of 100% of patients to receive an education session , including those patients referred from Boston Standardize scheduling templates to include teaching visit as a mandatory visit prior to chemotherapy Standardize documen tation of education al visits as the Cancer Center grows and mor e nurses are involved in visits Implement RN alone teaching sessions as the clinic volume grows and more providers see patients in Needham Consider patient, or nurse satisfaction survey for validation Percentage of Patients who Received Teaching 2016 Annual Report25 Leon V. & Marilyn L. Rosenberg Clinical Cancer CenterSILVERMAN #3 Cytogenetics is Alive and W ell at BIDMC For more information, contact: Tammy Galloway, MT (ASCP), Clinical tgallowa@bidmc.harvard.eduJennifer Tammy Galloway, Judith Jensen, Gina McCormick, MT(ASCP), CG(ASCP), Andrew McCoy, CG(ASCP), Jennifer McFalls, Yigu Che n, MPH. Background The Cytogenetics Laboratory was closed in June of 2013. C hromosome analysis and FISH testing had to be sent out to a reference laboratory creating challenges for both laboratory staff and clinicians. Problems that existed during this t ime included: Interruption of the close communication between Heme/Onc, HemePath, and Cytogenetics necessary for optimal oncology patient care. Consultation regarding an unusual result, additional testing, or management of an unusual specimen is often not easily accomplished when dealing with a large reference lab. Increased turnaround times due to referral to the reference laboratory. Loss of an in -house Cytogenetics rotation for Pathology residents and fellows. Goal Reopen and expand the services of t he Cytogenetics Laboratory as soon as possible, to provide prompt, accurate cytogenetic test results needed for patient care decisions. The I nterventions Obtained approval and support of BIDMC administration to open an expanded full service Cytogenet ics laboratory. Renovated space in the Research West building for the new Cytogenetics laboratory. Recruited highly skilled cytogenetic technologists in chromosome analysis, FISH, microarray, and tissue culture .Inventoried and moved exis ting usable equipment into the new location. Selected and purchased new equipment and supplies . Adapted existing AP SoftPat h laboratory information system for use by Cytogenetics . Performed validation studies for tissue culture, chromosome analysis, microarray and 84 FISH probe sets. Wrote 20 all new standard operating procedures by selecting and combining the best components, methods, and most efficient steps from several Cytogenetics laboratories to maximize quality and minimize cost. Trained and assess edcompetency of new staff. Lessons Learned Starting from scratch was a huge endeavor Provider s'preference to do all ordering via POE/webOMR and do not want to use manual paper requisitions. Next Steps Work with LIS/IS to prioritize the addition of Cy togenetics orders to the webOMR and POE systems. Explore offering Cytogenetics testing beyond BIDMC. Continue to optimize procedures to improve efficiencies and reduce costs where possible. 2016 Annual Report26 Leon V. & Marilyn L. Rosenberg Clinical Cancer CenterSILVERMAN #4 Getting to the Bottom of Things: Lymphatic Drainage Patterns of the Skin in Patients with Melanoma George J. Watts, Quang Nguyen, Elisa Franquet, Kevin J. Donohoe Department of Radiology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical School Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA INTRODUCTION Approximately 40,000 new cases of cutaneous melanoma annually (~7,300 US). Melanoma fi rst disseminates in an orderly progression through lymphatic channels to the regional lymph nodes. Regional lymph node metastatic involvement is the single most important prognostic factor , lowering the 5-year survival rate to approximately 50%. Lymphoscintigraphy has proved reliable in demonstrating variability in cutaneous lymphatic fl ow and identifying the unique drainage pattern . TRACERS An Ideal Tracer should: Have rapid clearance from the in terstitial space into the lymphatic system Produce high-quality images and deliver a low radiation dose to the patient. Small particles (<100 nm diameter) to clear the interstitial space and enter the lymphatic channels and regional nodes Tracers: 99mTc fi scalp melanoma TEACHING POINT: Because LN drainage of the head and neck is highly variable, SPECT/ CT is often useful for accurate localization. In this case, both postauricular and cervical regions are involved. Axial and Coronal SPECT/CTRight neck oblique In-transit nodes represent embryonic rests of lymphatic tissue found along the pathway of a lymphatic channel, occasionally seen between a tumor and the regional lymph node basin In-transit nodes may be the fi rst place for tumor or radionuclide to be trapped and refl ect a true \"sentinel node\" . Intradermal (not injection is recommended. A 25-27-G needle, as tangentially as possible to the skin surface. 0.2 mL volume is recommended to avoid collapsing the lymphatic channels. 0.1-0.2 mL of air is left behind the radiocolloid. Avoid contamination of the skin. Total injected activity ranges from 200 to 1000 Ci, divided into aliquots of 100-250 Ci, in a volume of 0.1-0.5 mL (20). 2- 8 separate injections may be necessary, depending on the excision scar size and are. Avoid infl amed, infected, or scarred areas. Inject 0.5-1.0 cm from the scar or tumor margin. Planar images including the area of injection and regional lymph node basin. Initial large fi eld-of-view (FOV) detector to include injection site to assess for possible fi eld contamination. Dynamic phase imaging with static images obtained approximately every 5 min. for 45-60 minutes. Lateral, oblique views and SPECT/CT to facilitate lymph node visualization over injection site or superimposed lymph nodes. INJECTION IMAGINGPROTOCOL Don't miss these areas!! Head and neck: lateral views for better localization.

Rosenberg Clinical Cancer CenterSILVERMAN #5Hematology/Oncology: Improving Patient flow through Simplified Scheduling , For more information, contact :Chris Rodrigues, Senior Project Manager Office of Improvement and Innovation, i2 cjrodrig@bidmc.harvard.edu.The Problem The Division of Hematology Oncology identified anopportunity to transform the management of provider schedules by leveraging schedule template sin CCC. Historically, providers would spend 1-2 hours week ly reviewing the accuracy of their sche dules .Schedulers would \" hard book\" or manually enter each visit for all appointments ,coordinating a number of patient needs including the coordination of treatment visits and research visits. This creat edan unnecessary administrative burden as well as i ncrease dlikelihood for errors. In addition, patients were being double booked with attending physicians , fellows, and nurse practitioner 's causing bottlenecks in patient flow. Aim/Goal The Gastrointestinal & Hepatobiliary Cancer program requested to pilot an approach to design and manage schedule templates that would decrease the administrative burden ,improve patient flow , and increase patient visits . Primary Measures: Develop standardized appointment types and lengths for physicians, fellows, and nurs e practitioners -including independent nurse practitioner visit types Evaluate and establish RVU and patient volume standards oAttending sessions : 7-8 patients / 10-11 RVU' s per 4 hour session oAttending sessions with fellow and/ or nurse practitioner: 11-12 patients / 14-15 RVU's per 4 hour session Reduce the number of scheduling errors by decreasing physician requested cancelations by 5% (Baseline: on average 200 requests per month for GI) Evaluate and establish a standard for appointment availability Eliminate double booking Secondary Measures: Evaluate patient flow by measuring whether patient visits start on time - patients roomed within 5minut es of scheduled appointment time. Increase attendance from 0% to 10 -50% GI provider are able to attend Wednes day's GI Oncology conferences The Team Rebecca Miksad, Physician Diane Savarese, Physician Andrea Bullock, Physician Benjamin Schlechter, Physician Jessica Zerillo, Physician Carol Pilgrim, Nurse Practitioner Lois Hartsough, Administra tive Manager Cli nical Operations Tyler Britton, Practice Coordinator Michelle McGrory, Nursing Director Kelly Noonan, Practice Manager Amanda Souza, Administrative Assistant Irene Jordan, Application Specialist -Ambulatory Systems Chris Rodrigues, Senior Project Manager -Office of Improvement and Innovation, i 2The I nterventions From July through December 2015, the team designed a strategy to build a standardized schedule template for physicians, fellows, and nurse practitioners . Standardized a ppointment types and lengths using 20 and 40 minute visit types for revisits Designed a provider template blueprint to visualize the flow of patient Visit types developed in CCC to automate the scheduling process using special features such as concurrent visits and max lead time Pilot a new check out process including a new check out slip to improve communication between providers and schedulers The Results/Progress to Date In January 2016 templates went live in CCC. The team is in the early phases of refining templates a nd the scheduling process. The following is apre and post comparison of Hem/Onc provider sched ules. The original model relied on doubl e booking patients in 30 minute slot .The new model utilize s a staggered start method to align the needs of the patient with the appropriate amoun t of provider time.

Next Steps/ What Should Happen Next Will measure template effectiveness by measuring patient volume, appointment availability, as well as process measures such as on time start. February through April ,monthly meetings will gather feedback on how to improve template performance as well as develop care coordination workflows to optimize patient flow.2016 Annual Report28 Leon V. & Marilyn L. Rosenberg Clinical Cancer CenterSILVERMAN #6 Improving Patient Outcomes with Therapy During & After Head & Neck Cancer Treatment For more information, contact: Cynthia Wise Wagner, MS, CCC -SLP, BCS- S cwagner@bidmc.harvard.eduThe Problem : Severe swallowing disorder s&decreased quality of life have been found in patients following concurrent chemotherapy & radiation treatment for head & neck cancer . Previous practice consisted of feeding tube placement (PEG) in all patients prior to the start of chemotherapy & radiation treatment (CXRT) for head & neck cancer. New research has shown better l ong-term swallowing outcomes & better preservation of swallowing -muscle strength/ functio n when patients continue to eat/ drink during treatment: Therefore, In 2013 the Head & Neck cancer team at BIDMC stopped placing feeding tubes prophylactically, and started following patients weekly in nutition and swallowing therapy . Aim/Goal s: To avoid weight loss / maximize nutrition & hydration To preserve swallowing -muscle strength, range of motion & function To reduce the severity of altered tissue integrity in the mouth & throat To provide education/ strategies to successfully manage the side effects of CXRT To improve long -term outcomes & quali ty of life for patients post -treatment To improve Interdisciplinary collaboration /coordination of care The Team Brooke Littleton, MS, CCC -SLP Robert Frankenthaler , MD Cynthia Wise Wagner, MS, CCC -SLP, BCS-S Mahadevan, MD Lauren Fay, RD, MD Frank McCaffrey, LICSW Nancy France, RNThe Results/Progress to Date Patients who are able to comply with this new treatment protocol: Resume a close-to -normal diet sooner post -treatment . Report improved qualit y of life wh en able to have P EG removed . Return to a full PO diet more quickly . Are more likely to avoid PEG placement or use PEG less . Swallowing therapy & Nutrition services are also provided in the BID - Needham Cancer Center since November, 2014. The I nterventions Speech-Language Pathologist & Dietician now participate in we ekly interdisciplinary Head & Neck rounds with MD team &Coordinate amonthly Head & Neck support group meeting facilitated by Social Work . Speech-Language Pathologist (SLP) provides: Pre therapy during &after CXRT & counseling /education to optimize swallowing function as status changes , decrease aspiration & improve quality of life. Registered Dietician (RD) provides: Pre & Po st-Treatment evaluation & nutrition counseling until the patient can independently manage nutrition needs &Weekly sessions during CXRT with RD to provide/update nutrition support recommendations &determine need for feeding tube. Lessons Learned Weekly s essions with patients during treatment result in better understanding of patient challenges &faster adapt ation of interventions to better achieve swallowing & nutritional goals. Close post -treatment follow -up is beneficial to prev ent severe swallowing disorders, especially in patients with longer life expectancy. Barriers to success include: Limited social support, F atigue, O ngoing substance use, Financial limitations, C ultural differences, Patient buy -in. Next Steps/ What Should Happen Next Collect Data on Patient Outcomes, including percentage of patients who are meeting nutritional needs with minimal dietary restrictions at post -treatment videoswallow, and at one year post -treatment. Swallowing & nutrition follow -up at regular intervals to provide ear ly identification &treatment prior to the development of late-radiation effects, such as fibrosis. 2016 Annual Report29 Leon V. & Marilyn L.

It provides Infusion Services to a diverse patient population and procedures such as Apheresis and Stem Cell Collections to both the inpatient and ambulatory population. Due to the varied nature of services and unpredictability of volume, patient scheduling became problematic. It became increasingly more difficult to accommodate patients in the time frame that they needed to be seen. This in tu rn decreased patient satisfaction. Goal To increase the availability of appointment times and to increase the efficiency of physical resources and staff time. Team Ryan Graue, S r.Project Manager , Improvement & Innovation Ayad Hamdan, Medical Director ,Infusion & Pheresis Theresa Normile, Nursing Director , Infusion & Pheresis Cindy Ferrucci, Resource Nurse , Infusion & Pheresis Michelle Knox, Resource Nurse , Infusion & Pheresis Deb , RN , Infusion & Pher esis Irene Jordan, Applications Specialist, Ambulatory Systems Interventions Booking method ology :Process changed from booking patients to nurses to booking patients to chairs. Nurses' schedules : Schedules changed to create consistent coverage throughou t the week. Booking parameters : Practice Assistants were trained to book appointments with specific parameters. Space reconfiguration :Dedicated space was created to accommodate Procedures and Urgent Visits. Results /Progress to Date Comparing 6/2015- 12/2015 to 6/2014- 12/2014, kept visits per clinic day increased 13% (37.4 vs. 33.1), and kept treatment hours per clinic day were up 7.3% (96.4 vs. 89.8). Lessons Learned Nursing sche dules were changed from fixed to var iable, which was a culture change for staff that required leadership and open communication. Also, specific scheduling parameters (such as limitations on how many patients can start simultaneously )needed to be explained in detail to help front desk staff learn. Next Steps Separating Infusion \"P ods\"and Procedure Rooms Building and rolling out an Appointment Finder tool Exploring additional creative scheduling opportunities for patients and providers (e.g., adjusting staggered starts) 2016 Annual Report30 Leon V. & Marilyn L.

Zerillo MD Background Aim: By February 1, 2016, 50% of patients initiating oral chemotherapy in biologics clinic will have documentation of comprehensive education, including administration, safe handling and side effects.Methods Results Conclusions & Next Steps Process Map (right): Team meeting identified lack of RN involvement in education of patients Cause & Effect (below): Team identified barriers to reaching goal of comprehensive education for new start oral chemotherapy and highlighted lack of multi -disciplinary approach Baseline: July 2014- August 2015, 33 new prescriptions; zero patients received comprehensive education First Plan -Do-Study -Act (PDSA): November 10, 2015 to February 1, 2016, 10 new prescriptions; 60% patients seen by RN and all received comprehensive education Reached aim of >50% of patients receiving comprehensive education by integrating nursing Achieved special cause with single point post -intervention above pre- intervention upper control limit Plan to implement second PDSA cycle adding RN follow -up phone call 1- 2 weeks after new start to current intervention Evaluate impact of RN education on patient satisfaction Measure and record time for RN education to help assess feasibility of expanding process to all oncology clinics Shift of chemotherapy from intravenous to oral administration leaves patients vulnerable to errors 2013 American Society of Clinical Oncology/Oncology Nursing Society provide guidelines for oral chemotherapy education, including administration, safe handling and side effects Patients prescribed oral chemotherapy at BIDMC currently have inconsistent oncology nursing involvement A multi- disciplinary team of MDs, NP, RN, and pharmacist selected for the process improvement project to pilot in biologics clinic (caring for patients with renal cell cancer andmelanoma) Survey of clinicians with response rate 100% (n=9) ranked patient education as top priority; lack of nursing involvement and time most common contributing factors to patients not receiving comprehensive education Intervention : Team created drug specific template notes for documentation in electronic medical record RN education session utilized template as a script for reviewing administration, safe handling and side effects in person or by phone by first follow up appointment Problem Statement: Patients receive variable education regarding administration, safe handling, and side effects when initiating oral chemotherapy. The barriers were most often lack of time, RN involvement, standardization, and written resources. Least often the task was completed but not documented. Priority Matrix (figure not shown): Team identified possible interventions to improve comprehensive education and then rated them by the degree of difficulty to implement as well as the degree of impact. Used matrix as a guide for choosing first intervention. Intervention Abstract # 81; Contact: mshea4@bidmc.harvard.edu 2016 Annual Report31 Leon V. & Marilyn L. Rosenberg Clinical Cancer CenterSILVERMAN #9Patient Preferences & Understanding of the Breast Imager's Role in Performing and Communicating Biopsy Results For more information, contact: Hannah Perry, MD, MS, Resident in Diagnostic Radiology hperry@bidmc.harvard.ed uThe Problem Health care is becoming more of a value -based system and as a result, r adiologists need to increase their visibility and role in clinical medicine. Wi thin the field of breast radiology ,staff routinely communicate all results of diagnostic e xams with a patient directly, at the conclusion of the study. However, biopsy results are typically communicated to the patient by the referring clinician. Given the breast radiologists understanding of the management of a wide array of pathologic results ,perhaps patients would prefer to hear results directly from the clinician performing the biopsy , which would increase radiologist visibility and perceived value . Aim/Goal 1)To evaluate patient understanding of the breast radiologist and their role in breast care. 2) To evaluate from whom patients want to hear breast biopsy results, and with what mode of communication. 3) To understand if the interaction between the patient and the radiologist impacted the patient's perception of the breast radiolo gist, and the desired method of communication. The Team 1)Breast Imagers: Jordana Phillips, MD, Hannah Perry, MD, MS, Vandana Dialani, MD ,Valerie J. Fein-Zachary, MD , MD ,Priscilla J. Slanetz, MD, MPH ,Shambhavi Venkataraman, MD ,Richard E. Sharpe JR, MD, MBA ,Tejas S. Mehta, MD, MPH 2)Breast Imaging Technologists and Technical Assistants 3)Breast Imaging Nurse Practitioner: Nancy Littlehale, NP The I nterventions For this quality assurance study, an anonymous 2 -part survey was given t o patients to complete before and after undergoing either an ultrasound -guided core biopsy or a stereotactic biopsy. The survey was created using SurveyMonkey\u00ae .Patient information gathered through the survey included data on demographics, familiarity withtheBIDMC breast imaging department , and the patient's pre- and post -biopsy understanding of what a breast radiologist is and their role in breast care. Patients were also asked from whom they wanted to hear their biopsy results and with what method . Initial data collection took place during March 2015 -October 2015. The Results/Progress to Date A total of 155/572 (27%) patients completed both portions of the survey. Lessons Learned Only 27% of eligible patients completed the survey. Among patients who responded, fewer than 60% knew that a breast radiologist is a physician, but 95% felt that the breast radiologist was essential to their care. This suggest slack of understanding of the breast radiologist , and is an opportunity for patient educa tion. Regardless of the pathology , patients want to hear biopsy res ultsfrom whoever will call soonest , followed by the ordering provider. In both groups, patients preferred to receive results communication byphone. Next Steps/ What Should Happen Next We will p rovide patient education on what a breast radiologist is and their role in breast health. We will also begin surveying referring physicians to evaluate their preferences regarding biopsy result communication. We will use this data to inform future practice change.2016 Annual Report32 Leon V. & Marilyn L. Rosenberg Clinical Cancer CenterSILVERMAN #10Wide Excision Alone for DCIS -What is the optimal screening interval after initial diagnosis? Are there predictors of recurrence? For more information, contact: Pritesh Mehta M.D., Department of Radiology. pmehta@bidmc.harvard.edu.The Problem Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast is increasingly diagnosed, and now represents 20 -25% of all breast cancers in the United States. An option for treatment of DCIS entails breast conserving surgery (BCS) followed by radiation thera py, however, given recent concerns for over treatment, many providers opt to follow patients with close imaging intervals at 6 -month intervals for 2-5 years following surgery, rather than undergoing radiation therapy. There is great variation in practices across providers at our hospital and institutions around the country in terms of how these patients should be followed. Aim/Goal 1) To determine the optimal imaging interval for women diagnosed with DCIS treated only with wide local excision. 2) To identify patient characteristics and risk factors to predict a higher risk of recurrence. The Team Dr. Pritesh Mehta M.D. Department of Radiology Dr. Alessandra Mele, M.D. Department of Surgery. Dr. Abram Recht M.D. Department of Radiation Oncology . Dr. Alexa nder Brook PhD. Department of Radiology Dr. Ranjna Sharma M.D. Department of Surgery . Dr. Priscilla Slanetz M.D., MPH Department of Radiology . Methods All patients with DCIS treated with wide local excision alone (WLE) at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, between 2000 and 2010 were identified. Of the 281 patients in this cohort, 59 patients were excluded because they were not followed in our institution after undergoing WLE. 222 patients remained eligible. For each patient, we collected data on imaging interval, demographics, parity, risk factors, tumor specific characteristics, personal or family history of breast cancer, exogenous hormone use, tobacco use, comorbidities, and genetic mutation carrier status. Statistical analysis entailed th e use of a paired t -test and Fischer exact test.The Results . Conclusions Next Steps The data w ill be presented to the BIDMC breast radiology section, in hopes of garnering further discussion, and possibly effecting change in individual physician practice. The study will be submitted for national peer review, in hopes of publication and stimulating policy discussions regarding optimum imaging interval for this population of patients. 2016 Annual Report33 Leon V. & Marilyn L.
