A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Defense Research Sciences Program Element is budgeted in the Basic Research Budget Activity because it provides the technical foundation for long-term National Security enhancement through the discovery of new phenomena and the exploration of the potential of such phenomena for Defense applications. It supports the scientific study and experimentation that is the basis for more advanced knowledge and understanding in information, electronic, mathematical, computer, and materials sciences. The Math and Computer Sciences project supports scientific study and experimentation on new mathematical and computational algorithms, models, and mechanisms in support of long-term national security requirements. Modern analytic and information technologies enable important new military capabilities and drive the productivity gains essential to U.S. economic competitiveness. Conversely, new classes of threats, in particular threats that operate in or through the cyber domain, put military systems, critical infrastructure, and the civilian economy at risk. This project aims to magnify these opportunities and mitigate these threats by leveraging emerging mathematical and computational capabilities including computational social science, artificial intelligence, machine learning and reasoning, data science, complex systems modeling and simulation, and theory of computation. The basic research conducted under the Math and Computer Sciences project will produce breakthroughs that enable new capabilities for national security and homeland defense. The Cyber Sciences project supports long-term national security requirements through scientific research and experimentation in cyber security. Information technologies enable important new military capabilities and drive the productivity gains essential to U.S. economic competitiveness. Meanwhile, cyber threats grow in sophistication and number, and put sensitive data, classified computer programs, mission-critical information systems, and future economic gains at risk. The basic research conducted under the Cyber Sciences project will produce breakthroughs necessary to enhance the resilience of DoD information systems to current and emerging cyber threats.

In seeking to continue the phenomenal progress in microelectronics innovation that has characterized the last few decades, the project should provide DoD with new, improved, or potentially revolutionary device options for accomplishing these critical functions. The resulting technologies should help maintain knowledge of the enemy, communicate decisions based on that knowledge, and substantially improve the cost and performance of military systems. Research areas include analog, mixed signal, and photonic circuitry for communications and other applications; alternative computer architectures; and magnetic components to reduce the size of Electromagnetic (EM) and sensing systems. Other research could support field-portable electronics with reduced power requirements, ultra-high density information storage \"on-a-chip\", and new approaches to nanometer-scale structures, molecules, and devices. The Beyond Scaling Sciences project will support investigations into materials, devices, and architectures to provide continued improvements in electronics performance with or without the benefit of Moore's Law (silicon scaling). Within the next ten years, traditional scaling will start to encounter the fundamental physical limits of silicon, requiring fresh approaches to new electronic systems. Over the short term, DoD will therefore need to unleash circuit specialization in order to maximize the benefit of traditional silicon. Over the longer term, DoD and the nation will need to engage the computer, material, and mechanical sciences to explore electronics improvements through new non-volatile memory devices that combine computation, memory, and new automated design tools using machine learning. Other memory devices could also leverage an emerging understanding of the physics of magnetic states, electron spin properties, topological insulators, or phase-changing materials. Beyond Scaling programs will address fundamental exploration into each of these areas. The Materials Sciences project provides the fundamental research that underpins the design, development, assembly, and optimization of advanced materials, devices, and systems for DoD applications in areas such as robust diagnostics and therapeutics, novel energetic materials, and complex hybrid systems. The Transformative Sciences project supports research and analysis that leverages converging technological forces and transformational trends in information-intensive subareas of the social sciences, life sciences, manufacturing, and commerce. The project integrates these diverse disciplines to improve military adaptation to sudden changes in requirements, threats, and emerging/converging trends, especially trends that have the potential to disrupt military operations or threaten National Security. Specific research in this project will investigate technologies to enable detection of novel threat agents (e.g., bacterial pathogens) and maintain warfighter health, as well as create innovative materials of interest to the military (e.g., self-healing materials).

Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2018 FY 2019 FY 2020 Title: Human Social Systems Description: The social sciences provide essential theories and models that can enable deeper understanding of human social systems and behaviors relevant to national security such as humanitarian aid, disaster relief, and stability support missions, as well as tactical, operational, strategic, and policy-level decision-making across the DoD. However, current limitations to the speed, scalability and reproducibility of empirical social science research continue to hamper its practical use by the DoD. Additionally, current social behavioral models often fail to accurately interpret social behaviors because they do not sufficiently capture diversity of context. The Human Social Systems thrust will address these limitations by focusing on the following technical challenges: (1) developing and validating new methods, models and tools to perform rigorous, reproducible experimental research at scales necessary to understand emergent properties of human social systems; (2) identifying methods to better characterize and quantify properties, dynamics, and behaviors of different social systems to enable better and more confident forecasting of changes in social systems, particularly when under stress; and (3) developing an understanding of the complex effect of context and incorporating these effects into social science models. This research thrust will provide DoD with new, reliable strategies to better understand and respond to social system issues at city scale and will significantly improve DoD ability to assess intent, deception, and other social behaviors. FY 2019 Plans: - Integrate new capabilities for experimentally testing and validating multiple models of human social systems and behavior. - Develop scoring methods to quantify the predictive accuracy of different models across different social experimental designs. - Test the efficiency and value of enhanced reproducibility for accelerating rigorous understanding of human social systems and behaviors.18.767 26.608 27.000 Volume 1 - 4 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0601101E: DEFENSE RESEARCH SCIENCES UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 5 of 45 R-1 Line #2Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2020 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Date: March 2019 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / 1R-1 DEFENSE RESEARCH SCIENCESProject (Number/Name) CCS-02 / MATH AND COMPUTER SCIENCES B.

FY 2019 to FY 2020 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY increase reflects minor program repricing. Title: World Modelers Description: The World Modelers program is creating explanatory models for natural and human-mediated systems at regional and global scales. The world is highly interdependent, and disruption of natural resources, supply chains, and production systems can have severe consequences. The World Modelers capability is focused on regional and global systems with the goal of generating timely indications and warnings of impending catastrophe. Water and food security are application domains of particular interest, as persistent drought may cause crops to fail, leading to migration and regional conflicts. The World Modelers program is developing techniques for automating the creation, maintenance, and validation of large-scale integrated models using publicly available news and analyst reports as a structuring mechanism, and government and commercial data as quantitative inputs. Advances in machine reading and learning, semantic technologies, big data analysis, geo-spatial and economic modeling, and environmental simulation bring this strategic capability within reach.15.633 16.000 17.500 Volume 1 - 6 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0601101E: DEFENSE RESEARCH SCIENCES UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 7 of 45 R-1 Line #2Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2020 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Date: March 2019 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / 1R-1 DEFENSE RESEARCH SCIENCESProject (Number/Name) CCS-02 / MATH AND COMPUTER SCIENCES B.

Title: Advanced Tools for Modeling and Simulation Description: The Advanced Tools for Modeling and Simulation thrust will develop foundational mathematical, computational, and multi-physics theories, approaches and tools to better represent, quantify and model complex DoD systems from multimodal data analysis through part/system design and fabrication. One focus area of this thrust is developing a unified mathematical framework to enable better visualization and analysis of massive, complex data sets. Rigorous mathematical theories are also being developed to address uncertainty in the modeling and design of complex multi-scale physical and engineering systems, incorporating capabilities to handle noisy data and model uncertainty that are well beyond the scope of current capabilities. Other work in this thrust focuses on developing the mathematical and computational tools required to generate and better manage the enormous complexity of design, ultimately allowing designers to more easily discover non-intuitive (yet realizable) designs that fully leverage new materials and advanced manufacturing approaches now available. Outcomes from this thrust will improve the speed and accuracy of modeling and simulation, as well as enable management of complexity across DoD devices, parts and systems. Another focus area of this thrust is multi-physics models for predicting behavior and non-intuitive failure pathways for complex, dynamic physical systems. FY 2019 Plans: - Incorporate variability in shaping and material properties under multiple types of physics in analysis and synthesis of real world designs. - Investigate multi-physics analysis and synthesis capabilities for multiple different design representations. - Demonstrate efficacy of alternative design approaches on DoD relevant design challenge problems. - Demonstrate rapidly adaptable conceptual design on a DoD relevant problem.13.466 14.200 15.400 Volume 1 - 8 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0601101E: DEFENSE RESEARCH SCIENCES UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 9 of 45 R-1 Line #2Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2020 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Date: March 2019 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / 1R-1 DEFENSE RESEARCH SCIENCESProject (Number/Name) CCS-02 / MATH AND COMPUTER SCIENCES B.

FY 2019 to FY 2020 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2020 increase reflects expanded research in the development of multi-physics models to predict behavior and non- intuitive failure pathways for complex, dynamic physical systems. Title: Communicating With Computers (CWC) Description: The Communicating With Computers (CWC) program is advancing human-computer interaction by enabling computers to comprehend language, gesture, facial expression and other communicative modalities in context. Since the very beginning of the field, artificial intelligence has sought to create machines that can use language, interact naturally with humans, and form abstractions and concepts. Human language is inherently ambiguous, so humans depend strongly on perception of the physical world and shared context to communicate efficiently. CWC will provide computers with analogous capabilities to sense the physical world, encode the physical world in a perceptual structure, and link language to this perceptual encoding. To accomplish this, CWC will apply and extend research in language, vision, gesture recognition and interpretation, dialog management, cognitive linguistics, and the psychology of visual encoding, which are essential for human communication. CWC will also extend the communication techniques developed for physical contexts to nonphysical contexts and virtual constructs. These CWC advances in foundational areas of artificial intelligence will contribute to future military capabilities in robotics and command and control.

FY 2019 to FY 2020 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2020 decrease reflects ramping down of development of human-computer interaction technologies and a shift in focus to demonstrations and evaluation of human-machine communication capabilities. Title: Complex Hybrid Systems Description: The Complex Hybrid Systems program thrust is focused on exploring fundamental science, mathematics, and computational approaches to collectives, complex hybrid (e.g., human-machine) systems and systems-of-systems across a variety of DoD-relevant domains.

Title: Building Resource Adaptive Software from Specifications (BRASS) Description: The Building Resource Adaptive Software from Specifications (BRASS) program is developing an automated framework that permits software systems to seamlessly adapt to changing resource conditions in an evolving operational environment. Effective adaptation is realized through rigorously defined specifications that capture application resource assumptions and resource guarantees made by the environment. The current manual adaptation paradigm is based on corrective patching, which is time-consuming, error-prone, and expensive. Predicting the myriad of possible environment changes that an application may encounter in its lifetime is problematic, and existing reactive approaches are brittle and often incorrect. The use of specification-based adaptation will allow BRASS applications to be correctly restructured in real time whenever stated assumptions or guarantees are broken. This restructuring is optimized to trade off execution fidelity and functionality for continued operation. BRASS will create tools to automatically discover and monitor resource changes, build new analyses to infer deep resource-based specifications, and implement compiler and runtime transformations that can efficiently adapt to resource changes. FY 2019 Plans: - Develop scalable whole-system, resource-aware analysis tools to infer deep resource-based specifications. - Develop optimizing and embeddable compilers to synthesize resource-efficient program variants. - Extend synthesis tools to automatically discover and monitor resource changes for large-scale software systems such as robotics operating systems. - Construct integrated toolchains that automatically adapt software to changing resource conditions, and demonstrate and evaluate the effectiveness of the integrated adaptation technologies on laboratory systems.

Title: Guaranteeing AI Robustness against Deception (GARD) Description: The Guaranteeing AI Robustness against Deception (GARD) program, expanding on technical challenges encountered in the Lifelong Learning Machines program, will develop techniques to make artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms and systems more robust in the presence of deceptive data and adversarial attack. Concurrent with the recent explosion of interest in ML, deception attacks that manipulate a ML system into an erroneous response have also emerged. While such deception attacks against ML have become sophisticated and varied, the development of defensive capabilities for ML systems has not been maintained. The GARD program will address the growing need for defensive ML capabilities by developing techniques to establish robustness properties of ML systems, and to defend against possible attacks. The techniques developed under RAIAD will be essential if the DoD is to rely on ML systems in contested environments.

Title: Learning with Less Labels (LwLL) Description: The Learning with Less Labels (LwLL) program, addressing a key issue encountered by the Data-Driven Discovery of Models program (budgeted in PE 0602702E, Project TT-13), will develop technology to greatly reduce the amount of labeled data required to train machine learning (ML) systems. In supervised ML, the system learns by example to recognize things, such as objects in images or speech. Humans provide these examples to ML systems during their training in the form of labeled data. With enough labeled data on which to train ML systems, it is generally possible to build useful models, but training accurate models currently requires large amounts of labeled data that can be costly to obtain. LwLL will address this problem by creating ML algorithms that learn and adapt more efficiently than current ML approaches, and by formally deriving the limits of machine learning and adaptation. LwLL-based ML systems will be easier to train and use in variable, unpredictable, real-world environments.

This has prevented the successful integration of AI technology into many transformative DoD applications. To address these limitations the Foundational AI science thrust will focus on the development of new learning architectures that enhance AI systems' ability to handle uncertainty, reduce vulnerabilities, and improve robustness for DoD AI systems. One focus area of this thrust is the ability to embed known physics, mathematics, and other prior knowledge to improve performance of AI systems, particularly for problem sets involving incomplete, sparse and noisy data. Another focus area is the development of a model framework for quantifying performance expectations and limits of AI systems.

Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2018 FY 2019 FY 2020 Title: Transparent Computing Description: The Transparent Computing program is developing technologies to enable the implementation of more effective security policies across distributed systems. The scale and complexity of modern information systems obscure linkages between security-related events, making it hard to discover attacks such as advanced persistent threats (APTs). The Transparent Computing program will create the capability to propagate security-relevant information, track complete knowledge of event provenance, and ensure component interactions are consistent with established behavior profiles and policies.

Title: SafeWare Description: The SafeWare program developed new code obfuscation techniques for protecting software from reverse engineering. At present, adversaries can extract sensitive information from stolen software, which could include cryptographic private keys, special inputs/failsafe modes, and proprietary algorithms. Today's state-of-the-art in software obfuscation adds junk code (loops that do nothing, renaming of variables, redundant conditions, etc.) that is not resilient against automated tools. Recent breakthroughs in theoretical cryptography have the potential to make software obfuscation into a mathematically rigorous science, very much like what the Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) algorithm did for the encryption of messages in the 1970s. In its present form, cryptographic obfuscation incurs too much runtime overhead to be practical. The SafeWare program took this very early-stage obfuscation theory and increased its practicality and efficiency.9.960 - - Accomplishments/Planned Programs Subtotals 44.094 12.801 - C.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Electronic Sciences project is for basic exploration of electronic and optoelectronic devices, circuits, and processing concepts to meet the military's need for near real-time information gathering, transmission, and processing. In seeking to continue the phenomenal progress in microelectronics innovation that has characterized the last few decades, the project should provide DoD with new, improved, or potentially revolutionary device options for accomplishing these critical functions. The resulting technologies should help maintain knowledge of the enemy, communicate decisions based on that knowledge, and substantially improve the cost and performance of military systems. Research areas include analog, mixed signal, and photonic circuitry for communications and other applications; alternative computer architectures; and magnetic components to reduce the size of Electromagnetic (EM) and sensing systems. Other research could support field-portable electronics with reduced power requirements, ultra-high density information storage \"on-a-chip\", and new approaches to nanometer-scale structures, molecules, and devices. Within this project, Beyond Scaling programs will support investigations into materials, devices, and architectures to provide continued improvements in electronics performance with or without the benefit of Moore's Law (silicon scaling). Within the next ten years, traditional scaling will start to encounter the fundamental physical limits of silicon, requiring fresh approaches to new electronic systems. Over the short term, DoD will therefore need to unleash circuit specialization in order to maximize the benefit of traditional silicon. Over the longer term, DoD and the nation will need to engage the computer, material, and mechanical sciences to explore electronics improvements through vertical circuit integration for improved computation or non-volatile memory devices that combine computation and memory. Other memory devices could also leverage an emerging understanding of the physics of magnetic states, electron spin properties, topological insulators, or phase-changing materials. Beyond Scaling programs will address fundamental exploration into each of these areas. The Beyond Scaling programs move to Project ES-02, Beyond Scaling Sciences, in FY 2019. B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2018 FY 2019 FY Title: Magnetic The Magnetic Miniaturized and Monolithically Integrated Components (M3IC) program aims to integrate magnetic components onto semiconductor materials, improving the size and functionality of electromagnetic (EM) systems for communications, radar, and electronic warfare (EW). Current EM systems use magnetic components such as circulators, inductors, and isolators that are bulky and cannot be integrated with electronic circuitry. This limits the utility of the magnetic components as well as their ability to impact overall system performance and function. Reducing the Size, Weight, And Power (SWaP) of magnetic components and integrating them onto semiconductor chips, however, could enable broader exploitation of magnetic materials and provide new mechanisms for the control and manipulation of EM signals. For instance, tighter integration could yield smaller radar systems, higher bandwidth communication over longer ranges, improved jam resistance, and more resilient EW systems.

For classical antennas, the minimum antenna size for efficient transmission is related to the wavelength of the RF signal. This fundamental property prevents reducing the size of today's ULF and VLF transmitting antennas, which are up to a mile wide. Whereas traditional antennas generate electromagnetic waves by driving current through a conductive material, AMEBA takes a novel approach, mechanically moving an electrical charge or magnet to generate electromagnetic waves at ULF and VLF. This mechanical coupling provides unique advantages over traditional approaches at these frequencies, most notably greater than 1,000x reduction in antenna size. AMEBA will focus on developing both the materials and precision-controlled electromechanical systems required for an efficient transmitter system. This new capability would enable a range of applications including hard-to-jam wireless communications for use over very long distances and short- range underground and underwater RF links. Other potential applications include terrestrial navigation systems for GPS-denied environments and ground-penetrating radar for detecting unexploded ordnance, underground facilities, and tunnels.

Title: SHort Range Independent Microrobotics Program (SHRIMP) Description: The SHort Range Independent Microrobotics Program (SHRIMP) will develop microrobots with the ability to enter constrained disaster areas such as collapsed buildings for search and rescue operations. These sugar cubed-sized microrobots could obtain local sensing data to assist with location of injured persons or critical infrastructure failures. The capabilities of the developed microrobots will be tested through a series of Olympic-themed events at the end of the program. The primary technical developments needed are in the efficiency, robustness, and control of millimeter-scale actuators, which allow the robots to move using new materials, processing, and sensor integration techniques, and in the power and energy capacity of batteries, which provide the power required for the microrobot to move and sense stimuli. Complete platforms will require access controls for Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI). Successful execution of the SHRIMP program will advance the micro-robotics field, allowing for practical robots to assist in disaster relief efforts in environments for which traditional robotics cannot efficiently operate due to their larger size. A companion applied research effort is funded in PE 0602716E, Project ELT-01.

Title: Atomic-Photonic Integration (A-PhI) Description: The Atomic-Photonic Integration (A-PhI) program, building on technology developed in the Direct On-Chip Digital Optical Synthesis (DODOS) program, aims to reduce the complexity of atomic clocks and gyroscopes by using integrated photonics for Position, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) applications. A-PhI will demonstrate that a compact photonic integrated chip can replace the optical assembly for trapped atomic gyroscopes and clocks without degrading the performance of the device. PNT is a critical resource for all DoD missions such as communications, navigation, reconnaissance, and electronic warfare. While PNT needs are usually met by using the Global Positioning System, GPS signals are vulnerable to a variety of disruption modalities and a fallback from GPS is essential. Currently, in the absence of GPS, tactical grade clocks and tactical/navigation grade Inertial Measurement Units can provide GPS-like accuracy for the short term. However, longer-term GPS independent strategies are still desirable. A-PhI will enable long-term GPS independence and enable PNT accuracy better than GPS for short durations. FY 2019 Plans: - Develop preliminary architectures for trapped atom gyroscopes. - Design low phase noise oscillators compatible with the A-PhI performance metrics. - Design, fabricate and characterize preliminary components of a photonic integrated chip for the trapped atom clock.

HAVOC amplifiers would enable these systems to access the high-frequency millimeter-wave portion of the Electromagnetic (EM) spectrum, facilitating increased range and other performance improvements. Today, the effectiveness of combat operations across all domains increasingly depends on DoD's ability to control and exploit the EM spectrum and to deny its use to adversaries.

Operating at higher frequencies, such as the millimeter-wave, helps DoD to overcome these issues and offers numerous tactical advantages such as high data-rate communications and high resolution and sensitivity for radar and sensors. HAVOC will fund basic research in vacuum electronics to improve understanding of the various phenomena governing vacuum electronic amplifiers operating at mm-wave frequencies above 75 GHz. Focus areas will include modeling and simulation techniques, advanced manufacturing methods, novel beam-wave interaction structures, high current density and long-life cathodes, and other relevant topics. Applied research efforts are funded in PE 0602716E, Project ELT-01.

Title: Precise Robust Inertial Guidance for Munitions (PRIGM) Description: The Precise Robust Inertial Guidance for Munitions (PRIGM) program aims to identify, investigate, and demonstrate inertial sensor technologies for Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) in GPS-denied environments. When GPS is not available, these inertial sensors can provide autonomous PNT information. The program will exploit recent advances in integrating photonic (light-manipulating) components into electronics and in employing Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) as high-performance inertial sensors for use in extreme environments. Whereas conventional MEMS inertial sensors can suffer from inaccuracies due to factors such as temperature sensitivity, new photonics-based PNT techniques have demonstrated the ability to mitigate these inaccuracies. PRIGM will focus on two areas. By 2020, it aims to develop and transition a Navigation- Grade Inertial Measurement Unit (NGIMU), a state-of-the-art MEMS device, to DoD platforms. By 2030, it aims to develop Advanced Inertial MEMS Sensors (AIMS) that can provide gun-hard, high-bandwidth, high dynamic range navigation for GPS-free munitions. These advances should enable navigation applications, such as smart munitions, that require low-cost, size, weight, and power inertial sensors with high bandwidth, precision, and shock tolerance. PRIGM will advance state-of-the-art MEMS gyros from TRL-3 devices to a TRL-6 transition platform, eventually enabling the Service Labs to perform TRL-7 field demonstrations.

Title: Signal Processing at RF (SPAR) Description: The Signal Processing at RF (SPAR) program will investigate advanced analog components to process radio frequency (RF) signals for communications, radar, and electronic warfare applications. Today, electronic components are limited in their ability to distinguish between two or more signals operating at the same frequency when one signal is strong enough to jam the others. The jamming signal, in this case, saturates the receiver electronics much like loud music drowns out a quiet conversation. By using advancements in new semiconductor materials, processing, and novel signal interaction mechanisms, SPAR components will be able to pick out friendly RF signals from both intentional and unintentional jamming signals, even when those signals sit on top of one another in frequency. This capability would enable a range of new applications including communications in contested battlefield RF environments, jamming the RF spectrum while maintaining communication, and full- duplex radio communication. Other potential applications include equipping mobile radios with SPAR-enabled front ends for simultaneous jam-resistant two-way communication and electronic warfare. FY 2019 Plans: - Design Phase 3 RF signal processing components with DoD communications grade performance capable of rejecting uncooperative in-band jamming by 100x and cooperative self-interference by 1,000,000x. - Fabricate and integrate the components developed during Phase 2 into a system-level design that extends Simultaneous Transmit and Receive (STAR) capability to Commercial, Off The Shelf (COTS) transceiver technology. - Perform field measurements on developed STAR system to demonstrate simultaneous bidirectional voice communications over 1 km capable of rejecting uncooperative in-band jamming by 30x and cooperative self-interference by 10,000x while maintaining communications integrity.

Title: Native Bioelectronic Interfaces Description: The Native Bioelectronic Interfaces effort will address the DoD need for improving warfighter recovery from injury by developing technologies that can accelerate the restoration and repair of complex tissues. This program will develop approaches that combine high-resolution biosensors to track the healing process in real-time with bioactuators to stimulate restoration where and when needed. The primary challenge to achieving this is the lack of a closed-loop interface that can manipulate highly complex signaling pathways in wounds and the developmental interdependencies that scale from cell to tissue. The program will develop new methods to convert dense multi-modal information into the body's native repair processes, and will leverage artificial intelligence to guide the delivery of the signals necessary for healing. Advances from this program will produce bioactuators that can release diverse stimuli with high spatial and temporal resolution, and biosensors that provide the requisite in situ measurement to guide the healing process. FY 2020 Plans: - Identify effective stimuli for directing growth, development, and repair. - Identify critical physiological changes and biomarkers that can report on cell growth and differentiation. - Develop first set of algorithms that can deliver preliminary intervention strategies.

Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2018 FY 2019 FY 2020 Title: Outpacing Infectious Disease Description: Military readiness and national security depend on the health and well-being of military service members. Unfortunately, today's antivirals and vaccines are often circumvented by fast-mutating viruses that evolve to develop drug resistance. Military service members often deploy to areas with such diseases that require new protective measures to maintain readiness. The Outpacing Infectious Disease thrust will investigate fundamental methods for using biology as a technology to create adaptive therapeutic response mechanisms to outpace viral diseases such as enabling co-evolution and co-transmission of newly developed therapeutics to ultimately outcompete the pathogen. Key advances expected from this research include identifying methods to discover and develop new classes of dynamic therapeutics for fast-mutating viruses. This approach represents a significant departure from conventional antiviral therapies, which typically rely on static solutions and continuous re- formulation and re-development in attempt to keep pace with emerging strains and disease variants. Advances in this area may be applied to the mitigation of known, new, or emerging diseases that impact military readiness and pose a National Security risk as a potential pandemic. FY 2019 Plans: - Apply predictive mathematical models to optimize therapeutic interfering particle (TIP) packaging and mobilization for increased efficacy. - Investigate factors that determine TIP long-term stability. - Optimize TIPs for selected viruses and evaluate in relevant animal models of infection. - Optimize TIP production, purification, and scale-up.

The Preventing the Emergence of Disease (PED) program will investigate how animal pathogens are transmitted to humans and explore novel approaches to prevent these events. Tools such as detailed molecular analysis and bioinformatics will be leveraged. Researchers will develop models to quantify the probability of pathogen disease transmission from animals to humans. Promising intervention approaches will be developed to prevent viral species jumps from animal reservoirs to humans. Predicting such jumps is a key capability to mitigating outbreaks originating in animal reservoirs. FY 2019 Plans: - Develop initial risk models of species jumps for selected viruses using biosurveillance data, geographic location, and animal- animal and/or animal-human interactions. - Develop preliminary mathematical models that predict parameters responsible for virus species jump and models that link viral genetics to transmission dynamics. - Establish experimental testbeds to validate model predictions and to test preemptive approaches. - Determine virus competence (ability to infect) in different vector species. - Initiate in vitro testing of preemptive approaches for suppressing viral jump.

The status quo for pharmacological intervention is one drug, one target, which often has many undesirable side effects. This program will create a platform to develop pharmacological interventions capable of modulating multiple targets within biological systems of the body, which will reduce side effects and promote safety. Research will focus on the integration of novel bioinformatics approaches, high-content physiological model systems, and new bio-orthogonal chemical synthesis methods to treat the system in order to achieve desired physiological effects. Progress in this area will lead to new pharmacological discovery and design principles that will lead to products that can be used to augment physical fitness training and maintenance for military populations.

FY 2019 to FY 2020 Increase/Decrease Statement: FY 2020 increase reflects program initiation. Title: Analysis and Adaptation of Human Resilience Description: The Analysis and Adaptation of Human Resilience program will explore new methods to maintain and optimize warfighter health in response to environmental insults such as new and emerging infectious diseases. Research efforts in this area will apply recent advances in comparative biology, genetic sequencing, omics technologies, and bioinformatics to develop new tools for modulating health to ensure warfighter readiness. One approach to achieve this goal is identifying the fundamental mechanisms that enable certain species to be tolerant to various environmental insults. Genomic and physiological analyses of a wide array of resilient animal species may be combined with sophisticated algorithms to identify important patterns of survival. By analyzing patterns in the underlying variability of host responses for resilient animals, one may formulate a survival blueprint to restore and maintain warfighter homeostasis in response to infection. This approach is orthogonal to traditional infectious disease research, which primarily relies on reducing the pathogen load through drug intervention. Research efforts within this program may enable discovery of novel methods to optimize human health against infectious diseases caused by multi-drug resistant pathogens. FY 2019 Plans: - Analyze the tolerance response across different animal species, infection models and those discovered in animals using open source human data sets. - Validate tolerance mechanisms in resilient animal models. - Test tolerance-based interventions in susceptible animal models. - Identify strategies for further developing interventions to improve warfighter health and performance.

Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2018 FY 2019 FY 2020 Description: Wounded warriors often suffer from neural injury due to spinal cord injury or amputations. Military personnel with amputated limbs get limited benefit from recent advances in prosthetic-limb technology because the user interface for controlling the limb is low-performance and unreliable. Through investments in the DARPA Reliable Neural-Interface Technology (RE-NET) program, novel interface systems have been developed that overcome these issues and are designed to last for the lifetime of the patient. The goal of the Prosthetic Hand Proprioception & Touch Interfaces (HAPTIX) program is to create the first bi-directional (motor & sensory) peripheral nerve implant for controlling and sensing advanced prosthetic limb systems. With a strong focus on transition, the HAPTIX program will create and transition clinically relevant technology in support of wounded warriors suffering from single or multiple limb loss. Research in this area will also address similar interface technologies with other nerve pathways such as the spinal cord. The anticipated transition partner is the Army.

Title: Neuro-Adaptive Technology Description: The Neuro-Adaptive Technology program is exploring and developing advanced technologies for real-time detection and monitoring of neural activity. One shortcoming of today's brain functional mapping technologies is the inability to obtain real- time correlation data that links neural function to human activity and behavior. Understanding the structure-function relationship as well as the underlying mechanisms that link brain and behavior is a critical step in providing real-time, closed-loop therapies for military personnel suffering from a variety of brain disorders. Efforts under this program examine the networks of neurons involved in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), traumatic brain injury (TBI), depression, and anxiety as well as determine how to best ameliorate these disorders. The objective for this program is to develop new hardware and modeling tools to better discriminate the relationship between human behavioral expression and neural function and to provide relief through novel devices. These tools will allow for an improved understanding of how the brain regulates behavior and will enable new, disorder-specific, dynamic neuro-therapies for treating neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders in military personnel. Technologies of interest under this program include devices for real-time detection of brain activity during operational tasks, time synchronized acquisition of brain activity and behavior, and statistical models that correlate neural activity with human behavioral expression.

Title: Restoration of Brain Function Following Trauma Description: The Restoration of Brain Function Following Trauma program exploited recent advances in the understanding and modeling of brain activity and organization to develop approaches to treat traumatic brain injury (TBI). Critical to success was the ability to detect and quantify functional changes that occur in the human brain during the formation of distinct new memories, and to correlate those changes with subsequent recall of those memories during performance of behavioral tasks. This program also developed neural interface hardware for monitoring and modulating neural activity responsible for successful memory formation in a human clinical population. The ultimate goal was identification of efficacious therapeutic approaches that could bypass and/or recover the neural functions underlying memory, which are often disrupted as a consequence of TBI.7.828 - - Title: Autonomous Diagnostics to Enable Prevention and Therapeutics (ADEPT) Description: The overarching goal of the Autonomous Diagnostics to Enable Prevention and Therapeutics (ADEPT) program was to increase our ability to rapidly respond to a disease or threat and improve individual readiness and total force health protection by providing centralized laboratory capabilities at non-tertiary care settings.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Information and Communications Technology Program Element is budgeted in the Applied Research budget activity because it is directed toward the application of advanced, innovative computing systems and communications technologies. The High Productivity, High-Performance Responsive Architectures project focuses on developing the computer hardware and associated software technologies required for future computationally- and data-intensive national security applications. Powerful new approaches are needed to manage the rapid growth in available sensor data, to leverage advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence, and to maintain the security of DoD information systems. The Cyber Security project is developing the computing, networking, and cyber security technologies required to protect DoD, U.S. government, and U.S. civilian information, information infrastructure, and mission-critical information systems. Information technologies enable important new military capabilities and drive the productivity gains essential to U.S. industry. The Artificial Intelligence and Human-Machine Symbiosis project develops technologies to enable machines to function not only as tools that facilitate human action but as trusted partners to human operators. Of particular interest are systems that can understand human speech and extract information contained in diverse media; answer questions, reach conclusions, and propose explanations; and learn, reason and apply knowledge gained through experience to respond intelligently to new and unforeseen events. Enabling computing systems with such human-like intelligence is now of critical importance because the tempo of military operations in emerging domains exceeds that at which unaided humans can orient, understand, and act.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The High Productivity, High-Performance Responsive Architectures project focuses on developing the computer hardware and associated software technologies required for future computationally- and data-intensive national security applications. Powerful new approaches are needed to manage the rapid growth in available sensor data, to leverage advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence, and to maintain the security of DoD information systems. The project therefore aims not only to create larger computing platforms but also to efficiently extract information out of large and chaotic data sets with embedded and low-size, weight, and power systems. Advances in these areas could allow DoD electronic systems to collaboratively manage scarce resources, such as the electromagnetic spectrum, and to adapt to new requirements and situations. Further, the resulting technologies, by being accessible to a wide range of application developers, should help develop new, sustainable computing systems for a broad spectrum of scientific and engineering applications. B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2018 FY 2019 FY 2020 Title: Spectrum Collaboration Challenge (SC2) Description: The Spectrum Collaboration Challenge (SC2) program seeks to catalyze the development of systems, called Collaborative Intelligent Radios (CIRs) that intelligently share and optimize wireless spectrum usage without prior knowledge of each other's operating characteristics. SC2 will address the increasing demand for and reliance on unfettered wireless access. Today, assured access to the wireless spectrum involves restricting particular types of radios and radio operators to certain sets of fixed, pre-determined frequencies. Although this spectrum allocation approach helps ensure different radio signals do not interfere with each other, it is inherently inefficient and vulnerable to attack. First, allocated portions of the spectrum can remain unused or underutilized. Second, adversaries can easily characterize static spectrum allocations, identifying which ones to exploit or attack. SC2 will address this challenge by leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning to optimize use of the spectrum in real-time. In particular, SC2 participants will be challenged to develop techniques that allow collaboration among dissimilar communications technologies. SC2 will conduct two preliminary competitions and one championship event over three years. The resulting technology will define a new class of radio systems that efficiently thrive in the absence of pre-planned spectrum. FY 2019 Plans: - Hold a second competition, to take place on the custom-built competition testbed. - Identify transition partner for the testbed post competition final event.18.000 25.184 2.000 Volume 1 - 63 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602303E: INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 4 of 29 R-1 Line #13Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2020 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Date: March 2019 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / 2R-1 Program INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGYProject (Number/Name) IT-02 / HIGH PRODUCTIVITY, HIGH- PERFORMANCE RESPONSIVE ARCHITECTURES B.

Title: RF Machine Learning Systems (RFMLS) Description: The RF Machine Learning Systems (RFMLS) program is addressing the performance limitations of conventional radio frequency (RF) systems such as radar, signals intelligence, electronic warfare, and communications. The performance of future RF systems in the DoD will be defined by their ability to adapt and respond to their environment in real-time. We currently lack both the algorithms and computational power to manage the volume of data and complexity of decision-making that will be required. RFMLS technology will develop machine learning techniques that are able to help manage this complexity by, for example, recognizing specific emitters or detecting anomalies in a cluttered environment. The objective of the RFMLS program is to both develop these foundational technologies and to apply them to relevant DoD systems. FY 2019 Plans: - Evaluate integratability of machine learning algorithms and architectures with candidate DoD RF hardware systems. - Complete first phase development of machine learning algorithms and architectures for the four challenge problems. - Test preliminary performance of solutions for the four challenge problems. - Complete development of an RF hardware system to host field testing and demonstrations.

The program will investigate advances in chip architecture and data analytics algorithms that can allow machines to infer meaning out of data based on the information needs of the warfighter. Program success would therefore enable the warfighter to understand far more of the battlespace in real time. The HIVE program moves to PE 0602716E/ Project ELT-02 in FY 2019. Title: Electronic Globalization Description: The Electronic Globalization effort aimed to develop advanced capabilities for validating the function of digital, analog, and mixed-signal integrated circuits (IC) given limited design specifications. These ICs are critical to nearly all military systems. Globalization and rapid growth in the commercial electronics industry have limited DoD's ability to influence and regulate IC fabrication. DoD today accounts for a relatively small portion of the overall IC market and the vast majority of IC manufacturing capacity lies overseas. As a result, parts acquired for DoD systems may not meet the stated specifications for performance and reliability. Electronic Globalization pursued the technologies required to address this and other risks to DoD IC's, such as reverse engineering, counterfeiting, and the theft of U.S. intellectual property. The effort supported the development of key risk-reduction techniques including advanced imaging and computational methods for identifying an IC's functional elements.2.000 - - Accomplishments/Planned Programs Subtotals 48.006 52.184 22.538 C.

B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2018 FY 2019 FY 2020 Title: Cyber-Hunting at Scale (CHASE) Description: The Cyber-Hunting at Scale (CHASE) program is developing data-driven tools for real-time cyber threat detection, characterization, and protection within enterprise-scale networks. U.S. computer networks are continually under attack, but at present no tools exist to efficiently extract the right data from the right device at the right time to analyze these attacks for DoD- scale information networks. For example, analysis of an in-memory exploit would require detailed data from a few devices, while analysis of a global botnet attack would require summary data from a great many devices.

Title: Cyber Fault-tolerant Attack Recovery (CFAR) Description: The Cyber Fault-tolerant Attack Recovery (CFAR) program is developing novel architectures to achieve cyber fault- tolerance with commodity computing technologies. The proliferation of processing cores in multi-core central processing units provides the opportunity to adapt fault-tolerant architectures proven in aerospace applications to mission-critical, embedded, and real-time computing systems. The CFAR program will combine techniques for detecting differences across functionally replicated systems with novel variants that exhibit differences in behavior under cyber attack, so that CFAR-enabled computing systems will quickly detect deviations in processing elements at attack onset and rapidly reboot to restore affected services. CFAR technologies are being developed in coordination with operational users. FY 2019 Plans: - Demonstrate an integrated CFAR system that protects against a wide range of threats in an operational environment. FY 2019 to FY 2020 Increase/Decrease Statement: The reflects program completion.17.030 6.000 - Title: Edge-Directed Cyber Technologies for Reliable Mission Communication (EdgeCT) Description: The Edge-Directed Cyber Technologies for Reliable Mission Communication (EdgeCT) program is developing technologies to enable reliable communications for military forces that operate in the presence of disrupted, degraded or denied wide-area networks. EdgeCT algorithms and software prototypes are implemented exclusively at the network edge, specifically on end hosts and/or on proxy servers fronting groups of such end hosts within a user enclave. EdgeCT systems sense and respond rapidly to network failures and attacks by dynamically adapting protocols utilized to exchange packets among these hosts, thereby implementing fight-through strategies that restore networked communication. This enables highly reliable networked communication for the military in the face of a wide variety of common network failure modes as well as cyber attacks9.280 3.000 - Volume 1 - 79 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602303E: INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 20 of 29 R-1 Line #13Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2020 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Date: March 2019 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / 2R-1 Program INFORMATION COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGYProject (Number/Name) IT-03 / CYBER SECURITY B.

FY 2019 Plans: - Harden technologies and complete transition to DoD's commercial network operators. FY 2019 to FY 2020 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2020 decrease reflects program completion. Title: System Security Integrated Through Hardware and firmware (SSITH) Description: The System Security Integrated Through Hardware and firmware (SSITH) program seeks to secure DoD and commercial electronic systems against cybersecurity threats by developing novel hardware/firmware security architectures and hardware design methodologies. Current responses to cybersecurity attacks typically consist of developing and deploying software patches to address specific vulnerabilities in a software firewall without addressing potential vulnerabilities in the underlying hardware architecture. To address this challenge, SSITH will drive new research in electronics hardware security and exploit current research in areas such as cryptographic-based computing and hardware verification. Implementation of these advanced ideas has been enabled by the extremely capable semiconductor technology driven by Moore's Law. The program will also investigate flexible hardware architectures that adapt to and limit the impact of new cybersecurity attacks. Finally, SSITH will seek to mitigate the potential negative impact of new security protection architectures on system performance and power usage. Once developed, SSITH capabilities will be applicable to both commercial and military electronic systems. The SSITH program moves to Project ELT-02, Beyond Scaling Technology, in FY 2019.18.420 - - Title: Supply Chain Hardware Integrity for Electronics Defense (SHIELD) Description: The Supply Chain Hardware Integrity for Electronics Defense (SHIELD) program aimed to develop a technology capable of confirming the authenticity of electronic parts at any time and place. Authenticating parts or detecting counterfeit components by current means has proven expensive, time-consuming, and of limited effectiveness. An alternative solution, maintaining complete control of the global supply chain using administrative controls, can also incur substantial costs. SHIELD instead sought to incorporate a small, inexpensive silicon chip (\"dielet\") into the packaging of genuine components. The dielet provided unique and encrypted component identification, enabling authentication from very close proximity. Since counterfeit electronic components pose a threat to the integrity and reliability of both commercial and DoD systems, SHIELD fulfilled a large, pressing, and evolving need for anti-counterfeit technologies.5.000 - - Title: Plan X 4.000 - - Volume 1 - 80 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602303E: INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 21 of 29 R-1 Line #13Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2020 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Date: March 2019 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / 2R-1 Program INFORMATION COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGYProject (Number/Name) IT-03 / CYBER SECURITY B.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Artificial Intelligence and Human-Machine Symbiosis project develops technologies to enable machines to function not only as tools that facilitate human action but as trusted partners to human operators. Of particular interest are systems that can understand human speech and extract information contained in diverse media; answer questions, reach conclusions, and propose explanations; and learn, reason, and apply knowledge gained through experience to respond intelligently to new and unforeseen events. Enabling computing systems with such human-like intelligence is now of critical importance because the tempo of military operations in emerging domains exceeds that at which unaided humans can orient, understand, and act. The technologies developed in the Artificial Intelligence and Human- Machine Symbiosis project will enable warfighters to make better decisions in complex, time-critical, battlefield environments; intelligence analysts to make sense of massive, incomplete, and contradictory information; and unmanned systems and semi-autonomous agents to perform critical missions in contested physical and virtual environments safely and reliably. B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2018 FY 2019 Title: Description: The Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) program is developing a new generation of machine learning techniques that are able to produce a rationale to explain the conclusions they reach. If current trends continue, future U.S. military autonomous systems will need to perform increasingly complex and sensitive missions, and AI will be critical to such systems. However, in order for developers, users, and senior leaders to feel confident enough to deploy and use AI-enabled systems, these systems must be able to explain their rationale, and their recommendations, decisions, and actions must be delivered in a way that military users can understand and trust. Today, most machine learning systems provide no explanations, or provide explanations that are too detailed, at the wrong level of abstraction, or not meaningful to a human user. XAI will develop the tools necessary to build explainable AI systems, in particular (1) new machine learning techniques that produce human-interpretable models and (2) user interfaces that generate explanations from those models meaningful to end-users. XAI implementations will be developed and demonstrated in next-generation autonomous, data analytics, and decision-support systems. FY 2019 Plans: - Evaluate the performance of the initial prototype systems against developer-selected test problems in autonomy and data analytics. - Formulate improved explainable machine learning methods and modified deep learning techniques, integrate these into prototypes, and refine and test.17.446 18.830 26.050 Volume 1 - 82 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602303E: INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 23 of 29 R-1 Line #13Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2020 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Date: March 2019 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / 2R-1 Program INFORMATION ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND HUMAN-MACHINE SYMBIOSIS B.

FY 2020 Plans: - Evaluate the performance and the explanation effectiveness against government-selected test problems in autonomy and data analytics. - Optimize explainable machine learning techniques and user interfaces for integration into prototype systems. - Expand the set of test problems in data analytics and autonomous systems for evaluating explanation effectiveness of the systems. - Refine the computational model of explanation, and show increased ability to predict the performance of explanations generated by the systems. FY 2019 to FY 2020 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2020 increase reflects continued development of explainable machine learning techniques, accelerated integration of techniques in machine learning systems, and expanded testing on problems in data analytics and autonomous systems. Title: Assured Autonomy Description: The Assured Autonomy program is developing rigorous design and analysis technologies for continual assurance of learning-enabled autonomous systems to guarantee safety properties in uncertain environments. Currently, the state of the art for test, evaluation, verification and validation is only applicable to non-learning systems operating in well-characterized environments. As a result, autonomous systems enabled by machine learning (e.g., deep neural nets for perception, reinforcement learning for control policies, and online model learning) lack rigorous safety assurance. Assured Autonomy is developing new techniques for modeling and system design, formal verification, simulation-based testing, machine learning, and safety-assured learning to provide continual assurance of learning-enabled autonomous systems. The technologies being developed in Assured Autonomy will enable the DoD to more rapidly and efficiently deploy learning-enabled autonomous systems that can be trusted to operate safely in uncertain environments. FY 2019 Plans: - Develop techniques and tools that construct formal semantics of assurance cases, provide dynamic interpretation of assurance cases, and modularize and automatically generate assurance cases from system design descriptions. - Develop algorithms that integrate and enforce safety constraints in learning-enabled systems.15.700 17.520 25.550 Volume 1 - 83 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602303E: INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 24 of 29 R-1 Line #13Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2020 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Date: March 2019 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / 2R-1 Program INFORMATION ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND HUMAN-MACHINE SYMBIOSIS B. Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2018 FY 2019 FY 2020 - Produce assurance challenge problems for different learning-enabled autonomous systems, and evaluate the effectiveness of safety-aware learning and safety constraint enforcement techniques. FY 2020 Plans: - Develop scalable methods addressing formal verification of safety properties of learning-enabled autonomous systems and scalable algorithms for dynamic evaluation of assurance cases. - Construct monitors to detect data-distribution shifts as the operating environment diverges from the training environment. - Assess the reliability and sensitivity of techniques to modeling assumptions for different learning-enabled autonomous systems. - Apply technologies to assurance challenge problems for several learning-enabled autonomous platforms of interest to the DoD. FY 2019 to FY 2020 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2020 increase is the result of development work accelerating and technologies being tested on several learning-enabled autonomous platforms. Title: Active Interpretation of Disparate Alternatives (AIDA) Description: The Active Interpretation of Disparate Alternatives (AIDA) program is developing a multi-hypothesis semantic engine that generates alternative interpretations of events, situations, and trends from a variety of unstructured sources for use in environments where there are noisy, conflicting, and potentially deceptive data. At present, information from each medium is often analyzed independently, without the context provided by information from other media, resulting in only one interpretation with alternatives being eliminated due to lack of evidence even in the absence of contradictory evidence. AIDA seeks to develop and demonstrate technology to automatically map information derived from multiple sources into a common semantic representation, aggregate information, resolve ambiguities, discover conflicting information, and generate and explore multiple interpretations of events, situations, and trends. If successful, AIDA will provide decision makers a capability to understand alternative explanations for available information and to make contingency plans accordingly. FY 2019 Plans: - Develop scalable automated techniques to integrate diverse information from multiple high-volume sources into the common semantic representation. - Develop techniques to extend and evolve existing ontologies using information from diverse sources. - Develop techniques to estimate the confidence of the generated interpretations, and formulate approaches for evaluating the accuracy of confidence estimates. - Evaluate techniques to identify semantically consistent adversarial misinformation on synthetic data. FY 2020 Plans: - Enhance multimedia analytics through use of feedback from generated hypotheses. - Develop techniques to limit the over-generation of hypotheses by automatically discarding irrelevant or duplicated hypotheses.16.850 17.780 25.000 Volume 1 - 84 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602303E: INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 25 of 29 R-1 Line #13Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2020 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Date: March 2019 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / 2R-1 Program INFORMATION ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND HUMAN-MACHINE SYMBIOSIS B. Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2018 FY 2019 FY 2020 - Develop an intuitive interface to allow users to modify the extracted semantic elements and the generated hypotheses at any stage of the analysis. - Collaborate with transition partners to assess the validity and completeness of generated hypotheses using real-world data. FY 2019 to FY 2020 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2020 increase reflects continued development of techniques for generating multiple alternative interpretations from multimedia data and expanded adversarial evaluations of techniques on synthetic and real-world data. Title: Low Resource Languages for Emergent Incidents (LORELEI) Description: The Low Resource Languages for Emergent Incidents (LORELEI) program is developing technology to rapidly field machine translation and other language processing capabilities for low-resource foreign languages. The U.S. military operates globally, and frequently encounters low-resource languages, i.e., languages for which few linguists are available and no automated human language technology capability exists. Processing foreign language materials requires protracted effort, and current systems rely on huge, manually-translated, manually-transcribed, or manually-annotated data sets. As a result, systems currently exist only for languages in widespread use and in high demand. LORELEI takes a different approach by leveraging language-universal resources, projecting from related-language resources, and fully exploiting a broad range of language-specific resources. These capabilities will be exercised to rapidly provide situational awareness based on information from any language in support of emergent missions such as humanitarian assistance/disaster relief, terrorist attack response, peacekeeping, and infectious disease response. FY 2019 Plans: - Develop techniques to establish situational awareness from text and speech of low-resource languages. - Extend development of techniques to determine strength of opinions and beliefs to understand urgency and status of emerging situations. - Evaluate performance on additional languages, and measure progress on the languages evaluated in the previous year. FY 2020 Plans: - Implement final improvements and demonstrate capabilities on languages of interest to potential transition sponsors. FY 2019 to FY 2020 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2020 decrease is the result of development work ramping down and focus shifting to technology (HMS) program will conduct applied research to enable machines to collaborate with humans as colleagues, partners, and teammates.

Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2018 FY 2019 FY 2020 on complexity. If successful, HMS technologies will enable machines to do more than execute pre-programmed instructions. Rather, HMS-enabled machines will understand speech; extract information contained in diverse media; learn, reason and apply knowledge gained through experience; identify and work to fill knowledge gaps; extrapolate causal phenomena to anticipate predictable outcomes; and respond intelligently to new and unforeseen events. A companion basic research effort is funded in PE 0601101E, Project CCS-02. FY 2019 Plans: - Create human-aligned agent technologies that learn to support individual human operators in the performance of planning tasks. - Devise social Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches for creating high-performing human-machine teams of individuals and semi- autonomous systems with complementary characteristics/capabilities. - Identify extensions to algorithmic game theory based AI techniques needed for complex military decision problems. - Develop methods for extracting generalized and compressed knowledge representations from data and information to enable more adaptable AI and machine learning approaches. FY 2020 Plans: - Formulate goal reasoning techniques to serve as the basis for curious machines that identify and fill knowledge gaps. - Design computational agents capable of advising and guiding humans in the performance of real-world tasks. - Develop and demonstrate social AI-based techniques for evaluating and selecting human-machine teams that perform at a higher level than teams constituted using only individual performance assessment techniques. - Incorporate generalized and compressed representations of knowledge in AI and machine learning systems that improve performance on tasks as they gain experience and receive feedback from a human operator. FY 2019 to FY 2020 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2020 increase reflects expanded work to integrate human-machine symbiosis technologies into a system for assessment. Title: Automated Knowledge Acquisition (AKA) Description: The Automated Knowledge Acquisition (AKA) program will develop technologies to automate the integration of diverse sources of data and information into a unified whole. A number of technologies now exist to extract, transform, and load diverse source data into a structured knowledge base. However, each time a new source of data is encountered, a human engineer is required to map that source's metadata and schema to the metadata and schema of the target knowledge base. Performing this mapping is difficult even when design documentation for the source is available, and so it represents a significant barrier to data interoperability and knowledge acquisition. AKA will leverage advances in semantic technology and machine learning to enable machines to perform the entire data integration function without human intervention. AKA technology will automatically learn the semantics of a new data source, characterize source content, align source schema to the target, transform and load values, and reconcile inconsistencies by learning from previously integrated sources. AKA technologies will- - 24.100 Volume 1 - 86 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602303E: INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 27 of 29 R-1 Line #13Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2020 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Date: March 2019 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / 2R-1 Program INFORMATION ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND HUMAN-MACHINE SYMBIOSIS B.

FY 2019 to FY 2020 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2020 increase reflects program initiation. Title: Accelerating Artificial Intelligence (AAI) Description: The Accelerating Artificial Intelligence (AAI) program seeks to go beyond commercially-driven advances in AI and address important national security challenge applications. In particular, this program is focused on improving DoD processes that, because of the need for excessive human involvement, create bottlenecks in DoD's ability to rapidly adapt and deploy new technologies and capabilities. If successful, research efforts under this program will significantly reduce the time and cost associated with many important developmental, approval and certification processes. One technical challenge to be addressed in this program is the need to assess current processes and identify tasks or sub-tasks amenable to minimal human intervention. Other challenges include the need to develop social context aware AI systems and to ensure robustness of AI systems. Approaches to addressing these challenges will leverage recent advances at the frontiers of AI research in transfer learning, causal reasoning and associated models. AAI application areas include the following: (1) machine-enabled techniques to reduce human engagement in determining trustworthiness and intent; (2) automated approaches for accreditation of military software systems; and (3) technologies to restore movement and sensation to central nervous system impaired patients. FY 2020 Plans: - Evaluate current approaches for assessing trustworthiness and identify tasks or sub-tasks amenable to minimal human intervention. - Apply AI to identify the most effective methods for assessing trustworthiness and intent as a function of social context. - Identify data sources for development and training of AI systems for machine assisted human interviews and vetting processes. - Develop, demonstrate, and evaluate pilot application using algorithmic game theory based AI techniques for complex military decision problems.

Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2018 FY 2019 FY 2020 The FY 2020 increase reflects program initiation. Title: Knowledge-directed AI Reasoning Over Schemas (KAIROS) Description: The Knowledge-directed Artificial Intelligence (AI) Reasoning over Schemas (KAIROS) program will develop AI and machine learning technologies to aid a human operator in understanding complex event sequences. For the purposes of KAIROS, an event is an occurrence that results in an observable and recognizable change in either the physical world or human society. Events of particular interest to KAIROS are those that create changes that have significant impact on national or homeland security. Many important events are not simple occurrences but complex phenomena that are composed of numerous subsidiary event elements, some of which happen simultaneously while others are sequential and dependent on each other. Humans make sense of event sequences by organizing them into narrative structures that may occur or re-occur frequently. These structures are abstracted into schemas - organized units of knowledge that represent patterns - for the purpose of cognition. The KAIROS program will develop automated systems that use existing schemas and, when needed, create new schemas to bring structure to complex event sequences and present these structured representations to operators. Given multi- media inputs, operators will use KAIROS technologies to identify subsidiary event elements, determine their temporal order, recognize complex event sequences, and link disparate events. KAIROS technologies will enable analysts and warfighters to understand unfolding events rapidly and accurately. FY 2020 Plans: - Develop and apply AI and statistical pattern recognition techniques for machine learning of new temporal schemas from intelligence data. - Develop temporal schema to recognize patterns in complex event sequences. - Develop techniques for quantifying the degree to which a temporal schema models a complex sequence of event elements and for quantifying the degree of confidence in reconstructions. - Explore approaches for using partial matches to temporal schema to interpolate or predict missing or future event elements, respectively. FY 2019 to FY 2020 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY Foundational and Applied Artificial Intelligence FY 2019 Plans: - Define temporal schemas for a broad range of event sequences including in particular events of potential interest to military decision makers.- 25.000 Volume 1 - 88 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602303E: INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 29 of 29 R-1 Line #13Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2020 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Date: March 2019 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / 2R-1 Program INFORMATION INTELLIGENCE AND HUMAN-MACHINE SYMBIOSIS FY 2018 FY 2019 - Formulate top-down approaches for associating events under analysis with existing temporal schemas. - Explore approaches that enable adaptation of natural language processing and computer vision technologies to chemistry data.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Tactical Technology Program Element is budgeted in the Applied Research Budget Activity because it supports the advancement of concepts and technologies to enhance the next generation of tactical systems. The Tactical Technology Program Element funds a number of projects in the areas of Naval Warfare, Advanced Land Systems, Aeronautics Technology and Information Analytics Technology. The Naval Warfare Technology project develops advanced technologies for application to a broad range of naval requirements. Enabling and novel technologies include concepts for expanding the envelope of operational naval capabilities such as improved situational awareness over large maritime environments, ship self-defense techniques, novel underwater propulsion modalities, high speed underwater vessels, improved techniques for underwater object detection and discrimination, long endurance unmanned surface vehicles, and high bandwidth communications. The Advanced Land Systems Technology project is developing technologies for enhancing U.S. military effectiveness and survivability in operations ranging from traditional threats to military operations against irregular forces that can employ disruptive or catastrophic capabilities, or disrupt stabilization operations.

Title: Mobile Force Protection (MFP) Description: The goal of the Mobile Force Protection (MFP) program is to develop and demonstrate an integrated system capable of defeating a raid of self-guided small unmanned aircraft (sUAS) attacking a high value convoy on the move. By focusing on protecting mobile assets, the program will emphasize low footprint solutions, in terms of size, weight, power (SWaP), and manning, which will benefit other counter UAS missions and result in more affordable systems. Defending in a variety of operating environments against these sUAS threats and associated concept of operations requires several breakthroughs in affordable technology to sense, decide and act on a compressed timeline while mitigating collateral damage. The program seeks to develop solutions applicable to the defense of mobile ground and naval forces that can also potentially defeat more conventional threats. The solution will be scalable and modular such that it can be deployed in multiple defense applications and does not become obsolete with evolving threat capability.30.500 37.000 19.000 Volume 1 - 101 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602702E: TACTICAL TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 8 of 26 R-1 Line #17Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2020 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Date: March 2019 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / TACTICAL (Number/Name) TT-04 / ADVANCED LAND SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY B.

Title: Rapunzel Description: Urban combat demands that riflemen also serve as combat engineers manipulating their local environment to gain tactical advantage. The urban environment creates unique challenges in providing solutions for mobility, counter-mobility, survivability, and concealment. Every pound that a warfighter wears or carries reduces their mobility and mission effectiveness, and, particularly in urban combat, reduced mobility paradoxically reduces their survivability. The Rapunzel program seeks to enable warfighters to manipulate the urban environment through the application of novel materials research. Rapunzel envisions soldier-borne or vehicle-borne utility-belt style packaged containers, reels, and spools of material that can perform urban engineering tasks such as create bridges between building rooftops, pull down enemy barriers, or provide false targets and concealment. The program will identify those mass-manufactured materials, such as extremely high-tensile strength monofilament that can both provide novel mobility between buildings but also provide novel counter-mobility to enemy vehicles due to their electrical conductance properties. The Rapunzel program will leverage extensive existing research into early developmental materials and invest in the task-based development and packing to provide these materials at appropriate length and size scales for immediate tactical use.

Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2018 FY 2019 FY 2020 Description: The Precision Kinetic Light Strike program sought to develop a small, lightweight, guided kinetic weapon for lightweight maneuver forces. Current short-range weapons are used against a variety of target sets using different munitions without the benefit of active guidance. Current long-range weapons are highly effective against a specific target set at range, but are too large or heavy to employ in needed numbers, have a high cost per shot/procurement cost, and often require burdensome logistics or dedicated specialized systems to use. The program goal was to improve on the existing, lightweight unguided munition systems by increasing range, accuracy, and lethality, while reducing cost. These improvements leveraged advances in miniaturization, precision guidance and warheads. Precision Kinetic Light Strike sought to take advantage of commercial technologies whenever possible to provide a low-cost, multi-use, and multi-function precision engagement capability. The Precision Kinetic Light Strike program will significantly increase the combat power of small units with reduced burden, while significantly reducing cost relative to near-peer and peer adversaries.

Title: Memex Description: The Memex program developed search technologies to revolutionize the discovery, organization, and presentation of domain-specific content. Earlier search technologies were limited in search query format, retrieved content organization, and infrastructure support, and they imposed an iterative search process that was time-consuming and inefficient, producing only a fraction of the available information. Memex created a new domain-specific search paradigm that discovers relevant content and organizes it in ways that are more immediately useful to specific missions and tasks. In addition, Memex domain-specific search engines extend the reach of current search capabilities to the deep web and non-traditional content. Memex technologies enable the military, government, and commercial enterprises to find and organize mission-critical information on the Internet and in large intelligence repositories. Mission areas addressed by Memex included counter-terrorism, counter-drug, anti-money-laundering, and anti-human-trafficking, with transition partners from DoD and other U.S. Government activities.5.000 - - Title: Network Defense Description: The Network Defense program developed technologies to detect network attacks. U.S. computer networks are continually under attack, and these attacks are typically handled by individual organizations as they occur. Analyzing network summary data across a wide array of networks can make it possible to identify trends and patterns visible only when the data is viewed as a whole. Network Defense developed novel algorithms and analysis tools that enable a big picture approach for identifying illicit behavior in networks. This analysis and subsequent feedback to system administrators, security engineers, and decision makers can enhance information security in both the government and commercial sectors.5.000 - - Accomplishments/Planned Programs Subtotals 119.843 104.610 103.584 C.

This project will therefore pursue potential electronics performance advancements that do not rely on Moore's Law but instead leverage circuit specialization, to include materials, architectures, and designs intended to suit a specific need. In addition, the Beyond Scaling Technology Project recognizes that the envisioned electronics specialization will require proper security safeguards. Electronics advancements must simultaneously make progress in performance and secure the foundation on which our digital infrastructure relies. Programs within the Beyond Scaling project will look at reducing barriers to making specialized circuits in today's silicon hardware and significantly increase the ease with which DoD can design, deliver, and eventually upgrade critical, customized electronics. Programs will also explore alternatives to traditional circuit architectures, Volume 1 - 137 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602716E: ELECTRONICS TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 2 of 23 R-1 Line #19Exhibit R-2 , RDT&E Budget Item Justification: PB 2020 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Date: March 2019 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide / BA 2: Applied ResearchR-1 Program Element (Number/Name) PE 0602716E / ELECTRONICS TECHNOLOGY for instance by exploiting vertical circuit integration to optimize electronic devices and by incorporating novel materials, and explore techniques for securing DoD and commercial data and hardware.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification Advances in microelectronic device technologies continue to significantly benefit improved weapons effectiveness, intelligence capabilities, and information superiority. The Electronic Technology project therefore supports continued advancement in microelectronics, including electronic and optoelectronic devices, Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS), semiconductor device design and fabrication, and new materials and material structures. Particular focuses of this work include reducing the barriers to designing and fabricating custom electronics and exploiting improved manufacturing techniques to provide low-cost, high-performance sensors. Programs in this project will also greatly improve the size, weight, power, and performance characteristics of electronic systems; support positioning, navigation, and timing in GPS-denied environments; and develop sensors more sensitive and robust than today's standards. The Electronic Technology project will also investigate the feasibility, design, and development of powerful devices, including non-silicon-based materials technologies to achieve low-cost, reliable, fast, and secure computing, communication, and storage systems. Rapid design and utilization of these new technologies will be a critical focus of ELT-01, as DoD looks for mechanisms to speed the development and fielding of advanced technologies. This project has six major focus areas: Electronics, Photonics, MicroElectroMechanical Systems, Architectures, Algorithms, and other Electronic Technology research. B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2018 FY 2019 FY 2020 Title: High power Amplifier using Vacuum electronics for Overmatch Capability (HAVOC) Description: The High power Amplifier using Vacuum electronics for Overmatch Capability (HAVOC) program seeks to develop compact Radio Frequency (RF) signal amplifiers for air, ground, and ship-based communications and sensing systems. HAVOC amplifiers would enable these systems to access the high-frequency millimeter-wave portion of the Electromagnetic (EM) spectrum, facilitating increased range and other performance improvements. Today, the effectiveness of combat operations across all domains increasingly depends on DoD's ability to control and exploit the EM spectrum and to deny its use to adversaries. However, the proliferation of inexpensive commercial RF sources has made the EM spectrum crowded and contested, challenging our spectrum dominance. Operating at higher frequencies, such as the millimeter-wave, helps DoD to overcome these issues and offers numerous tactical advantages such as high data-rate communications and high resolution and sensitivity for radar and sensors. Opportunities for transferring HAVOC technology to the Services will be identified during the execution of the early phases of the program. Technology transfer efforts will follow a spiral development process to mitigate risk and provide the opportunity to incorporate new technological developments as they occur. Basic research for this program is funded within PE 0601101E, Project ES-01.

FY 2019 to FY 2020 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2020 decrease reflects the program transitioning from fabrication and testing of devices to transition. Title: Precise Robust Inertial Guidance for Munitions (PRIGM) Description: The Precise Robust Inertial Guidance for Munitions (PRIGM) program aims to develop inertial sensor technologies for positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) in GPS-denied environments. When GPS is not available, these inertial sensors can provide autonomous PNT information. The program will exploit recent advances in integrating photonic (light-manipulating) components into electronics and in employing Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) as high-performance inertial sensors for use in extreme environments. Whereas conventional MEMS inertial sensors can suffer from inaccuracies due to factors such as temperature sensitivity, new photonics-based PNT techniques have demonstrated the ability to mitigate these inaccuracies. PRIGM will focus on two areas. By 2020, it aims to develop and transition a Navigation-Grade Inertial Measurement Unit (NGIMU), a state-of-the-art MEMS device, to DoD platforms. By 2030, it aims to develop Advanced Inertial MEMS Sensors (AIMS) that can provide gun-hard, high-bandwidth, high dynamic range navigation for GPS-free munitions. These advances should enable navigation applications, such as smart munitions, that require low-cost, size, weight, and power inertial sensors with high bandwidth, precision, and shock tolerance. PRIGM will advance state-of-the-art MEMS gyros from TRL-3 devices to a TRL-6 transition platform, eventually enabling the Service Labs to perform TRL-7 field demonstrations. Basic research for this program is funded within PE 0601101E, Project ES-01 and advanced technology development for the program is budgeted in PE 0603739E, Project MT-15. FY 2019 Plans: - Demonstrate 100x increase in frequency stability and 3x reduction in power consumption in MEMS clock oscillators. - Package all component technology and test photonic-MEMS inertial sensor performance, robustness to environmental temperature variation, and repeatability between routine operations. FY 2020 Plans: - Demonstrate inertial sensor survival and operation through laboratory-representative launch events.

Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2018 FY 2019 FY 2020 The decrease in FY 2020 reflects completion of design to transition of packaging component technology and testing inertial sensor performance. Title: Wafer-scale Infrared Detectors (WIRED) Description: The WIRED program addresses the need for low-cost, high-performance imaging sensors in the short-wave and mid-wave infrared (SWIR/MWIR) bands. These sensors will provide increased standoff distances for small unmanned aerial vehicles, low-cost missiles, handheld weapon sights and surveillance systems, helmet-mounted systems, and ground-vehicle- mounted threat warning systems. WIRED proposes to manufacture these sensors at the wafer scale, which reduces costs by processing dozens to hundreds of camera imaging arrays at a time. Wafer-scale manufacturing has already driven a revolution in optical imaging in both the visible and the Long-Wave Infrared (LWIR) spectrum, with high-resolution digital cameras and LWIR sensors having become commonplace or widely-available. However, no similar technologies exist for the SWIR/MWIR bands. WIRED could therefore drive a similar revolution in SWIR/MWIR. The program aims to significantly reduce the weight and volume of MWIR detectors, which today require heavy cryogenic cooling systems, and increase the resolution of SWIR detectors by dramatically reducing their pixel size relative to the state-of-the-art. FY 2019 Plans: - Demonstrate an integrated MWIR camera and evaluate performance at temperature of 270 K. - Demonstrate an integrated small-pitch SWIR camera and optimize design of high-resolution SWIR camera. FY 2020 Plans: - Demonstrate improved performance of a both the MWIR and SWIR cameras. FY 2019 to FY 2020 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2020 decrease reflects the program transitioning to final demonstrations.19.000 15.000 7.682 Title: Modular Optical Aperture Building The Modular Optical Aperture Building Blocks (MOABB) program aims to greatly improve the cost, size, weight, and performance of free-space optical systems. These systems enable applications such as Light Detection And Ranging (LIDAR), laser communications, laser illumination, navigation, and 3D imaging. Specifically, MOABB will construct millimeter-scale optical building blocks that can be coherently arrayed to form larger, higher power devices. These building blocks would replace the traditional large and expensive precision lenses and mirrors, which require slow mechanical steering, that form conventional optical systems. MOABB will develop scalable optical phased arrays that can steer light waves without the use of mechanical components. These advances would allow for a 100-fold reduction in size and weight and a 1,000-fold increase in the steering rate of optical systems.

Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2018 FY 2019 FY 2020 - Demonstrate frequency modulated LIDAR functionality of a unit cell. - Improve the aperture size, output power, field of regard, and efficiency of optical phased array transmitters. - Co-package optical phased arrays with chip-scale laser sources. FY 2020 Plans: - Synthesize multiple light beams from a single optical phased array aperture of one square centimeter area. - Demonstrate integration of laser sources and optical phased arrays on a single photonic chip. - Characterize and deliver a prototype LIDAR module using optical phased arrays. Title: Atomic Clock with Enhanced Stability (ACES) Description: The Atomic Clock with Enhanced Stability (ACES) program aims to develop extremely stable chip-scale atomic clocks for unmanned aerial vehicles and other low size, weight, and power (SWaP) platforms with extended mission durations. Atomic clocks provide the high-performance backbone of timing and synchronization for DoD navigation; communications; electronic warfare (EW); and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) systems. However, atomic clocks are limited, particularly by temperature sensitivity, aging over long timescales, and a loss of accuracy when power cycled. By employing alternative approaches to confining and measuring atomic particles, ACES could yield a 100x - 1,000x improvement in key performance parameters related to each of these limitations. ACES will also focus on developing the component technologies necessary for low-cost manufacturing and for deployment in harsh DoD-relevant environments. Among its many benefits, program success could help reduce the risk posed by a growing national dependence on GPS, allowing systems to maintain their timing accuracy in the event of temporary GPS unavailability. FY 2019 Plans: - Complete fabrication and testing of an integrated physics package meeting the ACES Phase 2 SWaP, retrace, aging, and instability goals. - Deliver prototype physics package and supporting electronics to government facility for testing. FY 2020 Plans: - Design an integrated physics package meeting Phase 3 SWaP objectives such that prototypes can be completed and tested. FY 2019 to FY 2020 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2020 decrease reflects ACES completing fabrication and conducting final testing for transition to the Service Labs for further development.21.000 16.000 6.000 Title: Limits of Thermal Sensors (LOTS) Description: The Limits of Thermal Sensors (LOTS) program aims to demonstrate long-wave infrared (LWIR) detector technologies with both high performance and low-size, weight, power, and cost (SWaP-C).

Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2018 FY 2019 FY 2020 enable improvements in imaging systems such as night-vision goggles, infrared-guided missiles, and missile threat warning systems. Currently, LWIR-enabled systems must choose between large and expensive cryogenically-cooled detectors, which offer high sensitivity and low response times, and uncooled detectors called microbolometers, which offer significant SWaP- C reductions at lower performance. LOTS seeks to develop microbolometers that can compete with larger cameras in terms of higher sensitivity required to detect signals over long ranges and lower response time required to avoid image blur. These technologies will allow DoD to deploy smaller, lighter, and cheaper sensors on critical, high-value assets while maintaining or improving their ability to engage fast-moving or distant targets. FY 2019 Plans: - Build LWIR cameras with refined sensors to meet final program specifications. - Validate test camera sensitivity and response time in a relevant application environment. FY 2020 Plans: - Validate improved robustness of the test camera in response to relevant radiation conditions. FY 2019 to FY 2020 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2020 decrease reflects the program transitioning from refining sensors to validating test camera hardening performance. Title: Atomic Magnetometry for Biological Imaging In Earth's Native Terrain (AMBIIENT) Description: The Atomic Magnetometry for Biological Imaging In Earth's Native Terrain (AMBIIENT) program will develop novel magnetic sensors capable of providing high-sensitivity signal measurements in the presence of ambient magnetic fields. In recent years, the value of magnetic imaging, for example for cardiac and other biological signals, has shown tremendous potential for advanced research and clinical diagnosis. Practical application, however, has been limited. Interference from natural and manmade ambient magnetic fields has required that the measurements be performed in specialized, magnetically-shielded research facilities. The AMBIIENT program will exploit novel physical architectures that are resistant to the impact of common noise sources. The AMBIIENT sensor itself must be able to detect the gradient of a local magnetic field while subtracting the much larger ambient signal. This would enable low-cost, portable, high-sensitivity measurements for in-the-field applications. In addition to medical research and clinical diagnosis, AMBIIENT sensors promise to enable diverse sensing applications including magnetic gradient navigation, anomaly detection, perimeter monitoring, and Ultralow Frequency (ULF) communications. FY 2019 Plans: - Fabricate and test preliminary architectures for direct gradient sensing of magnetic fields. - Refine quantitative models of gradient sensor physics.12.000 11.540 14.000 Volume 1 - 143 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602716E: ELECTRONICS TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 8 of 23 R-1 Line #19Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2020 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Date: March 2019 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / (Number/Name) ELT-01 / ELECTRONIC B.

FY 2020 Plans: - Design sensor package architecture meeting AMBIIENT Phase 2 size weight and power, accuracy, and sensitivity goals. - Fabricate and test Phase 2 architectures for direct gradient sensing of magnetic fields. FY 2019 to FY 2020 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2020 increase reflects a shift from initial testing to sensor package architecture fabrication. Title: Dynamic Range-enhanced Electronics and Materials (DREaM) Description: The Dynamic Range-enhanced Electronics and Materials (DREaM) program aims to develop intrinsically linear (ideal) radio frequency (RF) transistors with improved power efficiency and extremely high dynamic range. Linearity, power efficiency, and dynamic range are fundamental characteristics that allow RF systems to reliably transmit clear signals. Improving these characteristics is essential to operating in a crowded RF environment and to enabling next-generation communication, sensing, and electronic warfare systems. Traditional RF transistor designs typically require a trade-off between linearity and broadcast power, and poor linearity results in undesired interference. DREAM will overcome this tradeoff by employing new transistor materials, architectures, and designs. The resulting DREAM-enabled technologies will allow future RF electronics to increase their operating range without polluting the already-congested RF spectrum and while consuming less system power. FY 2019 Plans: - Develop initial low noise and lower power consumption linear transistor prototype that provides 10 times improvement of linearity figure of merit than the state of the art. - Demonstrate fabrication processes for initial advanced transistor architectures and complete early characterization of RF transistor prototypes with two times improvement in output power over the state of the art. FY 2020 Plans: - Manufacture and characterize transistor unit cells with both a three times improvement over the state of the art in output power density and 10 times higher linearity. - Optimize fabrication processes and explore novel transistor topology to enable higher breakdown voltage, for design of transistors with four times higher power density than the state of the art. - Exploit new channel materials and perform device modeling to enable scaling to 30 times higher linearity than state of the art at 30 gigahertz operational frequency.

Title: Wideband Secured and Protected Emitter and Receiver (WiSPER)* Description: *formerly Ensured Communication Link for Identification Friend or Foe (ECLIFF) The Wideband Secured and Protected Emitter and Receiver (WiSPER) program aims to develop an ultra-broadband technology platform to demonstrate a robust, secure and protected communication link. WiSPER technology provides high signal coding gain to deliver a secured and protected link with significantly enhanced capacity for next generation DoD communications. Current terrestrial tactical radios operate with limited bandwidth at prescribed low frequency bands, which are unable to support high capacity with multiple users, and vulnerable to interference and jamming. WISPER technology addresses military needs for assured communications, electronic warfare (EW) communications deception, throughput, security, and size, weight, and power (SWaP) limitations of future C4ISR missions. The program develops an ultra-broadband compact antenna, radio frequency front end electronics, mixed signal circuits, and featureless waveform technologies. The WiSPER program will culminate with the integration and demonstration of a secured communication link. The WiSPER program moved from ELT-02, Beyond Scaling Technologies, in FY 2019. FY 2019 Plans: - Complete system study of secured transceiver architecture for ultra-broadband communication links. - Begin initial designs of antenna, integrated circuits, and waveform to implement ultra-broadband communications.

Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2018 FY 2019 FY 2020 development activities will leverage recent advances in low power, application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) electronics and low power sensors from the internet of things (IoT) community to increase the functionality of microrobotic platforms while increasing platform mobility, maneuverability, and dexterity. The microrobotic platform capabilities enabled by SHRIMP will provide the DoD with significantly more access and capability to operate in small spaces that are practically inaccessible to today's state- of-the-art robotic platforms. Such capability will have impact in search and rescue, disaster relief, infrastructure inspection, and equipment maintenance, among other operations. Foundational research efforts are funded in PE 0601101E, Project ES-01. FY 2019 Plans: - Initiate development of tethered microrobotic platforms with emphasis on program metrics for size, weight, and duration of operation. FY 2020 Plans: - Demonstrate tethered microrobotic platforms meeting program metrics on size, weight, and duration of operation. - Initiate development of an untethered microrobotic platform with an emphasis on size, weight, and performance. FY 2019 to FY 2020 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2020 increase reflects the program shifting from initial development to demonstration of tethered microrobotic platforms. Title: Intelligent Spectroscopic & Temporal Fusion (INSPECT) Description: The Intelligent Spectroscopic & Temporal Fusion (INSPECT) program will add relevant spectral content to broadband infrared (IR) imagers to enhance battlefield detection and discrimination while maintaining situational awareness. The resulting desired capability is analogous to human vision that relies upon shape, brightness, and color to recognize and identify objects of interest. Currently fielded systems are either broadband infrared sensors that rely on shape and brightness to identify targets or hyperspectral sensors that rely on color to identify targets. INSPECT will (1) leverage read-out integrated circuits currently in development combined with advances in electrically tunable optical filters and micro-optical components to demonstrate hardware that simultaneously provides situational awareness and target spectral characteristics, and (2) develop intelligent processing for mission-specific band selection. This will enable new applications in passive seeker technology for missiles, battlefield chemical sensing, laser weapon identification and protection, and low probability of detection multi-spectral optical communications. FY 2020 Plans: - Develop preliminary architecture for use with existing broadband imaging hardware. - Develop preliminary algorithms that provide intelligent band selection. - Begin initial design integration using INSPECT framework.

Today's multi-function phased arrays that cover broad bandwidth are open to all frequencies with little or no RF filtering. This is due to a lack of reconfigurable filtering that is small enough to integrate into the arrays, limiting the use of wideband multi- function arrays in contested environments. The ability to create reconfigurable bandpass and bandstop filters in the range of 2-18 GHz will be important to implementing transmit/receive modules in next generation multi-function arrays. Another important area of interference mitigation is self-interference. Specifically, in electronic warfare, it would be advantageous to be able to listen while jamming. Instinctual RF will develop the signal cancellation devices that will listen to the transmit signal and subtract the interfering signal from the input of the receiver so that it will be able to hear faint signals near the noise floor. Instinctual RF research will provide feedback mechanisms that instinctively correct these problems, much like the nerves of the human body serve to trigger protective action without conscious thought. Whether for self-induced interference or external interference jamming, this program will show the ability to auto-correct and allow for continued operation. FY 2020 Plans: - Demonstrate new materials, devices and/or circuit architectures that will enable frequency tuning of band pass and band stop filters in chip-scale size for use in next generation multi-function phased arrays. - Demonstrate new materials, devices and/or circuit architectures that will enable cancellation of signal leakage between two adjacent antennas for electronic warfare applications on small platforms.

Frequency synthesis and accurate control of radiofrequency and microwave radiation is the enabling technology for radar, satellite and terrestrial communications, positioning and navigation technology, and many other core DoD capabilities. Frequency synthesis and control of light or optical waves, however, has been constrained to laboratory experiments due to the size, fragility, and cost of optical frequency synthesizers. DODOS will leverage recent developments in the field of integrated photonics to enable the development of a ubiquitous, low-cost optical frequency synthesizers. The program could lead to disruptive DoD capabilities, including high-bandwidth optical communications, higher performance Light Detection And Ranging13.000 3.000 - Volume 1 - 147 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602716E: ELECTRONICS TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 12 of 23 R-1 Line #19Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2020 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Date: March 2019 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / (Number/Name) ELT-01 / ELECTRONIC B.

FY 2019 to FY 2020 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2020 decrease reflects program completion. Title: Common Heterogeneous integration & IP reuse Strategies (CHIPS) Description: The Common Heterogeneous integration & IP reuse Strategies (CHIPS) program aims to develop the design tools and integration standards required to better leverage leading-edge commercial sector technologies in DoD systems. The program aims to realize modular Integrated Circuits (ICs) that integrate designs using different commercial suppliers and silicon technologies. CHIPS will therefore pursue standardized interfaces for integrating a variety of Intellectual Property (IP) blocks in the form of prefabricated chiplets. The chiplets could be reused across applications, manufacturers, and transistor types, allowing DoD to amortize IC design costs across programs, better align electronics design and fabrication with military performance goals, and expand beyond its traditional reliance on the proprietary capabilities of a few on-shore manufacturers. The CHIPS program moves to Project ELT-02, Beyond Scaling Technologies, in FY 2019.28.250 - - Title: Near Zero Energy RF and Sensor Operations (N-ZERO) Description: The Near Zero Power RF and Sensor Operations (N-ZERO) program will develop and demonstrate the technologies required to extend the lifetimes of remotely-deployed sensors from months to years. Today's state-of-the-art sensors can be pre-placed and remain dormant until awoken by an external trigger or stimulus. However, the active electronics that monitor for external triggers consume power, limiting sensor lifetimes to between weeks and months. N-ZERO seeks to replace these electronics with passive or extremely low-power devices that continuously monitor the environment and wake up active electronics upon detection of a specific trigger. This would eliminate or significantly reduce standby power consumption, ensuring that sensor lifetimes are limited only by the power required to process and communicate confirmed events. In doing so, N-ZERO could enable wireless sensors with drastically increased mission life and help meet DoD's unfulfilled need for a persistent, event-driven sensing capability. N-ZERO's applied research component will focus on developing radio frequency (RF) communications and physical sensor systems that use energy from an external trigger to collect, process, and detect useful information while rejecting spurious signals and noise.

Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2018 FY 2019 FY 2020 Title: Circuit Realization At Faster Timescales (CRAFT) Description: The Circuit Realization At Faster Timescales (CRAFT) program will develop novel integrated circuit (IC) design flows to reduce by ten times the design and verification effort required for high-performance military electronics. CRAFT will also reduce barriers to the design and fabrication of custom ICs in leading-edge complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology. When selecting electronics for advanced systems, DoD currently must choose between high-performing custom ICs that take years to design and verify or significantly lower-performing general purpose ICs that can be implemented in a few months. The need to protect sensitive IC information further limits DoD's ability to access certain leading-edge commercial electronics. To reduce the design and verification effort, CRAFT will investigate and leverage novel design flows that utilize recent advances in electronic design automation and software design methodologies. These design flows could reduce the manual labor required to develop and verify custom ICs. CRAFT will also explore increased design reuse and flexibility, which will allow DoD to migrate chip fabrication between different foundries or to more advanced technology nodes. These capabilities can help to ensure that the DoD has multiple potential suppliers for critical ICs and help keep military electronics at the leading edge.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Beyond Scaling Technology project recognizes that, within the next decade, the continuous pace of improvements in electronics performance will face the fundamental limits of silicon technology. These limits present a barrier that must be overcome in order for progress to continue. This project will therefore pursue potential electronics performance advancements that do not rely on Moore's Law but instead leverage circuit specialization, to include materials, architectures, and designs intended to suit a specific need. In addition, the Beyond Scaling Technology Project recognizes that the envisioned electronics specialization will require proper security safeguards. Electronics advancements must simultaneously make progress in performance and secure the foundation on which our digital infrastructure relies. Programs within the Beyond Scaling project will look at reducing barriers to making specialized circuits in today's silicon hardware and significantly increase the ease with which DoD can design, deliver, and eventually upgrade critical, customized electronics. Programs will also explore alternatives to traditional circuit architectures, for instance by exploiting vertical circuit integration to optimize electronic devices and by incorporating novel materials, and explore techniques for securing DoD and commercial data and hardware. This project aggregates and continues Beyond Scaling programs that were initiated in PEs/Projects 0602716E/ELT-01 and 0602303E/ IT-02 and IT-03. B.

Title: Common Heterogeneous integration & IP reuse Strategies (CHIPS) Description: The Common Heterogeneous integration & IP reuse Strategies (CHIPS) program aims to develop the design tools and integration standards required to better leverage leading-edge commercial sector technologies in DoD systems. The program aims to realize modular Integrated Circuits (ICs) that integrate designs using different commercial suppliers and silicon technologies. CHIPS will therefore pursue standardized interfaces for integrating a variety of Intellectual Property (IP) blocks in the form of prefabricated chiplets. The chiplets could be reused across applications, manufacturers, and transistor types, allowing DoD to amortize IC design costs across programs, better align electronics design and fabrication with military performance goals, and expand beyond its traditional reliance on the proprietary capabilities of a few on-shore manufacturers.

Title: System Security Integrated Through Hardware and firmware (SSITH) Description: The System Security Integrated Through Hardware and firmware (SSITH) program seeks to secure DoD and commercial electronic systems against cybersecurity threats by developing novel hardware/firmware security architectures and hardware design methodologies. Current responses to cybersecurity attacks typically consist of developing and deploying software patches to address specific vulnerabilities in a software firewall without addressing potential vulnerabilities in the underlying hardware architecture. To address this challenge, SSITH will drive new research in electronics hardware security and exploit current research in areas such as cryptographic-based computing and hardware verification. Implementation of these advanced ideas has been enabled by the extremely capable semiconductor technology driven by Moore's Law. The program will also investigate flexible hardware architectures that adapt to and limit the impact of new cybersecurity attacks. Finally, SSITH will seek to mitigate the potential negative impact of new security protection architectures on system performance and power usage. Once developed, SSITH capabilities will be applicable to both commercial and military electronic systems. The SSITH program moved from Project IT-03, Information Assurance and Survivability, in FY 2019. FY 2019 Plans: - Implement new hardware architectures on Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) demonstration platforms that demonstrate scalable, flexible, and robust protection against external attacks on embedded and mobile processing hardware. - Utilize simulation and hardware emulation to confirm the expected improvement in protection of the new hardware architectures relative to current software only protection. - Evaluate SSITH security approaches through independent Red Team attack on the security architectures as implemented on FPGA hardware.

FY 2019 to FY 2020 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2020 decrease reflects the program transitioning from implementing hardware design to testing hardware. Title: Hierarchical Identify Verify Exploit (HIVE) Description: The Hierarchical Identify Verify Exploit (HIVE) program will pursue new hardware architectures and algorithms for improving the efficiency of graph and sparse data analytics. When developing operationally significant intelligence, human analysts today are forced to reduce the scope of the problems that they can address and the tempo of their analyses due to the limitations of currently deployed hardware. Because of these limitations the amount of information gathered is quickly outstripping the human ability to review, process, fuse, and interpret. To resolve this challenge, HIVE seeks to leverage improvements in computational efficiency to augment the analyst's ability to integrate large streams of data. The program will investigate advances in chip architecture and data analytics algorithms that can allow machines to infer meaning out of data based on the information needs of the warfighter. Program success would therefore enable the warfighter to understand far more of the battlespace in real time. The HIVE program moved from Project IT-02, High Productivity, High Performance Responsive Architectures, in FY 2019. FY 2019 Plans: - Improve the toolsets based on information gathered from previous testing and deliver a beta version of the software. - Expand the code sets and code set analysis for final detailed power and performance analysis. - Develop initial full architectural design and detailed performance analysis to drive final design decisions. - Demonstrate that HIVE can run DoD problem sets on field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) which emulate the HIVE chip and measure both power and performance improvements of the proposed architectures. FY 2020 Plans: - Complete development of the FPGA emulator and porting of government workflows. - Finalize the HIVE chip architecture and deliver design for fabrication. - Complete application programming interface for HIVE runtime environment.

Title: Digital develop a large-scale, interactive, emulated radiofrequency (RF) environment, providing the DoD with much needed capability to cost-effectively evaluate adaptive, intelligent, and spatially distributed next-generation RF systems. Current U.S. test infrastructure is no longer able to successfully exercise RF systems in relevant environments, which should account for hundreds of DoD systems coordinating against hundreds of adversary systems. Due to the critical dependency of nearly all platforms and missions on the RF spectrum and the increasingly advanced RF capabilities of peer adversaries, current infrastructure limitations represent a critical capability gap. Existing test approaches are either: 1) small-scale laboratory tests under well controlled but unrealistic conditions or 2) massive training exercises, which occur at most annually due to the required cost and manpower and do not fully collect necessary data. To overcome these limitations, DRBE will leverage advances in massively multi-core computing hardware and high-bandwidth digital cross connects to emulate realistic RF environments that account for RF platform movement, signal propagation effects and delays, signal interference, and interactions between RF systems. The electronics architecture which supports these goals is beyond anything that exists today, based on the power and latency requirements that this emulation environment demands. DRBE will pursue three technical thrust areas: architecture, massively multi-core computing, and scenario modeling. The resulting test environment should allow plug-and-play connections for hundreds of RF systems in a 100 km battlespace test. Multi-system exercises could then be quickly executed through many different combat scenarios and variations. DRBE should therefore serve to develop CONOPS, inform battle plans, and fine-tune the performance of both individual and large groups of RF systems. FY 2019 Plans: - Conduct architecture scaling analysis to define a solution supporting hundreds of RF systems. - Demonstrate basic physical building blocks that will be able to handle the immense throughput expected. FY 2020 Plans: - Complete first-generation DRBE system design. - Emulate first-generation DRBE system performance using non-real-time software. - Begin fabrication of a first-generation DRBE system. - Begin development and testing of second-generation DRBE basic physical building blocks. FY 2019 to FY 2020 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2020 increase reflects the program shifting from design to beginning fabrication of the DRBE system.- 8.000 15.000 Title: Circuit Realization At Faster Timescales (CRAFT) - 9.400 - Volume 1 - 157 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602716E: ELECTRONICS TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 22 of 23 R-1 Line #19Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2020 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Date: March 2019 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / (Number/Name) ELT-02 / BEYOND SCALING TECHNOLOGY B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2018 FY 2019 FY 2020 Description: The Circuit Realization At Faster Timescales (CRAFT) program will develop novel integrated circuit (IC) design flows to reduce by ten times the design and verification effort required for high-performance military electronics. CRAFT will also reduce barriers to the design and fabrication of custom ICs in leading-edge complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology. When selecting electronics for advanced systems, DoD currently must choose between high-performing custom ICs that take years to design and verify or significantly lower-performing general purpose ICs that can be implemented in a few months. The need to protect sensitive IC information further limits DoD's ability to access certain leading-edge commercial electronics. To reduce the design and verification effort, CRAFT will investigate and leverage novel design flows that utilize recent advances in electronic design automation and software design methodologies. These design flows could reduce the manual labor required to develop and verify custom ICs. CRAFT will also explore increased design reuse and flexibility, which will allow DoD to migrate chip fabrication between different foundries or to more advanced technology nodes. The CRAFT program moved from Project ELT-01, Electronic Technology, in FY 2019. FY 2019 Plans: - Complete the fourth multi-project wafer shuttle run utilizing the final CRAFT design flows. - Finalize the design vault to facilitate access to the CRAFT design flow and related IP for DoD use. - Utilize design flow and intellectual property (IP) from CRAFT to complete DoD reference designs. FY 2019 to FY 2020 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2020 decrease reflects program completion. Title: Near Zero Energy RF and Sensor Operations (N-ZERO) Description: The Near Zero Power RF and Sensor Operations (N-ZERO) program will develop and demonstrate the technologies required to extend the lifetimes of remotely-deployed sensors from months to years. Today's state-of-the-art sensors can be pre-placed and remain dormant until awoken by an external trigger or stimulus. However, the active electronics that monitor for external triggers consume power, limiting sensor lifetimes to between weeks and months. N-ZERO seeks to replace these electronics with passive or extremely low-power devices that continuously monitor the environment and wake up active electronics upon detection of a specific trigger. This would eliminate or significantly reduce standby power consumption, ensuring that sensor lifetimes are limited only by the power required to process and communicate confirmed events. In doing so, N-ZERO could enable wireless sensors with drastically increased mission life and help meet DoD's unfulfilled need for a persistent, event-driven sensing capability. N-ZERO's applied research component will focus on developing radio frequency (RF) communications and physical sensor systems that use energy from an external trigger to collect, process, and detect useful information while rejecting spurious signals and noise. A basic research component is budgeted under PE 0601101E, Project ES-01. The N-ZERO program moved from Project ELT-01, Electronics Technology, in FY 2019.- 10.000 - Volume 1 - 158 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602716E: ELECTRONICS TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 23 of 23 R-1 Line #19Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2020 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Date: March 2019 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / (Number/Name) ELT-02 / BEYOND SCALING TECHNOLOGY B.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Space Programs and Technology program element is budgeted in the Advanced Technology Development budget activity because it addresses high payoff opportunities to dramatically reduce costs associated with advanced space systems and provides revolutionary new system capabilities for satisfying current and projected military missions. A space force structure that is robust against attack represents a stabilizing deterrent against adversary attacks on space assets. This program element will examine concepts and architectures that move the U.S. away from a dependence on monolithic, ultra-capable, vulnerable, and unsustainably costly assets; replacing them with disaggregated assets that are agile, affordable, and easily replaced/maintained. Ready access to space requires the delivery of capabilities, replenishment of supplies into orbit, and rapid manufacturing of affordable space capabilities. Development of smaller, simpler, and more agile launch vehicles and infrastructure will be pursued. In addition, developing space access and spacecraft servicing technologies as well as exploring novel in-space manufacturing technologies and techniques will lead to reduced ownership costs of space systems and new opportunities for introducing technologies for the exploitation of space. Systems development is also required to increase the interactivity and functionality of space systems, space-derived information, and services with terrestrial users. Studies under this program element include technologies and systems that will enable satellites and microsatellites to operate more effectively by increasing maneuverability, survivability, and situational awareness, and precision control of multi-payload systems. Studies will actively seek to take advantage of new commercial developments which may enable both rapid constitution/reconstitution of assets, and agility/functionality not previously available for military systems.

Title: DARPA Launch Challenge* Description: *Previously Responsive Access for Space Resilience Advances in technology, including networking and computing, have significantly increased the utility of small (<300kg) spacecraft that would previously have been of limited military value. For the simultaneous purposes of responsiveness and resiliency, these spacecraft are envisioned to be built on dramatically faster timelines (weeks instead of years) than are executed today. The current practice for space launch generally favors large launch vehicles with complex, one-of-a-kind infrastructure. This architecture has been matched to the large, heavy spacecraft, which compose most of DoD's space architecture today. Small spacecraft, which offer large potential value for resiliency and tactical employment, are typically required to rideshare for access to space which requires programmatic, technical, and schedule entanglement with other programs. The U.S. commercial sector has promising developments for small launch vehicles that are designed for launch on rapid timescales with minimal fixed infrastructure. To incentivize industry to deliver capability that can meet emerging DoD needs for rapid, responsive launch of small payloads, the DARPA Launch Challenge will reward competitors who can demonstrate the ability to launch a payload to orbit with minimal notification time and unknown pre-conditions regarding the payload configuration, required orbit, and launch site. The U.S. Government can make future use of commercial contracting mechanisms for rapid space launch with successful performers. The anticipated transition partners are the Air Force and NASA. FY 2019 Plans: - Select launch ranges and initiate launch site facility accommodations, as necessary. - Develop and test multi-launch site compatible downrange telemetry return capabilities. - Create scalable commercial payload packages to support range of launch capabilities. - Coordinate with the FAA's Office of Commercial Space Transportation on license applications for challenge participants.- 5.000 38.500 Volume 1 - 176 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0603287E: SPACE PROGRAMS AND TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 7 of 9 R-1 Line #34Exhibit R-2 , RDT&E Budget Item Justification: PB 2020 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Date: March 2019 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide / BA 3: Advanced Technology Development (ATD)R-1 Program Element (Number/Name) PE 0603287E / SPACE PROGRAMS AND TECHNOLOGY C.

Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2018 FY 2019 FY 2020 Title: Precise Robust Inertial Guidance for Munitions (PRIGM) Description: The Precise Robust Inertial Guidance for Munitions (PRIGM) program aims to develop inertial sensor technologies for positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) in GPS-denied environments. These inertial sensors can provide autonomous PNT information when GPS is unavailable. The program will exploit recent advances in integrating photonic (light-manipulating) components into electronics and in employing microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) as high-performance inertial sensors for use in extreme environments. Whereas conventional MEMS inertial sensors suffer from inaccuracies due to factors such as temperature sensitivity, photonics-based PNT techniques have demonstrated the ability to mitigate these inaccuracies. PRIGM will focus on two areas: (1) By 2020, it aims to develop and transition a Navigation-Grade Inertial Measurement Unit (NGIMU), a state-of-the-art MEMS device, to DoD platforms; and (2) By 2030, it aims to develop Advanced Inertial MEMS Sensors (AIMS) that can provide gun-hard, high-bandwidth, high dynamic range navigation for GPS-free munitions. These advances should enable navigation applications, such as smart munitions, that require low-cost, size, weight, and power (SWaP) inertial sensors with high bandwidth, precision and shock tolerance. PRIGM will advance state-of-the-art MEMS gyros from TRL-3 devices to a TRL-6 transition platform, eventually enabling the Service Laboratories to perform TRL-7 field demonstrations. The ultimate goal is to develop a complete MEMS-based NGIMU with a mechanical/electronic interface identical to existing DoD-standard tactical- grade MEMS IMUs, providing a drop-in replacement for existing DoD systems. Service laboratories have been actively involved throughout program development and remain engaged to facilitate transition of NGIMU prototypes, which will be delivered at the program conclusion. This program has basic research efforts funded in PE 0601101E, Project ES-01 and applied research efforts Project ELT-01.

FY 2019 to FY 2020 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2020 decrease reflects a transition from development to completion and characterization of IMU prototypes. Title: Reconfigurable Imaging (ReImagine) Description: The Reconfigurable Imaging (ReImagine) program aims to create multi-functional readout integrated circuits (ROICs) that fundamentally change the way camera systems collect, process and relay image information. This is accomplished by adding multifunctional flexibility in the ROIC. Today, most cameras are designed to capture high quality imagery at standard frame rates. These traditional camera architectures collect a single type of data across the full image frame. Specialty cameras can be used to capture different spatial, spectral or temporal data but are rarely deployed because of the cost and complexity of adding imaging subsystems for niche measurements. Although these measurements are typically only desired for specific features or regions of interest (ROIs) in a scene, the cameras collect the specialized data over the full image frame. The ReImagine architecture, conversely, would enable a single, real-time reconfigurable, software-defined camera system with the ability to collect different data in different ROIs. Depending on the need, a ReImagine imager would be able to selectively collect and simultaneously process data from a specific ROI, for example, at a higher resolution (i.e., foveated imaging), at a higher frame rate or with 3-D depth information. The system would interface with virtually any sensor and could therefore be used in any spectral band. By demonstrating more efficient data collection and computation across ROIs, ReImagine ROICs should enable real-time analysis of much more complex scenes and provide more actionable information than has ever been possible. Technologies from this program are intended for transition to the Air Force, Navy and Army. FY 2019 Plans: - Begin the fabrication of a Gen-1 prototype camera integrating the Gen-1 ROIC. - Develop a detailed operational description and simulation for the ReImagine Gen-2 multi-functional digital ROIC, mapping applications and demonstrating enhanced operation and capability. - Initiate design and layout of the ROIC interface and focal plane array layers to operate with the Gen-2 multi-functional digital ROIC for enhanced programmable functionality. - Develop a detailed plan for a Gen-2 multi-functional digital ROIC camera prototype.23.173 27.738 21.000 Volume 1 - 184 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0603739E: ADVANCED ELECTRONICS TECHNOLOGIES UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 5 of 11 R-1 Line #54Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2020 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Date: March 2019 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / 3R-1 ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIESProject (Number/Name) MT-15 / MIXED TECHNOLOGY INTEGRATION B.

Title: Rapid Array Development (RAD) Description: The Rapid Array Development (RAD) program seeks to build an immersive electromagnetic environment for use by the warfighter to understand the effects of electronic maneuvers and to develop new electronic maneuver warfare (EMW) techniques. In order to accomplish this, the program will leverage recent developments in flexible and adaptive radio frequency (RF) hardware, access to a larger variety of more powerful computing platforms, and advances in software virtualization to radically change the development and deployment cycle for EMW techniques. Currently, the development cycle for EMW algorithms is long and costly. However, they must be able to evolve rapidly in order to adapt to new modes of operation and changing operating parameters associated with modern military threats. The programmed RAD testbeds will ultimately train warfighters on how to deal with legacy and emerging threats in the RF spectrum through maneuvers, signal jamming tactics, signal intelligence gathering, and other missions. The outcome of RAD will be better tactics, techniques, and procedures for handling EMW as well as the identification of new technology assets for deploying EMW capabilities. Technologies developed under the RAD program are planned for transition to the Services through a series of demonstrations proving a radically shorter time scale of development. FY 2019 Plans: - Initiate development of a compute engine to optimize the implementation of electromagnetic (EM) algorithms on a system of heterogeneous processors. - Explore use of toolchains and toolsets for programming on heterogeneous computing systems. - Explore new models of machine learning and supervisory controls to manage complex allocation of processing resources. - Initiate development of flexible array technology to be the common hardware platform for an immersive applications development environment.

FY 2019 to FY 2020 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2020 increase reflects the shift from exploring and initiating development to developing RAD software and the testbed environment. Title: Advanced PNT Capability Demonstrations (APCD) Description: Both the Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) and the atomic physics communities have done foundational research on new capabilities that will impact the ability to keep and transfer precision timing and navigation information across the battlefield. The Advanced PNT Capability Demonstrations (APCD) program will choose among the most promising of the new physics developments and demo their potential in realistic warfighting scenarios. One scenario will leverage advances in inertial sensors to enable Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)-only operation over mission timeframes of twenty minutes. The MEMS-based demo will enable munitions navigation in a GPS-denied world, maintaining U.S. munition and missile capability to accurately navigate in future battlespace environments. Another scenario is the storing of time and position information with high performance yet compact, low power atomic physics. This will enable advanced Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) capabilities for example in a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) constellation, or an Unmanned Air Vehicle (UAV) from which the atomic based information can be distributed. Technologies developed under the APCD program are planned for transition to the Services. FY 2020 Plans: - Determine the most sophisticated demonstration highlighting the recent advances in MEMS and atomic physics. - Initiate design of the demonstrator and the subcomponents needed to perform the demonstration. - Develop IMU packaging and support circuitry with emphasis on program metrics including size, weight, stability, and power consumption. FY 2019 to FY 2020 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY Laser-Integrated Diodes (EUCLID) program aims to significantly reduce the size of laser diode pump modules (DPMs) while increasing their electrical-to-optical efficiency. DPMs are a critical component of fiber-laser array weapons systems, which combine light from many lower-power lasers to engage targets at tactically-relevant distances.5.000 5.000 - Volume 1 - 186 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0603739E: ADVANCED ELECTRONICS TECHNOLOGIES UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 7 of 11 R-1 Line #54Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2020 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Date: March 2019 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / 3R-1 ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIESProject (Number/Name) MT-15 / MIXED TECHNOLOGY INTEGRATION B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2018 FY 2019 FY 2020 Commercial DPMs, which cater to the laser manufacturing industry, feature large cooling systems and are too cumbersome for integration into many small DoD platforms. EUCLID plans to leverage advances in thermal management components to design, build, test, and demonstrate densely packageable, prototype DPMs that are less than half the size of their commercial counterparts. The program will also pursue improved optical components that can more efficiently focus light from individual laser diodes. The resulting EUCLID DPMs are intended to be available for procurement and integration into ultra-low size, weight, and power fiber-laser array weapons systems, enabling integration into a variety of Air Force, Navy, Army, and Missile Defense Agency platforms. FY 2019 Plans: - Build and test prototype DPMs which produce >4 kW of optical power and >58% efficiency and are suitable for powering a coherently combinable fiber laser amplifier assembly. - Generate detailed designs of a compact, packaged 4 kW diode pump assembly based on the prototype DPMs. FY 2019 to FY 2020 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY (MIDAS) Description: The Millimeter (MIDAS) program will develop a common millimeter wave phased-array tile that is scalable to large arrays to provide wideband frequency agility from 18-50 GHz with element-level digital beamforming. Millimeter wave systems are used today to achieve physical security through the use of narrow antenna beams in a small form- factor. We see this applied to satellite communications and tactical line-of-sight communications such as in the F-22 and F-35. One of the challenges of using directional communications in mobile applications is the problem of knowing where to point the antenna when both platforms are mobile. This can be solved with digital beamforming to enable a mobile platform to listen in all directions with many antenna beams to facilitate neighbor discovery when transmitting. Digital beamforming also enables multiple beams to communicate with several neighbors simultaneously. This capability will increase the network throughput and robustness that will be tolerant to unexpected outages. To achieve these goals, the program will develop a common digital phased array tile that can be used to build large arrays from this common block. The program will be executed in two primary technical areas. First, advanced complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) will be used to develop the core transceiver elements at a size and power consumption that is required to fit in the small size required by current millimeter wave systems. Second, a combination of advanced packaging and high-performance semiconductors will be used to build the wideband antenna and front-end amplifiers necessary to make a complete system.

Additionally, funding under this project will include establishing access to commercial state-of-the-art (SOTA) and state-of-the-practice (SOTP) foundries for DoD microelectronics fabrication runs, developing a manufacturable photonics and wide bandgap process, creating a microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) multi-project wafer flow, and establishing an application center to capture DoD microelectronics requirements. B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2018 FY 2019 FY 2020 Title: Beyond Scaling - Access Description: The Beyond Scaling - Access program will demonstrate the design and fabrication of advanced electronics through collaborations with leading industry players. Although the United States has led the development of advanced electronics since its inception and is home to three of the five leading-edge foundries, recent investments by foreign competitors are threatening this leadership. Additionally, the fabrication cost of next generation microelectronics has increased at an alarming rate. While the commercial sector is able to spread these costs over a large volume of products, the low volumes used by the DoD has led to a cost barrier in meeting its future technology needs. In some cases, the inability to place orders in volume has created a lack of access to advanced technology nodes entirely. To address this, the DoD must participate in more industry partnerships that not only leverage investments in the commercial industry but also provide access to SOTA facilities in the U.S. This program will build on existing relationships and forge forward-looking collaborations among the commercial electronics community, defense industrial base, university researchers, and the DoD. Activities include establishing access to commercial SOTA and SOTP foundries for DoD microelectronics fabrication runs, developing a manufacturable photonics and wide bandgap process, creating a microelectromechanical systems multi-project wafer flow, and establishing an application center to capture DoD microelectronics requirements. Technologies from this program are intended for transition to the Services. FY 2019 Plans: - Establish SOTA and SOTP microelectronics fabrication runs for DoD designs at leading-edge commercial foundries. - Identify mixed-mode integrated circuit technologies for agile ultra-wide band systems. - Initiate development of advanced process flows for multi-project wafer (MPW) runs at commercial MEMS manufacturers. - Initiate implementation of a framework to capture applications requirements from DoD users.

Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2018 FY 2019 FY 2020 Title: Secure Handhelds on Assured Resilient networks at the tactical Edge (SHARE) Description: The goal of the Secure Handhelds on Assured Resilient networks at the tactical Edge (SHARE) program is to develop innovative networking and information sharing approaches that enable U.S. and coalition forces to coordinate tactical operations effectively, efficiently, and securely by eliminating today's prohibitive security cost and complexity barriers. SHARE will provide the level of security provided by today's communications systems, while managing trust at the tactical edge. Building upon the Spectrum Efficiency and Access program, which is budgeted in this PE/Project, and research into the use of commercial systems and infrastructure to support military operations, SHARE provides new opportunities for U.S. and coalition forces to gain and maintain a tactical advantage on the battlefield. Coordination includes providing all the information required to enable the command and control necessary to plan and execute operations in all phases of warfare. Technology from this program will transition to the Services and DoD Agencies that work with coalition partners. FY 2019 Plans: - Integrate and test multi-level, handheld software and new networking architecture supporting the sharing of information at multiple security levels. - Evaluate user interfaces with operational transition partners. - Conduct controlled, limited field experimentation on handheld devices, demonstrating multi-level secure information sharing and network security. - Develop and update automated network configuration software, ensuring compatibility with handheld and network approach.13.042 28.996 22.942 Volume 1 - 195 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0603760E: COMMAND, CONTROL AND COMMUNICATIONS SYST...

FY 2020 Plans: - Conduct research and experimentation using SHARE software prototype that further supports creation of automated network configuration software. Experiments will test compatibility with existing operationally deployed handheld devices. - Conduct field experimentation during multiple DoD-sponsored coalition exercises to validate SHARE system security and performance. - Begin transition of SHARE software to DoD partners, e.g. the joint Tactical Assault Kit (TAK) development team, for follow-on software configuration management and accreditation for use on approved DoD handheld systems. FY 2019 to FY 2020 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2020 decrease reflects a shift from research to integration of SHARE technologies into existing handheld programs. Title: Dynamic Network Adaptation for Mission Optimization (DyNAMO) Description: Wireless networks have evolved into complex systems having many configurable parameters and features, including link data rates, power settings, inter-network gateways, and security associations. The optimal settings for these features vary greatly depending on the mission for which the network is deployed and the environment in which it is operating. Currently, the majority of these features are optimized off-line for specific scenarios and assumptions and are pre-set before use in a mission. There is no capability for the settings to adapt if the actual mission or environment differs from the original assumptions used to configure the network. The problem is exacerbated in scenarios in which intelligent adversaries can affect the topology and operation of the network unpredictably and on short timescales. Furthermore, future operations will include multiple, different radios interconnected on the same platform, and those existing networks lack a common standard for interoperability. The DyNAMO program will develop software that addresses the incompatibilities preventing information sharing across independent airborne networks and develop new approaches to configure and control networks and networks of networks for operation in dynamic and contested environments. The program will address optimization within legacy and future military networks, interactions between networks, and availability of necessary network services to support mission success. Technologies developed under this program will transition to the Services. FY 2019 Plans: - Continue development and integration of initial instantiation of real-time optimization algorithms in radio hardware. - Conduct hardware-in-the-loop testing of integrated system with instantiations of inter-network coordination, mission-based control, and real-time optimization. - Integrate final instantiation of inter-network coordination, mission-based control, and real-time optimization algorithms in radio hardware. - Conduct ground test of integrated system.14.643 20.965 18.985 Volume 1 - 196 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0603760E: COMMAND, CONTROL AND COMMUNICATIONS SYST...

Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2018 FY 2019 FY 2020 - Conduct field test of integrated system with instantiations of inter-network coordination, mission-based control, and real-time optimization to show the quantitative and qualitative value of DyNAMO for a variety of military missions. FY 2020 Plans: - Integrate program software into tactical radio hardware. - Demonstrate Army, Navy, and Air Force scenarios. - Demonstrate information hyperlayer over diverse networks with publish/subscribe services. - Complete final program demonstrations and transition activities that demonstrate both interoperability and ability to adapt to real- time degradations and changing user needs. FY 2019 to FY 2020 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2020 decrease reflects final demonstrations and completion of proof of concepts. Title: Geospatial Cloud Analytics (GCA) Description: The Geospatial Cloud Analytics (GCA) program will develop technology to access and analyze global-scale, multimodal geospatial data and pilot an analytics-as-a-service business model. Exploiting multiple sources and modalities at a global scale requires the development of technologies and systems that provide common access points to commercial data, computational power to preprocess data and make it exploitable by analytical tools, and new models supporting sensing and analytics as services, including sharing of tools and results between individuals and consortiums. GCA creates a capability for near real time monitoring of global events and change detection across various environments and warfighting domains, building upon the Secure Handhelds on Assured Resilient networks at the tactical Edge (SHARE) coalition warfighter information sharing program, also budgeted in this PE/Project. By exploiting the vast amounts of geospatial information from new commercial satellite constellations and other sources, GCA will create the technology foundations needed to provide global awareness of gray zone activities. It will do so by augmenting commercial capabilities with defense assets, not vice versa, and thereby will improve speed, agility, and scalability. Technology from this program will transition to the Services and DoD Agencies. FY 2019 Plans: - Analyze computational architectures and frameworks for GCA analytics services at global scale. - Demonstrate the ability of the software infrastructure to support global-scale analytics on relevant problem sets. - Demonstrate gray zone indicators and warnings for high-impact, destabilizing global events such as droughts, crop failures, and illegal fishing. - Experiment with approaches for offering analytics services for use by DoD users and others. FY 2020 Plans: - Create and test an analytics marketplace that combines the multi-source, multi-modality platform with global-scale analytics. - Demonstrate ability for DoD users to use the analytics services provided by the analytics marketplace.7.032 21.965 19.993 Volume 1 - 197 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0603760E: COMMAND, CONTROL AND COMMUNICATIONS SYST...

Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2018 FY 2019 FY 2020 - Refine the analytics services and marketplace based on feedback from end users. - Begin development of additional future marketplace offers based on feedback from end users. FY 2019 to FY 2020 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2020 decrease reflects a shift from platform and software development into testing of the analytics marketplace. Title: Network Universal Persistence (Network UP) Description: Current radios send network control information and data using the same wireless link. This produces a common failure mode when that wireless link degrades. In many of today's military wireless networks, even brief wireless link outages create a loss of network connectivity that can take more than two minutes to recover once the wireless link is re-established. During these network outages, data transmission is not possible. Building on technologies explored in the Secure Handhelds on Assured Resilient networks at the tactical Edge (SHARE) program, also in this PE/Project, the Network UP program will develop and demonstrate radio technology that maintains network reliability through periods of frequent signal degradation that routinely occur in military operational environments. Isolation of critical control channel information in a separate, robust wireless link will allow creation of a protected control channel that can maintain network reliability even when the data channel is lost. The Network UP program will develop technology and a prototype system that enables military wireless networks to send data over dynamic, unstable wireless links. The program will develop approaches to separate the control and data planes across different wireless links and design and implement mechanisms to maintain synchronization across those separate links. Technologies developed under this program will transition to the Services. FY 2019 Plans: - Begin preliminary design of a radio architecture and supporting technology that implement separate control and data channels. - Begin preliminary design of network architectures and technologies that enable creation of a network with physically separated control and data links. - Begin early lab testing of radio and network architectures and technology approaches. FY 2020 Plans: - Demonstrate a communication system that provides reliable communications in the presence of jamming. - Demonstrate physical communications channel divided into two separate functions and radio frequency bands. - Complete design of radio architectures and build and test prototypes. - Complete design of network architectures and build and test prototypes. - Demonstrate radio architectures in highly mobile scenarios with large amounts of environmental attenuation.

Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2018 FY 2019 FY 2020 The FY 2020 increase reflects increased effort dedicated to prototype building and testing. Title: Protected Forward Communications (PFC) Description: The collaborative application of combat power in ground tactical operations demands reliable exchange of rich information and precise coordination of actions across various echelons. These operations take place over three critical conversations: (1) to coordinate the actions of a local group, (2) to coordinate group and airborne assets, and (3) to interact with rear echelon command. The communication links over which these three conversations take place are at risk from jamming and geolocation operations conducted with increasingly sophisticated exploitation and denial technology employed by our adversaries. This problem is compounded by demands for ever-increasing capacity of these links. The Protected Forward Communications (PFC) program will build on technical advances in resilient, efficient, and aware communications technology to design a single communication architecture to protect all three conversations from jamming and geolocation. PFC builds on technology developed in the Secure Handhelds on Assured Resilient networks at the tactical Edge (SHARE) program, also budgeted in this PE/Project. PFC is generally applicable to small unit operations and is particularly relevant to the close air support (CAS) function typically executed by the Joint Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC) or Forward Air Controller (FAC). The PFC program will transition to the Services. FY 2019 Plans: - Commence algorithm design for implementation and control of all three communication techniques. - Begin concept validation through modeling and simulation. - Establish readiness of constituent link technologies for all three communication techniques. FY 2020 Plans: - Conduct simulation and modeling of systems in representative operating environments to assess resistance to geolocation and jamming. - Conduct system engineering reviews to ensure design readiness for further development. - Conduct experimental validation of key design elements. - Develop size, weight, and power estimates for complete prototype and complete system. - Produce fully qualified design of PFC communication system with data artifacts. FY 2019 to FY 2020 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2020 increase reflects a shift from modeling and simulation to experimental and demonstration validation.- 12.593 19.580 Title: Information Based Multi-level Information Based Multi-level secure Mosaics (IBM2) will develop network and data management tools for automating establishment of cross-domain networks and managing information flow to support on-the-fly adaptive effects webs.- - 10.365 Volume 1 - 199 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0603760E: COMMAND, CONTROL AND COMMUNICATIONS SYST...

Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2018 FY 2019 FY 2020 Today the operational configure time required to make systems share information in battle, even when using networks designed to interoperate, is on the magnitude of weeks to months, but effective joint multi-domain battle integration time is needed in minutes or faster. Technology advances are making it possible to pass messages across heterogeneous waveforms and networks, but there are no technologies today that can determine if it is the right data most important to end users and systems. Building upon technologies developed in the Dynamic Network Adaption for Mission Optimization (DyNAMO) program (budgeted in this PE/ Project), IBM2 will combine network management with information exploitation and fusion technology to route information in an understandable context, based upon information need and value. IBM2 also seeks to address multi-level security configuration issues that often add delays and limit interoperability. Technology developed by this program will transition to the Services. FY 2020 Plans: - Assess effectiveness of machine learning, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for understanding context and information value at user, system, and mission nodes. - Begin development of algorithmic techniques for determining global information relevance and importance and converting it to local context. - Begin development of algorithms for auto-generating security labels for multi-level security gateways as appropriate for protecting sources. FY 2019 to FY 2020 Increase/Decrease Statement: Increase in FY 2020 reflects Logistics and Information (LogX) Description: The Composable Logistics and Information Omniscience (LogX) program will develop planning and execution software to enable resilient and survivable logistics. The software will integrate enhanced situational awareness, dynamic composition of sustainment options, and accelerated Course of Action (COA) development. Based upon technologies developed in the Prototype Resilient Operations Testbed for Expeditionary Urban Systems of Systems (PROTEUS) program (budgeted in PE 0603766E, Project NET-01), the LogX capability will allow users to achieve a more distributed and resilient logistics command and control (C2) system utilizing planned cloud-based data environments. The new capability will be tested in an experimental environment tied to current logistics datasets. Technologies from this program will be transitioned to the Services, combatant commands, including U.S. Transportation Command.

FY 2019 to FY 2020 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2020 increase reflects program initiation. Title: Decomp/Recomp Description: A future Joint Multi-Domain Battle force must be able to interoperate amongst heterogeneous systems rapidly, as well as use those systems in new ways. The battle network must be able to access latent capability provided by existing systems to build and close a wide range of effects chains. Resources in the battlespace will need to be repurposed with minor modification in ways for which they may not have been initially designed to create new capability without resorting to traditional acquisition. The Decomp/Recomp program will develop technology to enable efficient software modification to enable the integration or adaptation of electronic military systems to create new capability rapidly. Using techniques developing in the commercial software community and building on insights developed in the System of Systems Integration Technology Experimentation (SoSITE) program (budgeted in PE0603766E/Project NET-01); technology developed under the Decomp/Recomp program will decompose existing programmable military electronic system software into building blocks that can be rapidly reassembled into new, interoperable functions. The program will ensure performance reliability meets mission expectations with minimal to no formal validation and verification. The program aims to provide this degree of integration and adaptation on mission-relevant timelines, hours to days instead of months to years. Technologies developed under this program will transition to the Services. FY 2020 Plans: - Begin to demonstrate, through modeling and simulation, ability to identify mission capability from component systems. - Begin development of automated processes to validate and verify that adapted applications perform as intended when installed during demonstrations. FY 2019 to FY 2020 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY Title: 100 Gb/s RF Backbone Description: The proliferation of video, voice, chat, and other important data-streams on the battlefield is driving a need for higher capacity, reliable, assured, and all-weather communications that are deployable on a wide range of air, ground, and maritime platforms. The goal of this High-Capacity Links technologies program is to demonstrate a 100 Gigabit-per-second (Gb/s) radio frequency (RF) backbone that will meet the anticipated mid-term (within 3-10 years) wireless networking capacity needs of deployed military forces. A millimeter-wave (mmW) solution will provide high capacity and all-weather resiliency but presents technical challenges that include the generation of higher-order waveforms (beyond common data link), efficient power transmission, high-speed routing, and low-noise receivers. This program seeks to develop the constituent subsystems (waveform3.233 2.433 - Volume 1 - 201 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0603760E: COMMAND, CONTROL AND COMMUNICATIONS SYST...

Technology developed under this program will transition to the Services and other government agencies. FY 2019 Plans: - Integrate prototype onto test aircraft and conduct air-to-ground testing. - Complete air-to-ground testing and conduct flight demonstrations. FY 2019 to FY 2020 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2020 decrease reflects program completion. Title: Spectrum Efficiency and Access Description: The Federal Government is working to transition large swaths of spectrum (up to 500 MHz) from Federal (DoD is the primary contributor) to civilian use for broadband telecommunications. The DoD will need more highly integrated and networked sensor and data capacity over the next decades and will therefore need new technology that requires less spectrum to operate. The objective of the Spectrum Efficiency and Access program is to investigate improvements in spectral reuse, such as spectrum sharing of sensor and radar bands with communication systems. The program will leverage technologies originally developed for radar anti-jam and interference mitigation that could enable spectrum sharing by allowing overlay of communications within the same spectral footprint. The approach will include exploring real-time control data links between radars and communications systems and developing the advanced waveforms and components to enable radars and communication networks to operate in close proximity. The ultimate goal is to turn the DoD spectrum loss into a net gain of up to hundreds of MHz in capacity. Technology from this program will transition to the Navy, Army, and Missile Defense Agency (MDA). FY 2019 Plans: - Demonstrate spectrum maneuver command and control concepts. - Finalize design of a system capable of dynamically controlling radio frequency signatures while maintaining high accuracy target tracking.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Network-Centric Warfare Technology Program Element is budgeted in the Advanced Technology Development budget activity because it addresses high payoff opportunities to develop and rapidly mature advanced technologies and systems required for today's network-centric warfare concepts. It is imperative for the future of the U.S. forces to operate flawlessly with each other, regardless of which services and systems are involved in any particular mission. The overarching goal of this program element is to enable technologies at all levels, regardless of service component, to operate as one system. The objective of the Joint Warfare Systems project is to create enabling technologies for seamless joint operations, from strategic planning to tactical and urban operations. Joint Warfare Systems leverage current and emerging network, robotic, and information technology and provide next generation U.S. forces with greatly expanded capability, lethality, and rapid responsiveness. Critical issues facing this project are: (1) U.S. opponents utilizing systems that are flexible, robust, and difficult to neutralize; and (2) U.S. doctrine that limits the use of firepower to lessen the impact of operations on noncombatants. These problems are magnified in urban and semi-urban areas where combatants and civilians are often collocated, and in peacekeeping operations where combatants and civilians are often indistinguishable. Meeting these challenges places a heavy burden on joint war planning. Understanding opponent networks is essential so that creative options can be developed to counter their strategies. Synchronization of air and ground operations to apply force only where needed and with specific effects is required. The Maritime Systems project is identifying, developing and rapidly maturing critical advanced technologies and system concepts for the naval forces' role in today's network centric warfare concept. Improvements in communications between and among submarines, surface ships and naval aircraft have allowed these forces to operate seamlessly with each other and with other Service's network centric systems. Naval forces will play an ever-increasing role in network centric warfare because of their forward deployed nature, their unique capability to operate simultaneously in the air, on the sea and under the sea and their versatile ability to provide both rapid strike and project-sustained force. The technologies developed under this project will capitalize on these attributes, improve them and enable them to operate with other network centric forces.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The objective of the Joint Warfare Systems project is to create enabling technologies for seamless joint operations, from strategic planning to tactical and urban operations. Joint Warfare Systems leverage current and emerging network, robotic, and information technology and provide next generation U.S. forces with greatly increased capability, lethality, and rapid responsiveness. Critical issues facing this project are: (1) U.S. opponents using systems that are flexible, robust, and difficult to neutralize; and (2) U.S. doctrine that limits the use of firepower to lessen the impact of operations on noncombatants. These problems are magnified in urban and semi-urban areas where combatants and civilians are often co-located and in peacekeeping operations where combatants and civilians are often indistinguishable. Meeting these challenges places a heavy burden on joint war planning. Understanding opponent networks is essential so that creative options can be developed to counter their strategies. Synchronization of air and ground operations to apply force only where needed and with specific effects is required. This project supports all levels of the force structure including: (1) the strategic/operational level by generating targeting options against opponents' centers of gravity that have complex networked relationships; (2) the tactical/operational level by managing highly automated forces with tight coupling between air and ground platforms; and (3) the focused tactical level by developing platforms and tools, which acquire targets of opportunity and cue network-based analysis of likely enemy operations thus maximizing the effectiveness of ground forces in stability and support operations.

Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2018 FY 2019 FY 2020 Title: System of Systems Integration Technology and Experimentation (SoSITE) Description: The System of Systems Integration Technology and Experimentation (SoSITE) program seeks to implement an architecture framework capable of assessing and demonstrating potential operational benefits of integrating various system capabilities to improve mission success in contested environments. Such assessments would optimize system-level trades of requirements and architectures to leverage an integrated set of system characteristics and capabilities. The demonstration assessment metrics will measure individual and combined system performance to streamline resource allocation to maximize operational impact. In addition, providing a modeling and simulation (M&S) environment to assess complex systems will enable greater utility of emerging system technologies, since they can be assessed in near-real-world simulations without the real-world costs of testing fully integrated systems. The program will also develop system synthesis and integration technologies that enable rapid assimilation of new and off-the-shelf technologies into the system of systems architecture. These technologies will break down current barriers to entry that new technologies face in system of systems using formal methods, compositional reasoning, and automated design space exploration. Technologies from this program will be transitioned to the Services.

Title: Resilient Synchronized Planning and Assessment for the Contested Environment (RSPACE) Description: Currently, Command and Control (C2) of air platforms is a highly centralized process operating largely independently across planning domains (Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR), strike, and spectrum management) and is optimized for a permissive environment. To address the challenges faced in today's increasingly contested environments, the Resilient Synchronized Planning and Assessment for the Contested Environment (RSPACE) program will develop tools and models to enable distribution of planning functions across the C2 hierarchy for resilience (e.g., loss of communications), while synchronizing strike, ISR, and spectrum planning to maximize the contribution of all assets through increased utilization and exploitation of synergies. The program will develop tools supporting a mixed initiative planning approach, maximizing automation according to operator's choice, and enabling human-in-the-loop intervention and modification. RSPACE will also develop tactical decision aids for maritime commanders and planners to build and assess courses of action (COAs) for fleet and ship movements and the employment of counter-ISR techniques. During execution, the tools will provide lifecycle tracking of targeting and information needs and support assessment of progress towards achieving the commander's intent.

Current infrastructure and technology do not support experimentation with distributed heterogeneous systems. Based upon technologies developed in the System of Systems Integration Technology and Experimentation (SoSITE) program, budgeted in this PE/Project, the Air Combat Evolution (ACE) program will apply technologies and principles of interoperability, autonomy, and artificial intelligence (AI) to develop an experimentation infrastructure that will allow for the integration of various modeling and simulation (M&S), sub-scale, and ultimately full-scale vehicles in dynamic aerial combat environment. The program will deliver an initial instantiation of a scalable experimentation engine capable of aircraft control at levels ranging from an advanced tactical autopilot to a form of multi-domain mosaic controller. Experiments will explore both augmentation of existing manned platforms and increased capabilities and intelligence of future unmanned systems. ACE will provide an early opportunity to experiment with adaptive human-machine teaming to deliver tools and architectures as the Joint Multi-Domain Battle concept evolves within the Services. Higher-fidelity simulated adversary human behavior will also be developed to ensure blue operators conducting experiments are faced with more realistic dilemmas posed by computer-played adversaries.

Title: Retrodirective Arrays for Coherent Transmission (ReACT) Description: Worldwide advancements in signal processing and electronics have decreased the effectiveness of single-platform, power-based Electronic Warfare (EW) as a viable technique in the future. The goal of the Retrodirective Arrays for Coherent Transmission (ReACT) program was to develop and demonstrate the capability to combine distributed mobile transmitters to direct high-power spatially resolved radio frequency (RF) beams to a single location. ReACT provides this capability by synchronizing multiple distributed transmitters to form a much larger effective array than a single aperture. The key technical challenge was to synchronize distributed and moving transmitters while compensating for platform motion and vibration. The ReACT system sensed the target's emissions and then optimally configured the ReACT transmitters to focus on the area of interest.

Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2018 FY 2019 FY 2020 Title: Cross Domain Maritime Surveillance and Targeting (CDMaST) Description: The Cross Domain Maritime Surveillance and Targeting (CDMaST) program seeks to identify and implement architectures consisting of novel combinations of manned and unmanned systems to execute long-range kill chains and develop a robust \"kill web\" against submarines and ships over large contested maritime areas. By exploiting promising new developments in unmanned platforms, seafloor systems, and emerging long-range weapon systems, the program will develop an advanced, integrated undersea and above sea warfighting capability. The CDMaST program will establish an analytical and experimental environment to explore architecture combinations in terms of operational effectiveness as well as engineering feasibility and robustness.

Title: Positioning System for Deep Ocean Navigation (POSYDON) Description: The Positioning System for Deep Ocean Navigation (POSYDON) program will provide continuous, Global Positioning System (GPS)-level positioning accuracy to submarines and autonomous undersea vehicles (AUVs) in the ocean over extended periods of time. Undersea navigation cannot use GPS because the water blocks its signals. At shallower depths, masts can be raised to receive GPS signals, but masts present a detection risk. Typically, the alternative to GPS for undersea navigation has been inertial navigation systems (INS), but INS accuracy can degrade unacceptably over time. The POSYDON program will distribute a small number of acoustic sources, analogous to GPS satellites, around an ocean basin at known locations. A submarine or AUV will be equipped with an acoustic receiver and appropriate software in order to obtain and maintain location. By transmitting specific acoustic waveforms and developing accurate acoustic propagation models to predict and interpret the complex arrival structure of the acoustic sources, the submarine or AUV can determine its range from each source and thus calculate its position. Technologies developed under this program will transition to the Navy. FY 2019 Plans: - Design and test a prototype POSYDON system. - Demonstrate real-time positioning for relevant AUV platforms. - Document results of at-sea testing to support systems integration.

Title: Angler Description: The undersea domain has significant importance to national security and military operations. Yet it is a challenging domain in which to operate due to extreme water pressures, restricted communications, ever changing bottom environments, marine fouling and corrosion. The Angler program seeks to improve U.S. operations in this domain by enabling underwater robotic systems significantly ahead of the state of the art. These robotic systems would be able to search and manipulate objects autonomously, even in dark, turbulent, and semi-opaque sea conditions without the need for human control and without reliance on the Global Positioning System (GPS).

This connectivity is important for synchronizing forces, establishing and maintaining situation awareness, and control of remotely operated vehicles and systems. Additionally, undersea systems are challenged to maintain connectivity and must carry their own energy and operate over their design lifetime with little to no maintenance and repair. These factors inhibit their use in collaborative networks13.430 7.733 - Volume 1 - 219 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0603766E: NETWORK-CENTRIC WARFARE TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 16 of 19 R-1 Line #56Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2020 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Date: March 2019 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / NET-02 B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2018 FY 2019 FY 2020 and prevent the full exploitation of the potential of undersea systems. The Tactical Undersea Network Architectures program will overcome these limitations by developing the technologies necessary for autonomous, reliable, and secure undersea data transfers; true plug, play, and operate standards; and rapid, cost-effective deployment technologies.

FY 2019 to FY 2020 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2020 decrease reflects program completion. Title: Tactical Exploitation of the Acoustic Channel (TEAC) Description: The Tactical Exploitation of the Acoustic Channel (TEAC) program will provide the capability to coherently combine acoustic energy from a distributed network of underwater acoustic sources to improve signal transmission in an undersea environment. The ability to cohere multiple underwater sensors will have a transformative impact on a number of compelling applications including surveillance, communications, and vehicle positioning. For all of these applications, sensor gain is currently achieved by deploying large, costly, and cumbersome cabled arrays. The TEAC program will create the opportunity to deploy groups of low unit-cost sources that work cooperatively to focus energy undersea. This provides an extensible, affordable, and flexible method to harness the rapid development of undersea vehicles and new acoustic source technologies. Technologies developed under this program are intended to transition to the Navy. FY 2019 Plans: - Demonstrate and test at-sea cohering of acoustic sources. - Analyze sea-test data to identify system performance robustness. - Begin development of command and control for a semi-autonomous distributed system.12.270 7.699 - Volume 1 - 220 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0603766E: NETWORK-CENTRIC WARFARE TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 17 of 19 R-1 Line #56Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2020 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Date: March 2019 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / NET-02 B.

Title: Hydra Description: The Hydra program developed and demonstrated advanced capabilities for the undersea deployment and employment of unique payloads. Hydra integrated existing and emerging technologies and the ability to be positioned in the littoral undersea battlespace to create a disruptive capability. The system consisted of a modular enclosure with communications, command and control, energy storage, and standard interfaces for payload systems. The modular enclosures were deployed by various means, depending on the need for speed and stealth, and remain deployed until awakened for employment. Hydra developed critical enabling technologies for energy storage and recharging, communications, command and control, deployment, and autonomous operations. Technology developed under this program is transitioned to the Navy.7.558 - - Title: Blue Wolf Description: Undersea platforms have inherent operational and tactical advantages such as stealth and surprise. Platform drag due to fluid viscosity and platform powering requirements varies with the speed through the water. Platform energy and power density limitations create two distinct operational usage profiles: one for unmanned undersea vehicles (low speed, long endurance) and another for undersea weapons (high speed, short endurance). Designers have historically solved this with hybrid systems such as the Navy's Vertical Launch Anti-Submarine Rocket, or by increasing the size of undersea systems. However, hybrid systems can be vulnerable to air and undersea defensive systems and larger undersea systems can result in significant launch platform modifications. The Blue Wolf program provided a radically different solution to develop and demonstrate an undersea demonstrator vehicle with endurance and speed capabilities beyond conventional undersea systems within the weight and volume envelopes of current Navy undersea systems. Significant technical challenges addressed included, dynamic lift and drag reduction, hybrid energy system development compatible with existing manned platform safety requirements and certification, and system integration and demonstration in at-sea environment. The program leveraged Navy connectivity, autonomy, guidance, navigation, and obstacle avoidance technologies. Under an existing Memorandum of Agreement, following vehicle integration and initial testing, the program is transitioning to the Navy.4.500 - - Title: Hybrid Multi Material Rotor Full Scale Demonstration (HyDem) 3.000 - - Volume 1 - 221 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0603766E: NETWORK-CENTRIC WARFARE TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 18 of 19 R-1 Line #56Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2020 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Date: March 2019 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / NET-02 B.

This new propulsor enabled the Navy to operate its submarine fleet with improved capability, allowing for the creation of strategic surprise. Submarines can exploit expanded areas previously unattainable for the purpose of submarine warfare, including antisubmarine warfare (ASW), antisurface warfare (ASuW), intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) gathering, strike, Special Forces operations, and strategic deterrence missions. The Navy has evaluated this component in sea trials. It is envisioned that the Navy will integrate this design change into the future development of the Virginia Class and Columbia Class submarines, and could back-fit previously constructed Virginia Class submarines. Technology developed under this program has transitioned to the Navy. Accomplishments/Planned Programs Subtotals 123.462 110.363 132.484 C.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Sensor Technology program element is budgeted in the Advanced Technology Development Budget Activity because it funds sensor efforts that will improve the accuracy and timeliness of our surveillance and targeting systems for improved battlefield awareness, strike capability and battle damage assessment. The Surveillance and Countermeasures Technology project funds sensor efforts that will improve the accuracy and timeliness of our surveillance and targeting systems for improved battlefield awareness, strike capability, and battle damage assessment. Timely surveillance of enemy territory under all weather conditions is critical to providing our forces with the tactical information needed to succeed in future wars. This operational surveillance capability must continue to perform during enemy efforts to deny and deceive the sensor systems, and operate, at times, in a clandestine manner. This project will exploit recent advances in multispectral target phenomenology, signal processing, low-power high-performance computing, and low-cost microelectronics to develop advanced surveillance and targeting systems. In addition, this project encompasses several advanced technologies related to the development of techniques to counter advanced battlefield threats. The Sensors and Processing Systems project develops and demonstrates the advanced sensor and processing technologies and systems necessary for Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions. Future battlefields will continue to be populated with targets that use mobility and concealment as key survival tactics, and high-value targets will range from specific individual insurgents and vehicles to groups of individuals and large platforms such as mobile missile launchers and artillery. The Sensors and Processing Systems project is primarily driven by four needs: (a) providing day-night ISR capabilities against the entire range of potential targets; (b) countering camouflage, concealment, and deception of mobile ground targets; (c) detecting and identifying objects of interest/targets across wide geographic areas in near-real-time; and (d) enabling reliable identification, precision fire control tracking, timely engagement, and accurate battle damage assessment of ground targets.

Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2018 FY 2019 FY 2020 Title: Aerial Dragnet Description: Aerial Dragnet seeks to detect multiple small Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) in complex and/or urban terrain before they are within Line-Of-Sight (LOS) of friendly assets. Unlike traditional air targets, small UASs pose a special threat in urban terrain for several reasons: they can fly at low altitudes between buildings, they are small making them difficult to sense, and they move at slow speeds making them difficult to differentiate from other moving objects. Moreover, the development of small UASs is driven by commercial technologies, which make them rapidly adaptable and very easy to use. Building upon research conducted in the System of Systems Integration Technology and Experimentation (SoSITE) program (budgeted in PE 0603766E, Project NET-01), Aerial Dragnet will perform surveillance using an architecture consisting of networked sensors mounted on distributed aerial platforms. The ability to see over and into urban terrain allows an Aerial Dragnet to detect, track, and classify UAS incursions rapidly, thus enabling multiple defeat options. This program focuses on the development of payloads to be hosted on unmanned aerial platforms, comprising of signal processing software, sensor hardware, and networking for distributed, autonomous operation. The system will be scalable to provide cost-effective surveillance coverage from neighborhood to city-sized areas. Aerial Dragnet technologies are expected to transition to the Army, Marine Corps, and Department of Homeland Security.

Title: Collection and Monitoring via Planning for Active Situational Scenarios (COMPASS)* Description: *formerly Cognitive Maneuver The Collection and Monitoring via Planning for Active Situational Scenarios (COMPASS) program will build decision aids for gray zone scenarios, where adversaries attempt to manipulate a U.S.-allied nation through the use of both kinetic and non- kinetic means. Based on research performed under the Resilient Synchronized Planning & Assessment Contested Environment (RSPACE) program, budgeted in PE 0603766E, Project NET-01, the purpose of the COMPASS program is to reduce ambiguity and reveal intent of gray zone actors who use techniques such as misinformation and intimidation to destabilize host nations and possibly produce advantageous conditions for military engagements. The tools produced by COMPASS will automate gray zone information operations and help U.S. forces adapt to changing conditions and adversary responses. Instead of relying on passive collection of sensory data, COMPASS will employ active sensing and recommend actions that U.S. Forces and allied partners can take to stimulate the environment and reveal any hostile strategies. To achieve this goal, COMPASS will build and- 10.458 19.153 Volume 1 - 234 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0603767E: SENSOR TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 11 of 15 R-1 Line #57Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2020 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Date: March 2019 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / SENSOR (Number/Name) SEN-02 / SENSORS AND PROCESSING SYSTEMS B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2018 FY 2019 FY 2020 demonstrate tools to 1) develop a dynamic model of hostile activities in a gray zone environment, 2) assess the decision space to recommend which actions may provide the highest value information, and 3) monitor execution of these actions to assess incremental progress toward reducing the ambiguity of the operating environment and suggest adjustments. COMPASS will transition to the Services. FY 2019 Plans: - Develop a taxonomy for COMPASS operations. - Design gray zone modeling, initial algorithms for action generation, and initial development of monitor and assessment tools. - Build a library of real and synthetic data and a laboratory simulation test environment. - Commence development of technology to create a situational awareness picture when critical services of the operating environment are disrupted. FY 2020 Plans: - Increase complexity of the gray zone environment and improve the effectiveness of the algorithms for action generation. - Expand situational awareness to include social activities such as economic, political, and influence campaigns. - Improve the functionality of the tool to account for adversaries that adapt their behavior. - Conduct demonstrations for operational users to assess utility and explore transition. FY 2019 to FY 2020 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2020 increase reflects increased modeling efforts and increased demonstrations with operational users. Title: Cross-Domain Multi-Modality Sensing & Targeting Description: The Cross-Domain Multi-Modality Sensing & Targeting program will develop sensors and exploitation techniques capable of performing wide-area search to detect high-value targets in order to task engagement systems to close effects- chains. Finding and prosecuting targets with distributed effects chains requires the ability to detect, track, and maintain custody of targets across sensors with different modalities residing in various domains. Building upon technologies from the Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) program, budgeted in this PE/Project, this program will examine both the sensors and the exploitation needed to perform this wide area search for missions in denied territories and maintain positive chain of custody hand-offs to one or more targeting sensors. The sensors developed under this program will concentrate on sensor modalities that are mostly geometry-invariant and have the potential to be used in highly proliferated systems, such as small satellite constellations and small terrestrial platforms (e.g. class-I or II unmanned aerial system). The exploitation portion of this program will develop algorithms to ensure consistency when passing chain of custody between sensors in different domains with possibly different sensing modalities and will also be designed to increase confidence and accuracy as targets are passed between sensors. Technology developed by this program will transition to the Services and other government agencies.- - 10.322 Volume 1 - 235 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0603767E: SENSOR TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 12 of 15 R-1 Line #57Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2020 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Date: March 2019 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / SENSOR (Number/Name) SEN-02 / SENSORS AND PROCESSING SYSTEMS B.

FY 2019 to FY 2020 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2020 increase reflects program initiation. Title: Spatial, Temporal and Orientation Information for Contested Environments (STOIC) Description: The Spatial, Temporal and Orientation Information for Contested Environments (STOIC) program will enable precision cooperative effects by developing global time transfer and synchronization systems independent of GPS. As a corollary to time synchronization, this program will also enable GPS-independent positioning to maintain precise time synchronization between collaborating mobile users. Key attributes of this program are global availability, minimal and low cost infrastructure, anti- jamming capability, and performance equal to or better than GPS, achieved through recent advances in optical clocks and time transfer. Demonstrations on relevant platforms in relevant environments will be used to validate the technology. This program will transition to the Services, emphasizing platforms that operate in GPS-denied environments. FY 2019 Plans: - Conduct field demonstrations of Very Low Frequency (VLF)-based positioning system with ionospheric modeling correction to validate performance in a relevant environment. - Conduct evaluation and analysis of field test results. - Transition VLF-based positioning system to Army and Navy acquisition programs. FY 2019 to FY 2020 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2020 decrease reflects program 3.189 - Title: Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) Technology Description: Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) systems provide the capability to detect, identify, and track high value targets from collected sensor data. Current ATRs are typically designed for specific sensors and provide only limited, static mission support due to pre-programmed target lists and operating modes. Extending ATR technology to accommodate sensor upgrades or include new emerging targets can be costly and time-consuming. The objective of the ATR Technology program is to develop technologies that reduce operational limitations while also providing significant performance improvements, dramatically reduced development times, and reduced life-cycle maintenance costs. Recent breakthroughs in deep learning algorithms and embedded computing systems offer promise for dramatic improvements in ATR utility. The program will focus on three core areas: (1) development of on-line adaptive algorithms that enable performance-driven sensing and ATR utility; (2) algorithm 1 - 236 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0603767E: SENSOR TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 13 of 15 R-1 Line #57Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2020 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Date: March 2019 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / SENSOR (Number/Name) SEN-02 / SENSORS AND PROCESSING SYSTEMS B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2018 FY 2019 FY 2020 technology that enables rapid incorporation of new targets; and (3) technologies that dramatically reduce required data rates, processing times, and the overall hardware and software demands of ATR systems. ATR technology developed under the program is planned for transition to the Services. FY 2019 Plans: - Continue ATR algorithm development with the focus on significantly reducing training data requirements. - Conduct additional flight demonstrations of ATR algorithms operating on an airborne platform to facilitate transition to the Services. - Extend ATR applications to the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency (NGA) Scale cloud computing environment and other Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance (ISR) systems. FY 2019 to FY 2020 Increase/Decrease Statement: The 2020 Title: Video-rate Synthetic Aperture Radar (ViSAR) Description: Recent conflicts have demonstrated the need for close air support by precision attack platforms, such as the AC-130J aircraft, in support of ground forces. Under clear conditions, targets are easily identified and engaged quite effectively, but in degraded environments, the atmosphere can inhibit traditional optical sensors. The AC-130J must fly above cloud decks in order to avoid anti-aircraft fire, negating optical targeting sensors. Similarly, rotary/wing blades in urban operations generate copious amounts of dust that prevent circling assets from supplying cover fire for ground forces. The Video-rate Synthetic Aperture Radar (ViSAR) program developed a real-time spotlight Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging sensor that provides imagery of a region to allow high-resolution fire direction in conditions where optical sensors do not function. Technology from this program transitioned to the Special Operations Command (SOCOM).2.300 - - Title: Adaptive Radar Countermeasures (ARC) Description: The Adaptive Radar Countermeasures (ARC) program developed new algorithms for rapidly protecting DoD systems against new or unknown radar-based threats. Protecting these systems currently relies on uniquely identifying an enemy radar and applying an appropriate, pre-programmed Electronic Countermeasure (ECM), which can take years to develop. The emergence of digitally-programmed radars that exhibit novel behaviors and agile waveform characteristics, however, has made this approach to countering radar-based threats increasingly challenging. Developing new ECM over several years is no longer sufficient. ARC developed new processing techniques and algorithms that adapt in real-time to generate suitable countermeasures. The program transitioned to Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps airborne electronic warfare systems.3.200 - - Accomplishments/Planned Programs Subtotals 85.347 63.562 69.452 Volume 1 - 237 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0603767E: SENSOR TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 14 of 15 R-1 Line #57Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2020 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Date: March 2019 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / SENSOR TECHNOLOGYProject (Number/Name) SEN-02 / SENSORS AND PROCESSING SYSTEMS C.
