Clinical Trials.gov registration information includes 13 modules for describing the study protocol , including Study Identification, Study Status, Oversight, Study Design, Outcome Measures, Eligibility, and others. After a record is released by the responsible party in the Protocol Registration and Results System (also called the PRS), the record is revi ewed by National Library of Medicine (NLM) reviewers before it is posted on ClinicalTrials.gov. As part of the QC review process, the reviewer provides the responsible party with comments noting Major Issues and Advisory Issues. Each Major Issue must be c orrected or addressed; Advisory Issues are suggestions for improving the clarity of the record. The QC review process ends when all Major Issues noted in PRS Review Comments have been corrected or addressed by the responsible party. However, NLM may notify responsible parties of issues with a record and request revisions after registration information has been posted publicly. The responsible party is responsible for ensuring that the study follows all applicable laws and regulations and that the study rec ord is consistent with these criteria . The posting of registration information following the QC review process does not necessarily mean that the information complies with Section 801 of the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act (FDAAA 801) and the F inal Rule for Clinical Trials Registration and Results Information Submission (42 CFR Part 11). The QC review process is intended to help identify apparent errors, deficiencies, and/or inconsistencies in the submitted information; however, it does not asse ss the appropriateness of the scientific design and analytic approach and cannot ensure that the information is \"truthful and non -misleading\" under the relevant regulatory standards. Additional information about FDAAA 801 and the Final Rule is available at https://prsinfo.clinicaltrials.gov . ClinicalTrials. gov Protocol Registration and Document Upload Quality Control Review Criteria 27 June 2018 Page 2 of 10 General Preferred Formatting Overview These instructions are intended as a style guide, and registration information should be provided in the format described belo w. However, the QC review focuses on substantive issues, so the review comments may not note every formatting issue within the registration information. General Preferred Formatting Review Criteria 1. The study record is written in the third person. 2. The r ecord does not have duplicate or redundant information provided for multiple data elements. 3. Free -text fields are blank if there is no information to report, and they do not contain text such as \"TBD ,\" \"Pending ,\" \"N/A ,\" \"None ,\" or similar . 4. Acronyms and abbr eviations are spelled out, with the acronym or abbreviation provided in parentheses immediately after, at least the first time they are used (e.g., myocardial infarction (MI), major adverse cardiac events (MACE)). 5.

Numerical values use a period for the decimal point and either a comma for the thousands separator or no separator (e.g., 1,234,567.89 or 1234567.89). 7. Symbols are spelled out (e.g., \"percentage\" for the % symbol, \"number\" for the # symbol). 8. A caret, ( ^) is used to indicate exponents (e.g., kg/m^2). 9. \"Participants\" is the preferred term, rather than \"subjects\" or \"patients.\" 10. Interventions are referred to by the same name throughout the study record. 11. If more than one name is used for the same drug (e.g., a generic name and a brand name), the study record clearly indicates that the drugs are the same. 12. Intervention names are the nonproprietary (i.e., generic) names instead of internal company serial numbers, if possible. 13. Outcome Measure Titles do not end wit h a period. General Review Criteria 1. The r ecord must be in English, with the possible exception of the Official Title ; Name of the Sponsor ; Collaborator s; and Human Subjects Review Board Name, Board Affiliation, and Board Contact data elements. 2.

The Intervention Name (s) are specific, unless the study record clearly indicates that the study is not evaluating a specific intervention or exposure. 8. The Intervention Description include s sufficient details to distinguish the intervention being described from other , similar interventions. Outcome Measures Module Review Criteria 1. Overall Record Consistency : The Outcome Measure Title, Description, and Time Frame are consistent with each other and with information provided in other parts of the study record. The following apply to the Outcome Measure Title and Description: 2. The Outcome Measure Title describes the specific measurement that will be used (e.g., a descriptive name of the scale, physiological parameter, or questionnaire) and the metric for how the collected measurement data will be aggregated (e.g., mean change from baseline). Examples of appropriate Outcome Measure Titles : \"Number of Participants with Treatment - Related Adverse Events as Assessed by CTCAE v4.0 ,\" \"Mean Change from Baseline in Pain Scores on the Visual Analog Scale at 6 Weeks ,\" \"Area under the Plasma Concentration versus Time Curve (AUC) of [ drug name ]\" Examples of inappropriate Outcome Measure Titles : \"Safety ,\" \"Tolerability ,\" \"Efficacy ,\" Life,\" \"Satisfaction \" ClinicalTrials. gov Protocol Registration and Document Upload Quality Control Review Criteria 27 June 2018 Page 7 of 10 3. The Outcome Measure Title is \"outcome neutral ,\" when possible, especially when reporting a change in a continuous variable (e.g., \"Change in Systolic Blood Pressure ,\" not \"Decrease in Systolic Blood Pressure \"). 4. The Outcome Measure Description includes information about the measurement or metric included in the Outcome Measure Title (e.g., a measure of \"participants with response\" should include a brief and informative description of the criteria for \"response\"). 5. The Outcome Measure Title and Description include a description of what will be measured, not the goal or objective of an assessment or of the study itself. Example of an inappropriate Outcome Measure : \"The aim of this project is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN DBS) in treating tics and behavioral features in patients with medically refractory Tourette 's syndrome (TS) .\" 6. The Outcome Measure Title and Description contain only information relevant to that outcome measure. 7. Each unique outcome measure is presented separately, even if some or all of the outcome measures share a common unit of measure. Examples of unique outcome measures that must be entered as separate outcome measures : (1)\"Blood Pressure\" and \"Heart Rate ,\" (2) \"Visual Analog Score for Pain\" and \"Physicians Global Assessment to Measure Quality of Life,\" (3) \"SF-36 to measure quality of life\" and \"European Organization for Researc h and Treatment of Cancer 30 -item core quality of life questionnaire (EORTC QLQ C -30)\" The following apply to the Outcome Measure Time Frame: 8. The Outcome Measure Time Frame indicates the specific time point or time points at which the outcome measure will be assessed and for which data will be presented. All time points are expressed from the participant's perspective (e.g., use \"from enrollment to end of treatment at 8 weeks\" not \"until end of study\"). Specific Time Frames also include the cutoff poin t. Examples of appropriate Outcome Measure Time Frames : \"1 year \"; \"up to 24 weeks \"; \"through study completion, an average of 1 year\" ; \"2 hours post -surgery\"; \"during hospitalization, approximately 5 days\"; \"post -intervention at Week 12.\" Examples of inappropriate Outcome Measure Time Frames : \"postoperative ,\" \"throughout the study ,\" \"through study completion ,\" \"from randomization to end of study ,\" \"every 3 weeks\" 9. Time Frames that relate to the particular time point when the intervention occurs (such a s a procedure) are described based on the timing of the intervention or event. Examples of appropriate Time Frames : \"intraoperative ,\" \"perioperative ,\" procedure\" 10. Time -to-event Time Frames include the estimated period of time over which the event is assessed (e.g., \"from the date of assignment until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any ca use, whichever comes first, assessed up to 100 months\").ClinicalTrials. gov Protocol Registration and Document Upload Quality Control Review Criteria 27 June 2018 Page 8 of 10 11. Each unique combin ation of measurement and time point is entered as a separate outcome measure (e.g., \"Change from baseline in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale at 8 weeks\" and \"Change from baseline in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale at 12 weeks\"). 12. Pharmacokinetic outcome measures (e.g., C max, AUC) rely on multiple measurements over time , so these Time Frame s may include multiple time points describing the interval s at which data are collected (e.g., \"1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours post -dose\"). 13. Measures -of-change Time Frames specify two or more time points (e.g., \"at baseline and in 6 months \"). 14. A standard unit of time is specified. 15. One-letter abbreviations are spelled out for clarity. Examples of appropriate Time Frames : \"Day 0 ,\" \"Month 3\" Examples of ina ppropriate Time Frames : \"D1,\" \"M3\" 16. The overall time period for which each outcome measure is assessed is described, rather than the specific calendar dates at which the assessment occur s. Eligibility Module Review Criteria 1. Overall Record Consistency : The Age Limits are consistent with the Eligibility Criteria and with information provided in other parts of the study record. 2. The Eligibility Criteria data element does not contain text such as \"TBD ,\" \"Pending ,\" \"N/A ,\" \"None ,\" or similar . 3.
