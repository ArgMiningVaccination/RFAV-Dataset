Between feeling a little down and feeling cold, our balance can quickly be disturbed. Why not using the best that nature can offer to take care of yourself and to prepare for the season's transition? Fall, the season when trees turn to warm colors and nature slowly prepares for the arrival of winter. Autumn also means shorter days, cooler temperatures, and more time spent indoors, away from natural light. This change puts a strain on the body; the decrease of light can cause fatigue and gloom, while the first cold weather can weaken our natural immune defenses. However, autumn fatigue can be avoided. There are number of habits and natural remedies to integrate into your daily life to help you face this time of year. - Continue to exercise In the summer we tend to be more often outside doing more physical exercise. Even though the gloomy weather of autumn may encourage us to stay indoors, it is important to continue practicing a physical exercise. Whether it is a walk in the woods, a bike ride, or any other activity, this energy expenditure will do you a world of good. Recovery after a physical effort is key, so do not forget massaging the muscles trained during the sporting activity. Certified organic, 100% pure, and natural, our [Arnica maceration oil](https://www.florihana.com/us/macerated-oils/852-567-arnica-organic-flm001.html#/795-size-100_ml) is particularly recommended after a physical effort to relax the muscles and boost recovery. To do this, warm a few drops of Arnica oil between your hands and apply to the area of your body that needs it, by circular movements. For external use only, do not swallow. - Adapt your diet to the change of season In autumn, the body needs to fill up on vitamins and Omega 3 to stay in top shape. Do not forget to eat seasonal fruit and vegetable! To recharge your battery as soon as you wake up, try this green juice recipe, seasoned with rosemary verbenone hydrosol: - 1 green apple - 1 handful of spinach leaves - 1 dash of [Organic Rosemary Verbenone Hydrolat](https://www.florihana.com/us/hydrosols/757-491-rosemary-verbenone-organic.html#/795-size-100_ml) Peel and cut the apple into pieces.

To be taken as a 3-week cure (Zahalka, 2014). - Give yourself breaks to relax As we all know, this time of year can be very hectic due to the resumption of work and school activities or the setting of new goals.
