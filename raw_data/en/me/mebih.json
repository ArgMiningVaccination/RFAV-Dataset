community, integrates a liberal arts education with experiential learning to inspire curiosity, critical thinking, creativity, personal courage and an enduring passion for learning. Our Purpose Our purpose as a college of the liberal arts and sciences is to educate people who will thrive in and contribute to the world of the future; people who are prepared to meet the personal, intellectual, and social challenges of a rapidly changing and increasingly interdependent world. Hartwick graduates will be noted as being able to thrive in a world of global interdependence in which people of the broadest range of national, ethnic, social, and personal backgrounds will interact personally and technologically. To thrive in this context will require that Hartwick students learn to: understand the world from a variety of perspectives; work constructively with people from a variety of backgrounds and life experiences; be avid learners and critical thinkers; communicate effectively and have a well-developed personal presence; be purposeful in their actions and value-based in their decisions; and know how to use information technology resources as a routine tool to enhance effectiveness. Our Values We are: a college of the liberal arts and sciences, focusing on the development of the disciplines of thinking, learning, analyzing, communicating, and values-based judgment; a relationship college, focusing on the development of a 24 hour per day, seven days per week, residential educational experience characterized by personal responsibility and collaborative relationships among faculty, students, and staff; and a future-directed college, focusing on educating people in ways that will make them effective and contributing citizens to the world of their future. Our Character By being intentional in fulfilling our values\u2014taking those actions that help us better be what we believe we should be\u2014we are a college of both quality and distinctiveness. We are a future-directed community of learners where students, faculty, and staff are mutually engaged in intellectual, social, and personal learning inside and outside of the classroom. Our curricular and co-curricular educational experience emphasizes: shared and interdependent learning; a balance of challenge and support; a caring commitment to the individual; intellectual, social, and individual rigor; the development of personal responsibility; and approaches that link theory and practice, what we term \"The Liberal Arts in Practice.\" 13 Accreditation and Affiliations Hartwick is an independent college operating under a charter granted by the Regents of the University of the State of New York.

Each has the job of designing the education he or she will experience. There is help along the way\u2014 advice from family and friends, for example, and some amount of structure established by the College and its faculty. But ultimately, the choices are made by students, and the quality and value of the college education depend heavily on those choices. This catalog describes the building blocks with which you can construct your college education at Hartwick. Before getting too deeply involved in the separate pieces, let us consider how they might fit together. First, let us look at a basic commitment of the college that will influence your design. We are convinced that the liberal arts and sciences provide the core of the intellectual development we want all our students to experience. People are sometimes confused about what \"liberal education\" means. Our modern phrase \"liberal arts and sciences\" comes from an inspiring Latin phrase that meant, roughly, \"the learning appropriate for a free person.\" People locked into narrow specializations or people interested only in preparation for their first job might find a technical education sufficient. Hartwick, as a liberal arts and sciences college, serves those who want to equip themselves for a lifetime of learning, career development, and the kind of change that characterizes the 21st century. Indeed, the intellectual capabilities of a liberal arts and sciences education are the very skills valued by employers. A liberal education is both broad and deep, allowing exploration of a wide spectrum of human knowledge and assuring study of at least one set of questions (we usually call it a \"major\") with special intensity. At Hartwick, we believe that all our students\u2014 even those who know exactly where they want to head in their careers\u2014deserve this kind of education. Employers appreciate the perspective, communication skills, and analytical abilities of liberally educated people. More importantly, such people are well prepared to live enjoyable, contributing, and fulfilling lives. Academic Advising Making the most effective use of the learning opportunities a college experience offers is a basic challenge each student faces. Hartwick provides special help in this process with its system of academic advising. All students will be assigned a faculty member as their regular academic advisor. For first-year students, every effort is made to have this advisor be a professor the student has in a Fall Term course, so that advisor and advisee come to know each other. If students declare a major, every effort will be made to match them with an advisor in that department. If a student does not declare a major, he or she will be assigned to a professional advisor in the Office of the Advising. In addition to the advisor of an undeclared student, resources are available in the Office of the Advising to assist students with choosing or declaring a major. Students must meet with their advisors prior to each course-registration period, but students are urged to visit their advisors regularly as the year progresses. Helping the student plan a challenging, satisfying, and coherent program is one of the best ways an advisor can be of assistance, but often the advisor also can discuss career options or the resources available at the College for dealing with specific problems a student may be facing. Students may change advisors as their needs or interests change and, when a major field is selected, the advisor should be from the major department. To change advisors, students complete and return the necessary form available from the Office of the Advising. Academic Calendar Hartwick's academic calendar provides a structure for the academic year designed to help students get the most out of their college experiences. In the Fall and Spring terms, students normally take 12-16 credits and have periods set aside as Reading and Examination Days to conclude their studies. January Term at Hartwick is designed to be very different from fall and spring semesters. Students enroll in a single course for the entire four-week term, usually for several hours each day. This allows for a concentrated, intensive examination of subjects often not taught during a longer semester. Whether taking a course or advanced independent study on campus or an off-campus program or internship, students are able to invest themselves completely in just one course with no distractions. Instructional Locations Hartwick's courses are taught at our main campus at One Hartwick Drive in Oneonta, NY 13820. Classes are also taught at Pine Lake located at 1894 Charlotte Creek Road in Davenport, NY 13820 and Nursing Partnership Program students complete courses at the main Bassett Healthcare located at 1 Atwell Drive in Cooperstown, NY 13326. In addition, students have many opportunities to participate in internships off campus and to conduct research independently with our faculty. Furthermore, students have the opportunity each January Term to study off campus via a J Term program through the PSGE center. 26 Components of a Degree Program Hartwick College recognizes its responsibility to help students pursue a program of study that provides both depth and breadth of understanding. In addition to demonstrating competence in at least one specialized area, graduates should have a basic, multidisciplinary education that includes an acquaintance with major alternative ways of knowing, an understanding of the cultural heritage shared by liberally educated persons, and a broad foundation for a lifetime of continued learning. Since there is no single path to this goal, students should be able to choose, in consultation with their advisors, the particular courses of study best suited to their interests and needs, within the framework of general degree requirements. Graduation Requirements Satisfactorily complete four academic years of full-time study or its equivalent, which Hartwick defines as 120 academic credits with a minimum cumulative grade point average of 2.00. At least 60 credits must be earned at Hartwick, with the final 30 credits completed as a matriculated Hartwick student. (Performance music credits beyond 12 semester hours, physical education (PHED), and WICK 101 credits do not count toward this requirement.) Fulfill the requirements of the Liberal Arts in Practice curriculum. Earn an overall average of at least 2.0 in the major program or Individual Student Program. Curricular Mission: A Commitment to Liberal Arts in Practice The central focus of the liberal arts tradition has always been on preparing individuals to face the responsibility of freedom. Indeed, the Latin artes liberales refers to the areas of study required for living as a free person. The greatest opportunity faced by free persons is also the greatest burden: Free persons must choose. Choosing well requires knowledge, understanding, and, above all, judgment. The premise of our curriculum at Hartwick College is that a liberal arts education addressing the interplay between the theoretical and the practical is the best way to develop the integrative forms of knowledge, understanding, and judgment necessary for choosing well. In establishing a curriculum for Hartwick College, we recognize profound cultural and natural diversity and interconnectedness, and thus seek to build a deeper understanding of similarities and differences across time and space; Affirm the necessity of human interaction and thus seek to develop familiarity with diverse ways of knowing and facility with diverse forms of communication; Acknowledge the significance of individual and collective actions and thus seek to foster the capacity for critical thinking, ethical action, and reflection; Take inspiration from the artifacts of human ingenuity and the beauty and workings of nature and thus seek to nurture creativity in all its varied forms; Value the transformative potential of experience, and thus seek to integrate learning and doing, both inside and outside the classroom; and Posit that inquiry, discovery and self-examination promote strength of mind and purpose over the course of a lifetime and thus seek to ignite a passion for lifelong learning. Our commitment to the Liberal Arts in Practice fosters active student participation in the academic endeavor, helping our students, as free people, develop the knowledge, understanding, and judgment needed to make meaningful contributions to present and future communities throughout the world. Electives Elective courses complete the academic program. Much creativity may be exercised in this part of the curriculum. Many students use some of these courses to complete a minor\u2014perhaps in a field related to their major, perhaps in an interdisciplinary program that cuts across many fields, such as Environmental Science and Policy. The range of possibilities is enormous. Some electives may be useful in broadening career opportunities\u2014for example, Business Administration or Computer Science courses for the Art major hoping to work in gallery administration, or courses in a foreign language for the Business Administration major interested in international business. Other electives contribute to a student's ongoing personal and intellectual development. Individual Student Programs A student whose main interests are not met by one of the standard departmental majors may design an individual program of concentration, comparable in depth of study and number of courses to departmental majors. In designing and carrying out such a program, the student will work closely with the Committee on Interdisciplinary Studies, which oversees this part of the curriculum. 27 Individual Student Programs have been developed in a wide variety of areas. Some, for example, focus on fields in which Hartwick offers programs of study but not majors, as suggested by the following recent titles: \"Photojournalism,\" \"Biomedical Informatics,\" and \"Management and Production for the Performing Arts.\" Sometimes programs are combinations of a major interest in one disciplin e with a complementary secondary specialization, or an interest that cuts across many disciplines, such as \"Scientific Writing and Illustration,\" \"Graphic Design and Communications,\" and \"International Economics.\" Some programs center on areas of concentration that lead toward specific career objectives, such as \"Human Resources Management,\" \"Political Journalism,\" \"Horticulture,\" and \"Marketing Communications.\" Occasionally programs emphasize a particular field within a discipline, such as \"Analytical Technology,\" \"Creative Writing,\" and \"Cognitive Science.\" The program of study is developed by the student in consultation with faculty members of the student's choice along with the coordinator for Individual Student Programs. The program must meet all requirements of the Liberal Arts in Practice curriculum. The student then meets with the Committee for its consideration of the proposed program, working through whatever modifications seem appropriate to the Committee. When the program is approved, the student pursues it with guidance from a program advisor selected from among the faculty by the student. Any changes in the approved program must be accepted in advance by the Committee. Students interested in developing an ISP should contact the coordinator for Individual Student Programs as early as possible. At the latest, a preliminary proposal for an Individual Student Program should be submitted to the committee during the spring term of the student's sophomore year, and a full proposal must be completed and approved by the committee before the beginning of the Fall Term of the student's junior year, unless the student receives financial aid from New York State (TAP, Regents or nursing scholarships). Recipients of such financial aid should be aware that they cannot be certified for payment after the end of the sophomore year without a declared major or an approved ISP. These students must submit ISP proposals no later than the beginning of the Spring Term of the sophomore year. Students who have an approved Individual Student Program are listed as \"ISP\" majors, and the Committee on Interdisciplinary Studies becomes their home \"department.\" They also may elect to pursue a minor in addition to the ISP major by fulfilling the requirements of any regular department. Interdisciplinary Progra ms The College offers minors or programs in the following areas, which draw from several disciplines: Cognitive Science (minor) Education (program) Environmental Science and Policy (minor) Graphic Communications (minor) Museum Studies (minor) Peace and Conflict Studies (minor) Race and Ethnic Studies (minor) Women's and Gender Studies (minor) Complete descriptions can be found in the \"Courses of Study\" section. Disciplinary Minors Hartwick encourages its students to consider adding a minor or other secondary concentration to their programs. While not required for graduation, such a group of courses can frequently help a student organize his or her electives in a way that complements a major, develops a second interest, or strengthens career preparation. Minor Requirements Requirements of different minors vary but include at least 18 credits with a cumulative average of 2.0 earned in those courses. Students wishing to declare a minor should consult the appropriate department or coordinator and notify the Office of Academic and Pre-Professional Advising as early as possible, but no later than Spring Term of the senior year. Minors are offered by most departments and are described in the departmental listings. 28 Liberal Arts in Practice Curriculum The Liberal Arts in Practice general education curriculum provides the Hartwick student with a variety of learning opportunities to inspire intellectual growth and prepare each student to contribute in meaningful ways to complex and diverse societies, communities, and organizations. The Writing Competency, Quantitative/Formal Reasoning, and Foreign Language requirements advance the student's ability to communicate and express thoughts, ideas, and relationships by diverse means. The First Year Seminar and Senior Capstone frame the student's educational journey at Hartwick, a journey encompassing both breadth and depth of knowledge. An intensive seminar designed for first year students introduces them to many of the means an d methods to be employed throughout their education. Ventures into all three divisions of academic knowledge (the Physical and Life Sciences, Arts and Humanities, and Social and Behavioral Sciences) broaden their understanding of the varied ways of knowing the world, both intellectually and experientially, as students integrate their classroom learning in one discipline with perspectives gained from other disciplines and through hands-on experience. Through a major or an Individual Student Program in a particular area of interest, students also develop significant competence culminating in a Senior Capstone, a project demonstrating mastery of that discipline. Thus by uniting learning and doing, the Liberal Arts in Practice curriculum aims to foster critical thinking, intellectual growth, delight in discovery, and social commitment to last a lifetime. Writing Competency Requirement By attaining Writing Level 4 in the Writing Competency Program, students will demonstrate the ability to write competently at the college level. In order to graduate, students at Hartwick College must demonstrate competence in writing at the college level, as defined in Writing Competency: A Handbook. Such demonstration must be made in one of two ways: By progressing to Level 4 through a sequence of courses outlined below, beginning with the course at the level at which the student was placed upon admission to the College. By achieving Level 4 in the Writing Proficiency Examination. The student may not take the examination before completing the course at the level at which he or she was placed upon admission to the College. Students admitted to Hartwick will be placed in one of four levels of competency according to results from a writing sample (placement test). The sequence of courses described below is designed to offer increasingly complex and challenging writing tasks. Accordingly, the courses must be taken in sequence. That is, a student placed at Level 1 must take English 101 before taking English 110. A student may take a Level 3 course at any time but may not receive writing credit unless he or she is at Level 3. Level 1 students needing review work in English grammar and in writing and revising short compositions will register for English 101: Writing Tutorial. Students who successfully complete English 101 will pass to Level 2. Level 2 students needing instruction in composing and developing whole essays will register for English 110: Composition. Students who earn a grade of A- or higher will pass to Level 4; those who complete 110 with a grade of C through B+ will pass to Level 3. Students receiving a grade of D- through C- will pass to Level 2b. Level 2b students passing English 110 with a grade of D- through C- and needing extended work in the writing and particularly the revision of compositions will register for English 111: Composition Workshop. Students who successfully complete English 111 will pass to Level 3. Level 3 students needing additional practice in writing and revising (but not an entire course in writing) will register for lower-level courses offered in many departments and in all divisions, and designated by a \"W\" in the class schedule. These courses feature instruction in writing within a discipline. Instructors may recommend further Level 3 course work for a student or pass the student into Level 4. The instructor will determine whether a student is passed to Level 4 at the completion of the course and will make such recommendation independent of the course grade. Level 4 students placed at Level 4 as first year students or who attain Level 4 through testing or course work are considered able to write at the college level of competency. They should maintain and sharpen their skills by taking courses that requir e essays, reports, short papers, and essay examinations. Students admitted as transfers who before entry have attained a grade of C or better in a college-level composition course will receive college credit for the course, but will be assigned to a writing level by means of testing at entry. Should review of the writing sample and, when available, SAT scores indicate that the student's writing is not yet at Level 3, such a student must take either English 110 (see above under Level 2) or English 111 (under Level 2b), which will allow the transfer student to pass to a higher writing level. Courses at Writing Level 1, 2, and 2b (English 101, 110, and 111) do not satisfy the Breadth and Integration requirement in the Humanities. 29 Quantitative/Formal Reasoning Requirement Complete a course (minimum of 3 credits) with a Quantitative or Formal Reasoning (QFR) designation that explores or makes significant use of mathematics or formal logical reasoning or uses computers for the analysis of mathematical, social-scientific, or scientific data. Foreign Language Requirement The requirement is satisf ied in one of five ways: Complete an elementary language sequence (minimum 6 credits), OR Complete one intermediate language course (minimum 3 credits), OR Complete one introductory language course (minimum 3 credits) AND the corresponding off -campus program (minimum 3 credits), OR Complete one introductory language course (minimum 3 credits) AND GLST 160 (Introduction to Global Studies) OR Complete an off -campus language immersion course (minimum 3 credits ). First Year Seminar Requirement Complete a First Year Seminar (minimum of 3 credits, enrollment cap of 20) Breadth and Integration (minimum of 27 credits) Complete at least three courses, totaling at least nine credits, in each of the College's three academic divisions: Arts and Humanities, Physical and Life Sciences, and Social and Behavioral Sciences. In the Physical and Life Sciences academic division, as part of the nine credit minimum, complete at least three credits in Chemistry or Physics and at least three credits in Biology or Geology. At least one of the courses must have a weekly laboratory component. In the Social and Behavioral Sciences academic division, as part of the nine credit minimum, complete courses from at least two different departments. In the Arts and Humanities academic division, the nine credits of courses are to be met through exploring humanities beyond the skills courses; therefore, there are two types of exclusions from the course offerings. Writing Courses at Writing Level 1, 2, and 2b (English 101, ENGL 110, and ENGL 111) do not satisfy the Breadth and Integration requirement for the Arts and Humanities. Foreign Language\u2014 Courses used to satisfy the Foreign Language Requirement may not be used to satisfy any other general education requirement, with the exception that students may meet the experiential requirement in the Arts and Humanities division with an off-campus program of a minimum of 15 days. In the Arts and Humanities and Social and Behavioral Sciences academic divisions, as part of the nine credit minimum, complete at least three credits in either an Integrative Learning Seminar (ILS) or coursework with a specifically designated Experiential Learning (EL) component. Integrative Learning Seminar Integrative learning seminars are characterized by active student engagement in course materials and research, limited enrollments, and an assumed knowledge of basic concepts in the field. Designation as an ILS is subject to the approval of the academic division. An interdisciplinary ILS may obtain divisional approval to qualify for more than one academic division, but a single course may be used to fulfill the requirement in only one academic division. Experiential Learning Experiential learning courses are characterized by active student engagement in a learning environment that expects students to apply their learning to real-life situations. Experiential learning courses include: Internships Off-Campus Programs (minimum of 15 days off campus) Coursework requiring a significant, grade-bearing, service- learning component Coursework in Studio Art, Music, Theatre, Dance Performance, or Creative Writing Coursework with a weekly laboratory requirement Coursework at Pine Lake that contains a significant, grade-bearing experiential component 30 Depth in Discipline Complete the requirements for one Primary Major Program or a student-designed Individual Student Program. A good liberal education combines breadth and depth. Along with a wide-ranging general background, it is important to have studied some field deeply and developed significant intellectual competence in a particular area of interest. While the choice of a major is sometimes influenced by particular career goals, the most important driving force behind the choice should be sincere interest. Hartwick offers a wide spectrum of major programs, any one of which could help a student prepare for a rewarding life as well as many different career paths. Some lead to the Bachelor of Arts degree and others to the Bachelor of Science degree, depending on the proportion of the program devoted to the major specialization as opposed to liberal studies. Accounting (Bachelor of Science)\u2014 CPA or General Accounting Actuarial Math (Bachelor of Science) Anthropology (Bachelor of Arts) Art (Bachelor of Arts) Art History (Bachelor of Arts) Biochemistry (Bachelor of Science) Biology (Bachelor of Arts) Business Administration (Bachelor of Science) Chemistry (Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science) Computer Science (Bachelor of Science) Creative Writing (Bachelor of Arts) Criminal Justice (Bachelor of Arts) Economics (Bachelor of Arts) Education (Certification Program\u2014see Note) English (Bachelor of Arts) Environment, Sustainability, and Society (Bachelor of Arts) Environmental Chemistry (Bachelor of Science) French (Bachelor of Arts) Geology (Bachelor of Arts) Global Studies (Bachelor of Arts) History (Bachelor of Arts) Individual Student Program (Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science) Mathematics (Bachelor of Arts) Medical Technology (Bachelor of Science) Music (Bachelor of Arts) Music Education (Bachelor of Science) Nursing (Bachelor of Science) Philosophy (Bachelor of Arts) Physics (Bachelor of Arts) Political Science (Bachelor of Arts) Psychology (Bachelor of Arts) Public Health (Bachelor of Arts) Religious Studies (Bachelor of Arts) Sociology (Bachelor of Arts) Spanish (Bachelor of Arts) Theatre Arts (Bachelor of Arts) Senior Capstone Complete (minimum of 3 credits) a departmentally (or ISP) determined Senior Capstone.

These divisional groups indicate characteristic approaches to learning: The Arts and Humanities generally use the approach of studying human documents and artistic achievements. Courses of study offered by departments in the Division of Arts and Humanities include Art, Art History, Classics, English, French, Music, Philosophy, Religious Studies, Spanish, and Theatre Arts. The Physical and Life Sciences provide experience in the scientific method as exemplified by laboratory and field research. Courses of study offered by departments in the Division of Physical and Life Sciences include Biochemistry, Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science and Geology, Mathematics, Medical Technology, Nursing, and Physics. The Social and Behavioral Sciences provide the experiences of gathering and analyzing social data. Courses of study offered b y departments in the Division of Social and Behavioral Sciences include Accounting, Anthropology, Business Administration, Economics, Education, Finance, History, Political Science, Psychology, and Sociology. Courses of study offered by departments appear alphabetically by discipline in this catalog supplement, along with major curricular requirements, a description of the discipline and current faculty. Course Numbering: 100-level courses are generally introductory to a field or discipline. These courses require a depth of study, student responsibility, and independence commensurate with initial work at the college level. 200-level courses normally require a greater depth of study and student responsibility in the acquisition of knowledge and resources and in the mastery of techniques and methods than is demanded in 100-level courses. 300- and 400-level courses are usually designed for the major or minor and presuppose command of methods as well as factual and theoretical knowledge appropriate to the discipline. Courses in the 100-199 and 200-299 series generally should be completed in the freshman and sophomore year s. Departmental Distinction Grades for all courses required for the major (including those from other departments, if applicable) are used to calculate the average in a major for Departmental Distinction. See Policies and Procedures for complete Departmental Distinction requirements. The College reserves the right to change this section of the catalog without notice and cancel any course which has an enrollment of fewer than eight students at the end of the pre-registration period. 37 Accounting Accounting's focus on the preparation, communication, and use of economic information for decision making are especially relevant in an information age. Accounting-based information is the central means of communicating with internal and external stakeholders. It is the language of business. Hartwick's demanding accounting program develops and stresses critical thinking, analytical ability, and effective communication. At its core is decision making. The program's goal is to develop well-rounded individuals who understand the role of accounting within society, possess a solid accounting foundation, and can apply their education to ethical decision making. Graduates should be able to adjust to a dynamic, constantly changing economic environment, to recognize the need for continual learning, and to assist the profession in responding to challenges. Business leaders with strong accounting backgrounds have a significant competitive advantage. Many chief executive officers are certified public accountants (CPAs) or certified management accountants (CMAs). As commercial, industrial, and governmental organizations increase in complexity and international activity, they will seek accounting graduates with solid quantitative backgrounds and refined communicative ability: the combination found in our interdisciplinary accounting program and Hartwick's distinctive Liberal Arts in Practice requirements. The two majors within the Accounting Program are the Accounting-Certified Public Accountant (CPA) major (intended for those interested in licensure as a CPA) and the Accounting-General major (intended for those interested in internal reporting or graduate education as a path to licensure as a CPA). Minors in Accounting and Finance also are offered. The use of computers is integrated throughout the accounting curriculum that utilizes the Internet for research, spreadsheets for analysis, and accounting software programs currently used by small business and accounting professionals. The Accounting-CPA major has financial accounting and external reporting as its central focus. It investigates the questions and ethical dilemmas that underlie generally accepted accounting principles by studying the preparation, communication, and analysis of accounting information. It is a four-year licensure qualifying program, registered with the New York State Education Department Office of Professional Licensing. Registration identifies program graduates as having completed the 150 hours of designated academic credit required for CPA licensure in New York. It expedites CPA exam registration and licensure and includes the NYS licensur e required Financial, Managerial, Taxation and Auditing Accounting courses. The Accounting-General major allows students more flexibility within the accounting discipline. Students complete 120 hours of study which may focus on management accounting or taxation. Accounting-General majors who are considering CPA licensure should include Auditing in their major's electives. The Accounting minor offers advantages to all Hartwick students. It is a natural complement to majors in Economics, Computer Science, Business Administration, and Mathematics, among others. The minor helps prepare students for careers in business or in organizations that interact with business. It also provides an excellent foundation for students planning to pursue graduate study in business administration. A benefit of the interdisciplinary nature of the Accounting program is the ease in double-majoring (e.g., Accounting and Economics, Computer Science, or Business Administration) or minoring in a related discipline (e.g., Economics, Finance, or Business Administration). For additional information, contact the department chair. Faculty Stephen A. Kolenda, CPA; Dan Vo, Ph.D.; Priscilla Z.

The study of actuarial mathematics as part of liberal arts and science enables students not only to learn the necessary background to manage institutional financial risk but to develop their ability to think logically, solve problems, express themselves precisely and gain a cultural appreciation of the discipline. Upon completion of the Actuarial Mathematics major, students will be prepared for two of the examinations of the Society of Actuaries. Actuarial mathematics majors must complete a specified core of courses in Mathematics, Economics, Business Administration, an d Finance. The requirements begin with a sequence of calculus and linear algebra in Mathematics, topics in microeconomics and macroeconomics in Economics, introduction to business in Business Administration and financial accounting in Accounting, generally during their first two years. These courses provide the foundation for upper level courses. To obtain a necessary background for actuarial science, majors take courses of mathematical probability and statistics sequence and differential equation/mathematical modeling in Mathematics, econometrics in Economics, finance in Business Administration, and financial modeling and investment analysis in Finance. A required Senior Capstone Seminar in Mathematics involves supervised independent study in actuarial science with written presentations and a final oral presentation. Due to excessive overlaps in the requirements, students may not pursue dual majors in Mathematics and Actuarial Mathematics. Students who wish to pursue a 3-year degree program in the actuarial math major should consult the math department chair before the start of the first year. Incoming students are administered an algebra placement test and, on the basis of the results, are advised which mathematics courses would be most appropriate for their algebra backgrounds. Pre-Calculus Mathematics (MATH 120) may be selected by students who need a stronger background in algebra before they begin the calculus sequence. For students with exceptional mathematics backgrounds, advanced placement credit in calculus will be granted on the basis of Advanced Placement Test scores. Advanced placement without credit also may be granted on the basis of consultation with the department faculty. Note: Because of the significant overlap in requirements for the Mathematics and Actuarial Mathematics majors, no student may be credited with both majors.

Teasing out the origins of Homo sapiens from fossilized bones, discovering the common humanity among different cultures, exploring why contemporary peoples do what they do\u2014all are part of this wide-ranging and fascinating field. Anthropology at Hartwick addresses three major sub-areas: cultural anthropology, biological anthropology and archaeology. Cultural anthropologists explore the varying beliefs and practices of the world's societies, both non-Western and Western, in contemporary and historic times. Biological anthropologists investigate the interaction of culture and biology in the evolution of and current biological diversity within the human family and our nearest relatives. Archaeologists reconstruct the ways of life of past societies by excavating and interpreting their artifacts and other material remains. Thus, anthropology bridges the natural sciences, the social sciences and the humanities. The study of anthropology can broaden students' perspectives on and understanding of other people and cultures as well as their own. Courses in the discipline are valuable components of an education designed to prepare students for a future characterized by growing social and global interdependence. Students majoring in anthropology take a core of preliminary courses followed by seminars that survey anthropology's particularly rich historical and theoretical insights. Students may use electives to specialize in one of the three major sub-areas and in a particular culture area of the world (e.g. Native North America, Africa, Europe, Asia, South America). At the philosophical level, students are guided toward an awareness of the ethnocentrism implicit in our own Western ways of thinking as well as toward a sensitivity to the traditions of other, non-Western cultures. In addition, all students are encouraged to master the more practical anthropological skills in courses dealing directly with field, museum, lab, computer and other analytical methods. The department offers a number of special opportunities: a field school in the archaeological excavation; off- campus programs in other countries; courses, training and exhibitions dealing with the many unique collections of North American Indian artifacts found in The Yager Museum; and the Hardy Chair Lecture Program featuring world-renowned anthropologists. Students especially interested in museum work can complete Hartwick's Museum Studies minor in addition to the Anthropology major or minor. Hartwick's anthropology graduates have successfully taken on a diverse range of career challenges from law and medical school , business, education, international relations and government service to archaeological excavation, public health careers, and doctoral programs in anthropology. They have used their understanding of people and their similarities and differences to pursue careers in museums, community relations, journalism, human resources management and social services. Whatever their specific goals, however, anthropology students emerge with a conscious appreciation of and sensitivity to the critical issues of cross-cultural differences, as our society engages in increasingly intensive relationships with peoples of other cultures and languages. Faculty Connie Anderson; David Anthony; Michael Woost; Jason Antrosio 44 Anthropology Courses 105 Introduction to Anthropology (4 credits) An introduction to anthropology and the study of human culture.

(ILS) 367 Anthropology of Violence and State Terror (3 credits) This course examines the \"continuum of violence\" that stretches from the intimate context of domestic violence, to the more obvious forms of state terror and genocide. Emphasis is given to: 1) the ways in which violence takes on meaning in everyday life; 2) the ways in which violence is supported and reproduced materially and ideologically by the state and its many agents, and by anti-state agents. These context of violence will be examined through case studies and analyses produced by anthropologists. The overall goal of the course is not simply to read through an inventory of violence, but to see how an understanding of the \"continuum of violence\" can provide tools for making a difference in the world. (ILS) 381 Anthropological Forensics (3 credits) This course is a bare-bones introduction to what we can learn from human bones. Students who hope to attend graduate school in forensic anthropology or who wish to take an intensive summer course can benefit from working with the bones, learning to identify them; they will learn how to identify age and sex, fractures and other injuries, diseases, etc. and how to estimate height in order to identify individuals and/or compile information about past populations. 387 Ethnographic Methods (4 credits) Problems, theories and techniques of anthropological fieldwork.

(ILS) 405 Capstone in Anthropological Issues (3 credits) This course focuses on contemporary anthropological theory, seeking to introduce students to the process and emergence of anthropological discovery and debate. The emphasis is on process rather than content, with three primary features: (1) concentrating on anthropology that has been produced in the last decade; (2) relating student interests to this material through an independent research project or commentary; and (3) discussing materials that have been assembled by students, especially in the latter portions of the course. Each version of the course will be individually titled under a broad contemporary issue theme. It is, therefore, possible that students could take this course two times, with instructor permission. It is assumed that students will already be familiar with the history of anthropological thought, as well as an understanding of the theories and methods from the major anthropological sub disciplines. Prerequisites: Junior standing and at least 20 completed credits in Anthropology. 421 Field Research in Archaeology (4 credits) Excavation and analysis of archaeological materials. Prerequisites: ANTH 105, ANTH 225, or permission of instructor. (EL) 490 Senior Thesis in Anthropology (3 credits) Student- initiated project of substantial scope done under faculty guidance.

Art challenges each of us to discover and invent ways to communicate ideas through visual forms. Art speaks to us about the past, helps us to confront the present, and prepare for the future. Art encourages us to understand and explore a vast range of traditional and non-traditional ideas, materials and forms. Students may choose from two majors in Art or in Art History. Both of these programs culminate in a Bachelor of Arts degree. The department also offers an Art minor, Art History minor, minor in Documentary Photography, and minor in Graphic Communications. The Major in Art Hartwick offers a unique opportunity for art majors: a comprehensive \"art school\" approach within a small liberal arts college. Whether you're looking for a career as a maker, educator, gallery owner, auction consultant, arts administrator, curator, or artist, as a Hartwick art student you will get the hands-on experience you need to succeed. The Art Major includes 5 fundamentals courses totaling 12 credits and five courses in Art History totaling 15 credits. These courses should be completed by the end of the freshman year. In addition, one concentration of 12 credits with one 200, 300, and 400 level course and one concentration of 8 credits with one 200 and 300 level course are required in any two of the following studio areas: ceramics, digital art and design, glassblowing, painting, printmaking, photography and sculpture. During the fall of the second year, declared Art majors are required to participate in the Sophomore Review, which helps them assess their individual progress and goals within the major. The foundation courses in Art must be completed successfully before the student majoring in Art may participate in the Junior Review, a two-week exhibition with group critique held in Foreman Gallery, Anderson Center for the Arts. Successful completion of the Junior Review and fall enrollment in ART411 Art Theory in Practice is required before an Art major may begin the Senior Project. Art 411 Art Theory and Practice and Art 490 Senior Project in Art are required. The senior project is to be an exhibition of original works, normally earning four credits. The exhibition is held in the Foreman Gallery at the end of the Spring Term senior year. The Major in Art History The major in Art History is designed for the student interested in researching and writing about the history of ideas through the study of works of art and their makers. This program includes three core Art History survey courses, normally taken in the first three terms. The surveys serve as the foundation for six additional Art History courses required for the major, which introduce the student to the discipline of Art History through an investigation of a variety of historical styles, techniques, and ideas. Art History majors also are required to take eight credits of Studio Art courses. This experiential learning enables the student to directly engage skills and concepts used by artists, and to understand how different materials and tools affect the creative process. Art History majors will also achieve reading competency in a foreign language. This is generally achieved through a two-course beginning language sequence (culture courses do not fulfill this requirement). The required art history capstone comprises a Research and Methods course (taken in the Spring of the junior year) and the Senior Thesis (completed in the Fall of the senior year), and culminates in a symposium in which seniors present their research to the Art and Art History faculty. The department also offers a varied schedule of art events, including visiting artist and art historian lectures, art films and art exhibitions, which are designed as part of the student's education. Studio and Art History majors are required by department policy to attend out- of-class events sponsored by the department. A number of special study opportunities offered by the department further enrich the art program at Hartwick. Individualized instruction in studio classes gives students the opportunity to work closely with professional artists. The full-time faculty is joined each semester by resident artists-specialists who teach courses in such areas as glassblowing and drawing\u2014and by prestigious visiting artists who conduct occasional workshops or lectures. Past visiting artists have included Andy Warhol, Richard Artschwager, Nanette Carter, Steve Currie, Fred Escher, Robert Fichter, Martha Madigan, Duane Michals, Olivia Parker, Sal Romano, Juan Sanchez, Paul Soldner, Kay Walking Stick, John Wood, Donna Dennis, Susan Unterberg, Michael Bramwell, Alvaro Garcia, Suzanne Bocanegra, Niki Berg, John Moore, Yong Soon Min, James Luna, Ik Jung Kang, Tom Nussbaum, and Sandy Skoglund. Other special opportunities include department-sponsored study programs in Europe. In addition, students may do advanced work or independent study with a professional in a medium or area of special interest. They also may intern with professional artists or art historians in a variety of fields including book illustration, advertising, photojournalism, gallery and museum management, and art 48 history research. Students interested in curating exhibitions for museums or galleries are encouraged to gain experience thro ugh internships supervised by appropriate department faculty, or by taking museum studies courses offered through The Yager Museum of Art & Culture. Interested students are encouraged to consider completing the interdisciplinary Museum Studies Minor. All majors in the department take courses in other disciplines as part of their liberal arts and sciences education. The background and experience gained by students of art and art history at Hartwick has enabled them to begin careers in a wide range of art-related fields. Others pursue graduate study at such institutions as Otis Art Institute, Columbia University, Rochester Institute of Technology, Syracuse University, Washington University, Pratt Institute, Rutgers University, Massachusetts College of Art, New York University, Hunter College, the University of Pittsburgh, American University, St. Andrew's University, State University of New York at Albany, Columbus College of Art and Design, Drexel University, and San Francisco College of the Arts. Potential Art majors are not required to submit a portfolio for review. However, it is recommended.

Because the formal elements (line, shape, value, texture, color, etc.) are investigated more deeply, emphasis is placed upon the creative pursuit of compositional variety, visual cohesiveness, and the significant issues of content. Images and issues from a wide range of cultural, historical, and contemporary contexts are examined. Professional presentation of completed work is included. This is a core course offered for art majors. Those who declare later should take Art 113 as soon as possible in their academic career. Suitable for non-majors. (EL) 115 2-Dimensional Design (2 credits) Using black and white media as well as color paint, students explore basic concepts in 2D design during this seven-week course. The formal elements, their qualities and interactions (line, shape, value, texture, mass, color, pictorial space, etc.) are investigated in the creative pursuit of compositional variety, visual cohesiveness, and issues of meaningful content. Images and issues from a wide range of perceptual, cultural, historical, and contemporary contexts will be examined. Recommended for non-majors or those with little previous experience as well as those who declare the studio major after their first semester at Hartwick. Suitable for non-majors. (EL) 116 Time & Virtual Space (2 credits) This art fundamental covers issues such as image manipulation, time, virtual space and presentation and promotion of one's art work online.

Art majors should take this course during their first year or immediately following the declaration of a studio art major or minor. Offered three times a year. Suitable for non- majors. (EL) 165 3-Dimensional Design (2 credits) In this course, students investigate basic three-dimensional design components such as line, color, mass, form, structure, and surface. Students experience the design process through the synthesis of drawing and fabrication of three-dimensional forms using paper, wood, plaster and mixed media. Participants learn to use hand tools and power equipment in the execution of the projects. This is a core course. Art majors should take this course during their first year or immediately following the declaration of a studio art major or minor. Suitable for non- majors. (EL) 180 Drawing and 2D Design (4 credits) A multidisciplinary approach is taken as students learn the basic design elements and principles common to all two-dimensional art, while also developing many basic drawing skills. The elements and principles will be explored through reading, lecture, discussion and exercises; this design vocabulary will be put to use in discussion, critique, and written assignments. By integrating these concepts into drawing projects students will learn to put the theory into practice. Students will explore the possibilities of drawing materials by making compositions from observation and from the imagination. They will learn to render basic formal elements (line, shape, value, color, texture, mass, color) as they investigate perspective, composition, and pictorial space. This course fulfills the ART 113 & 115 pre-requisites for further study in the Art Departmen t. Offered yearly. No prerequisites. Suitable for non-majors. (EL) 49 212 Drawing/The Figure (4 credits) Drawing from the human form, students interpret the structure, anatomy, movement, mass, volume, and weight of the human figure in various two- dimensional media, emphasizing expressive and design elements. Prerequisite: Art 113 and 115 or 180. This course is an alternative core requirement for studio art majors. Offered in J Term. (EL) 213 Digital Art & Design I: Intro to Digital Media (4 credits) This is an introductory course to digital media with an emphasis on the medium as a vehicle for creative expression. The course introduces the three main aspects found within digital media; Print media, Time based media and 3D Design. During the term we will investigate image, video and web applications such as Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Premiere, and 123D Design. The class will consider digital media's effect on society through appropriation, the loop, remixing, the mashup, truth vs. perception and virtual memory, as well as other contemporary and traditional ideas that apply to the sphere of digital media. Central to these issues, and the focal point of this course, is the impact of digital media on American culture. Digital images, video and the web are important devices for communication across all disciplines. The information obtained in this course will be invaluable for anyone who wishes to present information through the digital medium. Offered yearly. Suitable for non-majors. (EL) 216 Digital Art & Design II: Graphic Design (4 credits) An intermediate course in digital media with an emphasis on graphic design and the printed image as a vehicle for creative expression.

This rapidly growing field of study includes the investigation of chemical changes in disease, drug action, and other aspects of medicine as well as in nutrition, genetics and agriculture. The work being done in biochemistry in terms of medical, pharmaceutical and genetic engineering research will have increasing impact on our society. It is imperative, therefore, that people involved in research and businesses in these areas not only are capable scientists, but are educated to deal with moral and ethical questions arising from the advance of biochemical knowledge. The study of biochemistry as part of a liberal arts and sciences education fosters the development of the broad perspective and analytical abilities necessary to deal with such questions. Biochemistry functions under the direction of the departments of biology and chemistry, and students seeking additional information should contact the chair of either department. Requirements for a major in biochemistry include courses in biology, chemistry, and biochemistry as well as auxiliary courses in mathematics and physics. A required senior research project involves laboratory and library work, interpretation of data, and oral and written reports of the results. In addition to the independent research required for their senior project, biochemistry majors often assist with faculty research or do collaborative research with a professor. Biochemical advances in the knowledge of the action of natural hormones and antibiotics promise to aid in the further development of pharmaceuticals. In addition, discoveries resulting from biochemical research, including work being done in medical, pharmaceutica l and genetic engineering, continue to open up new frontiers. Hartwick's major in biochemistry offers excellent preparation for entry- level positions in biochemistry research or graduate work in the field. Students interested in attending medical school also obtain an exceptionally good science background through a major in biochemistry. Faculty/Coordinator Andrew J.

Students who major in biology will be prepared for a broad range of careers, from teaching biology at the secondary or college level to applied research in industry or government. Many biology graduates continue their education in graduate school or professiona l programs in medicine, dentistry, veterinary science, physical therapy, and other pre-allied health fields. Hartwick biology majors are immersed in a program that uses hands-on research as the primary method to learn modern biology. The program gives students the opportunity to build a background in the main biological disciplines including physiology, genetics, development, molecular biology, microbiology, zoology, botany, ecology, and evolution. Students also learn about the biological characteristics of a variety of organisms from mammals to microbes. For students majoring in other disciplines, courses in biology can acquaint them with the language and methods of scientific inquiry in areas such as human biology, emerging infectious diseases, and animal behavior. Biology students can also seek a certificate in secondary-school teaching by taking the required education courses in addition to the biology major. Majors begin exploring biology during three introductory, laboratory-based courses: BIOL 101, BIOL 202, and BIOL 203. The first course, Biology in Practice (BIOL 101), emphasizes the processes by which biological knowledge is discovered and analyzed in a variety of contemporary topics. BIOL 202 Concepts of Biology: Biological Information and its companion course, BIOL 203 Concepts of Biology: Energy and Resources provide students with background knowledge for upper-level biology courses. Upper-level biology courses are organized into three core areas that represent the full range of modern biology: Cell and Molecular Biology, Organismal Biology, and Ecology and Evolution. Students must complete a minimum of 21 credits of upper-level coursework that includes at least one lab course from each core area, one organismal diversity (D) course and one plant (P) course. These courses can be taken in any sequence. Biology majors also complete courses in general chemistry and organic chemistry, physics, and mathematics. They may choose to do internships and independent studies in fields related to their special interests and career plans. Our laboratory facilities include centers for biotechnology, environmental science and policy, the Amphibian Research Laboratory, and other laboratories well equipped for student-faculty collaborative research. Students may be trained to use a variety of research tools including spectrophotometers, phase/fluorescence microscopes, computer-assisted thermocyclers, computer-interfaced physiographs, and a variety of field equipment that permits the capture and handling of live organisms. Also available for student-faculty research are a greenhouse, the Hoysradt Herbarium, a tissue-culture laboratory, a histology laboratory, and a microscopy facility with scanning and transmission electron microscopes. The Robert R. Smith Environmental Field Laboratory at the Pine Lake Environmental Campus and adjacent Robert V. Riddell State Park provide an opportunity for the study of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Tropical Biology Biology majors can gain experience in field studies of several tropical ecosystems during several off-campus January-term courses: The Bahamas, Costa Rica, Thailand, and Madagascar. One or more of these courses are usually offered every year. Students who take an off-campus course in one of these locations may choose to return a second time to perform a special project such as an independent study, internship, or senior project under the guidance of a faculty member. Robert R. Smith Environmental Field Laboratory at Pine Lake The research facility at the Pine Lake Environmental Campus and adjacent Robert V. Riddell State Park provides an excellent opportunity to study local ecosystems in close proximity to the main campus: about 2,500 acres of a mixed-deciduous forest, a 12-acre lake, a spruce-tamarack bog, swamps, and streams. The state-funded R.R. Smith Field Laboratory provides laboratory space for classes as well as student-faculty collaborative research projects involving birds, amphibians, fish, arthropods, and plants. Faculty Mary E.

Students learn that business management involves multiple elements, in surprising mixtures, at any moment. A finance problem may well include elements of strategy and decisions about new business locations\u2014traditionally material covered in other separate courses. A manufacturing problem may include issues of human resources, accounting, and organizational development. Many of our courses feature business simulations, case studies and projects\u2014all of which require much thought and effort. Successful students learn how to face challenges, analyze risky situations and make informed decisions. Most importantly, they learn the implications of living with the outcomes of their decisions and that decisions made in today's business environment often do not turn out as expected. Much of a student's work occurs in teams. Business administration best practices suggest that teamwork and intense interaction with co-workers are essential. Activities that demand interpersonal skills, team building, communication, leading and following help students learn how to work with their colleagues. The traditional approach to business education, which depends on theories focused at specific parts of business administration, is not the approach we take. We believe that students will better understand how business works if they learn it as it is lived-in an interrelated and unpredictable way. The major begins with BUSA 101 Introduction to Business, normally taken in the freshman year. Here, students learn the major functional areas of business. Running a simulated company and competing against other student-run companies or analyzing an existing company through public data bases and personal interviews may be part of this experience. Other required introductor y courses in Accounting and Economics, are often taken in the freshman year. In the sophomore year, students are encouraged to take core courses in Marketing, Finance, and Organizational Behavior. In the junior and senior years students complete four electives of their choice (at least three of which must be 300- or 400-level BUSA courses; one may be 400-level in ACCO, FINA, or ECON). Finally, students take BUSA 480, Business Policy and Strategy, the program's capstone course. Faculty Stephen A. Kolenda; Pauline Anthony Vennero; Dan Vo; Priscilla Z.

The study of chemistry gives students a working knowledge of chemical principles allowing them to perform chemical experiments; initiate and sustain research projects; and to think abstractly, conceptualizing reactions and relationships as they analyze data and draw conclusions. The student gains an appreciation for the methods and spirit of modern science. The Chemistry Department, whose program is approved by the American Chemical Society's Committee on Professional Training, offers Chemistry majors two tracks of study: Bachelor of Science : This track is recommended for students anticipating graduate study in chemistry or careers in industrial chemistry and normally is taken for departmental certification to the American Chemical Society. Bachelor of Arts : this track offers a broader general education, which has fewer required courses in the major program. It is recommended for students desiring careers in areas where chemistry knowledge is useful but not necessarily the main focus, like secondary education, health professions or law. Students pursuing either track obtain a broad base in chemistry through required courses in analytical, inorganic, organic and physical chemistries, biochemistry, mathematics and physics. Upper level courses, including an original senior research project, enable students to probe more deeply into specific areas. Majors in the B.S. and B.A. programs complete a year-long senior thesis research project, which culminates in oral and written reports of their findings. The senior research project is full-time during January Term. The research projects may be carried out on campus or at an approved off-campus research facility. The department faculty believe strongly that experimental work and research are central in the development of a scientist and regard laboratory study as the strongest aspect of the Chemistry program. To facilitate such study, modern equipment and instruments are used by all Chemistry students in laboratory work beginning in their first year and continuing throughout their college caree r. To further promote the development of research skills, students are encouraged to participate as early as possible in ongoing faculty research projects and to design their own projects as their abilities increase. In addition, there are opportunities for collaborative research or internships in nearby university, hospital, and industrial laboratories. Majors also may take advantage of internships in a variety of career fields that require a knowledge of chemistry. Chemistry majors have a wide range of career options available to them. Bachelor of Science majors may opt directly for careers in industry in areas such as chemical analysis, pollution control, research and development in manufacturing, and product quality control. They also may pursue advanced study in chemistry, which can lead to a wide range of careers in research, college teaching or industrial management. Majors with a bachelor of Arts may choose such careers as environmental analysis, industrial sales, business administration, geochemistry, high school teaching, art conservation, and political consulting. Alternately, one may pursue professional studies in optometry, dentistry, medicine, engineering, and law. Faculty Andrew J. Piefer (Chair); Zsuzsanna Balogh-Brunstad; John McMahon; Catherine E.

As computers have become valuable tools in nearly every field, it is important that those involved in their development and use understand not only the technology but also the human needs they can serve and the greater implications for society. The study of computers within the framework of a liberal arts and sciences education can provide this understanding. In addition, students majoring in other disciplines will find a knowledge of computers useful in their future careers\u2014whether they plan to become educators or scientists, artists or economists. And working with computers can strengthen logic and problem-solving skills that will prove valuable in both their personal and professional lives. The major in Computer Science has been completely reimagined to prepare students for the modern computing world they will experience after graduation. What is your interest in the computer field? The Computer Science major at Hartwick College will prepare you to do more than you may have thought possible. It is for the student who wants to work on the cutting edge in developing the software necessary to run the computers of tomorrow, but also for the student that is looking to become a cyber-security professional or anything in-between. Students develop proficiency through the hands-on approach utilized by the faculty of the Computer Science department. Liberal arts in practice is what we stand behind and students will develop a broad and deep understanding of computer security, operating systems, computer architecture, programming languages, and database concepts just to name a few areas. Electives are chosen from exciting topics such as PC systems, computer ethics, parallel processing, artificial intelligence, microprocessors, mobile development, and optimization techniques. As a small department, the faculty members have the ability to quickly create new topics courses to meet current student interests. The Computer Science major culminates with a required senior project that involves independent study in a selected area related to the focus of a student's major and future career plans. Courses in the humanities and social and behavioral sciences complement study in the Computer Science program. Students graduate understanding not only computers, but people, and how people and machines can work together to solve problems. Majors are encouraged to do internships that provide experience in the application of theoretical knowledge to real-life situations. The Computer Science department has internship co-op programs with several large businesses in the area to ensure that students get the experience they need to succeed. (While strongly recommended by the department, internships are not counted as one of the courses required for the major or minor.) The Computer Science department offers students the option of completing a Cyber-Security track in the Computer Science major. By completing the major with some additional conditions met, students can set a focus to their studies that will help to prepare them for the exciting field of computer security. Unlike a traditional list of additional courses that students must take, this track allows students to approach the existing courses in the major with a mind towards the security field, while the requirements for the CompTIA Security+ certification and a security-based thesis project provide students with the skills and experience necessary to move into the security field after graduation. To enhance the study of computer science at Hartwick, students in the major have access to the CISC Resource Center, affectionately known as the Clubhouse, which contains powerful servers loaded with lots of RAM, SSD hard drives, fast graphics cards, and th e latest operating systems and software. The Resource Center is used for upper level class work and advanced development projects, as well as a place for Computer Science students to socialize or have a quiet place to work. Interested in the three-year degree option at Hartwick College? The major in Computer Science can be completed in three years for students looking to reduce the overall cost of their education, or seeking to graduate as quickly as possible. The courses in the major have been structured to allow students the freedom to choose between the compressed three-year or the more traditional four-year option. Incoming students should plan to discuss their choice with their department advisor to ensure that all requirements are met for each semester. Some Hartwick graduates with a major in Computer Science have gone on to do graduate study in their fields before beginning their careers. Others have begun work immediately in a variety of industries and businesses, in careers such as systems analysis, applications programming, computer security, database management, and project management. Violation of the College Computer Use and Abuse Policy or misuse of College or Departmental computing resources can result in disciplinary action, including, but not limited to, dismissal from the major.

With a major in Criminal Justice, one will be able to: 1) Identify, apply, and evaluate traditional and contemporary criminological theories. 2) Describe and understand modern patterns of crime, victimization, and punishment in the United States. 3) Investigate issues related to criminology using analytical methods. 4) Consider the ramifications of criminal activity, punishment, and incarceration on society in general as well as on specific subsections of society. With a focus on some of the most cutting-edge issues in criminological research, our major offers courses on policing, corrections, juvenile delinquency, and many other sub-topics such as white-collar crime and political corruption. Additionally, we bring in outside scholars and practitioners to discuss key issues related to criminology. Through it all, our professors listen to students and work to incorporate their interests and goals into the broader curriculum of the program through outside speakers, internship opportunities, or one-on-one research projects. Notably, the major situates itself in a Post-Ferguson context. We understand the heightened racial context of policing and the criminal justice system, and seek to take that into consideration in our understanding of the law. Courses for this major will take into account news stories, current debates, and recent literature on criminology, securing your understanding of classic and contemporary issues. Finally, while we are primarily driven by a focus on sociological/criminological theory, we also know that an important aspect of one's post-college life is their career. With that in mind, when we teach, we teach towards practical, hands-on applications. A major in criminal justice does not train you for one specific task, but instead prepares you for a variety of careers in the criminal justice. Those who graduate with a Criminal Justice major will have the knowledge and skills to begin careers at local, state, or federal levels in the form of police officers, probation officers, correctional officers, victim advocates, and related careers. Alternatively, students will be prepared to continue their studies in graduate programs in sociology, criminal justice, criminology, or law. Faculty Reid M. Golden; Cecelia Walsh-Russo; Elena Chernyak; Ryan Ceresola Adjunct Faculty Denise Newvine, MSW, Amber Cohen Criminal Justice Courses 110 Introduction to Criminal Justice (same as SOCI 285) (3 credits) This course is designed to introduce students to the American criminal justice system and the role of the police, the courts, and correctional facilities within that system. It focuses on the history and the primary duties of our justice system in America while briefly introducing conceptions of justice as well as definitions of, measurement of, and causes of crime.

The program is selective, as it aspires to train future leaders in education. Hartwick's education program is based on four axioms: 1) Effective pre-service teachers show competence in their academic major by maintaining a GPA of 3.0 or better, 2) Hartwick's Liberal Arts in Practice curriculum firmly grounds students in the liberal arts, 3) Effective teacher training operates from research-based principles of teaching-learning, and 4) Effective teachers integrate those principles into meaningful experiences in classrooms. Hands-on teaching experiences are a central part of Hartwick's education program. There are many effective ways of learning and the Department of Education offers a variety of options to education students including: study abroad, alternative/multicultural/special education mini- practica, field experience, and directed studies with professors. We encourage students to design, develop, and implement an educational program that is consistent with their interests and long-term professional goals. Our Mission : A commitment to social change. The Hartwick College Teacher Education Program prepares teacher candidates to begin their careers with a foundation in research- based learning theory and instructional practices, a commitment to meeting and honoring the educational needs of diverse learners and a dedication to environmental and social justice in schools and society. Our department takes for granted that education is the primary means to life success. Therefore, schools must mitigate against the conditions that threaten equal opportunity and academic achievement for all children regardless of race, ethnicity, ability, religion, income, gender identity or sexual orientation. If schools are to adequately fulfill this responsibility, then teacher training programs play an important role in exposing prospective teachers to the sociocultural issues relevant to the task. Beyond developing a commitment to social justice, students are expected to maintain academic excellence, display a passion for teaching and possess high professional dispositions. The Education Department aspires to prepare educators who: Demonstrate competency in their chosen content/major area. Possess knowledge about the social, political, cultural, psychological, philosophical and moral dimensions of teaching. Demonstrate the dispositions of a professional educator which provide the foundation for competent teaching. Are equipped with an initial repertoire of skills for applying research-based teaching and learning strategies, including the ability to integrate new and emerging technologies. Are prepared to begin teaching in varied settings, and provide diverse learners with opportunities to reach their full potential.

The creative writing program's mission is to develop in its students the ability to apply their acquired literary knowledge to the practice of the art and craft of writing in the literary genres. We are preparing our graduates for fields of endeavor for which critical thinking, creativity, and effective writing will be essential skills throughout their lifetimes. The love of words and an informed appreciation of aesthetic design in the creative use of language form the basis of literary study. That study emphasizes the rich heritage and diversity of American, British, and selected Anglophone literatures cultures. Department faculty teach a disciplined approach to reading this literature and writing about it from a wide range of critical and theoretical perspectives. Students come to realize that language and imagination can create worlds that, like ours, delight, disturb, and challenge. The study of literature, therefore, helps students understand the world in which they live and their places in it. Exploring our diverse literary heritage requires students to engage in a sensitive, subtle search for meanings. Through analysis, debate, critique, and dissent, they become better able to formulate and express their own ideas. The study of literature reminds us that all people have voices and that much of our greatest literature has articulated as well as challenged prevailing cultural norms. The individual's encounter with literature has always been a crucial part of the process of transformation, of self-definition; for poems, stories, novels and plays record our blindness, our follies, and our crimes just as surely as they record our insights, our virtues and, occasionally, our genius. We study literature, literary theory, writing, and cultu re-history not just to affirm our beliefs and traditions, but to examine them critically. In keeping with its emphasis on written expression, the department offers a variety of courses in creative and expository writing. Creative writing courses rely on literary study, workshops, and individual conferences to help student poets, novelists, essayists and playwrights understand the creative process and create afresh imagined worlds. Courses in the Writing Competency Program employ several rhetorical and pedagogical strategies to ensure that students graduate knowing how to write well. The Writing Center works in concert with writing and literature courses and across the disciplines, helping students from all majors achieve skill, precision, and grace in their writing. Our mission includes maintaining and staffing the following programs: Program I Literature Courses for Majors: a wide range of courses, including period surveys, major author courses, and topic-oriented courses. Program II Creative Writing : basic, intermediate, and advanced courses in the writing of fiction and poetry, which meet the Experiential Learning requirements of the general education curriculum. These are the core courses of the Creative Writing Major, even as they support the English major with an emphasis in writing. They also prepare students for M.F.A. programs in creative writing. English majors are strongly advised to attain an intermediate-level competence in a foreign language, especially if they plan to do graduate work in English. Other recommended courses include Introduction to the Bible; courses in art history, music, history, and philosophy; and literature courses in the Department of Modern Languages. In the spring of junior year, each English major meets with his or her advisor and another department faculty member of the student's choosing to complete the Junior Review, a formal review of the student's course selections, plans for a senior project, and post- graduation aspirations. The Junior Review helps to ensure that majors will complete all College and department requirements by his or her declared ACD (\"Anticipated Completion Date\") and will have taken a variety of period and genre courses, as well as the \"Approaches\" course in critical methodologies prerequisite to writing a Senior Project. These approaches or methodologies will combine close reading, textual analysis, scholarly research, and literary criticism and theory. The minimal paper requirement for Approaches courses is a properly documented ten-page essay making use of primary and secondary texts and employing one or more approaches or methods. Enrollment is limited to 15. Majors with a Concentration in Creative Writing will declare that concentration at the Junior Review. English majors must complete a senior project, typically during January Term of their senior year. The project consists either of a long paper exploring a particular author or subject in depth or an original manuscript of creative writing, and an oral review by the student's study advisor and another department member selected by the student. English majors who plan to earn a teaching certification in secondary English are required to have earned a 3.0 average in their major by the start of the semester before they student teach, with allowance for exceptions in extraordinary circumstances. Such students should obtain a copy of the department's \"Policy on Student Teachers\" from the Department Chair or Chair of the English Education Committee no later than their sophomore year. Students must meet the requirements outlined in this policy statement to qualify for student teaching. 100 The department offers various other opportunities for special study outside the classroom. Students meet and interact with prominent writers through the Visiting Writers Series and up-and-coming writers through the New American Writing Festival. Nobel laureates Joseph Brodsky and Derek Walcott, Pulitzer prize winners Donald Justice, Marilynne Robinson, and N. Scott Momaday, Poet Laureates Robert Pinsky and Billy Collins, and such well-known authors as Jamaica Kincaid and Joyce Carol Oates have given readings and led student workshops. English majors also write for and edit Word of Mouth, the College literary magazine, and Hilltops, the student newspaper. Recommended students work as tutors at the Writing Center, gaining valuable experience and academic credit, as well. The department encourages its majors to do internships in fields such as journalism, marketing, public relations, law and publishing. Hartwick English majors graduate with verbal and analytical skills that serve them well in a wide variety of occupations, including law and medicine, libraries and museums, corporate and government agencies, and publications and communications.

The barbarian pagan invaders from the Scandinavian peninsula astonished and terrified the medieval Christian societies of the late 8th and 9th centuries, raiding and settling throughout Western Europe and beyond, from Nova Scotia to Byzantium. After their conversion to Christianity in the 10th and 11th centuries, however, the erstwhile Vikings performed a second astonishing feat: they created a body of vernacular literature that is virtually unparalleled in its imagination, breadth, and beauty. This course examines a small piece of this rich heritage through readings (in translation, of course) of examples of the major genres of Old Norse-Icelandic literature: eddic poetry, skaldic poetry, and saga. Recurrent themes and emphases will include the importance of revenge, the law, the varying roles of women, and the evolving influence of Christian ideolog y. 241 American Literature: Civil War to the Present (3 credits) A study of selected works of leading American authors since the Civil War, such as Dickinson, Twain, Gilman, Wharton, Cather, Frost, Hemingway, Faulkner, Hurston, and Wright.

G. Wells. 262 Utopia and Dystopia in Literature (3 credits) This course offers an interdisciplinary engagement with various elements of the Utopian tradition, including its pessimistic alter ego, the dystopia. From the fundamental question of whether it is possible to imagine social forms radically different from our 102 own, we will trace a series of ever widening circles through matters of human nature, money, technology, desire, authority, fear, and much else besides. Authors may include Thomas More, William Morris, Karl Marx, Yevgeny Zamyatin, George Orwell, Ursula LeGuin, Kim Stanley Robinson, Joanna Russ, and Margaret Atwood. 263 Four Fantasists (3 credits) An exploration of the literary fantasy focusing on works by four of the central figures in the history of the genre: William Morris, H. G. Wells, E. R. Eddison, and J. R. R. Tolkien.

As a genre that leads its readers through more infernal \"caverns measureless to man,\" \"Gothic\" literature is an expression of the Romantic impulse, with authors such as Ann Radcliffe, Horace Walpole, William Beckford, Matthew Lewis and Mary Shelley also figuring in any serious study of this literary movement, which in the decades spanning the publication of Blake's Songs of Innocence in 1789 and the death of Byron in 1824 burned with a hard, gemlike flame that would eventually flare up again in the D\u00e9cadent and Aesthetic Movements that flourished in fin de si\u00e8cle Western Europe. 360 Victorian Literature (3 credits) Typically, the term \"British Victorian\" has been defined in relation to the monarch, Queen Victoria, who reigned over the British Isles from 1837 to 1901. As a descriptor of the work produced over the course of that sixty-year period, however, \"Victorian\" insufficiently denominates the diversity, breadth, and complexity of a literature whose defining themes were shaped by revolutionary developments in technology, in science, in economics, and in the tense social relations between the classes and the sexes. Victorian literature is also Janus-faced, retaining salient ties to the revolutionary literary movement\u2014 \"Romanticism\"\u2014 that preceded it even as it is at times indistinguishable in form and content from the Modernist movement it heralds. Literary lions of the period include\u2014 among novelists\u2014 Charles Dickens, George Eliot, Anthony Trollope, Lewis Carroll, Arthur Conan Doyle, the Bront\u00ebs, Thomas Hardy, and H. G. Wells; among poets, Alfred Tennyson, Robert Browning, Gerard Manley Hopkins; among essayists, Thomas Carlyle and Matthew Arnold; with Aesthetes (Oscar Wilde and W. B. and Christina Rossetti), and Decadents (Algernon Swinburne) rounding off the literary company. 365 Modern British Literature (3 credits) Major trends and writers of British poetry and prose from 1914-60, including Forster, Joyce, Lawrence, Thomas, Woolf, and Yeats. 367 British Authors (3 credits) Courses under this heading focus on the works of one to three British authors read closely within the context of their lives, culture, and critical reception.

May be repeated with different course content. 370 American Literature: Beginnings through Civil War (3 credits) Traces the development of American literature from its roots in the 17th century to the 19th century flowering of the \"American Renaissance,\" with a primary emphasis on major works by authors such as Bradstreet, Poe, Emerson, Thoreau, Hawthorne, Melville, Whitman, Douglass, and Dickinson. Emphasis throughout is on the development of a distinctively American voice, sense of identity, and awareness of social complexity. Designed for English majors. Offered yearly. Prerequisite: ENGL 190 with a grade of C or above. 372 The American Romantics (3 credits) Concentrated study of such major 19th century American writers as Hawthorne, Poe, Emerson, Thoreau, Melville, Whitman.

Readings will include such early writers as Eastman, Winnemucca, McNickle and E. Pauline Johnson to help us understand the growth of literature as an Indian expressive art. Works by such writers of the American Indian Renaissance (1969 to the present) as Momaday, Silko, Erdrich, Harjo, Revard, Welch, and Alexie address contemporary problems in reservation and urban life, and the place of traditional cultures in sustaining Indian community and identity. 380 Major American Authors (3 credits) Courses under this heading seek to enhance our understanding of the life and works of one or more important American authors such as Hawthorne, Melville, Whitman, Dickinson, Faulkner, Frost, Stevens, Bishop, Lowell, Oates, and Morrison. In general, the emphasis is on the close reading of a body of work within a framework of cultural contexts, theoretical constructs, and critical traditions. 382 Issues in American Literature and Culture (3 credits) Advanced study of selected issues in American literature and culture, exploring the incisive, imaginative responses of American writers to their times, and examining the way literature is shaped by, and helps us to shape, cultural contexts. May be repeated with different course content. 384 Studies in American Poetry (3 credits) Advanced study of an aspect of American poetry.

Environment, Sustainability and Society major provides an interdisciplinary framework for studying some of the most compelling struggles of our time. Such a major would take advantage of Hartwick's pre-existing liberal arts structure, while allowing for the study of the real-world issues shaping modern sustainable practices. This new major is well positioned to meld the liberal arts and experiential learning to educate students to become conscientious citizens in a new era of sustainable awareness. With an Environment, Sustainability and Society major, Hartwick will be working to fulfill its promise as \"a future-directed college, focusing on educating people in ways that will make them effective and contributing citizens to the world of their future.\" By completing a degree in Environment, Sustainability and Society, students will gain a competitive foothold in an expanding job market in \"green careers.\" Our graduates would benefit from our strong liberal arts education and a degree in Environment, Sustainability and Society would allow them to gain a competitive foothold within an exciting and expanding job market. In recent years the need for employees with degrees in environmental areas and sustainability has been increasing. As we become increasingly aware of the complex web of interconnections between humans and our natural environment, it is clear that our modern way of life, which requires that we deplete natural resources at a rate faster than they can be replenished, is not sustainable. Rather than continuing in our current direction, a fundamental shift in our thinking is required. In short, we need to learn to live better in our world. Teaching Faculty and Steering Committee Zsuzsanna Balogh-Brunstad, Chemistry/Geology; Antrosio, Karl Seeley, Jeremy Wisnewski, Edie Quinn, Reid Golden, Richard Lisle Dalton, Kath Kreisher, Mark Kuhlmann, Catherine Minogue, Eric Johnson, David Griffing, Kevin Schultz Environment, Sustainability, and Society Courses ENSS 140 Environmental Ethics (3 credits) This course will examine the philosophical significance of ecology for developing an environmental ethic. Students will examine the root causes of a variety of environmental and social issues including natural resource use, climate change, third world development, environmental justice, population growth, globalization, energy use, and consumerism. After analyzing current issues, student will begin to consider potential responses to these issues while applying environmental ethics as framework for decision-making and sustainable behavior. Throughout the courses students will develop the skills and capacity to examine ethical reasoning and make ethical arguments as they reflect on environmental, social and sustainable issues and ultimately develop their own environmental ethic. ENSS 160 Introduction to Environmental Studies (3 credits) This course investigates major contributions of the social and natural sciences to our understanding of how and why environmental problems happen. Environmentally harmful human behavior is not simply a fact of life, but a product of social conditions that can be studied, understood, and changed. In this course, we examine approaches to resolving environmental problems, including strategies such as market- based policies, reforms of property systems, and social movements that promote environmental justice and sustainable development. Students apply these conceptual approaches to root causes, consequences, and solutions to specific environmental topics. ENSS 320 Geographic Information Systems (3 credits) In this course students become familiar with Geographic Information Systems and data structures and applications in decision making and problem solving. Students will receive and introduction to ESRl's ArcGIS software including data structures, dereferencing, data classification, cartography and spatial data analysis as well as applications of GIS to critical, informed decision making. Students will explore and evaluate a variety of data sources, and introduce them to as well as open source software options. Through interaction with geospatial data and map creation, students can begin to think critically about how to turn raw spatial data into useful 109 information. Students will complete a mapping project of their choice and will find and integrate data from multiple sources and databases of geographic concepts. ENSS 410 Environment, Sustainability and Society Internship or Independent Study (3 credits) Through this course, students will either intern with an environmental, sustainable or community improvement organization or conduct an independent project exploring issues and sustainable solutions. The emphasis in this course is hands-on application and exploration of issues related to sustainability. ENSS 420 Environment, Sustainability and Society Research Project (3 credits) In this senior capstone for the Environment, Sustainability and Society Major, students will research issues related to the environment and sustainability and applications within society or natural and built environments and write a formal paper exploring the issue or detailing the project.

The word environment in its broadest sense means an individual's or community's surroundings. Environmental Chemistry is thus the study of the composition and changes in composition of our surroundings. Environmental Chemistry applies chemistry to a wide variety o f situations including, but not limited to, the broad categories of natural water, air, and soil chemistry; water, air, and soil pollution; pollution remediation; water, waste water, air, and hazardous waste treatment; pollution prevention (also known as green chemistry); toxicology; and resource availability and use. Some specific issues you may be familiar with that fall under these broad categories include ozone depletion, global warming, indoor air pollution, availability and use of fossil fuels, alternative energy sources, acid rain, and many others. Requirements for a major in Environmental Chemistry include courses in Biology and/or Geology as well as in chemistry and auxiliary courses in math and physics. A required senior research project involves laboratory, library, and possibly field work, interpretation of data, and oral and written reports of the results. In addition to the independent research required for their Senior Project, Environmental Chemistry majors often collaborate with faculty on ongoing research and/or complete internships with state and federal agencies, environmental consulting firms, or other universities. Hartwick's major in Environmental Chemistry prepares students for entry-level positions in consulting firms, industry, state and federal government agencies, and research laboratories or for entry into graduate school to pursue a master's or doctoral degree.

Our program of study in Environmental Science and Policy (ES&P) focuses on educating broadly trained professionals who can apply critical, creative, and interdisciplinary thinking to understanding and generating sustainable solutions to local and global problems. ES&P professionals must approach problems from many perspectives, and thus require an educational background that is firmly rooted in Physical and Life Sciences, Economics, Political Science, Social Sciences, and the Arts and Humanities. Our program is designed to provide students with the theoretical and experiential foundation that prepares them for either graduate school or employment in environmental occupations in both public and private sectors. The program of study begins with an introductory course, followed by a selection of courses chosen from a wide variety of disciplines including Anthropology, Biology, Chemistry, Economics, Geology, History, Physics, Political Science, and Philosophy. Opportunities for students in the program include internships, off-campus courses, directed and independent studies, conferences, and summer research. Off-campus courses, in particular, offer unique and valuable opportunities for students interested in environmental issues, and include studies in Arizona, Bahamas, Costa Rica, Hawaii, and Madagascar. In addition to the curriculum, our location on the western edge of the Catskill Mountains near the headwaters of the Susquehanna River is favorable for field-based study of many ecosystems. Students in the program benefit from the Robert R. Smith Environmental Field Station on Hartwick's Pine Lake Environmental Campus, which has access to over 2,000 acres of mixed deciduous forests, lakes, swamps, and streams and is only eight miles from the main campus.

Hartwick's French program, offered through the Department of Modern Languages, introduces students to the rich Francophone world through courses in language, literature and culture. More than 220 million people speak French in the world: it is the second most widely learned foreign language after English, and it is used widely in commerce, the arts, and international affairs. Whether students pursue courses in French as part of their liberal arts education or complete a major or a minor program in the language, they gain a breadth of perspective and useful skills that will prove valuable in the coming years. The French major at Hartwick is designed to develop fluency in both oral and written language communication as well as broaden each student's global perspective through a critical understanding of multiculturalism in Francophone countries. In addition to the variety of language, culture, and literature courses offered on the Hartwick campus, the program offers the benefits of practical experience through internships and partnerships with global organizations. A traditional minor in French is a valuable complement to any major and an important skill in many careers and fields. A student interested in completing a minor in French is encouraged to consult with faculty in order to pursue a program that best suits their interests and career goals. Students majoring and minoring in French are encouraged to broaden their understanding in the field by taking related courses in other disciplines. Students who have never studied French should register for FREN 101 Beginning French; FREN 101, FREN 102, FREN 201 and FREN 202 constitute the introductory sequence. After consulting with the French staff, students may enroll in any French course for which they are qualified. Students who wish to pursue an in-depth study in French may major solely in French or combine it with a second major in another discipline. French majors may also earn teacher certification in the language. Requirements for the major as well as the minor in French are designed to assure that students receive a balanced program of courses in language, culture and civilization, and literature. Course choices within these areas, and the need to select additional courses to complete their programs, offer students the flexibility to tailor their studies to their interests and career plans. Because study abroad enhances and reinforces classroom learning, allowing students to use their language skills and experience the culture firsthand, the French faculty strongly recommends that all students majoring or minoring in the language participate in at least one study-abroad program. The department conducts a January Term program in France at least every other year; students also may enroll in affiliated study-abroad programs administered by other organizations. Language graduates are prepared for a range of career opportunities in a variety of fields, as well as for graduate and professional study. Recent Hartwick graduates with a major in French are employed in careers in banking, teaching, international relations, import- export business, government, travel, and translation. An agreement with the University of Nice-Sophia Antipolis has in recent years allowed one graduating French major per year to spend a year in Nice as a paid lecturer in English.

Along with its own unique concepts, geology incorporates and integrates aspects of the physical, chemical and biological sciences. It is also concerned with the Earth's history and the processes operating in and on the Earth, including the formation of its surface features, and the erosion and deformation of this surface. The more that is known about the Earth's materials, formation and structure the better we can appreciate, use and preserve our planet. This understanding is at the heart of many economic, social and environmental issues such as oil and mineral exploration, safe disposal of industrial and municipal wastes, preservation of groundwater supplies, and the choice of sites for dams, nuclear power plants and high-rise buildings. These issues will become more complex as demands on Earth and its resources increase. In addition, study in the discipline can help students develop reasoning and analytical skills that can prove useful throughout their lives. Geology is an inductive science that requires creativity\u2014geologists develop hypotheses, sort through the available data, and determine the most logical hypothesis supported by that data. As they look at the evolution of Earth (its life and its environments, the formation of microscopic crystals, the global movement of continents) over millions of years\u2014they are constantly asking: What were the conditions when this occurred? Why did it happen? How? The study of geology as part of a broader liberal arts and sciences education prepares students to become better-informed citizens, able to make reasoned judgments that will guide the regulation, protection and development of our environment in the coming century. In addition, a minor in Geology can complement major study in a variety of other disciplines, from Chemistry to Political Scienc e. Courses required for a major in Geology are selected to give students a broad background in the field. Introductory courses cover the origin, composition, structure and history of the Earth. In subsequent courses, students study: 1) minerals, 2) igneous and metamorphic rocks, 3) fossils and sedimentary rocks, 3) the deformation of rocks, 4) the flow dynamics and chemistry of surface- and ground- waters, 5) the physical and chemical effects of pollution, and 6) the way in which data are gathered and recorded in the field. An understanding of basic concepts necessary for work in geology is gained through required courses in chemistry, physics, and calculus. By the spring semester of their junior year, majors develop study proposals for the required Senior Thesis (GEOL 490) project, as part of the required P re-Thesis Research course (GEOL 489). The project typically includes both laboratory and fieldwork, and this fieldwork may require time in the summer. Majors are encouraged to go beyond the minimal requirements, taking additional courses in chemistry, computer science and mathematics. Since geology is a field-based science and exposure to diverse field phenomena provides a stronger understanding of these phenomena, students are also encouraged to build their field knowledge in courses with extended off-campus field components (GEOL 227 and 275). Students interested in teaching high school earth science can obtain certification by fulfilling requirements for the Geological Education Track combined with a program of courses from the Education Department. Careers are available in several areas for students with undergraduate degrees in geology. Graduates of the program are typically employed at the entry level of the energy, mineral, and environmental science industries, as well as some government agencies . However, supervisory- and research-level employment is typically available to individuals with a graduate degree. Consequently, some geology majors at Hartwick go on to attend graduate school in the geosciences.

Simple conversational patterns are practiced, and aspects of German life and society are treated. No prerequisite. (LN1) 102 Beginning German II (3 credits) This is a continuation of the first semester of basic German. The remainder of the basic grammatical concepts are treated. Readings of increasing difficulty are undertaken and vocabulary building is stressed. More complex conversational patterns are practiced, as well as having further discussions of German life and society. Prerequisite: GERM 101 or its equivalent. (LN2) 125 Global Studies The Global Studies major and minor will enable students to thrive in a world of global interdependence by developing the skills necessary for pursuing international opportunities and finding solutions to global challenges. Students will communicate effectively in at least one language other than English, know how to navigate cultural diversity, recognize the interconnections between local and global issues, travel abroad to experience what they are learning, and make their own unique contributions to increased global understanding. Students who have never studied a second language should register for a first-semester beginning course in any language offered by the College: students must complete a fourth-semester course (FREN/SPAN/GERM 202) to satisfy the language requirement for Global Studies. Students may fulfill the language requirement through study abroad with an approved affiliated program. There are four interdisciplinary concentrations in Global Studies at Hartwick: Latin American and Caribbean Studies, European Studies, Comparative Culture Studies, and Global Trade, Development and Economic Policy. Each concentration requires a specific distribution of course credits in the Arts and Humanities and in the Social Sciences, but these distributions are designed to be flexible and accommodate students' interests. Students should fulfill the distribution requirements in order to prepare themselves for a successful off-campus program, service learning project, or internship that emphasizes practical global experience. Faculty will work closely with students to design a course of study that prepares them well for applying what they learn in the classroom to a constantly changing world. Global Studies majors and minors will be prepared for interdisciplinary graduate study both here and abroad and for employment in international business, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and the foreign service.

Societies, institutions, technologies, and ideas have changed over time, and to analyze those changes and understand the relationship between past and present, historians need well-developed interpretive and expressive skills. We teach students to \"do\" history by helping them learn how to analyze written and material evidence, and then use that evidence to test generalizations about the past -- including their own. We strive to ignite in all history majors the joys of historical discovery that starts with meaningful questions about the past. As students' progress through the major, they learn about the history of different eras and world regions, and develop a greater depth of knowledge about a particular topic and region of interest to them. Students build their understanding from two required, thematic introductory surveys in American and in Global histories. They acquire depth of knowledge as they complete two required Concentrations in any of the following four areas of history: American, Latin American, European, or Global. And they refine their knowledge and skills as practicing historians through a required course in historical methods (HIST 322) and through the department's distinctive 300-level seminars. These seminars immerse students in current, thematic and theoretical approaches to historical issues such as why slavery developed in some parts of Latin America and the Caribbean but not in others; how the idea of the \"Renaissance\" has framed Western perceptions of modernity; why diseases like cholera challenged dominant political and economic ideas in industrial Europe; or how perceptions formed during the Cold War still influence current U.S. foreign relations. Typically, small classes of 8-15 students, the seminars foster a stimulating intellectual environment in which students and faculty collaborate closely as colleagues and build a mentoring relationship that culminates in the senior research project. This substantial achievement is celebrated each Fall and Spring, when Capstone and Thesis students present their research in a public defense. For History majors the challenge of this research project is one of the most memorable and satisfying aspects of their Hartwick education. History courses at Hartwick emphasize active student learning through discussion, group work, peer critiques, individual presentations, and analysis of documents or material remains of past cultures. This active learning extends to self-discovery, as students are encouraged to reflect on their own political commitments and intellectual passions that drive their engagements with the past. History courses, and the history faculty, are deeply integrated with many of Hartwick's interdisciplinary minors, such as Environmental Science and Policy, Women's and Gender Studies, Museum Studies, Peace and Conflict, and Race and Ethnic Studies, and provide students with rich opportunities to explore their interests across disciplines. Our goals for all students in history courses are that they develop the skills that help them achieve meaningful answers to their questions. They learn how to construct a clear, historical argument or thesis statement that is capable of being tested with primary source evidence, and how to analyze that primary source evidence with reference to its appropriate historical context. They analyze differing secondary historical accounts of the past and evaluate what may have influenced historians to interpret the same events differently. And because history is a communal activity that connects the individual to many broader communities, our major prepares students to communicate their ideas effectively in written and spoken forms. Experiential Learning Opportunities : Students further enrich their academic programs through a variety of learning opportunities offered by the department beyond the classroom. Students can design independent reading and research projects with faculty approval that allow them to delve more deeply into an area of particular interest. The department has offered off-campus January Term programs in France, England, and the Czech Republic. Some majors have pursued semester-long programs at universities in France, Wales, Mexico, Ireland, and Spain. Others have taken advantage of Hartwick's Duffy Scholarships to realize their own, independent research projects in Colombia, Cuba, New Zealand, Italy, and England. Majors also undertake internships in areas that relate to their academic field and future career goals. For example, during January Term, history majors have served as teaching aides, clerks at law firms, or as members of museum staffs. Semester-long programs in Washington, DC, Boston, Philadelphia, or New York also mix classroom experience in urban universities with internships in Congress or other institutions in the public and private spheres. Career preparation : In all, the diverse coursework and other opportunities offered by the history department are designed to meet the needs and intellectual interests of a variety of students, including those who want to become professional historians. The analytical, research, and writing skills acquired through the history major are also excellent preparation for careers in law, administration, marketing and communications, secondary education, government, libraries, records management, museums, and many more fields.

Topics include: the politics of empire and independence; the emergence of an American political culture; the Confederation era and the drafting of the U.S. Constitution; the origins and workings of the party systems; the changing concept of citizenship especially in regard to race, class, and gender; and the liberal state. 104 Race and Ethnicity in American History (3 credits) This course is a survey of the dynamic of race and ethnicity from the colonial era to the present day. Topics include: Native Americans and the project of colonization; the rise of slavery and the birth of African American culture; race and republican citizenship; the politics of \"whiteness,\" labor and immigration; the operation of a black/white racial binary in a multiethnic society; the rise of scientific racism; and strategies of opposition and resistance. For their course projects (papers/presentations), students conduct research on their family's and their community's ethnic history. (EL) 240 American Environmental Relations (3 credits) This broad overview covers our country's environmental history from pre-conquest to current, sampling history from each region, and from a diversity of views. Throughout the course, we strive to understand our individual and our nation's relationship to the environment/nature. We not only examine changing historical interpretations and relationships, but race, ethnicity, class, and gender as well, as they influenced and were influenced by environmental forces. While our focus is the historical record and its analysis, we do not ignore nature writing and art/photography, past and present. Because environmental history is as current as today's newspaper headlines, we consider current environmental issues. Throughout our readings, we will analyze the historical connection between the degradation of people, e.g., communities of color, and degradation of the environment, that is the link between racism/poverty and pollution. To insure that we each understand that we are part of our country's, our community's, our family's, and our own environmental history, we have two research projects/papers : \"Family Environmental History\" and \"Community Environmental History.\" (EL) 241 Environmental Injustice (3 credits) This course analyzes the historical connection between the degradation of people, e.g., communities of color, and degradation of the environment, that is the link between racism/poverty and pollution. We begin with an analysis of the conditions of enslaved Blacks and the soil in the tobacco and cotton South. In the modern period, we analyze environmental and social issues in migrant agricultural labor, as well as environmental degradation in communities of color and/or poverty. We utilize the analytical lenses of race, ethnicity, regionalism, gender and class. However, in our analysis we are very careful NOT to portray the community members or agricultural workers as simply \"victims.\" Thus, we also focus on their diverse responses, e.g., protesting and organizing, for example, forming the United Farm Workers (UFW). Also, subtler forms of environmental injustice will be discussed, e.g., the economically privileged nature of many environmental \"solutions\" and campaigns. For our research project (paper/presentation), students conduct research on evidence of environmental injustices and organized responses in their home community/area. (EL) 242 Women in American History (3 credits) This course is a survey of the history of women in America from the colonial period to the modern era. With specific attention to the intersecting analytical categories of gender, race, class, and ethnicity, we will spend time analyzing women's political, economic, and social role in a developing nation. Topics to be covered include: war, citizenship, slavery, suffrage, labor, industrialization, immigration, gender spheres, consumerism, civil rights, marriage, and family. 246 Popular Culture and the Media: Historical Perspectives (3 credits) (J Term) This course surveys the history of American popular culture from the late nineteenth century through the 1970s. Adopting an historical perspective, we will focus on fiction, film, television, and radio, with some discussion of vaudeville, popular dance, sports, popular architecture, material culture, and music. The course analyzes the concept of \"low\" and \"high\" culture and attempts to understand why different popular cultural forms resonated in the past. The course also focuses on the intersecting analytical categories of race, class, ethnicity, and gender in the media. Perspectives in Global History : These foundational courses examine the eras in global history from the perspective of a particular critical lens. One Global Perspectives course is required for the major and the minor. 162 Health and Disease in Modern Global History (3 credits) A survey of major developments in world history with an emphasis on how these developments shaped and were shaped by disease and human efforts to control it. Major themes will include the biological consequences of exploration and increased encounters between the world's populations; comparative systems of explaining disease and humanity's 131 relationship to the natural world (science, philosophy, religion); the legacy of industrialization for environmental and individual health; and the role of imperialism in creating global power imbalances and disparities in access to health and well-being. 165 Free and Unfree Labor (3 credits) This course is a survey of world labor history, focusing on the period 1500-present. The first unit examines the various forms of unfree labor, including serfdom, slavery, servitude, and peonage. The second unit surveys the ways in which laboring people resisted and sought to shape their own worlds. The final unit examines labor during and after the Age of Revolution, focusing on the rise of wage labor and its attendant problems, as well as workers' movements. Special attention will be paid to the connections between class, race, and gender. 261 Indian Ocean World, 1300-1800 (3 credits) An introduction to the history of the peoples and societies of India, Arabia, and East Africa, with an emphasis on the role of trade, religion, and cultural exchange in shaping the civilizations of the Delhi Sultanate, the Mughal Empire, cities of the East African Swahili Coast and the Ottoman Empire. The course will examine the thriving indigenous shipping and other exchange networks before the arrival of Europeans in 1498, with a primary focus on the Indian Ocean as a hub of human exchanges between India, Arabia, and Africa in the era of the classical Islamic world. 262 Politics of Identity: Globalization, Diaspora, and Diversity (3 credits) In our \"global\" age identity continues to be an extremely fascinating as well as complicated phenomenon. By utilizing journalistic accounts on contemporary issues, narratives, theoretical readings, feature movies, and documentary films, this course seeks to understand who and what we are, both at individual and collective levels, with special emphasis on globalization, diaspora, and diversity. General Survey Courses 201 Colonial Latin America (3 credits) This course is intended to survey the history of Latin America from the Iberian conquest in the early 16th century to the emergence of new states during the nineteenth century. We will discuss historical processes by which both the powerful and the powerless actively participated in making Latin America as a part of the New World. We will also examine how race, ethnicity, gender, and class were interwoven into colonial Latin American history. 202 Modern Latin America (3 credits) This course is structured around the imposing and extraordinary changes that have taken place in Latin America and the Caribbean from independence until the present day. We will increase our knowledge and understanding of Latin America and the Caribbean. Furthermore, the course will place the region within the economic, political, social, and cultural complex of the entire hemisphere. 208 History of Republican and Imperial Rome (3 credits) This course offers an introduction to the history and culture of the ancient Romans from their origins up to the death of Constantine. The class explores the life, beliefs, and institutions of these people through an examination of their cultural and political achievements. 209 Medieval Europe (3 credits) This course traces the emergence of Europe through the synthesis of Greek, Christian, Roman and Germanic cultures. The survey will begin with the collapse of the Pax Romana in the third century and conclude with the crisis of the 14th century and its immediate aftermath. The survey will focus on Western Europe, but the class will discuss Byzantium and Islam as unique civilizations, which profoundly influenced European culture. 210 Early Modern Europe (3 credits) This course first examines the birth of modern Europe in the Italian Renaissance. It then considers the religious and political forces, which shredded the fabric of Christian unity and ushered in an age of religious and dynastic warfare that produced the modern constitutional and absolutist states. The survey will then examine the cultural, economic and political impact of overseas exploration, the Scientific Revolution and the Enlightenment. The survey culminates with a close examination of the French and Industrial Revolutions. 212 Revolutionary Europe (3 credits) How did Europe make the transition from a collection of hereditary monarchies ruling over predominantly rural societies to a group of nation- states whose systems of representative government were increasingly controlled by urban middle classes? This course will focus on key political, economic, and social revolutions in nineteenth-century Europe, from the French Revolution of 1789 and its introduction of popular sovereignty to European political institutions, through the economic and social transformations of industrialization, to the emergence of nationalism and the modern nation-state. We will consider how contemporaries grappled with the meaning of \"liberty\" and \"equality,\" and whether all people were included in these radical new concepts. Attention will also be devoted to the prevailing cultural assumptions about race, class, and gender that defined Europeans' sense of identity and that imperial powers like Great Britain and France used to justify their conquest of peoples in Africa and Asia. 213 Major Power Europe (3 credits) This course will trace European society from the peak of its global dominance, when aristocrats waltzed and military parades cultivated a sense of national greatness, to its implosion in war, political extremism, and genocide. It begins in 1870, with emergence of the German Empire and growing tensions between the major European powers (Britain, France, Russia, Germany, and Austria-Hungary) over their regional and global influence. We will examine how national identity was cultivated through public schools, state-directed campaigns at suppressing ethnic or religious minorities, and even through newspapers, clubs, sports, and holidays. We will consider the paradox in the 132 claim of European imperialists that European civilization was the peak of all human achievement even as European imperial rule in Africa and Asia contributed to famine and disease and factored into Europe's rush to war in 1914. We will explore the First World War in depth for its pivotal changes in international relations, in industrial production, and in the scale of modern warfare, and conclude with the cultural anxiety and political extremism of the 1920s and 1930s that would culminate in fascism, Nazism, and a Second World War that left much of Europe shattered in 1945. 214 Contemporary Europe (3 credits) The Second World War was catastrophic for Europe and produced a level of destruction unparalleled in European history. This has led some historians to describe 1945 as \"Year Zero\" for a new Europe that had to rebuild not just cities but governments, economies, and cultural mindsets. This course will explore Europe as it emerged from the ruins of 1945 and adapted to new global realities, from the political polarization of the Cold War to the end of Europe's colonial empires in Asia and Africa. We will also consider the challenges of European integration, from the creation of the European Union and the Eurozone to contemporary questions about Islam in Europe. 215 Tudor-Stuart History (3 credits) A survey of Tudor-Stuart English history (ca. 1485-1688), one of the most important periods of Western European history as it shaped much of English society into the present even as it served as a baseline for much of what would be reinforced, continued, or altered as the English confronted the complexities of the \"New World.\" 216 Witchcraft and Witch-Hunting (3 credits) Between 1450 and 1750, European authorities engaged in witch- hunting in Europe and later in their overseas colonies. This class will explore the educated theories and popular beliefs regarding witchcraft, examine individual cases, and explore the actual and imagined practices identified as diabolical witchcraft by the hunters. We will read extensively in the new, contentious, and rich literature on witchcraft and witch-hunting. We also will work with descriptive and prescriptive primary sources. Student work will include review essays of the extant literature, an individual research project, a mid-term, and a final exam. 219 Imagined Communities in France (4 credits) An interactive, cross-cultural study of the historical construction of the French sense of identity and the different forms of \"community\" (national, historical, cultural, and religious) in which the identity of being \"French\" is either invented or challenged. France will serve as a test case for some of the broader issues in the formation of community throughout Europe. Although the program will be based in the Loire valley city of Tours, students will visit Paris, the chateaux of the Loire Valley, and other historic and cultural centers. Offered off-campus, in France, in January Term. (EL) 225 History of Brazil (3 credits) Through lecturers, readings, and discussions, together with movies and videos, this course is intended to examine changes and continuities in Brazilian history from \"discovery\" to the present. Special emphasis will be placed on race, class, gender, and ethnicity. We will discuss how colonial heritages determined the \"fate\" of modern Brazil; and how various forms of power relationship emerged, evolved, disappeared, and/or transformed in Brazilian history. 245 World War II on the Home Front (3 credits) When students enroll in this course, they enlist \"for the duration,\" in order to \"reconstruct\" the Home Front from Pearl Harbor to \"V-J\" Day. This course is normally taught in January Term, giving students the opportunity to solely and totally concentrate their attention on this goal, making it easier to reconstruct the home front. Daily exercises in recreating the home front include music of the period, letters, diary entries, columns by war correspondent Ernie Pyle, excerpts from oral histories, and incorporation of WWII home front artifacts. Besides this \"hands-on\" approach to history, students critically analyze WWII as \"The Good War\" and the debate over WWII as a \"watershed\" in the 20th century, addressing the question, was WWII's impact on society an \"example of continuity or change?\" For their course projects (papers/presentations), students conduct research on their family's and their community's WWII history. (EL) 247 The Sixties (3 credits) While this course includes tie-dye, counterculture studies and 60s era movies, it also involves the same serious, historical analysis as any history course, being equally READING & WRITING intensive. In studying the Sixties, we study the Cold War, the Vietnam War, Civil Rights and Black Power Movements, and the various other Movements that sprouted from the fertile soil of The Sixties, such as the Women's Movement, Red Power, and Environmentalism. Students engage in a research project (paper/presentation) on their family's history during The Sixties. Class participation is always guaranteed in the \"Found Sixties Objects\" days (paper/presentation). (EL) 248 Vietnam War (3 credits) Course examines Vietnam War as a Cold War, with a strong emphasis on U.S. foreign relations over the course of the Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon/Ford administrations. In discussing combat, the emphasis is on the experiences of the \"grunts\" on the battlefield, including Tim O'Brien's book, The Things They Carried. Who fought/who didn't will be considered. The War at Home (i.e., anti-war protests) and the intersection of the Vietnam War and Civil Rights/Black Power Movements will be examined, especially Rev. Martin Luther King's opposition to the war. Students will research their family's history during the Vietnam War Era for a paper and presentation. (EL) 249 Civil Rights Movement (3 credits) After setting the stage in the late 19th and early 20th centuries concerning the social, economic, and political conditions of African Americans in the South and North, we will examine the Civil Right Movement (CRM) in the mid-20th Century. We will also analyze the Black Power Movement, the complex and changing ideology of Malcolm X, and the radicalization of Martin Luther King, Jr. An ongoing topic is the role of the media in the CRM & Black Power. Other issues include the 133 influence of the CRM on U.S. foreign policy during the Cold War, the intersection of the Vietnam War and Black Power and CRM, and the CRM/Black Power on other '60s-'70s movements, e.g., the Chicano Movement. We will consider the arts\u2014music and graphics arts\u2014in the CRM and Black Power. In order to understand larger issues of discrimination and recognize the presence of discrimination around us, each student will conduct a major research project (paper/presentation) on the history of race relations and the current presence of racism and other forms of discrimination in their home communities. This project is designed to open our eyes to the subtle forms of discrimination in the world around us and inspire us to actively oppose discrimination in all its forms. (EL) 250 Topics in History (3 credits) From time to time the department will offer courses in particular topics in history. Students may elect HIST 250 more than once, provided they do not repeat the same topic. 270 Revisiting Roots (3 credits) The primary objective of this course, combining historiography and genealogy, is to expose similarities and differences in the portrayal of the slavery system and its impact upon the family structure of the enslaved Africans and their descendants in Great Britain, the British West Indies, and the United States. This is done by critiquing required readings, analyzing an American television series, class discussions, and research labs, including possible off- campus visits. (EL) 275 American Indian History to 1700 (3 credits) From the peopling of the New World some 20,000 plus years ago to 1700, the rise of civilizations, the differentiation of cultures and the impact of European civilization on Indian America are mapped out and probed. The first third of the course will emphasize Indians' world views and their relationships with each other and their varying environments. The course will then examine the social, religious, technological, ecological, and political changes that impacted Indian societies between 1492 and 1700. 283 History of Medicine and Public Health (3 credits) Medicine and healing have changed much since the time of Black Death, when contemporaries blamed the disease on God's wrath, planetary alignments, and even on Jews. The quest for evidence of how the healthy body functions and what causes disease intensified after the Renaissance and the anatomist Andreas Vesalius's call to \"see for oneself.\" This course will explore the evolution of medicine and healing since the plague pandemic of 1348-52, with particular emphasis on how political and cultural views have shaped who could practice medicine, who had access to care, and how societies responded to the threat of disease. We will also explore how health evolved from a personal matter to a national priority in modern states and the effect this had on the rights of individual citizens. Drawing upon health-themed short stories, plays, films, documentaries, art, written sources, and case studies, participants in the course will engage with past issues in health and medicine that still resonate in healthcare debates today. 322 Historical Methods (4 credits) This course introduces the students to the fundamental skills of historical research. Students work with primary and secondary source materials in the archives, online, and in print. They learn to distinguish primary from secondary sources, to understand the problems that various sources pose to interpretation, and to identify the types of questions particular sources can answer. They learn to read these sources critically and to think historically. Students learn the identifying characteristics of monographs and are introduced to historiography. They learn how to quote properly, to summarize, and to annotate sources. Finally, they apply their skills in both a series of short writing assignments, including review essays, interpretive source critiques, pr\u00e9cis, and a substantial research paper based on primary and secondary sources. From the skills acquired in this course, the student should have the methodological foundation needed to conduct research in any course that involves historical analysis, and to be prepared for senior thesis. (NOT offered in January Term.) Prerequisite: History Major or Minor status. We recommend that this course be taken a student's second year, or in the first semester at Hartwick for transfer students. Seminars and Capstone Seminars: 300-level seminars are open to sophomores, juniors, and seniors, and typically involve extensive reading, discussion and a research paper. Seniors (and, in exceptional cases, juniors) may register for one of the 400- level Capstone Seminars to complete their Capstone research project in that seminar, if they opt to do the Capstone project instead of HIST 490 Senior Thesis. The Capstone project is an article-length (30 pages) research paper based on original analysis of th e primary-source evidence and historical scholarship relevant to the student's chosen topic. Topics for Capstone projects must fall within the scope of the Capstone Seminar. As part of the Capstone project, students are required to present an oral defense of their research before the history faculty and their peers. Pre-requisites for all 400-level Capstone Seminars: Junior-level standing; history major a C or better in HIST 322: Historical Methods; and completion of at least 31 credits in the history major (in addition to any pre- requisites listed for the companion 300-level seminar). Note: Students may not earn credit for both a 300-level seminar and its companion 400-level Capstone Seminar. 305/405 The Renaissance (4 credits) This course will not be a chronological survey; instead it will cover the origins of the idea of the \"Renaissance\" and how this concept has framed Western perceptions of modernity. It will investigate the functional practicality of applying this concept to Italian culture and society between 1350 and 1550. The course has two goals: to provide an understanding of the world of the Italian Renaissance and to critique the values we have associated with that world. Students will be required to complete a major primary sour ce-based research paper on a topic of their choosing. Prerequisites: HIST 209, HIST 210 or instructor's permission. (ILS) 134 306/406 Reformation Europe 1450-1600 (4 credits) This course examines the dissolution of Medieval European culture as a system of regulated religious beliefs and established political relations between the Roman church and secular powers. It also will consider the economic dislocation and social tensions that animated the Reformation passions, and examine the reintegration of these dynamic factors into new systems of belief and power during the age of confessional struggles. Students will be required to complete a major primary source- based research paper on a topic of their choosing. Prerequisites: HIST 209, HIST 210 or instructor's permission. (ILS) 313/413 Europe and the World Wars (4 credits) World War I and World War II have long held a morbid fascination for many who have been both amazed and appalled at the scale of devastation that left millions dead and much of the continent in ruins. However, the impact of these wars extended beyond the battles to transform European views about the government, about women, about technology, and even about the nature of good and evil. This upper-level seminar will engage these issues through a critical examination of the historical debates about totalitarian dictatorships in Europe, the \"failures\" of the Versailles Treaty, anxieties about femininity, masculinity, and identity during the inter-war period, as well as other topics. Although there are no pre- requisites for this seminar, it is strongly recommended that students have some background in 20th century European history. Students will be required to complete a major primary source-based research paper on a topic of their choosing. (ILS) 314/414 Modern European History (4 credits) This course will undertake an in-depth examination of major social, political, intellectual and cultural developments in modern European history, from the Revolution of 1789 and its origins to the present. The themes and content addressed will vary, and may focus on the Cold War in one year, the Industrial Revolution in another year, and Humor & Satire in European Political Culture in still another year. The seminar may also focus in- depth on one specific country (ex. Great Britain) or on a comparison of two countries (ex. Germany and France). Students will be required to complete a major primary source- based paper on a topic of their choosing. This course may be repeated with different content. If a student repeats the course with different content, it bears the number 315. (ILS) 320/420 Travels to the \"Third World\" (4 credits) This seminar focuses on diverse Western writings on the \"third world\" (Latin America, Africa, and Asia) at various historical points for four centuries from the beginning of the sixteenth century to the present. Half of the class meetings treat the following themes: the Old World's encounters with the New World; conversion of the \"pagan\" population; Western tourism to the \"exotic\"; professional baseball players in and from the \"third world,\" and Orientalism. The rest of the course deals with specific authors and their writings on the \"third world.\" Students will be required to complete a major primary source- based research paper on a topic of their choosing. (ILS) 324/424 Slavery in Latin America and the Caribbean (4 credits) This course examines how the institution of slavery was transplanted in Latin America and the Caribbean during the 16th century, why slavery developed in some parts of Latin America and the Caribbean (and why not in other regions), and how the institution was eventually abolished by the last decades of the 19th century. It also examines other important topics, such as the transatlantic slave trade; gender and ethnicity; family and kinship; uprisings and rebellions; and the historical formation of the Black Atlantic. (ILS) 326/426 Gender and Power in Latin America (4 credits) This course discusses various topics concerning gender and power in Latin American history from the late colonial period to the present time. By reading articles and monographs written by historians, life histories, women's narratives, as well as by viewing four Latin American films, we will be able to relate our own experiences to women and men in Latin America. We also will compare and contrast the experiences of different groups of women according to such factors as race, ethnicity, and class. (ILS) 327/427 Revolutions in Latin America and the Caribbean (4 credits) This course will examine historical cases of attempts to change fundamentally the social structure and the social basis of political power in Latin America and the Caribbean. The course attempts to examine the process of social change as well as the broader context in which the changes took place, the cases of Haiti, Mexico, Bolivia, and Cuba. Questions that will be pondered include: How is a revolution defined? What distinguishes revolutions from other forms of change? Are revolutions, however defined, inevitable? Do the Latin American cases represent any peculiarities in the global experiences of revolution? How important was the role of personalities in creating revolutions from revolutionary situations? Who or what determined the ultimate success or failure of the revolution? (ILS) 332/432 Colonial America (4 credits) This course examines North America, with an emphasis on the region that became the United States, from the time of Columbus to 1763. Topics include the historiography of early America; encounters between Europeans and native peoples; European settlement; the development of regional economies and societies; gender and women's lives; the emergence of slavery and the roots of racism; imperial politics; resistance and dissident movements; research methods; and historical writing. Students will be required to complete a major primary source-based research paper on a topic of their choosing. (ILS) 333/433 Revolutionary America (4 credits) This course will examine the American Revolution and the Early Republic, 1763-1815. Topics include the historiography of the American Revolution; the imperial crisis; republicanism(s); the War of the Revolution; the Confederation Era and Constitution; the first party system; slavery and race; women and gender; research methods; and historical writing. Students will be 135 required to complete a major primary source-based research paper on a topic of their choosing. (ILS) 334/434 Jacksonian America (4 credits) This course examines the United States between 1815 and 1848. Topics include the historiography of the period; Native and white America; the construction of \"democracy\" and citizenship; transformations in labor; evangelical religion; the emergence of reform movements; expansionism; women's lives and the woman movement; the growth of plantation agriculture; slave resistance; research methods; and historical writing. Students will be required to complete a major primary source-based research paper on a topic of their choosing. (ILS) 337/437 Civil War and Reconstruction (4 credits) This course examines the United States between 1848 and 1877. Topics include the Civil War historiography; slavery and sectional politics; the major military campaigns; wartime politics; African American resistance and the collapse of slavery; the transformation of household and gender relations; Reconstruction and the realignment of the American political system; and labor in the post- emancipation South. Students will be required to complete a major primary source-based research paper on a topic of their choosing. (IL S) 341/441 American Consumer Culture, 1900-Present (4 credits) This upper-division seminar analyzes American society from the late nineteenth century to the present, focusing on historical consumption styles and practices. The history of consumer culture encompasses not only the study of advertising and shopping but also, in a broader sense, how most Americans have commodified nearly all of their experiences. We will pay special attention to race, class, gender, and ethnicity as we consider the ways that consumer culture has operated in America. Working through the late 19th and the early 20th century, we will explore the different ways that men and women took part in, and helped shape, the mass culture that flourished in an industrializing nation. As we move into the mid-twentieth century, we will look at how a rising standard of living and a national consumer culture defined American identity, with wide-reaching social, environmental, economic, and political implications that in many cases only became clear in later decades. The course will analyze the intellectual movements and ideologies that resisted materialism and mass culture in American culture. It will also study those groups who worked within the system to use their \"buying power\" to effect social change. Students will be required to complete a major primary source-based research paper on a topic of their choosing. (ILS) 344/444 American Business History (4 credits) Starting with the question of whether the nation has always been capitalistic, this course traces the rise of big business in the late nineteenth century through de-industrialization and globalization in the late twentieth century. Course issues or debates may include: public/private, local/national, small/big, regulation/free market, democracy/capitalism, to name just a few. The course evaluates to what degree American culture has given American enterprise its particular national character, and analyzes the ways in which business has shaped American labor systems, its environment, its social relations, and its popular culture. To this end, the course will look at the role of gender, race, class, and ethnicity in business and will examine the often close relation between big business and the state. Students will be required to complete a major primary source- based research paper on a topic of their choosing. (ILS) 345/445 America Between the Wars, 1919-1941 (4 credits) This course examines the era between World War I and World War II, a time of great cultural, political, and economic change. During this period, the rise of the modern state changed the way Americans thought about and related to their government. Ideas about individual rights, social welfare, racial justice, gender equality, and the role of the nation in world affairs changed rapidly. In part because of this transformation, it was a period of tremendous conflict as well between different cultural groups and classes, and between different belief systems. Students will be required to complete a major primary source-based research paper on a topic of their choosing (ILS) 350 Advanced Topics in History (4 credits) From time to time the department will offer advanced courses in particular topics in history. Students are required to complete a major primary source-based research paper. Students may elect HIST 350 more than once, provided they do not repeat the same topic. (ILS) 361/461 European Imperialism (4 credits) Examines the interaction between Europeans, Africans and Asians from 1750 to the present. Issues addressed will include the European use of science and religion to justify their rule over other societies; how the culture of imperialism shaped perceptions of gender and race; how certain Indian and African nationalists argued against imperial rule; and the challenges of the post-colonial era. Because of the scope of the subject, a substantial portion of the course will focus on British and French imperialism in Africa and India from 1850 to 1970. Students will be required to complete a major primary source-based research paper on a topic of their choosing. Prerequisites: HIST 212, HIST 213, HIST 261, or permission of the instructor. (ILS) 362/462 Becoming National (4 credits) Students will survey the development of the nation as a modern cultural identity and the foundation for appropriate political association and representation. The course will consider the pre-modern forms of cultural identity and political organization to emphasize the relatively recent historical appearance of the nation in political discourse. The readings will show the problems with juxtaposing this European model on the colonial and post- colonial worlds. Finally, the students will consider the political alternatives for nations as viable political agents in the 21st century world. Students will be required to complete a major primary source-based research paper on a topic of their choosing. Prerequisite: a global history survey (HIST 160- 169). 136 378/478 American Foreign Relations, 1898 to the Present (4 credits) The goal is to better understand the underlying philosophies, concepts, and tensions present in our foreign relations; the domestic and international context of events and policies, and the continuity and change over more than a century. Students analyze patterns, concepts/theories and the historians' changing interpretations of foreign relations, i.e., historiography. Students learn to employ lenses/perspectives to analyze topics: Liberal Commercial World Order and Mission; National Security, Core Values, and Power; Bureaucracy and Politics; World Systems and Hegemony; Race and Ethnicity; Gendering of Peoples and Nations; and Cultural Interactions and Personality. Students will be required to complete a major primary source-based research paper on a topic of their choosing. (ILS) 383/483 Epidemics in Modern European History (4 credits) Epidemics are more than diseases, they are social phenomena involving populations. As such, they have historical, political, economic, cultural, and religious dimensions. This seminar will delve into the historical context of epidemics in Europe and its colonies in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Industrialization and urbanization increasingly concentrated the population of Europe in cities, raising the specter of water- borne diseases like cholera and communicable respiratory diseases like tuberculosis. At the same time, political democratization within European states and intensified national rivalry between them elevated the health and well- being of their citizens to a national priority. Many European states thus looked to medical science and public health reforms to safeguard their citizens from epidemics and promote political stability and national prowess. Students will be required to complete a major primary source-based research paper on a topic of their choosing. (ILS) 395/495 Internship in History (3-6 credits) Students can apply the theoretical and content knowledge they acquire in their history courses in a professional setting through an internship in history. This is an opportunity to explore potential career paths and creative applications of their individual interests in history. Students should plan the internship with the appropriate faculty supervisor and work closely with the professional staff in the Office of Professional, Service, and Global Engagement (PSGE) to identify a suitable host site. Some examples of past internship sites include: Hartwick's Paul F. Cooper, Jr. Archives and Yager Museum, the Baseball Hall of Fame, the Farmer's Museum, and many other local and regional archives, historical societies, and museums. 490 Senior Thesis (4 credits) For the senior thesis, students draw upon their knowledge of historical subject areas and research methods, as well as their particular interests and general curiosity about the past, to craft their own piece of original research on a topic of historical significance. This capstone research project and essay entails the development of a hypothesis or argument, which is then supported or revised, based on an analysis of the relevant primary source evidence. It is expected that each student will develop the initial idea for his or her senior thesis out of a 300-level history seminar in the same area, and in regular consultation with a thesis advisor. As part of this crowning achievement of the history major, students are required to present an oral defense of their senior thesis before the history faculty and their peers. Prerequisite: Junior-level standing; history major status; a grade of C or better in HIST 322 and completion of at least 31 credits in the history major. Offered in Fall and Spring.

Option B : Complete a one credit exploratory internship consisting of at least five hours of observing court proceedings, interviewing at least two officers of the court about their work, and going on a police ride-along for at least two hours. Evaluation will be based on a final written portfolio reflective of the internship experience. This exploratory internship experience is designed to be completed in the students' home communities during the summer months or January. 139 Mathematics The study of mathematics enables students not only to learn mathematical principles and the application of those principles, but to develop their ability to think logically, solve problems, express themselves precisely and gain a cultural appreciation of the discipline. Mathematics majors must complete a specified core of courses, beginning with a calculus and linear algebra sequence and an introductory course in abstraction. These courses provide the foundation for upper level courses. To obtain an overview of modern mathematics, majors take courses in two general areas, abstract algebra and real analysis, generally during their junior year. As an introduction to applied mathematics, they must elect one of several courses that stress a modeling/problem-solving approach to using mathematics. During the junior year, majors must participate in a Junior Seminar, which emphasizes supervised seminar study and oral presentations. A required Senior Capstone Seminar involves supervised independent study with written presentations and a final oral presentation. In addition to the required courses, a course in computer programming is strongly recommended. In addition, mathematics majors are required to complete a term of general physics, which provides them with another problem- solving experience and introduces them to the subject which was one of the primary motivations for the development of the calculus. Students who wish to pursue a special area of mathematics in greater depth may do so by taking additional courses in that area and by independent study with a faculty member in an area not specifically covered in a course. Among the areas available for such study are numerical methods, mathematical modeling, operations research, statistics, graph theory, combinatorics, and topology. For students who may be interested in engineering, Hartwick offers a Pre-Engineering Program and the opportunity to participate in a combined degree program with Columbia University or Clarkson University in which the student spends three years at Hartwick and two years at one of the engineering schools, earning a bachelor's degree from each in the process. Students majoring in other disciplines who wish to complete a minor in mathematics should notify the department of their intent as soon as possible, preferably by the junior year. Incoming students are administered an algebra placement test and, on the basis of the results, are advised which mathematics courses would be most appropriate for their algebra backgrounds. Pre-Calculus Mathematics (MATH 120) may be selected by students who need a stronger background in algebra before they begin the calculus sequence. For students with exceptional mathematics backgrounds, advanced placement credit in calculus will be granted on the basis of Advanced Placement Test scores. Advanced placement without credit also may be granted on the basis of consultation with the department faculty. A Math Center sponsored by the department offers problem sessions and tutoring for students enrolled in any of the department's service courses. Tutoring in math is available through The Center for Student Success. Note: Because of the significant overlap in requirements for the Mathematics and Actuarial Mathematics majors, no student may be credited with both majors. Faculty Charles H. Scheim, L.

Here, the best qualified men and women are building careers in laboratory medicine by applying their expert knowledge and practical skills. Medical technologists, whose broad background of college and clinical laboratory training provides the necessary ingredients for their professional responsibilities, fulfill a prominent role in these laboratories. Completion of the Medical Technology major as part of a liberal arts and sciences education offers students the breadth of knowledge and experience to handle the responsibilities and decisions they will face in their careers and the ability to adapt to changes within their profession. In addition, they will be prepared to lead full and satisfying lives. Students interested in preparing for a career in medical technology pursue a three-plus-one program leading to a Bachelor of Scienc e degree in medical technology. The program consists of three years of academic work at Hartwick followed by a 12-month clinical internship in the Rochester General Hospital Clinical Laboratory Technology Program in Rochester, NY. Following completion o f the internship, students will have earned the necessary 120 credits for the B. S. degree in Medical Technology from Hartwick, and a certificate indicating completion of the Clinical Laboratory Technology Program. They are then eligible to take the National Registry Examination, the passage of which earns the professional certification, MT (ASCP). Hartwick's three- plus-one program fulfills the requirements of the National Accrediting Agency for Clinical Laboratory Sciences. Medical technologists are licensed professionals within New York State. Licensing reflects recognition of the extensive clinical knowledge, subjective judgment, and critical decision-making skills that are required to practice this challenging profession. Academic work during the first three years at Hartwick involves an interdepartmental concentration of courses in biology, chemistry, biochemistry and mathematics (see the course list at the end of this section). Students should maintain a 3.0 grade point average in coursework to be considered for the clinical internship. If the grades are not high enough for admittance to the internship, or if the student changes his or her mind about becoming a medical technologist, he or she can complete the requirements for a major in Biology and graduate with a bachelor's degree in Biology. The specific requirements of Hartwick's Medical Technology major and the general College requirements for the baccalaureate degree permit sufficient flexibility for students to take advantage of numerous off-campus study programs applicable to the profession. This is in keeping with the multi-faceted responsibilities of professional medical technologists in such areas as computer programming, conducting lab tests, trouble-shooting equipment problems, business and personnel management, teaching, and report writing.

Coursework for this minor is complemented by the use of the College's Yager Museum of Art & Culture and its exhibitions and permanent collections when appropriate. The program provides students with theoretical and practical courses and experiences that enable them to understand and value the role museums play in our society. Students take museum studies courses in conjunction with a major or minor in an academic field most often associated with museums, such as anthropology, art, art history, English, education, history, business administration, or one of the sciences. Some students may opt to design their own Individual Student Program. Students who are interested in museum work and need advice about possible combinations of a major field with museum studies are encouraged to consult the coordinator of the program. Students who complete the minor w ill: Understand the many ways museums are used as intellectual resources, preservers and presenters of the world's culture, and places of enjoyment and entertainment Have a broader understanding of cultural diversity and the ways that museums reflect positions of power Have an intellectual understanding of how museums provide diverse educational opportunities by offering many different modes of learning Most museum studies course will include the following: Contemporary museum theory and practice Practical experience including hands-on activities using the museums' exhibits, collections and programs Field trips Community service Attendance at the Yager Museum's special events To complete the program students, take a total of six courses that include four required courses and a choice of at least two \"hands-on\" Yager Museum mini-practica. Because experience is highly valued in museum work, students are strongly encouraged to pursue additional opportunities such as a second internship or volunteer work in another museum. This minor prepares students to be: active supporters of museums; life-long learners who use museums; and possible graduate school attendees. In special cases, the museum studies minor provides opportunities for entry-level museum positions.

Nursing is an applied human science; therefore, in order to promote, maintain, or restore health a nurse must be able to apply critical thinking to a broad range of health concerns. The nurse must understand how individuals, families, communities, and/or populations experience health or health concerns and the myriad of conditions giving rise to health and health risk. Completion of Hartwick's baccalaureate nursing program, as part of a broader liberal arts and sciences education, enables the graduate to acquire the knowledge, skills, and attitudes needed to make a difference in the lives of others and the health care system. Unlike most other baccalaureate programs, Hartwick's professional nursing curriculum begins in the first year with a solid foundation in the biological, natural, social, and behavioral sciences. Electives in the humanities, required throughout the four-year academic program, complement the scientific and technical competencies required to apply a humanistic approach to professional practice. The professional component of the program, woven throughout the curriculum, helps students to gain essential knowledge, attitudes, and skills necessary to meet the increasingly complex and diverse needs of patients in today's healthcare environments. Study fosters the ability to communicate effectively, intervene therapeutically, critically think and clinically reason, and act as a responsible member o f society and the profession. Clinical practice centers on health promotion, risk reduction, and illness and disease management across the life span and continuum of care. In the senior year, the focus is on transitioning into the professional practice role with an emphasis on the development of systems thinking and skill in the management and coordination of care, clinical leadership, and the translation of evidence into practice. Courses in the freshman and sophomore years are sequential and are focused on the role of the nurse as a medical-surgical generalist. Courses in the junior and senior year focus on nursing care of special populations; course work at the junior level must be completed prior to entry in the senior year. Many courses within the major are prerequisites to other courses; this means the prerequisite course must be successfully completed in order for the student to enter subsequent courses in the curricular sequence. Because of the relationship between safe professional nursing practice and academic performance, nursing majors must meet departmental progression policies, academic standards within the College, and standards for professional accountability and ethical behavior. Nursing majors must earn a minimum grade of C in all courses required for the major to progress within the major. First year students are required to maintain a minimum cumulative grade point average of 2.0 or better to progress in the major; at the completion of the first 200 level clinical course (NURS 234) and beyond, students must maintain a cumulative GPA of 2.5 or better to progress in the major. Nursing is an applied science; as such, students must demonstrate mastery of theoretical knowledge and competency in the application of theory to the skillful practice of nursing. Nursing majors must successfully complete both the theoretical and laboratory portion of each nursing course in order to receive credit for the course. Upon successful completion of Hartwick's major in nursing, students receive a B.S. degree and are qualified to take the NCLEX-RN examination for licensure as a Registered Professional Nurse (RN). The baccalaureate degree in nursing program at Hartwick College is accredited by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (http://www.aacn.nche.edu/ccneaccreditation). The baccalaureate degree programs in nursing at Hartwick College are registered by the New York State Education Department. Educational Mobility for Registered Nurses Nurses who have graduated with a minimum GPA of 2.50 from an accredited U.S. institution with an associate's degree in nursing and who possess a license as a Registered Nurse (RN) may be accepted with advanced standing as candidates for a Bachelor of Science degree with a major in nursing (this includes 34 nursing credits, 10 science credits, and any other credits required to fulfill graduation requirements). Credit for courses completed with a grade of \"C\" or higher, from other accredited colleges that are similar to those offered at Hartwick is usually granted. A maximum number of 90 transferable credits are accepted towards completion of the baccalaureate degree. Thus, a minimum of 30 credits must be taken at Hartwick . Advanced standing course credit cannot be applied toward these 30 credits. Credits taken at another college for transfer to Hartwick must be approved in order for the credits to be accepted. This is done to protect the integrity of the student's program and the Hartwick degree. The transcripts and professional background of nurses who have graduated from a diploma school of nursing or from an institution in another country, and who possess a license as an RN, will be reviewed individually by Nursing's Academic Standing Committee. All external transfer students are required to furnish two letters of recommendation from faculty within their major. One form of the mobility program, the Partnership for Nursing Opportunities Program (PNOP) is designed to provide education t o students employed as Registered Professional Nurses (RNs) by Bassett Healthcare. Typically, participants in this program work three 156 days per week for Bassett Healthcare and take classes face- to-face two days per week or in a hybridized format (a blend of face- to- face and distance programming). Face- to-face classes are held either on Hartwick's campus or Bassett's main campus, located in Cooperstown, New York. The PNOP allows qualified RNs to achieve a baccalaureate degree in two calendar years, presuming all prerequisites are met on admission to the program. Through a system of scholarships provided by Hartwick College, Bassett Healthcare, and public and private sources, the entire tuition cost is free to the student. Students enrolled in this program are asked to commit to one year of additional employment at Bassett Healthcare for every year they are supported in the program. Accelerated Summer Program (ASP) The ASP is designed for those internal and external transfer students who have completed prerequisite course work usually completed during the first one- to-two years of the nursing curriculum. Those students completing first year pre-requisite course work are eligible for ASP I (2 summer courses) and those students completing all nursing prerequisites are eligible for ASP II (3 summer courses). At the completion of ASP I students will enter the nursing program at the sophomore level; those students completing ASP II will enter the nursing program at the junior level. Because of the rigor of this program, students must be in good academic standing with a cumulative GPA of 3.0 or above. Those who have completed the nursing prerequisites with a grade of B- or better are encouraged to apply. All transfer students are required to furnish two letters of recommendation from faculty within their major. Accelerated Baccalaureate in Nursing Program: Rural Nursing Opportunities Program (RNOP/18 Month Program) The Accelerated Baccalaureate in Nursing Program is an intensive 18-month hybrid educational program designed for adult students who have completed all of the nursing prerequisites as well as the general education requirements necessary for completion of a Bachelor of Science degree with a major in nursing at Hartwick College. Students with baccalaureate degrees in other disciplines, or those with significant college credits and a calculated cumulative GPA >/= 3.0 may apply; additionally, those who have completed the nursing prerequisites with a grade of B- or better are strongly encouraged to apply. Courses are taught using a blend of distance and on-site education methods. Classes and clinical/laboratory practicum experiences are generally held in the evenings and/or on weekends; although, exceptions are made, as necessary, for agencies or experiences that only operate Monday through Friday during the day time. Classes for this program begin in late May or early June. The total number of credits required for the Bachelor of Science degree with a major in nursing is 120 credits. The academic requirements of the Accelerated Baccalaureate in Nursing Program include a 69 credit curriculum. Upon review, transfer work may be determined to be equivalent. All applicants are required to furnish two letters of recommendation. Requirements for the Nursing Major: Students must hold current Basic Life Support (BLS) Certification for Healthcare Providers from the American Heart Association. Professional Liability Insurance Policy (available through the college for pre-licensure students). Health Requirements: each student must complete and submit: o a pre-entrance physical examination and subsequent annual physical examination; o completed immunization records including documentation of the annual influenza vaccine; o specific requirements for the nursing major, e.g., annual Mantoux test for Tb. *The forms that are required can be found on the Hartwick web site. Health requirements are subject to change at the request of the New York State Department of Health and/or our clinical affiliates; students will be expected to comply with those changes. The Department of Nursing is under no obligation to make special accommodations for those students who cannot comply with the health requirements. Licensed RNs who are students must submit a copy of their NY State Nurses License, their professional liability policy, and current CPR card. Drug testing and criminal background checks, including fingerprinting, may be required by clinical facilities. Findings from such inquiries may preclude the student from practicing in the clinical facility; in such cases, the Department and the College are not responsible for providing the student with an alternate learning experience. Students with previous criminal records must disclose this information at the time of consideration for licensure and should be aware that this may preclude them from being granted a license to practice. Should the student have any questions related to their future eligibility they should consult with the New York State Department of Education, Office of Professions. Transportation In most cases, students are responsible for providing their own transportation to a clinical site/experience. In cases where the College provides van service, transportation fees may apply. 157 Uniforms and Supplies Uniforms and name pins are ordered in the student's first year in the nursing program. As well, students are required to purchase a clinical kit (including stethoscope, blood pressure cuff, scissors, penlight), as well as a non-digital watch with second hand, books, and electronic subscriptions. Each nursing student will be billed for professional liability insurance, learning modules, and a lab fee of $50 for the 10 clinical courses in the program. Disclaimer While the College and the Department recognize and respect the cultural, spiritual, and religious beliefs and practices of others, nurses and, by extension, nursing students are required by the ANA's Code of Conduct (American Nurses Association, 2015) to provide care to diverse persons and groups. Students will not be excused from participating in the care of any persons and/or groups with diverse needs if it is a required element of the program.

As contemporary philosophers use the term, philosophy is a kind of reflection on and analysis of various other human activities. For example, philosophical analysis distinguishes between moral, religious and scientific discourse and reflects on how religion is related to morality on the one hand, and to science on the other. Philosophy in the western tradition dates back to the ancient Greeks, when Socrates, Plato, Aristotle and other thinkers explored the nature of reality and the means by which people come to know. Later philosophers such as Descartes, Hume and Kant refined and challenged earlier understandings of human existence. The study of philosophy compels students to examine fundamental questions and, in so doing, it better prepares them for life. As they become familiar with the teachings of the world's great philosophers, students also develop their ability to examine, clarify, analyze\u2014and care for\u2014 the natural and human world. Hartwick's philosophy program acquaints students with issues of contemporary philosophical inquiry, as well as the thinking o f important philosophers of the past. Major areas of study include epistemology , the study of how we come to know as well as the limits of what we can know; metaphysics , the study of reality; and ethics, the study of moral systems and the foundations of value. Departmental offerings include courses in the history of philosophy as well as systematic courses, which introduce students to the chief areas and topics of philosophical investigation. These courses, together with opportunities for directed individual study, permit students to do advanced and specialized work in philosophy and to develop competence in handling philosophical problems. Students who major in philosophy complete core courses in logic, the history of philosophy, and ethics. Additional courses in philosophy selected to complete the major requirements depend on a student's interests and future career goals. The major program culminates in a senior capstone research paper in an area of philosophical inquiry. Graduates with a major in philosophy have many options. Students who have majored in philosophy as undergraduates pursue graduate study in many other fields: law, medicine, social work, business, public administration, and, of course, philosophy. As a discipline that develops critical and creative thinking and writing, philosophy provides a good foundation for graduate study of nearly any sort. Faculty Stefanie Rocknak 163 Philosophy Courses 150 Topics in Philosophy (3 or 4 credits) A course with varying content aimed to introduce perennial themes and problems in philosophy. The topic will be announced in advance each time the course is offered. 161 The Socratic Project (3 credits) Socrates is one of the most fascinating figures in history. He lived a life that was totally dedicated to answering philosophical questions: What is moral? What is the nature of the good life? Is knowledge possible? His persistent attempt to answer these questions ultimately resulted in his execution. In a very real sense, Socrates died for philosophy. Our aim in this course will be to explore the Socratic project\u2014to examine the point, worth, and form of a life dedicated to intellectual inquiry. We will take particular pains to try to understand the force and significance of the famous imperative, said to characterize the Socratic life: 'Know thyself'. We will accomplish this by examining a number of important thinkers, all of whom spent their lives attempting to make sense of the world and our place in it. We will begin, of course, with Socrates, but our inquiry will lead us into the present\u2014into a consideration of inquiry as it currently exists in university settings. In addition to Socrates, we will read material from a diverse range of perspectives, all of which, in one way or another, are engaged in the attempt to understand the human condition. Material will include readings from Plato, Freud, Nietzsche, and Marx, as well as from more recent authors in fields such as evolutionary psychology and gender/race studies. (FYS) 201 Classics of Philosophy (3 credits) An introduction to the methods, concepts, and aims of philosophical inquiry through critical study of major philosophers such as Plato, Aristotle, Descartes, and Hume. 236 Logic (3 credits) Principles of deductive inference; traditional syllogistic and basic modern symbolic logic. (QFR) 249 Existentialism (3 credits) An exploration of the philosophical movement of existentialism as it has manifested itself in multiple contexts (in Europe, in the Caribbean, in Asia). Questions to be considered will include the nature of the self, the absurdity of existence, and how one might achieve a worthwhile life despite the inevitability of death. Philosophers to be read might include: Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Sartre, Fanon, Unamuno, Nishitani. 250 Topics in Philosophy (3 or 4 credits) A course concentrating on the thought of a single philosopher or school of philosophy, a major philosophical work or a specific problem in philosophy. The topic and the number of credits will be announced in advance, each time the course is offered. Topics in recent years have included Business Ethics, Bioethics, Death, Epistemology, and Philosophy of Language. No prerequisites. 260 Zen and Philosophy (4 credits) In this course we will explore the writings of some notable figures in the history of Zen and in 'the Kyoto school' of Japanese philosophy, examining the specific ways in which they try to articulate the philosophical underpinnings of Zen to a Western audience. (ILS) 261 Philosophy in Literature (3 credits) Philosophical questions concerning the nature of responsibility, the nature of the self, the meaning of a valuable life, and the terror of choice will be explored in selected works of fiction (works by, e.g. Albert Camus, Franz Kafka, J. M Coetzee, Fyodor Dostoevsky). 271 Values and Society (3 credits) An introduction to philosophical ethics, both theoretical and applied. Students are introduced to basic moral theories (deontology, utilitarianism, virtue ethics), as well as how these theories might be used to confront particular ethical issues. Students will analyze a variety of positions, critically assessing the merits and weaknesses of the available arguments. Topics to be considered may include: torture; animal environmentalism; economic inequality and world poverty. 273 Relativism (3 credits) Have you ever thought that \"everything is relative,\" or that \"there is no truth\" because \"everything is a matter of opinion?\" If so, believe it or not, you are already doing philosophy. In fact, you have ancient company: some 2,400 years ago, Protagoras championed the view that \"knowledge is a perception,\" and relatedly, that \"man is the measure of all things.\" In other words, he was one of the first full-blown relativists. In this class, we will examine just what it means to be a relativist, asking and answering the questions: Is it a good position to hold? Why or why not? To help us work through this topic, we will read one of Plato's dialogues, some contemporary literature, and watch a number of related films. 332 Philosophy of Religion (3 credits) What is religion? Is there a God? What is the value of religious experience? Is it possible to be religious without being superstitious? Answers to these and related questions will be examined in the analytical manner appropriate to philosophy. (ILS) 336 Ethics (3 credits) Exploration of the major moral theories of the western philosophical tradition (utilitarianism, deontology, virtue ethics), as well as challenges to this tradition. Students will examine questions concerning the possibility of moral knowledge and moral expertise, the relationship between reason and value, and the limits of our best attempts to grapple with the question of how to live. Prerequisite: at least one college course in philosophy. 164 337 Philosophy of Art (3 credits) Analysis of various points of view on such topics as the definition of art; aesthetic experience; the form, matter and content of art; emotion and expression; the psychological function of art; criticism; and evaluation. We will also ask, and attempt to answer, six fundamental questions: 1. What is art? 2. What is the proper \"aesthetic encounter\" if any? 3. How do we evaluate a work of art? 4. Can we learn from art? 5. Why do we enjoy tragedy/horror? 6. Where is the artist in the work of art? Active class participation and interest in the material is crucial. (ILS) 350 Topics in Philosophy (3 or 4 credits) A course concentrating on the thought of a single philosopher or school of philosophy, a major philosophical work or a specific problem in philosophy. The topic and the number of credits will be announced in advance; each time the course is offered. Recent topics have included Love and Sexual Morality, Phenomenology, and Naturalism. Recent philosophers covered have included Kant, Nietzsche, Heidegger and Sartre. Permission of the instructor required. (ILS) 370 Philosophy of Mind (4 credits) What can a science such as psychology tell us about the workings of the mind? What are the philosophies of some of the major psychological movements? While these topics constitute the broader context of the course, we also will explore issues such as the following: To what extent is one born with one's ideas, skills or talents, and to what extent do these depend on one's environment? How does the mind represent the external world? Do computers \"think;\" are they \"conscious?\" How does understanding of the brain affect understanding of human psychology? To what extent is human intelligence like that of other animals? (ILS) 381 Ancient Greek Philosophy (4 credits) This course is a survey of the major achievements and figures of Classical Greek philosophy and their influence on thinkers in the Hellenistic period and late antiquity. There will be a special focus on the thinkers Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle. Other schools of thought discussed will include the Sophists, Epicureanism, and Stoici sm. Some major topics of the course will include Ancient Greek scientific views on the origins of the universe, the nature of the human soul, happiness, love and friendship, and the ideal government. 383 Modern Philosophy: Descartes to Kant (4 credits) As Luther broke with the Catholic Church in the opening years of the sixteenth century, Copernicus dared to proclaim that the earth was not the center of the universe. The stage had been set for an intellectual revolution; in virtue of the burgeoning success of scientific inquiry, paired with a renewed confidence in rationality, human beings began to perceive themselves as the \"masters of the universe.\" \"Modernity\" was ushered in as a previously unquestioned obedience to Church and God slipped away. In this class, we will carefully examine four philosophers who helped to shape this dramatic and rich moment in history: Descartes, Leibniz, Hume and Kant (as well as a number of relatively unknown women philosophers). 490 Senior Capstone Seminar (3 credits) Philosophy Major Requirements: 10 courses in Philosophy to include: At least six courses at 250 or above At least four courses at 300 or above One logic course: PHIL 236 Logic Two of Three History of Philosophy courses*: PHIL 201 Classics of Philosophy PHIL 381 Ancient Philosophy PHIL 383 Modern Philosophy *This requirement also can be satisfied by taking courses on particular philosophers within these periods (e.g. a course on Plato, Aristotle, Hume, or Kant) One course in values: PHIL 271 Values and Society OR PHIL 336 Ethics Two courses in recent Philosophy covering two of the following: 19th or 20th Century Philosophy Contemporary Approaches to Philosophical Issues A Major Philosopher of the recent past Three elective courses in Philosophy 165 Complete PHIL 490 Senior Capstone Seminar.

Required for NYS coaching program . Prerequisite: PE 203. 169 Physics Physics, the most fundamental of the sciences, deals with the laws describing the behavior of matter and energy. From the study of physics, students acquire not only knowledge of the subject itself, but valuable training in analytical thinking and a quantitative approach to problem solving which will be useful in both their professional and personal lives. At the same time, an understanding of the language and analytical methods of science, and of the fundamental principles of physics, offers preparation for life in a future heavily influenced by science and technology. A major or minor in physics can be combined with study in other disciplines to produce particularly strong future employment credentials. Course requirements for the major in physics provide students with a broad and flexible background in the discipline, and enable them to develop analytical skills necessary to pursue a career in physics or a related field. Students are introduced to the major sub- disciplines within classical and modern physics: optics, relativity, mechanics, electricity and magnetism, thermodynamics, atomic and nuclear physics, quantum mechanics, and electronics. In addition, majors must take courses in general chemistry, calculus, an d differential equations. Beyond the minimum requirements, students can tailor their academic programs to meet their interests and needs. Students considering graduate study in physics, for example, are encouraged to take additional courses in physics and mathematics. In addition to advanced courses in an area of interest, majors can pursue a particular area through directed study with a faculty member. A senior project also is required for the major. Some recent senior projects include measuring the phase transitions in a ferroelectric solid, the drag force on a smooth sphere, and computer- generated holograms. Those students interested in engineering can earn a B.A. degree in physics from Hartwick and an engineering degree from Clarkson University or Columbia University through the College's \"dual degree\" program. Arrangements with other institutions are possible as well. Under this program, a student spends three years at Hartwick and two at an engineering school, graduating with a bachelor's degree from each school. In addition, a student may complete four years at Hartwick, earning a bachelor's degree in physics, and then spend two years at the engineering school and earn a master's of science degree in engineering. Students interested in either option should begin their study of physics and mathematics early in their college career in order to fulfill requirements without difficulty. Freshmen who may be considering a major in physics should take Light & Relativity (PHYS 160) and Single Variable Calculus (MATH 121) in their first term at Hartwick. However, a full physics major may be completed starting as late as the beginning of the sophomore year, providing a student has taken Single Variable Calculus as a freshman.

Political Science Major Requirements: 12 courses (m inimum of 34 credits) in Political Science, distributed as follows: POSC 101 U.S. Government and Politics OR POSC 107 Freedom, Equality, and Power POSC 105 International Relations OR POSC 108 Intro to Comparative Politics POSC 209 Political Science Research Methods POSC 489 Senior Thesis Methods (must be taken the same semester as 490) POSC 490 Senior Thesis Seven additional courses in the discipline, including at least three classroom courses at the 300 level. The department encourages all majors to acquire a broad exposure to the discipline by sampling courses in all four of the principal areas of study. A model program would include at least one course above the 100 level from each of the following areas: (A) U.S. Politics (B) International Relations (C) Comparative Politics (D) Political Theory Note: This model is required for departmental distinction. Normally, the department will accept no more than three transferred Political Science courses (up to the equivalent of 9 Hartwick credits) toward the Hartwick College Political Science major. Political Science Minor Requirements: Minimum of six courses (18 credits) in political science, distributed as follows: POSC 101 U.S. Government and Politics OR POSC 107 Freedom, Equality, and Power POSC 105 International Relations OR POSC 108 Intro to Comparative Politics At least one classroom courses at the 300 level Three additional courses in the discipline 178 Pre-Medicine and Pre-Allied Health Program Requirements: BIOL 101 Biology in Practice BIOL 203Concepts of Biology: Biological Information BIOL 202 Concepts of Biology: Energy and Resources CHEM 107 General Chemistry I, CHEM 108 General Chemistry II , OR CHEM 109 Advanced General Chemistry CHEM 201 Organic Chemistry I CHEM 202 Organic Chemistry II PHYS 201 General Physics I PHYS 202 General Physics II PHYS 140 Principles of Physics I PHYS 141 Principles of Physics II An English literature course and ENGL 101 Composition course Although many of the requirements for entrance into professional programs are the same for each medical field, carefully note that some fields, as well as some schools, have additional or other requirements (e.g. allied health fields require Anatomy and Physiology). 179 Psychology Hartwick's rigorous psychology program emphasizes the scientific method and empirical approach in its study of human behavior and mental processes. Experimental psychologists are committed to the idea that through objective empirical observations, progress can be made in understanding, predicting, and modifying behavior. Students who major in psychology acquire knowledge of major theoretical frameworks and hone research skills in observation, experimental design, data analysis, and scientific report writing. A major in psychology provides an appropriate background for a variety of professions in which an understanding of the principles of human behavior is important. Graduate study in medicine, law, human factors, neuroscience, or social work, as well as in psychology, might all follow an undergraduate major in psychology. The undergraduate program in psychology, like pre-medical and pre-law programs, does not provide the specialized training needed to be a professional psychologist, which requires a graduate degree as an indication of competence.

The newly created major in public health brings to bear the interdisciplinary resources of the liberal arts on the challenges of building healthier communities in an increasingly complex and dynamic world. It holistically combines foundational concepts in the science of human health and disease with theories and methods of public health data collection, and an appreciation of the socioeconomic and cultural factors that impact health. The public health major also emphasizes the value of experience out in the community, where students can put into practice the ideas and methods they have learned in their public health courses. Fieldwork, whether through a course, a clinical placement, or a n internship, is a core component of the public health major. Hartwick College's location in a town that is a regional hub for healthcare and social services is ideally suited to a focus on the urgent contemporary issues related to rural public health. As the world becomes increasingly urban, resources essential to health become more concentrated in cities, creating economic, educational, and healthcare challenges for rural populations. Hartwick's network of local community partners in the Susquehanna Valley region, and its off- campus J-Term courses in places like Thailand, Dominican Republic, and South Africa, afford rich opportunities for students to engage meaningfully with public health where affordable and sustainable solutions are most needed. Upon completing a major in public health, students will be prepared for a broad array of career or graduate study opportunities in fields that include epidemiology, biostatistics, health education, health policy, environmental health, emergency preparedness, health communications, consumer health and safety, and community health project management. Teaching Faculty and Steering Committee Connie Anderson (Anthropology); James Buthman (Political Wellman (Psychology); Jake Wolff (English) Courses PUBH 100 Foundations of Public Health (3 credits ) This course will introduce students to the core concepts and methods in the field of public health, a field which has long been understood as the \"science and art of preventing disease, prolonging life, and promoting physical health and efficiency through organized community efforts.\" Public health measures are the reason that more people today live longer, healthier lives than they did one century ago, although there are still vast disparities in health throughout the world that remain to be addressed. Through a brief survey of the history and philosophy of public health as it has developed in the United States and in other regions of the world, this course will offer students an initial exposure to some of the methods and tools of public health data collection. A closer, more-detailed examination of a few case studies will increase students' understanding of the ethical, economic, and policy-related dimensions of public health, and why communications and knowledge of the underlying science of human health and disease are essential to successful public health initiatives. No prerequisites. PUBH 110 Global Public Health (3 credits) This course will introduce students to the core concepts and methods in the field of global health. National Institutes of Health has proposed definition for global health as collaborative trans- national research and action for promoting health for all. This course focuses on common health problems faced by the human population as a whole. The course explores foundations of global health as a professional and academic discipline, and provides an overview of global health research methods and social determinants of health. Other topics covered in this introductory course include: prevention of neonatal and pediatric deaths worldwide, chronic non- communicable diseases and aging, prevention and control of infectious diseases, environmental health, major initiatives to address global concerns like tuberculosis, malaria, HIV/AIDS; emerging issues of globalization and global health like emerging infectious diseases and bioterrorism, and the priority areas for global health in the 21st century. No prerequisites. PUBH 200 Epidemiology (4 credits) This course will introduce core descriptive and analytical epidemiological concepts such as the epidemiological triad, natural history of disease, measurement of occurrence of disease and screening criteria. Students will review and outline various epidemiological study methods including clinical trials, case 183 control, cohort, and cross sectional as they relate to risk association and causation. Concurrently they will compare genetic and environmental influences on health. They will test the efficacy of disease prevention and treatment programs, evaluation of health services and policy implementation. Students will learn of ethical principles applying to epidemiology, throughout the course. An emphasis in this course will be on student engagement involving case study review, real-life application and student led projects on current public health issues. Pre-Requisite or Co-Requisite: MATH 108 or PSYC 291 or SOCI 383 (QFR) PUBH 490 Senior Capstone in Public Health (3 credits) In this course, students will research an issue in public health that is relevant to the cohesive theme they designed for their major and write a formal research paper analyzing the issue. Pre- Requisites: Senior, Public Health major status; completion of at least 35 credits in the Public Health major, including PUBH 101, PUBH 201, and PUBH 205. Public Health Major Requirements 38 credits distributed as follows: PUBH 101 Foundations of Public Health PUBH 201 Global Public Health PUBH 205 Epidemiology BIOL 150 Human Biology OR approved health-related Biology, Chemistry, or Psychology course MATH 108 Statistics OR approved health-related quantitative analysis course POSC 292 Public Policy OR approved health policy course PHIL 336 Ethics OR approved course addressing ethics and values 12 credits of approved Public Health electives , drawn from the list below and forming a cohesive theme relevant to the student's interest in public health At least 4 courses (minimum 12 credits) must be taken at the 300-level or above (this may include core courses). 80 hours of field work (equivalent to a 2-credit internship) PUBH 490 Senior Capstone in Public Health Public Health Minor Requirements: Minimum of 20 credits PUBH 101 Foundations of Public Health PUBH 201 Global Public Health PUBH 205 Epidemiology 10 credits of approved Public Health electives , drawn from the list below and forming a cohesive theme relevant to the student's interest in public health At least 2 courses (minimum 6 credits) must be taken at the 300-level or above Grades for all courses taken in Public Health are used to calculate the average in the major for Departmental Distinction. Public Health Electives Students majoring in public health are required to define a cohesive theme for their chosen electives, in consultation with their advisor in the major, as part of PUBH 100 Foundations of Public Health. This is part of developing a vital \"habit of mind\" for future graduate study or careers in public health - namely, the ability to recognize the intersection of multiple factors in matters of public health. Students identify an area of public health that interests them (such as rural public health, health maintenance, gender identity and violence, diet and nutrition, global public health) and the electives that will help them acquire relevant knowledge and methodologies in this area. The Public Health Steering Committee will discourage over-emphasis on a single discipline. 184 The list of public health electives below will be reviewed and revised periodically by the Public Health Steering Committee to reflect course and seat availability, as well as the creation of new courses. Some electives have pre-requisites, yet students coming to the public health major from other majors may already have completed those pre-requisites, and professors may choose to waive pre- requisites at their discretion. *Some electives that do not focus solely on public health coul d be appropriate for the public health major if a student's projects within the course are related to public health. Similarly, topics courses could be appropriate if the topic for that section is related to public health. In both cases, these courses are designated by an asterisk (*).

While a wide range of social and ethnic groups may be considered, emphasis is given to those populations that have historically borne the brunt of discrimination, exploitation, and enslavement in the process of Euro-American colonial and imperial expansion. The program's comparative focus assumes that there are general processes that underlie the formation of ethnic identity and \"race\" relations in a wide range of social and national contexts. To this end, the minor provides access to a range of analytical tools with which to examine the histories, experiences, and cultures of diverse racial and ethnic groups and their relationships to each other and to those dominant social forms in which they are enmeshed. Objectives of the Race and Ethnic Studies minor are: to provide students with an understanding of the socially constructed \"nature\" of race and ethnicity; to help students understand the debates about the biological basis of human diversity; to teach the histories, cultures and contributions of various racial and ethnic groups in ways that highlight the differences and similarities of ethnic experience and expression as well as the responses to racial/ethnic discrimination and its relationship to other historical inequalities such as class and gender; o to help prepare students to participate in an increasingly diverse world and promote a more just society; o to provide opportunities for students to experience racial and ethnic contexts that take them beyond their own cultural backgrounds. In keeping with Hartwick's Liberal Arts in Practice, the goal of this program is to prepare students for the shifting arrangements of life and work in this century. Course work in the minor also introduces students to the history of the conceptual debates about race and ethnicity, as well as to the range of analytical approaches currently influential within interdisciplinary scholarship on ethnicity and race relations. Coordinator Dr. Robert Seguin, Department of English Race and Ethnic Studies Courses Introductory Course: All students are required to take an Introductory Course on race or ethnicity which prepares them to look at the materials in their area of focus with reference to current scholarly discourse. Students are encouraged to take this course as early as possible and before completing the other requirements of the minor. Students may select as their Introductory Course one of the following or an alternative course approved by the program coordinator: ANTH 250 Hispanic and African-American Cultures ENGL 245 African American Literature HIST 104 Race & Ethnicity in American History HIST 164 FYS Race & Identity POSC 150 FYS Politics of Race and Gender SOCI 225 Human Rights SOCI 251 Race & Ethnicity Capstone Seminar : The Capstone Seminar is designed to explore a set of significant social and ethical issues from several cultural and ethnic perspectives. In the process, students will be encouraged to apply the knowledge and analytical skills they have acquired while pursuing the mino r in Race and Ethnic Studies. This will be carried out through a dialogue with their peers and the faculty seminar leader(s). More specifically, the seminar seeks to: recognize and examine the complexity of the social, personal and moral questions involved in addressing U.S. cultural diversity; develop in a student a capacity for listening, understanding and applying concepts, techniques and value assessments applied by their peers or the faculty seminar leader(s) to the issues at hand. Other Courses in Race and Ethnic Studies: 186 The Race and Ethnic Studies minor at Hartwick offers students an opportunity to enhance their studies and career opportunities within a flexible course framework that is interdisciplinary in nature. Among the recent offerings: THEORETICAL HIST 104 Race & Ethnicity in American History SOCI 251 Race & Ethnicity UNITED STATES RELS 103 Religious Diversity in America HIST 150 Intro to Native American History ENGL 245 African American Literature EDUC 220 Philosophy & Sociology of Education POSC 250 Immigration Politics & Policy EDUC 320 Interdisciplinary Curriculum & Instruction ENGL 378 American Indian Literature INTERNATIONAL ART 102 World Art History I: Ancient ART 103 World Art History II: 10-17th Century ART 104 World Art History III: Modern POSC 105 International Relations RELS 106 World Religions HIST 153 Africa RELS 222 Buddhism ANTH 223 Cultural Anthropology HIST 225 History of Brazil RELS 239 Islam RELS 245 Studying Religion: Vodou/Voodoo ANTH 250 Resistance & Rebellion RELS 250 Cultures of Ancient Near East HIST 251 Native American-US Relations HIST 251 Revisiting Roots HIST 253 Africa INTR 310 Travels to Third World HIST 324 Slavery in Latin America and the Caribbean HIST 326 Gender & Power in Latin America ANTH 335 Third World Studies/South Africa SPAN450 Seminar in Hispanic Study (S) Race and Ethnic Studies Minor Requirements To obtain a minor in Race and Ethnic Studies one must complete six courses, two of which are core to all students in the minor. No more than two courses in the student's major field may count toward the minor. The core courses are the Introductory Course and the Capstone Seminar. Introductory Course In the Introductory Course (Theory/History) all students, regardless of concentration, are required to take an introductory course on race and ethnicity. This course will prepare students to look at the material in their area of concentrations with reference to current theory in the study of ethnicity. Students are encouraged to take this course as early as possible and before completing the other requirements of the minor. Capstone Seminar The Capstone Seminar is designed to explore a set of significant social and ethical issues from several cultural and ethnic perspectives. In the process, students will be encouraged to apply the knowledge and analytical skills they have acquired while pursuing the minor in Race and Ethnic Studies. The Capstone course should be a 400-level seminar outside of the student 's major, though on occasion a 300-level course may fulfill the requirement (by permission of the professor and the program coordinator). Area Courses The remaining four courses can be taken from among those deemed by the program to have a suitable focus on race and/or ethnicity. Students will work with their advisors and the program coordinator to group together a set of courses that offers a coherent intellectual focus. Students thus have the opportunity to design a concentration that reflects their interests. 187 Religious Studies The world's great religions are centered on the quest to find meaning and purpose in human life and existence. Religious beliefs and practices in various ways address not only what it means to be human, but also concepts such as good and evil, right and wrong. These beliefs and practices, in turn, help to shape the character of individual societies and cultures. Therefore, knowledge of religion and its various manifestations is indispensable to a study of the diverse social and cultural phenomena we encounter in the world around us. Hartwick's curriculum covers three areas. One focuses on the monotheistic traditions. Various courses in biblical studies take a historical approach examining the Bible in terms of its ancient historical and cultural contexts. Other courses in this area focus on Judaism, Christianity and Islam, providing students with an understanding of the impact that these Middle Eastern traditions have had upon the Western cultural heritage. The second area covers the religious traditions of the Asian world, particularly Buddhism and Hinduism. There are also opportunities for studying other isolated non-Western religions (Sikhism, Zoroastrianism, Confucianism, Taoism, Shinto, Jainism). The primary aim is to provide students with fundamental conceptual frameworks for understanding the major non-Western cultures of the world in which these various religious traditions have been influential. The third area deals with recent and contemporary religious expression in the West and includes courses on religion in the United States, new religious movements, and the relationship between religion and modern culture, including literature, science, medicine, entertainment, technology, politics, and social change. These courses use historical, literary, philosophical, and social scientific approaches to explore the challenges faced by religious traditions during the modern era, as well as their dynamism and adaptability. Special study opportunities available through the department include off-campus programs in India, the Middle East, Washington DC, and New York City, usually offered periodically during January Terms in alternate years. Furthermore, because Oneonta is uniquely situated within a few hours drive of various important Buddhist, Christian, Jewish, Muslim, and Hindu monasteries and centers , efforts are made to incorporate field trip experiences into regular course offerings. Courses also visit sacred sites, museums, and memorials in major urban centers such as Washington, DC and New York City. Each student who wishes to major in Religious Studies must develop a program of study in the discipline in consultation with a faculty advisor. Majors also are encouraged to complement their study with courses in a variety of other disciplines which will enable them to understand more fully the interconnections among religion, history, literature, philosophy, the social sciences, art, and the sciences. Many students majoring in other departments choose to continue their interest in religion and religious phenomena by pursuing a minor in Religious Studies. Guidelines for both major and minor are described below. Students with a special interest in combining the study of Philosophy with Religious Studies can pursue one of three degree options: 1) an 18-course double major; 2) a ten-course major (with senior thesis) in one program and a six course minor in the other; or 3) a 14- course major in Philosophy and Religious Studies, with one senior thesis bridging both disciplines. Students should meet with members of the Department of Philosophy and Religious Studies to design the degree program that best suits their interests. The departmental program offers the breadth and depth of study to prepare students to better understand the world, its diverse people and cultures, the challenges of the future, and the resources of the religious imagination that may help inspire us to engage the world and the future more responsibly. In the past, religious studies graduates have been drawn to careers in a diverse range of professions, including law, journalism, medicine, teaching, counseling, public relations, community organization, not-for-profit agencies, and even government service. Some have gone on to religious vocations, from Christian ministers to Buddhist monks. Others have chosen to continue the academic study of religion at the graduate level. Faculty C.W.

Sociology provides insight into social relationships among individuals, couples, families, organizations, political institutions, social movements, and globally. It examines social structuring based on race, ethnicity, nationality, sex, religion, age, and class. The study of sociology as part of a liberal education helps students develop a critical understanding of the workings of societal forces. The department presents a wide range of theoretical perspectives. Research areas include health, demography, social and political history and movements, youth, criminology and criminal justice, rural poverty, social welfare, public policy, third world studies, human rights, domestic violence, indigenous rights, and globalization. In addition to a rich theoretical mix, the department encompasses a broad range of pedagogical approaches. Faculty utilize videos, participant observation exercises, role playing, ethnography, film analysis, basic and advanced statistical analysis, journal writing, community-based advocacy and service learning, field trips, faculty-student collaborative research, and guest speakers as well as traditional lectures in their teaching. While most department courses consider issues of race, class and gender, the department also offers specific courses examining issues of race, class, gender, and cultural identity in the U.S. Many of our courses fulfill the requirements for the Race and Ethnic Studies Program. Race and Ethnicity and Multiculturalism are entry level courses for this minor. We also have a departmental affiliation with the Women's and Gender Studies Program. Special study opportunities available through the department include off-campus programs in Ireland and Charleston, NC. Other opportunities include social advocacy work with agencies and organizations, internships in related careers in the local community an d in other locations throughout the country, and community-based service-learning projects. Majors may also participate in the College- affiliated Great Lakes Colleges Association Philadelphia Urban Semester. The Hardy Chair Lecture Program grants students the special opportunity to interact with nationally and internationally recognized scholars and practitioners. The Sociology major is composed of six required courses, and five electives. Electives may be organized to construct a focused area of study (eg. social work, community advocacy, social and political rights and social movements). In addition, the department offers a minor and major in Criminal Justice (CRMJ). The department recommends the following course sequence for the major: First Year: SOCI 105 Introduction to Sociology Second Year: SOCI 310 Classical Social Theory SOCI 397 Contemporary Theory Third Year: SOCI 385 Qualitative Analysis AND SOCI 383 Quantitative Analysis OR SOCI 384 Quantitative Analysis in Criminal Justice Fourth Year: SOCI 490 Senior Capstone Seminar And 5 electives. A senior thesis is optional All CRMJ courses with the exception of CRMJ 490 Senior Thesis may count as electives, with the exception of SOCI 383/SOCI 384 Quantitative Analysis may not count towards both majors. Please note: If you are in the 3-year or Education Program, you will need to take both Classical Theory and Qualitative Methods in fall and Contemporary Theory and Quantitative Methods in the spring of your sophomore year. Please note: If you wish to combine a sociology major and criminal justice minor, you must complete all requirements for both including 8 total electives (5 sociology and 3 from CRMJ minor list). The only course that may count for both the sociology major and CJ minor is SOCI 384 Quantitative Methods in Criminal Justice. A major in Sociology prepares students for graduate study in the discipline, as well as in a variety of other fields including law, counseling, teaching, social work, public health, education and criminal justice. The understanding of how people interact and behave in groups provides an excellent background for a wide range of careers in such fields as law enforcement, business, education, and government service. In addition, majors have used their background in sociology to pursue careers in communications, community relations, human resources management, and community organizing and advocacy. 192 Faculty Reid M.

Sociology in Ireland - Next we introduce the discipline of sociology and start to examine Irish society from a sociological perspective. We will spend a significant amount of time examining the specific development of Irish culture. Modern Irish Society - In order to understand modern Irish society, we need to look at social institutions and social indices. Irish Culture - The values and beliefs of the Irish are reflected in their culture. For this section we need to return to some history to examine such issues as the Diaspora, the famine, and the revolutionary movements. Modern Irish society - It is here where we look more closely at the puzzle of Northern Ireland as well as the impact of the so-called Celtic Tiger on the Republic. It is also here where we need to examine the modern dimensions of race, class and gender in Ireland. 240 Women and Social Change (4 credits) This course investigates how societies structure gender and how race, class, and gender intersect.

Prerequisite: SOCI 105 and SOCI 285. (ILS) 310 Classical Social Theory (3 credits) This is a course intended to introduce students to the works of early western social theorists. Classical social theory provides the foundation for current sociological thinking and is fundamental to the understanding of ongoing discussions within the discipline. This course will primarily emphasize the works of the Founding Three: Karl Marx, Max Weber, and Emile Durkheim. We will also explore other nineteenth and twentieth century theorists including Charlotte Perkins Gilman, W.E.B. DuBoisand others, as the semester allows. In tackling the (primarily) 19th and early 20th century writings, we will analyze the theoretical concepts of these sociological thinkers in relation to current social problems and dilemmas.

Prerequisite: SOCI 105. 311 (Also CRMJ 320) Juvenile Delinquency (3 credits) This course offers an introductory survey of the study of juvenil e delinquency and the Juvenile Justice system in the U.S. Crucial to this examination is a framework based upon the understanding of two central issues: the social definition of adolescent years in American society, and how the justice system treats behavior which society views as unacceptable or deviant. To this end, this course focuses on: the social status of juveniles of different status positions and the often conflicting expectations and opportunities for those adolescents in contemporary American society, the operation of the juvenile justice system in the formal and informal decision making and processing of that form of juvenile behavior broadly defined as \"delinquency,\" current dimensions and trends, differing major theoretical perspectives which have been developed to explain juvenile delinquency, and the range of options society has available to help prevent, treat, and/or punish delinquent\" behavior. Prerequisite: SOCI 105 or SOCI 285. 321 Introduction to Social Work (4 credits) Social welfare public policy is undergoing the most significant change since the New Deal. These changes are based upon competing ideas about the nature of individual and community responsibility. This course explores these ideas to uncover their underlying assumptions, value properties and social impacts on the lives of individuals, groups and communities. To aid in this understanding, this course examines major social concerns including poverty, violence, alcohol and other drug use, mental illness, crime, healthcare issues and discrimination. Throughout this course we examine the roles of social workers in addressing these social \"problems.\" In addition, this course offers an introduction to case management, group work, community organization and social work administration.

Both regions blend diverse religious, linguistic, and intellectual traditions: from the Jewish, Muslim, and Christian influences in Spain to the diversity of indigenous and African cultures in Latin America. Students majoring in Spanish at Hartwick will gain an appreciation of the linguistic and cultural diversity of the 20 countries in the world where Spanish is spoken through an exploration of their literatures, film, art, music, and other cultural production. The importance of studying the cultures and literatures of the Spanish-speaking world and learning the Spanish language is underscored by the fact that the United States is the fourth largest Spanish-speaking country in the world. Knowledge of the Spanish language and Hispanic cultural diversity is vital for business, both foreign and domestic, health care and social services, international relations, politics, government, education, and many other fields. In addition, an understanding of Hispanic cultures, civilizations, and language gained through courses offered by the Department of Modern Languages is a valuable component of a liberal arts education designed to prepare students for an increasing global interconnection and the rising importance of Hispanic communities within the U.S. cultural fabric. The Spanish major at Hartwick is designed to develop fluency in both oral and written language communication as well as broaden each student's global perspective through a critical understanding of multiculturalism in Hispanic countries and the U.S. In addition to the variety of language, culture, and literature courses offered on the Hartwick campus, the program offers an opportunity to prepare for a career in translation and interpretation, as well as the benefits of practical experience through internships and partnerships with local and foreign organizations. A traditional minor in Spanish is a valuable complement to any major and an important skill in many careers and fields. Students whose major fields orient them toward a career in business, healthcare, law, or social services are encouraged to consider a Spanish for the Professions minor , which focuses more narrowly on the language skills necessary in these contexts. A student interested in completing a minor in Spanish is encouraged to consult with a member of the Spanish faculty in order to pursue a program that best suits their interests and career goals. Students majoring and minoring in Spanish are encouraged to broaden their understanding in the field by taking related courses in other disciplines and in the Latin American and Caribbean Studies Program. Spanish faculty regularly organize off-campus study-abroad and service-learning programs. Students minoring in Spanish are encouraged to participate in these January Term or semester-abroad opportunities. All Spanish majors are required to participate in a departmentally approved immersive experience abroad or domestic. Students interested in earning teacher certification in Spanish may do so by completing the requirements for the major, taking the psychology and education courses required for certification, and student teaching in Spanish. (See Education.) Spanish majors who have recently graduated from Hartwick have gone on to teach or to graduate schools both here and abroad, and have found employment in banks, insurance companies, social service agencies and many other fields in which knowledge of the Spanish language and Hispanic cultures is becoming increasingly advantageous.

At Hartwick College our students are actively engaged in the accumulated knowledge and literature of the theatre by creating performances for audiences. This is true for our first year students as well as our sophomores, juniors and seniors. From your first semester in classes and productions at Hartwick you will be engaged in theatre-making. Through this process you learn because you need to know things about history, poetry, science, art, language, philosophy, sociology, and psychology. These and all the other disciplines in the liberal arts are bound up in the dramatic literature and performance arts of our world. To study the art of performance and production is to sharpen the skills of observation, communication, and critical thinking. Hartwick's Theatre Arts curriculum is specifically designed to be part of a liberal education and to meet the needs of students planning a career in theatre, those interested in using theatre skills to enhance other careers, as well as those who choose theatre merely as a way to enrich their lives. The three core courses\u2014Introduction to Theatre, Play Production, and Senior Project\u2014 all deal with the process of analyzing a script, conceiving and designing a production, then rehearsing and presenting a performance. Using a combination of classroom study and practical experience, these courses are intended to develop progressively the producer/director/designer, a person capable of taking a play from an idea to a polished performance. The rest of the curriculum is intended to support and extend the core and covers acting methods, production design, theatre history, and dramatic literature. A great deal of the learning in Theatre Arts takes place outside the classroom: in the rehearsal hall, in the scene shop, and in our two performance spaces. A typical year will see three major productions and as many as 15 student-directed, faculty-mentored plays. The Theatre Arts program also offers technical support to the Hartwick dance program and to visiting dance, theatre, and musical events. Developing actors, directors, designers, and technicians find plenty of chances to hone their skills at Hartwick. New-play development is featured at Hartwick. The close relationship with the writing program in English has led to the production of several original plays written by both students and professionals. The most notable of these were Ghost Dance, written for Hartwick by Nobel Laureate Derek Walcott\u2014a Region II winner in the American College Theatre Festival XXII, and student Rob Shimko's Specks, the co-winner of the Michael Kanin National Short Play Award for the Kennedy Center/American College Theatre Festival XXX. The student drama club, Cardboard Alley Players, and the drama honorary, Alpha Psi Omega, are very active. They promote theatre trips and host visits by theatre professionals as well as mount their own plays and musicals. January Term off-campus classes are offered in New York City and England. These courses provide more opportunities to see professional productions and to meet th e people who produce them. And Theatre students are encouraged to pursue the many internship and apprentice opportunities offered by professional theatre companies in our area and around the Northeast. Recent Theatre Arts graduates have gone\u2014some directly and some with additional training\u2014into positions at the Smithsonian Discovery Theatre, MSNBC TV, the Vineyard Theatre (NYC), Adirondack Scenic Studios, Manhattan Children's Theatre, Glimmerglass Opera, SeaWorld, the Theatre Development Fund and more. Others have used their theatre training as part of their preparation for work in film, television, and teaching. Equally important, however, are those students who have graduated from Hartwick with majors other than theatre, who will continue to enrich their lives with an informed love of the performing arts developed by learning and doing on Hartwick's stages.

Course Registration Policies Account Holds A financial hold may be placed on a student's account preventing course registration changes and release of official transcripts and other credentials if a student has an outstanding financial obligation with the College. Course registration changes and release of transcripts or other credentials are not permitted until a hold has been cleared. If an enrolled student does not address holds issued by any administrative office prior to the start of a term or within the first seven days of fall or spring term or first three days of January or any Summer term, he or she will be withdrawn from the institution. Specifically, a student who has one or more holds on his or her account and is not attempting to resolve the hold(s) by 5 p.m. on Thursday of the first week of fall or spring terms will have his or her WICKit account frozen the next day (Friday) by 9 a.m. A student whose account has been frozen and has not resolved or attempted to resolve a hold on his or her account by 5 p.m. the followi ng Tuesday will be dropped from his or her courses and placed on a leave of absence for the remainder of the term or withdrawn from the institution completely. Adding and Dropping Courses A student may add and/or drop courses during two distinct add/drop periods: (1) a five-day open period following pre-registration and (2) the first two weeks of fall and spring term and the first three days of January term, with certain limitations and exceptions, as follows: Classes may not be added after the beginning of the second class meeting of any course unless the instructor grants permission. Courses meeting for less than the full term must be registered by the end of the first week of that course's meetings. Senior projects/theses must be registered by the end of the second week of Fall and Spring terms, and the end of the first week of January Term. Independent/directed studies and internships for 3 or 4 credits must be registered by the end of the second week of Fall or Spring terms.

Auditing a Course A student in good academic standing and with the permission of the instructor may audit a course. The student and the instructor must agree in advance on what the auditor is expected to do. At the end of the course, the instructor shall certify that the student met these obligations by issuing a grade of 'AU'. If the obligations are not met, the student will be dropped from the course roster and the course will be removed from the student's record. A decision to change from credit to audit must be made by the end of the first week of the term in which the course is offered. Not all courses are available for audits: studio art, music performance, physical education, computer laboratory, and off-campus programs are excluded. It is the student's responsibility to notify the Office of the Registrar, in writing, when auditing a course. 206 Course Load A full time academic course load is defined as a minimum of 12 credits in Fall and Spring terms and 3 credits in January term. However, a normal course load for a regular full-time student is 30 credits per year, normally distributed as 13-14 credits in the Fall Term, 3-4 credits in the January Term and 13-14 credits in the Spring Term. Regular full-time matriculated students are expected to complete at least a 30 credit load for the academic year as they work toward the total of 120 academic credits, plus two physical education credits and one WICK-101 credit required for graduation over a four- year period. Students that fail to meet credit completion requirements established by the Academic Standard of Progress policy are subject to academic dismissal. Students enrolled in the Three Year Bachelor's Degree Program are expected to complete at least 40 academic credits per year to graduate with 120 academic credits, two physical education credits and one WICK-101 credit in three years. Course Overload A student with a current cumulative grade point average of 2.00 or higher and no outstanding incompletes may register for up to 20 academic credits in Fall and Spring term and 4 academic credits in January Term. A student may register for up to 5 credits in January term without petitioning if the 5th credit is Physical Education. If a student wishes to register for more credits than are permitted, he or she must petition the Committee on Academic Standards for permission. Any credit registered above the limit will be charged a per credit over-election fee, including the 5th credit in January term. Course Withdrawal Following the add/drop period at the start of each term, a student may withdraw from a full term course through the ninth week of fall and spring term and the third week of January term. For fall and spring term first or second half courses, a student may withdraw through the end of the fifth week of the course. A grade of 'W' is issued for all course withdrawals. A student who withdraws from one or more courses may need to repay any state financial aid received. See \"Standards of NYS Student Aid Eligibility\" under Educational Policies and Procedures. A student who wishes to withdraw from a course must notify the Registrar's Office, in writing, by the deadline. Independent and Directed Studies Students wishing to engage in a study for which no course exists but in an area in which an instructor is qualified, may pursue either an independent or directed study pursuant to the following restrictions. Credit for an independent or directed study may be 1, 2, 3, or 4 credits. Independent Studies permit junior and senior students with a GPA of 2.3 or higher to examine specialized topics with minimal supervision. To qualify for an independent study, a student must have prior academic experience (either a completed course or directed study with at least a C for each course) in the general field or fields in which the study is to be undertaken. Departmental approval shall come only after a formal departmental review and concurrence that the proposal has sound academic merit. To assist in this process, the student must provide a list of the courses that qualify the student for pursuing such a project, a detailed explanation of the goals of the project, and a detailed listing of available resources. Justified exceptions to this policy can be brought to the Committee on Academic Standards for decision. The following course numbers will be used to indicate independent studies: 398 for Junior Independent Studies 498 for Senior Independent Studies Directed Studies are open to all students in good academic standing except first semester freshman. In such projects the student works closely with the instructor on an individual basis. The instructor will provide evaluations and guidance at least one hour per week during the tenure of the project. Departmental approval shall follow the same formula as that for independent studies. The following course numbers will be used to indicate directed studies: 199 for Second Semester Freshmen Directed Studies 299 for Sophomore Directed Studies 399 for Junior Directed Studies 499 for Senior Directed Studies 207 A student may take no more than two independent and four directed studies during a four-year career and no more than two independent and two directed studies during a two-year career. No more than four studies of any combination with the above guidelines may be taken with the same instructor unless the Committee on Academic Standards grants special permission. Registration deadlines are listed with the Adding/Dropping Courses policy elsewhere in the catalog. Registration forms are available from the Office of the Registrar. Completed forms, including departmental approval, must be on file in the Office of the Registrar. Internships An internship is an integrative experience applying academic study with hands-on learning in a professional setting. The pre- professional learning outcomes include job-specific skill development, career awareness, personal development and professionalism. Academic learning outcomes are set by the department through which the internship is registered. Students can gain up to 12 credits, during their time at Hartwick, in increments of 1-6 credits per internship. For every credit given, a student must work 40 hours at the internship. Academic work is also assigned, at the discretion of the faculty supervisor. Students must register for credit before the internship. Any students who wish to seek credit after completion of the internship must complete a Learning Agreement and petition the Committee on Academic Standards for approval. The following course numbers are used for internships: 195 Freshman 295 Sophomore 395 Junior 495 Senior Registration for an internship establishes the same commitment as registering for a course and therefore follow a similar add/drop and withdrawal schedule, unless an exception is granted by the Internship Coordinator and the Registrar. Information on the Learning Agreement, and a link to the Agreement, can be found in the Career Services section of the Hartwick website. Students can secure an internship on their own or they can use the tools offered by Career Services. Securing an internship often involves providing an employer with a cover letter and resume and possibly participating in an interview. While many internships are unpaid, students can be paid (hourly or stipend) for an internship and gain credit. Note that commission- based opportunities are not considered internships. It is highly suggested that internships take place on-site, however, consideration will be given to virtual or project-based internships. The Learning Agreement must clearly outline the roles and responsibilities of the intern and the method of communication and supervision of the Site Supervisor. These internships must be approved by the Internship Advisor, in consultation with the Director of Career Services. The following roles support the student during the internship process: The Faculty Supervisor- must be a full-time professor and anticipated to be on campus during the term of the internship and not on sabbatical. Credit is issued by the faculty supervisor's department and the internship must be approved by that department's chair before the internship is registered. The Site Supervisor is someone in a professional position (e.g. a volunteer coordinator, office manager, archivist, etc.) at the internship site who is able to make commitments on behalf of the organization and who will work closely with the student intern as well as College staff/faculty during the course of the internship, providing sound, professional judgment and mentoring in the skill areas assigned. The Site Supervisor provides on-site training, assigns job duties and supervises the work of the student intern. The Site Supervisor must be present during the student's internship hours, or ensure that another staff person will be responsible for the student's supervision during the Site Supervisor's absence. Internship Advisor-is a Hartwick Career Services staff member who serves as a liaison between the student intern, the faculty supervisor and the site supervisor. The Internship Advisor, under the guidance of the Director of Career Services approves or denies any Learning Agreements, ensures the internship is registered for credit and supports the student during the internshi p process. Supervision of the intern is the joint responsibility of the Faculty Supervisor and the Site Supervisor. The Internship Advisor serves as a secondary support during the internship. The Career Services office reserves the right to deny approval or revoke an approved site and their internship opportunity should they feel, at any time, that the professional qualifications of the site supervisor are not sufficient or the internship does not provide learning experiences at a professional level. Student feedback for sites and site supervisors is collected every semester and a review of sites is made as conditions warrant. Conflict of interest 208 In the best interest of the student, the following is considered when a student is determining an appropriate site supervisor for an internship. To avoid impropriety and conflict of interest, the Site Supervisor and the Faculty Supervisor cannot be the same person. The Site Supervisor can't be someone related, by blood or marriage, to the student intern. The Faculty Supervisor can't have a stake (business or professional connection) in the internship project or site, or have an affiliated relationship that constitutes a conflict that could compromise the objectivity of the internship evaluation. Career Services will not approve Learning Agreements in such cases. Non-Credit Study In order to provide special educational experiences for individuals in our community, Hartwick offers the opportunity to enroll in many regular courses on a non-credit basis at a very modest cost, provided there are openings in the courses after the pre-registration period has ended. Non-credit courses are not recorded by the Registrar's Office, and no grades are issued. Such study cannot be applied toward a degree at Hartwick or any other institution. Not all courses at the college may be taken for non-credit. Classes in studio art, music performance, computer science and off-campus courses and programs are not eligible. All pre-requisites or other restrictions on courses apply to non-credit enrollments. For each non- credit enrollment, the approval of the instructor teaching the course is required. Registration as a non-credit student entitles you to classroom attendance only. Charges must be paid at the Student Accounts office before the beginning of each course. Check with the Student Accounts office for a current fee schedule. Persons 62 years of age or older are eligible for a Senior Citizen Fee Waiver and may enroll at no charge. Pre-Registration All enrolled students are required to pre-register for courses in order to maintain their standing as actively enrolled students. Failure to pre-register by the appropriate deadline may affect a student's standing with the institution. Each student is responsible for his or her own pre-registration and must be cleared by an advisor in order to pre-register for courses. Each student is assigned a pre-registration date and time by the Registrar's Office based on his or her Anticipated Completion Date with the exception of Three Year Degree, Nursing, Education and College Honors (these students are assigned a higher priority in their respective class year). Students pre- register for January and spring term courses the preceding November following fall break, and fall term courses the preceding April following spring break. All students pre-register themselves and make changes to their course schedules online. Senior Thesis/Project, Independent/Directed Studies and courses requiring instructor permission cannot be registered online and must be registered in writing, using the appropriate form, in the Registrar's Office. Pre-registration requests submitted through email will not be processed. Repeating a Course A student may retake any course for the purpose of gaining additional knowledge and improving the grade. Retaking a course for which the student has credit (the course was passed) will not add to the student's total number of credits completed for graduation. For courses repeated at Hartwick, the higher grade will be used to calculate the grade point average. For courses repeated elsewhere, if the course is allowed to transfer in, and if the Hartwick grade in the earlier attempt was C- or lower, the Hartwick grade will not be included in the student's grade point average. The transfer grade will not be used in the grade point average either; the student will just have credit for the transfer course rather than the Hartwick course. In either case, the course being repeated remains on the transcript. Repeating a course in which a student earned a letter grade other than 'F' may impact a student's state and/or federal aid. A student repeating a course should check with the Office of Student Accounts or Financial Aid before choosing to repeat a course. It is the student's responsibility to notify the Office of the Registrar, in writing, when a course is being repeated. SUNY Oneonta Exchange Program Through a cooperative arrangement student from Hartwick College or the SUNY Oneonta may enroll in courses on the other campus without paying tuition and the comprehensive fee. The program is coordinated through the Registrars' Offices at Hartwick and SUNY Oneonta. The following guidelines govern registration: 1. Hartwick students must be matriculated and enrolled full-time in Fall or Spring (12 credits) at Hartwick before registering for a SUNY Oneonta course. 2. Hartwick students may take only one course per academic term at SUNY Oneonta. 209 3. Hartwick students may not register at SUNY Oneonta for a course available on their own campus, even if that course is not offered in the present term. (There may be an exception for a student whose graduation plans may have to be postponed.) 4. Hartwick students may consult SUNY Oneonta's schedule of classes on-line to select a course and find instructor contact information. When a student selects a course and receives permission from the instructor to enroll, the Registrar's Office will contact SUNY Oneonta, after their students have registered, to see if an opening exists. If so, the registration will be made. This Exchange Program is not available in January or during the summer. The letter grade earned at SUNY Oneonta through this program will be calculated in Hartwick grade point average. Courses cannot be taken as pass/fail. 210 Academic Credit Policies Advanced Placement Credit Hartwick College offers advanced placement credit for most scores of three or better on the Advanced Placement Exams of the College Board. Several Advanced Placement tests have been designated by academic programs as equivalent to one or more Hartwick courses. If an Advanced Placement test is not designated equivalent to a Hartwick course or courses, credits toward the general education curriculum or elective credit may still be offered. AP transcripts must be submitted to the Office of the Registrar so that credit may be awarded. The following equivalencies are subject to change as periodic reviews of placement exams and credit policies are conducted.

FL = foreign language, QFR = quantitative and formal reasoning. Elective credit = credit not applied to specific general education requirement but does count toward the overall 120 academic credits required for graduation. **Students with AP credit must still take BIOL101. For a BIOL score of 4 or better, 202 OR 203 are WAIVED if an A is achieved in BIOL 101. A-Level and AS Level Exams Hartwick awards credit for Advanced Level and Advanced Level Subsidiary Exams. In general, up to 6 academic credits will be granted for each A-level exam with a passing grade. Up to 3 academic credits will be granted for each AS-level exam with a passing grade. No more than 30 academic credits from all A-level and AS-level exams may be applied to a Hartwick degree. Liberal Arts in Practice divisional and general elective credits will be awarded for each exam. Credit is not directly awarded for specific Hartwick courses unless approved by an academic department Chair. 212 No grades are posted for A-level or AS-level credit awards. Advanced credit policies are reviewed on a regular basis and are subject to change without notice. College Level Examination Program (CLEP) Credit is offered through the College Level Examination Program (CLEP) under specified conditions for students who have acquired mastery of a subject through experience or other avenues outside the traditional classroom setting. Approval of a particular exam for credit must be confirmed, in writing, by the Registrar, using the Request for Non-Hartwick Course Approval form. Approval must be obtained prior to completion of a CLEP exam. Credit is only awarded for subject exams, not for general exams. Equivalencies are subject to change as periodic reviews of exams and credit policies are conducted. Hartwick adheres to ACE scoring guidelines for awarding of credit. Click here to read more. Credit for Prior Experiential Learning Prior experiential learning is learning acquired outside of a formal academic setting. It provides knowledge, understanding, or intellectual skills expected of students who pursue a baccalaureate degree at a liberal arts and sciences college and takes place prior to admission. Prior experiential learning usually results from independent reading or study from employment, from serving an internship or from some other related activity. To obtain credit for prior experiential learning, students must be able to articulate in some acceptable way what they have learned and must be able to demonstrate that it is equivalent to the academic work done by college students. Credit will only be granted for experiences occurring after the completion of high school. Students who have been accepted for admission by the College and who desire credit for prior experiential learning must submit an application (available in the Office of the Registrar) to the Chair of the department in which credit is being sought. The Department Chair shall evaluate the application or submit it to other academic departments or to the appropriate faculty committee for further evaluation. The evaluation will include a personal interview and whatever form of demonstration is necessary to determine whether academic credit (without grades) should be awarded. If the application is approved, it will be forwarded to the Office of the Registrar for final approval by the Registrar and processing and to the Office of Student Accounts for collection of the Experiential Credit award fee. If approved, the experiential credit is added to the student's record with a grade of 'CR'. No more than 30 credits for prior experiential learning may be included in credits required for graduation. No more than 60 credits earned through the combination of transfer credit, equivalency examinations and prior experiential learning may be applied toward a Hartwick degree. Credit for College Courses Transfer credit from nationally and regionally accredited colleges is given for courses substantially similar to those offered at Hartwick College, completed with a grade of C or higher, or the equivalent. A student may only transfer in 75 credits toward a Hartwick College degree with the exception of students enrolled in the Nursing Partnership Program (PNOP) who may transfer in up to 90. Grades for courses taken elsewhere are included when determining a student's eligibility for honors at Commencement but are not posted on the transcript. A grade of 'CR' (credit) is entered for all transfer courses. Credit earned for transfer courses is posted on the student's transcript and counts toward the overall number of academic credits required for graduation. The Office of the Registrar is responsible for evaluating all transfer credit for new and current students, and the final decision on whether or not to allow a course to transfer lies with the Registrar. Hartwick accepts Mathematics credit for transfer courses below the pre-calculus level but does not count those courses (like algebra) toward the Liberal Arts in Practice curriculum. Hartwick does not count transfer courses towards the Writing Requirement (e.g. a Composition Course completed at another institution cannot be used to satisfy ENGL 110 Composition at Hartwick). Courses that are too technical in nature or too dissimilar from courses at Hartwick, like courses for Electrical Engineering or Microsoft Excel for Budgeting, are not eligible for transfer. As previously stated, courses must be similar to those offered at Hartwick to be eligible for transfer. 213 Hartwick College generally will honor the associate of arts or associate of science degree from accredited colleges by offering the equivalent of two years of credit. Associate degree candidates who are admitted must meet the Hartwick College graduation requirements; it is possible that this may take longer than two years in some cases. Courses Taken Elsewhere by Current Students Any course a student wishes to transfer after he or she has matriculated must be approved by the Registrar. A course intended to count toward a declared major must also be approved by the Chair of the Department in which the credit will apply (these courses must also be approved by the Registrar, however). A course intended to count toward the Liberal Arts in Practice (LAiP) general education curriculum or as an elective must be approved by the Registrar. Approval by a Department Chair is not required for LAiP or elective courses. All requests for course approval must be submitted to the Office of the Registrar using the Non-Hartwick Course Approval form. Incomplete forms will not be accepted. After submission to the Office of the Registrar please allow a minimum of two business days for a decision. Process for Requesting Transfer Credit Approval - Current Students 1. Select courses that will transfer to major, as LAiP requirements or as electives. Do so by finding courses that are similar t o those offered at Hartwick. 2. Obtain a Non-Hartwick Course Approval form (available online or in the Registrar's Office). Fill out the form completely and attach detailed course descriptions. 3. Obtain signatures for courses in the major. 4. Return the completed form to the Registrar's Office. 5. Wait two business days for a decision. When a copy of the approved form is received, check to see that ALL courses have been approved. If a course has not been approved, credit will not be awarded for it. 6. If a course was not approved, select another and follow the steps above. Transfer Credit Approval Process for New Students New or incoming students must submit transcripts of courses completed, showing final grades, to the Office of Admissions. Once Admissions receives the transcripts they will be sent to a Transfer Credit Evaluator for review. The Transfer Credit Evaluator will determine which courses are eligible for transfer and contact the student with a final transfer credit equivalency report showing how the transfer credit will apply to the Hartwick degree within five business days. The Transfer Credit Evaluator may contact the student if he or she requires more information to determine how to apply specific courses to the degree program (this is usually accomplished by requesting a course description). International Baccalaureate (IB) Hartwick recognizes the International Baccalaureate Diploma for purposes of admission. Course credit will be granted for most higher-level (HL) and standard-level (SL) subjects with grades of 4 or better. Equivalencies are subject to change as periodic reviews of exams and credit policies are conducted. Below is a listing of IB courses with Hartwick equivalencies.

If after this conversation the faculty member has found evidence that the student has knowingly or with culpabl e negligence committed an act of academic dishonesty, he or she shall first so inform the student and then file a formal charge with the Office of Academic Affairs. In addition to a written explanation of the charge, the faculty member will provide the evidence that substantiates it to the academic honesty officer. Other members of the college community \u2014 staff or students \u2014 who become aware of dishonest behavior as defined above should consult with the academic honesty officer about whether and/or how to press charges. When the Office of Academic Affairs has received the formal charge from the faculty member, the academic honesty officer will schedule a meeting with the student and discuss both the charge and the evidence. If the academic honesty officer concurs that the student has committed the offense, he or she shall inform the student of the penalty in writing. Academic Residency Requirement A student must complete the last 30 semester hours of the courses required for graduation while in residence at Hartwick. Residenc e means enrollment in programs conducted by the College on or off campus. Any student wishing to complete courses elsewhere while in residence must petition the Committee on Academic Standards for a waiver of residency. Academic Standards of Progress The maintenance of good academic standing requires students to meet minimum standards for cumulative Grade Point Average (GPA), term GPA*, and total credits as defined below. Failure to meet these standards results in academic dismissal (AD) or academic probation (AP). Standards for Cumulative GPA and Total Credits: *By term, we mean either fall or spring semester. J Term credits are included in the Spring Term credit calculations but not the Spring Term GPA. Academic Dismissal Appeal Any student who has been academically dismissed from the College has the right to petition the Committee on Academic Standards to reconsider its decision. Such a request must contain all pertinent information and the information must have a bearing on the student's poor academic performance. The petition should be directed to the Chair of the Committee on Academic Standards, setting forth clearly all arguments for reconsideration and must be submitted within ten calendar days after the date of the Committee's written notification of dismissal. Decisions on such appeals by the Committee on Academic Standards shall be considered final. If a student believes that the aforementioned procedure has not been followed or if the student's Hartwick College academic record has materially changed since the Committee made its final decision, then the student may address his/her concerns to the Dean of Academic Affairs, who may then refer the case back to the Committee for reconsideration. Any student who successfully appeals and is retained from an academic dismissal will automatically be placed on close scrutiny probation (an organized and systematic set of Term* Grade Point Average/Credits Completed Sanction First Term 0.000-1.399 Academic Dismissal First Term 1.400-1.999 Academic Probation First Term Completion of fewer than 6 academic credits Academic Dismissal Second Term 0.000-1.599 Academic Dismissal Second Term 1.600-1.999 Academic Probation Second Term Completion of fewer than 18 academic credits Academic Dismissal Third Term 0.000-1.799 Academic Dismissal Third Term 1.800-1.999 Academic Probation Fourth Term Completion of fewer than 42 academic credits Academic Dismissal Fourth Term and Beyond 0.000-1.999 Academic Dismissal Second Term Juniors Completion of fewer than 70 academic credits Academic Dismissal Second Term Seniors Completion of fewer than 95 academic credits Academic Dismissal Tenth Term and Beyond Completion of fewer than 120 academic credits Academic Dismissal 216 programs specifically targeted at providing remediation as well as social and emotional support to assist the student in succeeding at Hartwick College). After a period of one year a student who has been academically dismissed is eligible to apply for readmission through the Office of the Registrar with acceptance decisions subject to approval by CAS. Should an academically dismissed student successfully complete a minimum of nine credit hours at a regionally accredited college or university, and have a GPA of at least 2.5, and have no grade below a C, that student may apply for early readmission with acceptance decisions subject to approval by CAS. Students who have been dismissed and readmitted will be academically dismissed and no longer be eligible for any further readmission should they fall below minimum academic standards a second time . January Term Suspension Any student who has been academically dismissed at the end of fall term will be academically suspended for the subsequent January term, even if a student petitions the Committee on Academic Standards for an appeal of the academic dismissal. If a student does not petition the Committee on Academic Standards for an appeal of an academic dismissal or if an appeal is denied, he or she will not be suspended; instead, the academic dismissal will be issued after the last date of the fall term in which the academic dismissal was rendered. Even if a student successfully petitions the Committee on Academic Standards for an appeal of an academic dismissal, he or she will be suspended for January term and will be allowed to resume study at Hartwick College the subsequent spring term. Academic Probation Students on probation are required to sign an agreement with the Committee on Academic Standards and with the Registrar that demonstrates their seriousness of purpose and provides a specific plan for repairing their deficiencies in a mutually agreeable time. Failure to comply with the terms of the probation agreement will result in dismissal. As part of academic probation, the Committee may require a student to meet special conditions to continue at the College. Some of the conditions that may be recommended include the following: 1. Student must complete a full load of credits with specified minimum GPA or student must restrict the number of credits to be taken and plan on taking more than the normal time to complete a degree. 2. A change of major. 3. Student must consult or report to specified advisors, mentors, and counselors weekly and/or attend programs or workshops. 4. Student must give up or reduce time-consuming activities such as athletics, fraternity or sorority offices, Hilltops, jobs off campus, theatre, or other co-curricular activities. Probation programs are administered by the Center for Student Success. A student on close scrutiny probation may be academically dismissed at any time during the term in which the student is on probation if there is evidence to show that he or she is not progressing academically. The Committee on Academic Standards will consider adherence to conditions of probation in its evaluation of a student's academic progress. Standards for Term GPA Any student who has a cumulative GPA above 2.0 but has one term with a term GPA below 2.0 is placed on academic probation. An y student who has a cumulative GPA above 2.0 but two consecutive terms with a term GPA below 2.0 is subject to academic dismissal. Athletic Eligibility Hartwick College maintains NCAA membership in both Division I (men's soccer and women's water polo) and Division III (other sports). Student-athletes must comply with the appropriate divisional eligibility requirements necessary to establish and maintain continuous athletics eligibility for practice and/or competition. Eligibility records are maintained in the Athletics Compliance Office located in the Binder Physical Education Center, Room 103. Any student-athlete who falls below a 2.0 term or cumulative GPA and/or is enrolled in less than a minimum full-time course load (12 semester hours per term) must make an appointment with the College's Athletics Compliance Officer regarding their athletics eligibility status for practice and/or competition. In order for Division III student-athletes to maintain continuous athletic eligibility beyond the first year, a student athlete must register for and pass a minimum of 24 credits prior to the beginning of each academic year or have passed 24 credits during the two terms previous to competition. January Term courses and approved courses taken during summer sessions may be counted toward the compilation of courses needed to fulfill this requirement. A student athlete must remain a full-time student (must be enrolled in a minimum of 12 credits for the Fall and Spring terms). Repeating a course for which a passing grade was issued does not count toward the required number of credits for 217 that term or for the academic year. Incomplete courses do not apply toward the required number of credits for that term or for the academic year until all course work has been completed and a passing grade issued. Student-athletes participating in either of the College's NCAA Division I sports (men's soccer and women's water polo) must meet NCAA Division I minimum term and academic year eligibility requirements for practice and/or competition. Questions regarding initial eligibility (academic and amateur certification through the NCAA Eligibility Center required) and maintaining continuous athletic s eligibility at the Division I level should be directed to the College's Athletics Compliance Officer. All student-athletes must also maintain good academic standing. The Committee on Academic Standards may curtail or suspend athletic participation for student-athletes with a cumulative GPA below 2.0. Student-athletes are held accountable for meeting all institutional (Academic Standards of Progress) and NCAA requirements relative to academics and athletics eligibility. Dismissal or suspension from the College for academic or disciplinary reasons may result in an interruption of continuous athletic eligibility per institutional and NCAA regulations. NCAA eligibility requirements are subject to change. The above statements are intended as a general guide. All specific questions should be directed to the College's Athletics Compliance Officer. Catalog Year Changes A student is normally required to graduate under the provisions of the college catalog in effect at the time of matriculation or since the student began continuous enrollment at Hartwick. Continuous enrollment is defined as being enrolled in classes without a break of two or more consecutive regular semesters. However, in certain circumstance, a student may change his or her major catalog year at the discretion of the Registrar or the department in which a student is pursuing a major. A student must indicate this change in writing to the Office of the Registrar when changing a major. If a student does not indicate catalog year when changing a major, his or her catalog year will be retained based on matriculation year. A student should consult with his or her advisor before modifying a catalog year. Students must use a single catalog and not a combination of catalogs for graduation. In cases when required courses are no longer taught by the college, the appropriate academic department may designate a reasonable substitute. Change of Name and/or Address Current students who change their permanent home address are expected to complete a request in writing and submit it to the Office of the Registrar. Students who have moved and who have not submitted a change of address in writing are not exempt from the consequences of failing to receive official College notices and communications. Delays in notifying the Office of the Registrar of address changes may cause delays in the handling of student records and in notifying students in cases of emergency. Note that official College correspondence is mailed to the permanent home address of record for current students. Students that have not yet matriculated must contact the Office of Admissions to change the permanent home address. Students that have graduated must contact the Office of Institutional Advancement to change the permanent home address. A legal name change must be accompanied by a copy of a legal document authorizing the change when submitting a request in writing. Once a legal change of name occurs due to marriage, divorce, or other reasons, an information change form should be promptly filed with the Office of the Registrar. A student may also request a change in preferred name if a legal name change is not warranted. Changing the preferred name does not require the same legal documentation - in fact, a student need only submit the request to the Office of the Registrar in writing and, as long as the preferred name is not for purposes of misrepresentation, it will be changed. In addition, students may also indicate a preferred name prefix (Mr., Ms., Miss, etc.). Once a preferred name is changed, it will be reflected on all class and grade rosters. Note that the legal name of record will still be used on official transcripts, federal and state financial aid reports, enrollment verifications, payroll, and other legally binding documents. Further descriptions of the type of required documentation, by reason, are as follows: Divorce A student who wishes to change a name because of divorce must present a court order as evidence that the divorce decree has been granted. A woman may resume her maiden name after divorce only if such change has been authorized by the court. 218 Immigrant Students These students may not change to names which do not appear on their passports. Thus, a passport is sufficient documentation for a name change. All Others All other students are permitted to change their names without court order by completing a change of information form and presenting proper verification of the new name. This verification must be one of the following pieces of identification showing that a new name has been legally adopted by the student. Driver's License DMV Identification Card Marriage Certificate Passport Legal Court Document Birth Certificate Alien Registration Card This proof is required for all changes, even if the student is adding or dropping one of the following: I, II, III, IV, Jr., Sr. or some other suffix to the name Middle name or initial Hyphen (Clearwater to Clear-Water) A student or former student who has received a bachelor's degree from the College may not have the name changed on that portion of the record preceding the award of any such degree without presenting a court order and paying a processing fee for the printing and mailing of the replacement diploma bearing the new name. New students should contact the Office of Admissions to process any relevant name changes prior to matriculation. Change of Grade Once a final grade has been submitted to and verified by the Office of the Registrar, it cannot be changed without authorization from the Committee on Academic Standards. The student is responsible for requesting a grade change from an instructor within 15 days of grade verification. If a grade change is warranted, the instructor of record must submit a Grade Change Request to the Office of the Registrar for consideration by the Committee on Academic Standards. Notice of the Committee's decision is sent, in writing, to the student and instructor. No grade changes are permitted after a student graduates. Class Absences Policy At Hartwick, students are responsible for regular class attendance and are accountable for all work missed because of class absences . Instructors normally list attendance policies on course syllabi that are distributed at the beginning of the term. Students should be aware that in some classes there are no excused absences for any reason. Instructors may request students to provide reasons for absences and are under no obligation to make special arrangements for students who are absent. Students are expected to communicate directly with instructors regarding absences except in the following instances: Illness : Faculty will be notified by the Perrella Wellness Center if a student is admitted to a hospital facility. When a student returns home without prior consultation with the Director of the Perrella Wellness Center, documentation from the attending physician must be received prior to notification of faculty. Absences for illness that does not require admittance to a medical facility are to be reported by the student directly to the instructor who may or may not count them as excused. Medical Leave : Faculty will be notified by the Perrella Wellness Center if a student is granted a medical leave. Death : Faculty will be notified by the Office of Student Affairs if a student is away due to the death of a family member (parent, sibling, grandparent). The student or a member of the family should report this information to the vice president of student affairs prior to departure from campus. General Leave : Advisors will be notified by the Office of the Registrar if a student is granted a general leave. 219 Other than medical or general leaves, whether or not absences are excused is at the discretion of the faculty member. As noted above, there are some classes where attendance is so critical that it may not be possible to remain in the course even though the absences are legitimate and excused. Observance of Religious Holidays (as provided in the New York State Education Law Section 224- A): Students who are compelled for religious reasons to be absent on a particular day for registration, class or an examination will be excused and given an equivalent opportunity to make up the requirements, provided that the student notifies the Instructor (or the Office of Academic Affairs) as soon as the student becomes aware of the conflict and no later than one week prior to the absence. Classification of Students Freshman-fewer than 30 academic credits completed Sophomore-30 through 59 academic credits completed Junior-60 through 89 academic credits completed Senior-minimum of 90 academic credits completed College Honors To complete the Honors Program, and to be recommended by the Honors Program Committee for College Honors upon graduation, a student must be admitted to the program and successfully complete all Honors Program requirements. Each student must graduate with at least a 3.5 cumulative grade point average to receive College Honors. Successful completion of the College Honors Program is designated on the student's transcript. Commencement Participation Students may participate in the May commencement ceremony if they are registered in the Spring Term of their senior year for an approved program of studies, which, if completed with suitable grades, will fulfill all degree requirements. Students completing all degree requirements in December or February of a given academic year may participate in the May ceremony of that academic year, but must notify the Registrar in writing of their intent to do so. Students that have fifteen (15) credit hours or fewer remaining toward completion of their degree(s) may request permission from the Registrar to participate in the May commencement. A student may only participate in one commencement ceremony. Students that complete all degree requirements in September (e.g. finish over the summer) are eligible to participate in the previous May ceremony, but must submit an application for graduation to the Office of the Registrar indicating their intent. Course Cancellation The college does not guarantee offering all or any of the courses listed in the college catalog. When there is inadequate registration for a course (generally less than 8 students), it may be cancelled without notice. The Registrar and/or Department Chair will notify all affected students of course cancellations before the first meeting of the course by email and in writing to the student's campus mailbox. Dean's List To be eligible for a Fall Term or Spring Term Dean's List, a student must complete within that term at least 12 academic credits, earning a term grade point average of at least 3.5. Any student with a grade of Incomplete in any course in that term other than Senior Project/Thesis is not eligible for Dean's List. Dean's List is issued only at the end of Fall and Spring terms (not for summer sessions or January Term - note that January Term grades/credits are not included for Spring Term Dean's List eligibility). Deletion of Courses from Final Grade Point Average In order to meet the minimum 2.00 cumulative and major grade point averages required for graduation, a senior may elect during his or her final term to exclude from the final cumulative grade point average any course not needed to meet graduation requirements (including total number of academic credits). Such grades will still be shown on the transcript but will not be calculated within the final cumulative grade point average. Such requests must be submitted, in writing, to the Registrar. If a student does not meet the minimum grade point average for a major, he or she must make arrangements with the Chair of his or her department to achieve a 2.000 and must communicate the arrangement, in writing, to the Registrar. A notation appears next to each excluded course on the student's transcript. 220 Departmental Distinction Students are awarded Departmental Distinction upon completion of a degree if they have met all of the following requirements: 1. Earned a cumulative grade point average of at least 3.3; 2. Earned a grade point average of at least 3.5 in the major; 3. Completed a departmental capstone with a grade of at least A-; 4. Met any other requirements as specified in the Hartwick College Catalog by individual departments. Each department will indicate in the College Catalog which courses either within or outside the department count toward requirement two above. Notice of Departmental Distinction is entered on a student's permanent record and appears on the transcript. Individual Student Program Distinction A student who, at the time of graduation, has met the following standards may be awarded a degree with Individual Student Program Distinction upon recommendation of the Interdisciplinary Studies Committee and with the approval of the Committee on Academic Standards: 1. Has the approval of the Program Advisor and Advisory Committee; 2. Has earned an overall GPA of 3.5 or higher in the courses constituting the area of concentration; 3. Completed a senior project with a grade of at least A-; and 4. Has earned a cumulative average of at least 3.0. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA) The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act and its implementing regulations, as amended (collectively, FERPA), afford students certain rights with respect to their education records. The right to inspect and review the student's educational records within a reasonable time, not to exceed 45 days, of the day the college receives his/her request for access. Students should submit to the registrar, dean, head of the academic department, or other appropriate official, written requests that identify the record(s) they wish to inspect. The college official will make arrangements for access and notify the student of the time and the place where the records may be inspected. If the records are not maintained by the college official to whom the request was submitted, that official will advise the student of the correct official to whom the request should be addressed. The right to request the amendment of the student's educational records that the student believes to be inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise in violation of the student's privacy rights. A student seeking amendment of his/her education record should write the college official responsible for the record, clearly identify the part of the record he/she wants changed, and specify why it is inaccurate, misleading or otherwise in violation of his/her privacy rights. If the college decides not to amend the record as requested by the student, the college will notify the student of the decision and advise the student of his/her right to a hearing regarding the request for amendment. Additional information regarding the hearing procedures will be provided to the student when he/she requests a hearing, or otherwise upon request. If the hearing results in a final determination not to amend the record, the student is permitted to place a statement with the record commenting on the contested information, stating his/her disagreement with the decision not to amend the record, or both. The right to consent to disclosure of personally identifiable information contained in the student's educational records, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent. Set forth below is information about circumstances in which FERPA authorizes such disclosures. The college reserves the right to make disclosures of information from education records without a student's consent in these and other circumstances in which such disclosures are permitted by FERPA. o One exception which permits disclosures without consent is disclosure to school officials with legitimate educational interests. A school official is a person employed by the university in an administrative, supervisory, academic or research or support staff position (including law enforcement unit personnel and health staff); a person or company with whom the university has contracted (such as an attorney, auditor, or collection agent); a person serving on the Board of Trustees; a student serving on an official committee, such as a disciplinary or grievance committee, or assisting another school official in performing his/her tasks; or a person volunteering or otherwise performing services for the College. A school official has a legitimate educational interest if the official needs to review an education record in order to fulfill his/her responsibilities to the university. 221 o Another exception permits the University to disclose a student's education records without consent to officials of another university, college or school in which a student seeks or intends to enroll, or is already enrolled, for purposes of the student's enrollment or transfer. o Another exception permits the disclosure of \"directory information\" without a student's consent unless the student has followed the steps described below. \"Directory information\" includes the student's name, class year, address, telephone listing, e-mail address, date and place of birth, enrollment status (e.g., undergraduate or graduate, full-time or part-time), major field of study, identification number, participation in officially recognized activities and sports, weight and height of members of athletic teams, photographs or other visual images, dates of attendance, degrees and awards received, the most previous educational agency or institution attended by the student, and other information that would not generally be considered harmful or an invasion of privacy if disclosed. o A student has the right to withhold the public release of any or all directory information directly pertaining to him/her by giving reasonable advance written notice to the Registrar by the end of the second week of classes. The right to file a complaint concerning alleged failures by the College to comply with the requirements of FERPA. Any questions or concerns pertaining to Hartwick's compliance with FERPA should be referred to the Office of the Registrar. The Registrar will promptly review all such allegations and initiate appropriate actions. In addition, complaints regarding alleged violations by the university of FERPA may be submitted to: Family Policy Compliance Office U.S. Dept. of Education 400 Maryland Avenue SW Washington, D.C. 20202-5920 Additional information on FERPA, including specific Hartwick College policies and definitions, is found here. Final Grade Reports Final grades are reported electronically at the end of each term. Hartwick College does not mail official grade reports to a student's permanent home address unless instructed, in writing, by the student. Such requests must be made to the Office of the Registrar and are in effect until rescinded by the student. Full- and Part-Time Student Status A matriculated student is one accepted by the College to work full- or part-time toward a degree. A full-time matriculated student is expected to comply with the Credit Load policy listed elsewhere in the catalog. All matriculated students must abide by the regulations established by the faculty and enforced by the Chief Academic Officer and the Committee on Academic Standards. All matriculated degree seeking students must provide evidence of high school (or equivalent) completion in order to matriculate into a degree program (Hartwick requires an official high school transcript for this purpose). In addition to a high school transcript, all degree seeking transfer students must provide evidence of matriculation at all previously attended post-secondary institutions by submitting official transcripts from those institutions. Since Hartwick is designed primarily as a residential institution for full-time students, exceptions to the full-time status will be granted only in cases falling within the following categories: Students admitted as part-time matriculated students because of an unusual need. An example would be a student who, for financial reasons, cannot afford full-time status or has a documented medical condition that prevents carrying a full time course load. Students in these or similar circumstances may be admitted as part-time students upon approval of the Director of Admissions and Registrar. Full-time students who wish to change to part-time matriculated status for one or more terms after enrollment at the College for the following reasons : o Continuation of study at the College past the normal four-year period. o Enrollment in a final term requiring only part-time load to complete all degree requirements. o Special, validated health problems permitting part-time, not full-time, study. o Unforeseeable financial emergency. Full-time students wishing to transition to part-time status for the reasons listed above must request approval for part-time status from the Office of the Registrar. Full-time students who wish to transition to part-time status for reasons not listed above must petition the Committee on Academic Standards for approval. Part-time students wishing to transition to full-time status must request approval for full-time status from the Office of the Registrar. 222 Grades Grades are due 48 hours after the last exam or meeting time and are awarded according to the following scale: A: indicates original or independent thinking, a command of the interrelationships within the subject, the ability to apply the principles learned, a mastery of the subject matter and clarity of expression. Grade points per credit: A = 4.0, A- = 3.7. B: indicates a mastery of the subject matter, an understanding of the fundamentals and their interrelationships, the ability to apply that knowledge and to express it clearly. Grade points per credit: B+ = 3.3, B = 3.0, B- = 2.7. C: indicates an acceptable knowledge of the course content, an understanding of the fundamental principles and a reasonable ability to apply them. Grade points per credit: C+ = 2.3, C = 2.0, C- = 1.7. D: indicates minimal knowledge and understanding of the course content, with a limited ability to apply the principles learned. Grade points per credit: D+ = 1.3, D = 1.0, D- = 0.7. F: indicates that the work was not satisfactorily completed. Grade points per credit: F = 0.0. I: at the discretion of the instructor, a grade of incomplete may be issued. An incomplete grade indicates that the coursework was incomplete at the end of the term and that the instructor granted additional time to complete the work or additional time was required for grading practices. It should be understood that incompletes are issued for a number of reasons and do not necessarily indicate negligence on the part of the student and are issued at the discretion of the instructor. For the student to receive credit for the course, all work must be completed by one of the following dates, or by an earlier date as set by the instructor: Spring and Summer Term Courses-October 30. Fall and January term Courses-March 30. If a grade is not submitted by the appropriate date, a grade of \"F\" will be recorded. Note that outstanding incomplete grades are immediately converted to \"F\" upon dismissal or withdrawal from the institution if not resolved prior to the hiatus being issued. The grade of I is not to be awarded in place of a failing grade, to intentionally delay graduation certification or issuance of a hiatus, or when the student is expected to repeat the course; in such cases, a grade other than I must be assigned. A grade of I will only be issued upon submission of an Incomplete Explanation Form to the Office of the Registrar. P: Pass. Indicates that the work was satisfactorily completed. N: Not-Pass. Indicates that the work was not satisfactorily completed. Physical education and Wick 101 courses are graded on a Passed (P), Not Passed (N) basis and do not count toward the 120 academic credits required for a degree. Additional grades: X: indicates non-attendance in a course. The student must show to the satisfaction of the Committee on Academic Standards that he or she never attended the course or stopped attending the course and failed to withdraw with proper administrative processing. \"X\" does not count in the total credits attempted and does not factor in to the grade point average. W: indicates that the student withdrew from the course by the end of the ninth week of the term for a Fall or Spring term course or by the end of the third week for a January Term course. Each instructor must provide every student with an evaluation of progress in the course so that the student may evaluate his or her status prior to the deadline for withdrawal. Withdrawals after the deadline are not permitted unless approved by the Committee on Academic Standards. \"W\" does not count in the total of credits attempted and does not factor in to the grade point average. PND: used when no grade has been submitted by the instructor. The grade is pending. PND grades are used sparingly and only when extenuating circumstances prevent the instructor from issuing a final grade. A letter grade must be submitted by the instructor within one week of being issued or the PND grade will convert to an F. AU: indicates a student has audited a course. In addition to the grades and quality points referred to above, a faculty member may write a commentary concerning the student's work in a class. Such statements must be submitted to the Office of the Registrar in writing; only then will they be incorporated as part of the transcript. Grades receiving comment are indicated with a '*' on the transcript. 223 January Term Participation First year (freshmen) students that matriculate in the fall term are required to register for at least three academic credits in the January Term of their first academic year. Registering for a course in January Term, although not required, is highly recommended for non- first year students. Any student that does not wish to register for a course in January Term must file a leave of absence with the Registrar's Office. A first year student requesting a leave must have it approved by the Registrar. If a student does not file a leave of absence and does not register for a course in January Term, he or she will be withdrawn from the institution in compliance with the policy on Administrative Withdrawal found elsewhere in the catalog. Any student filing a leave of absence for January Term must complete and submit a Request to Return from a Leave of Absence form to the Registrar's Office prior to returning for a future term. Leaves, Withdrawals, and Suspensions Leaves of Absence Students who wish to leave the College for a term, after which they intend to return, must file a written, signed and dated leave of absence request that includes the reason for the leave of absence. If a leave of absence is taken while a student is currently enrolled in classes, that term is considered to be one semester of the leave. A student who leaves campus during a term without filing a leave of absence is considered an unofficial withdrawal. Besides a general leave of absence, students may apply for a leave for medical reasons. The granting of a leave of absence guarantees readmission to the major in which the student is enrolled when applying for a leave and permits the student to graduate by complying with the degree program requirements in effect when the leave is taken. The date of leave is the date when the student notifies the Registrar's Office of an intention to take a leave of absence or the last day of academic activity as determined by the Registrar. Students taking a leave of absence who are recipients of Federal Title IV financial aid should contact the Financial Aid Office to determine the implications of the leave on their financial aid. Students who have on-campus housing when applying for a leave of absence are required to live on campus when they return, unless approved to move off campus by the Office of Residential Life and Housing. Leaves are granted for only one term. While on a leave of absence a student is not permitted to participate in any academic or social activities on campus without special permission from the Vice President for Student Affairs (or designee). Access to course materials via D2L is not possible once a leave has been issued. If a student takes a leave of absence and later is placed on probation, suspended, dismissed or expelled, the sanctions take precedence over the leave of absence and stand as a matter of record. Academic probation becomes operative at the end of the leave. Students on a leave of absence who decide not to return to Hartwick must contact the Registrar's Office to request an officia l withdrawal. The date of separation for the leave of absence will be used as the date of separation for the withdrawal. Students who do not return after the specified leave of absence period and who do not apply for an official withdrawal are considered unofficial withdrawals, and the last day of attendance will be considered the date the leave of absence began. Students withdrawn from the College are required to apply for readmission in order to return. In such instances, there is no guarantee of readmission. Recent changes in federal policy regarding approved leaves of absence require the College to report students who do not return to active enrolled status after one term as withdrawn from the institution. General Leave of Absence A general leave of absence is granted for one term to students who wish to interrupt their studies at Hartwick College. A general leave of absence is also required for students studying in non-affiliated programs or for military reasons. Application for a general leave of absence is managed by the Registrar's Office. If the student is enrolled in classes, taking a leave of absence by the withdrawal deadline date published in the academic calendar results in grades of W (withdrawn) in all courses other than completed courses. Taking a general leave of absence after the last date to withdraw as published in the academic calendar results in grades of F in all courses other than completed courses. The leave of absence allows the student on leave the opportunity to register in advance for the semester of return. Medical Leave of Absence Students who must leave the College because of medical or psychological conditions that necessitate their absence may request a medical leave of absence. 224 Documentation of the serious nature of the medical condition must be provided to the Perrella Wellness Center. Approval must be given by the Director of Perrella Wellness Center (in consultation with the Director of Counseling when it is a psychological condition). Application forms for medical leaves of absence are available at the Perrella Wellness Center. When a medical leave of absence is granted during the course of the term, the course grade is normally a W (withdrawn) in all courses, other than completed courses, unless the student initiates and receives appropriate approval for an incomplete (I) from an instructor within five business days of the date the leave is issued. The Registrar's Office must be notified within the five business day period, in writing, from the instructor, if a grade of incomplete (I) will be issued. If a grade of I is issued, a student must remove it by the first published incomplete grade expiration deadline after their return. If the grade is not removed within the time allowed, it will convert to F. Applications for medical leave must be submitted by the last date to withdraw from courses as published in the academic calendar. Applications submitted after the withdrawal deadline date will not be considered, except in extraordinary circumstances. In such circumstances, additional documentation and information may be required, and the decision will involve input from the Vice President of Student Affairs. A student must be cleared through the Perrella Wellness Center before returning from a medical leave of absence. Documentatio n must be submitted to the Perrella Wellness Center indicating that the medical or psychological condition has been remedied and that the student is capable of resuming study at the College. All information submitted becomes part of the student's health record and will remain confidential. Students on medical leave are not eligible to register for courses until approved to return from medical leave. Administrative Leave of Absence (effective July 1, 2014) This policy is meant to be invoked only in extraordinary circumstances, when a student is unable or unwilling to request a leave of absence or official withdrawal when such a hiatus may be necessary to protect the safety of that student and/or others, or the integrity of the College's learning environment. Before an administrative leave is issued, every effort will be made to encourage the student to take a voluntary leave or withdrawal. Administrative leaves can be issued within or prior to the start of a term. The policy and procedures for an administrative leave of absence do not take the place of disciplinary actions that are in response to violations of the Student Code of Conduct or the Academic Honesty Policy, nor do they preclude the removal or dismissal of students from the College as a result of such violations. Placing a Student on Administrative Leave of Absence The Vice President for Student Affairs (or designee) may be alerted to a student's behavior from a variety of sources on campus (Residential Life, 3333/early alert*, Campus Safety, Wellness Center, a faculty or staff member, the student's adviser, etc.). If the Vice President deems it appropriate, these procedures will be initiated: 1. The Vice President for Student Affairs (or designee) will notify the student that an administrative leave is under consideration. 2. The Vice President for Student Affairs (or designee) will discuss with the student the implications of and procedures relating to an administrative leave of absence. A copy of this policy will be provided to the student. Whenever possible and appropriate, the Vice President for Student Affairs (or designee) will encourage the student to take a voluntary leave or withdraw, thereby eliminating the need to complete the process for an administrative leave. 3. The Vice President for Student Affairs (or designee) will confer as feasible and appropriate with the following individuals or their designees regarding the need for an administrative leave of absence: Dean of Academic Affairs, Dean of Student Life, Director of Perrella Wellness Center, Director of Counseling, Director of Campus Safety 4. During these consultations, these individuals will pay particular attention to the criteria for invoking an administrative leave, especially whether the student engages in, or is judged likely to engage in, behavior that poses a danger of causing harm to him/herself or others, or that disrupts the learning environment. 5. The Vice President for Student Affairs (or designee) may require a student to undergo a psychological and/or physical evaluation if she/he believes it will facilitate a more informed decision. The student's refusal or failure to undergo such evaluation will not affect the College's right to invoke and apply this policy. In this event, a final decision will be made without benefit of this information. 6. Following these consultations, the Vice President for Student Affairs (or designee) will make a final decision regarding the administrative leave of absence and must provide written notice of this decision to the student. If an administrative leave is imposed, the Vice President for Student Affairs (or designee) will inform the student of the decision, as well as the specific requirements for reenrollment. If an administrative leave is not imposed, the Vice President for Student Affairs (or designee) may impose other conditions and/or requirements under which the student is allowed to remain at the College. Administrative leaves are effective immediately and in effect for one term, or until any applied sanctions have been removed. A student on administrative leave is not permitted to visit the campus or have contact with anyone on the campus without special 225 permission. An administrative leave cannot be appealed. Administrative leaves may be issued until the last day of classes in a term. Grades of \"W\" will be issued for all courses if the leave is issued within a term. *Prior to initiating a request to proceed with an administrative leave, the 3333/early alert administrator contacts instructors of courses in which the student is registered to determine the duration of class absence. If the student has missed one week of classes, the 3333/early alert administrator attempts to reach the student by email, phone and formal letter within five days of verifying the absences to discuss his or her options and encourage a leave of absence, if necessary. If the student is non-responsive after the third attempt at contact, contact is made with his or her parent or guardian to intervene. If the student is still not responsive after the parent or guardian has been contacted, the 3333/early alert administrator will contact the vice president of student affairs (or designee) to begin administrative leave proceedings. If the student is responsive at any point during the outreach process but the 3333/early alert administrator believes an administrative leave is necessary, he or she will contact the Vice President of Student Affairs (or designee) to begin proceedings. Request for Reenrollment from Administrative Leave A formal, written request for reenrollment after an administrative leave of absence must be submitted to the Vice President for Student Affairs. The student's reenrollment request will be reviewed by the Vice President for Student Affairs (or designee), who mus t approve the reenrollment. When a medical or psychological condition forms the basis of the administrative leave, the student will be notified in writing of the required procedures for reenrollment. In this circumstance the Vice President for Student Affairs (or designee) may consult with the Director of Perrella Wellness Center and/or the Director of the Counseling in deciding whether to approve the student's request to reenroll. Upon approval, a student on administrative leave must complete an \"intent to return from leave of absence\" form at least 15 days prior to the start of the term in which he or she intends to return and submit it to the Registrar's Office. Suspensions Suspension is a compelled separation from the college for academic or disciplinary reasons. Studies at the college are interrupted for a period not less than through the end of the current academic term. The period of suspension may include the college intersession immediately prior to and after any academic term during which the student is prohibited from the college. The suspension may begin while an appeal or hearing is pending. During a suspension, the student is excluded from all college activities and locations, as well as from preregistration. A grade of \"W\" will be entered on the transcript for courses in which the student was enrolled, with the exception that in the case of suspension for academic dishonesty, a grade of \"F\" will be entered for the course in which the academic dishonesty occurred. For courses in which a grade has been entered prior to the suspension (first half courses, for example), the letter grade will stand. Any student who is suspended must cease residing in college housing within twenty-four hours of the beginning of the suspension period unless special permission is granted by the Vice-President for Student Affairs or his or her designee. The Vice-President for Student Affairs may reduce the twenty-four-hour period when deemed appropriate. There is no refund of tuition, room, or board. The conditions under which a student is eligible to return are specified in the letter of suspension, as is the date. Return is contingent upon a favorable review by the Dean of Academic Affairs, in the case of suspension for academic dishonesty; by the Committee on Academic Standards, in the case of a pending appeal of academic dismissal; or by the Vice-President for Student Affairs, in the case of disciplinary suspension. All suspensions are recorded on the student's official academic transcript. Students who do not return at the specified time and whose period of suspension is not extended will be withdrawn. Such students, if they wish to return, must apply for readmission to the College. Academic Leave of Absence Academic leaves are granted to students who wish to study at another college for a specified period of time generally not exceeding one academic year. Academic leaves are normally issued when a student participates in a non-affiliated off-campus program of study. A student desiring an academic leave should contact the off-campus programs office for approval of the leave. The student will be notified of approval in writing by the off-campus programs office. Grades received for courses completed as part of a non-affiliated off-campus program are treated like transfer credit. Grades received for courses completed as part of an affiliated off-campus program of study are applied to a student's academic record and count towards GPA and credit completion requirements. Students participating in non-affiliated programs of study are not eligible for an academic leave of absence and must file a general leave of absence to participate. 226 Note that the term 'affiliated' refers to affiliated programs and programs competed with Hartwick support (i.e. paying tuition directly to Hartwick to participate). Military Leave of Absence Any student who receives orders to report for active military duty should contact the Office of the Registrar and present a copy of military orders (if a copy of military orders is not available, the student may begin the leave process by submitting a personally signed request indicating times and dates of intended call-up). The Office of the Registrar will enter a grade of 'W' for all registered but not completed courses in the current term. If the leave occurs late in the semester, the student may arrange for a final graded evaluation of his/her course work or take Incompletes for all remaining coursework. Upon completion of active military duty, the student will be automatically readmitted to the College by notifying the Office of the Registrar in writing of his/her intent to resume academic study at Hartwick. Official Withdrawal A student who wishes to leave Hartwick and has no plans to return must complete, sign and submit an official withdrawal form to the Office of the Registrar. Students may officially withdraw from the College up to the last day of classes for the term; however, to receive a course grade of \"W\", a Course Add/Drop Form must be submitted to the Office of the Registrar by the regular term deadline for withdrawal with a \"W.\" Students who withdraw after the regular term deadline for course withdrawal with a \"W\" may be subject to course grades of \"F\" for the term in which the withdrawal is being submitted. Students who officially withdraw will have the notation of Official Withdrawal on their record. Students who leave the College without submitting a completed official withdrawal form will be considered to have unofficially withdrawn and will have such a notation posted on their academic record. See the policy on Unofficial Withdrawal for more information. If a student officially withdraws and later wishes to resume study, an Application for Readmission must be made to the Office of the Registrar. Unofficial Withdrawal Students are considered unofficial withdrawals by the college if (1) they have not registered for classes by the end of the add/drop period of Fall, January and Spring terms, (2) they have not returned to the College when the approved period of a leave of absence has expired, (3) they have not returned at the time specified after academic or social conduct suspension, (4) they have left the campus while a term is in session with no intention of returning and not filed appropriate leave or withdrawal paperwork and they do not pass any graded courses. If a student is unofficially withdrawn and later wishes to resume study, an Application for Readmission must be made to the Office of the Registrar. Notice of unofficial withdrawal is posted on a student's academic record. The posted date of an unofficial withdrawal is at the discretion of the College and usually reflects the last date of attendance. Hartwick College uses the following procedures to determine if students never attend class and/or withdraw unofficially, and to determine repayments due back to aid programs. Beginning of each term: 1. Faculty members are reminded by the Office of Academic Affairs that they are required to check class rosters at the end of each add/drop period (for full term, first and second half courses). Faculty report changes to their class rosters to the Office of Academic Affairs, including students who have never attended class to the early alert system for additional follow-up. 2. For students enrolled in classes, financial aid is held, if not already released to the student, for students not attending class. Students are notified that financial aid is on hold until class attendance can be verified. Students who claim they are attending class(es) may have aid reinstated ONLY if their professor(s) confirm attendance by directly contacting the Financial Aid Office (e-mail required). The student's claim to have attended class, absent positive confirmation from the faculty member, does not constitute confirmation of class attendance. 3. After all faculty members have reported to the Office of Academic Affairs, federal aid awards are recalculated for students not attending class(es). Federal awards are adjusted to pay only for classes the student is attending. This adjustment could result in the reduction of aid awarded and/or the loss of grant, scholarship or loan funds. If attendance rosters indicate th e student never attended any classes, all federal financial aid is cancelled and an unofficial withdrawal is issued by the Registrar's Office. This process is repeated for 4 week, 7 week and final grading periods for which faculty are required to submit grades for all students on their rosters. For students receiving failing grades at each of these grading periods, faculty also are required to indicate a last day of attendance. If a failing grade is issued, then the Office of Academic Affairs will follow-up to verify last day of attendance. The College returns aid to the financial aid programs and bills the student for funds received for classes never attended. Repayment may be required with funds other than financial aid. If this occurs and the bill remains unpaid for more than 120 days, a third party collection agency will be used and the debtor will also become liable for any additional collection costs associated with the collection of any amount not paid. Students are ineligible for future aid until debt repaid in full. At the end of each term (Fall, J-Term, Spring): 1. The Registrar creates an exception report of all students with \"F\", \"W\" and/or \"N\" grades for all classes, and notifies the Financial Aid Office as well as the Office of Academic Affairs. 227 2. The Center for Student Success conducts an LDA search on each student to verify if a student had completed the course with a failing grade or stopped attending. If a student stopped attending, then an LDA will be established and Academic Affairs will notify Financial Aid and the Registrar so that the student(s) are unofficially withdrawn. 3. If no last date of attendance is known, then it is assumed to be the 50% point of the term (as allowed by federal regulations). Exception: students reported on the non-attending list are dropped at 100% from those classes. 4. Once the withdrawal date is determined, the Financial Aid Office calculates the amount that must be returned to aid programs by the College and the student, in accordance with federal regulations and College policy. For details, see the Return of Title IVFunds policy which follows. Missed Class Rationale for College-wide Missed Class Policy Hartwick College believes that extra-curricular and co-curricular activities are an integral part of the liberal arts and is dedicated to supporting these experiences for all students. These extra and co-curricular events include: athletics, conference attendance and presentations, registered club events, and career-related interviews. The purpose of a Missed Class Policy is to create a consistent policy which reduces conflict between students needing to participate in extracurricular and co-curricular activities and professors and balances academic integrity and fairness for all students. Missed Class Policy In support of extracurricular and co-curricular participation Hartwick College recognizes the fact that students may occasionally encounter conflicts with attending classes. If they follow the policies and procedures described below, then they will be excused from classes when they are officially representing the College in athletic competition in season, participating in club-sponsored conferences and presentations, or presenting at academic conferences or other significant extracurricular or co-curricular events. Habitual absences from class due to extracurricular or co-curricular events may jeopardize a student's ability to succeed in a class. Therefore, students should avoid scheduling classes in times which would habitually conflict with extracurricular or co- curricular activities. Students will provide each instructor with an agreement letter prior to the end of the first week of the semester (or by the second day of January term) notifying them that they may occasionally have to miss class for an event or competition and will work with the faculty member to complete any missed assignments. In the event that an activity is not known prior to the drop/add period the student will notify the instructor as soon as they are aware of the conflict. In all cases and for all activities students will present the faculty member with a hard copy of a letter detailing the activity, dates of the activity and acknowledgement of the class assignments that will be missed and date for submission of any course work. Students are expected to notify their instructors in whose courses they will be missing academic work \u2014 preferably two weeks before each absence from class \u2014 due to extra-curricular or co-curricular participation. When applicable, the letter also will be signed by appropriate college personnel coordinating the event and will be accompanied by a schedule of conflicting times and will include anticipated departure times. For athletic competitions, students will be excused from class an hour before the scheduled departure time when traveling to away games and an hour before the start of a home competition . In cases in which a student will miss more class sessions than what is outlined in the class syllabus (e.g. 3 absences are allowed), the student will not be disadvantaged by having the final grade reduced due to representing the College as long as all missed work is completed. All work that was due on the day of the missed class will be given to the instructor at a time decided on by the instructor. While some lab periods cannot be administered at a later time, students should be informed of the class expectations upon the first day of class for all classes with a lab component. If expectations are clearly defined on the first day of class, students will be required to plan accordingly in the knowledge that there may or may not be some flexibility with the lab component. After discussing the absence and the process for completing missed work or submitting assignments with the faculty member, th e student will sign the agreement letter which will remain with the instructor. In the case that a student and instructor cannot find agreement on the missed class, the student or faculty member can request a discussion with the coach, Athletics Director, Faculty Athletics Representative, or Student Life Representative in order to seek a resolution. In cases where a resolution cannot be found, the student or faculty member can request a review and discussion by a Missed Class Mediation Board comprising one member of the faculty, one staff member, and one student. The Missed Class Mediation Board will seek to find a compromise which is beneficial to both student and faculty but does not undermine academi c integrity or extra-curricular and co-curricular participation. Official Transcripts A permanent transcript for each student is maintained by the Office of the Registrar. Each student is entitled to one certified transcript of college credits without cost upon graduation (this is included with the diploma). A fee is charged for each additional transcript. The 228 Office of the Registrar does not issue unofficial transcripts to students. Students may obtain an unofficial transcript via their WebAdvisor accounts. No transcript of a student's permanent record will be issued without written authorization from the student. No telephone, fax or third- party requests will be honored. Members of the faculty or administration may have access to the records if they have a legitimate interest in and demonstrate a need for the information. College policy permits the withholding of a transcript until a student's debts, including library and traffic fines, have been paid. Transcript Notations New York Enough is Enough law requiring Hartwick College to make specific notations on the transcripts of respondents found responsible for the following prohibited conduct: sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, and stalking. Students suspended after a finding of responsibility will receive the following notation on their transcript: \"suspended after a finding of responsibility for a code of conduct violation.\" Such notations will remain for at least one year after the conclusion of the suspension, at which point a suspended student can seek removal of the notation by appealing to the Vice President for Studen t Affairs. Students expelled after a finding of responsibility will receive the following notation on their transcript: \"expelled after a finding of responsibility for a code of conduct violation.\" Such notation shall not be eligible for removal. Students who withdraw pending resolution of alleged violations of this Policy will receive the following notation on their transcript: \"withdrew with conduct charges pending.\" Such notation shall not be eligible for removal unless the charges are later resolved. If the College vacates a finding of responsibility for any reason, any such transcript notation shall be removed. Overall Average Honors Upon degree completion, students are awarded degrees with honor as follows: Summa cum laude-3.850 or higher cumulative grade point average Magna cum laude-3.650 or higher cumulative grade point average Cum laude-3.400 or higher cumulative grade point average A student who has transferred academic credit to Hartwick College is eligible to graduate with honors only if the grade point average for the student's entire college career, including grades received for transfer courses, falls into one of the categories above. In accordance with the Access to Release Educational Records policy found elsewhere in the catalog, students may request to view transcripts on file from non-Hartwick institutions at any time. Protection Against Prejudicial or Capricious Grading A student should have protection against prejudicial and capricious grading. The following policy is established for reviewing complaints about end- of-term grades: the student shall first consult the professor and Department Chair; if no agreement is reached, the student may then bring the case to the Committee on Academic Standards. The Committee shall serve as a review board and, if a change seems justified, the Committee shall be empowered to recommend a change of grade to the professor. Readmission (from Withdrawal, Academic Dismissal or for a Second Degree) Any student who has withdrawn, been academically dismissed from the institution or is interested in returning to complete a second degree after graduation is eligible to apply for readmission. A student applying for readmission must submit a readmission application at least 15 business days prior to the start of a term. To be considered for readmission, a student must complete the following steps prior to the desired term of reentry: 1. Complete and submit the Application for Readmission form to the Office of the Registrar. 2. Request that official transcripts from colleges or universities attended while away from Hartwick College to be sent to the Office of the Registrar at least one week prior to the start of the desired reentry term. 3. If you are applying for readmission from an academic dismissal you must provide an additional essay describing any and all activities in which you have been engaged during your time away from Hartwick that you believe will contribute positively to achieving your academic goals. The readmission review process begins when all application materials have been received. Readmission applications are reviewed by the Registrar and Dean of Student Life. 229 *Please note: A student who was academically dismissed is eligible to apply readmission through the Office of the Registrar with acceptance decisions subject to approval by CAS. A student who has graduated from Hartwick and wishes to return to complete a second degree must apply for readmission through the Registrar's Office. Upon readmission the student is considered a transfer and up to 60 of his or her prior Hartwick credits may be applied toward the new degree. Second Degree (effective July 1, 2014) Students who wish to earn two degrees must satisfy the major requirements of a department in each area and complete an additional 30 credits for a total of at least 150 credits. Performance music credits beyond 12 credits WICK 101, Transfer Transitions, and Physical Education credits do not count toward this requirement. It is assumed that students pursuing this option will complete an extra year of study. Students may only pursue a Bachelor of Arts (BA) with a Bachelor of Science (BS) degree under this policy. Pursuing two Bachelor of Arts or two Bachelor of Science degrees is not permitted. Special Students (Non-Degree Seeking, Part Time Students) In special cases students who are not matriculated at Hartwick or other institutions may be admitted as part-time students (taking no more than 8 credits in the fall and spring terms, and 4 credits in January term). The standards for admission for special students are comparable to those that govern those who apply for matriculated status. Students with no Hartwick affiliation desiring special student status must contact the Admissions Office for an application. High school (or equivalent) students wishing to enroll must contact the Office of Academic Affairs for an application. Students with a Hartwick affiliation (spouse, parent, etc.) desiring special student status must contact the Office of Office of the Registrar for an application. Special students will be required to provide official collegiate transcripts and may be requested to provide official high school transcripts with test scores prior to admission. Upon acceptance, students may register in classes on a space-available basis, with instructor approval, assuming they have satisfied course prerequisites. Special students must submit a special student application each term in order to remain active. If an application is not received for the term immediately following the first term a student registers for a course, he or she is made inactive. Standards of NYS Student Aid Eligibility Academic Eligibility for NYS Student Aid (including scholarships and TAP): The following academic eligibility requirements apply for the granting of New York State student aid: Enrollment Requirements Awards are granted only to full-time matriculated students. According to state guidelines, full-time students must enroll for a minimum of 12 credits for the Fall Term and 12 credits for the January/Spring terms. Repeating a course does not count toward the required number of courses for that term. The State Education Department permits the January Term to be used with the Spring Term only and it cannot be used to make up a Fall Term deficiency. Every recipient must have a major declared or an ISP approved by the end of the sophomore year. Failure to meet enrollment requirements results in loss of the award for that term. Program Pursuit Satisfactory program pursuit is defined as receiving a passing or failing grade in a certain percentage of a full-time course load in each term for which an award is received. The percentage increases from 50 percent of the minimum full-time course load in each term of study in the first year for which an award is received, to 75 percent of the minimum full-time course load in each term of study in the second year for which an award is received, to 100 percent of the minimum full-time course load in each term thereafter. Students must complete (with a grade of A, B, C, D or F) a minimum number of courses each term as follows: 6 credits per term in the first year an award is received; 9 credits per term in the second year an award is received; 12 credits per term each term thereafter. Incompletes are permitted if the course is finished prior to the end of the next term. In addition, a certain number of credits must be accrued (successfully completed with grades of A, B, C or D) and a minimum cumulative GPA attained each term as follows: Before being certified for this payment 1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th 6th 7th 8th 9th 10th 230 Minimum number of credits accrued 0 3 9 21 33 45 60 75 90 105 Minimum GPA 0 1.1 1.2 1.3 2.0 2.0 2.0 2.0 2.0 2.0 For Students first receiving aid in 2010-11 and thereafter: Before being certified for this payment 1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th 6th 7th 8th 9th 10th Minimum number of credits accrued 0 6 15 27 39 51 66 81 96 111 Minimum GPA 0 1.5 1.8 1.8 2.0 2.0 2.0 2.0 2.0 2.0 Failure to meet program pursuit or satisfactory academic progress requirements results in the loss of the award for the subsequent term. A student may request a waiver of the above standards ONLY ONE TIME as an undergraduate. Request will be considered on an individual basis and granted only for exceptional or extraordinary circumstances relating to death of a close relative, serious personal illness or injury, or other personal extenuating circumstances. The request for waiver will be reviewed and determined by the certifying officer and the Registrar. For information regarding New York State Awards, contact the Higher Education Services Corporation, Office of Grants and Awards, 99 Washington Avenue, Albany, New York 12255, www.hesc.org, or your high school guidance counselor. Visiting Students Visiting students are matriculated students in good standing at other campuses who wish to pursue coursework at Hartwick that is uniquely relevant to their educational programs. Visiting students may enroll in a normal course load at Hartwick, so long as they have explicit permission from their home colleges. Such students must submit an official statement documenting their status in goo d standing and the approval of the Dean or other designated authority from the student's home institution to the Office of the Registrar. No other application information is required. If a visiting student subsequently applies for regular admission to Hartwick, full admissions documentation must be presented. Waiver of Academic Requirements Requests for waivers of academic requirements must be addressed to the Committee on Academic Standards. Petitions should be addressed to the committee and submitted to the Office of the Registrar. Requests for waiver of Liberal Arts in Practice general education requirements must be addressed to the Dean of Academic Affairs. Waiver of Foreign Language Requirement International students whose first language is not English or who spoke at home a language other than English will be waived from the foreign language requirement. This waiver can include students from countries whose official language is English if the preceding conditions are fulfilled. If a U.S. citizen was born elsewhere, attended high school in that country, and studied a language other than English, s/he may be waived from the foreign language requirement based on the high school document. U.S. students are required to fulfill the foreign language requirement. If a student speaks a language other than English at home, s/he may take a proficiency test in that language to fulfill the requirement.
