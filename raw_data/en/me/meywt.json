Families deserve complete and unbiased information with support each step of the way. All patients and families are treated with equal care and respect. The team is made up of patients, families, doctors, and staff. The spirit of Children's Hospital is built on respect and open communication. Highest quality patient care is our first priority and obligation to the community. Continuous improvement is necessary to sustain the quality of care our patients deserve. A family-friendly, developmentally appropriate environment that is safe and clean is essential to healing. Safety is of the utmost importance and a part of our culture at Children's Hospital. We work together to eliminate serious harm and to keep patients safe. 4 Follow the 1, 2, 3 Back to Basics This program promotes health and healing, while also lowering the risk of infection. These are the basics: 1 bath (or shower) every day to lower the number of germs on your skin. Mouth care at least 2 times a day to keep your mouth healthy. Being active at least 3 times a day to keep your body strong. Follow our handwashing rules Ask everyone who comes into your child's room to wash or foam their hands first. Our rule is: every entry, every exit, every patient, every time! If there are Contact Precautions signs on your child's door, do what they say This is very important and will help prevent the spread of infection. T ell us if your child has any allergies or eats a special diet This includes allergies or bad reactions to food, medicines, or dyes. Also, tell us if your child can only eat certain foods.

If they're required to use a car seat, it's not legal for you to let them ride in your car without one. These are the things you need to do: Make sure that all passengers are properly restrained in your vehicle. Do not let any child ride without the correct car seat or seat belt. Properly installed car seats shouldn't move more than one inch side-to-side and front-to-back. The car seat harness clip should be level with the child's armpit. Have your car seat checked by a certified child passenger safety technician. For more information and to find a list of child safety seat fitting stations in Tennessee and Kentucky go to ChildrensHospitalVanderbilt.org/carseats. Children younger than 12 should always ride in the back seat. We also recommend that you review and stay up to date on the Tennessee Child Restraint Law.
