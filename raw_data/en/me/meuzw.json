The assessment may involve an internal (vaginal and/or rectal) examination depending on the issue and your comfort with this type of exam day one. An internal exam is the only way we can truly assess the status of the pelvic floor muscles (tight, tender, weak). Treatment differs depending on the status of these muscles. If they are tight, we have to work on relaxing them, which may include some internal myofascial work, education and home exercises. If they are weak, we need to work on activation, strength, and endurance of the pelvic floor muscles, which may include some education and home exercises. Implementing the right treatment from the beginning will help resolve your issues and/or pain more effectively and efficiently. Taking this approach typically leads to more meaningful and long-lasting changes versus a temporary relief or a quick fix. All sessions are one on one with a Pelvic Health Physiotherapist. Overall, treatments may include: soft tissue/myofascial techniques internally (vaginal and/or rectal) and/or externally, core exercises (strengthening, lengthening, or endurance), breathing exercises, functional exercises with core engagement (squatting, bending, running, lifting, etc), and joint mobilization, and acupuncture as necessary.
