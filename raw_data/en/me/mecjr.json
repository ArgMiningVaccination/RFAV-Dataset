I offer curated recommendations from trusted gold-standard suppliers ensuring they are appropriate to be taken alongside any existing medication you may be taking. HERBAL MEDICINE SUPPORTING YOUR HEALTH, NATURALLY & SAFELY Just because a medicine is natural, does not necessarily mean it is safe, or appropriate to use. As an allopathic physician and integrative medicine doctor, I prefer to recommend researched herbal medicines with proven efficacy when used in conjunction with typically prescribed Western medicines. HERBAL MEDICINE THE BENEFITS OF HERBAL MEDICINE The natural world provides a wide array of plants and herbs that can support our health and wellbeing in a variety of ways. Many are cheap and freely available: from the calming properties of chamomile, to the medicinal properties of sage and the soothing salves that come from calendula. HERBAL MEDICINE FINDING THE BEST HERBAL REMEDIES FOR YOU Botanicals and supplements are regulated by the FDA as food and not drugs, which means their purity and quality can be highly variable. All supplements and botanicals I recommend come from the same trusted, [quality-assured suppliers](https://fullscript.com/) I use myself. If we find herbal remedies and supplements to be of help to you in your care plan, I offer curated recommendations via the [Fullscript](https://fullscript.com/) site that allows you to purchase directly. HERBAL MEDICINE facts Botanicals and supplements are a HUGE market, and are regulated as foods by the FDA and not as drugs. As such, companies that sell them are not under as strict laws regarding purity and quality. Sourcing quality herbal medicines is incredibly important.
