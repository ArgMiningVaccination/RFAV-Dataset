In addition to a growing interest from government for greater faith engagement, there is also a growing interest from government in better understanding the nature of faith communities. Emergency managers and their public health and behavioral health partners are increasingly involved in providing crisis response within a religiously pluralistic environment. As noted by Stephen Prothero in his book Religious Literacy - What Every American Needs to Know - And Doesn't, the United States is \"both Christian and pluralistic. Christianity may dominate, but this nation of immigrants is also a nation of religions,\" with dozens of world religions represented. Therefore, it is important for response plans and engagement with communities to include religious literacy and competency. Those who are committed to enhancing their religious literacy and competency skills are more likely to be effective caregivers and responders to the whole community than those who are not. This primer provides information on basic religious literacy for more than 20 of the largest religious communities in the United States. It is geared toward enabling emergency managers and their public and behavioral health partners to understand how faith communities and emergency management intersect. The reference structure should allow a reader to be quickly oriented to the content. The information is written in a broad overview format so care should be taken to not over-generalize. Each individual in a faith community is unique in how they understand and interpret the mandates and the teachings of their faith tradition. While this primer has been deeply reviewed by many religious scholars, there will always be differing opinions and interpretations, even within a single tradition. We define and classify religious traditions as they define themselves, not by how others may view them. With this in mind, this guide best serves as a baseline for basic religious literacy that should be augmented by field experience working with religious communities and individuals in emergency management settings. Reliable statistics on religious affiliation in the United States are notoriously difficult to obtain. Population statistics for each religious group were collected from several different sources. These numbers are often the subject of intense debate, so they should be considered estimates based on sources in the Works Referenced section. We are indebted to the U.K. Home Office and Cabinet Office resource: The Needs of Faith Communities in Major Emergencies: Some Guidelines. Their work was the inspiration for developing this guide.RELIGIOUS LITERACY IS THE BASIC UNDERST ANDING OF EACH FAITH COMMUNITY , ITS THEOLOGY , RITUALS , PRACTICES AND SACRED TEXTS .

Founder(s) Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h (12 November 1817 - 29 May 1892) is the founder of the Bah\u00e1'\u00edFaith, born in Tehran, Persia (present-day Iran). The B\u00e1b (1819-1850) was Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h's forerunner; having founded the B\u00e1bi Faith and heralded the coming of Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h. Bah\u00e1'\u00eds refer to the B\u00e1b and Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h as Twin. Abdu'lBaha the eldest son of Baha'u'llah succeeded him in 1892 and led the community until his death on 28 November, 1921. Shoghi Effendi Rabbani, eldest Grandson of Abdu'lBaha, succeeded as Guardian after his grandfather's death in 1921 until his death in 1957. In Shoghi Effendi's final message to the Baha'i World, dated October 1957, he named the Hands of the Cause of God, \"the Chief Stewards of Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h's embryonic World Commonwealth.\" Consequently, following Shoghi Effendi's passing, the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith was temporarily stewarded by the Hands of the Cause until the election of the Universal House of Justice in 1963.

Abolition of extremes of wealth and poverty. Equality of the sexes. sacred t exts The Bah\u00e1'\u00ed scriptures comprise the sacred Writings of Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h, Founder of the Faith, and of his forerunner, the B\u00e1b. The Writings of 'Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1, Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h's eldest son and successor is also included in the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed scriptures. Bah\u00e1'\u00ed scriptures are translated into many languages. The Bah\u00e1'\u00ed scriptures belong to all; there are no restrictions on who may touch or handle the books, provided they are treated with respect.Nine-Pointed Star12 Religious liteRacy PRimeR \u00a9 NDIN 2014 v .1sacred Buildings/ structures Sacred buildings include the Shrine of the Bab and the Shrine of Baha'u'llah in Haifa and Akka, Israel, respectively. There are eight Houses of Worship throughout the world intended for worship of God by followers of all faiths. Larger Bah\u00e1'\u00ed communities may have a Bah\u00e1'\u00ed center as a gathering place, but it is not considered sacred. governance (Judicatory) The Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Administrative Order refers to the judicatory system of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith, and is split into two parts: the elected and the appointed. The supreme governing institution of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith is the Universal House of Justice, located in Haifa, Israel. Each country has its own national spiritual assembly comprised of nine members elected from the believers in that country. governance (congregation) Defined by 'Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1, \"Spiritual Assembly\" is a term that refers to elected councils that govern the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith. Because the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith has no clergy, the elected councils carry out the affairs of the community. Spiritual Assemblies are chosen at both the local level and the national level. Point of contact Local: Local Spiritual Assembly (LSA) Regional: Regional Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Council (RBC) National: National Spiritual Assembly (NSA) religious leaders No clergy; members of the local spiritual assembly, elected by the congregation, provide leadership. religious objects/symbols Symbols include: The Greatest Name: calligraphy of the phrase Y\u00e1Bah\u00e1'u'l-Abh\u00e1 (O Glory of Glories). Ring-stone symbol (which also serves as an aid to teaching and proclamation): three horizontal strokes representing the world of God, the world of God's Manifestations, and the world of humanity; a vertical line passing through the three horizontals as an indicator of their interconnectedness; two five-point stars, representing the B\u00e1b and Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h (the Twin Messengers of God for this age). Nine-pointed star (the number nine has great and varied significance for Bah\u00e1'\u00eds, and - as the highest single-digit number, symbolizes completeness). Facilitating Practices Provide privacy for obligatory daily prayer. culture & social interaction Bah\u00e1'\u00eds represent many nations and ethnicities of the world. Generalization will not be useful. gender roles/interaction One of the fundamental teachings of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith is that men and women are equal and that the equality of the sexes is a spiritual and moral standard that is essential for the unification of the planet and the unfolding of peace. Principal Weekly observance(s) The Bah\u00e1'\u00ed calendar is based upon 19 months of 19 days each. Each month has the name of one of God's virtues or attributes. Baha'is gather for \"feast\" (their communal worship service) the first day of every Bah\u00e1'\u00ed month. Days begin at sunset on the previous solar day and end at sunset of the present solar day. BAh\u00e1'\u00ed \u00a9 NDIN 2014 v .1 v.1 \u00a9 NDIN 2014 Religious liteRacy PRimeR 13daily religious Practices Bah\u00e1'\u00eds over the age of 15 must individually perform obligatory prayer daily, choosing from among a short, medium, or long prayer. In addition, believers are directed to meditate, to study scripture, and to offer devotional prayer daily. There is no set form for this. However, devotional prayers written by the central figures of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith and collected in prayer books are held in high esteem. Reading aloud of prayers from prayer books is a typical feature of Bah\u00e1'\u00ed gatherings. In the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith the Qiblih is the location that Bah\u00e1'\u00eds should face when saying their daily obligatory prayers, and is fixed at the Shrine of Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h in Bahj\u00ed, near Akk\u00e1, in present day Israel. holy days/Festivals There are nine Bah\u00e1'\u00ed holy days each year during which Bah\u00e1'\u00eds do not work: March 21: Naw-Ruz (Bah\u00e1'\u00ed New Year). April 21: First day of Ridvan (meaning paradise), when Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h resided in a garden in Baghdad and proclaimed his mission as God's messenger for this age). April 29: Ninth day of Ridvan. May 2: Twelfth day of Ridvan. May 23: Declaration of the Bab in Shiraz. May 29: Ascension of Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h. July 9: Martyrdom of the Bab (day of execution). October 20: Birth of the Bab in Shiraz. November 12: Birth of Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h. rituals/ceremonies The Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith has no set rituals aside of the postures and actions mentioned in the medium and long obligatory prayers. Bah\u00e1'\u00eds fast annually one Bah\u00e1'\u00ed month from March 2-20 during which they take no food or drink during the daylight hours. dress (religious restrictions)Baha'is observe moderation and modesty in dress. death: dying Practices There are no special religious requirements for Bah\u00e1'\u00eds who are dying, but they may wish to have a family member or friend to pray and read the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed scriptures with them. Bah\u00e1'\u00eds believe that the reality of an individual is spiritual, not physical. The body is seen as the throne of the soul, worthy to be treated with honor and respect, even when dead. Bah\u00e1'\u00eds believe that, after death, the soul continues to progress to the next stage of existence closer to God. death: Body Preparation The body is carefully washed and wrapped in white silk or cotton, by family members or by others, according to the family's preference; the family may choose to allow others to observe the preparation of the body. The body is not cremated; the body should be buried within an hour's traveling time from the place of death. Unless required by law, the body should not be embalmed. The body is buried in a coffin of as durable a material as possible. While it is preferable that the body should be buried with the head pointing towards Qiblih, fixed at the Shrine of Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h in Bahj\u00ed, near Akk\u00e1, in present day Israel, this is not an absolute requirement, and may be impossible in some cemeteries without using two burial plots. This is a matter for the family. At some time before interment, a special prayer for the dead is recited for deceased Bah\u00e1'\u00eds aged 15 or over. This is the only specific requirement of a Bah\u00e1\u00b9\u00ed funeral service.BAh\u00e1'\u00ed 14 Religious liteRacy PRimeR \u00a9 NDIN 2014 v .1dietary laws and customs Bah\u00e1'\u00eds abstain from alcohol, but can take it in medicine. Bah\u00e1'\u00eds over the age of 15 observe an annual total fast from sunrise (approx. 6.30am) to sunset (approx. 5.45pm), March 2nd - 20th. Bah\u00e1'\u00eds who are ill, pregnant, breast-feeding, menstruating, or who have been traveling substantial distances are excused from this fast. health (medical care) Bah\u00e1'\u00eds believe in the healing power of modern medicine for physical ills while recognizing the role of the spirit, prayer, and turning to God. There is no objection to being touched or treated by members of the opposite gender. Blood transfusions, organ donations, and the administration of prescription drugs are all acceptable. Consumption of alcohol or mind-altering drugs is forbidden, except when prescribed by a physician. health (mental health) Bah\u00e1'\u00eds believe in the healing power of modern medicine for mental illness, while recognizing the role of the spirit, prayer, and turning to God. There is no objection to being touched or treated by members of the opposite gender. Consumption of alcohol or mind-altering drugs is forbidden except when prescribed by a physician. Pregnancy and Birth Prayers for the unborn child are often recited. Bah\u00e1'\u00eds do not believe in abortion, except in unusual circumstances since they believe life begins at conception. For service Providers Physical contact There is no objection to being touched or treated by members of the opposite gender. dietary restrictions Bah\u00e1'\u00eds abstain from alcohol, except when prescribed by a physician. medical t reatment Generally, Bah\u00e1'\u00eds are open to use of conventional and state-of-the-art medical procedures. mental health care Generally, Bah\u00e1'\u00eds are open to conventional mental health care options. mass care Facilities There is no objection to mixed-gender wards/care settings, but older Bah\u00e1'\u00eds may prefer single-gender. Bah\u00e1'\u00ed patients will be ministered to by friends, by family and by those appointed as spiritual caregivers by the community. Because the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed faith has no sacraments, these spiritual caregivers do not have a sacramental or priestly/ministerial role, nor do they have any authority over the patient.BAh\u00e1'\u00ed \u00a9 NDIN 2014 v .1 v.1 \u00a9 NDIN 2014 Religious liteRacy PRimeR 15BUDDHISM Adherents consider themselves BUddhist. Adherents Are c Alled BUddhists. the religion is c Alled BUddhism. U.s. Population 3,348,000 language (Worship) Varies with branch and community; possibilities include Burmese, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Pali, Sanskrit, Sinhala, Thai, Tibetan. Founder Siddhartha Gautama (c. 563 - 483 bce), called the Buddha; also sometimes called Shakyamuni (\"of the Shakya clan\"). Branches & denominations U.S. Buddhism takes many forms\u2014some of which stress self-help, some of which stress \"other-help\" (e.g. reliance on the Buddha of Boundless Light). Variations often reflect ethnic origins of a community's monastic or teaching lineage. Broadly, Buddhism's major branches are: Theravada\u2014including various schools in the south and southeast Asian countries of Bangladesh, Burma, Cambodia, Laos, Sri Lanka, and Thailand. Mahayana\u2014including Pure Land, Ch'an, Zen, Son; goes by the name Soka Gakkai International (SGI) and prefer to be referred to as SGI. Vajrayana\u2014including various Tibetan schools and other forms of esoteric Buddhism (e.g., Shingon in Japan). Basic t enets Many Buddhists embrace: Confession of the Triple Jewel/Triple Refuge: \"I go to the Buddha for strength; I go to the Dharma [the Buddha's teachings] for I strength.\" The Theravada, Mahayana, and Vajrayana streams differ in their definition of these terms. Belief in the Four Noble Truths: the inevitability of suffering; that suffering's origin is desire; that suffering will end when desire ends; that desire is extinguished by following the Noble Eightfold Path (Buddhism's Middle Way of morality, concentration, and wisdom). Belief in karma, in samsara (the endless cycle of birth, death, and rebirth: not in the sense that souls migrate from one body to another, but rather in the sense that all life is interconnected; thus, what cycles endlessly is the accumulation of good and bad influences), and in the possibility of achieving enlightenment, thus passage to Nirvana. A notion of \"emptiness\" (particularly in Mahayana and Vajrayana streams). Emptiness teaches the lack of substantiality or independence of things, and stresses the idea of no independent origination, that the present state of all things is the result of a previous state. Emptiness includes the teaching of impermanence; everything is always in a state of change. In other words, everything, including every sentient being, is an ever-changing process. This teaching loosens all attachments to views, stories and assumptions, leaving the mind empty of all greed, anger, and delusion; therefore empty of suffering of stress, anxiety, frustration and unsatisfactoriness. 1Dharma Wheel 16 Religious liteRacy PRimeR .1sacred t exts Theravada: Tipitaka (Tripitaka; Three Baskets), particularly the Dhammapada (the second Basket). Also called the Pali Canon, the Tipitaka is a 32-volume collection of teachings of the Buddha and his disciples. Mahayana: various Sutras (collections of teachings); each school of thought and practice has its preferred sutra(s), many in the language of the home country of that tradition; examples include the Lotus Sutra, Heart Sutra, Flower Garland Sutra. Vajrayana: various tantras (texts about esoteric practices) and shastras (commentaries). sacred Buildings/ structuresDepending on the branch of Buddhism, places of worship or practice may be called: Vihara (Theravada monastery/temple). Zendo (Zen meditation (Tibetan monastic college). Stupa (a votive containing relics). Temple. Monastery. governance (Judicatory) No single governing structure has overarching authority over all U.S. Buddhists. Buddhist movements may have a governing structure and national or world headquarters. In many U.S. urban regions, Buddhist leaders from varying traditions have formed a Buddhist Council which facilitates collaborative celebration (especially of Wesak\u2014the Buddha's Birthday) and social action. governance (congregation) Some American temples and practice-groups are autonomous. Others acknowledge the authority of some umbrella organization (e.g. Buddhist Churches of America; Won Buddhism; BLIA; Shinnyo-en). Priests, monks, or nuns may acknowledge association with a specific monastic lineage; they may be under the authority of a spiritual leader within their denomination, movement, or stream of thought.

Minister (Won leaders). Reverend (used by many reform movements as both noun and adjective to designate ordained leader). Ordained clergy exist in all three major branches. In Mahayana traditions, an ordained cleric may take additional vows not found in Theravada lineages. Some Mahayana lineages, especially of Tibetan and Japanese forms, include hybrid lay and clerical ordinations. The ordination of women in Buddhism as nuns (\"Bhikkuni\") is currently and historically practiced in the Mahayana tradition in regions such as East Asia, and now once again in Sri Lanka, as well as newly beginning in some Western countries to which Buddhism has recently spread, such as the United States. religious objects/symbols Incense, oil lamps (or electric substitutes), flower and fruit offerings, a mala (string of beads) are in common use. Images and religious objects include: Theravada: Buddha statue; Dharma Wheel. Mahayana: varies according to the particular school of thought - for example: Pure Land: Buddha statues (including Amitabha/Amida Buddha), various bodhisattvas (particularly the Bodhisattva of Boundless Compassion); swastika (representing samsara); Wheel of Becoming (representing samsara). In Chinese Buddhism, Ch'an and Pure Land imagery may be similar. Zen: Great Empty Circle (Jpn. Unso). Won: Unbroken circle. Shinnyo-en: Reclining Buddha. Soka Gakkai: Hanging Scroll in Praise of the Lotus Sutra by Nichiren. Vajrayana: Prayer wheel, prayer bell, mandalas (sacred designs). Facilitating practices Buddhists are not monotheists (many are nontheists), and will find reference to \"God\" by attending spiritual caregivers inappropriate. A calm and peaceful environment with minimal distractions, especially for dying persons, is desirable. culture & social interactionTremendous variation among U.S. Buddhists, dependent more on ethnicity than religion. gender roles/interaction Traditionally, Theravada nuns and monks touch no one, and should not be touched. However, in the U.S. context, some Theravada monks no longer adhere to the prohibition of cross-gender touching/hand-shaking. Traditional Buddhist teaching lends itself to the idea of gender equality, however certain gender limitations do exist in Buddhism and multiple canonical sources claim a second-class status of women in the Sangha.BUddhism 18 Religious liteRacy PRimeR \u00a9 NDIN 2014 v .1Principal Weekly observance(s)In the U.S., many Buddhist communities hold weekly (or otherwise regular) gatherings for meditation, chanting, or other devotional practices; often dharma talks are offered regularly. daily practices Many Buddhists practice daily chanting, meditation, or both. Some may perform puja (offering) by placing fresh fruit, flowers, and water before a statue of the Buddha; some also offer light (via an oil lamp) and incense. Some perform daily ritual prostrations. holy days/festivals Buddhist holidays celebrate important moments in the life of the Buddha: his birth, enlightenment, and entry into Nirvana. The Buddhist calendar is essentially lunar and is not standardized among Buddhist traditions. U.S. Buddhist communities may observe the same festival (including Wesak\u2014 the Buddha's Birthday) on significantly different dates. Full-moon days have special significance for many Buddhist schools of practice. Within individual traditions of Buddhism, other holidays recognizing unique historical events and other observances are observed. rituals/ceremonies Tremendous variation among U.S. Buddhist communities. Some communities conduct a Buddha's Birthday ceremony during which sweet tea is poured over a Buddha statue. Buddhist communities with Japanese origins may conduct an annual Floating Lantern Ceremony in honor of the departed. Vajrayana practitioners undertake initiations such as the Kalachakra, which is about attaining Buddhahood and promoting peace. dress (religious restrictions)Lay Buddhists dress in any way they choose. In some communities, lay Buddhists may wear robes or insignia similar to clergy, particularly when attending community gatherings for meditation or instruction. With regard to clergy: In some streams of Buddhism, monks and nuns shave their heads; in others, they do not. The color and style of robes for monks, nuns, priests, or ministers varies from one stream of Buddhism to another. death: dying Practices Buddhists see death as a natural part of a continuum of birth, illness, decline, death, and rebirth. Many Buddhists wish to maintain a clear mind when dying, thus may refuse pain-relieving drugs if mental alertness will be impaired. In most Buddhist traditions, there is a concept of an indeterminate time and state before rebirth into another form, which is why ritualization in the period immediately after death and the days following is considered critical. For some Buddhists, rituals at death are aimed at promoting human rebirth in the next life, as well as preventing rebirth in the lower realms. A person's state of mind at the moment of death is believed to influence rebirth. It is helpful for someone who is dying to have a quiet environment. Some Buddhists may wish to summon a monk to perform some chanting of sacred texts in order to engender wholesome thoughts in the mind of the dying person.BUddhism \u00a9 NDIN 2014 v .1 v.1 \u00a9 NDIN 2014 Religious liteRacy PRimeR 19death: Body Preparation Buddhists from certain traditions (e.g., Tibetan) may request that the body not be handled or moved for an hour (or more) after death, and may require a religious professional to perform a rite of passage. With this exception, normal hospital postmortem procedures will be acceptable. Preparation of the body for the funeral is frequently left to an undertaker, but in some instances relatives may also wish to be involved. Customs concerning dressing the body vary widely. The body is usually cremated rather than buried. dietary laws and customs diet (religious restrictions)Many Buddhists are vegetarian or vegan (but certainly not all). Buddhist nuns and monks in traditions coming to the U.S. from China, Taiwan, Korea, and Vietnam observe a vegetarian diet. Some Buddhists observe a fast on full-moon days and new-moon days. On fasting or festival days, a Buddhist might wish to abstain from eating after noon. Theravada nuns and monks, and sometimes other Buddhist monastics, do not eat at all after noon. health (medical care) Buddhists generally will accept any medical treatment that will prolong life\u2014if it is likely to restore the ability to foster understanding and compassion. Medication is acceptable when it facilitates healing or comfort. In cases where the patient cannot recover or be restored to mindfulness, many Buddhists will prefer no further medical intervention. health (mental health) Buddhists may believe that healing and recovery are promoted by awakening to wisdom of the Buddha, which is spiritual peace and freedom from anxiety. Buddhists may utilize meditation practices to maintain mental equilibrium during stressful times. The Buddhist patient (or family or friends) may wish to chant to generate calmness and positive energy. The desire to maintain clarity of mind may outweigh the desire for pain medication. Pregnancy and birth Some Buddhists may embrace rituals and concerns related to pregnancy and childbirth that have ethnic and cultural roots (rather than roots in Buddhism per se). There is no single Buddhist view on abortion. Buddhists regard life as beginning at conception, but are divided as to whether there are absolute rules and whether exceptions can be made.

Population 387,100 language (Worship) English (with some U.S. congregations worshiping in the language preferred by their local congregations.) Old Order Amish and Old Order Mennonites often use Pennsylvania German while Hutterites use a dialect of German known as Hutterite German or Hutterisch among themselves and Lutheran German in worship. Founder(s) Anabaptism is a movement which developed alongside Protestant Christianity during the Reformation, with origins in Switzerland and Germany. Mennonites were named after one of their early Dutch leaders, Menno Simons. The Amish were named after one of the later leaders, Jakob Amman, and the Hutterites were named after Jakob Hutter. Branches & denominations Of about 20 Anabaptist-related denominations in the U.S., the largest groups include the Beachy Amish, Brethren in Christ, Conservative Mennonites, Holdeman Mennonites, Brethren, Mennonite Order Amish. Basic t enets Mennonite theology emphasizes the teachings of Jesus and the ideal of a religious community based on New Testament models and imbued with the spirit of the Sermon on the Mount. Core beliefs deriving from Anabaptist traditions include: Salvation through faith in Jesus Christ. The authority of scripture and the Holy Spirit. Believer's baptism as a sign of conscious commitment to a way of life. Discipleship understood as an outward sign of an inward change. Discipline in the church, informed by New Testament teachings, particularly of Jesus. The Lord's Supper understood as a memorial rather than as a sacrament or Christian rite, ideally shared by baptized believers within the unity and discipline of the church. Commitment to non-violence - included among the \"historic peace churches\". Mennonites and some other groups prefer peaceful methods of dispute resolution and do not support violent or lethal action by government agencies/ police even in the case of an active shooter. Mutual accountability within the group for ethical/moral conduct. sacred t exts The Christian Bible (comprising an Old Testament of 39 books and the 27 books of the New Testament) is foundational for all Anabaptists. Scripture is to be read and interpreted in community through the unifying presence of the Holy Spirit. Christian Cross22 Religious liteRacy PRimeR \u00a9 NDIN 2014 v .1sacred Buildings/ structuresMost Anabaptists call their worship site a \"church.\" Some call it a meetinghouse. Most of the Amish meet in homes. Some Anabaptists meet in borrowed space (e.g. a school auditorium) or use a commercial space. governance (Judicatory) Some Anabaptist churches are part of a national governing structure (e.g. Mennonite Church USA, Brethren in Christ), often organized into regional \"conferences.\" While the congregation is the center of decision-making for most Anabaptist churches, mutual accountability within a regional conference is typical. governance (congregation) Many local congregations (even those of denominations with a robust regional or national governing structure) are self-governing, within the context of mutual accountability. Often, local governance is in the hands of an elected committee. Point of contact Local: Local congregations are usually led by a pastor/pastoral team Regional: Varies by denomination (sometimes a Bishop or judicatory body) National: Varies by denomination religious leaders Common terms for Anabaptist leaders include: minister, pastor, deacon, elder, bishop. Few Anabaptists use the term \"Reverend\" among themselves; historically, the preferred title has been \"Brother/Sister\" for every member; more recent usage has included \"Pastor.\" religious objects/symbols Traditionally, Anabaptists have not used standardized visual symbols in worship or to identify themselves. Individual congregations/conferences/denominations may design their own symbols to aid in worship or to express their particular mission in the world. An empty cross is used in some Anabaptist churches as a symbol. Facilitating Practices Ask family what practices they turn to for support and provide privacy as needed. culture & social interactionAnabaptists' engagement in cultural/social interaction ranges widely, from the Amish, who are primarily focused within their own communities, to more evangelical Mennonites who focus on mission and service projects locally or internationally. Old Order Amish do not use electricity and use horse and buggy for transportation instead of cars. Amish generally refer to non-Amish as \"English\". When interacting with police/law enforment, Mennonites and some other groups prefer peaceful methods of dispute resolution and do not support violent or lethal action by police, even in the case of an active shooter. gender roles/interaction Many Mennonite denominations and churches include women and men equally in leadership. The Amish and other more conservative groups limit authority structures and leadership positions to men. Principal Weekly observance(s)Most Anabaptists gather weekly for communal worship involving singing, Bible readings, and a sermon. Most do this on Sunday mornings; a few meet at other times for convenience. Many hold Sunday School for children; some also provide Sunday morning educational opportunities for adults as well. Some hold mid-week Bible Study.christiAnitY: AnABAPtist\u00a9 NDIN 2014 v .1 v.1 \u00a9 NDIN 2014 Religious liteRacy PRimeR 23daily religious Practices Anabaptists are encouraged to pray daily, to engage in Bible study and to endeavor to live out Jesus' teachings in their daily lives. holy days/Festivals Christmas (commemoration of the birth of Jesus) and Easter (marking the resurrection of Jesus) are major holidays for Anabaptists. Some also observe Palm Sunday (the Sunday before Easter marking Jesus' entry into Jerusalem), Maundy Thursday (last Thursday before Easter; celebration of Jesus' last supper), and Good Friday (Friday before Easter; commemorating the crucifixion of Jesus). Pentecost (the celebration of the coming of the Holy Spirit on Jesus' followers) is recognized by all, and is a major celebration for some. A few Anabaptists follow a set liturgical calendar; most are more generally scripture-based rather than calendar-oriented. Thanksgiving Day (a U.S. national holiday) is celebrated by most Anabaptist churches. rituals/ceremonies Anabaptists churches maintain two characteristically Christian practices: Baptism and Communion/Lord's Supper. Anabaptist churches reserve baptism for adults or children who have reached \"the age of accountability.\" Anabaptists see baptism as part of testifying publicly that one has become a Christian by accepting Jesus Christ as one's Lord and Savior (or, as an act of obedience, now that one is a Christian). Some Anabaptists incorporate Communion/the Lord's Supper (a ritual involving the sharing of bread and cup \u2014 usually grape juice, not wine \u2014 into their regular Sunday worship once a month; others, once a quarter; still others, twice a year. dress (religious restrictions) Few Anabaptist denominations have clothing requirements for daily or Sunday clothing, except for modesty. The Amish and some other groups require head coverings for women at all times. In stressing modesty, a few insist that women must always wear a dress or skirt (never trousers). A few denominations or sects require women to cover their heads when attending worship, including the Amish, Old Order Mennonite and Conservative Mennonites. A very few denominations require women to wear a distinctive head-covering at all times, including the Amish, Old Order Mennonites, and some Conservative Mennonites. Some groups also have a distinctive comprehensive dress code for all members. For example, the Amish, Hutterites, Old German Baptist Brethren, and Old Order River Brethren all wear plain clothing. Amish men typically wear beards while Mennonite men do not. Fabrics worn by Mennonite women typically have patterns while Amish women typically wear plain fabrics. There is no standard attire for Anabaptist clergy. death: dying Practices Anabaptists generally prefer family or close friends to be at the bedside of a dying person; they may also find their pastor to be a reassuring companion at such a time. Reading of scripture (especially the Psalms) to the dying and saying of bedside prayers are common practices, as well as singing. Anabaptists have no essential end-of-life sacraments, although may request anointing.christiAnitY: AnABAPtist24 Religious liteRacy PRimeR \u00a9 NDIN 2014 v .1death: Body Preparation Most Anabaptists make use of a funeral home.

Funerals typically take place in churches, followed by burial in the church cemetery. Amish \"visitations\" are held in the home, possibly with a funeral at the meetinghouse and burial in the church cemetery. dietary laws and customs Anabaptists hold a wide range of attitudes; generalizations are unhelpful here. health (medical care) Attitudes in this category are wide-ranging. Generally, Anabaptists are comfortable with the full range of conventional medical treatment options. The Amish will typically opt for homeopathic treatments as well as conventional medicine. The Amish and some others do not buy health insurance. Most will not demand extraordinary means be taken to sustain life; most are quite comfortable to \"allow natural death.\" Some are comfortable with notions of organ transplantation; others are not. health (mental health) While some Anabaptists (Amish and more conservative Mennonites) believe that Bible study and prayer should be the first intervention for mental health problems most others will generally be comfortable with conventional medical treatment for mental and other health issues.

Founder(s) Decisive figures in the Anglican Reformation include Thomas Cranmer and Queen Elizabeth I of England. The role of King Henry VIII was primarily political. Following the American Revolution, the Anglican Church in America separated itself from the Church of England and was renamed the Episcopal Church with its governance restructured so that clergy were not required to accept the supremacy of the British monarch. Branches & denominations The Episcopal Church is the primary Anglican body in the U.S., but has a presence in some 15 other countries as well. Some dozen other bodies share the heritage and the name\u2014among them, the Reformed Episcopal Church. The Episcopal Church in the United States is part of the international Anglican Communion in a worldwide fellowship of self-governing churches with roots in the Church of England. Basic t enets Anglican Christianity defines itself as both Protestant and Reformed, a branch of Christianity in which scripture, reason, and tradition are given equal authority. In the U.S., Episcopalians: Believe in God as Triune, and in Jesus Christ to be God Incarnate, fully divine and fully human; the birth, ministry, death, and resurrection of Jesus are definitive. Encourage the baptism of infants and children, and considers the Baptismal Covenant as foundational to its Social Teachings. Consider the Eucharist the primary form of weekly communal worship. Believe the Church to be one, holy, catholic (universal), and apostolic. Believe in apostolic succession (ministry of the Church is derived from Jesus Christ's apostles by a continuous succession). The Episcopal church upholds seven sacraments: Baptism, Eucharist, Confession and Absolution, Holy Matrimony, Confirmation, Ordination, and Anointing of the Sick. sacred t exts Episcopalians (and other Anglicans in the U.S.) use the Christian Bible comprising an Old Testament of 39 Books and the New Testament's 27 books (as do Protestants), plus fourteen books found in Catholic and Orthodox Old Testaments, which are placed between the Old and New Testaments called the Apocrypha. Anglican Christians worship according to the Book of Common Prayer. For members of The Episcopal Church, the Hymnal 1979 is considered an auxiliary sacred text. Episcopal Shield 26 Religious liteRacy PRimeR \u00a9 NDIN 2014 v .1sacred Buildings/ structuresEpiscopalians call their worship site a \"church.\" For Episcopalians, a cathedral is a church which houses the bishop's chair (cathedra), and is central to the life of a diocese. The term parish is sometimes used to refer to a church's congregation or the congregation of a particular church. governance (Judicatory) Member churches of the Anglican Communion have various forms of governance. The General Convention (a bicameral body with a House of Bishops and a House of Deputies\u2014both lay and ordained) is the governing body of The Episcopal Church and meets every three years; between General Conventions, the Executive Council exercises oversight. At the pinnacle of the hierarchy of The Episcopal Church is the Presiding Bishop and Primate; each diocese is headed by a bishop, and may have several bishops. governance (congregation) Parishes (congregations) are administered by a Vestry (a panel of elected laypersons), the rector or priest-in-charge, and his or her staff. Some parishes are served by a deacon as well. Priests and deacons sometimes have non-parochial ministries. Point of contact Local: Local congregations are usually led by a rector; the senior warden may also be the point of contact. Regional: Bishop National: Presiding Bishop and Primate of The Episcopal Church religious leaders Lay people are considered leaders, serving as deputies and on vestries. Ordained leaders include deacons, priests, bishops, and others. When addressing Episcopal clergy, male priests are often called \"Father NAME.\" Women may be called \"Mother NAME,\" although since some dislike this practice, it is wise to inquire about preference. Bishops and deacons are addressed by their title: \"Bishop NAME\" or \"Deacon NAME.\" Archdeacons are called the Venerable. religious objects/symbols The symbol of the Anglican Communion is the Compass Rose, often encircled by the words \"The Truth Shall Set You Free\" in Greek. The symbol of The Episcopal Church is a white shield divided into four sections by a red cross; the background of the top, left-hand section is blue, upon which is placed white X (cross). Anglicans use both the crucifix and the empty cross. The altar is central to Anglican worship. Many Anglican churches have a lectern holding a Bible and a pulpit on opposite sides of the altar. Anglicans may make use of icons (stylized painting) or statues of Jesus, Mary, and various saints. They may make use of symbols representing specific saints, and other visual symbols in the d\u00e9cor of the worship space. Facilitating Practices Episcopalians will appreciate the presence of a priest. They usually welcome the opportunity to receive communion from a priest, deacon, or Lay Eucharistic Minister. culture & social interactionEpiscopalians hold a wide range of attitudes; generalizations are unhelpful here. gender roles/interaction While Anglicanism worldwide has a range of attitudes regarding gender roles, The Episcopal Church is generally egalitarian, with no gender qualifications for leadership roles or participation in worship. christiAnitY: Anglic An/ePiscoPAl\u00a9 NDIN 2014 v .1 Religious liteRacy PRimeR 27Principal Weekly observance(s)The principal weekly observance for many Episcopalians (and for many Anglicans worldwide) is the Eucharist (also called Mass or Holy Communion). daily religious Practices The Anglican Christian tradition provides the Daily Offices of Morning and Evening Prayer\u2014formal patterns with prescribed texts, a cycle of Bible readings to be incorporated, and opportunity for personal supplication - which can be performed anywhere by anyone. Many clergy in this tradition maintain this daily practice; so do many laypersons. Some Episcopalians receive communion daily. holy days/Festivals Episcopalians follow a liturgical calendar that begins with Advent (four Sundays prior to Christmas) and includes several major Feast Days, seasons of the church year (each distinguished by a particular focus and color for use in worship), and a list of commemorations of holy women and men. Major Holy Days include: Christmas Day (commemoration of the birth of Jesus). Epiphany (the recognition of Jesus by the Magi, followed by commemoration of Jesus' baptism and other manifestations of Jesus' divinity). Ash Wednesday (the beginning of Lent - a period of six weeks before Easter involving spiritual renewal through self-reflection, fasting, alms giving, and prayer). Palm Sunday (a feast Sunday before Easter marking Jesus' entry into Jerusalem). Maundy Thursday (last Thursday before Easter; celebration of Jesus' last supper). Good Friday (Friday before Easter; commemorating the crucifixion of Jesus). Easter (feast marking the resurrection of Jesus). Ascension (of Jesus into Heaven). Pentecost (the celebration of the receipt of the Holy Spirit by Jesus' followers, thus the beginning of the Church). In the U.S., some congregations celebrate \"Homecoming Sunday\" (usually in late summer; a time when people who have been away from the church return). Thanksgiving Day (a U.S. national holiday) is celebrated as a religious holiday by some Episcopal churches. rituals/ceremonies Episcopalianism maintains the two characteristically Christian practices: Baptism and Communion/Lord's Supper. Episcopalians believe that baptism makes an individual a full member of the Body of Christ (the Church). Many Episcopalians encourage the baptism of infants by sprinkling or pouring water on their head. Typically, Episcopalians partake of Holy Communion weekly, using bread (leavened or unleavened) and wine. Some make provision for mid-week or daily communion. Episcopalians interpret Communion sacramentally (i.e. they believe in the Real Presence of Jesus in the bread and the wine). dress (religious restrictions)There is no mandatory dress for Episcopal laity. Typically, Anglican clergy wear a black shirt and white clerical collar. Some Anglican priests choose to wear a tab collar (white only in front), resembling those worn by Catholic priests. Bishops wear a purple clerical shirt, collar, and pectoral cross outside their shirt. When celebrating Holy Eucharist, many Anglican clergy (especially in The Episcopal Church) wear elaborate vestments, similar to those of other leaders including those in the Roman Catholic and Orthodox Christian churches. When officiating at other services, they wear a black cassock with a white surplice (over-garment). christiAnitY: PRimeR \u00a9 NDIN 2014 v .1death: dying Practices The Book of Common Prayer provides liturgies and prayers for use with a person who is dying or who has just died.

Episcopalians may desire the sacrament of anointing as death approaches. death: Body Preparation Many Episcopalians make use of a funeral home. There are no universally mandated Episcopal practices regarding preparation of the body. Embalming is common, as is the holding of \"visitation\" at the funeral home on the evening preceding the funeral. An Episcopal funeral liturgy emphasizes belief in and expectation of resurrection; it may include Holy Communion, if the family wishes. It is customary for the funeral to be held in a church rather than a funeral home. The funeral includes rites to be performed later at the burial. Some Episcopalians (especially in the U.S.) request cremation rather than burial; some families may prefer a memorial service at some point after burial/cremation rather than a funeral. dietary laws and customs Few restrictions or requirements in this category, although some Episcopalians do maintain a fast during the season of Lent. health (medical care) Among Episcopalians, attitudes in this category are wide-ranging.

Full-time practitioners (healing ministers) are available for spiritual healing, which is uniquely different from medical or psychological techniques. religious objects/symbols The Christian Science seal features the cross passing diagonally through a jeweled crown, encircled by words from Matthew 10.8: \"Heal the Sick, Cleanse the Lepers, Raise the Dead, Cast Out Demons.\" Facilitating Practices Many Christian Scientists eschew conventional medical intervention, so will appreciate having their wishes respected. They will appreciate being given access to a Christian Science practitioner. culture & social interactionNothing of particular concern, except for the need for sensitivity when offering conventional Western medical treatment- and resulting family tension which sometimes arises if a Christian Scientist elects to accept medical procedures. gender roles/interaction Christian Science is egalitarian. Men and women have equal status. Principal Weekly observance(s)Sunday services feature instrumental music, singing, readings appointed for that week from the Bible and from Science and Health, a sermon based on those readings, and prayer. Wednesday evening testimony meetings feature scripture readings chosen by the First Reader to meet the needs of the particular congregation, prayer, and reports from attendees on healings and other insights gained during the week. daily religious Practice Observant Christian Scientists: Maintain daily study of a weekly Bible Lesson (a collection of topic-specific passages from the Bible and Science and Health). Maintain a routine of daily prayer as stipulated in Manual of The Mother Church by Mary Baker Eddy. holy days/Festivals Christian Scientists observe Christmas (commemoration of the birth of Jesus) and Easter (feast marking the resurrection of Jesus); they may also observe Thanksgiving Day (a U.S. national holiday). christiAnitY: christiAn science \u00a9 NDIN 2014 v .1 v.1 \u00a9 NDIN 2014 Religious liteRacy PRimeR 31rituals/ceremonies Christian Scientists speak of baptism and communion, but do not conduct the rituals implied by these terms in many other forms of Christianity: Christian Scientists do not perform water-baptism; rather, they understand baptism as an ongoing process of spiritual renewal. They may apply for a document certifying that they \"practice baptism daily by studying the Word of God and living their lives in a way that give evidence they are being bathed in Spirit and thus cleansed of sin.\" Christian Scientists observe the Sacrament of Communion twice yearly\u2014not by means of a ritual involving bread and wine/juice, but rather by kneeling in silent prayer as a congregation, followed by saying the Lord's Prayer in unison. dress (religious restrictions)No particular requirements or restrictions. death: dying Practices If a Christian Scientist has elected conventional Western medical treatment, their Christian Science practitioner will typically withdraw so as not to subject the patient to competing approaches. The patient and family may still appreciate privacy for daily prayers as death approaches. The Church of Christ, Scientist has no official position on organ donation; such decisions are an individual matter. death: Body Preparation Many Christian Scientists bury rather than cremate. The Church of Christ, Scientist has no official position on preparation of the body for burial. There is no mandated funeral ritual. Families are free to make their own plans. dietary laws and customs No restrictions; however, many Christian Scientists abstain from alcohol, tobacco, pharmaceutical medications, and illicit drugs; many abstain from coffee and tea. health (medical care) Every Christian Scientist is free to choose the form of healthcare he or she prefers. Many prefer to rely on prayer (their own or that of a Christian Science practitioner) for healing of adverse health conditions. Because of reliance on Christian Science practitioners rather than the conventional healthcare system, they may not be able to provide a conventionally documented medical history. Some may be willing to accept conventional medical treatment, but may be unfamiliar with terminology or procedures. While willing to accept certain conventional medical interventions, some may be reluctant to accept standard palliative treatment such as pain medication or IV fluids. Opting for conventional Western medical treatment may cause tension within or interrupt the Christian Science patient's social support network. health (mental health) As with physical healthcare, every Christian Scientist is free to choose the form of mental healthcare he or she prefers. Many will prefer to rely on prayer (their own or that of a Christian Science practitioner) for healing of adverse health conditions. Because of reliance on Christian Science practitioners rather than the conventional healthcare system, they may not be able to provide a conventionally documented medical history. Some may be willing to accept conventional medical treatment for mental illness, but may be unfamiliar with terminology or procedures.

When pregnant, a Christian Scientist may prefer the services of Christian Science practitioner and a midwife to standard OB-GYN care. They may plan for a home birth with a midwife, acknowledging the midwife's legal mandate to transfer the case to a hospital if complications arise. With regard to abortion, Christian Science trusts its members to use prayer to guide themselves to a solution that is right for them. As with other body-health issues, many Christian Scientists will prefer prayer over medical intervention. Christian Science also teaches that unwanted pregnancy is the result of societal problems awaiting spiritual healing. For service Providers Physical contact No restrictions. dietary restrictions No restrictions. medical t reatment When a Christian Scientist is taken to a hospital because of an accident but declines conventional medical treatment, this typically means that (as a competent adult) this individual is choosing to rely on prayer (individually, or with the help of a Christian Science practitioner) for healing. Such an individual will co-operate with authorities to take appropriate actions, such as quarantine, which may be considered necessary to protect others. Individuals relying on Christian Science practice may ask to be re-tested, or to have a pending procedure re-evaluated after having had time to pray for healing. If a Christian Scientist has entered a hospital voluntarily, it can be assumed that the individual will accept conventional medical treatment, but might ask that drugs/therapy be kept to a minimum. Individual Christian Scientists or their authorized proxies make their own decisions about blood transfusions and organ/tissue donation. mental health care If a Christian Scientist has entered a hospital voluntarily for mental healthcare, it can be assumed that the individual will accept conventional medical treatment, but might ask that drugs/therapy be kept to a minimum. mass care Facilities Support is best provided by: Providing time and a quiet space to pray.

U.s. Population 44,233,466 language (Worship) English (with some U.S. congregations worshiping in the language preferred by their local congregations.) Founder(s) Evangelicalism is a movement within Protestant Christianity. In addition to other figures that are part of the history of Protestant Christianity, important leaders in Evangelicalism include Jonathan Edwards, George Whitfield, Charles Wesley, Dwight Moody, and Billy Graham. Branches & denominations Church of Christ, Church of the Nazarene, Lutheran Church\u2014Missouri Synod, National Baptist, Salvation Army, Seventh Day Adventist, and Southern Baptist are some of the larger denominations within the Evangelical tradition. Many nondenom-inational churches are evangelical. Basic t enets As an umbrella term, Evangelicalism covers an enormous diversity of denominations and independent churches. Many evangelical churches are autonomous in their operation. The majority of Evangelicals believe: In an assertion of a personal relationship with God through Christ, study of the Bible by laypersons, freedom of conscience on many matters, and a variety in worship styles. That Jesus of Nazareth is considered God Incarnate. The birth, ministry, death, and resurrection of Jesus are definitive. In a Trinitarian understanding of the nature of God. That the Holy Spirit is important to all Evangelicals, but receives more emphasis from some than from others. sacred t exts The Christian Bible (comprising an Old Testament of 39 books and the 27 books of the New Testament) is foundational for all Evangelicals. Many interpret the Bible literally. Some insist on the King James Version; others prefer (or even require) more recent translations, at least for reading in public worship. sacred Buildings/ structuresMany Evangelicals call their worship site a \"church.\" Some call it a meetinghouse; a few call it a cathedral (but may not use it in the same way as Catholics and Anglicans do). It is common for church-buildings to have a steeple topped with a cross. Some Evangelicals meet in borrowed space (e.g. a school auditorium) or use a commercial space. Congregations can be small storefront churches or large-scale campuses with multiple buildings. governance (Judicatory) Some Evangelical churches are part of a hierarchical governing structure (e.g. the Evangelical Free Church; Southern Baptist Convention); others are part of a loose federation; still others are completely free-standing and independent. Christian Cross 34 Religious liteRacy PRimeR \u00a9 NDIN 2014 v .1governance (congregation) Many local congregations (even those of denominations with a robust regional or national governing structure) are self-governing. Often, local governance is in the hands of an elected committee. Point of contact Local: Local congregations are usually led by a pastor. Regional: Varies by denomination (sometimes a Bishop or judicatory body) National: Varies by denomination (usually a national judicatory body) religious leaders Common terms for Evangelical leaders include: minister, pastor, deacon, elder, bishop. Some Evangelicals use the term \"the Reverend\" as a noun meaning \"clergyperson\"; some use it only as an adjective. In some traditions, deacons are clergy; in others, the word refers to a temporary elected office. religious objects/symbols The cross is a major symbol for Evangelicals; the empty cross is generally used, rather than a crucifix, in order to emphasize the Risen Christ. The Bible itself may serve as a symbol. Many denominations have a distinguishing symbol or logo. Facilitating Practices Ask family what practices they turn to for support and provide privacy as needed. culture & social interactionSome Evangelicals are conservative on social issues; others are less so, some are liberal. gender roles/interaction Most Evangelical denominations and churches limit authority structures and leadership positions to men; some allow for leadership roles for women. Principal Weekly observance(s)Most Evangelicals gather weekly for communal worship involving singing, Bible readings, and a sermon. Many do this on Sunday mornings; a few (e.g. Seventh Day Adventists) meet on Saturday. Many hold Sunday School for children; some also provide Sunday morning educational opportunities for adults as well. Some hold (and may even expect all to attend) mid-week Bible Study. daily religious Practices Evangelical Christians are encouraged to pray daily and to engage in daily Bible study. holy days/Festivals Christmas (commemoration of the birth of Jesus) and Easter (marking the resurrection of Jesus) are major holidays for all Evangelicals. Some also observe Palm Sunday (Sunday before Easter marking Jesus' entry into Jerusalem), Maundy Thursday (last Thursday before Easter; celebration of Jesus' last supper), and Good Friday (Friday before Easter; commemorating the crucifixion of Jesus). Pentecost (the celebration of the coming of the Holy Spirit on Jesus' followers) is recognized by many, and is a major celebration for some. Some follow a liturgical calendar similar to Roman Catholic practice, thus observing the seasons of Advent (beginning four Sundays before Christmas) and Lent (a period of six weeks before Easter involving spiritual renewal through self-reflection, fasting, alms giving, and prayer). Some Evangelicals observe days related to their denominational history. Thanksgiving Day (a U.S. national holiday) is celebrated as a religious holiday by some Evangelical churches.christiAnitY: ev Angelic Al\u00a9 NDIN 2014 v .1 v.1 \u00a9 NDIN 2014 Religious liteRacy PRimeR 35rituals/ceremonies Many Evangelical churches maintain two characteristically Christian practices: Baptism and Communion/Lord's Supper. However, they can be sorted into several categories according to how they perform these rites and with what meaning. Many Evangelical churches reserve baptism for adults (or children who are old enough to choose their religion), and may characterize themselves as \"Born-Again Christians.\" Many Evangelicals see baptism as part of testifying publicly that one has become a Christian by accepting Jesus Christ as one's personal Lord and Savior (or, as an act of obedience, now that one is a Christian). Some Evangelicals incorporate Communion/the Lord's Supper (a ritual involving the sharing of bread and cup\u2014which for some contains wine, but for many contains grape juice) into their regular Sunday worship once a month; others, once a quarter; still others, once a year. A few Evangelical denominations do this weekly. dress (religious restrictions)Few Evangelical denominations have clothing requirements for daily or Sunday wear. In stressing modesty, a few insist that women must always wear a dress or skirt (never trousers). A few denominations or sects require women to cover their heads when attending worship, including the Apostolic Christian Church and some Pentecostal churches. This belief stems from 1 Corinthians 11, \"But every woman praying or prophesying with her head unveiled dishonors her head. For it is one and the same thing as if she were shaved. 6 For if a woman is not covered, let her also be shorn. But if it is shameful for a woman to be shorn or shaved, let her be covered.\" There is no standard attire for all Evangelical clergy. Many wear a business suit or other more casual street clothing; Others may wear academic robes. Evangelical choirs often wear robes or some other uniform when participating in worship. death: dying Practices Evangelicals usually prefer family or close friends to be at the bedside of a dying person; they may also find their pastor to be a reassuring companion at such a time. Reading of scripture (especially the Psalms) to the dying and saying of bedside prayers are common practices. Evangelicals have no essential end-of-life sacraments, although they may request anointing. death: Body Preparation Many Evangelicals make use of a funeral home. There are no universally mandated Evangelical practices regarding preparation of the body. Embalming is common, as is the holding of \"visitation\" at the funeral home on the evening preceding the funeral. Some hold a short funeral at the funeral home, then proceed immediately to burial or cremation. Some Evangelicals hold a church funeral (with the body present in a casket); some prefer a church memorial service several days (or longer) after the burial or cremation. Many Evangelicals bury their dead, although cremation has also become popular. christiAnitY: ev Angelic Al36 Religious liteRacy PRimeR \u00a9 NDIN 2014 v .1dietary laws and customs Evangelicals hold a wide range of attitudes; generalizations are unhelpful here. health (medical care) Attitudes in this category are wide-ranging. While these attitudes may be informed by Evangelical Christian faith, many denominations have no medical care policies that members must follow. Generally, Evangelical Christians are comfortable with the full range of conventional medical treatment options. Some will demand extraordinary means be taken to sustain life; others are quite comfortable to \"allow natural death.\" Some are comfortable with notions of organ transplantation; others are not. health (mental health) Many Evangelicals believe that Bible study and prayer alone instead of professional medical intervention can overcome mental health problems. They will generally be comfortable with conventional medical treatment for other health issues. Pregnancy and Birth Although abortion is generally opposed by many denominations of Evangelicals, there is no consensus on whether exceptions can be made and some do allow exceptions. For service Providers Physical contact No specific concerns or recommendations. Generalizations may not be helpful here. dietary restrictions With regard to many Evangelical Christians, none which are religiously mandated. Many may choose to avoid alcohol. medical t reatment No specific concerns or recommendations. Generalizations may not be helpful here. mental health care Many Evangelicals believe that Bible study and prayer alone instead of professional medical intervention can overcome mental health problems but others may be open to treatment by mental health professionals. mass care Facilities Evangelical Christians will appreciate being able to hold Sunday worship. Because of the wide range of theological and social attitudes, it may be necessary to allow for more than one Evangelical worship opportunity in a mass care situation. Evangelical Christians will appreciate opportunities to hold Bible study. christiAnitY: ev Angelic Al\u00a9 NDIN 2014 v .1 2014 Religious liteRacy PRimeR 37cHrIStIAnIty : JEHOVAH'S WItnESSES Adherents consider themselves christiAn.

Founder Charles Taze Russell (1879) Branches & denominations N/A Basic t enets As a millenialist, restorationist, nontrinitarian Christian movement which sees itself as the only true Christianity, it is distinctive in the following ways (among many others): Belief that the Bible (the Protestant canon of scriptures) is the inspired, inerrant word of God\u2014scientifically and historically accurate and reliable. Belief that Jehovah (or, Jehovah God) is the sole name for God. Belief that Jesus was executed on a stake (not a cross). Belief in a complex and unique understanding of death and the eventual End Times in which the world will be restored to a state of paradise; after which beneficiaries of Christ will be resurrected with healthy, perfected physical bodies and will inhabit the earth. Baptism must be by immersion after dedicating oneself to the movement's teachings; baptisms performed by other Christian denominations are not accepted. Refusal to participate in ceremonies such as saluting or pledging allegiance to a national flag, to celebrate birthdays or traditional Christian holidays, or to serve in the armed forces. Belief that acceptance of blood transfusions is a violation of certain scriptural edicts. Refusal to participate in interfaith networks or alliances due to the believe that the Bible warns against interfaith mixing and that differing religious beliefs cannot bond through interfaith. sacred t exts The Bible (the 66 books of Protestant canon).

It is responsible for formulating policy and doctrines, producing material for publications and conventions, and administering its worldwide branch office staff. governance (congregation) Each local congregation appoints a body of unpaid male elders and ministerial servants. Elders take responsibility for congregational governance, selection of leadership for meetings, oversight of public preaching, and so on; ministerial servants fill these roles as well, but can also teach and conduct meetings. Some teaching roles can be assumed by women.

However, the Watchtower (the publishing house and website of the movement) does have a distinctive logo. Facilitating Practices While Jehovah's Witnesses generally hold modern medicine and healthcare professionals in high regard, they maintain strong opposition to use of blood or blood products, based on their interpretation of certain Bible passages (Genesis 9.3, 4; Leviticus 17.10; Acts 15.28-29). Caregivers should take seriously the right of competent adult patients to refuse blood transfusions and blood products. When in doubt, and when possible, caregivers should consult a congregational elder or contact the local Jehovah Witnesses Hospital Liaison Committee. culture & social interactionModesty in dress is encouraged. In families, the husband is the primary authority. gender roles/interaction While women and men are considered equal, and all baptized Jehovah's Witnesses are considered ordained ministers, some roles are limited to men. Women are commonly appointed as full-time ministers, whether to evangelize as \"pioneers\" or \"missionaries, or to serve at their branch offices. Within the congregation, a female minister may only lead prayer and teaching when there is a special need, and must do so wearing a head covering. Ministerial servants and elders must be male; only a baptized adult male may perform a Jehovah's Witness baptism, funeral, or wedding. Principal Weekly observance(s)Congregations meet twice weekly (mid-week and weekends) for multi-session meetings involving the study of the Bible and Jehovah's Witness literature, singing, and prayer. Certain meetings are held in homes. Regular house-to-house visitation and preaching is part of their practice. daily religious Practices Prayer and Bible study, facilitated by Jehovah's Witness literature and study aids. holy days/Festivals Jehovah's Witnesses commemorate \"the Lord's Evening Meal\" or \"Memorial of Christ's Death\" on a date coinciding with Jewish Passover.

Jehovah's Witnesses often carry on their person an Advance Medical Directive/ Release document directing that no blood transfusions be given under any circumstances, and this document is renewed annually. A more detailed Health-Care Advance Directive form outlining their personal treatment choices may also be carried. Jehovah's Witness are generally amenable to sign hospital forms that direct that no allogeneic blood transfusion or primary blood components be administered under any circumstances, while releasing doctors, medical personnel, and hospitals from liability for any damages that might result from such refusal (despite otherwise competent care). They understand the challenge that their decisions can sometimes pose for doctors and nurses. In an effort to alleviate these situations, they have established a network of Hospital Liaison Committees whose members are trained to facilitate communication between medical staff and Jehovah's Witness patients. This service is available at any time to assist with difficulties, either at the request of the treating team or the patient. mental health care No specific requirements. mass care Facilities Preference for modesty may result in preference for privacy. christiAnitY: NDIN 2014 Religious liteRacy PRimeR 41cHrIStIAnIty : MOrMOnISM Adherents consider themselves christiAn.

Smaller breakaway and reform denominations (which differ in governance and some points of belief and practice) do exist, both to the right and the left of the mainstream. Basic t enets This religion derives from revelations received by Joseph Smith in upstate New York, and set out in The Book of Mormon. It embraces many distinctive beliefs and practices. It sees itself as restoring the primitive Church of the New Testament, and teaches a form of apostolic succession. It teaches that God (often called Heavenly Father), who is omniscient, has a material body. It is centered on Jesus Christ as the firstborn of God, and teaches substitution- ary atonement through Christ. It teaches as well about the Holy Ghost (or Holy Spirit), but its explanation of the nature and interrelationship of Heavenly Father, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost differs significantly from Trinitarian Christianity. Whereas many Christian traditions believe in the Trinity (that God, Jesus and the Holy Spirit are one substance), Mormons believe God the Father, Jesus and the Holy Spirit are separate beings. Members are believed to be literal spiritual sons and daughters of a living Father in Heaven.

Individuals make their own decisions regarding medical treatment, but may consult with their personal \"home teacher\" some other church elder, in addition to their physicians and family. Allow for visits by church representatives; privacy for prayer or ritual (anointing; communion). culture & social interactionAlthough Mormon individuals and families are advised to be prepared spiritually and temporally to meet both problems of everyday life and emergencies that may arise, local church leaders have the responsibility to organize proper responses to assist individuals and families in an emergency. Local churches are encouraged to prepare detailed emergency preparedness and response plans, based on principles contained in Providing in the Lord's Way. Branch Welfare Committees are identified as the coordinators if disaster strikes. gender roles/interaction While church leadership is limited to men, women and men are said to be equal in God's eyes. Marriage is considered eternal, with families expecting to be reunited in the hereafter. Principal Weekly observance(s)A \"sacrament meeting\" is the normative weekly form of worship on Sundays. It includes songs, prayer, distribution of individual portions of sacramental bread and water, talks by young people plus a sermon by an adult lay leader, and a benediction. Mormons also observe family home evenings in which an evening is set aside for family bonding, study, prayer and other wholesome activities on a weekly basis.

Two elders required for ritual of blessing for sick. dress (religious restrictions)Observant Mormons wear a sacred undergarment with short sleeves and knee-length legs, which is to be kept out of sight. Hospitalized Mormons are excused from wearing it. Patients who wish to wear it nevertheless will appreciate being provided with hospital pants as well as a gown. death: dying Practices Strong Mormon belief in glorious life after death can facilitate a peaceful, dignified death. Blessing of the sick may be requested. In this rite, two elders of the church anoint the head of the sick person with consecrated olive oil, and say a special prayer for healing while laying hands upon the patient's head. When a patient or the patient's family requests the Mormon rite of blessing of the sick, a quiet, private place should be provided, or an effort made to provide privacy in the hospital room. Mormons believe that, at death, the individual's eternal spirit separates from the body, returns to God, and is reunited with others known before. Therefore, family members may ask the dying person to carry messages to deceased loved ones. When dying has become inevitable, the church does not require \"unreasonable means\" be taken, but does oppose active euthanasia. Mormon patients and their families may be comfortable with DNR (Do Not Resuscitate) orders. Mormons may practice \"baptism for the dead,\" or posthumous proxy baptisms of deceased ancestors by living volunteers. death: Body Preparation Organ donation is an individual choice. Church or family members will usually arrange for the body of a faithful Mormon to be clothed in temple ritual attire for burial. Burial recommended over cremation, but the decision is left to the family. Autopsy is permitted. dietary laws and customs Observant LDS members abstain from alcoholic, caffeinated beverages, and tobacco; they are encouraged to consume wholesome herbs, fruits within season, and grains; consumption of meat should be moderate.

They believe that all of life can be sacramental\u2014filled with God's Holy Spirit by God's grace\u2014but that this divine action is made clear through the Holy Mysteries of baptism, chrismation (anointing with oil after baptism), Eucharist, penance, marriage, holy unction (anointing for healing and forgiveness), and holy orders (ordination of clergy). Orthodox believe that the Holy Tradition of the Church is continued through the Bible, the Nicene Creed (dating from the 4th century), icons (stylized paintings of Jesus, Mary, and saints), the decrees of the Ecumenical Councils, the Liturgy (patterns of worship), and the writings of the early Christian scholars. sacred t exts Orthodox Bible, a larger collection of writings than Bibles used by other Christians, with 49 or more books in the Old Testament, but the same New Testament (27 books) found in Bibles used by other Christians. The total number of books of the Bible varies slightly from one branch of Orthodox Christianity to another. Icons (stylized paintings of Jesus, Mary, and saints) are said to be \"written\" (rather than \"painted\"), thus are considered sacred \"texts.\" The Nicene Creed and the decrees of the Ecumenical Councils are authoritative documents.Orthodox Cross 46 Religious liteRacy PRimeR \u00a9 NDIN 2014 v .1sacred Buildings/ structuresChurch architecture symbolizes the relationship between God and creation. The sanctuary (the area behind the icon screen) is sacred space. Cathedrals are churches that are also the seat of a jurisdiction (a diocese or archdiocese). Churches are local houses of worship. The term parish is sometimes used to refer to a church's congregation or the congregation of a particular church. Monasteries and convents house monks and nuns (respectively), and may also include a chapel and areas for instruction or work. They may have guest space as well. governance (Judicatory) Orthodox Church branches are self-headed, each with its own patriarch. The ecumenical patriarch of Constantinople (Istanbul) is recognized as the \"first among equal\" Orthodox bishops. All Orthodox Christians acknowledge his spiritual leadership. The patriarch of Constantinople also oversees the Greek Archdiocese of America and certain other Orthodox bodies. The Orthodox Church in America (OCA) is governed by the Holy Synod of Bishops (all diocesan bishops). The head of the synod is the Metropolitan of All-America and Canada. Archdioceses, Metropolises, and Dioceses are administrative districts led by a bishop who oversees local churches in that jurisdiction. governance (congregation) Oversight of a local congregation falls to the priest and his staff. A council of congregation-members may also provide oversight and leadership. Point of contact Local: Congregation (sometimes called \"parish\"), led by a priest and staff Regional: Diocese/Archdiocese/Metropolis, led by Bishop (or Metropolitan or Archbishop) National: For the Orthodox Church in America, the Metropolitan. For Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America, the Archbishop. (Other Orthodox churches have their own U.S. heads.) religious leaders Orthodox Christian leadership is hierarchical. A Patriarch is an international head, considered first among equal bishops in his jurisdiction. Regional leadership falls to bishops (or archbishops or metropolitans). Priests and deacons provide sacramental and spiritual leadership; priests often are in charge of a local parish (congregation). Orthodox leadership also includes many deacons, monks, nuns, and laypersons (some in positions of great importance). religious objects/symbols Three-bar cross; crucifix. Bible.

Principal Weekly observance(s)The Divine Liturgy (which includes Holy Communion) is the principal weekly observance. daily religious Practices Orthodox Christianity encourages daily prayer and meditation, spiritual reading, and a desire to put into practice God's will in one's daily live. Orthodox Christians fast on Wednesdays and Fridays, plus four extended periods: Great Lent (the seven weeks before Pascha). Nativity Fast (40 days, November 15 th through December 24th). Fast of the Apostles (from the Monday eight days after Pentecost until June 28th \u2014the Feast of Saints Peter and Paul). Dormition Fast (August 1st-14th, in honor of death of the Virgin Mary). Fasting involves abstinence from red meat, poultry, meat products, eggs, dairy products, fish, oil, and wine\u2014with provision for eating some of these items on certain days during the long fasting periods. A spiritual guide may also grant other exemptions. December 24 th is a strict fast. holy days/Festivals Orthodox Christians live by an annual calendar marked by twelve Great Feasts, and specific liturgical seasons (each with its own emphasis). This calendar begins in mid-November with the Nativity Fast, and includes many holidays\u2014some of which are observed by other Christians. Orthodox Christians also observe a calendar of saint's days. Some of the major Orthodox Christian holidays (also observed by many Christian denominations) include: The Nativity of Christ (Christmas): a celebration of birth of Jesus as God Incarnate. Epiphany (12 days after the Nativity): a time of blessing of homes with holy water to recall Jesus' baptism. The entry of Jesus into Jerusalem (Palm Sunday): one week before Pascha. Great and Holy Friday: commemoration of the death of Christ on the Cross, beginning with worship on Thursday evening and concluding with Vespers on Friday afternoon. Pascha: This ritual, preceded by a Vigil on Saturday evening which continues until dawn, celebrates the resurrection of Jesus from the dead. Pentecost: commemorating the receipt of the Holy Spirit by the nascent Christian community, fifty days after Jesus' Resurrection.christiAnitY: orthodox48 Religious liteRacy PRimeR \u00a9 NDIN 2014 v .1rituals/ceremonies Orthodox Christians observe many ritual practices, some of which are considered sacraments (outward and visible signs of inward and spiritual divine grace). These include: Baptism: makes one a member of the Body of Christ. Chrismation (also known as Confirmation): anointing with oil through which a baptized person is granted the gift of the Holy Spirit; normally combined with baptism. For converts who were baptized in other branches of Christianity, this is the entry rite to membership in the Orthodox Church. Eucharist/Holy Communion: a ritual meal of consecrated bread and wine, which Orthodox Christians believe has become, through the power of the Holy Spirit, the Precious Body and Blood of Jesus Christ. Confession. Holy Anointing: anointing with oil for the provision of spiritual and physical healing; administered universally during Hoy Week, but available at any time\u2014especially for the seriously ill. Matrimony: sanctification of the contract of a Christian marriage. Ordination: imposition of hands by a bishop, which confers on a candidate the ability to sanctify others through the holy and proper administration of the sacraments. dress (religious restrictions)Mandated attire for laypersons in the U.S. is unlikely; while head covering at worship for women is the norm in Orthodox Christianity, it is often dispensed within U.S. parishes. Clergy, monks, and nuns usually wear identifying garb. Clergy may wear traditional long black robe (cassock) or a black suit with a black shirt and white circular collar, but sometimes appear in secular settings in street clothes. Clergy don ceremonial clothing when conducting services. Monks and nuns wear distinctive identifying garments (habits). christiAnitY: orthodox\u00a9 NDIN 2014 v .1 v.1 \u00a9 NDIN 2014 Religious liteRacy PRimeR 49death: dying Practices While the Orthodox Church has a high regard for the preservation and dignity of life (including the life of the sick, disabled, and unborn) it does not obligate its members to seek or agree to gravely burdensome or ineffective life-sustaining interventions. Analgesics may be used in sufficient amounts to relieve pain, even if life is thereby shortened, so long as hastening death is not the intended effect. Orthodox Christians believe in life after death. The Sacrament of Anointing is very important when an Orthodox Christian is ill; the full liturgy of anointing is quite solemn and elaborate, with seven priests participating; an abbreviated form is used in an emergency. When death is imminent, the Sacrament of Confession may also be requested. Families will request the presence of a priest. Orthodox Christians believe that a child who dies unbaptized is in God's hands; they are not concerned for the safety of the child's soul. While it is, therefore, not necessary, Orthodox Christian families may, however, request an emergency baptism for a child whose life is in danger. This is seen as a fitting additional blessing. If no priest is available, the local bishop should be called for advice on how to proceed. In the case of a stillbirth, the Orthodox Church provides an order of service with specific prayers. When an Orthodox Christian approaches death, a priest is to be notified, and he will perform the Office of the Parting of the Soul from the Body. This rite includes portions for the dying person to say in his or her voice (when possible). While this rite is intended to end when the person has died; the priest then says the Prayer After Death. When necessary, the priest may make one or more visits to the dying person after performing the Office of the Parting of the Soul from the Body. death: Body Preparation The body of the deceased is to be treated with respect. Autopsy and organ donation are acceptable. Orthodox families may make funeral arrangements with their local parish and funeral home. The normal practice is to plan a morning funeral service with a wake the evening before. An open casket is the norm in an Orthodox funeral. Family and friends will gather after the service to pay respect to the family of the deceased. Cremation is not permitted. Embalming is permitted. However, some parishes are reclaiming the responsibility of preparing the body for burial. dietary laws and customs Many Orthodox Christians take very seriously the fasting customs of the church, which involve abstinence from red meat, poultry, meat products, eggs, dairy products, fish, oil, and wine\u2014with provision for eating some of these items on certain days during the long fasting periods. The sick, the elderly, and pregnant or nursing women may be excused from the requirements of the fast. Some Orthodox Christians such as members of the Ethiopian Church do not eat pork products.christiAnitY: orthodox50 Religious liteRacy PRimeR \u00a9 NDIN 2014 v .1health (medical care) Many Orthodox Christians will be open to conventional and state-of-the-art medical procedures. Use of blood or blood products is acceptable. During illness, Orthodox Christians may receive spiritual strength by availing themselves of sacraments: Anointing; Confession; Eucharist (Holy Communion). If the patient is able to receive food or liquid by mouth, Eucharist (Holy Communion) can be brought to the patient. If the patient is restricted from taking food or liquid by mouth, another rite or sacrament may be administered. Orthodox Christians may practice daily prayer when hospitalized. They may wish to have an icon available on their bed-stand. There may be a desire to have such items accompany the patient into surgery. Care should be taken so that such devotional items do not get lost. They may wish to have a small prayer book at their bedside. They often wear a cross around their neck that should not be removed unless absolutely necessary. Orthodox Christians have their own networks of pastoral and social services. health (mental health) No objection to normative mental health practices and treatment. Pregnancy and Birth Orthodox Christians hold a variety of attitudes toward birth control. There is an opportunity for prayer at the birth, certainly during the first day (for the child and the mother); another set for the eighth day and again at the fortieth day. Usually, a priest performs these; if no priest is available, the local bishop should be contacted. Orthodox Christianity opposes abortion except in cases where the life of the mother is in jeopardy. For service Providers Physical contact No specific requirements. dietary restrictions Generally, no specific requirements, except during fasting seasons. medical t reatment Generally accepting of all conventional and state-of-the-art medical care. mental health care Generally accepting of standard care. mass care Facilities Access to a priest will be appreciated. Provision should be made for the celebration of Divine Liturgy on Sundays. Beyond this, no specific requirements. Ethnically, Orthodoxy is a highly diverse branch of Christianity, and this diversity is intense in the U.S. context. Many U.S. Orthodox Christians speak English, but some will be more skilled in some other language; possibilities include Greek and Russian, but there are many others. christiAnitY: orthodox\u00a9 NDIN 2014 v .1 v.1 \u00a9 NDIN 2014 Religious liteRacy PRimeR 51cHrIStIAnIty : pEntEcOSt ALISM Adherents consider themselves christiAn.

Basic t enets As an umbrella term, Pentecostalism covers a large diversity of denominations and independent churches. Many Pentecostal churches are autonomous in their operation. The majority of Pentecostals believe: In a personal relationship with God through Christ, in the importance of study of the Bible by laypersons, in freedom of conscience on many matters, and a variety in worship styles. Jesus of Nazareth is considered God Incarnate. The birth, ministry, death, and resurrection of Jesus are definitive. Pentecostals are Trinitarian in their understanding of the nature of God. The Holy Spirit is of primary importance to all Pentecostals, and can dwell in the individual, often giving them particular \"gifts\" such as prophecy and healing. Many believe in the power of the Holy Spirit to impart miraculous healing through the work of those who are under his power. sacred t exts The Christian Bible (comprising an Old Testament of 39 Books and the 27 books of the New Testament) is foundational for all Pentecostal. Many interpret the Bible literally. Some insist on the King James Version; others prefer (or even require) more recent translations, at least for reading in public worship. sacred Buildings/ structuresMany Pentecostals call their worship-site a \"church.\" Some call it a meetinghouse; a few call it a cathedral (but may not use it in the same manner as Catholics and Anglicans do). It is common for church-buildings to have a steeple topped with a cross. Some Pentecostals meet in borrowed space (e.g. a school auditorium) or use a commercial space. Congregations can be small storefront churches or large-scale campuses with multiple buildings. governance (Judicatory) Some Pentecostals churches are part of a hierarchical governing structure (e.g. the Assemblies of God or Church of God in Christ); others are part of a loose federation; still others are completely free-standing and independent.

Facilitating Practices Ask family what practices they support and provide privacy as needed. culture & social interactionSome Pentecostals are conservative on social issues; others are less so; few are liberal. gender roles/interaction Most Pentecostal denominations and churches limit their authority structure and leadership roles to men; some allow for leadership roles for women. Principal Weekly observance(s)Most Pentecostals gather weekly for communal worship involving singing, Bible readings, and a sermon. Many do this on Sunday mornings; a few meet on Saturday. Many hold Sunday school for children; some also provide Sunday morning educational opportunities for adults as well. Some hold (and may even expect all to attend) mid-week Bible Study. daily religious Practices Pentecostal Christians are encouraged to pray daily and to engage in daily Bible study. holy days/Festivals Christmas (commemoration of the birth of Jesus) and Easter (feast marking the resurrection of Jesus) are major holidays for all Pentecostal Christians. Some also observe Palm Sunday (a feast Sunday before Easter marking Jesus' entry into Jerusalem), Maundy Thursday (last Thursday before Easter; celebration of Jesus' last supper), and Good Friday (Friday before Easter; commemorating the crucifixion of Jesus). Pentecost (the celebration of the receipt of the Holy Spirit by Jesus' followers) is recognized by many, and is a major celebration for some. Some follow a liturgical calendar similar to Roman Catholic practice, thus observing the seasons of Advent (beginning four Sundays before Christmas) and Lent (a period of six weeks before Easter involving spiritual renewal through self-reflection, fasting, alms giving, and prayer). Some Pentecostal Christians observe days related to their denominational history. Thanksgiving Day (a U.S. national holiday) is celebrated as a religious holiday by some Pentecostal churches.christiAnitY: Pentecost Alism\u00a9 NDIN 2014 v .1 PRimeR 53christiAnitY: Pentecost Alism rituals/ceremonies Many Pentecostal churches maintain two characteristically Christian practices: Baptism and Communion/Lord's Supper. However, they can be sorted into several categories according to how they perform these rites and with what meaning. Many Pentecostal churches reserve baptism for adults (or children who are old enough to choose their religion), and may characterize themselves as \"Born-Again Christians.\" Many Pentecostals see baptism as part of testifying publicly that one has become Christian by accepting Jesus Christ as one's personal Lord and Savior (or, as an act of obedience, now that one is Christian). Some Pentecostals incorporate Communion/the Lord's Supper (a ritual involving the sharing of bread and cup\u2014which for some contains wine, but for many contains grape juice) into their regular Sunday worship once a month; others, once a quarter; still others, once a year. A few Pentecostal denominations do this weekly. dress (religious restrictions)Few Pentecostal denominations have clothing requirements for daily or Sunday clothing. In stressing modesty, a few insist that women must always wear a dress or skirt (never trousers). A few denominations or sects require women to cover their heads when attending worship, for example the Church of Our Lord Jesus Christ of the Apostolic Faith, The Pentecostal Mission, the Deeper Christian Life Ministry, and the Christian Congregation in the United States; the Plymouth Brethren; and the more conservative Scottish Presbyterian and Dutch Reformed churches. This belief stems from 1 Corinthians 11, \"But every woman praying or prophesying with her head unveiled dishonors her head. For it is one and the same thing as if she were shaved. 6 For if a woman is not covered, let her also be shorn. But if it is shameful for a woman to be shorn or shaved, let her be covered.\" A very few require women to wear a distinctive head-covering at all times, and may also have a distinctive comprehensive dress code for all members. There is no standard attire for all Pentecostal clergy. Many wear a business suit or other more casual street clothing; some may wear academic robes. Pentecostal choirs often wear robes or some other uniform when participating in worship. death: dying Practices Pentecostals usually prefer family or close friends to be at the bedside of a dying person; they may also find their pastor to be a reassuring companion at such a time. Reading of scripture (especially the Psalms) to the dying and saying of bedside prayers are common practices. Pentecostals have no essential end-of-life sacraments, although may request anointing. death: Body Preparation Many Pentecostals make use of a funeral home. There are no universally mandated Pentecostal practices regarding preparation of the body. Embalming is common, as is the holding of \"visitation\" at the funeral home on the evening preceding the funeral. Some hold a short funeral at the funeral home, and then proceed immediately to burial or cremation. Some Pentecostals hold a church funeral (with the body present in a casket); some prefer a church memorial service several days (or longer) after the burial or cremation. Many Pentecostals bury their dead, although cremation has become popular. 54 Religious liteRacy PRimeR \u00a9 NDIN 2014 v .1dietary laws and customs Few restrictions or requirements in this category. health (medical care) Attitudes in this category are wide-ranging.

Doctrinal authority founded in the Bible and the actions of the seven Ecumenical Councils of the early church. Thus the Nicene Creed and the Chalcedonian Definition express official doctrine. The Roman Catholic Church maintains: Belief in Jesus Christ as God Incarnate; Trinitarian understanding of the nature of God. Belief in apostolic succession (direct, continuous descent of leadership from Jesus' apostles to the present), in the headship of the Pope in Rome, and in the threefold ministry of bishops, priests, and deacons. Strong liturgical tradition. Emphasis on the necessity and efficacy of seven Holy Sacraments, including baptism, Eucharist, prayers for the sick, marriage, confirmation and confession/penance, and holy orders/ordination. Belief in transubstantiation, the notion that during the ritual of the Eucharist, the elements of bread and wine become the actual body and blood of Christ. Emphasis on the veneration of Mary, the Mother of Jesus, and of the saints. sacred t exts Roman Catholic Bible (73 books, the Old Testament including 46, whereas the Protestant Old Testament has only 39)\u2014with preferred translations being the New American Bible and the New Jerusalem Bible. The Missal is the worshiper's guide during the Eucharist. The Apostles' Creed and the Nicene Creed are authoritative documents incorporated into orders of worship. sacred Buildings/ structures Basilicas are large churches. Cathedrals are churches that are also the seat of a geographic bishop's jurisdiction (a diocese or archdiocese). Churches are local houses of worship. The term parish is sometimes used to refer to a church's congregation or the congregation of a particular church. Monasteries and convents house monks and nuns (respectively), and may also include a chapel and areas for instruction or work.

U.S. Catholic Conference of Bishops is the seat of administration for U.S. Catholics nationally. Its offices are in Washington, D.C. Archdioceses and Dioceses are administrative districts lead by a bishop and oversee local parishes in that geographic area. Some Roman Catholic institutions and orders fall outside the supervision of these bodies of governance. governance (congregation) A local congregation is called a parish. Oversight may fall entirely to the pastor and his staff; it may fall, on the other hand, to an elected Parish Council. Point of contact Local: Parish, led by a priest and staff Regional: Diocese/Archdiocese, led by Bishop, Archbishop or Cardinal National: U.S. Catholic Conference of Bishops under jurisdiction of a Pope religious leaders Roman Catholic leadership is hierarchical. Ordained leadership roles are limited to men. Women can serve as nuns, sisters, or have other leadership opportunities. A Pope is the international head; under certain circumstances, his pronouncements are considered infallible. Regional leadership falls to archbishops and bishops. Priests and deacons provide sacramental and spiritual leadership at all levels; many are in charge of a local parish (congregation). Cardinals are priests (usually bishops) specially designated to become part of an advisory council \"college\" to the Pope. The also elect popes. Monsignor is an honorific title conferred upon some priests. Catholic leadership also includes many monks and nuns. Some U.S. parishes have lay administrators who perform many of the duties and take on many of the roles once the exclusive domain of clergy. Brothers and Sisters are non-ordained (lay) leaders who have usually taken a vow of poverty, celibacy, and obedience and often live an active vocation of both prayer and service. religious objects/symbols Crucifix; cross Bible Rosary (prayer beads) The Seven Sacraments Paintings and statues of Jesus, the Blessed Virgin Mary, various Saints Various symbols (e.g. the Holy Water, Sacred Heart of Jesus) Facilitating Practices A Roman Catholic priest, deacon, or specially trained and authorized layperson should be summoned to perform the rite of anointing for a sick or dying person when requested. Some Roman Catholics refuse visitation by clergy or chaplains who are not Roman Catholic; others will accept such visits, but for prayer or quiet conversation only. gender roles/interaction While church leadership is limited to men, women and men are said to be equal in God's eyes. christiAnitY: romAn c Atholicism\u00a9 NDIN 2014 v .1 \u00a9 NDIN 2014 Religious liteRacy PRimeR 61Principal Weekly observance(s)Roman Catholics are obliged to attend Mass Saturday or Sunday and receive Holy Communion once yearly (called \"Easter Duty\", and one of the laws of the Church). Holy Communion may be received more frequently (up to once daily). The sacrament of confession is required for sins classified as \"mortal\" sins. While some take the sacrament weekly, for many it is celebrated on a less frequent basis. daily religious Practices Roman Catholicism encourages daily prayer and meditation, spiritual reading, and a desire to put into practice God's will in one's daily live. Common daily practices include praying the Rosary, Liturgy of the Hours, and Stations of the Cross to name just a few. Some Catholics attend Mass daily. holy days/Festivals Roman Catholics follow an annual calendar that divides the year into liturgical seasons (each with its own emphasis and colors to be used in adorning the worship space). This calendar begins in late November or early December with Advent, and includes many holidays\u2014some of which are observed by other Christians, others of which are peculiar to Roman Catholics (e.g. the Feast of Our Lady of Guadalupe, which celebrates the Virgin Mary as the mother of the Americas). This calendar also pairs many days of the year with a saint who is to be honored on that day. Some major Roman Catholic holidays (also observed by many Christian denominations) include: Christmas: a celebration of birth of Jesus as God Incarnate. Ash Wednesday: the beginning of the Lenten season. Holy Week: leads up to Easter; begins with Palm/Passion Sunday, recalling Jesus' return to Jerusalem; includes Holy Thursday (recalling Jesus' institution of the practice of Holy Communion during his last meal with his disciples; observance may include ceremonial foot-washing of parishioners the feet as Christ did at \"The Last Supper\") and Good Friday (recalling Jesus' crucifixion). Easter Sunday: The most important point in the Christian year celebrating the resurrection of Jesus from the dead. Pentecost: commemorating the receipt of the Holy Spirit by the nascent Christian community, fifty days after Jesus' Resurrection; considered the birthday of the Church rituals/ceremonies Roman Catholics observe many ritual practices, the most important of which are considered sacraments (outward and visible signs of inward and spiritual divine grace). These include: Baptism: mitigates original sin and makes one a member of the Body of Christ. Confirmation: by which a Catholic receives the Holy Spirit and becomes an adult m ember of the Church. Eucharist: a ritual meal, often called Mass, during which Catholics believe the bread and wine are transformed into the actual Body and Blood of Christ. Reconciliation: involves the confession and forgiveness of sins. Matrimony: sanctification of the contract of a Christian marriage. Holy Orders: imposition of hands by a bishop, which confers on a candidate the ability to sanctify others through the holy and proper administration of the sacraments. Anointing (Sacrament of the Sick): a ritual for healing; sometimes still called \"Last Rites\", but which may be performed at times and for reasons other than imminent death. christiAnitY: romAn c Atholicism62 Religious liteRacy PRimeR \u00a9 NDIN 2014 v .1dress (religious restrictions)No mandated attire for lay persons. Clergy, monks, and nuns may wear identifying garb called habits required by their \"order\" (leadership). Clergy often wear a black suit with a black shirt and white circular collar, but sometimes appear in street clothes. Clergy don ceremonial clothing when conducting services. Some monks and nuns wear distinctive identifying garments (habits). death: dying Practices While the Roman Catholic Church has a high regard for the preservation and dignity of life (including the life of the sick, disabled, and unborn) it does not obligate its members to seek or agree to gravely burdensome or ineffective life-sustaining interventions. Analgesics may be used in sufficient amounts to relieve pain, even if life is thereby shortened, so long as hastening death is not the intended effect. Roman Catholics believe in life after death. Because a priest is viewed as an intermediary between the believer and God, and one whose prayers have special merit, a priest is often requested at the time of death. Sacrament of the Sick (Anointing) is very important, especially when death is imminent; the Sacrament of Reconciliation may also be requested. Even when all sacramental care has been provided earlier, families may request the presence of a priest when death is imminent. Roman Catholic families may request an emergency baptism for a child whose life is in danger. Any chaplain (or even a nurse or a parent) can baptize in an emergency. When someone other than a Roman Catholic clergyman performs an emergency baptism, the Roman Catholic chaplain or local parish should be notified so that the baptism can be registered in the local parish and a certificate can be issued. While the deceased are not baptized, a family sometimes requests baptism of a stillborn infant or miscarried fetus; typically, a Roman Catholic chaplain will provide a naming ritual and a prayer of commendation. death: Body Preparation The body of the deceased is to be treated with respect. Autopsy and organ donation are acceptable. Roman Catholic families may make funeral arrangements with their local parish and funeral home; this and usually includes plans for a wake. The timing and style of the wake varies with the ethnicity of the deceased. The funeral traditionally is held in a Catholic church, and may include a Mass. Family and friends will gather after the service to pay respect to the family of the deceased. Burial is preferred. The body is embalmed and prepared for burial services Roman Catholics may wish that an amputated limb be buried in consecrated ground. dietary laws and customs Many Roman Catholics take very seriously laws of fasting and abstinence, refraining from eating meat on certain days and to limiting the quantity of food on other days. During the season of Lent, Roman Catholics are required to abstain from eating meat on Fridays, but may eat fish. christiAnitY: romAn c Atholicism\u00a9 NDIN 2014 v .1 v.1 \u00a9 NDIN 2014 Religious liteRacy PRimeR 63health (medical care) Many Roman Catholics will be open to conventional and state-of-the-art medical procedures.

During an illness, Roman Catholics may receive spiritual strength by availing themselves of sacraments: Sacrament of the Sick (anointing with oil by a priest), which is no longer limited to \"Last Rites.\" Sacrament of Reconciliation, which involves confessing one's sins to a priest in order to experience God's love and forgiveness, to resolve personal issues, or to prepare for death. The confidentiality of a confession to a priest is protected legally; medical personnel will want to facilitate the patient's privacy for this. Eucharist (Holy Communion), which can be brought to the patient, if attending Mass is not possible. If the patient is restricted from taking food or liquid by mouth, the consecrated wafer may be touched to the patient's lips instead. Catholics may practice daily prayer when hospitalized. Roman Catholics may wish to have a rosary or an image of Jesus, the Virgin Mary, a favorite saint, or a vial of Holy Water. There may be a desire to have such items accompany the patient into surgery. Roman Catholics often wear a scapular (a small picture of Mary, Jesus, a saint, angel, or other mystical symbol) around the neck, and should not be removed unless absolutely necessary. The Roman Catholic Church offers extensive network of pastoral, social, and medical support services. health (mental health) No objection to mental health practices and treatment.

Some observances may be open only to members. Priests and priestesses, if present in a group, may perform special rituals. Group practice occurs on the lunar observance days and on the eight seasonal festivals celebrated by many Pagans.

Ritual jewelry is however very common and may have deep personal religious significance. In some traditions, the wearing of a ring, which symbolizes the person's adherence to Paganism or a particular Pagan path, is common. The removal of such a ring may cause considerable distress. Ritual clothing at festivals is common. death: dying Practices Many (though not all) Pagans believe in some form of reincarnation. The emphasis in funerals is, therefore, often on joyfulness for the departed in passing on to a new life, but also consolation for relatives and friends that the person will be reborn. Those who do not believe in reincarnation may celebrate the return to the natural and spirit worlds of the components that made up the life of the deceased. Disposal of the body may be by burning (cremation) or burial. Funeral services will take place in the crematorium chapel, at the graveside, or at the deceased's home. In some traditions, any religious items of significance to the deceased are buried or burned with the body. These might include ritual jewelry, personal ritual items such as the Witch's anthem, and the person's religious writings (such as the Book of Shadows). eArth-BAsed sPiritUAlitY68 Religious liteRacy PRimeR \u00a9 NDIN 2014 v .1death: Body Preparation Wakes (mourning ceremonies) carried out around the body by friends and relatives are common in some traditions.

The Vaishnava (Vaishnavite) many distinct denominations, among them ISKCON and BAPS. Basic t enets Hinduism encompasses a wide range of beliefs about the nature of God and the divine human relationship. All agree that Ultimate Reality (Brahman) is without form. Rather than the term Brahman, some prefer to speak of the Ultimate as Bhagavan\u2014that which includes the limitless six elements: wealth, knowledge, overlordship, valor, dispassionateness, and fame. Hinduism's branches and denominations differ according to the form through which they worship Ultimate Reality/God, the details of their descriptions of the complexity of the celestial realm, and their particular traditions of practice. Among American Hindus, it is common to assert that all of Hinduism's 330 million deities are manifestations of the one Brahman. However, some American Hindus reject this notion. Om or AUM Swastika 70 Religious liteRacy PRimeR \u00a9 NDIN 2014 v .1Basic t enets The four theological systems share many of Hinduism's most popular deities, but differ over their relation to the Ultimate. For example, the elephant-headed Ganesha may be a form of the Ultimate in one system, and merely a helper of God in another. For Shaivites, Vishnu names a function of Shiva-as-Ultimate; for Vaishnavites, Vishnu personifies the Ultimate. A few key concepts are embraced by the majority of Hindus, regardless of theological or philosophical branch. These include: Samsara: the cycle of birth, life, and rebirth. Karma: the law of cause and effect, which drives samsara. Reincarnation: the notion that the self takes birth multiple times (and, that there are multiple possible realms into which the self might be born). Moksha: liberation; release from samsara. Multiple valid methods (yogas, margas) to God including: Jnana Yoga - the way to God through knowledge (uses the Upanishads as its source; often associated with advaita philosophy). Bhakti Yoga - the Way to God through love (the most popular path; emphasizes devotional practices using deity-images in the belief that it is difficult for many people to pray to \"the Impersonal Absolute). Karma Yoga - the Way to God through work (emphasis on service). sacred t exts The Vedas are the oldest sacred texts of Hinduism. Of these four collections, the Rig Veda is the best known. Two epics\u2014the Mahabharata and the Ramayana\u2014are treasured by many Hindus. The Bhagavad Gita (Comprising several sections of book six of the Mahabharata)\u2014a dialogue between the human Arjuna and God (incarnate as Lord Krishna) on the nature of reality and duty\u2014is core to the devotional practices of a great many U.S. Hindus. The Srimad Bhagavatam is a central text for members of the International Society of Krishna Consciousness. The Upanishads are a Collection of some 100 works of dialogue, poetry, and prose that emphasize salvation by insight and knowledge rather than mere reliance on ritual action. sacred Buildings/ structuresA Hindu place of worship or practice is called amandir (Sanskrit for house of the divine). In the U.S., Hindu houses of worship are often called temples. Occasionally; a synonym from one of India's many languages may be used. Mandirs will house one or many murtis (deity-statues, deity-images). Some may use two-dimensional representations of the divine. A Hindu place of study with a spiritual guide is called an ashram. The U.S. is home to a number of ashrams. governance (Judicatory) Some U.S. Hindu temples are members of international movements. Examples include temples affiliated with BAPS [Bochasanwasi Shri Akshar of Krishna Consciousness]. In these cases, a national or international headquarters provides governance and sets policies. hindUism\u00a9 NDIN 2014 v .1 v.1 \u00a9 NDIN 2014 Religious liteRacy PRimeR 71governance (congregation)Many U.S. Hindu temples are independent entities.

Guru: a teacher around whom disciples gather. Pandit (sometimes, Pundit): a scholar and teacher of Hindu literature, law, ritual. Acharya: a spiritual guide or instructor in religious matters, in some traditions believed to be an avatar of the divine. Swami: an ascetic who has renounced his/her birth-name upon initiation into a monastic order. A Hindu temple founder or president of its board of directors may also be considered a religious leader. religious objects/symbols Objects for rituals - including: Statues, symbols or pictures representing a particular deity.

Facilitating Practices Hospital visitation by Hindu clergy is not common; some Hindu patients will be open to visits by a chaplain from some other religion. Family members will appreciate being involved in the plan of care and determine which member will provide personal care. Be aware that, in some American Hindu families, the father/husband retains the traditional role of primary spokesperson to whom questions should be directed. culture & social interactionHindus who have come to the U.S. recently, or who are elderly, may have high standards of modesty. Observant Hindus may accept an invitation to a meal, yet maintain a fast. hindUism72 Religious liteRacy PRimeR \u00a9 NDIN 2014 v .1gender roles/interaction Hinduism in the U.S. context is often egalitarian. Many U.S. temples have been founded by women, or have a woman as chief officer. However, some movements are quite restrictive of women (beyond the tradition of male-only pujaris [priests].) In modern times the view of the husband as the soul of the married couple is less pronounced than in the past. Arranged marriages are still practiced, but the bride-to-be has considerable voice in the matter. Principal Weekly observance(s)Weekly congregational worship is not a Hindu tradition. However, in the U.S. context, many temples offer weekend opportunities for study or meditation. Some movements do hold weekly congregational worship opportunities. Members of the BAPS movement are expected to meet weekly at the mandir for sabha\u2014a spiritual discourse and congregational prayer and song. Member of ISKCON meet once or twice weekly for fellowship, chanting, a discourse by one of the monks, prayers, and a vegetarian meal. The Bhakti tradition special ceremonies in honor of specific deities according to a lunar calendar. Thus, in a given month, there will be many times when the community will be present in the temple in large numbers for worship. daily religious Practices Daily practice is determined by many factors\u2014most especially which yoga one follows. Hindus who practice Bhakti Yoga perform daily puja (worship involving care for a deity-image as it were a royal guest) or arthi (a prayer ritual before an image, involving chanting while offering light from an oil lamp). Hindus who practice Raja Yoga perform daily meditation, which may include taking specific postures and performing specific breathing exercises. Some Hindus chant a specific mantra daily. Some Hindus engage in daily study of sacred texts; the Bhagavad-gita is a favorite for many. holy days/Festivals Hindu holidays vary, depending on the theological branch in which one participates, whether one's family is from North India or South India, and whether one belongs to one of the more recent Hindu reform movements. Krishna's Birthday (late August): important to Hindus in the Vaishnavite tradition, especially those whose devotion focuses on Krishna. Navaratri (Nine Nights); also called Dussehra; a great Goddess festival in October; important to many Hindus; especially important to members of the Shakta theological stream. The focus of this festival varies regionally: for Hindus from North India, the focus is on Durga; in the South India tradition, three days are devoted to Lakshmi (Goddess of Wealth); three for Parvati (Daughter of the Mountains, another name for Durga), and three for Saraswati (the Goddess of Learning and the Arts, of Speech, and of the creative process). Vijayadasami: the day following Navaratri, this is a day of rededication to one's profession, or of a child to his/her studies. For Hindus from North India, this is tied to remembrance of the story of Rama (enshrined in the epic Ramayana). Holi: Celebration at the start of spring, with much use of colors. Diwali: The festival of lights (in the fall), with its further meaning varying according to the part of India from which one's family hails. Ganesha festival (late August or early September): a celebration of the elephant- headed deity, the Remover of Obstacles. hindUism\u00a9 NDIN 2014 v .1 v.1 \u00a9 NDIN 2014 Religious liteRacy PRimeR 73rituals/ceremonies Many Hindus perform a daily act of personal devotion at home, either alone or with others. Ritual washing normally precedes the daily morning prayer ritual (puja). Hindus recognize 16 life-transitions to be marked with samskaras (rituals). Among these are the samskaras for blessing an unborn child, and the ceremonial occasion for naming a newborn. Timing and ritual details vary. Some families prefer to have these samskaras performed at home; others prefer to go to a temple for the ritual. dress (religious restrictions)Hinduism does not prescribe specific clothing for laypersons, and many often wear Western-style clothing. However, some Hindu women in the U.S. prefer to wear a sari (a one-piece garment wound around the body), particularly when visiting a temple of participating in a festival or special occasion. Some Hindu women or men may wear shalwarkameez or pyjamakurta (loose pants and tunic). Pujaris (ritual performers) customarily wear white traditional garments when on duty in the temple. Those who have taken monastic vows (for example, in the ISKCON tradition) wear distinguishing traditional garments. death: dying Practices For the Hindu, death marks a passage, rather than an ending. While the body dies, the soul may take birth in another form. Family or friends may try to make the atmosphere around the dying person peaceful, and focused on the divine; by reading from scriptures such as the Bhagavad-gita, or playing recordings of devotional music such as a hymn to Ganesha (the Remover of Obstacles). death: Body Preparation Autopsy and organ donation are acceptable to many Hindus. Hindus prefer cremation\u2014traditionally within 24 hours of death. Traditional preparation includes washing of the body, and wrapping it in a white seamless cloth. Some U.S. cities have crematoria in which Hindu rites and customs are accommodated. It is customary for a family member to attend the body until cremated. The deceased person's family may fast until the cremation takes place.

Some will eat only food they or their community members have prepared accompanied by prayer. Some refrain from alcohol; or, from garlic and onion; or, from cheese. Hindus may eat with the right hand only (the left hand being reserved for toileting and hygiene). Fasting is commonplace and frequent, generally lasting just one day or one day a week, in connection with devotion to a particular deity or observance of a particular festival. Fasts may involve abstinence from certain foods only, or total abstinence from food and drink during daylight. health (medical care) On the whole, Hindu patients will be accepting of all conventional and state-of-the-art medical treatment options. Medication, blood and blood products, donation and receipt of organs acceptable. Because many Hindus eat with their right hand and reserve the left hand for toileting and washing, they may prefer the right hand for placement of an IV. Some Hindus may prefer Ayurvedic treatment options. Some Hindus may consult an astrological chart to determine an auspicious date for surgery. Some Hindus, especially the elderly, may prefer that females be examined by females and males by males, whenever possible. Some Hindus may be very uncomfortable with American-style hospital gowns and may prefer clothing from home; medical personnel might explore this option with the family. Because of their belief in samsara and reincarnation, many Hindus are comfortable in deciding not to use life-extending technology when there is little likelihood of full recovery. A Hindu patient may wish to display a picture of a deity on his/her hospital bed-stand or to meditate. Notions of karma and rebirth may influence a Hindu's attitude in the face of illness: illness may be seen as the consequence of behaviors in past lives; it can also be seen as an opportunity to prepare for a better rebirth. health (mental health) On the whole, Hindus will be accepting of all conventional and state-of-the-art mental healthcare options. As with physical illness Notions of karma and rebirth may influence a Hindu's attitude in the face of mental health challenges. Pregnancy and Birth Birth control, artificial insemination and amniocentesis acceptable will be acceptable to many Hindus. Hinduism provides rites of blessing for pregnancy as well as for birth. hindUism\u00a9 NDIN 2014 v .1 v.1 \u00a9 NDIN 2014 Religious liteRacy PRimeR 75For service Providers Physical contact Some Hindus, especially the elderly, may prefer that females be examined by females and males by males, whenever possible. dietary restrictions Many Hindus are vegetarian; some are vegan.

The American Ethical Union (a network of Ethical Culture Society congregations) is an example of a well-organized humanist denomination with many local chapters. Basic t enets Humanism is not a creedal or doctrinal religion, nor do Humanists agree upon a particular text as \"scripture\" or source of ultimate truth. A few commonalities can be found among Humanists. Humanists believe that moral values are founded on human nature and experience; ethical principles, on reason and mutual respect. They encourage collaboration for the common good. While some Humanists are theists, many reject notions of God or supernatural agency. In general, Humanists do not believe in an afterlife. sacred t exts N/A sacred Buildings/ structuresNo particular requirements.

Branches & denominations Sunni Islam is the largest branch accounting for nearly 80% of all Muslims. Shi'a Islam, the second-largest branch, includes some 15% of all Muslims; Shi'ism itself has several denominations\u2014Twelver and Isma'ili being the largest. Sufism (sometimes called Islamic mysticism or mystical Islam) straddles the major branches of Islam. Many Muslims who identify as Sufis will also claim to be Sunni or Shi'a. However, the U.S. has been home to several small movements whose adherents claim to be \"Sufi\" but not \"Muslim.\"Ahmadiyyah is an Islamic messianistic movement founded by Mirza Ghulam Ahmad in India in the late 19th century. It attracted many African-Americans in the early decades of the 20 th century. Presently, its U.S. adherents include many South Asians. The U.S. religious landscape has spawned a number of Islam-based religious movements. Two of the most prominent are: Nation of Islam: founded in Detroit, MI, in the 1930s by Elijah Muhammad (Elijah Poole) and his forerunner, Wallace D. Fard. Moorish Science Temple of America: founded in Newark, NJ, by Noble Drew Ali (Timothy Drew) in 1913. Basic t enets Islam means \"submission\" to the will of Allah (God). As a religion, it has three essential aspects: submission (normative practices), faith (normative doctrines), and the doing of the beautiful (rooted in God-consciousness). Core practices (called the Five Pillars of Islam by Sunni Muslims) are Shahadah - testimony to God's Oneness and Muhammad's Prophethood, Salat\u2014five- times-daily ritual during the month of Ramadan/ Ramazan, Zakat\u2014charity, and Hajj (pilgrimage to the Ka'aba in Mecca, if health and means permit). Shi'a Muslims call core practices the ten Ancillaries of the Faith, or (Branches) of Religion. Shi'a Islam include all practices on the Sunni list (with the exception that some Shi'a sects pray three times a day instead of five) but additionally: Khums - tax of 1/5; Jihad - struggle to please Allah; Amr-bil-ma'ruf - is a Qur'anic commandment to enjoin what is good; Nahi-anil-munkar - is a Qur'anic commandment to \"forbid what is evil;\" Tawalla - expressing love towards good; and Tabarra - expressing disassociation from Evil. Star and Crescent 80 Religious liteRacy PRimeR \u00a9 NDIN 2014 v .1Basic t enets Core doctrines (called the Six Pillars of Iman or belief/faith by Sunni Muslims) are belief in God, the angels, the revealed Scriptures (the Qur'an, but also the scriptures of Judaism and Christianity, a long line of Prophets (culminating in the Prophet Muhammad), the Day of Judgment (thus belief in life after death), and Divine Decrees regarding the Qadar, or ultimate destiny of each individual. Shi'a Muslims call core doctrines the five Principles of the Religion, or Roots of Religion; their list calls for belief in God's Oneness; Divine justice; Prophethood; the notion that (after the death of Muhammad) authentic guidance of the Muslim fell to a series of infallible; divinely inspired Imams; and belief in resurrection. sacred t exts The Qur'an is considered \"God's speech\"\u2014the very words of God transmitted to Muhammad by the Angel Gabriel. Some Muslims believe that the Qur'an should not be touched by non-Muslims, except with a cloth. Any copy or translation should be handled with respect by all. Observant Muslim women do not touch the Qur'an if they are menstruating. The Hadith\u2014the multi-volume collection of reports of what the Prophet Muhammad said and did\u2014is second in authority after the Qur'an in determining matters of doctrine and practice. sacred Buildings/ structuresA place for Muslims to gather for Salat (ritual prayer) is called a masjid (place of prostration) or mosque. In the U.S., many cities have at least one Islamic Center - which includes a mosque, but also features facilities for education, religious counseling, and dispute settlement. Dergah = a place where Sufis gather for fellowship, instruction, and prayer. governance (Judicatory) There are no senior muslim clerics in the U.S. with authority over all other imams in the United States. Many communities have an Imams Council, sometimes called a Shura Council, which addresses areas of concerns to local Muslims, engages in advocacy, provides social services, and issues opinions on matters of Islamic Law. governance (congregation) Many U.S. Islamic centers and mosques are independent, and are overseen by a board of directors. For many U.S. Muslim congregations, the president of its board of directors is the chief decision-maker, and may also be its most public representative; for others, this role is assumed by (or is shared with) the imam. Point of contact Local: Islamic Center / Mosque (called Masjid in Arabic) Regional: Sometimes a \"Shura Council\" (a voluntary association) National: These groups are examples of organized national bodies without formal authority.

(Traditionally, a congregation's Imam is a man; a woman may serve as prayer-leader for a women-only gathering.) Shaykh/Shaykha: spiritual leader (usually male, occasionally female), especially of a Sufi Circle. Muslim Chaplain: a Muslim man or woman with special training, able to give spiritual care in a hospital, prison, university, or the military. religious objects/symbols The Qur'an itself. The word \"Allah\" (God) written in Arabic calligraphy. Medallions containing the name of Muhammad, or of each of the Four Rightly Guided Caliphs (in Sunni understanding, the first four leaders of the Islamic community after the death of the Prophet Muhammad), or of each of the Twelve Infallible Imams (in majority Shi'ia understanding, the series of authoritative leaders of the Islamic community in the period following the death of the Prophet). Minaret: traditional tower next to a mosque, from which the Call to Prayer is sounded. Facilitating Practices Discuss expected observances occurring during shelter/hospital/care center stay with individual/patient/family. Muslims will appreciate provision being made for their daily prayer rituals (Salat), with an adequate facility for performing the mandatory pre-prayer washing (Wudu). Salat can be performed in any clean space. In the absence of prayer rugs, freshly laundered towels or sheets can be substituted. Help may be needed in determining the direction of prayer (Qibla), which is oriented toward the Ka'abah in Mecca; cellphone apps are available for this. culture & social interactionSome observant Muslims refrain from all physical contact with persons of the opposite gender who are not members of their family. gender roles/interaction Mixed-gendered prayer is generally led by men; women will lead other women in prayer. Women leading mixed-gendered prayer is more rare.Scholars of Islam can be men and women. Congregational leadership positions are often held by men; though in some sects women play hold equal position. Notions of gender norms vis-\u00e0-vis congregational leadership vary greatly. Some Muslims believe that men and woman who are not immediate members of the same family should not interact socially or make physical contact with one another. (The views on this point are quite wide-ranging among U.S. Muslims.) The Qur'an expresses two main views on the role of women. The Qur'an states that men and women are created from a single soul; it indicates that, before God, women and men are equal in terms of expectations of piety and can expect equal divine reward. Women and men are created for mutual benefit. Because of physical differences and societal needs, the Qur'an calls for equanimity rather than equality of duties and privileges between women and men; the terms of inheritance are less than for men; men have permission to marry outside the religion, but it is commonly viewed that women should not. islAm82 Religious liteRacy PRimeR \u00a9 NDIN 2014 v .1Principal Weekly observance(s)Muslim men are expected (if at all possible) to pray in congregation on Fridays in the early afternoon; this is called Ju'mah. Women may attend Ju'mah prayer at the mosque if they wish; they are permitted to pray at home if they prefer. Shi 'ah Muslims often gather on Thursday evenings to pray a long supplication of Imam Ali and to perform the evening salat. Many Sufi circles meet weekly (some on Thursday evening, some on Saturday evening or some other evening) for fellowship, spiritual guidance (in the form of a discourse by their shaykh), supplication, dhikr (sometimes pronounced zikr\u2014remembrance of God's Names), and salat. daily religious Practices Salat (ritual prayer) five times daily facing the Ka'abah in Mecca: before dawn, soon after midday, late afternoon, after sunset, and late evening; exact timings determined by sunrise and sunset. Ritual washing (Wudu) is to be performed before praying. Salat is performed shoulder-to-shoulder in rows behind the imam in many mosques; men line up immediately behind the Imam and women form lines behind the men; in some mosques, men are on one side, women on the other (with some sort of barrier down the center; in some, women are in a different part of the building from the men. Salat involves the recitation (silently or aloud) of specific texts and the performance of a series of postures; opportunity is included for individual supplication. holy days/Festivals Muslims follow a 12-month lunar calendar. Major observances include: The First of Muharram: commemorates the date on which the Prophet and his community made the Hijra (migration) from Mecca to Medina\u2014thus beginning a new Islamic society; begins the new Islamic Year (celebrated by some branches of the Muslim community; merely noted by others). The Ten Days of Muharram: days of lamentation observed by Shi'a Muslims in remembrance of the martyrdom of Imam Hussein bin Ali, the grandson of the Prophet, at Karbala (Iraq) in 61 A. H. ' Ashura (the Tenth of Muharram) is observed by Shi 'a as the anniversary of Husayn's death. Some Sunni Muslims observe it as the anniversary of the day on which God created Adam and Eve, heaven and hell, the tablet of the decree, the pen, life, and death. Milad al-Nabi (the Prophet's Birthday: because it lacks basis in the Qur'an some Sunni Muslims believe there should be no special celebration of this occasion). Ramadan/Ramazan: a month of total fasting from food and liquids (and from intercourse and smoking) during daylight hours. Laylat al-Qadir (Night of Power): all-night prayer during Ramadan. Eid al-Fitr (Festival of Fast-Breaking): three-day celebration at the end of the month of Ramadan, including special prayer as a community in the mosque, visits with family and friends, special foods, giving of gifts to the children, and making a special charitable donation. Eid al-Adha (Festival of Sacrifice): a four-day commemoration of Abraham's willingness to sacrifice his son that begins on the tenth day of the month of the annual Hajj (pilgrimage), and includes donation of food to the poor. islAm\u00a9 NDIN 2014 v .1 v.1 \u00a9 NDIN 2014 Religious liteRacy PRimeR 83rituals/ceremonies Shahadah (testimony): a ceremony in which a person repeats the Islamic declaration of faith: \"there is no deity but God, and Muhammad is the messenger of God\" in the presence of witnesses, thus becoming a Muslim. Wedding: Islamic marriage is regarded as a legal (albeit sacred) contract; couple's contract is worked out in detail with the help of family members and advisors, the contract is ratified by recitation of the Fatiha (the first chapter of the Qur'an). In addition, the couple may declare their agreement to an imam (in front of family and friends), who then offers a discourse on the joys, obligations, and challenges of marriage. 'Aqiqah (also called other names based on the country of origin of the family): An informal ceremony by which a new infant is welcomed into the Muslim community; sometimes the infant's head is shaved (or, a tuft of hair is clipped); traditionally, sheep or goats are slaughtered, and the meat is shared with family, friends, and the poor. dress (religious restrictions) Many Muslim women wear hijab (headscarf); a loose garment leaving only the hands showing may be worn in public or in the presence of men who are not family members; a few Muslim women wear a niqab (face-veil). At the least, observant men are to cover their bodies from navel to knees when in public; some devout male Muslims prefer to wear a head-covering at all times. death: dying Practices When death is imminent, family and friends will gather to recite from the Qur'an (or will play recordings of Qur'an chapters). Particularly appropriate are Surah Ya Sin (Chapter 36) and Surat'l-Mulk (Chapter 67). The dying person will try to say the Shahadah prayer (the testimony of faith); or, will appreciate family or friends reciting it. The dying person's face or bed should be turned towards Mecca. death: culture/Practices The family or a Muslim chaplain should be consulted before giving postmortem care. When giving post-mortem care, the deceased's head should be turned to the right, the arms laid to the sides of the body. The hair of the deceased should not be cut. A Muslim family will expect to bury the deceased quickly. death: Body Preparation Autopsy is acceptable when necessary. Organ donation is acceptable. Many Muslims prefer that a Muslim of the same sex as the deceased prepare the body. Some U.S. cities now have Islamic funeral homes; many Muslim congregations include people well trained to perform the ritual washing of bodies for burial. Detached body parts to be treated with respect. The body is then wrapped in plain cloth (three pieces for a man and five for a woman), then placed on the right shoulder in a plain coffin. A Muslim funeral is usually held at a mosque. The ritually prepared body is present in a coffin; a eulogy is given; the Janazah (the special prayer for the deceased) is performed. Next of kin or local Muslim community will make arrangements for burial (never cremation), preferably within 24 hours. Muslims prefer to bury the body directly in the ground, facing Mecca; some U.S. cities now have cemeteries where this is allowed. In the grave, the face of the deceased should be positioned towards Mecca. islAm84 Religious liteRacy PRimeR \u00a9 NDIN 2014 v .1dietary laws and customs Many Muslims believe in only eating halal food, especially halal meat. All fruits and vegetables are acceptable; vegetarian meals are generally acceptable. Poultry, mutton, and beef are halal if the animal has been slaughtered in accordance with Islamic law; Some Muslims may accept Kosher meat as having fulfilled this requirement. Muslims are not to eat pork in any form; foods and utensils that have come into contact with pork should not touch any food to be eaten by a Muslim. Fish is acceptable, but some Muslims refrain from eating shellfish. Consumption of alcohol in any form is forbidden. (Some Muslims say that this includes alcohol used in cooking; others say that cooking dissipates the alcohol, so the food may still be eaten. In general it is best to omit alcohol including items like vanilla in cooking.) Halal food should be clearly labeled where other food is served. Many Muslims believe that food should be eaten only with the right hand. Muslims fast from dawn to sunset during the month of Ramadan/Ramazan; some fast in a similar fashion at other times during the year. Fasting during Ramadan/Ramazan is compulsory for all except menstruating, pregnant or lactating women; young children; and the infirm. health (medical care) Muslims often believe that God has predetermined what will happen in one's life, including the place and time of death, thus may complain very little, and will cope with illness by trusting in God. No restrictions on blood or blood products, medications, amputations, or biopsies. Organ donation and reception is permitted, although this has raised questions related to Judgment Day for some Muslims. Many surgical implants are permitted; however, some Muslims believe it is forbidden to have anything containing a pig or shellfish product implanted in their bodies. Many Muslims will be comfortable accepting conventional surgical procedures. Some Muslims are uncomfortable with (and may even refuse) a healthcare provider who is not of the same gender. Muslim women patients should be accommodated if they desire a hospital gown that will cover their entire body, and if they desire to keep their hair covered. health (mental health) The Journal of Muslim Mental Health may provide helpful resources to Muslims seeking mental health services. Generally, Muslims are open to conventional mental health care options, but this may be limited by cultural factors outside of faith. Pregnancy and Birth Birth control is acceptable. Generally Muslims view abortion as not acceptable, except in instances of great risk to the mother's life. Muslim women may prefer to receive care from female healthcare staff only. Artificial insemination permitted between husband and wife. Because Muslims believe that the soul is \"breathed into\" the fetus at four months' gestation, a miscarried fetus before that point may be discarded as would any other tissue; a fetus miscarried after that point is to be washed and shrouded, is to have the Janazah (funeral prayer) recited on its behalf, and buried as would any human being. islAm\u00a9 NDIN 2014 v .1 v.1 \u00a9 NDIN 2014 Religious liteRacy PRimeR 85For service Providers Physical contact Treatment by medical staff of any religion permissible; men and women generally prefer to be treated by staff of the same gender whenever possible.

Chitrabhanu was the first Jain monk to travel to the United States; he arrived in 1971, gave several lectures about Jainism at Harvard University, and established a Jain center in New York. In 1975 a second Jain monk, Acharya Sushil Kumar Ji, arrived in the United States, and established multiple Jain centers. Branches & denominations Three main branches: Swetambara: those whose monks and nuns wear white robes, and whose murtis (devotional statues) are embellished, with eyes looking straight ahead. Digambara: those whose monks wear no clothing at all, and whose murtis (devotional statues) are plain, with eyes downcast. Sthanakvasi: those who reject the use of murtis (devotional images). Swetambara and Digambara both have several denominations with adherents in the U.S. Basic t enets Jains believe that the universe is beginningless and endless, with no divine manager or creator God Each living being is an eternally individual soul caught in samsara (perpetual birth-death-rebirth). Freedom from samsara is achieved by cultivating right knowledge, right faith, and right conduct\u2014practice of three core Jain values: non-harming; non- attachment; and recognition of multiplicity of viewpoints. All sentient beings have the potential to become purified souls; taking birth as a human being enhances this potential. At points in human history, a series of 24 Tirthankaras (crossing-makers) have appeared to encourage the establishment of the Jain way of life; Mahavira was the 24 th and last of these guides. Jain prayer is not supplication; rather, it comprises recollection of the example of the tirthankas and hoping to be like them, by striving toward an ascetic lifestyle. sacred t exts Jain scriptures are called the Agam Sutras (or Agamas) and are based on the sermons of Mahavira. The Digambara collection differs somewhat from the Swetambara version, but the general content is the same. Jain Prateek Chihna 88 Religious liteRacy PRimeR \u00a9 NDIN 2014 v .1sacred Buildings/ structures A Jain house of worship is called a mandir or a derasar. A Jain Center (or temple) may be found in many U.S. metropolitan areas. Generally, U.S. Jain Centers include a multipurpose meeting space, a commercial kitchen, administrative offices, classrooms, and a residence for the pujari (ritual expert) and his family, as well as the worship hall. governance (Judicatory) JAINA (Federation of Jain Associations in North America) was founded in the 1980s as a network of Jain temples in the U.S. and Canada; JAINA enhances solidarity, provides advocacy, and holds conventions. governance (congregation) Jain Centers are independent and self-governing, usually with a board of directors. Point of contact Local: Jain Center Regional: N/A National: JAINA (Federation of Jain Associations in North America) religious leaders Jain Temples often have a pujari on staff who maintains the images and conducts puja (ritual of hospitality for the images) and arthi (ritual of light). A Jain Temple may have a resident Guru. The president of the board of directors and other Jain Center officers are considered religious leaders, and provide interface with the wider community. religious objects/symbols Symbols: A symbol in common use comprises an open, raised hand denoting friendly reassurance and ethical responsibility; on the palm is written ahimsa (non-violence); below it is written (in Sanskrit) \"All life is bound together by mutual support and interdependence.\" Lokapurusha: a diagram of the cosmos in the shape of a human being, which serves as an aid for teaching Jain doctrine. Ritual objects: Murtis (statues/images) of the tirthankaras are used in Jain devotional practice. Statues of other beings from the celestial realm may also be found in Jain temples. A bell suspended from the ceiling is used during worship; oil lamps are used to perform arthi. Facilitating Practices Jains practice their own methods of meditation, and will appreciate a quiet place for this. culture & social interaction While beliefs vary between the branches of Jainism, all branches follow a vegetarian diet (many choosing a vegan diet). Some strict Jains may choose not to eat after sunset so care should be taken when planning meetings or events where food is served. gender roles/interaction Jainism is essentially egalitarian. Women are often prominent in U.S. temple administrative leadership. Women may take monastic vows in the Swetambara sect. Menstruating women are asked not to enter the ritual area of a Jain temple's murti-hall. JAinism\u00a9 NDIN 2014 Religious liteRacy PRimeR 89Principal Weekly observance(s)Weekly congregational gathering is not part of the Jain tradition. However, in the U.S., Jains often gather on weekends for meditation, instruction, and performance of devotional rituals (puja, arthi, hymn-singing) plus a sermon by a Guru giving guidance in following Jain principles. Many congregational gatherings are determined by the rhythms of the lunar calendar. daily religious Practices The NavkarMaha-Mantra (Great Salutation Formula) is the most important, most basic Jain formula, and can be recited at any time of day. Meditation is a daily practice for many Jains. holy days/Festivals Jain holidays follow a lunar calendar. The most significant are: ParyushanParva: eight or ten days during August or September. Having reflected on the year past, prayers are recited; sins are confessed; forgiveness is sought from all sentient beings; penances are undertaken. SamvatsariPratikramana (or Samayika)\u2014a detailed, three-hour ceremony of spiritual review and renewal of faith at the end of ParyushanParva. rituals/ceremonies Rituals at the temple (mandir; derasar) Dravya Puja: making symbolic physical offerings to images of the Tirthankaras. Bhav Puja: concentration on the Tirthankaras with deep feeling. Meditation: use of any of several methods. Samayika (equanimity): the practice of remaining calm and undisturbed for a period of 48 minutes or more. dress (religious restrictions) Swetambara Jain monks and nuns wear white traditional clothing. White traditional Indian garments and a mask over the mouth are worn when performing certain rituals. Otherwise, there is no religiously mandated clothing for Jains. Jain laymen in the U.S. tend to wear western-style clothing. Jain laywomen may wear western-style clothing, but many prefer to wear traditional Indian dress, such as the sari. death: dying Practices If death is certain and there is nothing to benefit by staying in the hospital, Jains may prefer to spend his/her last moments at home. He/she will wish for mental detachment of all desires and concentrate on the inner self. Family members or others will assist by reciting text or chanting verses from the canon. As much peace and quiet should be maintained as possible. When a person is aware of approaching death, and feels that all his or her duties have been fulfilled, he or she may decide to gradually cease eating and drinking. This form of dying is also called santhara. death: culture/Practices A mantra is recited and hymns are sung at the deathbed. The body is cremated within twenty-four hours of death if possible. Before cremation, the Jain funeral rites consist of a period of meditation for the peace of the soul, and a sermon and advice to those present. After cremation, the ashes are traditionally scattered in the Ganges or another sacred river. Some Jain families follow Hindu customs for the deceased. JAinism90 Religious liteRacy PRimeR \u00a9 NDIN 2014 v .1death: Body Preparation In the Indian subcontinent, the dead person is normally cremated within twenty-four hours of death (though there may be a delay of up to a week among the diaspora in Europe and the United States). dietary laws and customs Jains are vegan. No root vegetables (such as onions, garlic, potatoes, carrots, beets). No alcohol. No dairy products. Generally acceptable: salads, fruits, cooked grain of all types, cooked vegetables, bread or biscuits made without the use of eggs and dairy products. diet (religious restrictions)Observant Jains undertake fasts on various days throughout year: Every lunar month has at least five days during which strict Jains might fast. Some fasts involve abstaining from green things on certain designated calendar days, or eating only once a day, or eating twice a day, or not eating at all. A Jain day of fasting is a thirty-six hour period\u2014from the evening of the day before until the morning of the day after. Annually, in late August or early September, Jains keep a week-long fast, which may mean eating just once a day, or eating twice a day. Some Jains perform eight days of strict fasting where they drink only boiled water, and only during sunlight hours. Some Jains perform month-long fasts, selecting certain days to have a single meal, and keeping a total fast on the other days. health (medical care) Jains are willing to accept conventional Western-style medical procedures, but will weigh options carefully. Jain principles of ahimsa (non-harming) and aparigraha (non-attachment) play major roles in helping Jains make decisions regarding medical care, particularly in determining the extent to use life-extending technology, or whether to make or receive an organ donation. health (mental health) Generally, Jains are open to conventional mental healthcare options; many Jains promote meditation and fasting as means to reduce tension. Pregnancy and Birth Abortion is forbidden; birth control an individual choice. No religiously mandated rituals around childbirth. For service Providers Physical contact Same-gender contact and separate male and female wards preferred; no taboo where medical and/or specialist personnel are involved. dietary restrictions Vegan diet should be observed. medical t reatment Blood transfusions and organ transplants are acceptable, if not obtained at the expense of another life. Medication for the purpose of saving life usually accepted without question. mental health care On the whole, Jains will be accepting of all conventional and state-of-the-art mental healthcare options. mass care Facilities If toilet and bathroom are separate, a water supply and beaker should be provided in the toilet for cleaning purposes.JAinism\u00a9 NDIN 2014 v .1 v.1 \u00a9 NDIN 2014 Religious liteRacy PRimeR 91JUDAISM Adherents consider themselves JeWish. Adherents Are c Alled JeWs. the religion is c Alled JUd Aism. U.s. Population 5,242,000 language (Worship) Hebrew and English Founder(s) The patriarch Abraham is in one sense the founder of Judaism. In another sense, the founder is Moses, to whom God gave the entirety of Jewish Law (as the Orthodox may note). In yet another sense, the Rabbis who codified the Jewish scriptures c. 100 ce, and compiled the Talmud, can be said to have founded Judaism as it is practiced today. Each of the major denominations of Judaism has its own founding figure. Branches & denominations In U.S., four main denominations: Orthodox, Conservative, Reform, Reconstruc-tionist; some may add a fifth: Humanistic. The U.S. Jewish community also has many ethnic/cultural sub-divisions; Ashkenazim (roots in Russia and Eastern Europe) Sephardim (heirs of Jews expelled from the Iberian Peninsula in 1492), and Mizrachi (Middle Eastern and North African). Smaller groups include, but are not restricted to, Indian Jews such as the Bene Israel, Bnei Menashe, Cochin Jews, Italian Jews; the Teimanim from Yemen and Oman; various African Jews, including the Beta Israel of Ethiopia; and Chinese Jews. Basic t enets Beliefs and practices vary considerably from one denomination to the next. The Shema (taken from the Book of Deuteronomy) begins: Sh'maYisrael Adonai Eloheinu Adonai Echad (Hear, Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is One), and is the central affirmation of Judaism. Most Jews believe in God, who is one, indivisible; by whose will the universe and all that is in it was created. Most Jews see Judaism as a means of recognizing and realizing a covenant relationship of God and Humanity . Judaism is therefore about kedushah (sacredness) mitzvah (obligation); and emunah (faith). They differ among themselves in the degree of literalness with which they approach halacha (Jewish Law). The notion of kedushah (sacredness) encourages Jews to \"make sanctuaries in time\" by observing Shabbat and following a unique calendar in parallel to that of larger society, and to engage in \"holy eating\" by following the dietary requirements of Jewish Law. For many Jews, the notion of mitzvah means that the commitments, obligations, duties, and commandments of Torah (divine instruction) have priority over rights and individual pleasures. Judaism teaches that the sanctity of life is paramount; saving life overrides nearly all obligations. Jews have a strong sense of peoplehood; this is often expressed in terms of \"chosenness\" (although the Reconstructionist Movement rejects this notion). For Jews, congregational prayer and community is the cornerstone of faith; the study of Torah is equivalent to prayer.Star of David 92 Religious liteRacy PRimeR \u00a9 NDIN 2014 v .1sacred t exts Torah: both the written Torah (which may be defined as the Five Books of Moses; or, as the totality of Jewish written scripture) and the Oral Torah (now in written form as the Talmud); Traditionally, the Torah (i.e. the Five Books of Moses) is in scroll form, particularly when used in worship. Jewish sacred texts are organized in book form as the Tanakh\u2014an acronym for its three sections: Torah, Nevi'im (Prophets), and Ketuvim (Writings). The Talmud is a multi-volume companion to the Torah (the Five Books of Moses), organized by topic. The Siddur (prayer book; guide to Shabbat worship) can also be considered a Jewish sacred text. sacred Buildings/ structuresA Jewish house of worship is called a synagogue (from the Greek for \"house of assembly\"). It may be called a Beth Knesset (Hebrew for \"house of assembly\"), a Beth Midrash (house of study), or Shul (Yiddish for \"house of study\"). Using \"temple\" instead of \"synagogue\" is common in the Reform Movement. These items are necessary to make a space a synagogue: a Torah scroll, and ark in which to store it, and a NerTamid (eternal light) over the ark. In some synagogues, the ark is designed to recall the biblical Tabernacle: the portable dwelling place for the divine presence built to specifications revealed to Moses at Sinai. A Sukkah is a temporary hut constructed for use during the week-long Jewish festival of Sukkot. The Temple Mount in Jerusalem is the remainder of the structure built during the reign of biblical King Solomon, and destroyed by the Romans in 70 ce. governance (Judicatory) There is no Chief Rabbi in the United States; there is no umbrella organization uniting all U.S. Jews. Each denomination or movement has a national office that sets policy, and performs administrative or disciplinary functions for its Rabbis. governance (congregation) Governance of the local congregation falls to its Board of Directors. Many synagogues are affiliated with one of major denominations, and receive guidance from its headquarters; some are completely independent. In Hasidic Judaism, each sect/denomination has a Rebbe (Senior Rabbi) who governs the entire community and its junior Rabbis. Point of contact Local: Synagogues Regional: Within denominations, there are regional associations of rabbis. Also, many Jewish Federations manage or oversee a board of rabbis with will generally include rabbis from the major sects of Judaism, outside of Orthodox and Hasidic.

A Cantor (Chazzan) is a music-leader for congregational worship, and has training similar to that for rabbis. In the Reform, Conservative, and Reconstructionist movements, women can be ordained as rabbis and cantors. Hasidic sects call their leaders \"Rebbes.\" Their training and authority differs from that of rabbis ordained in the Reform, Conservative, and Reconstructionist movements. religious objects/symbols Torah scroll. Menorah (many-branched Kippah (yarmulke): skullcap worn by observant males, and some females. Mezuzah: a small case containing verses from Deuteronomy, and attached to doorposts of Jewish residences and businesses. Tefillin (phylacteries): a prayer aid comprising a black box containing verses from Deuteronomy, and straps for fastening the box to one's forehead and one's left arm during Morning Prayer; used by Orthodox men and some Orthodox women, and by some men and some women in the other Jewish movements. Facilitating Practices Discuss expected observances occurring during shelter/hospital/care center stay with individual/patient/family. Be aware that there are several approaches to observing Jewish dietary laws, even among the very Orthodox. Facilitators should determine the degree to which this person \"keeps kosher\" (requires food complying with Jewish dietary laws), thus what their specific requirements are. culture & social interactionThis will differ broadly from denomination to denomination. Even within the Orthodox category there is considerable range. gender roles/interaction Orthodox Judaism limits leadership to men, although women within the Modern Orthodox Movement have challenged this. Only men may become Orthodox rabbis and cantors, although in recent years, some women have sought equivalent training. Among Orthodox Jews, many avoid physical contact with persons beyond their immediate family of the opposite gender. Couples may avoid physical contact during the wife's menstrual period. The Reform, Conservative, and Reconstructionist Movements all are quite egalitarian, as is the Humanistic Jewish movement. Both women and men may be ordained as rabbis and cantors. Cross-gender contact is allowed. Some couples take on the practice of avoiding physical contact during the wife's menstrual period. JUdAism94 Religious liteRacy PRimeR \u00a9 NDIN 2014 v .1Principal Weekly observance(s)Shabbat (Sabbath or Shabbos) is observed from 17 minutes before sundown on Friday until an hour past sundown on Saturday. Orthodox and some Reconstructionist Jews observe the timings very strictly. Reform and Conservative Jews may be less strict about the timing of Shabbat, preferring to have observances start and end at the same time every week. All Shabbat observance may be home-based, with opening and closing rituals to be performed by the family. Some Jews attend a Friday evening service called Kabballat Shabbat (Shabbat Welcome), which is joyous and prayer filled. A Saturday Shabbat Service is longer; its focus is the chanting of the Torah portion for the week; a sermon will also be given. A Havdalah service marks the end of Shabbat, and includes wine, spices, prayer, and a special multi-wicked candle. Some Jewish congregations hold educational programs at the synagogue on Sundays. Traditional Jewish weekly observance includes Torah reading at Morning Prayer in the synagogue on Mondays and Thursdays. daily religious Practices Observant Jews say formal prayers three times a day (morning, noon, evening). \"Laying tefillin\" (making use of the prayer aids comprising two small boxes containing passages from Deuteromy, with long leather straps for tying to one's forehead and one's left arm) is part of the Morning Prayer ritual. holy days/Festivals The observance of festivals is very important. The major ones are: Rosh ha-Shanah (New Year), Days of Awe (period of introspection between Rosh ha-Shanah and Yom Kippur), Yom Kippur (Day of Atonement\u2014a day set aside for fasting, depriving oneself of pleasures, and repenting from the sins of the previous year). Sukkot (Feast of Booths\u2014a festival commemorating the wandering in the desert and the final harvest). Simchat Torah (celebration of the receipt of the Torah). Chanukah (Feast of Light). Purim (celebration of Queen Esther's rescue of the Jewish people). Pesach (Passover\u2014commemorating the exodus from Egypt). Shavuot (Feast of Weeks\u2014a festival commemorating the giving of the Torah and the harvest of the first fruits). rituals/ceremonies Brit Milah (\"Bris\") is a Jewish circumcision ceremony performed on eight day-old male infants by a mohel. At this time the baby is also named. The birth of girls is often celebrated among Reform and Conservative Jews with a Simchat Bat ceremony, where the baby is welcomed into the community and given her name. Bar Mitzvah and Bat Mitzvah: reaching the age of b'nai mitzvah signifies becoming a full-fledged member of the Jewish Community with the respon-sibilities that come with it. In recent years, Jewish girls participate in a similar ceremony when they turn twelve years old. Marriage: On a spiritual level, Jewish marriage is understood to mean that the husband and wife are merging into a single soul. Marriages involves a legal contract called a ketubah. JUdAism\u00a9 NDIN 2014 v .1 v.1 \u00a9 NDIN 2014 Religious liteRacy PRimeR 95dress (religious restrictions)Many U.S. Jews dress in ways indistinguishable from the general public. Some Orthodox Jews dress in distinctive ways that identify them, not only as Orthodox Jews, but as members of some particular sect within Orthodox Judaism. Observant Jewish men and women will keep their heads covered at all times. Men may wear a hat or skull-cap (the yarmulka or kippa) or both. Married Orthodox women will wear a hat, scarf or wig (or a wig plus a hat or scarf). They will appreciate provisions keeping their hair covered when hospitalized. Orthodox women and girls are required to keep the body and limbs covered with modest clothing, and always wear a dress or skirt (never trousers). Many will appreciate hospital gowns that allow them to preserve their modesty. Certain sects of Orthodox men are likely to wear black clothes (sometimes 18 th century dress), grow the forelocks of their hair long (as ringlets called payot or payos), and maintain full beards. death: dying Practices Jewish beliefs about dying run the gamut from the notion that one's soul returns to heaven as the body returns to the dust of the earth, to a notion that nothing persist after physical death. Jews endeavor to die (or to allow death) with dignity. It is usual for a companion to remain with a dying Jewish person until death, reading Psalms; the Shema or the Vidui (confession) might be recited as well. Some Jews believe that the dying person should not be touched or moved, since such action might hasten death, which is not permitted. Jewish ethicists have defined death as occurring when respiration and circulation have ceased irreversibly. Few Orthodox Jews acknowledge \"brain death,\" neither do many Conservative Jews. death: culture/Practices Once death has come, the concern is that the body be accorded dignity. Some Jewish legal interpreters condone donation of a body to a medical school only if all parts will be given a proper Jewish burial when no longer needed. Some Orthodox and Conservative Jews do not approve of autopsy, unless required by law or the life of a specific person depends on it (for example, if it might yield information about a hereditary illness, thus saving a family member). Some Orthodox and Conservative Jews may request return of all body parts and fluids be returned after autopsy for burial. Some Orthodox families may request that their rabbi observe the autopsy. Particularly in the case of Orthodox Jews, the family should be consulted before medical personnel give postmortem care. The family may prefer that designated individuals from the Jewish community wash the body and prepare it for burial; they may prefer a funeral home familiar with Jewish belief and ritual. Organ donation is a personal choice. The Jewish comfort level with organ donation has increased significantly (even among Orthodox Jews) as medical procedures have been refined, and the donor (or the family) can be assured that it will be used to help someone. JUdAism96 Religious liteRacy PRimeR \u00a9 NDIN 2014 v .1death: Body Preparation Immediately after death a Chevra Kadisha (Holy Fellowship) should be notified; they will arrange for funeral before sunset on the day of death, if possible, but will not move the body on the Sabbath. The body should not be moved any more than absolutely necessary, out of respect. The body should be attended constantly from death until burial. It customary to have a shomer or shomera (guard) sit by the body and recite psalms. Body parts must be treated with respect and remain with the corpse if possible. Any clothing, dressings or medical equipment containing any of the deceased person's blood must be buried with the corpse. The body is to be wrapped in a simple white shroud, although Jews have elaborate rituals for doing so. The body is to be buried in a plain wooden coffin, not cremated. dietary laws and customs Observant Jews uphold Kashrut (Jewish dietary law); also known as \"keeping kosher.\" Pork is not permissible in any form. Seafood with both fins and scales is permissible; shellfish is not permitted. Red meat and poultry must come from an animal slaughtered in accordance with kosher standards. Meat and milk products must not be cooked or consumed together; separate sets of cookware and dishes must be kept for each. Milk products must not be eaten during or after a meat meal, and many observant Jews will wait three to six hours before dairy products are eaten or drunk following a meal containing meat. Many non-orthodox Jews who keep kosher will find a vegetarian meal, even if cooked in a non-kosher kitchen, acceptable. Alcohol is allowed; wine is used in various Jewish observances. Some Jews will only drink Kosher wine. Fasting plays a role in Jewish observance. Yom Kippur is a major annual 25-hour fast from food and drink observed by the majority of Jews. The Jewish calendar includes other fast days that are less widely observed. During the period of Passover, no leavened bread is eaten; unleavened bread known as matzah may be consumed instead. There are several agencies that certify food as kosher. In caring for an observant Jew, it is important to inquire which guidelines they follow. Many will only eat food that they receive in a container marked with the seal they recognize. health (medical care) The Talmud requires Jews to live in a community in which healthcare is available, offered, and can be received. Jews take seriously the notion of pikuah nefesh (preservation of life). Therefore, in general, Judaism imposes no restriction on use of conventional or state-of-the art medical options. With regard to illness, Judaism recognizes the tension between the desire for cure and the recognition that the need to come to terms with the larger process of which illness is a part. According to the Talmud, one should not hasten death, neither should one postpone it artificially. So, some Jews will disdain feeding tubes, respirators, and other heroic measures on this basis. Jewish ethicists stress that patients should not be made to suffer unnecessary pain. JUdAism\u00a9 NDIN 2014 v .1 v.1 \u00a9 NDIN 2014 Religious liteRacy PRimeR 97health (mental health) Generally, Jews are open to conventional mental health care options. Pregnancy and Birth Many Jews, especially the Orthodox, believe that a miscarried fetus should be buried. Birth control is permitted, except among Orthodox Jews. Artificial insemination permitted (although perhaps not among some Orthodox Jews). Jews believe that abortion is not only acceptable, but mandatory to save a woman's life. While Orthodox Jews prohibit abortion in nearly all other cases, Conservative Jews allow it in limited circumstances while Reform Jews permit it in a wider range of cases. For service Providers Physical contact Orthodox men and women (especially members of Ultra-Orthodox or Hasidic sects) actively avoid physical contact (such as shaking hands) with people of the opposite gender. Such Jews will not welcome being comforted by being hugged or touched by someone of the opposite gender who is not a family member. dietary restrictions Jews who observe Jewish dietary laws should be asked about their specific approach to keeping kosher. Some will expect food certified by their preferred agency. Some will opt for a vegetarian diet as an alternative. medical t reatment Some Orthodox will not wish to be touched by a care provider of the opposite gender; others will allow it on the basis that saving a life supersedes other concerns. Unless surgical procedure is immediately necessary for preservation of life, may be avoided during Sabbath or other holy days. However, all laws normally applying on the Sabbath or festival can be overruled for the purpose of saving life or safeguarding health. Blood transfusion is permitted and is a matter of personal choice. Transplants and organ donation are usually permissible, but may require advice from a rabbi. mental health care Generally, Jews are open to conventional mental health care options. mass care Facilities A quiet area for prayer should be provided if possible. Provision should be made for an Orthodox woman so that she will not be made to sleep in a space in which men (other than her husband) are present. Sensitivity to kosher food requirements will be much appreciated. A place to wash hands outside of the restroom is important for Orthodox Jews.

Founder Ancient traditions; no record of founder-names. Branches & denominations Numerous branches. Native American Religion takes at least four forms: Embrace of a denomination of Christianity, but retain some tribal religious traditions. Practice of one's own tribal tradition exclusively (and there are many distinct traditions (e.g. Hopi, Din\u00e9, Lakota, Ojibwe). Embrace of a New Religious Movement (e.g. Native America Church), which synthesizes aspects of Christianity with aspects of indigenous practice and belief. Embrace of \"pan-Indian\" or \"trans-tribal\" spirituality, integrating aspects of the religions of various indigenous peoples' nations. Basic t enets Particular Native American systems of belief and practice are unique, and deserve to be appreciated as such. A few commonalities can be discerned, however: Recollection of many sacred narratives that are rich with the symbolism of seasons, weather, plants, animals, earth, water, sky, and fire. The principle of an all-embracing, universal and omniscient Great Spirit, a connection to the Earth, diverse creation narratives and collective memories of ancient ancestors are common. Traditional worship practices include dance, songs, and trance. sacred t exts America's Native American religions are narrative-based rather than scripture-based. Sacred narratives have been passed on from generation to generation. However, many of these narratives have been committed to writing. sacred Buildings/ structures Some Native Americans favor construction of a building in which to conduct ceremonies and meetings. Others favor use of a designated outdoor space. Several tribes\u2014Oglala Lakota, Din\u00e9 (Navajo), Potawatomi, Keetowah, and others\u2014make use of a sweat lodge as a form of prayer and meditation. This practice may also involve chanting.

Religious articles carried by elders must not be touched by anyone other than the elder; if inspection is required, an elder should be invited to provide inspection services. A woman should not come near sacred objects during menstruation. Facilitating Practices Native Americans will appreciate being given permission and space to conduct their ceremonies (especially those related to healing and death). culture & social interactionVaries broadly. gender roles/interaction Women may have significant leadership roles. Some traditions provide rites of passage unique to young women. Many traditions ask women to stay out of the ceremony-circle when menstruating (because of the belief that women are too powerful at that time). Principal Weekly observance(s)Some groups meet weekly for ceremonies or to conduct a sweat lodge. Some conduct ceremonies on full moon days. daily religious Practices The details of daily practice vary from one tradition to the next. holy days/Festivals Native American/Indigenous religions have seasonal ceremonies throughout the year. They are invariably tied to the cycles of nature. Keetoowah (Cherokee), for example, hold an annual Green Corn Festival and Ripe Corn Festival (Thanksgiving). Keetoowah hold festivals annually for other reasons as well: Atahuna is held for reconciliation and forgiveness; and Busk, for purification. Uku is the Priest's Festival. nAtive Americ An/Americ An indigenoUs religion\u00a9 NDIN 2014 .1 v.1 \u00a9 NDIN 2014 Religious liteRacy PRimeR 101rituals/ceremonies May be performed with intent of seeing, understanding, or obtaining a vision of clarity of oneself and individual issues in order to relate to oneself and others. Prayer accompanied by burning of sacred plants, i.e. sweet grass, sage, cedar or tobacco. Many First Nations also hold rites of passage. Most hold birth ceremonies to mark the proper start of the child down the path of life. Initiation ceremonies once marked the onset of puberty for Native American boys and girls, which lasted over several days and in some cases, several months. Many of these ceremonies are no longer practiced due to the constraints of modern life; others have been revived. Marriage ceremonies have traditionally been community celebrations focusing on the participants and impressing the importance of the new stage of life they are entering. Celebrations for Northwest coastal peoples take the form of a potlatch, a gift-giving festival and primary economic system practiced by indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast of Canada and United States. A grand occasion for feasting to celebrate occasions like the birth of a child or a rite-of-passage, potlatch includes traditional singing and dancing, and lots of traditional food. For certain Northwest peoples, the dancing makes use of large, elaborate masks. dress (religious restrictions)No religiously mandated everyday dress. However, for ceremonies and dances, special clothing is necessary, and sometimes needs to be earned. These garments should be treated with respect. death: dying Practices Broad variation. death: culture/Practices Funerals are believed by many Native Americans to be the beginning of another journey into the next world. Since one's spirit needs help to make this journey, strict rules often govern the behavior of the living relatives of the deceased to ensure that their loved one starts this journey successfully. death: Body Preparation America's various First Nations each have unique burial customs, but many prefer to lay out the body of the deceased for several days before burial. Lakota are one of the groups that prefer to lay out the body of the deceased. When the day for it comes, the burial usually happens in the afternoon, followed by a big feed, and giving away the deceased's possessions. During a Mohawk home-wake, someone keeps watch over the body at all times. Because members of the deceased's clan are in mourning, they are not permitted to touch the body, or do the grave-digging, which must be performed by someone outside the clan. Cherokee traditionally kept the body of the deceased in their home for four days, while conducting ceremonies for the lingering life force of the deceased. The body is washed. Some people still paint the face black and red. While burial is more traditional, many Native people now prefer to be cremated, so that there is no body to exhume and study, as has happened to Native Americans in the recent past. dietary laws and customs Varies broadly from one tradition to the next. nAtive Americ An/Americ An indigenoUs religion102 Religious liteRacy PRimeR \u00a9 NDIN 2014 v .1health (medical care) General comfort for conventional medical care options, but a preference for traditional healing methods at the same time. May believe that ill health results from not living in harmony or being out of balance with nature and social and supernatural environments. Members of many tribes and nations express serious discomfort at the notion of organ transplantation. In many traditions, it is the custom to save lost teeth, amputated limbs, and surgically removed organs for eventual burial with the body. health (mental heath) Some willingness to accept conventional mental health care options. Pregnancy and Birth Pregnant woman are generally included in religious ceremonies until delivery. Many Native traditions provide ceremonies for baby-welcoming in which the baby is welcomed on the sacred path, named, and celebrated as a new member of the tribe. Zuni show the baby to the sun for the first time on the eighth day; Hopi do this on the 20 th day. Kwakiutl and Haida of the Pacific Northwest hold a baby-naming in the context of a potlatch. Navajo babies become full members of the tribe four days after they laugh for the first time.

Scientology views life in compartmentalized urges (drives, impulses) toward survival. These are called \"dynamics\" and there are eight in all. It puts forth a long list of inalienable human rights that \"no agency less than God has the power to suspend.\" Scientology beliefs revolve around a notion of the thetan\u2014the individualized expression of the cosmic source, or life force, named after the Greek letter theta. The thetan is the true identity of a person\u2014an intrinsically good, omniscient, non-material core capable of unlimited creativity. Thetans are reborn time and time again in new bodies through a process called \"assumption\" which is analogous to reincarnation. Scientology posits a causal relationship between the experiences of earlier incarnations and one's present life, and with each rebirth, the effects of the MEST universe (matter, energy, space, and time) on the thetan become stronger. sacred t exts Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health by L.

It will then find another physical body to inhabit. The soul does not undergo judgment. The reincarnation process is automatic. Therefore, death is a sad occasion, but it also considered liberating. death: culture/Practices Given the Scientology tenet that the body is mortal but the spirit is immortal, and given the minister's role in comforting those bereaved by loss, a funeral ceremony serves to end the cycle of the life passed and focus on the future.. death: Body Preparation Scientologists may bury or cremate their dead. scientologY\u00a9 NDIN 2014 v .1 v.1 \u00a9 NDIN 2014 Religious liteRacy PRimeR 105dietary laws and customs No dietary restrictions. health (medical care) Scientology encourages the use of the full range of conventional medical treatment options.

Pregnancy and Birth The Church of Scientology does not mandate a position on abortion or birth control. Founder L.

Abortion is therefore rare among Scientologists, who recognize that even an unborn fetus may already be occupied by a spiritual being. In some instances, however, abortion might be an option owing to health concerns for the mother or other personal factors. Scientology advises silent birth, a procedure advised by L.

Humanity and bodily life are fundamentally good\u2014as are sexuality and fertility. The focus is on life, and on counteracting anything that brings sickness and death. Not only should physical pollutants be removed, but human relationships likewise should be kept healthy and pure. Shinto emphasizes sincerity, fulfillment of obligations, and apology for errors. Shinto teaches that Kami (superiors, deities) are everywhere, and are personified, named, and approached with reverence. Kami may be nature spirits, familial ancestors, or the spirits deceased emperors, saints, or heroes. Kami are the central objects of worship for the Shinto faith. Some Shinto practices are home-centered. The family maintains a kamidan (a home shrine) inside the house or in the garden, and makes offerings of rice and water to the resident kami. Each jinja (Shinto shrine) has a kami\u2014which may be a natural object or a famous person. Two of the most famous jinja in Japan are Ise (the Sun Goddess Shrine) and Tsubaki (the Earth God Shrine). Another Tsubaki Shrine is located in Granite Falls, WA. Shrine worship has four components: purification, offering, prayer, and (occasionally) symbolic feasting by drinking rice wine. Some shrines house a sacred object, but these remain hidden. If a shrine has a building, it is likely to have a small hall in which the kami resides (and which is off limits to visitors) and a larger hall where prayers may be said. Purity\u2014Shinto teaches that certain deeds create a kind of ritual impurity that one should want cleansed for one's own peace of mind and good fortune rather than because impurity is wrong. Wrong deeds are called impurity. Purification rites are a vital part of Shinto. They are done on a daily, weekly, seasonal, lunar, and annual basis. Torii (Shrine Gate) 108 Religious liteRacy PRimeR \u00a9 NDIN 2014 v .1sacred t exts Shinto has no official scriptures. The narratives of Shinto oral tradition began to take written form in the 8 th century CE. Kojiki is the chronicle of ancient events.

Once a perch for sacred birds, it now is a gateway of honor. To pass through a tori is to make the first step to purification. A haraigushi (wand) is used to order to sweep away stagnation. Facilitating Practices None specifically. culture & social interaction Many Shinto Followers in the U.S. are Japanese or Japanese-American.

Shinto provides ceremonies for girls and women, as well as for boys and men. Principal Weekly observance(s)Shinto-Followers gather on Full Moon days (rather than weekly) for a special ceremony. Some may come together weekly for Aikido instruction, which is seen as a spiritual discipline. daily religious Practice The Shinto priest's daily routine involves gishiki (Shinto ceremony). Chohai (daily ritual) begins early in the morning with self-purification, then ritual purification of the shrine grounds and building, food offerings for the kami, and an invitation to the kami to perform cleansing action. The Shinto day begins and ends with gratitude. shinto\u00a9 NDIN 2014 v .1 v.1 \u00a9 NDIN 2014 Religious liteRacy PRimeR 109holy days/Festivals For Shinto-followers, the annual cycle includes celebrations and commemorations virtually every month. Koshinsatsu Takeagehiki is the annual Shinto festival of purification by burning, early in the year. It is the time for Shinto-followers to remove old ritual objects and charms from their household shrines and exchange them for fresh ones. There is a bonfire ceremony in which used items are burned. In early February comes Setsubun (Old Japanese Lunar New Year), which marks the end of winter. On this day, it is customary for people to throw soy beans, to shoo away bad fortune and invoke the good. There are many other annual Shinto festivals. rituals/ceremonies Rites of passage may also be held at the shrine. The Shichi-Go-San, (Seven-Five-Three) is a rite of passage for five-year-old boys and three-year-old or seven-year-old girls. It is a time for these young children to personally offer thanks for the Kami's protection and to pray for the continuance of healthy growing. dress (religious restrictions)None for layperson, except during certain rituals. The priest has special ceremonial garb which is loosely based on the kimono and is black and white. death: dying Practices When a Shinto-follower is dying, it is quite common for the family to arrange for a Buddhist funeral. death: culture/Practices While it is quite common to turn to Buddhism when a loved one dies, Shinto does have a funeral ceremony (called a shinsosai), and the Tsubaki Shrine of North America has performed many. A Shinto funeral is a series of ceremonies, beginning with a vigil, during which the mitama (soul) gets used to the idea of not being alive anymore. As well, the vigil acknowledges that, though this person is dead and is not coming back, family and friends sense that the mitama is still there. Next comes the senrei-sai, the ceremony of transferring the mitama from the body to a mitama-shiro, a specially prepared memorial plaque. Then comes the shinsosai\u2014the funeral ceremony itself, performed in front of the memorial plaque. Finally, there is a ceremony for seeing the body off at the time of cremation, and another ceremony for the people returning home. Traditionally, Shinto funeral ceremonies will take place in the home of the deceased person rather than in the shrine. However, some rituals for the dead can be, and often are, performed on the Grand Tsubaki Shrine grounds. Special precautions are necessary, however, because the items used in the ceremony and the garb worn by the priest must be kept away from the main shrine building. death: Body Preparation American Shinto-followers try to avoid embalming by opting for cremation. Customarily, the ashes are buried rather than sprinkled or spread - and never near the Shinto shrine. dietary laws and customs Nothing specific. shinto110 Religious liteRacy PRimeR \u00a9 NDIN 2014 v .1health (medical care) In general, American Shinto-followers are comfortable with many of the options conventional Western health care offers. However, because Shinto is a life-affirming worldview whose main focus is cleanliness and purity, and since terminal illness and death connote impurity and negativity, Shinto-followers may turn to Buddhism for help in dealing with them. On the other hand, Shinto can help its followers be matter-of-fact and accepting in their approach to terminal illness, facing it with a traditional adage: \"it cannot be helped.\" This absolves the patient of any blame or feeling of failure. Generally, Shinto is not in favor of organ transplantation because it is contrary to the natural process. Shinto teaches that the body wants to return to nature; it wants to decompose, and the mitama (soul) wants to be on its way. Shinto values the ongoing relationship between the person who died and the family and friends left behind. Shinto-followers may be concerned this relationship will be damaged or disrupted by cutting into a corpse for autopsy or organ-harvesting. health (mental health) Many American Shinto-Followers will be comfortable with standard mental health care options. Pregnancy and Birth When a Shinto-Follower gives birth, the infant is brought into the shrine to be initiated as a new believer to receive the Kami's blessing. For service Providers Physical contact No specific concerns. dietary restrictions No particular restrictions. medical t reatment Many Western-style medical options will generally be acceptable. Conversations about making or receiving an organ donation will need to be handled with care.

(Worship) Punjabi/Gurmukhi Founder Guru Nanak (1469-1539) Branches & denominations Many U.S. Sikhs are part of the mainline tradition from the Punjab; followers of Yogi Bhajan may be considered a separate denomination. Basic t enets Sikhism is a monotheistic religion, which originated in northern India. While its original context included both Hindus and Muslims, members see it as a distinct religion (not a blend of Hinduism and Islam, or an offshoot of either). Sikhs believe that God is imminent; nothing in this creation is devoid of or distinct from God's essence. God is omnipresent, transcdendent, omnipotent, and omniscient. Emphasis is placed on ethics, morality, and values. Sikhs believe in Samsara, Karma, and Reincarnation, but also believe that birth as a human is a rare opportunity; one is to make the best of one's present lifetime. The Sikh lifestyle is summarized as: work hard and earn an honest living, remember God, and share the fruits of one's labors with those in need. Sikh teaching emphasizes the principle of equality of all humans and rejects discrimination on the basis of caste, creed, and gender. sacred t exts Guru Granth Sahib is the holy scripture of Sikhism. It is a collection of writings of Guru Nanak (the founder), many of the nine human gurus who followed him as leaders of the community, and selections from the writings of a few Hindu and Muslim holy persons. Sikhism's Tenth Guru declared the Guru Granth Sahib to the \"Living Guru\" for Sikhs; there will be no more human gurus. All copies of the Guru Granth Sahib are paginated identically. As the living teacher of the community, any copy of the Guru Granth Sahib is to be accorded the respect and care due royalty, which includes ceremonially awakening it each day, attending it when it is outside its \"bedroom,\" and ceremonially putting it to bed each evening. The Rehat Maryada (Sikh Code of Conduct) is the source of guidance in details of Sikh law and practice. sacred Buildings/ structuresSikh houses of worship are called gurdwaras; sometimes they are referred to as temples. Typically, a gurdwara includes a commercial kitchen as well as a hall for community worship and meals (langar hall). Khanda 112 Religious liteRacy PRimeR \u00a9 NDIN The Akal Takhat (located in Amritsar, Punjab) is the highest juridical authority for Sikhs worldwide; this office has the authority to issue edicts to provide guidance or clarification on any matter of Sikh doctrine or practice. It can also issue reprimands. governance (congregation) Each gurdwara (temple) is independently governed by a board of directors. Point of contact Local: Gurdwara, led by a board of directors Regional: N/A National: The World Sikh Council - America Region religious leaders Sikhism has no clergy. Anyone may fill any role in worship. A scholar of Sikhism (gyani or giani) or the head of a gurdwara's board of directors may also be considered a Sikh religious leader. The worship leader is called the Granthi (the one who tends the sacred scripture). Granthi may also mean someone with deep knowledge of the scriptures, able to teach others about it. A musician may be called a ragi (one who knows the ragas/melodies). religious objects/symbols Sikhs typically wear the Five Ks (panjkakaar)\u2014five articles of faith (the names for which all begin with the letter K); initiated Sikhs (also called Khalsa Sikhs) must wear the Five Ks at all times. They are: Kesh (uncut hair, tied and wrapped in a dastara/Sikh Turban). Kanga (wooden comb, worn under the turban). Kachchera (cotton underwear). Kara (an iron bracelet, worn on the right wrist). Kirpan (a curved dagger, symbolizing commitment to justice). Other Sikh symbols include: Ik Onkar: the opening words, in elegant Gurmukhi script of the Mool Mantra (the first page of the Sikh holy book), which means \"One with Everything\" (implying \"Creation is in the Creator\"). Khanda: symbol comprising a double-edged sword (khanda) representing belief in one God; the Chakkar, an unbroken circle representing God's eternity; two crossed kirpans (daggers) representing spiritual authority and political power. Nishan Sahib: saffron triangular flag bearing with the Khanda symbol is flown above every gurdwara. Facilitating Practices Provide privacy for daily prayers. Respect wearing religious objects; do not remove them without permission; do not demand that an observant Sikh remove any of the Five Ks (articles of faith). culture & social interactionSikhs focus on the idea that human beings must work for a living and play an active role in society. The guiding principles of the Sikh faith are Truth, Equality, Freedom, Justice, and Karma. Therefore, they will often seek out ways to be helpful to those in need. gender roles/interaction Sikhism teaches egalitarianism and a leveling of caste distinctions. Therefore, the role and place of women should be parallel to that of men, but preferences for men in leadership roles may be present in communities.siKh FAith\u00a9 NDIN 2014 v .1 v.1 \u00a9 PRimeR 113Principal Weekly observance(s)In the Punjab, visiting the Gurdwara can be part of one's daily routine; Sikh communities in the U.S. usually establish a pattern for meeting weekly for a prayer service. Sikh communal worship features devotional singing of hymns taken from the Sikh holy book, using traditional melodies and accompanied by harmoniums and tabors; a reading from scripture (chosen at random), and a discourse explaining it or some particular tenet of the faith, and the Ardas (standing prayer). Toward the end of the service, karahprashad (a lump of sweet pudding) will be distributed. After the service, worshipers adjourn to the langar hall for a community meal, traditionally eaten sitting in rows on the floor. daily religious Practices Devout Sikhs say five prayers each morning, one prayer in the evening, and one prayer at bedtime. Each of these prayer times concludes with recitation of the Ardas (the standing prayer which is also said in Sikh communal worship). holy days/Festivals Sikhs follow a modified lunar calendar. The Sikh year includes six primary holidays. All holidays follow a similar pattern of celebration: three days of worship, with special food distributed free from the langar. The dates for commemorating the birth of each of the ten gurus are distributed throughout the year. Those of the founder (Guru Nanak) and of the tenth guru (Guru Gobind Singh) are especially important. Baisaki is a commemoration of the formation of the Khalsa in 1699. Guru Granth Day celebrates the proclamation that the Sikh scripture is the perpetual living Guru. rituals/ceremonies Sikhs participate in daily and weekly prayer services, which include ceremonial waking, enthroning, and retiring the Guru Granth Sahib each day. Khande-di-Pahul (sometimes called \"taking amrit\") is perhaps the most important occasional Sikh ceremony. This is a pre-dawn ritual of initiation (sometimes called Sikh baptism). It involves preparation of sweetened water, which is sprinkled on the initiative, and drunk by those participating in the ceremony. Amritdhara (initiated) Sikhs are considered members of the Khalsa (society of the pure) and commit themselves to performance of the daily prayers and wearing of the five articles of faith. dress (religious restrictions)Many (including children) wear the Five Ks (articles of faith). Kesh (uncut hair, tied and wrapped in a dastara/Sikh Turban). Kachchera (cotton underwear). A devout Sikh may wish to have begun to step into the fresh undergarment before completely removing the old one, thus never being completely without it. Kara (an iron bracelet, worn on the right wrist). Devout Sikhs never remove the bracelet from their wrist. Kirpan (a curved dagger, symbolizing commitment to justice). Devout Sikhs prefer not to remove their kirpan; however, some will do so under certain circumstances, and others substitute a dagger-charm on a necklace. Kanga (wooden comb, worn under the turban). The Kanga is kept with the hair and used twice per day.siKh FAith114 Religious liteRacy PRimeR \u00a9 NDIN 2014 v .1death: dying Practices As death approaches, Sikhs are encouraged to focus on prayer, which may be sung or read, in the belief that saying prayers while the soul is leaving will help that the soul get to God faster. The Sikh family will want to be present when the death is declared, or when they feel that the soul is leaving. Those working with Sikh families should make an attempt to accommodate this. death: culture/Practices Sikhism teaches that once the soul leaves the body, the body becomes less important as it was merely the repository for the soul. While the body is to be treated with dignity, it is ultimately something to dispose of. At the funeral home, prior to cremation, Sikhs will say the Sohila (the night prayer, but also a reminder of death), to encourage the soul to leave its home and go eternally forward. After cremation, family and friends go to the gurdwara, where the community will say the Ardas (standing prayer), the main prayer of Sikh worship. There may also be singing of hymns focusing on the constant need for self-preparation, so that the soul will be prepared (when the time comes) to leave and to go on its journey. death: Body Preparation Traditionally, Sikhs will bring the body of a deceased family member home, where it will be bathed in milk and water by family members of the same gender, and cremated very soon after death. While waiting for the time of cremation, the prepared body is placed on the floor, where family members attend it until time for the funeral. Prayers are recited continuously; if necessary, family members will sleep on the floor next to the body. In the U.S. it is typical to postpone the funeral for a day or two, or longer, to allow family to come travel. The family may even hold a \"viewing.\" Delaying the funeral makes embalming necessary, which is a change to traditional Sikh practice. dietary laws and customs Sikhs are forbidden from eating meat killed in a ritualistic or religiously prescribed manner by throat-cutting (as is the case with kosher and halal meat). Forbidden meat is called Kutha meat; permitted meat is called Jhatka meat. Meals served from a Gurdwara's langar are to be completely vegetarian. Sikhs are forbidden from bringing meat of any kind into the langar. Consumption of alcohol, drugs, tobacco, and other intoxicants is forbidden. health (medical care) Generally, Sikhs are open to all conventional and state-of-the-art medical treatment options. Observant Sikhs never cut their hair; initiated Sikhs have taken a vow to never cut the hair on any part of their body. Therefore, medical procedures which require any degree of hair-shaving can be deeply upsetting to an observant Sikh. Observant Sikhs wear a special undergarment, and may finding it upsetting if it is necessary to remove it or go without during medical care. Observant Sikhs who wear a turban will prefer to remove it themselves (when absolutely necessary), and will want the cloth stored respectfully. They will want to keep their hair covered with an under-turban, and will appreciate cooperation from the medical care team on this matter. siKh FAith\u00a9 NDIN 2014 v .1 v.1 \u00a9 NDIN 2014 Religious liteRacy PRimeR 115health (mental health) Generally, Sikhs are open to conventional mental healthcare options. The religion encourages use of prayer and meditation in dealing with depression, anxiety, and other mental illnesses. Pregnancy and Birth Sikh women are encouraged to read and recite Sikh scriptures daily during pregnancy. The Rehat Maryada (Code of Conduct) explicitly forbids ritual housecleaning for purification after childbirth, because it rejects all traditional notions that childbirth causes pollution. Sikh baby-welcoming ceremonies are spelled out in the Rehat Maryada: Soon after the baby is born, the Mool Mantra (the summary of Sikh faith) is whispered in its ear, and a drop of honey is placed on its tongue. The mother is encouraged to pray or meditate or chant Waheguru (Almighty God) while the baby nurses. Whenever the newborn's mother feels ready she and her family take Karhah Prasad (sacred pudding) to the gurdwara for a joyful ceremony of hymn-singing and prayer. A portion of scripture is read. The Granthi (the person attending the holy book) announces the first letter of the reading; the congregation accepts it; and the parents choose a name for the child, which begins with that letter. Closing prayers are recited, and Karhah Prashad is distributed to everyone. Abortion is not directly addressed in scripture but generally forbidden as it is seen as interference in the creative work of God. Exceptions are made in circumstances where the life or health of the mother is in serious jeopardy or the fetus has serious defects that will not allow it to survive beyond birth. Birth control is also not directly addressed by scripture; rather couples are left to decide whether to use family planning and which method to choose. For service Providers Physical contact No religion-prescribed restrictions. dietary restrictions Observant Sikhs are forbidden from eating halal or kosher meat. Sikhs may eat meat slaughtered by conventional methods. Some Sikhs are vegetarian by choice. Consumption of alcohol, drugs, tobacco, and other intoxicants is forbidden. medical t reatment Generally, Sikhs are open to conventional and state-of-the-art healthcare options. Observant Sikhs who have unshorn hair will find shaving in preparation for medical procedures to be deeply upsetting. Observant Sikhs will want to continue to wear the Five Ks (articles of faith) as best they can during hospitalization. A turban-wearing Sikh who must remove their turban for a medical procedure will want the cloth to be stored respectfully. mental health care Generally, Sikhs are open to conventional mental healthcare options. mass care Facilities Sikhs will appreciate a place to meditate and say daily prayers. It is unlikely that a copy of the Sikh holy book will be brought to a mass care facility; however, if that situation were to present itself, Sikhs will appreciate cooperation with their effort to store it and protect it according to Sikh Law. Mixed gender concerns may stem from practices found in Indian culture, rather than in Sikhism itself. It is important to be aware that sensitivity to gender mixing may be present.siKh FAith116 Religious liteRacy PRimeR \u00a9 NDIN 2014 v .1THIS PAGE WAS INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK\u00a9 NDIN 2014 v .1 v.1 \u00a9 NDIN 2014 Religious liteRacy PRimeR 117tAOISM (pronounced \"dou-iz-uhm\") Adherents consider themselves tAoist/dAoist.

Branches & denominations Many; American Taoism/Daoism takes a variety of forms. Many Taoists/Daoists in America are adherents of some form of Chinese Daoism transplanted to the U.S. Fewer are part of a New Religious Movement sometimes labeled Popular Western Taoism by observers; this is better described as a modern construction of a Taoism-based religion (rather than part of the historic Taoist/Daoist tradition). Basic t enets Taoism is both a complex system of indigenous Chinese beliefs, rituals, and practices, and a highly influential school of Chinese philosophy. Some people are drawn much more to the ritual than philosophy. Some prefer the philosophy to the ritual. In Taoism, the Tao is the underlying First Principle of the universe, source and determiner of everything, a force flowing through all life. There is no notion of a personal Ultimate or notion of a sovereign creator of the universe. The Tao is not worshipped, but is acknowledged and respected in the effort to become one with it. Taoism emphasizes themes such as naturalness, spontaneity, simplicity, detachment from desires, and most importantly, wu-wei (actionless action). Naturalness is regarded as a central value in Taoism. It describes the primordial state of things as well as a basic character of the Tao. It is associated with spontaneity and creativity and involves the freeing of oneself from selfishness and desire while appreciating simplicity. Wu-wei is the philosophy that the universe works harmoniously according to its own ways. When someone exerts their will against the world, they disrupt harmony. Taoism asserts that one must place their will in harmony with the natural universe in order to avoid harmful interference and achieve their goals effortlessly. sacred t exts The Tao Te Ching, or Daodejing, is widely regarded to be the most influential Taoist text. sacred Buildings/ structuresMany large and famous Taoist temple complexes exist in China.

Each generation pays respect: the spouse and son honor the deceased with bowing and incense; the daughters and grandchildren do the same. The coffin is then closed and placed in the hearse. The eldest son rides with the coffin, and will hold a large incense stick out the window. In case the spirit of the deceased gets lost, the incense will guide him. A family member calls the name of the deceased every five minutes to remind the deceased person's spirit to keep up with the hearse. Burial should take place in a gravesite chosen by a Taoist master making use of burial feng shui, burial geomancy. The gravesite is circled three times, then the coffin is put to rest. Burial completed, the family sits down to a picnic right at the gravesite. The meal may include some of the favorite foods of the deceased. An expected period of mourning is observed usually lasting a month. At some point after the fact, the family may arrange for an elaborate Taoist temple funeral, performed by a celibate monastic priest. A family may hire a Taoist priest to perform a very elaborate, multiple-stage (and sometimes, multiple-day) funeral ceremony through which various deities are given offerings, are told of the good deeds of the deceased, and are petitioned to forgive any debt incurred by wrongdoings. Paper effigies of the deceased and whatever he or she will need in the afterworld are burned; and a smooth transition of the deceased loved one to the heavenly realm is assured. death: Body Preparation Traditionally, Taoists do not believe in embalming or cremation. dietary laws and customs Some Taoists may be vegetarian; many are not. The Taoist notion of Yin-Yang (complementarity of opposites) informs traditional Chinese preferences for food combinations (e.g. sweet with sour). health (medical care) Taoists may prefer Chinese medicine to conventional Western options. tAoism120 Religious liteRacy PRimeR \u00a9 NDIN 2014 v .1health (mental health) Taoists may be open to conventional Western options, but may also see their practice of Qi-Gong or Tai Chi as a method for improving mental health. Pregnancy and Birth Nothing in Taoist ethical codes explicitly forbids abortion although it is not encouraged. Chinese religions including Taoism emphasize the importance of balance and harmony \u2014 in the individual, in the family, and in society generally. Having too many children can upset this balance, so sensible planning has been a valued part of human sexuality in Taoism and Confucianism.

Branches & denominations American Zoroastrians divide into camps (if not actual denominations) along various lines. Orthodox and Progressive, or Reform wings: Progressives are willing to accept converts, assert that only the Gathas are to be considered scripture, and have a relatively less complicated cosmology; the Orthodox hold that one must be born of two Zoroastrian parents in order to be counted as a member of the religion, accept a later collection of texts as scripture (in addition to the Gathas), and embrace a more complex cosmology. Those whose families come to the U.S. directly from Iran have customs, which differ somewhat from those who have come to the US from India (and are often called Parsis). Iranian and Indian Zoroastrian calendars have been out of sync with each other for centuries. A calendar reform, which restored holidays to their proper agricultural seasons, was accepted a few years ago by some American Zoroastrians. As a consequence one temple congregation can include use of three conflicting religious calendars. Basic t enets Zoroastrians believe that there is one universal and transcendent God, Ahura Mazda. He is said to be the one uncreated Creator to whom all worship is ultimately directed. The religion stresses the practice of \"Good Thoughts, Good Words, Good Deeds.\" Humans bear responsibility for all situations they are in, and in the way they act toward one another. Reward, punishment, happiness, and grief all depend on how individuals live their lives. sacred t exts The Avesta is the religious book of Zoroastrians that contains a collection of sacred texts. The compilation of these ancient texts was successfully established underneath the Mazdean priesthood and the Sassanian emperors. Only a fraction of the texts survive today. The texts that remain today are the Gathas, Yasna, Visperad and the Vendidad. Along with these texts is the communal household prayer book called the Khordeh Avesta, which contains the Yashts and the Siroza. The rest of the materials from the Avesta are called \"Avestan fragments\".Faravahar 122 Religious liteRacy PRimeR \u00a9 NDIN 2014 v .1sacred Buildings/ structures A Zoroastrian place of worship is called a Darbe Mehr (house of prayer). Ancient fire temples still being tended in India and Iran are important to this religion. Attempts are being made by some groups to establish an authentic fire temple in the US. Zoroastrians are also known for their Towers of Silence\u2014special structures on which to place a corpse (rather than to cremate or to bury in the ground). Consideration has been given to constructing Towers of Silence in North America. governance (Judicatory) A governing council in Mumbai issues edicts on matters of Zoroastrian faith and practice. In the U.S., the Orthodox pay great heed\u2014the Progressives, far less so. FEZANA (Federation of Zoroastrian Associations in North America) is an umbrella group seeking to unite and assist Zoroastrian congregations in the U.S. and Canada. governance (congregation) Local congregations are independent and self-governing\u2014usually by a board of directors. Point of contact Local: Adherents worship alone or at home with family Regional: N/A National: FEZANA (Federation of Zoroastrian Associations in North America) religious leaders A Zoroastrian priest is called a mobed. The Zoroastrian priesthood is hereditary, all-male, and has a ritual function only. Boys can be ordained at a young age. In addition to priests, community leaders include Zoroastrian scholars, activists, and congregation officers. religious objects/symbols A stylized portrait of Zarathustra is often hung in a Zoroastrian home or congregational meeting place. Faravahar or Fravaharan is an ancient figure resembling a bearded man astride wide-spread wings; with an unbroken ring as his \"saddle,\" and (extending below that) tail-feathers and two long threads\u2014each with a curl at the end. Some say that, in the ancient Avestan language, the literal meaning of this figure's name is forward-pulling force; others say it comes from the verb to choose. Some say it signifies the Fravashi\u2014the guardian spirit Ahura Mazda provides for each person. Others see it as a teaching tool by which each and every element of the figure is a reminder of an element of Zoroastrian teaching\u2014particularly, the role played by Good Thoughts, Good Words, and Good Deeds in the soul's journey toward union with Ahura Mazda. The Urn of Fire is another apt symbol for Zoroastrianism, since fire is considered the \"Son of God.\" Daily prayer and jashan (the elaborate ritual of prayer and offering) must be performed in the presence of fire. Facilitating Practices Zoroastrians will appreciate time and a place to perform their daily prayers (which require the kindling of a small fire in an urn). culture & social interaction No particular concerns. Zoro AstriAnism\u00a9 NDIN 2014 v .1 v.1 \u00a9 NDIN 2014 Religious liteRacy PRimeR 123gender roles/interaction Women and men have the same daily prayer obligation, and the same obligation to live of life of \"good thoughts, good words, good deeds.\" Women cannot be priests (a ritual-performance role), but the religion otherwise encourages equality among genders. Principal Weekly observance(s)In the U.S., Zoroastrian congregations meet weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly (as they are able) for fellowship, instruction, and congregational participation in rituals, particularly a Jashan (formal prayer rite with fire) officiated by a mobed (priest). daily religious Practices According to ancient tradition, Zoroastrians (women as well as men) are to pray five times daily (sunrise, noon, sunset, midnight, dawn) standing, and in the presence of \"clean\" fire (the symbol of righteousness). Ablutions are to be performed in preparation for prayer. The prayers themselves use texts from the Zoroastrian scriptures in Avestan and Pahlavi\u2014two ancient Persian languages. While praying, one unties and ties one's kushti\u2014the sacred knotted cord that ought to be worn as a belt over a sacred shirt (sudreh) at all times by initiated Zoroastrians. There is symbolism attached to the number of threads in the cord, and the number of knots. Minor differences have developed over the centuries between the Iranian and Parsi customs for performing the rite, which includes many supplications and concludes with the Fravarane: the Declaration of Faith. holy days/Festivals JamshediNoruz (Fasli): New Year's Day according to the Fasli Iran. Khordad (Shenshai). prayer rite with fire) officiated by a mobed (priest) can be performed for many celebratory occasions or a memorial. The flames rise and ebb as the priest chants, fans, and adds more fuel. The prayer texts vary, depending on the occasion, and the ritual can take an hour. All of the elements of creation are represented on the platform where the priest, dressed in white, and wearing a mask so as not to pollute the fire, sits to perform his task.\" Navjote is the rite of initiation by which one declares that he or she is a Zoroastrian, demonstrates ability to recite the daily prayers while tying a kushti, and receives a sudreh. dress (religious restrictions)As part of their inner garments, observant, initiated Zoroastrian children and adults wear a cotton vest made called a sudreh, with a small front pocket into which one is to put one's good thoughts, words, and deeds. They also tie a cord called a kushti around the waist. Many Zoroastrians wear western-style clothing, unless they are participating in a traditional ceremony.Zoro AstriAnism124 Religious liteRacy PRimeR \u00a9 NDIN 2014 v .1death: dying Practices When death approaches, Zoroastrian prayers become very important to the believer. A family member may wish to read from the Gathas. death: culture/Practices When death occurs in a Zoroastrian family, the hope is that someone will take note of the exact time. This information will be important later on, since there will be anniversaries to mark it. In a traditional Zoroastrian home, no food will be cooked during the interval between the death of family member and the disposal of the body, and the bereaved will abstain from meat. Friends and relatives will make sure meals are brought in. Zoroastrian priests will perform the prayers over the deceased, which can last for about an hour. Prayers over the body cannot take place in a Darbe Mehr, as that would deconsecrate the space. Several services are held when a Zoroastrian dies. For many of them the body is not present. For the first four days, there are specific prayers to help the soul of the deceased with the different stages through which it is passing, and those rituals may be held at the Darbe Mehr. The funeral prayer takes at least an hour, and consists of the first Gatha, the longest of the prayers of Zarathustra. Traditionally, Zoroastrian prayer is performed in front of an urn of fire. It is unlikely that a funeral home will allow this, so a candle may be substituted. death: Body Preparation Prayers are recited, the body is washed, and then the sudreh and kusthi\u2014the traditional undergarment and waist-cord\u2014are put back on the person. Zoroastrians don't embalm, as embalming would introduce something artificial into the person that had just been cleansed; and there is no viewing (thus no reason to embalm for a nicer appearance). In India, many Zoroastrians still transport the body of a deceased family member to a traditional dakhma, a Tower of Silence, where the flesh is consumed by birds of prey and the wear and tear of the elements. Because this is not an option in North America at this time, families may choose burial or cremation. Many Zoroastrians opt for cremation (even though fire is considered holy). Zoro AstriAnism\u00a9 NDIN 2014 v .1 v.1 \u00a9 NDIN 2014 Religious liteRacy PRimeR 125dietary laws and customs Zoroastrians have no mandated dietary requirements. However, some do set dietary boundaries for themselves on philosophical grounds, based on the religion's core doctrine: Vohu Mana (good mind; of Vohu Mana necessitates kindness toward animals (thus precludes slaughtering them for food). Therefore, to maintain a vegetarian diet is to do a \"good deed\" (another core Zoroastrian principle) and meat-eating is not. Some Zoroastrians maintain a vegetarian diet for four days each month, and during the entire eleventh month of the Zoroastrian calendar. They do this in honor of Vohu Mana (here understood as a divine being much like an archangel\u2014as well as \"good mind,\" intelligence, or wisdom). There are also traditional dietary guidelines to be followed when someone has died. For the three days of mourning, the family and very close friends abstain from meat, and limit themselves to fish and vegetables. Traditionally, there will be no cooking in the deceased person's home during this period. Food is prepared by relatives or friends and delivered to the deceased's immediate family. health (medical care) Many Zoroastrians are prone to Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase deficiency, a common human enzyme deficiency. Generally, Zoroastrians are open to the full range of conventional and state-of- the-art medical treatment. health (mental health) Generally, Zoroastrians are open to the full range of conventional mental healthcare options. Pregnancy and Birth Most Zoroastrians oppose abortion but believe it is an individual choice with individual consequences. Pregnant women in the Persian Zoroastrian community are encouraged to eat a special diet balanced between hot and cold. In the Parsi community there are special rituals at the fifth and seventh month of pregnancy. When a child is born in a hospital some Zoroastrians will request that a div (lamp) be kept alight in the confinement room for three days or so. For service Providers Physical contact No religiously mandated restrictions. dietary restrictions Some Zoroastrians choose vegetarianism.

Though Buddhist monastics will not necessar ily expect staff to be knowledgeable of their customs, a recognition of and an attempt to observe certain practices will be appreciated by them as well as lay Buddhists. A greeting common to all Buddhist traditions is to put the palms together in anjali (the gesture of prayer) and bow the head. Most Buddhists do welcome handshakes with an embrace, but preferably between same sexes. Staff and other guests should understand that this is more customary than religious. Special Note: Buddhist monks and nuns should typically not be touched by laypersons. Especially in the Theravada tradition of the Southeast Asian countries of Burma, Cambodia, Thailand, and Laos, they should also never touch others. In all Buddhist traditions, an acceptable form of a ddress when speaking to a monk or nun is \"Venerable .\" For lay Buddhists, there are no specific religious restrictions regarding sleeping or arrangements. However, for monastics, monks should have sleeping quarters separately from nuns and other women. Nuns should be sheltered separately from monks and men. In addition, a monk should never be alone with a woman (lay or monastic) and a nun should never be alone with a man (lay or monastic). Generally speaking, a gender segregated sleeping space, divided into samegender areas by a curtain or partition (acceptable), or separate rooms (preferable), is required. Shelter operators and residents should be made aware that observant Buddhists are encouraged to pray or meditate daily\u2014upon rising and before going to bed. Particularly at a time of disaster or crisis, prayer is important to all people of faith. Although Buddhist contemplative practice, chanting, and other forms of prayer and veneration can be offered at any place and time, a designated space (shrine) is preferable. A Buddhist shrine will typically include an image of the Shakyamuni Buddha (the image of the historical Buddha, Siddhrtha Gautama). Shrines may also include flowers, candles, incense, and bowls for offering water, food, or other items that may be distributed and consumed later. Images or icons of other important Buddhist figures may be included/substituted depending on the specific tradition or traditions of the local Buddhist community. Images and items may be displayed for rituals and respectfully stored for later use. Generally speaking, Buddhist practitioners will be comfortable sharing such a space with religious others without requiring much in the way of specific items. Buddhists are usually comfortable meditating in chairs, though meditation cushions (or blankets) are best. (In sitting meditation, if the knees are above the waist, sitting for extended periods becomes uncomfortable.) Cushions or blankets would also be helpful for kneeling while chanting. In addition, a clear space for full body prostrations might be appreciated. In keeping with disaster chaplaincy best practices, a Mass Care chapel or prayer room should be established as a multi faith space, without images or statues of any specific faith tradition. The area should be a quiet designated space with removable chairs, a plain table, and perhaps candle s. aPPenDiX a: Disaster tip s heets for faith Community P artners128 R ELIGI o U s L I t ER acy P RIMER \u00a9 NDIN 2014 v.1 \u00a9 All Rights Reserved v.1212 National Disaster Interfaiths Network 4 West 43rd Street Suite 407, New York, NY 10036 www.ndin.org info@ndin.org 212.669.6100 Despite assumptions, there are no set dietary laws in Buddhism. Buddhist dietary restrictions are structured very differently than those of the Abrahamic (Christian, Jewish and Muslim) religions. There is no such clear distinction between permitted and forbidden foods in Buddhism. Therefore, there is a great deal of div ersity in traditional Buddhist practice. It is always best for Mass Care providers to ask a local Buddhist community about their dietary needs, rather than to assume they are vegetarians or that they will eat meat. However, traditionally, many Bu ddhists are vegetarians. Vegetarian diet is often interpreted as \"do not harm,\" and many Buddhists choose to be vegetarian as a result of this precept. However, a basic tenet of Buddhism is that of reincarnation and the belief that animals can be reincarnated as humans and vice versa. As a result, most Buddhists do not kill animals, and many do not eat meat or fish because this is considered to be bad for their karma. Buddhism gives utmost importance to ahimsa (nonviolence), so there is a relationship between this concept and vegetarian practice in Buddhism. Buddhist monastics thrive on donations and offerings from their local communities. For Theravada monastics, going on \"almsrounds\" to receive the generous offerings ( dna ) of the local community, even in a Mass Care setting this is an important practical and symbolic gesture. When offering food to monastics it is customary to present it with your hands on the table, saying something like, \"Please accept this offering of food.\" Vietnamese, Chinese, and Taiwanese monks and nuns are strict vegetarians, though others may not be. Practically speaking, Mass Care staff may find it helpful to leave food for monastics with lay Buddhists to disperse. This is a meritorious action for practicing Buddhists. There are many Buddhist holy days held throughout the year. Many celebrate the birthdays of Bodhisattvas (deities) or other significant dates in the Buddhist calendar. The most significant celebration happens every May on the night of the full moon: Buddha Day, a celebration of the birth, enlightenment and death of the historical Buddha over 2,500 years ago. When possible, some Buddhists may be more comfortable seeking and/or receiving assistance from samegender service providers. Some may have difficulties in communicating openly or forthrightly with those of the opposite gender. Special Note: Given the restrictions regarding monastics' being alone with persons of the opposite gender, Buddhist monks and nuns will only seek and/or receiving assistance from samegender service providers. In addition, their medical treatment rooms and bed wards should be gender segregated by curtain or partition (acceptable), or separate rooms (preferable). Buddhist dress is usually a combination of culture and ethnicity, not religious requirement. Lay Buddhists usually do not wear distinctive clothing or haircuts, but sometimes may have stoles, pins, or vestments to denote lay leadership responsibilities within their respective communities. Typically, Buddhists conform to the clothing styles of the country where they live. However, recent immigrants, as well as B uddhist monks and nuns, may wear ethnic clothes or robes, respectively. Buddhist dress does not indicate a person's level of education or reflect on a particular conservative (or liberal) religious or political orientation. Buddhist monks and nuns usually wear distinctive robes or clothing, which will look different depending on region and tradition. In addition, in certain traditions, their heads are shaved. Buddhism is one of the five major world religions, with at least 500 million adherents worldwide. There are 3-4 million Buddhists in the United States (twothirds of whom are Asian American). Adherents follow the teachings of Siddhrtha Gautama, the historical Buddha (\"Awakened One\") who lived in India around the fifth century BCE. He taught four \"noble truths\": (1) the truth that life is suffering/anxiety/dissatisfaction/stress; (2) the truth of its cause; (3) the truth of its cessation; and (4) the truth of the path toward its cessation. Typically, three schools of Buddhism are spoken of: the Theravada of South and Southeast Asia, the Mahayana of East Asia, and the Vajrayana of Central Asia\u2014each having man y traditions, variations, and communities). In the Theravada trad ition, the Pali texts are canonical; in the Mahayan a, the Sanskrit Buddhist sutras and commentarial literature and Chinese gamas ; and in Vajrayana Buddhism, the Kanjur and Tanjur , as well as vast commentarial literature in the Tibetan language. The religion is called Buddhism in English, and adherents are Buddhists. This Tip Sheet was written in collaboration with: Rev.
