The result has been to increase the number of patient visits whiledramatically reducing the waitingtime for patients to be examined ortested. \"Overcrowding in Emergency Departments has become a seriousnational and local issue,\" saysEleanor Gates, RN, MSN, hospitalVice President for Neurosurgery and Trauma. \"At some hospitals, people wait as long as four hours.Unfortunately, when this happens,those people may walk out without being evaluated or treated. We wantto lessen the chances of thathappening at Jefferson.\" Coinciding with the introduction of a new telemetry admission unitwith eight monitored beds on 13Thompson in July, the number ofdaily patient visits to the ED is upsignificantly from the normalaverage of 160, Ms. Gates says. \"Reducing ED waiting time allows us to see and evaluate morepatients,\" Ms. Gates explains. The effect is expected to be even more dramatic in November when anew Medical/Surgery unit with 13regular beds for ED patients openson 13 Thompson. Hospital administrators believe that its opening will complete thenew \"Express\" method ofredesigning patient flow to improvepatient care, traffic and satisfaction. \"Our goal is to totally eliminate what the City Fire and Rescue unitscall 'diversions,'\" says Ms. Gates.\"Diversions,\" she explains, occurwhen Fire and Rescue \"divert\" newED cases to other hospitals becauseJefferson's ED is too full.

Thomas Jefferson University Hospital isintroducing a new conceptthat will give nursesincreased flexibility. Astaffing pool which youcan apply for immediatelywill begin operationNovember 1. The pool is using a multi-tiered paymentapproach so that nurseswilling to commitadditional hours in thearea of greatest need will benefit from higher rates of pay. The pool was created as a result of the feedback from nursing Focus Groups conducted last year and further articulated by themultidisciplinary Rapid Design Teams. Schedules are designed to fit into busy lifestyles, not fixed or structured, and can accommodate personal changes with flexibilityand choices. The program is another initiative by the hospital to help relieve nurse staffing issues.

Don Walker Photography3JeffNEWS October 1, 2002 Al Worthington Transforming Hospital's Medical Records To Visionary Health Information Management Employee Walking Marathon to End StrokeAn Impressive First: Two JMC Students Win AOA National Student AwardsSpend 30 minutes talking with Al Worthington, Director of thehospital's newly renamed HealthInformation ManagementDepartment, and one word comesto mind - enthusiasm. It takes a certain combination of experience and enthusiasm to see andguide the former Medical RecordDepartment in its transition from apaper-based repository of records tothe paperless, efficient electronicsystem Mr. Worthington envisions. And it's a vision Mr. Worthington enthusiastically brings to Jefferson.It's born from a long and versatilemanagement career that took himliterally around the world, giving him broad exposure to the very latestinformation management techniques. The difference between a Medical Record Department and a HealthInformation Management (HIM)Department is one of \"emphasis,\"says Mr. Worthington. \"A Medical Record Department's focus is on raising the standards ofclinical records. An HIM Depart-ment improves the quality of healthcare by insuring that the bestinformation is available to makeany healthcare decision. This can beexpanded to include the bestinformation available at the point ofcare, thereby explaining our interestin moving forward to an electronicmedical record.\" Points of a Vision In \"moving forward,\" Mr. Worthington envisions the following: Moving from a more passive paper repository of records to actively managinginformation, aided by the efficiency andversatility of electronic capability, with asingle point of access for patientinformation - for ambulatory care,inpatient care, emergency care. Speeding up the reimbursement process. Preparing for a new emphasis on confidentiality of patient information asit pertains to HIPAA Setting the stage for the job environment of the future. To arrive at this point in his career, Mr. Worthington gainedvaluable experience at criticalpoints in health care's evolutionover the past 25 years. Key Career Shift Describing his background as a \"real blend,\" he calls a career shiftin 1984 from the provider side ofhealth care to a blue chipinformation management companyas being key to his developingexpertise on DRGs and assignmentsin Europe and other nationsinvolving prospective payments. Now, he welcomes the chance to join an \"outstanding\" Jeffersonhealthcare team, which includes hiswife, Patricia H. Worthington, RN,MSN, a nutritional support nursewith Nursing Service since 1976.

Worthington For the first time, two Jefferson Medical College (JMC) students havereceived AOA National StudentAwards, one for original scientific research and another for anoutstanding scholarly paper. \"To our knowledge, having two winners from Jefferson in the sameyear has never happened before,\"says Troy L. Thompson II, MD,Professor of Psychiatry and HumanBehavior, JMC, and faculty advisor tothe Jefferson chapter of AOA, theNational Medical Honor Society. \"Having one winner is quite prestigious for a school, buthonoring two in the same year isunprecedented. This accomp-lishment highlights both the specificachievements of our two winnersand the overall quality of ourstudents,\" Dr. Thompson adds. Winner of a 2002 AOA National Student Research Fellowship isJoseph Capriotti, JMC '03, for his design of a study to monitor theusefulness of specific serummarkers to diagnose and monitortreatment response for acute vaso-occlusive crises in sickle cellanemia. He will conduct the study with Patrick Chang, MD, Instructor,Department of Medicine, JMC, andDavid Marmor, JMC '03, who haveboth been crucial in developing themethodology for the project.

Thompson II, MD, Joseph Capriotti, JMC '03 Researchers Link Gene to Alcoholic's Vulnerability to Heart Failure Some alcoholics can drink mostly what they want and their heartsstay perfectly fine. For others,chronic alcoholism can havedevastating effects, including a formof heart failure known ascardiomyopathy. Now, researchers at Jefferson Medical College and Hospital Clinicin Barcelona have pinpointed whatthey think may help explain suchdisparities. They have found that alcoholics who carry a certain form of aparticular enzyme are more likely than other alcoholics who don'thave the form to develop heartfailure, even when both groupshave drunk the same amount ofalcohol over a lifetime. \"It's the first real demonstration of genetic vulnerability to alcohol-induced tissue damage in theheart,\" says Emanuel Rubin, MD,Professor and Chair of Pathology,Anatomy and Cell Biology, JeffersonMedical College. The findings open up thepossibility for uncovering other such genetic predispositions for anumber of alcohol-related diseases.\"Chronic alcoholism is associatedwith diseases of many organs, suchas the liver and the brain - not justthe heart,\" he notes. Dr. Rubin and his colleagues at the University of Barcelonareported their findings September 3in the Annals of Internal Medicine .
