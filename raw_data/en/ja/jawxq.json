Complete all required items, and we strongly advise you complete the recommended items. You must complete the Health Clearance through the Tang Center. You may complete the health clearance at Tang whether you have SHIP or private insurance. UCEAP will forward your Health Clearance to CIEE after receiving it from you. Disregard instructions from CIEE to complete their medical form. |Click | - Republic of South Africa Medical Certificate - Students will need to submit a Republic of South Africa Medical Certificate ( [B1-811](http://www.southafrica-newyork.net/homeaffairs/forms/medical.pdf)) in order to obtain a student visa. A doctor or medical practitioner must complete this form. Coordinate the completion of this form with the UCEAP Health Clearance. Do not mail the B1-811 form to UCEAP. Include this form with your visa application. This form must not be older than 6 months at the time of visa application at the Los Angeles Consulate. - Radiological Report or Tuberculosis Skin Test - Students will need to submit a Radiological Report ( [B1-806](http://www.southafrica-newyork.net/consulate/forms/bi806.pdf)) in order to obtain a student visa. A doctor or medical practitioner must complete this form. Coordinate the completion of this form with the UCEAP Health Clearance. Do not mail the B1-806 form to UCEAP. Include this form with your visa application. This form must not be older than 6 months at the time of visa application at the Los Angeles Consulate. NOTE: [A skin test for TB](http://studyabroad.berkeley.edu/uceap/health/tb)will suffice for completion of the Radiological Report (x-ray not required). - Yellow Fever Vaccination - Students will need to submit a Yellow Fever vaccination card in order to obtain a student visa if arriving from or transiting through infected areas. This vaccination is to be noted on an International Certificate of Vaccination (ICV). The ICV should be affixed to the visa inside the student passport and presented at the point of entry. The YF vaccine is not necessary as a protective measure for residence in this country, so it is only considered required if you are arriving from or transitioning through infected areas. For areas with risk of yellow fever transmission, please review the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website.](https://www.cdc.gov/yellowfever/maps/index.html) - Because of the limited availability of this vaccine, if you determine that you need to get it at the Tang Center, then you must also complete the [Individual Travel Clinic Consultation](https://uhs.berkeley.edu/medical/international-travel-clinic)at the Tang Center. Travel Clinic appointments fill up quickly and we recommend students schedule their appointments well in advance. - Global Summer Internship Program - Required by CIEE: COVID-19 full vaccination - - The CIEE Physician's Medical Report is not required for students studying in CIEE programs through UCEAP. - HIV/AIDS - HIV/AIDS is estimated to be present in 18% of the adult population putting this country in the top tier of all countries (Source: Travax). South Africa has the largest antiretroviral therapy program in the world, but also has the world's largest epidemic, so access to treatment is limited. - Sun Safety - Sun block is recommended throughout the year, even during the winter months. In summer, a hat and sunglasses are strongly recommended. - TB Skin Test - A [Tuberculosis skin test](http://studyabroad.berkeley.edu/uceap/health/tb)is strongly recommended before travel if a student has not had one within two years. - Seasonal Flu - Influenza is one of the most common ailments for UCEAP students. Students are frequently in crowded places and regularly take crowded public transportation. The UCEAP Physician Consultant recommends flu vaccination for all students and strongly recommends it for those who will be abroad during the fall or winter with any chronic medical condition. - Bacterial Meningitis - Students planning to live in dormitories should be vaccinated against Meningococcal disease. - Measles - Measles remains a common disease in many parts of the world, including Europe, the Middle East, Asia, the Pacific, and Africa. Students who have not been vaccinated are at risk of getting the disease and spreading it to others. - Allergies - UCEAP advises students with certain medical conditions to wear a medical alert ID bracelet or pendant at all times while abroad. Such conditions may include diabetes, asthma, serious (anaphylactic) allergies, or any condition that could have severe consequences if they are unable to communicate during a health emergency. - Prescription Medications - Although medications in amounts clearly related to personal use for the expected duration of a trip (30 days) are rarely inspected or questioned, local Customs officials can be suspicious of medications, particularly if students are traveling with large amounts. In some countries, drugs that are legal and readily available in the US are considered illegal, require a prescription, or arouse the suspicions of local officials or customs and immigration authorities. - - Prescribed medication regimens are important to student's health and well-being. Students should never abruptly discontinue their medication, especially abroad. - - UCEAP cannot maintain a list of prescribed (or over-the-counter) medications and their legality in the different countries. It is the student's responsibility to get this information before departure. - - Students must: - - Keep medicines in their original, labeled, pharmacy packaging when possible. The label should include the student's name. - - Obtain and carry a letter from the prescribing physician on letterhead, appropriately signed and dated, stating diagnosis, treatment, and medication regimen, including the generic name. - - Review medication regulations on the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) website and official government sites if they take medications containing controlled substances (including amphetamine-based medications). Excerpted national statutes for most countries can be found on [the INCB website](http://www.incb.org/incb/en/travellers/country-regulations.html). - - Students with diabetes and those who use injectable medications should obtain and carry at all times a doctor's letter explaining the need to carry needles and syringes. According to some students' reports, their US health practitioners have assumed that doctors abroad can prescribe the same medications commonly prescribed in the US. This is not always the case. Students should research whether their medications are legal and locally available in their program country. - Mailing Medications Abroad - Many countries have strict laws about mailing medications. Students, and their parents, have found out the hard way that their medications, including oral contraceptives and vitamins, are stopped by host country's customs officials. Additionally, the US Post Office restricts using the US postal system to mail medications. Prescription medications can only be mailed by Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) registered entities. Similar regulations may apply to over-the-counter medications. - - Do not mail any type of pharmaceuticals to other countries. - General Immunizations - If you are planning travel to areas outside your EAP program country which may have additional health requirements/immunizations, you may get these immunizations from the Tang Travel Clinic, or from your own doctor or health maintenance organization. Many common immunizations are given as a series of vaccinations that may take months to complete, so begin the process as early as possible. Planning ahead may also allow for a wider range of vaccine options and reduced cost to you. - Additional Immunizations - If you complete your health clearance with a private provider, but then find you need to get an immunization from the Tang Center which was not available from your private provider, you must complete [Individual Travel Clinic Consultation](https://uhs.berkeley.edu/medical/international-travel-clinic)at the Tang Center and we encourage you to do set up this appointment as soon as possible. This rule applies to the Japanese encephalitis and yellow fever vaccines and may apply to malaria prophylactics, typhoid vaccine and others. If you have SHIP Insurance, then SHIP covers: - - The cost of the Travel Consultation. - Immunizations that are part of the domestic series at 100%, such as influenza, HPV, Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria, and whooping Hepatitis and MMR (measles, mumps, rubella). - "}
