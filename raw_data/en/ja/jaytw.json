PUBLIC HEALTH DIVISION Immunization Program Live Vaccine Spacing and Tuberculin Testing (TST and Interferon Gamma Release Assays ( IGRAs) Last Reviewed 24 November 2022 Last Revised 24 November 2022 This order expires 30 November 2024 What' s new Addition of spacing considerations between live vaccines and IGRAs . Recommendations for use :1 A. Inactivated vaccines, including COVID -19 vaccines, can be given before, on the same day , or at any time after a TB test is done. B. Oral live vaccines can be given before, on the same day , or at any time after a TB skin test is done. C. Injectable live vaccines may be given simultaneously (same clinic day) with a TB test. However, if a live vaccine was administered 1 day or more ago, placing the TST or drawing the IGRA should wait for 4 weeks after the administration date of the live vaccine. If the TST was placed first, the live vaccine can be administered after the test is read with no wait ing per iod. D. TST or IGRA reactivity in the absence of active tuberculosis is not a contraindication to administration of any vaccine, including live, attenuated vaccines. E. If a patient is suspected of having active tuberculosis, MMR and MMRV should not be administered due to the theoretical risk that measles vaccine might exacerbate active tuberculosis.
