We will review the structure, function and diseases of the major organ systems of the human body, with an overview of disease prevention and laboratory simulation of case studies for every organ systems. The course is oriented to pre -medical and health professional related stude nts. Course Objectives Upon completion of this course, students should be able to: -Utilize the appropriate anatomical terminology when referring to the human body. - Recognize anatomy, physiology, and pathophysiology of the blood, heart and circulatory system, immune and lymph system, digestive system, respiratory system, and urinary systems, and deal with different case studies, and identify symptoms, required pre -tests, confirmatory tests, and pathological conditions for these systems, and expl ain the behavioral ways for disease prevention. -Integrate information from current clinical literature with basic anatomical concepts and how they relate to the normal or disease state. Course Structure Lectures Students are responsible for all topics and issues discussed in the lectures, even if they are not covered in the textbook. All lectures will be posted on blackboard at least one day before the lecture day. Keck School of Medicine of USC Master of Science in Global Medicine Program 2 Presentations assignments 20% One or two oral presentations of diseases will be assigned to each student at the beginning of the semester depending on the number of students. Students will discussions and symptoms; other diseases that produce the same symptoms, risk factors, and diagnostic based on pre and post confirmatory tests, prevention method and therapeutic plan for that particular disease. Students can use different resources (Internet, literature, videos, etc.) to do the assignment. Questions about each of the presentations will be inclu ded in the final exam. Homework Will account for 10% of the final semester grade. Each student is responsible for completion of his/her own assignment/s and submission by the assign due day and time. Late assignments will not be accepted. Midte rm exams and Final 2 in-class Midterms worth 40% (20% each), and a final exam worth 30% of your total grade. Midterms will have 50 questions, and the final exam will have 100 questions Required Readings and Supplementary Materials Textbook is required and can be download from the link below. Y ou are expected to come to class prepared to discuss the assigned reading for that day. During class, you are expected to be prepared to discuss important points from the readings, and to ask questions if there is something you do not understand from the readings or class discussions. Participation levels in class discussion are student - determined, but those expecting to excel in this course will take the time to both read and analyze the assigned reading m aterial.

Grading Students will be assessed based on Students with Disabilities Any student requesting academic accommodations based on a disability is required to register with Disability Services and Programs (DSP) each semester. A letter of verification for approved accommodations can b e obtained from DSP. Please be sure the letter is delivered to me (or to TA) as early in the semester as possible. DSP is located in STU 301 and is open 8:30 a.m. -5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday.

Statement on Academic Integrity USC seeks to maintain an optimal learning environment. General principles of academic honesty include the concept of respect for the intellectual property of others, the expectation that individual work will be submitted unless otherwise allowed by an instructor, and the obligations both to protect one's own academic work from misuse by others as well as to avoid using another's work as one's own. All students are expected to understand and abide by these principles. SCampus , the Student Guidebook, (www.usc.edu/scampus or http://scampus.usc.edu ) contains the University Student Conduct Code (see University Governance, Section 11.00), while the recommended sanctions are located in Appendix A. 4 Emergency Preparedness/Course Continuity in a Crisis In case of a declared emergency if travel to campus is not feasible, USC executive leadership will announce an electronic way for instructors to teach students in their residence halls or homes using a combination of Blackboard, teleconferencing, and other technologies.
