Vitamin D plays a vital role in our immune system, helping to regulate the activity of immune cells, which elicit antiviral responses. It helps to keep our immune systems balanced and can help fight off infection. The immune system is a complex network of cells, tissues, and organs that work together to identify and fight off harmful substances like viruses and bacteria. It's essential to ensure that your body's various systems function correctly to work together as efficiently as possible. That's where chiropractic care comes in. How Does Chiropractic Care Increase Immunity? Many people know about the importance of Vitamin D from the sun in improving immunity. Still, regular chiropractic care can also play an essential role in keeping our bodies healthy. Chiropractic care focuses on restoring and maintaining spinal health through chiropractic adjustments that address misalignments in the spine's vertebrae. Chiropractic adjustments align the vertebrae, releasing pressure on nerves that allow the body to function optimally. When the spine is in proper alignment, all the tissues in the body are working at their best, which helps to support the immune system. Maintenance chiropractic adjustments are beneficial because they keep your spine in proper alignment, balancing the nervous system and preventing strain and tension on your muscles, which can lead to injury or inflammation due to decreased immunity. Regular chiropractic care can increase white blood cell count, which helps support natural antiviral responses within our bodies, allowing us to fight off illnesses quickly if we come into contact with viruses or bacteria. Research has also shown that spinal manipulation can reduce stress hormones like cortisol, reducing inflammation throughout the body and thus increasing immunity against bacterial infections. Vitamin D and the Importance of Natural Sunlight Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that helps the body absorb and retain calcium and phosphorus; both are critical for building bone. It is also necessary for muscle and nerve functions and supports the immune system in fighting bacteria and viruses. Vitamin D deficiency is linked to increased autoimmunity and infection risk. Vitamin D deficiency has a causal relationship with Rickets and osteomalacia. It is also strongly linked with osteoporosis. Approximately 42% of the US population is Vitamin D deficient. People with darker skin have an even higher prevalence of Vitamin D deficiency. The best way to get your daily dose of Vitamin D is through exposure to sunlight. When exposed to ultraviolet B radiation from sunlight, our bodies produce Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol). Vitamin D is then converted into its active form, calcitriol, in the liver and kidneys. The time needed in the sun depends on skin type, age, season, geographic location, time of day, cloud cover, and air pollution levels. Suppose you cannot get enough sun exposure due to weather or other factors, such as living in a northern latitude with less sunlight during winter. In that case, you can supplement your Vitamin D intake in different ways, such as through food sources like fatty fish or fortified foods like organic milk, freshly squeezed orange juice, or supplements, which is covered later in this article. It is important to note that too much sun exposure can be dangerous, so it's best to find a balance between getting enough sun exposure for adequate Vitamin D production and avoiding overexposure which can lead to skin damage or skin cancer. In addition to aiding in immunity, research has shown that adequate Vitamin D levels may also reduce inflammation associated with chronic diseases such as heart disease and diabetes. It may also help protect against certain types of cancer by reducing cell growth and increasing cell death in cancerous cells. Overall, it is important to remember that adequate levels of Vitamin D are essential for optimal health and immunity throughout all seasons - not just during winter months when we are more likely to be exposed to colds and flu viruses - so make sure you're getting enough! It is essential not to forget about diet to improve immunity - adding foods rich in Vitamin D, like fatty fish or fortified milk products, will help ensure you get enough of this essential vitamin for optimal health throughout all seasons! These foods and adequate amounts of sunshine exposure (with protection!) are vital for maintaining good Vitamin D levels too! Many supplements out there have positive effects for those looking for even more ways to support their immune systems. Such as CoQ10, which is an antioxidant found in organ meats; probiotics help replenish beneficial colonies; zinc; magnesium and multivitamins all work together synergistically with chiropractic adjustments when it comes to boosting immunity!
