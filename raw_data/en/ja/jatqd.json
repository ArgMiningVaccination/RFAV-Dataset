Then, you need to slow down, focus within, and become aware of yourself. It takes extra effort to unplug from the frenetic energy of the world and listen to what your body is saying. Put in that extra effort through spiritual meditation and experience the magic that unfolds. What Is Spiritual Meditation? Spiritual meditation is an experience that takes you to the depths of who you are. You, as your real self, stripped of all the perceptions you had about yourself until that point in your life. In the process, you experience joy and peace. A feeling of love and light warms up your being. Spiritual meditation makes you realize the eternal truth and let go of all that had happened and will happen. The present is where you want to be and find solace in. The need to practice spiritual meditation comes from an innate longing to see and think beyond the chaotic world surrounding you. Now, let's learn how to do it.

Choose A Comfortable Position Before you begin the practice, the most important aspect is to find a place and position that you will be comfortable in. This involves staying away from the noises of the city as much as possible and surrounding yourself with greenery and the gentle chirping of birds. Spiritual meditation can quickly put you to sleep. To avoid that, you must be extra cautious of the position you wish to meditate in. Choose a position that you are comfortable in, but not something that is way too relaxing and will make you easily drift into sleep. Sit in the [Vajrasana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vajrasana_%28yoga%29), [Padmasana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotus_position), or the [Sukhasana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sukhasana). Or you can even sit on a chair with your back straight, or stand up with your back leaning on the wall. Whatever works. Then, close your eyes lightly. - 2. Experience The Process When you have a task to accomplish, what do you usually do? You plan, have the procedure in your head, and follow the pattern consciously. That is how we are used to doing tasks. We plan and execute them in a controlled manner. However, this is not the ideal way to deal with meditation. Here, you will have to let it go. Loosen up and let it take its course in a natural and organic manner. You should be a passive spectator, allowing the process to happen on its own. Do not bother about getting it right or be concerned about the outcome. Let it flow in its natural course. - 3. Acknowledge The Thoughts We live in a world that runs on information. You are always fed with new data in the form of live updates, breaking news, and social media. As a result, your mind is always abuzz with new content and your brain's reaction to it. It is a never-ending game as long as you are awake, and even during sleep, it is quite a task to calm your whirring mind. You invariably react to every thought and end up being affected by it. Even while you sit to meditate, thoughts will bombard you. But, the challenge lies in not responding to them and allowing them to control you. Let the ideas seep in like they usually do, but control the urge to react to them. Let them waft away, enabling you to get back to your meditation. - 4. Utter A Prayer As you sit there, preventing your thoughts from maligning your calm composure, choose a prayer in your head. A prayer need not necessarily be related to religion. You can utter anything that means something good for you or something that you like. It could be a word or a phrase. It could be something related to wildlife if you are a nature lover or something that makes you happy. It could even be a mantra. Now, keep your body loose and relaxed. Breathe naturally and slowly. Observe your breath as it goes in and out. Thoughts interrupt your process, but you know what to do with them. Get back to your body and breathing after every thought interruption. Then, at each exhalation, think of the prayer you chose. Utter it in your head every time you breathe out. Use the prayer as a means to bring back your attention to observing your breath. - 5. Reflect On Yourself Turn your attention to your body and your awareness and presence in the space. Become conscious of your surroundings. Observe how your body feels. Be attentive to your thoughts and breath. Relax completely and stay calm. Open your eyes slowly and sit in the same position for some time. Let the effects of meditation sink in. Feel it, and enjoy the lightness your body feels. Think about the entire process and how you went about it. Notice how you have become less agitated than before the meditation. Accept that your reaction to the process was natural. Finally, come out of the meditation zone, stretch a bit, and go about your day. "}
