Give time to stress management Have you ever gotten sick after a stressful time in your life? Stress is known to weaken the immune system if improperly managed. Getting plenty of sleep, exercising and eating a healthy, balanced diet are all known ways to cope with stress. However, in times of prolonged stress and disrupted routine, you may consider finding additional stress-relieving techniques that work for you. Whether it's mediation, yoga, music, writing, cooking, hobbies or simply taking a break from news and social media, having a way to de-stress is important for both your mental and physical health. 2. Focus on fruits and vegetables Try to incorporate five to seven servings of fruits and vegetables every day to ensure your body has enough vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. Be sure to include a variety of colors when choosing produce. We get different vitamins and minerals from red, blue, green, white and purple plants, etc. The main source of our vitamins and minerals should be from the foods we choose, not supplements. Don't get caught up thinking you need to take megadoses of vitamin supplements to stay healthy. 3. Get enough sleep We all know that being tired can cause stress, but lack of sleep can also weaken the immune system and inhibit the body's ability to fight off infection. Seven to nine hours of sleep is recommended each day for adults, and children need eight to 14 hours, depending on their age. Luckily, with much of the country working from home and social distancing, you may finally be able to find some extra time to rest. 4. Incorporate exercise Getting quality exercise doesn't have to mean going to the gym. Simply taking a walk outside or doing some stretches in your living room can give you important health benefits. Exercise works wonders on the mind and body, including improving our immune function. Physical activity helps burn calories, reduce stress and lowers your risk of chronic disease. 5. Avoid alcohol Heavy drinking can make you [more susceptible to getting sick](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4590612/), as alcohol is known to weaken the body's cells that help fight off infection. Try healthier options to pass the time at home, such as hobbies or exercise. 6. Practice good hygiene You've seen the message everywhere: wash your hands. To prevent the spread of germs, wash your hands for at least 20 seconds, with warm water if possible. Use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol in between washes. Keep your hands away from your face; germs can easily enter through our eyes, nose and mouth. Frequently disinfect heavily used surfaces, including phones, tables, counters and chairs. And of course, stay home if you are sick. Mental Health During COVID-19 With the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), this time may be stressful for many people. Because prolonged and unmanaged stress can weaken the immune system, it is important that, if you or someone in your family is experiencing additional stress and or anxiety due to the events of COVID-19, you consult a professional or work to manage your mental health at home.
