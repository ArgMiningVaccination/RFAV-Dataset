Yet more and more people feel alone and unhappy, leading lives that are void of meaning on deep and profound levels. Often this manifests as insomnia, depression, anxiety, addiction, phobias, eating disorders and more. It is human nature to seek an integrated state of balance, and mindfulness is key. We look for ways to improve our health, our morale, even our yoga poses. We dream of deeply satisfying relationships and connection with loved ones. We look for something outside of us, hoping for freedom from physical, mental and emotional pain. Yoga, hypnosis/hypnotherapy, health coaching & wellness are powerful ways alone or in combination as options for healing. Choices In large part many common ailments are affected by the lifestyle choices we make on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis. There is a direct relationship between these lifestyle choices and disease processes. Modern life creates an almost constant state of tension. All of this has an enormous impact on health and well-being. With the same 24 hours in each day, we as individuals must choose how we'll use the time we have. Ask yourself \"Is what I'm doing right now creating the best days for me?\" If the answer to that question is no, or even uncertainty, give yourself permission to feel good, to create happiness, wholeness, wellness. My approach to treatment is grounded in a holistic perspective. A key component of your individualized wellness plan examines stress-levels, nutrition, emotional balance, exercise, and personal spiritual beliefs. Simple changes can produce profound improvement in the quality of one's life. Use counseling, health- life-wellness coaching, hypnosis/hypnotherapy and yoga/mind-body psychotherapy to create the wellness and health you deserve. "}
