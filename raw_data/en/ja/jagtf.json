We have now examined whether these benefits would persist at 24 months. Methods: This was a phase 3, multicentre, open-label, randomized controlled trial at 10 centres in Canada and one in Australia. Patients were eligible if they had a hematological malignancy and were to receive an unrelated donor graft. They could receive myeloablative or non-myeloablative/ reduced intensity conditioning, Patients were randomized to receive, or not receive, ATG 4\u00c2\u00b75 mg/kg as part of conditioning. The primary endpoint was freedom from all systemic immunosuppressive therapy (IST) without resumption up to 24 months after transplantation. Findings: Thirty-eight (38\u00b73%) of 99 patients in the ATG group were free from IST at 24 months compared with 18 (18\u00b76%) of 97 patients in the No ATG group (adjusted OR 3\u00b749 [ 95 CI 1\u00b760 - 7\u00b760]; p = 0\u00b7002). Most patients retained the same IST status from 12 to 24 months, 74 (74\u00b77%) and 79 (81\u00b74%) in the ATG and No ATG and groups respectively. The cumulative incidence of relapse was 16 (16\u00b72%) of 99 patients in the ATG group compared with 17 (17\u00b75%) of 97 patients in the No ATG group (p=0\u00b773). The cumulative incidence of CGVHD at 24 months was 26 (26\u00b73%) of 99 patients in the ATG group compared with 40 (41\u00b72%) in the No ATG group (p=0\u00b7032). Symptoms of CGVHD were more prevalent in the No ATG, the scores by Lee scale being 13\u00b757 (SE 1\u00b747) and 19.90 (SE 2\u00b715) in the ATG and No ATG groups respectively; (p=0\u00b7017). The cumulative incidence of non-relapse mortality was 21 (21\u00b72%) of 99 patients in the ATG group compared with 30 (30\u00b79%) in the No ATG group (p=0\u00b714). Overall survival at 12 months was 74\u00b78% (SE 4\u00b74) compared with 64\u00c2\u00b79% (SE 4\u00b78) in the ATG and No ATG groups respectively (adjusted HR 0\u00b756 [95% CI [0\u00b735-0\u00c2\u00b790]; p=0\u00b7017)). At 24 months follow up of all patients, 70 (71%) patients out of 99 in the ATG group and 52 (53.6%) out of 97 in the No ATG group were alive (p=0\u00b7018). Both acute and chronic graft versus host disease- and relapse free-survivals (GRFS and CRFS) were significantly higher in the ATG group (p=0\u00b70034 and p=0\u00b701 respectively). Depressive symptoms were more prominent in the No ATG group, the mean CES-D scores being 10\u00c2\u00b739 (SE 1\u00b729) in the ATG group compared with 14\u00b763 1\u00c2\u00b748) the No ATG group (p=0\u00b7034). Interpretation: Pretreatment with ATG provides long term benefits consisting of decreases in CGVHD and its symptoms, depressive symptoms, use of IST and improvement in survival. This trial is the first to demonstrate both a survival advantage and a decrease in depressive symptoms for patients receiving ATG. ATG should be included in the preparative regimens of all transplants that use unrelated donors.
