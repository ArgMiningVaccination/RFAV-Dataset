Your mental state does not have to be the same. It sounds counterintuitive, but the very device that delivers anxiety-inducing news could be the thing that also brings you some calm. Meditation apps are a welcome window into a world of gentle bells, chirping birds, and encouraging words. Beyond the peaceful imagery, the ceasing of the mind's worry with meditation can have a tremendous impact on health, [easing anxiety, depression, and pain](https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/use-mindfulness-to-cope-with-chronic-pain) and even [strengthening immunity](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/how-mindfulness-training-can-help-you-achieve-immunologic-health/). Apps make meditation incredibly accessible. They remove the challenges of finding a class that fits into your schedule and the travel time it would take to attend. And they are available wherever you encounter a stressful situation or find yourself with a free moment. They've been proven effective in many studies: An [Arizona State University study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6614998/) found that students who used Calm had reduced stress and increased self-compassion that were comparable to the results of an in-person class. And researchers [recorded a positive effect on many aspects of mental well-being](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30294390/) from Headspace. While there are not many long-term studies involving large numbers of participants, the news is nevertheless positive and has yielded one important piece of advice: Sticking to a regular meditation practice with an app is the key to maximizing its wellness benefits. We're here to share with you a few of our favorite ways to get our om on. Prices listed are for premium versions of the apps; some offer free trials or free versions. Many offer in-app reminders that you can make use of, and if you choose one without those, we suggest setting up a daily alert on your phone.
