Your dog, like yourself and most pets, has yeasts, (candida), along with naturally occurring bacteria as a natural part of their body environment, both on the surface and internally. Normally, these yeasts and bacteria live harmoniously on your dog and do not cause problems, however, if something happens to upset the balance or your dog's natural flora, yeast can proliferate, referred to as candida overgrowth. Candida overgrowth causes infection characterized by itching, discharge, odor, and inflammation on the skin, or internal gastrointestinal symptoms. Treatment focuses on resolving symptoms and restoring natural balance to prevent yeast infestations. Natural remedies may take longer than conventional medications to address the condition, but have fewer side effects, and may resolve the situation on a more long-term basis. Yeast can become resistant to conventional treatments, thus necessitating an alternative solution to the problem such as natural remedies. Natural remedies can consist of herbs, enzymes, and vitamins administered to restore natural flora balance in your dog making it difficult for yeast infections to take hold and cause problems. Natural Candida Remedies Procedure in Dogs A holistic veterinarian can help recommend several strategies and appropriate natural remedies for candida infections, including: - Providing a proper diet is the first step to controlling candida overpopulation. Yeasts proliferate on a diet that includes carbohydrates and sugars, so cutting these items from your dog's diet is a critical first step. A meat-based diet, free from sugar, grains, and starch will be recommended. Commercially available natural dog foods are available that meet this criteria or appropriate home cooked or raw meat can be provided to your dog. This diet may also aid with inflammation and is appropriate for most dogs, who naturally thrive on a meat-based diet. If you are using honey to address inflammation it should be removed from the diet as it provides sustenance for candida organisms. Garlic and oregano can be added to the diet as these are antifungal in nature. - Coconut oil can also be added to your dog's diet at a dosage of 1 tsp per 10 pounds of body weight. Coconut oil contains fatty acids which destroy yeasts in the gut without upsetting natural flora balance. - Herbs and supplements such as, oregano oil, pau d'arco, rosemary, thyme, caprylic acid, and undecylenic acid can be added to your dog's diet, and have been shown to have antifungal properties and restore natural flora balance. - Natural immune boosters will help eliminate fungal overgrowth. Echinacea or oregon grape may be effective. - Probiotics allow \"good\" bacteria to establish in your dog's digestive system after the \"bad\" candida organisms have been eliminated. This process should take place 2 weeks after steps are taken to reduce harmful candida populations. - Detoxification by providing enzymes that help your dog's liver break down and eliminate dead candida cells should be performed as a final stage to this process. Eliminate dead yeast build up in specific areas of the body where infection has been rampant-- the ears is a prime example. Clean and disinfect the affected area during treatment and on an ongoing basis if necessary to help prevent reinfection. Dogs ears can be cleaned with either store bought solution or witch hazel and cotton balls; do not use Q-tips. Additionally, for candida infections of your dog's paws, a paw soak with 1 gallon water, 1 cup vinegar, and 1 cup hydrogen peroxide followed by a thorough drying of your dog's feet will help remove dead cells. Do not rinse after astringent soak but allow the residue to remain and act as an antifungal. - Natural antifungal shampoos and rinses are also available. Antifungal shampoos made from tea tree oil or an alternative blend help control yeast growth on your dog's body surface. An antifungal rinse solution of 1 gallon water, 1 cup vinegar, 1 cup lemon juice and 20 drops peppermint oil may also be effective, used regularly, 1 week after antifungal shampoos to prevent yeast overgrowth. Antifungal rinses should not be put on your dog's head or near their eyes. Do not rinse with water after antifungal rinses but towel dry your dog thoroughly. If yeast infections are chronic ,check with a veterinarian to see if another disease or condition is present that is disrupting your dog's immune system and requires treatment. Efficacy of Natural Candida Remedies in Dogs The effectiveness of natural candida remedies is in addressing the root cause of candida overpopulation. Traditional medications only treat the resulting overgrowth without making adjustments to your dog's overall system to prevent imbalance and yeast overgrowth. In addition, traditional veterinary preparations do not address the removal of dead yeast cells by cleaning, disinfecting and detoxification. Remaining dead yeast cells can contribute to recurrence of yeast infections. Because \"good\" bacteria and yeast can be killed with traditional medications, imbalance that allows \"bad\", organisms to proliferate can result. Natural remedies address the reintroduction of healthy bacteria and yeast to your dog's system. A combination of traditional and natural therapies for troublesome candida infections may be the most effective at providing short-term relief and preventing long-term recurrence of yeast overpopulation in your dog. Natural Candida Remedies Recovery in Dogs Natural candida treatments take time to be effective and may involve several repeated treatments over weeks or months. Sometimes the dog's symptoms may appear to worsen temporarily as large numbers of yeasts are killed off. Removal of these dead cells is an important part of recovery with natural candida treatments by detoxifying and cleaning your dog's system to remove toxic substances associated with candida \"die off\". This involves helping your dog's body to eliminate these toxins with natural preparations or dermal disinfectants and rinses. Cost of Natural Candida Remedies in Dogs Natural candida remedies are very cost effective, with some household products being useful. Commercially available preparations are also usually affordable and not as expensive as traditional medications. However, because different remedies may need to be used to determine what is effective for your dog and repeated applications may be required, costs can accumulate over time. Holistic veterinary consultation can range from $50 to $150 per session. Worried about the cost of treating your pet's symptoms? Pet Insurance covers the cost of many common pet health conditions.

Dog Natural Candida Remedies Considerations Natural candida remedies can take longer than traditional therapies for effects to be realized. However, natural remedies may provide more long-term relief and prevent recurrence by addressing the cause of natural flora imbalance. Natural preparations can have side effects and the advice of a holistic veterinarian on appropriate remedies for your dogs condition is recommended. Natural Candida Remedies Prevention in Dogs Ensuring your dog has a healthy diet, low in carbohydrates and high in protein, will help prevent imbalances resulting in candida growth. When your dog is experiencing illness requiring administration of medications such as antibiotics, they should be monitored to address overgrowth of yeast organisms at once if they occur. Natural candida remedies can in themselves be a preventative for the formation of candida infections and can be used on an ongoing basis. Antifungal rinses applied regularly, especially in the summer months, to dogs who like going in the water may be an effective way to inhibit candida growth in these dogs.
