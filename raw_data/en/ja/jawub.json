If a serious or opportunistic infection develops, discontinue CIBI NQO and control the infection. Reported infections from Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors used to treat inflammatory conditions: Active tuberculosis, which may present with pulmonary or extrapulmonary disease. Test for latent TB before and during therapy; treat latent TB prior to use. Monitor all patients for active TB during treatment, even patients with initial negative, latent TB test. Invasive fungal infections, including cryptococcosis and pneumocy stosis. Patients with invasive fungal infections may present with disseminated, rather than localized, disease. Bacterial, viral, including herpes zoster, an d other infections due to opportunistic pathogens . Avoid use of CIBINQO in patients with anactive, serious infection including localized infections . The risks and benefits of treatment with CIBINQO should be carefully considered prior to initiating therapy in patients with chronic or recurrent infection s. Patients should be closely monitored for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with CIBINQO , including t he possible development of tuberculosis in patients who tested negative for latent tuberculosis infection prior to initiating therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . Mortality In a large, randomized, postmarketing safety study in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients 50 years of age and older with at least one cardiovascular risk factor comparing another JAK inhibitor to TNF blocker treatment, a higher rate of all -cause mortality, including sudden cardiovascular death, was observed with the JAK inhibitor .CIBINQO is not approved for use in RA patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] . Malignancies Malignancies were reported in patients treated with CIBINQO. Lymphoma and other malignancies have been observed in patients receiving JAK inhibitors used to treat inflammatory conditions .In RA patients treated with another JAK inhibitor, a higher rate of malignancies (excluding non - melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) )was observed when compared with TNF blockers . Patients who are current or past sm okers are at additional increased risk [see Warnings and Precautions (5. 3)]. Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events Major adverse cardiovascular events were reported in patients treated with CIBINQO . In RA patients 50 years of age and older with at least one cardiovascular risk factor treated with another JAK inhibitor, a higher rate of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) (defined as cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and stroke ), was observed when compared with TNF blockers . Patients who are current or past smokers are at additional increased risk . Discontinue 4CIBINQO in patients that have experienced a myocardial infarction or stroke [see and pulmonary including PE , DVT, and arterial thrombosis have been reported in patients receiving JAK inhibitors used to treat inflammatory conditions. Many of these adverse reactio ns were serious and some resulted in death. In RA patients 50 years of age and older with at least one cardiovascular risk factor treated with another JAK inhibitor, a higher rate of thrombosis was observed when compared with TNF blockers. Avoid CIBINQO inpatients at risk. If symptoms of thrombosis occur, discontinue CIBINQO and treat appropriately [see Warnings and Precautions (5. 5)]. 1INDICATIONS AND USAGE CIBINQO is indicated for the treatment of adults with refractory ,moderate -to-severe atopic dermatitis whose disease is not adequately controlled with other s ystemic drug products, including biologics ,or when use of those therapies is inadvisable . Limitations of Use CIBINQO is not recommended for use in combination with other JAK inhibitors, b iologic immunomodulators, or with other immunosuppressants. 2DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 2.1 Recommended Testing, Evaluations, and Procedures Prior to Treatment Initiation Perform the following tests and evaluations prior to CIBINQO initiation: Tuberculosis (TB) infection evaluation -CIBINQO initiation is not recommended in patients with active TB.

Discontinue therap y if inadequate response is seen after dosage increase to 100 mg once dail y. 2.5Dosage Modifications due to Strong Inhibitors In pat ients taking strong inhibitors of cy tochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19 reduce the dosage to 50 mg once dail y [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3 )].If an adequate response is not achieved with CIBINQO 50 mg orall y daily after 12 weeks, consider increasing dosage to 100 mg orally once daily . Discontinue therap y if inadequate response is seen after dosage increase to 100 mg once dail y. 2.6Treatment Discontinuation due to Serious Infections or Hematolog ic Adverse Reactions Serious or Opportunistic Infections If a patient develops a serious or opportunistic infection, discontinue CIBINQO and control the infection. The risks and benefits of treatment with CIBINQO should be carefull y considered prior to reinitiating therap y with CIBINQO [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ].6Hematologic Abnormalities Recommendations for CIBINQO discontinuation for laboratory abnormalities are summarized in Table 2. Table 2. Recomm endations for CIBINQO Discontinuation for Hematologic Abnormalities Laboratory Measure Recommendation Platelet Count <50,000/mm3Discontinue CIBINQO and follow with CBC until >100,000 /mm3 ALC <500/mm3 Treatment should be temporaril y discontinued if ALC is less than 500 cells/mm3and may be restarted once ALC return above this value ANC < 1,000 /mm3 Treatment should be temporaril y discontinued if ANC is less than 1 ,000 cells/mm3and may be restarted once ANC return above this value Hb value <8 g/dLTreatment should be temporaril y discontinued if Hb is less than 8 g/dL and may be restarted once Hb return are recommended at baseline ,4 weeks after treatment initiation and 4 weeks after dosing increase of CIBINQO . Laboratory evaluations may be extended for patients on chronic CIBINQO therapy who develop hematologic abnormalities [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]. 2.7Administration Instructions Administer CIBINQO with or without food at approximately the same time each day . Swallow CIBINQO tablets whole with water .Do not crush, split ,or chew CIBINQO tablets . 3DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS 50mg: Pink, ova l, film -coated tablet debossed with \"PFE\" on one side and \"ABR 50\" on the other. 100mg: Pink, round , film -coated tablet debossed with \"PFE\" on one side and \"ABR 100\" on the other. 200mg: Pink, oval , film -coated tablet debossed with \"PFE\" on one side \"ABR 200\" on the other. low -dose aspirin (81mg daily ), during the first 3 months of treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6), Drug Interactions (7.2), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ]. 5WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 5.1 Serious Infections The most frequent serious infections reported in clinical studies with CI BINQO for atopic dermatitis were herpes [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ].Serious infections leading to hospitalization or death, including tubercul osis and bacterial, invasive fungal, viral ,and other opportunistic infections, have occurred in patients receiving JAK inhibitors used to treat inflammatory conditions . Avoid use of CIBINQO in patients with active, serious infection including localized infections. Consider t he risks and benefits of treatment prior to initiating CIBINQO in patients : with chronic or recurrent infection who have been exposed to tuberculosis7with a history of a serious or an opportunistic infection who have resided or tra veled in areas of endemic tuberculosis or endemic my coses with underly ing conditions that may predispose them to infection Closely monitor p atients for the development of signs and s ymptoms of infection during and after treatment with CIBINQO . If a patien t develops a serio us or opportunistic infection, discontinue CIBINQO. Initiate complete diagnostic testing and appropriate antimicrobial therap y.The risks and benefits of treatment with CIBINQO should be carefully considered prior to reinitiating therapy with CIBINQO . Tuberculosis Evaluate and test patients for TB before starting CIBINQO therapy and consider y early screening for patients in highl y endemic areas for TB . CIBINQO is not recommend ed for use in patients with active TB. For patients with a new diagnosis of latent TB or prior untreated latent TB, or for patients with a negative test for latent TB but who are at high risk for TB infection, start preventive therap yfor latent TB prior to initiation of CIBINQO . Monitor patients for the development of signs and sy mptoms of TB, including patients who were tested negative for latent TB infection prior to initiating therap y. Viral Reactivation with Reactions (6.1) ].If a patient develops herpes zoster , consider interrupt ingCIBINQO until the episode resolve s. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation has been reported in patients receiving JAK inhibitors. Perform viral hepatitis screening and monitoring for reactivation in accordance with clinical guidelines before starting therap y and during therap y with CIBINQO . CIBINQO is not recommended for use in patients with active hepatitis B or hepatitis C [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Monitor patients with inactive HBV for expression of HBV DNA during therap y with CIBINQO. If HBV DNA is detected during therapy with CI BINQO , consult a liver specialist . 5.2 Mortality In a large, randomized, postmarketing safet y study of another JAK inhibitor in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients 50 y ears of age and older with at least one cardiovascular risk factor, a higher rate of all-cause mortality , including sudden cardiovascular death, was observed in patients treated with the JAK inhibitor compared with TNF blockers .CIBINQO is not approved for use in RA. Consider the benefits and risks for the individual patient prior to ini tiating or continuing therap y with CIBINQO . 5.3 Malignancy and Lymphoproliferative Disorders Malignancies, including non -melanoma skin cancer (NMSC), were observed in clinical studies with CIBINQO for atopic dermatitis [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Perform periodic skin examination for patients who are at increased risk for skin cancer. Exposure to sunlight and UV light should be limited by wearing protective clothing and using broad -spectrum sunscreen.8Malignancies, including lymphomas, have occurred in patients receiving JAK inhibitors used to treat inflammatory conditions. In a large, randomized, postmarketing safet y study of another JAK inhibitor in RA patients, a higher rate of malignancies (excludin g non -melanoma skin cancer (NMSC)) was observed in patients treated with the JAK inhibitor compared to those treated with TNF blockers .CIBINQO is not approved for use in RA. A higher rate of lymphomas was observed in patients treated with the JAK inhibito r compared to those treated with TNF blockers. A higher rate of lung cancers was observed in current or past smokers treated with the JAK inhibitor compared to those treated with TNF blockers. In this study , current or past smokers had an additional increa sed risk of overall malignancies. Consider the benefits and risks for the individual patient prior to initiating or continuing therapy with CIBINQO, particularl y in patients with a known malignancy (other than a successfull y treated NMSC ),patients who develop a malignancy when on treatment, and patients who are current or past smokers . 5.4 Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events Major adverse cardiovascular events were reported in clinical studies of CIBINQO for atopic dermatitis [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. In a large, randomized, postmarketing safet y study of another JAK inhibitor in RA patients 50 y ears of age and older with at least one cardiovascular risk factor, a higher rate of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) defined as cardiovascular death, non -fatal my ocardial infarction (MI), and non -fatal stroke was observed with the JAK inhibitor compared to those treated with TNF blockers .CIBINQO is not approved for use in RA . Patients who are current or past smokers are at add itional increased risk. Consider the benefits and risks for the individual patient prior to initiating or continuing therap y with CIBINQO , particularl y in patients who are current or past smokers and patients with other cardiovascular risk factors. Patien ts should be informed about the s ymptoms of serious cardiovascular events and the steps to take if they occur. Discontinue CIBINQO in patients that have experienced a m yocardial infarction (PE) were observed in the clinical studies for atopic dermatitis thrombosis have been reported in patients receiving JAK inhibitor s used to treat inflammatory conditions. Many of these adverse reactions were serious and some resulted in death. In a large, randomized, postmarketing safet y study of another JAK inhibitor in RA patients 50 y ears of age and older with at least one cardi ovascular risk factor, higher rates of overall thrombosis, DVT, and PE were observed compared to those treated with TNF blockers .CIBINQO is not approved for use in RA. Avoid CIBINQO in patients that may be at increased risk of thrombosis. If symptoms of thrombosis occur, discontinue CIBINQO and evaluate and treat patients appropriatel y.95.6 Laboratory Abnormalities Hematolog ic Abnormalities Treatment with CIBINQO was associated with an increased incidence of thrombocy topenia and l ymphopenia [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ].Prior to CIBINQO initiation, perform a CBC [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. CBC evaluations are recommended at 4 weeks after initiation and 4 weeks after dose increase of CIBINQO. Discontinuation of CIBINQO therapy is required for certain laboratory abnormalities [see Dosage and Administration (2 .6)]. Lipid Elevations Dose -dependent increase in blood lipid parameters were reported in patients treated with CIBINQO [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Lipid parame ters should be assessed approximately 4weeks following initiation of CIBINQO therapy and thereafter patients should be managed according to clinical guidelines for hyperlip idemia . The effect of these lipid parameter elevations on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined. 5.7 Immunizations Prior to initiating CIBINQO , complete all age -appropriate vaccinations as recommended b current immunization guidelines including proph ylactic herpes zoster vaccinations. Avoid vaccination with live vaccines prior to, during ,andimmediately after CIBINQO therapy . 6ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Serious I nfections [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Mortality [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Malignancy and Ly mphoproliferative Disorders [seeWarnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events [seeWarnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Thrombosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5. 5)] Laboratory Abnormalities [see Warnings and Precautions (5. 6)] 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely vary ing conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directl y compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice . The safet y of CIBINQO was evaluated in four clinical trials topical cort icosteroid, and 1 dose -ranging) and one long -term extension trial in subjects with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (AD). A total of 1623 subjects with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis were treated with CIBINQO in these clinical trials representing 1428 patient -years of exposure . There were 634subject swith at least 1year of exposure to CIBINQO . In the placebo -controlled clinical trials, a total of 1198 subjects were exposed to CIBINQO with dail y for up to 1016weeks. The median age of subjects was 33.0 y ears, 124 subjects (8.1%) were 12 to less than 18 years old and 94 subjects (6.1%) were 65 y ears of age or older. The majority of subjects were White (68.7%) and male (53.9%). While subjects aged 12 to 17 years were included in these trials, CIBINQO is not approved for use in pediatric subjects [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]. Adverse reactions occurring at 1% in an y of the treated groups and at a higher rate than in the placebo group are presented in Table 3. A total of 61 (5.1%) subjects treated with CIBINQOwere discontinued from the trials due to adverse reactions. The safet y profile of CIBINQO in the monotherapy and the combinat ion trial(s) were similar. Table 3.

Creatine Phosphokinase Elevations (CPK) In the placebo -controlled trials , for up to 16 weeks, events of blood CPK increased were reported in 6 subjects (7.5 per 100 patient -years) treated with placebo, 11 subjects (6.9 per 100 patient -years) treated with 100 mg of CIBINQO and19 subjects (12.3 per 100 patient -years) treated with 200mg of CIBINQO .Most elevations were transient, there were no reported adverse reactions of rhabdom yolysis. 7DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on CIBINQO Table 4includes drugs with clinically significant drug interactions affecting CIBINQO . Table 4. Clinical lySignificant Drug Interactions Affecting CIBINQO Strong CYP2C19 Inhibitors Clinical Impact Coadministration of CIBINQOwith strong CYP2C19 inhibitors increase sthe combined exposure of abrocitinib and its two active metabolites , M1 and M2 which may increase the adverse reactions of CIBINQO [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Intervention Dosage reduction of CIBINQO is recommended when coadministered with strong CYP2C19 inhibitors [see Dosage and Administration (2 .5)]. Moderate to Strong Inhibitors of both CYP2C19 and CYP2C9 Clinical Impact Coadministration of CIBINQO with drugs that are moderate to strong inhibitors of both CYP2C19 and CYP2C9 i ncrease sthe exposure of abrocitinib and its two active metabolites, M1 and M2 which may increase the adverse reactions of CIBINQO [Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Intervention Avoid concomitant use of CIBINQO with drugs that are moderate to strong inhibitors of both CYP2C19 and CYP2C9 . Strong CYP2C19 CYP2C9 inducers decrease sthe combined exposure of abrocitinib and its two active metabolites, M1 and M2, which may result in loss of or reduced clinical response [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Intervention Avoid concomitant use of CIBINQO with strong CYP2C19 or CYP2C9 inducers . 7.2 Effect sof CIBINQO on Other Drugs Table 5 includes clinically significant drug interactions affecting other drugs.13Table 5. Clinical lySignificant Interactions Affecting Other Drugs P-gp Substrate Where Small Concentration Changes May Lead to Serious or Life -threatening Toxicities Clinical Impact Coadministration of CI BINQO with substrate i ncrease splasma concentrations of P-gp substrates and may result in potential adverse reactions of the P -gp substrate where small concentration changes may lead to serious or life -threatening toxicities (e.g., digoxin) [see C linical Pharmacology Monitor appropriatel y or dose titrate P-gp substrate where small concentration changes may lead to serious or life -threatening toxicities when coadministered with CIBINQO . Antiplatelet Impact Coadministration of CI BINQO with antiplatelet therapy drugs may increase the risk of bleeding with thrombocytopenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5. 5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12. 2)]. Intervention Antiplatelet drugs ,except for low -dose aspirin (81mgdaily), during the first 3 months of treatment are contraindicated with CIBINQO [see Contraindications (4) ]. 8USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There isa pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to CIBINQO during pregnancy . Pregnant women exposed to CIBINQO and health care providers are encouraged to call 1- 877-311-3770 . Risk Summary Available data from pregnancies reported in clinical trials with CIBINQO are not sufficient to establish a drug - associated risk for major birth defects, miscarriage, or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes . In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of abrocitinib to pregna nt rats and rabbits during organogenesis at exposure 14or 5times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on AUC comparison , respectivel y, resulted in maternal d ystocia and skeletal variations in rats and no adverse effects in rabbits (see Data ). The background risks of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown. All pregnancies carry some risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcomes . The background risks in the U.S. general population of major birth defects and miscarriages are 2 -4% and 15 -20% of clinicall y recognized pregnancies, respectivel y. Data Animal Data In an embry ofetal development study , abrocitinib was administered orally to pregnant rats at doses of 10, 30, or 60 mg/kg/day during the pe riod of organogenesis. No fetal malformations were observed. Abrocitinib increased the incidence of skeletal variations of short 13thribs at 30 mg/kg/day (14times the MRHD based on AUC comparison). Increased embry ofetal lethality and additional skeletal variations (cervical arches with reduced ventral processes, thickened ribs, and unossified metatarsals) were noted AUC comparison).14In an embry ofetal development study ,abrocitinib was administered orally to pregnant rabbits at doses of 10, 30, or 75 mg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis. No abrocitinib -related maternal or developmental toxicity was noted at doses up to 75 mg/kg/day (5times the MRHD based on AUC comparison). In a natal and postnatal development study ,abrocitinib was administ ered orally to pregnant rats at doses of 10, 30, and 60 mg/kg/day beginning on gestation day 6 and continuing through lactation day 20. Dystocia with prolonged parturition and reduced offspring body weights were noted at 30 mg/kg/day (14times the MRHD based on AUC comparison). Postnatal survival markedl y decreased at 60 mg/kg/day (22times the MRHD based on AUC comparison). No maternal toxicity was observed at 10 mg/kg/day (3times the MRHD based on AUC comparison). No abrocitinib -related effects on postnatal developmental, neurobehavioral, or reproductive performance of offspring was noted at doses up to 30 mg/kg/day (14times the MRHD based on AUC comparison ). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of abrocitinib in human milk, the effects on the breast -fed infant, or the effects on milk production. Abrocitinib was secreted in milk of lactating rats (see Data ).When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. Because of the serious adverse findings in adults, including risks of serious infections, malignancy , and thrombosis, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with CIBINQO and for one day after the last dose (approximately 5-6 elimination half -lives) . Data Animal Data Lactating female rats were orally administered a single dose of 10 mg/kg abrocitinib on lactation day 12. Abrocitinib AUC was approximately 5times greater in milk than in plasma . 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Infertility Females Based on the findings in rats, o ral administration of CIBINQO may impair female fertility . Impaired fertility in female rats was reversible 1month after cessation of abrocitinib oral administration [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safet y and effectiveness of CIBINQO have not been established in pediatric patients. Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data In a juvenile animal toxicity study , abrocitinib was administered orall y to juvenile rats at doses of 5, 25, and 75mg/kg/day beginning on postnatal day 10 (approximately equivalent to a human infant) and continuing through postnatal day 63(approximately equivalent to an adolescent) . Abrocit inib caused a reversible, dose - related decrease in the primary spongiosa in the metaphy sis of the proximal tibia and distal femur. Abrocitinib produced adverse effects on bone development at all dose levels. Abrocitinib caused irreversible dose -related small or misshapen femoral heads doses mg/kg/day the on AUC comparison). 15Abrocitinib also irreversibly decreased femur size and caused paw malrotation and limb impairment at doses 25 mg/kg/day (10times the MRHD based on AUC comparison). At 75 mg/kg/day (36times the MRHD based on AUC comparison), paw fractures generall y corresponded to limb impairment, a fractured tibia was noted in a single female, and effects noted at lower doses were increased in frequency and severit y.Irreversible bone findings have not been observed in older animals. 8.5 Geriatric Use A total of 145 (4.6%) patients 65 years of age and older , while 25 (0.8%) were 75 years of age and older, were enrolled in CIBINQO clinical trials.Clinical trials of CIBINQ Odid not include sufficient numbers of patients 65years of age and older to determine whether they respond differentl y from younger adult patients . A higher proportion of patients 65 years of age and older discontinued from clinical trials compared to y ounger patients. Among all patients exposed to CIBINQO ,including the long -term extension trial, confirmed ALC <500/mm3occurred onl y in patients 65 years of age and older .Ahigher proportion of patients 65 years of age and older had platelet count s <75 ,000/mm3. The incidence rate of herpes zoster in patients 65 years of age and older treated with CIBINQO(7.40 per 100 patient -years) was higher than that of patients 18 to less than 65years of age ( 3.44 per 1 00patient -years). 8.6 Renal Impairment In patients with severe (eGFR <30 mL/min) and moderate (eGFR 30 combined exposure ( AUC inf,u)of abrocitinib and its two active metabolites, M1 and M2, is increased compared to patients with normal renal function (eGFR 90mL/min)[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. This may increase the risk of adverse reactions such as infections. CIBINQO is not recommended for use in patients with severe renal impairment and ESRD including t hose on renal replacement [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. A dosage reduction in patient with moderate renal impairment is recommended .No dosage adjustment is required in patients with mild renal impairment (eGFR 60 -89mL/min) [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. CIBINQO has not been studied in patient s on renal replacement therap y.In Phase 3 clinical trials , CIBINQO was not evaluated in patients with atopic dermatitis with baseline creatinine clearance values less than 40mL/min. 8.7 Hepa tic Impairment Avoid use of CIBINQO in patients with severe (Child Pugh C) hepatic impairment. Dosageadjustment is notrequired in patients with mild (Child Pugh A) or moderate (Child Pugh B) hepatic impairment based on similar combined exposure (AUC inf,u) of abrocitinib and its two active metabolites, M1 and M2 compared to patients with normal hepatic function. In clinical trials , CIBINQO was not evaluated in patients with severe (Child Pugh C) hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.8 CYP2C19 Poor Metabolizers In patients who are CYP2C19 poor metabolizers, the AUC of abrocitinib is increased compared to CYP2C19 normal metabolizers due to reduced metabolic clearance. Dosage reduction of CIBINQO is recommended in patients who are known or suspected to be CYP2C19 poor metabolizers based on genot ype or previous 16history /experience with other CYP2C19 substrates [see Dosage and Administration (2. 4)and Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ]. 10OVERDOSAGE There is no experience regarding human overdosage with CIBINQO . There is no specific antidote for overdose with CIBINQO . In case of an overdose, call Poison Control Center at 1 -800-222-1222 for latest recommendations. 11DESCRIPTION CIBINQO (abrocitinib) tablets contain the base of abrocitinib Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor, for oral administration . Abrocitinib is a white to pale colored powder with chemical is 0.04 mg/mL at 25\u00baC. Abrocitinib has a molecular weight of 323.42 g/mol and a molecular formula of C14H21N5O2S. The structural formula of abrocitinib is: Each film -coated tablet contains 50mg or 100 mg or 200 mg of abrocitinib and the following inactive ingredients: dibasic calcium phosphate and triacetin. 12CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism (JAK) inhibitor. JAK1 by blocking the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding site. In a cell -free isolated enzy me assay , well as the broader kinome. The relevance of inhibition of specific JAK enzy mes 17to therapeutic effectiveness is not currently known. Both the parent co mpound and the active metabolites inhibit JAK1 activity in vitro with similar levels of selectivity . 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Treatment with CIBINQO was associated with dose -dependent reduction in serum markers of inflammation, including high sensitivity C -reactive protein (hsCRP) ,interleukin -31 (IL -31) and thy mus and activation regulated chemokine (TARC) . These changes returned to near baseline within 4weeks of drug discontinuation . Effect on Platelet Count Treatment with CIBINQO was also associated with a transient, dose -dependent decrease in platelet count with the nadir occurring at a median of 24 day s after continuous administration of abrocitinib 200 mg once dail y. The percent change from baseline of the nadir increases with decre asing baseline platelet counts (-41.2%, -26.5% for platelet counts of 170 , 220, and 270 \u00d7103/mm3, respectively). Recovery of platelet count (~40% recovery by 12 weeks) occurred without discontinuation of the treatment. Cardiac Electr ophy siology At a dose 3 times the maximum approved recommended dose, abrocitinib does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Abrocitinib plasma Cmax and AUC increased dose proportionally up to 200mg. Stead y-state plasma concentrations of abrocitinib are achieved within 48 hours after once daily administration. Absorption Abrocitinib is absorbed with over 91% extent of oral absorption and absolute oral bioavailability of approximately 60%. The peak pl asma concentrations of abrocitinib arereached within 1 hour. Effect of Food Coadministration of CIBINQO with a high -fat, high -calorie meal (total 916calories, with approximate distribution of 5 5% fat, 29% carboh ydrates, and 16% protein) had no clinically relevant effect on abrocitinib exposures (AUC and C max of abrocitinib increased by approximately 26% and 29%, respectively , and T max was prolonged b y 2hours) [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.7)]. Distribution After intravenous administration, the volume of distribution of abrocitinib is approximately 100L. Approximately 64%, 37% and 29% of circulating abrocitinib active metabolites M1 and M2 , respectivel y,are bound to plasma proteins. Abrocitinib and its active metabolites M1 and M2 bind predominantly to albumin and distribute equall y between red blood cells and plasma.18Elimination Abrocitinib is eliminated primarily by metabolic clearance mechanisms . The mean elimination half-livesof abrocitinib and its two active metabolites, M1 and M2, range 3 to 5 hours. Metabolism The metabolism of abrocitinib is mediated by stud y, abrocitinib was the most prevalent circulating species, with two active polar mono -hydroxylated metabolites identified as M1 (3 -hydroxy propy l), and M2 (2 -hydroxypropyl). Metabolite M1 is less active than abrocitinib while metabolite M2 is as active as the parent. Thepharmacologic activity of abrocitinib is attributable to the unbound exposure of parent molecule (~60%) as well as M1 (~10%) and M2 (~30%) in sy stemic circulation. The sum of unbound exposures of abrocitinib , M1 and M2, each expressed in molar units and a djusted for relative potencies, is referred to as the combined exposure of abrocitinib and its two active metabolites, M1 and M2 . Excretion After a single radiolabeled abrocitinib dose, less than 1% of the dose was excreted in urine as unchanged drug. The metabolites of abrocitinib , M1 andM2 are excreted predominantl y in urine, and are substrates of OAT3 transporter. Specific Populations Body weight, sex, race, and age did not have a clinically meaningful effect o n CIBINQO exposure. Patients with Renal Impairment In a renal impairment study , subjects with severe (eGFR <30 mL/min as estimated 30 -59mL/min, MDRD ) renal impairment had approximately 191% and 110% increase in the combined exposure (AUC inf,u) of abrocitinib and its active metabolites, M1 and M2 , respectively , compared to subjects with normal renal function (eGFR 90mL/min , MDRD ). Based on these results, a clinically significant increase in the combined exposure of abrocitinib and its active metabolites, M1 and M2 ,is not expected in subjects with mild renal impairment ( eGFR 60 -89mL/min, MDRD )[see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Use in Specific Population (8.6) ]. CIBINQO has not been studied in subjects on renal replacement therap y[see Dosage and Administration (2. 3) and Use in Specific Population (8.6) ]. In Phase 3 clinical studies , CIBINQO was not evaluated in subjects with atopic dermatitis with baseline creatinine clearance values less than 40 mL/min. Patients with Hepatic Impairment Subjects with mild hepatic impairment (Child Pugh A) had approximately 4% decrease in the combined exposure (AUC inf,u) of abrocitinib and its two active metabolites, M1 and M2 ,compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. Subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child Pugh B) had approximately 15% increase in the combined exposure ( AUC inf,u) of abrocitinib and its two active metabolites, M1 and M2, compared to subjects with normal hepatic fun ction. These changes are not clinically significant. In clinical studies , CIBINQO has not been studied in subjects with severe (Child Pugh C) hepatic impairment, or in subjects19screened positive for active hepatitis B or hepatitis C[see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Drug Interaction Studie s Clinical Studies The effect of coadministered drugs on the pharmacokinetics of abrocitinib is presented in Table 6 . Table 6 .Change in Pharmacokinetics of the Combined Exposure of Abrocitinib and its Two Active Metabolites (M1 and M2) in the Presence of Coadministered Drugs Coadministered Drugs Regimen of Coadministered (7.1) 9 days100 mg Fluconazole [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]400 mg on Day 1 and 200 mg on Day s 2-7100 mg 1.23 (1.08 mg 1.30 (1.04 -1.63) 1.66 (1.52 max,u compare coadministration the drug with of abrocitinib alone.b When coadministered with Fluconazole ,thesystemic exposure of abrocitinib was approximately 4.8 -fold higher compared to when abrocitinib is administered alone . cDrug interaction with OAT3 inhibitor is not clinically significant. The effect of abrocitinib on the pharmacokinetics of coadmin istered drugs is presented in Table 7.

These increases in dabigatran exposure are not considered clinicall y significant change. However, appropriate dose titration of P -gp substrate where small concentration cha nges may lead to serious or life -threatening toxicities (e.g., digoxin) when coadministered with the CIBINQO would needed. In Vitro Studies Cytochrome P450 (CYP) Enzymes :Abrocitinib and its metabolites M1 and M2 are not inhibitors inducers UGT1A1, UGT1A4, cation transporter (OCT)1 but is not an inhibitor of organic anion transporting pol ypeptide Patients who are CYP 2C19 poor me tabolizers have little to no CY P2C19 enzy me function compared to CYP2C19 normal metabolizers that have fully functional CYP 2C19 enzy mes. After single doses of metabolizers demonstrated dose -normalized AUC of abrocitinib values that were 2.3 -fold higher when compared to CYP2C19 normal metabolizers .Approximately 3-5% of Caucasians and Blacks and 15 to 20% of Asians are CYP2C19 poor metabolizers [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.8) ]. 13NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility In a 2 -year oral carcinogenicity study in rats, abrocitinib increased the incidence of benign thy momas in female rats at doses of 10 and 30 mg/kg/day (4and 19times the MRHD, respectively , based on AUC comparison). Abrocitinib was not carcinogenic in female rats at 3 mg/kg/day (0.8 times the MRHD based on AUC comparison) or male rats at doses up to 30 mg/kg/day (19times the MRHD based on AUC comparison). Abroc itinib was not carcinogenic in Tg.rasH2 mice at oral doses up to 60 mg/kg/day in males and 75 mg/kg/day in females. Abrocitinib wasnot mutagenic in the bacterial assa y (Ames assay). Although abrocitinib marrow micronucleus assay . Abrocitinib did not impair male fertility at doses up to 70 mg/kg/day (35times the MRHD based on AUC comparison) or female fertility at 10 mg/kg/day (3times the MRHD based on AUC comparison). Abrocitinib impaired female fertility (reducing fertility index, corpora lutea, and implantation sites) at 70 mg/kg/day (39 times the M RHD based on AUC comparison). Impaired fertility in female rats reversed 1 month after cessation of abrocitinib administration.2114CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy of CIBINQO as monotherap y and in combination with background topical corticosteroids were evaluated in 3 randomi zed, double subjects 12years of age and older (CIBINQO is not approved for use in pediatric patients )with moderate -to-severe atopic dermatitis as defined by Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score 3, Eczema Area and Severit y Index (EASI) score 16, bod y surface area (BSA) involvement 10%, and Peak Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (PP -NRS) 4 at the basel ine visit prior to randomization. Overall , 53% of subjects were male, 6 9% of subjects were white ,64% of subjects had a baseline IGA score of 3 (moderate AD), and 36% of subjects had a baseline IGA score of 4 (severe AD). The baseline mean EASI score was 30. The baseline mean age was 36 y ears old with 8% of subjects 12 to less than 18 y ears old and 92% of subjects 18 years of age or older. Subjects in these trials were those who had inadequate response to previous topical therap y, or were subjects forwhom topical treatments were medically inadvisable, or who had received systemic therapies including dupilumab . In each of the trials , over 40% of subjects had prior exposure to systemic therapy . In Trial -AD-1 and Trial -AD-2, 6%of the subjects had received dupilumab, whereas prior use of dupilumab was not allowed in Trial -AD-3. Trial -AD-1, Trial -AD-2, and Trial -AD-3assessed the co -primary endpoints of IGA and EASI -75 response sat Week 12. The designs of the trials are summarized in Table 8.

For Medical Information about CIBINQO , Guide CIBINQO (Si BINK oh) (abrocitinib) tablets, for oral use What is the most important information I should know about CIBINQO ? CIBINQO may cause serious side effects, including: 1. Serious infections CIBINQO is a medicine that affects your immune system. CIBINQO can lower the ability of your immune system to fight infections. Some people have had serious infections while taking CIBINQO or other similar medicines , including tuberculosis (TB), and infections caused by bacteria, fungi, or viruses that can spread thr oughout the body. Some people have died from these infections. Your healthcare provider should test you for TBbefore starting treatment with CIBINQO . Your healthcare provider should watch you closely for signs and symptoms of TB during treatment with CIBINQO . You should not start taking CIBINQO if you have any kind of infection unless your healthcare provider tells you it is okay . You may be at a higher risk of developing shingles (herpes zoster). Before starting CIBINQO , tell your healthcare provide rif you: are being treated for an infection. have had an infection that does not go away or that keeps coming back. have diabetes, chronic lung disease, HIV, or a weak immune system. have TB or have been in close contact with someo ne with TB. have had shingles (herpes zoster). have had hepatitis B or hepatitis C. live or have lived or have traveled to certain parts of the country (such as the Ohio and Mississippi River valleys and the Southwest) where there is an increased chance for getting certain kinds of fungal infections.
