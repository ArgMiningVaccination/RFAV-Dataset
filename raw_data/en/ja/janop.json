Weekly Overview This digest updates every Tuesday to inform healthcare providers, hospitals leadership, policymakers and the public on issues related to the coronavirus pandemic. The Daily COVID -19 Digest includes information about : (A) Pandemic Status (B) Face Masks (C) Tracking, Anticipating Spread and Hospitalizations (D) Pharmacologic Treatment of COVID -19 (E) Vaccine development (F) Relevant Government Actions (G) Other Relevant Developments 2 Key Highlights Nationally, new COVID -19 new cases and hospitalizations increased dramatically since December 1, 2022. In Kansas, over the past week s, there was a very large spike in new cases in all parts of the state. and new reported deaths remain steady. New hospital admissions in Kansas average 38 per day. Forecasts predict that cases will continue to rise over the next 60 days, with the most increase expected in the KC metro area. KU researchers are collaborating with leaders in guideline development around the world to summarize existing recommendations in a living recommendation map https://covid19.recmap.org/ Vaccine availability varies by county. Details about vaccine distribut ion can be found here . A.

Face Masks , physical distancing , and vaccine updates FDA authorizes first oral antiviral pill for COVID -19: On December 22, 2021, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted emergency authorization to Pfizer's Paxlovid, a new COVID -19 treatment pill for mild -to-moderate COVID -19 in adults and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older , as well as patients at risk of developing severe disease. The primary data supporting emergency use of Paxlovid are supported by a randomized, double- blind, placebo -controlled clinical trial in non-hospitalized symptomatic adults with COVID -19. In the analysis, 1,039 patients had received Paxlovid , and 1,046 patients had received placebo and among these patients, 0.8% who received Paxlovid were hospitalized or died during 28 days of follow -up compared to 6% of the patients who received placebo. Paxlovid reduced COVID -19 related hospitalization or death from any cause by 88% compared to placebo . The FDA stated that the safety and effectiveness of Paxlovid continue to be evaluated. FDA authorizes monoclonal antibodies for prevention of COVID -19: December 08, 2021, the FDA authorized an emergency use of the first injectable monoclonal antibod y, Evusheld, for the prevention of COVID -19 among immunocompromised individuals without exposure to COVID -19. The authorization only applies to certain individuals with moderate to severely compromised immune systems due to a medical condition and/or medication and may not mount an adequate immune response to COVID -19 vaccination . The primary data supporting the use of Evusheld are from a randomized clinical trial in adults greater than age 59 or with a prespecified chronic medical condition . In the analysis, Evusheld significantly reduced the risk of developing COVID -19 by 77% compared to placebo, and the reduction was maintained for six months. The FDA stated that the safety and effectiveness of Evusheld continue to be evaluated. COVID -19 case surge across the US: On January 3, 2022 , The U.S. has reported a record single- day number of daily Covid cases, with a total of 1,082,549 new coronavirus cases, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University . The seven -day average of daily new U.S. cases is 480,273, the highest such metric of new cases in any country . The U.S. is also reporting an average of about 1,200 daily COVID -19 deaths . U.S. health officials have urged Americans to get vaccinated and boosted against the coronavirus given concerns over the new variant. C. Tracking , Anticipating Spread and Hospitalizations Projected local spread : As of January 1, 2022 the updated predictions based on a v ariety of widely used model s for COVID -19 pandemics suggest that : Surveillance of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths is essential to ensure accurate understanding of the current state of the pandemic and the effect of behavioral and policy effects on disease spread. COVID -19 relat ed death is the most robustly reported data point but is a lagging indicator of about 4 -6 weeks after any change in behavior . Hospitalizations are also lagging indicators of disease spread. 4 5 Green lines indicate actual events and blue lines indicate calculated events based on actual data of the number of cases. Estimates of hospital admissions (Kansas City metro area, Wichita metro area, and Kansas locations outside of the Kansas City and Wichita metro a reas) and hospitalizations (all locations) are excluded because they are based on assumptions from new case estimates instead of actual data. The link between new cases and new hospital admissions is increasingly unclear. Detailed notes about graphs: Data accessed : January 1, 2022 at https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data and at https://usafacts.org/visualizations/coronavirus- covid -19-spread -map/ . The shape of the data driven prediction is determined by existing data from other states and locations that are ahead of KS in regard to the pandemic. A major limitation of using this model is that we cannot forecast the effects of events (e.g. Memorial Day) that happen concurrently across locations. D. Pharmacologic Treatment of COVID -19 KU researchers ar e collaborating with leaders in guideline development around the world to summarize existing recommendations in a living recommendation map for COVID -19. Check the eCOVID19 RecMap KU researchers also collaborating and participating in conducting living systematic reviews that are informing WHO COVID -19 guidelines E. Vaccine development and distribution Vaccine availability varies in different counties. Details about vaccine distribution can be found here . Vaccine distribution per KDHE data as January 1, 2022, are shown below 6 7 Update This is a living document. Information in this document will need to be revised and updated in the near future. We will conduct ongoing reviews of the available evidence and continuously monitor the data to determine if information require modification. Based on the rapidly evolving nature of this pandemic, information will likely need to be updated daily. This do cument is not intended to establish clinical practice guidelines or the standard of care. Physicians should exercise their own clinical judgement in the care of individual patients.

Procedures like surgery, endoscopy or bronchoscopy can also lead to aerosolization and subsequent airborne transmission.1 Human-to -human transmission can occur from unknown infected persons (e.g. asymptomatic carriers or individuals with mild symptoms) as well as individuals with virus shedding during the pre-incubation period before symptoms develo p.2 Data related to the spread of SARS -CoV-2 in the early phase of the pandemic have confirmed that healthcare personnel are at higher risk of infection than the general population.3,4 Several types of PPE are available and summarized below. The WHO has issued guidance on the use of PPE, following a three- pronged strategy: (1) minimize the need for PPE, (2) ensure PPE use is rational and appropriate, and (3) coordina te PPE supply chain management mechanisms.5 WHO has developed recommendations for PPE use.5 KUHS Infection Prevention has developed similar, parallel, recommendations. Personal protective equipment (PPE) for health care personal and patients in the hospital PPE for healthcare personnel is needed to protect both individual providers and the healthcare system itself. Inadequate PPE supply may result in sho rtage of healthcare personnel due to infection and/or quarantine. Infected healthcare personnel may also act as a vector for transmission to patients. Hospitals and healthcare systems, including the University of Kansas Health System, face challenges in projecting PPE requirements and availability. Projections of future health system PPE use follow projections for total number of persons under investigation ( PUIs ) or contracts hospitalized, and I CU patients, emphasizing the urgency of reliable projections. Information need ed to make informed projections about the required PPE during the pandemic Reports of number of patients hospitalized, admitted to the ICU and requiring mechanical ventilation (available from data about hospitalized patients) Estimates of forecast of number of patients hospitalized, admitted to the ICU and requiring mechanical ventilation with best - and worst -estimate of when the peak will occur (best and worst -case scenarios) Historic utilization of PPE per isolated patient (available from data about hospitalized patients) PPE required per COVID -19 positive /suspected patient (available from data about hospitalized patients) Historical hospital market share , and projections of whether this is expected to remain stable throughout the course of COVID -19 serge Expected number and severity of cases in a specific hospital (both total and per week) Period of time that social distancing/community mitigation strategies must remain in place to manage the outbreak Types of PPE PPE Use Pros and Cons Surgical or medical masks - Droplet precautions - block large particles (>5 m) - Widely available - Does not require fit testing - Cannot be re-used N95 mask respirator - Filter at (<5 m) and droplet -size (>5m) particles - Requires fit testing - Can be used for an extended period and re- sterilized 9 powered air- purifying Respirator (PAPRs) - Provide high level protection from com mon airborne viruses that exceed N95 face masks - Does not require fit testing - Provides head and neck protection - Can be re-used by the same healthcare provider Gloves - Does not require fit testing - cannot be reused Gowns - Does not require fit testing "}
