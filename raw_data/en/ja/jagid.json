Disbudding and dehorning procedures cause pain and discomfort. The AVMA encourages the veterinarian-of-record to advocate for the use of procedures and practices that reduce or eliminate pain and distress. The veterinarian-of-record should advise clients on optimal disbudding/dehorning protocols for their herd and, in situations when the client will conduct the procedures themselves, train the client to properly complete the procedure. These include low stress handling methods, selection of polled genetics where appropriate, and the extra label use (ELDU) of approved AMDUCA-permissible clinically effective medications. Studies indicate that preoperative use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents and local anesthetics reduces pain and distress associated with disbudding and dehorning. The use of sedation protocols is also effective and appropriate in some situations. Veterinarians should ensure clients are informed about identification of acute and chronic pain behaviors and potential medical complications, and the appropriate use of any drugs. Persons performing disbudding or dehorning should ensure equipment is clean and in good working order, they are competent in conducting the procedure, and use methods and protocols that minimize pain and decrease post-procedure infection risk. All handling and restraint methods should seek to minimize stress and decrease the likelihood of injury. - Disbudding and dehorning procedures should be done at the earliest age practicable. - Disbudding is preferred over dehorning methods. Horn material attaches to the skull at approximately 8 weeks of age so disbudding must occur prior to this time. Properly performed disbudding causes less pain and distress compared to dehorning. - Pain control, such as the use of local anesthetics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), are considered the standard of care for disbudding and dehorning procedures. When appropriate, sedation is also recommended. - There are a number of acceptable disbudding and dehorning techniques as well as numerous pain management protocols utilized within the cattle industry. The selected methods and protocols should include consideration of relevant variables such as the animal's age, weight, temperament, skill level of the operator/technician, environmental conditions, available facilities, and human and animal safety. To eliminate the need for disbudding and dehorning, the incorporation of polled genetics should be encouraged as advancements in genomics and selection make this a viable option. The AVMA encourages research leading to new or improved techniques and approved pharmaceuticals that reduce or eliminate pain and distress associated with disbudding and dehorning.
